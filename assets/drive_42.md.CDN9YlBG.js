Rheault was best known for his role as a co-conspirator and commander of the unit responsible for the 20 June 1969 execution of South Vietnam double agent Thai Khac Chuyen, who compromised intelligence agents involved in Project GAMMA operating in Vietnam and Cambodia. Early life and education Robert Rheault was born October 31, 1925, to Charles Auguste and Rosamond (n√©e Bradley) Rheault in Westwood, a suburb of Boston. His father had served with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and was stationed in Labrador where he met Rosamond Bradley, from a prominent Boston family, who had been working at the Grenfell Medical Mission prior to immigrating to the United States in 1924.Frank McCulloch, \\"A believer in self-reliance and elitism\\", Life Magazine, November 14, 1969. pg. 36.United States Census 1930; Westwood, Norfolk, Massachusetts; Roll: 937; Page: 6B; Enumeration District: 135; Image: 1066.0. Rheault spoke French from an early age and attended Phillips Exeter Academy, graduating in 1943. He graduated in 1946 from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, and engaged in post-graduate studies at the University of Paris, and earned a master's degree in international relations at George Washington University.Jeff Stein (1992). Murder in Wartime: The Untold Spy Story that Changed the Course of the Vietnam War. (New York: St. Martin's Press) pp. 60-62; Military service and post-military career Rheault was awarded the Silver Star for his actions in combat in the Korean War, attaining the rank of captain. After Korea, Rheault taught French at the U.S. Military Academy for several years in the mid-1950s, attaining the rank of major. He attended the Special Forces Qualification course, the Q-Course, in 1961, and his initial Special Forces assignment was with the 10th Special Forces Group in Germany. He would later command the 1st Special Forces Group on Okinawa before being assigned to Vietnam to take command of the 5th Special Forces Group. Colleagues said of Rheault that he was one of the most respected and beloved officers ever in Special Forces, a \\"must promote\\" to general officer rank if his command, and career, had not been ended prematurely by the Green Beret Affair. Life Magazine cover from November 14, 1969 with Robert Rheault shortly after resolution of the \\"Green Beret Affair\\" All U.S. Army Special Forces in 1969 operated under the control of 5th Special Forces Group, headquartered at Nha Trang on the southeast coast of South Vietnam. There was a close relationship with the CIA that complicated the chain of command and philosophy of rules of engagement.L. Fletcher Prouty (1969). \\"Green Berets and the CIA: General Abrams strikes back\\", The New Republic, August 23, 1969. Colonel Rheault took command of the 5th in May 1969 and his unit was charged with seeking out leaks in a CIA-directed espionage ring as part of Project GAMMA. Rheault, along with six of his Special Forces officers and a sergeant were arrested by the U.S. military under the orders of General Creighton Abrams and threatened with charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, arising from the alleged extrajudicial killing of Thai Khac Chuyen, a Vietnamese double agent for the Americans and the North Vietnamese.Rheault and the mysterious case of Thai Khac Chuyen, Life Magazine, November 14, 1969. p. 36.online version The investigation and court-martial, held by the U.S. Army in Vietnam, rapidly became engulfed in a firestorm of media publicity. Most of the American public and the Special Forces believed that Colonel Rheault and all involved had been made scapegoats for a matter that reflected poorly upon the Army.John Stevens Berry (1984). Those Gallant Men: On Trial in Vietnam, Presidio Press, Novato, CA. pp. 151-63; The view that there was no wrongdoing by the soldiers was probably best stated by Rheault's 11-year-old son, Robert, Jr. who upon learning of his father's arrest said, \\"What is all the fuss about? I thought that was what dad was in Vietnam for ... to kill Viet Cong\\". However, the prosecution provided testimony showing that Chuyen was shot by Rheault's officers and his body dumped into the South China Sea. Further, they argued that Rheault was most certainly aware of the provisions of the Third Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war and Article 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He approved the execution of Chuyen, and also approved the cover story that Chuyen was lost on an undercover mission designed to prove his loyalty to South Vietnam and the United States. Judge Advocate General Captain John Stevens Berry called General Abrams and CIA officials to the witness stand, but both declined to testify. In September 1969 the Secretary of the Army Stanley Resor announced that all charges would be dropped against the soldiers since the CIA, in the interests of national security, had refused to make its personnel available as witnesses. On October 31, 1969, upon ascertaining that further military commands and promotions were not likely, Colonel Rheault requested immediate retirement from the Army. All others charged in the affair also had their careers effectively ended and left the service soon afterwards. The U.S. government later paid the widow of the Vietnamese agent a small pension, quelling her protests outside the American Embassy in Saigon. If there had been a trial, defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey said later, \\"the defendants would have become Abrams, (CIA Director Richard) Helms and Nixon. The only winner would have been North Vietnam.\\" After the war, Francis Ford Coppola, director of the 1979 film Apocalypse Now said that the character Colonel Walter Kurtz in the film was loosely based upon Rheault, whom he had become aware of through the 1969 news accounts of the Green Beret Affair. Upon retirement from the military, Rheault served as an instructor, program leader, and later, acting president of the Hurricane Island Outward Bound School in Rockland, Maine; retiring from the school in 2001 after 32 years of service. He also taught at the Northfield Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts. Rheault served on the board of directors of The Apprenticeshop, a traditional boat building and maritime school in Rockland, as well as on the board of directors of The Warrior Connection, a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to the rehabilitation of military veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Family life In 1947 Rheault married Caroline Young (1927‚Äì2006), a Vassar College student from New York, and they had three children: Susanne; Mich√®le; and Robert B. Rheault Jr. Like her husband, Caroline Young Rheault was fluent in French. She frequently traveled to and maintained a residence in France, and was an artist and book illustrator in Martha's Vineyard. Rheault resided in Owls Head, Maine, with his second wife, Susan St. John, married in 1977, and the couple adopted two children, Nicholas St. John-Rheault and Alexis St. John-Rheault. Rheault's son, Robert B. Rheault, Jr. (born 1958), is a marine biologist with a doctoral degree in biological oceanography from the University of Rhode Island who serves as the Executive Director of the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association. Death Rheault died on October 16, 2013, at his home in Owls Head, Maine. Rheault was interviewed for Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's PBS documentary series, The Vietnam War, which aired in September 2017, four years after his death.

However, there is no substitute name available at this moment (January 2012). Until such a substitute name is established, WoRMS lists provisionally the two species as distinct, although one is designated by an invalid name.

The whorls of the protoconch are very obliquely immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only the last half of the last turn is visible. The five whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, and faintly shouldered at the summit. They are marked by fine lines of growth and numerous very fine equal and equally spaced spirally incised lines, of which there are probably more than forty between the periphery and the summit of the last turn. The sutures are rendered subchanneled by the slight shoulder at the summit of the whorls. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are well rounded, the latter somewhat attenuated and marked like the spaces between the sutures. The aperture is large, and broadly pear-shaped. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is broadly recurved, thin, and showing the fine external striation within. The columella is slender, curved, and revolute. It is reinforced by the attenuated base and provided with a weak fold at its insertion, which is not visible when the aperture is viewed squarely. The parietal wall is glazed with a thin callus.Dall & Bartsch, A Monograph of West American Pyramidellid Mollusks, United States National Museum Bulletin 68, p. 210; 1909 (described as Odostomia (Evalea) amchitkana) Distribution This species occurs off Amchitka Island and Baranoff Island, Alaska.

The tower was built in 1929 by the Pennsylvania Railroad and remained in operation until it was closed in 1991 by Amtrak. Harris was purchased by the local chapter of the National Railway Historical Society in 1992 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.  Design  Harris Tower is a two-story, Colonial Revival-structure located at 7th & Walnut Streets in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It is situated southeast of the Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex and between the State Street Bridge and the Harrisburg Transportation Center. Its Flemish bond brickwork sits atop a partially exposed, concrete foundation; the stories are visually separated by a soldier course. The second floor contains the tower's interlocking machine, used to control signals and switches. The Union Switch & Signal Model 14 machine contains many steel bars that interlock with one another to prevent conflicts and sudden changes that could cause a derailment The machine is long, wide and tall. The front has 113 levers which were used to control all of the switches and signals in Harris Tower's territory. A tall model board is mounted above the machine. More than 450 indicator lamps of the model board show the current position of switches, locations of trains within the interlocking limits, and whether the overhead electric catenary is energized.  History The Pennsylvania Railroad completed its main line across the Allegheny Mountains, connecting Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, in 1854. By the 1870s, the Pennsylvania had connected New York City to Chicago and St. Louis; consequently, all freight and passenger traffic from New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., had to pass through Harrisburg before heading west. Harris Tower, then called HG Tower from its call sign when railroad communications were sent via telegraph, was built in 1929. It replaced three nearby towers that had been constructed in 1889. The consolidation reduced the manpower needed to control the and 15 sets of tracks north of Pennsylvania Station from 21 to 12. Harris Tower was put into service on April 26, 1930. The US&S; interlocking machine inside the tower Some of the tracks controlled by Harris were removed, and the model board revised, when a new engine terminal was built in conjunction with the electrification of the line between Harrisburg and Philadelphia in 1938. The territory controlled by Harris Tower marked the western end of the electrification of the Pennsylvania Railroad's passenger lines. The engine terminal assisted in the switching of electric locomotives to steam or diesel locomotives for the trip west of Harrisburg. The Pennsylvania merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central. In 1971, Amtrak took over intercity passenger service from Penn Central and also took possession of many ex-Pennsylvania Railroad tracks and facilities, including Harris Tower. Penn Central was taken over by Conrail in 1976. Conrail modernized its signalling control system in 1989 and consolidated it into a centralized traffic control facility located north of Harrisburg. Consequently, Harris Tower was reduced to controlling only four Amtrak trains a day. Amtrak combined the functions of Harris Tower with the nearby State Tower located in the Harrisburg Transportation Center on November 15, 1991, and closed the tower. = Current operations = On July 24, 1992, the Harrisburg chapter of the National Railway Historical Society purchased Harris Tower from Amtrak. The chapter opened the tower to the public as a museum, as well as allow visitors to operate the interlocking machine. Instead of controlling a network of signals and switches, it is connected to a computer which simulates train movements through the interlocking. The simulation uses Pennsylvania Railroad timetables from the early 1940s when the rail traffic at the tower was busiest. The tower is popular with railfans as an observation point for the numerous Amtrak and Norfolk Southern trains that regularly pass it. The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 30, 1994.

A spokesperson for the Sunni Muslim terrorist group Boko Haram later claimed responsibility and promised \\"more attacks are on the way.\\" Background Boko Haram have become more proficient in carrying out attacks since a 2009 clash with security forces that led to the death of its leader Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf, Since then it has either claimed or been blamed for numerous attacks on Nigerian government and civilian targets. Most attacks have been the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, though the group's name has been called out in other bombings such as in the capital city of Abuja. The group itself has since factionalised with some allied to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and some expecting terms of agreement similar to southern Nigeria's MEND insurgents. Attacks Among the targets hit were the headquarters of the Yobe State police, several government buildings and two banks, as well as at least six churches. An unnamed local official told reporters that hundreds of wounded people are being treated in hospitals after the devastation in the city of fifty thousand. Gangs or masked men roamed the streets for at least 2 hours, setting buildings on fire and engaging in street battles with security forces. Government officials confirmed at least 53 people died in a double suicide car bombing at the anti-terrorist court building and numerous witness accounts spoke of a death toll significantly larger than the current one. Hours before the Damaturi assault three suicide bombers attacked a military headquarters in Maiduguri and injured at least seven people. News reports suggest that the nearby city of Potiskum was also attacked, and on the next day Nigerian TV reported a firebomb attack in the city of Kaduna that left two people dead. At least three police stations and five churches were attacked. Suleimon Lawal, the police commissioner of Damaturu, said that two suicide bombers drove a vehicle laden with explosives into the local anti-terrorist court killing 53 people. Perpetrator As Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the attacks, its spokesman Abul-Qaqa said that \\"more attacks are on the way.\\" Reactions ;Domestic A government spokesman said that president Goodluck Jonathan was \\"greatly disturbed\\" by the attack, and said his government was working hard to bring those \\"determined to derail peace and stability in the country to book.\\" His spokesman Reuben Abati added that he does not consider the perpetrators to be \\"true Muslims,\\" as the attack occurred during Eid. He further added that \\"every step will be taken [to arrest the perpetrators]. The security agencies will tell you that what happens on this scale is even a fraction of what could have happened considering the scope of the threat. The security agencies are busy at work trying to make sure the will of the majority of the Nigerian people is not subverted by a minority [group] with a suicidal streak.\\" Jonathan also cancelled a trip to Bayelsa for his younger brother's wedding. Ibrahim Bulama of the Nigerian Red Cross said the death toll could rise. He also said that there was a fear of another attack. The Nigerian Red Cross has also promised to fully investigate the actual casualty count and release it in the coming days. Lawal said that as police commissioner \\"my strategy is a security strategy [that] I cannot disclose on air. So as [Boko Haram's not] disclosing their security strategy, I don't think it is safe for me to tell the whole world what I am doing.\\" Nii Akuetteh, a former executive director of Africa Action, said that: \\"The government has been saying that it will deal with [Boko Haram] and that it will get a handle on the problem, but it's not been able to. Previously, the attempt made was to try and fight them militarily ‚Äì to send the security forces after them ‚Äì but that has created its own problem. I know for a fact that there're Nigerian groups in and outside the government, including the media, who are suggesting that the government should try to talk to Boko Haram. But my own impression is that they don't seem to be particularly ready or inclined to talk.\\" ;International * ‚Äì The embassy issued an emergency warning to its citizens that bomb attacks could be possible at several luxury hotels across Abuja. Nigerian National Security advisor General Owoeye Andrew Azazi dismissed the warning as simply creating panic. ;Others Isaac Olawale, of the Oxford University Centre for Research on Inequality, Human Security and Ethnicity said that: \\"The present attempt to deal with the problem using confrontational strategies will not work. There is poverty all over the country and an increased number of Nigerians are jumping into the warm embrace of ethnic, chauvinist and religious fundamentalism. Boko Haram expresses some of the social upheavals we are witnessing in Nigeria.\\" David Zounmenou, of the Institute for Security Studies, said that: \\"The difficulty is the amount of weapons unleashed into the desert by the downfall of Muammar Gaddafi and of his supporters. Those weapons are simply flooding into the region, falling into wrong hands. Some of them are certain going to find their way to Boko Haram, or the al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb or other groups.\\"  References  See also *Nigerian Sharia conflict Category:2011 murders in Nigeria Category:Massacres perpetrated by Boko Haram Category:Boko Haram bombings Category:Mass murder in 2011 Category:Spree shootings in Nigeria Category:Terrorist incidents in Nigeria in 2011 Category:Suicide car and truck bombings in Nigeria Category:Yobe State Category:Islamist attacks on churches Category:November 2011 events in Africa ","title":"November 2011 Nigeria attacks"},{"id":"33649690","text":"\\"Second Generation\\" is a 2006 television advertisement introducing Nike's Air Jordan XXI brand of basketball shoes. The ad depicts signature moves from Michael Jordan's NBA career, recreated in the present day by twelve young basketball players around the world. Included are moments from the 1989, 1991, 1992, and 1998 NBA playoffs and the iconic 1988 slam dunk. The ad was produced by Smuggler and directed by Brian Beletic for the advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy. Casting began in November 2005, filming took place in January 2006, and the ad debuted on television that February. Advertising publications gave favorable reviews to \\"Second Generation\\", although it did not win major awards. The ad is also listed as \\"2nd Generation\\"; its tagline is \\"Let your game speak\\". Production The ad was conceived by the agency Wieden+Kennedy. Copywriters Derek Barnes and Paul Renner were in a shopping mall when they noticed many of the youths around them wearing Air Jordan shoes, despite Jordan having retired in 2003: \\"Just one look around the food court, you knew kids still waved his flag.\\" The creative directors were Kevin Proudfoot and Todd Waterbury. Waterbury explained, \\"We thought of the fact that a version of him is alive in everyone that loves basketball. And there are moments in Jordan's career where you just say the move, or the game, and people who love the man, and love the sport, immediately can imagine that scene. Here, we were just taking advantage of those incredible moments.\\" Wieden+Kennedy hired Brian Beletic to direct the ad. W+K art director Jesse Coulter said of choosing Beletic, \\"He gets it. He brings the flavor.\\" The music was composed by Jonathan Elias and David Wittman of Elias Arts. Casting calls were held in three U.S. cities. A November 2005 ad put out by Ulysses Terrero and T&T; Casting asked for \\"[BOYS] All ethnicities, ages 13-21, with amazing basketball skills ‚Äì amazing enough to recreate some of Michael Jordan's greatest moments on the basketball court.\\" Some 350 young basketball players auditioned over eight days; Beletic recalls the process as \\"an absurd amount of casting\\". The main challenge was in finding players who could match Jordan's jumping ability; the toughest shots were cast for older players. Casting was also complicated by the amateurism rules of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA): anyone who might play college basketball in the future couldn't appear in the ad. Filming took place in Los Angeles in January 2006. The action is set in the present day, across the world; various scenes take place in Africa, China, Chicago, and New York City. Each scene is a few seconds long, depicting a young basketball player recreating a famous Jordan moment in slow motion. The actors were not shown footage of the moves they were performing; rather, their performances were based on their own memories. The staff then \\"fine-tuned\\" the scenes for accuracy. Sequence The ad opens on a young man dribbling in place. The music starts with a simple ostinato C‚ÄìG‚ÄìB‚ÄìC line played by a muted synth bass. At 0:05, a young man wags his tongue while dribbling. This is a signature move of Jordan's. At 0:09, a player drives to the basket with his tongue hanging out. He recreates a moment from the 1991 NBA Finals, game 2: Jordan scored a layup after switching hands in midair to avoid Sam Perkins of the Los Angeles Lakers. The music starts growing in complexity, adding violins and a new bass line as a piano takes over the ostinato. At 0:13, the camera shows a young man chewing gum. At 0:15, a young man spreads his arms in a defensive stance. His jersey is colored red, yellow, and black to evoke Africa. At 0:21, an Asian boy palms the basketball. At 0:22, a young woman shoots a fall away jumper. The music adds a second violin line and a snare drum cadence. At 0:25, a young man performs a \\"rock the cradle\\" slam dunk. At 0:29, a young man recreates Jordan's free throw line dunk from the 1988 NBA All-Star Game Slam Dunk Contest. This is the only shot where the original scenery is imitated. The set colors match the colors of the Chicago Stadium, and the crowd is spaced out in the same way as the crowd during Jordan's dunk; they nevertheless wear modern clothes, as the ad is set in the present. The intent is that by this point, the viewer is aware of the significance of each shot. Waterbury said, \\"We built the action in a way so that it created tension in the spot. As the commercial continues to build, the viewer will recognize scene after scene after scene.\\" At 0:35, the camera cuts to the aftermath of The Shot. A young man jumps in the air and pumps his fist as another young man in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover dribble past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically punctuated with a bass drum roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three- point field goals in the first half of Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers. The rhythm of the music pauses for two beats. It resumes at a calmer level as the camera shows Jordan in street clothes, watching from the sideline. Jordan is shown for just two seconds, smiling and nodding. Waterbury said of this shot, \\"We wanted to make sure that, through this commercial, people understood Michael's role as a mentor and a coach. His nod of approval at the end is his way of saying, 'Go.'\\" The camera cuts back to the young player; the tagline \\"LET YOUR GAME SPEAK\\" is shown, and the scene fades to black with the \\"XXI\\" logo and then the \\"Jumpman\\" logo. Reception The ad received positive reviews from advertising publications. It listed by Adweek as the \\"Ad of the Day\\" and as one of the \\"Best Spots of February 2006\\". SHOOT named the ad their \\"Top Spot of the Week\\". ESPN's Darren Rovell wrote that \\"it deserves to be considered at the top of the list\\" of Jordan's more than 400 commercials. Creativity called the ad \\"impeccably executed\\", and Boards called it \\"so rich in detail that it entices in an instant\\". Second Generation did not win any major industry awards.

The use of multiple elements gives several advantages to an optical designer:Nathan Hagen and Tomasz S. Tkaczyk, \\"Compound prism design principles, I,\\" Appl. Opt. 50: 4998-5011 (2011). * One can achieve spectral dispersion without causing the deviation of the beam at the design wavelength. Thus, light at the design wavelength which enters at an angle \\\\theta_0 with respect to the optical axis, exits the prism at the same angle with respect to the same axis. This kind of effect is often called \\"direct vision dispersion\\" or \\"nondeviating dispersion\\".Charles G. Abbott and Frederick E. Fowle, Jr., \\"A prism of uniform dispersion,\\" Astrophys. J. 11: 135-139 (1900). * One can achieve deviation of the incident beam while also greatly reducing the dispersion introduced into the beam: an achromatic deflecting prism. This effect is used in beam steering.Bradley D. Duncan, Philip J. Bos, and Vassili Sergan, \\"Wide-angle achromatic prism beam steering for infrared countermeasure applications,\\" Opt. Eng 42: 1038-1047 (2003).Zhilin Hu and Andrew M. Rollins, \\"Fourier domain optical coherence tomography with a linear-in-wavenumber spectrometer,\\" Opt. Lett. 32: 3525-3527 (2007). * One can tune the prism dispersion to achieve greater dispersion linearity or to achieve higher-order dispersion effects. Doublet 400px The simplest compound prism is a doublet, consisting of two elements in contact, as shown in the figure at right. A ray of light passing through the prism is refracted at the first air-glass interface, again at the interface between the two glasses, and a final time at the exiting glass-air interface. The deviation angle \\\\delta of the ray is given by the difference in ray angle between the incident ray and the exiting ray: \\\\delta = \\\\theta_0 - \\\\theta_4. While one can produce direct vision dispersion from doublet prisms, there is typically significant displacement of the beam (shown as a separation between the two dashed horizontal lines in the y direction). Mathematically, one can calculate \\\\delta by concatenating the Snell's law equations at each interface, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\theta_1 &= \\\\theta_0 - \\\\beta_1 &\\\\theta_3 &= \\\\theta'_2 - \\\\alpha_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\theta'_1 &= \\\\arcsin (\\\\tfrac{1}{n_1} \\\\, \\\\sin \\\\theta_1) \\\\quad &\\\\theta'_3 &= \\\\arcsin (n_2 \\\\, \\\\sin \\\\theta_3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\theta_2 &= \\\\theta'_1 - \\\\alpha_1 &\\\\theta_4 &= \\\\theta'_3 + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\alpha_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\theta'_2 &= \\\\arcsin (\\\\tfrac{n_1}{n_2} \\\\, \\\\sin \\\\theta_2) \\\\end{align} so that the deviation angle is a nonlinear function of the glass refractive indices n_1 (\\\\lambda) and n_2 (\\\\lambda), the prism elements' apex angles \\\\alpha_1 and \\\\alpha_2, and the angle of incidence \\\\theta_0 of the ray. Note that \\\\alpha_i indicates that the prism is inverted (the apex points downward). If the angle of incidence \\\\theta_0 and prism apex angle \\\\alpha are both small, then \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\approx \\\\theta and \\\\text{arcsin} (x) \\\\approx x, so that the nonlinear equation in the deviation angle \\\\delta can be approximated by the linear form : \\\\delta (\\\\lambda) = \\\\big[ n_1 (\\\\lambda) - 1 \\\\big] \\\\alpha_1 + \\\\big[ n_2 (\\\\lambda) - 1 \\\\big] \\\\alpha_2 \\\\ . (See also Prism deviation panda dispersion.) If we further assume that the wavelength dependence to the refractive index is approximately linear, then the dispersion can be written as : \\\\Delta = \\\\frac{\\\\delta_1 (\\\\bar{\\\\lambda})}{V_1} + \\\\frac{\\\\delta_2 (\\\\bar{\\\\lambda})}{V_2} \\\\ , where \\\\delta_i and V_i are the dispersion and Abbe number of element i within the compound prism, V_i = (\\\\bar{n} - 1) / (n_F - n_C). The central wavelength of the spectrum is denoted \\\\bar{\\\\lambda}. Doublet prisms are often used for direct-vision dispersion. In order to design such a prism, we let \\\\bar{\\\\delta} = 0, and simultaneously solving equations \\\\delta and \\\\Delta gives : \\\\delta_1 (\\\\bar{\\\\lambda}) = - \\\\delta_2 (\\\\bar{\\\\lambda}) = -\\\\Delta \\\\Big( \\\\frac{1}{V_2} - \\\\frac{1}{V_1} \\\\Big)^{-1} \\\\ , from which one can obtain the element apex angles \\\\alpha_1 and \\\\alpha_2 from the mean refractive indices of the glasses chosen: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha_1 &= \\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{\\\\bar{n}_1 - 1} \\\\Big( \\\\frac{1}{V_1} - \\\\frac{1}{V_2} \\\\Big)^{-1} \\\\ , \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha_2 &= \\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{\\\\bar{n}_2 - 1} \\\\Big( \\\\frac{1}{V_2} - \\\\frac{1}{V_1} \\\\Big)^{-1} \\\\ . \\\\end{align} Note that this formula is only accurate under the small angle approximation. Double-Amici While the doublet prism is the simplest compound prism type, the double-Amici prism is much more common. This prism is a three-element system (a triplet), in which the first and third elements share both the same glass and the same apex angles. The design layout is thus symmetric about the plane passing through the center of its second element. Due to its symmetry, the linear design equations (under the small angle approximation) for the double-Amici prism differ from those of the doublet prism only by a factor of 2 in front of the first term in each equation: 500px : \\\\begin{align} \\\\delta (\\\\bar{\\\\lambda}) &= 2 \\\\delta_1 (\\\\bar{\\\\lambda}) + \\\\delta_2 (\\\\bar{\\\\lambda}) = 2 \\\\big( \\\\bar{n}_1 - 1) \\\\alpha_1 + \\\\big( \\\\bar{n}_2 - 1) \\\\alpha_2 \\\\ , \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta &= 2 \\\\frac{\\\\delta_1 (\\\\bar{\\\\lambda})}{V_1} + \\\\frac{\\\\delta_2 (\\\\bar{\\\\lambda})}{V_2} \\\\ . \\\\end{align} Thus, we can derive the expressions for the prism angles using these linear equations, giving : \\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha_1 &= \\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{2 (\\\\bar{n}_1 - 1)} \\\\Big( \\\\frac{1}{V_1} - \\\\frac{1}{V_2} \\\\Big)^{-1} \\\\ , \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha_2 &= \\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{\\\\bar{n}_2 - 1} \\\\Big( \\\\frac{1}{V_2} - \\\\frac{1}{V_1} \\\\Big)^{-1} \\\\ . \\\\end{align} The exact nonlinear equation for the deviation angle \\\\delta is obtained by concatenating the refraction equations obtained at each interface: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\theta_1 &= \\\\theta_0 + \\\\alpha_1 - \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\alpha_2 &\\\\theta'_3 &= \\\\arcsin (\\\\tfrac{n_2}{n_1} \\\\, \\\\sin \\\\theta_3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\theta'_1 &= \\\\arcsin (\\\\tfrac{1}{n_1} \\\\, \\\\sin \\\\theta_1) \\\\quad &\\\\theta_4 &= \\\\theta'_3 - \\\\alpha_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\theta_2 &= \\\\theta'_1 - \\\\alpha_1 &\\\\theta'_4 &= \\\\arcsin (n_1 \\\\, \\\\sin \\\\theta_4) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\theta'_2 &= \\\\arcsin (\\\\tfrac{n_1}{n_2} \\\\, \\\\sin \\\\theta_2) &\\\\theta_5 &= \\\\theta'_4 + \\\\alpha_1 - \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\alpha_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\theta_3 &= \\\\theta'_2 - \\\\alpha_2 \\\\end{align} The ray deviation angle is given by \\\\delta = \\\\theta_0 - \\\\theta_5. Triplet The double-Amici prism is a symmetric form of the more general triplet prism, in which the apex angles and glasses of the two outer elements may differ (see the figure at right). Although triplet prisms are rarely found in optical systems, their added degrees of freedom beyond the double-Amici design allow for improved dispersion linearity. The deviation angle of the triplet prism is obtained by concatenating the refraction equations at each interface:Nathan Hagen and Tomasz S.

When the tower opened on 26 October 2005, it featured an observation deck known as the Q1 Observation Deck which was owned and operated by Sunland. In 2006 it was sold off to the MFS group. In the late 2000s it was renamed the QDeck. Following the receivership of the MFS group in 2009, Ardent Leisure purchased the observation deck for $13.5 million. As part of a $1 million refurbishment, it was rebranded as SkyPoint in 2010. On 26 September 2011, the construction of the SkyPoint Climb began. In November 2011, Ardent Leisure began recruiting staff for the SkyPoint Climb with more than 100 people applying for the 12 available positions. The SkyPoint Climb officially opened on 14 January 2012. Following the purchase of the observation deck, Ardent Leisure has reported that profits have increased from $1.7 million to $4.93 million in the 9 months to March 2011. This gained the company a 15.4% return on their capital in the 11 months to May 2011. In 2012, the company began combined ticketing options with their other Gold Coast attractions, Dreamworld and WhiteWater World.

Biography Born in Plattsburgh, New York, Snelling was a son of Col. Josiah Snelling and Abigail (Hunt) Snelling. During Henry's infancy, the Snellings moved to the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota (then St. Peter's) rivers to build the U. S. Army fort that even today bears his father's name. Henry was educated at a military academy in Georgetown, DC. For a time he was the librarian of the New York Lyceum, In New York, he met Edward Anthony, from whom he learned about photography. Anthony was a manufacturer of photographic supplies, and Snelling came to work for him. In 1849 he wrote The History and Practice of the Art of Photography, which was published by his brother-in-law. This is supposedly the first bound volume on photography published in America. He also edited the Photographic Art Journal (1851‚Äì53 and 1854‚Äì60). This was later renamed the Photographic and Fine Art Journal. The firm E. and H.T. Anthony exhausted him, and he left in 1857. He sold the Photographic and Fine Art Journal. In 1871 he moved to Cornwall, New York, where he edited and published the newspaper, Reflector of Cornwall. In 1887 he had to leave that publication because he had become blind. Snelling married Anna L. Putnam in 1837. She was the sister of George Palmer Putnam and herself an author (Kabaosa; or, The Warriors of the West). Snelling and his wife authored plays together. Additionally, Anna translated de Brebisson's The Collodion Process in Photography for the Production of Instantaneous Proofs. Snelling died at the Memorial Home, St. Louis, 24 Jun 1897. Snelling was also known as an inventor. He invented an enlarging camera (1852), a blue glass filter, and announced, but did not develop, a color photographic process (1856).

The history of human habitation in the Andean region of South America stretches from circa 15,000 BCE to the present day. Stretching for 7,000 km (4,300 mi) long, the region encompasses mountainous, tropical and desert environments. This colonisation and habitation of the region has been affected by its unique geography and climate, leading to the development of unique cultural and societal organisation. Study of the history of the Andean region began in the 20th century, involving both historical and archaeological investigation. After the first humans ‚Äî who were then arranged into hunter-gatherer tribal groups ‚Äî arrived in South America via the Isthmus of Panama, they spread out across the continent, with the earliest evidence for settlement in the Andean region dating to circa 15,000 BCE, in what archaeologists call the Lithic Period. In the ensuing Andean preceramic period, plants began to be widely cultivated, and distinct religious centres emerged, such as the Kotosh Religious Tradition in the highlands. This was followed by the Initial Period. Various complex societies developed at this time, most notably the Chav√≠n culture and the Moche civilisation. In later periods, much of the Andean region was conquered by the indigenous Incan tribe, who founded the largest empire that the Americas had ever seen, named Tahuantinsuyu. The Inca governed their empire from the capital city of Cuzco, administering it along traditional Andean lines. In the 16th century, Spanish colonisers from Europe arrived in the Andes, eventually subjugating the indigenous kingdoms and incorporating the Andean region into the Spanish Empire. In the 19th century, a rising tide of anti-imperialist nationalism that was sweeping all of South America led rebel armies to overthrow Spanish rule. The Andean region was subsequently divided into a number of new states, Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador. The 20th century saw the growing influence of the United States in the region, which was increasingly exploited for its natural gas supplies. This in turn led to the rise of a number of anti-imperialist and socialist movements to oppose U.S. and multinational involvement in Andean South America. Lithic Period: c.15,000 BCE‚Äî3000 BCE The earliest period in which humans inhabited the Andean region was the Lithic period, sometimes alternately called the Early Archaic period. It was a period characterised by the use of stone tools, or lithics, as the main form of technology, and a hunter-gatherer mode of existence. =First colonisation= An early 20th-century illustration depicting two Lithic Period humans hunting a glyptodon in South America. After the evolution of anatomically modern humans in East Africa circa 200,000 years ago, the species spread across the African continent and into Europe and Asia. It was from the Bering land bridge between Siberia in Northeast Asia and Alaska in north-western North America that humans first crossed into the Americas. From there, vanguards of human groups headed south, colonising the rest of the continent before reaching the Isthmus of Panama and crossing into the continent of South America.Moseley 2001. p. 87.Burger 1992. pp. 08-11. Although there had been four biologically distinct genetic human populations in North America, as has been identified by DNA analysis, only one of these populations, that known as the Paleo-Indians, pushed as far south as Mesoamerica and South America, meaning that the indigenous inhabitants of that latter continent were genetically homogenous.Moseley 2001. pp. 87-88. Comparative analysis of indigenous religious beliefs across South America have led academics to suspect that the first Paleo-Indian colonists of the continent would have believed in a multi-layered universe in which the Earth was suspended between a celestial outer sphere and a cavernous inner sphere. There would have been strong taboos against incest, something that would have prevented inbreeding (a particular problem amongst the genetic homogeneity of the Indigenous South Americans), and instead marriage was controlled by social conventions, such as the development of moiety systems of societal duality.Moseley 2001. p. 88. The first pioneers in South America, migrating down south from the Isthmus of Panama, would likely have avoided the largely mountainous Andean region, because the upper Cordillera was glaciated, cold and sparsely vegetated, making life there difficult, whilst these early populations would have suffered from hypoxia. Instead, the early hunter- gatherer pioneers would have most likely stuck to the margins of the continent, where they could exploit the resources in the rivers, deltas and salt-water lagoons. Gradually, generation by generation, as the population grew, these Indigenous Americans spread out throughout the continent, with some groups eventually reaching the Andean region. They would have most likely initially inhabited the coastal lowland areas, only travelling up into the mountains to obtain resources like obsidian. Gradually, as their descendants became acclimatised to the altitude, groups of humans began to move up and inhabit higher points of the Andes.Moseley 2001. pp. 88-89. One of the earliest known Andean sites that have been properly investigated by archaeologists is that at Monte Verde in Southern Chile, which has been radiocarbon dated to 14,800 years ago. At this site, there was evidence for seasonal settlement along the sandy banks of a creek in the subarctic pine forests of the low southern Cordillera, at which were found preserved wooden and stone tools, remnants of wild vegetables such as potatoes, and the skeletal remains of five or six mastodons which had been scavenged or hunted by the human occupants.Moseley 2001. pp. 89-90. Other Lithic period sites that have been discovered in the Andean region include Los Toldos, Taguatagua and Quero, all in contemporary Chile, and Pikimachay, Jaywamachay, Huarago and Uschumachay in contemporary Peru; from the evidence unearthed at these sites it is apparent that at this time, the horse was the most commonly hunted species, although the sloth and guanaco were also apparent.Moseley 2001. p. 91. =Lithic adaptation= Due to the varied geographical areas in the Andean region, unique communities evolved to suit their own particular locations across the region in the latter part of the Lithic period. Archaeologists have defined these different communities by their unique types of stone tool designs, describing them as the Northwestern tradition, the coastal Paijan tradition, the Central Andean Lithic Tradition, and the Atacama Maritime Tradition.Moseley 2001. p. 92. It was also in this period that Andean communities first began to domesticate crops, genetically transforming various plant species from their wild counterparts.Moseley 2001. pp. 102-103. Pre- Ceramic Period: c.3500 BCE‚Äîc.2000 BCE The Lithic Period was followed by what archaeologists have called the Pre-Ceramic Period, or alternatively the Late Archaic Period, and is characterised by increasing societal complexity, rising population levels and the construction of monumental ceremonial centres across the Andean region.Moseley 2001. p. 107. It is the latter of these features that remains the most visually obvious characteristic of the Pre-Ceramic amongst archaeologists, and indicates that by this time, Andean society was sufficiently developed that it could organise large building projects involving the management of labor.Burger 1992. p. 27. The Pre-Ceramic Period also saw a rise in the population of the Andean region, with the possibility that many people were partially migratory, spending much of their year in rural areas but moving to the monumental ceremonial centers for certain times which were seen as having special significance.Moseley 2001. p. 114. The Pre- Ceramic also saw changes in the climate of the Andean region, for the culmination of the Ice Age had led to an end of the glacial meltback which had been occurring throughout the Lithic Period, and as a result the sea levels on the west coast of South America stabilized.Moseley 2001. p. 107. Despite these changes, many elements of Andean society remained the same as it had been in earlier millennia; for instance, as its name suggests, the Pre-Ceramic was also a period when Andean society had yet to develop ceramic technology, and therefore had no pottery to use for cooking or storage.Burger 1992. p. 27. Similarly, Andean communities in the Pre-Ceramic had not developed agriculture or domesticated flora or fauna, instead gaining most of their food from what they could hunt or gather from the wild, just as their Lithic Period predecessors had done, although there is evidence that some wild plants had begun to be intentionally cultivated.Moseley 2001. p. 107. =Ceremonial monuments= In the mountain drainage areas of the Andes, a series of ceremonial buildings were constructed that archaeologists have identified as being a part of what they called the Kotosh Religious Tradition.Moseley 2001. p. 109. One of the most prominent of these sites was that at Kotosh, after which the religious tradition was named. Located on the bank of the R√≠o Higueras, Kotosh was at an elevation of c. 2000 metres above sea level, and consisted of \\"two large platform mounds flanked by lesser constructions and a number of small structures on a nearby river terrace.\\"Moseley 2001. p. 109. Another notable example of the Kotosh Religious Tradition can be seen at La Galgada in the Callej√≥n de Huaylas, modern Peru, which again consists of two platform mounds and several surrounding structures.Moseley 2001. p. 109. In other parts of the Andean region, other traditions of ceremonial monument building also developed during the Pre-Ceramic period. Initial Period: c.2000 BCE‚Äî1 CE The development of ceramic technology in the Andean region, and the subsequent production of pottery for both cooking and storage, marks the beginning of what archaeologists call the Initial Period.Burger 1992. p. 57. The introduction of pottery was however \\"simply one part of a much larger socioeconomic transformation\\" along the Andean coast, as communities ceased seeing their coastal settlements as the major centers of activity in favour of more inland locations, and as such the former maritime-based economy was replaced by one that was dominated by irrigation farming.Burger 1992. p. 57. Intermediate Period: 1 CE‚Äî1600 CE =Middle Horizon= =Late Intermediate Period= Machu Pichu, a mountainous settlement that was inhabited during the time of Tahuantinsuyu. It was in the Intermediate Period that an empire rose up across the entire stretch of the Andes which was called Tahuantinsuyu (the Inca Empire), meaning \\"The Four Regions\\" in the Quechua language. Although drawing \\"heavily upon the technological and organizational accomplishments of earlier Andean cultures\\", the Incan rulers refused to accept these antecedents, instead claiming that prior to the rise of Tahuantinsuyu, the Andes had merely been inhabited by primitive warlike tribes that the Incan tribe unified under their own civilising influence.Burger 1992. p. 7. European colonisation: 16th to 19th centuries The Andean region became a part of the Spanish Empire. =Wars of Independence= A key figure in the Latin American wars of independence was Sim√≥n Bol√≠var; in gratitude the nation of Bolivia adopted its name after him. Post-colonial period: 19th century to present The flag of the Andean Community of Nations. =Post-war development= In 1969, five Andean states ‚Äî Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru ‚Äî founded their own trade bloc, the Andean Pact, and in 1973 were joined by Venezuela. In 1976, Chile withdrew from the Pact after President of Chile Augusto Pinochet declared the Pact incompatible with his right-wing views. The Pact was renamed the Andean Community of Nations in 1996. =The Pink Tide= In the 21st century, leftist presidents were elected to power in several Andean states, as a part of the wider \\"pink tide\\" then sweeping Latin America, in which the political left gained increasing power as a reaction against neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus. In 2006, Evo Morales of the Movement for Socialism party was elected President of Bolivia, whilst later that year Rafael Correa of the PAIS Alliance was elected President of Ecuador; both Morales and Correa were socialists, nationalising industry and opposing United States and corporate influence in their respective nations. Instead, both allied themselves with the government of Venezuela, then led by Hugo Ch√°vez and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela, and joined the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, a trade bloc between Latin America's socialist nations.Kozloff 2008.

Archaeologists have identified and excavated a number of these ritual centers; the first of these to be discovered was that at Kotosh, although since then further examples have been found at Shillacoto, Wairajirca, Huaricoto, La Galgada, Piruru,Burger 1992. p. 45. among others. These sites are all located in highland zones that are lower than the Puna, and yet there are considerable distances separating them. In spite of this, all these cases of highland preceramic public architecture are remarkably similar.Art and Archaeology of Ancient Peru utexas.edu Kotosh tradition shows numerous links with the Chav√≠n culture that emerged at most of these sites subsequently. Archaeological context Three cultural phases which preceded the Chav√≠n culture were identified at Kotosh, and at other related sites. =Mito period= Mito tradition was the earliest. This was a preceramic tradition. During this period, The Temple of the Crossed Hands was first built. The image of crossed arms is characteristic for the Kotosh temple iconography.Templo de las Manos Cruzadas de Kotosh =Wairajirca Period= This is when the first pottery appeared. =Kotosh Period= The Kotosh Period strongly maintained the traditions of the preceding Wairajirca Period, including the ceramic tradition. The Kotosh Period culture stratum was situated directly beneath the Chav√≠n culture stratum. Some Kotosh elements show links with the Chav√≠n culture. For example; stirrup spouts, plain rocker stampings, and curvilinear ceramic designs. There are also similarities in black paint on red ceramics. Kotosh Black Polished Incised pottery is similar to Classical Chav√≠n pottery.Izumi and Sono, 1963, p. 155Seiichi IZUMI, Pedro J. CUCULIZA, Chiaki KANO, INTRODUCTION, Bulletin No.3: EXCAVATIONS AT SHILLACOTO, HUANUCO, PERU. The University Museum, University of Tokyo, 1972 Kotosh The \\"type site\\" of the Kotosh Religious Tradition is found at Kotosh, about 5 kilometres from the city of modern Hu√°nuco in Peru. Located on the eastern side of the Andes - which is geographically known as the Ceja de Monta√±a - it is situated at the longitude of 76¬∞16'30\\" and a latitude of 9¬∞56' south.Izumi and Sono 1963. p. 1. Sitting on one of the lower terraces of this mountainous region, it was built along the right bank of the Higueras. Named \\"Kotosh\\" by local Huallaga Quechua speakers; the term means \\"a heap of stones\\", referring to the two stony mounds at the site. =Archaeological investigation= The first archaeologist to investigate the site at Kotosh was Julio C. Tello, the \\"father of Peruvian archaeology\\", who visited it in 1935 as a part of his wider general survey of the Huallaga basin. Although he did not undertake any excavation at the site, he did collect pottery shards from the surface. Two years later, in 1937, the site was then visited by Donald Collier of the Field Museum of Natural History, although he again undertook no extensive investigation. In 1958, the Japanese archaeologist Seiichi Izumi visited the site, accompanied by Julio Espejo N√∫√±ez of the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a, Antropolog√≠a e Historia del Per√∫ and Professor Luis G. Lumberas of the San Crist√≥bal of Huamanga University. Following on from this visit, Izumi led a team from the University of Tokyo, Japan on an excavation of the site from 1 July to 3 October 1960, as a part of their wider Andean Research Program, which had been going on since 1958.Izumi and Sono 1963. p. i. Their findings were then published in English in 1963.Izumi and Sono 1963. La Galgada Another prominent example of a Kotosh Religious Tradition center was that at La Galgada, located on the eastern bank of the Tablachaca River, the principal tributary of the Santa River.Grieder et al 1988. p. 1. The site sits at a south latitude of 8¬∞28' and a west longitude of 78¬∞9', in what is now the Pallasca Province, Peru.Grieder et al 1988. p. 4. Situated in the mountainous Andean region, it is at a relatively low altitude of 1,100 metres above sea level. The archaeologists who excavated at the site in the late 1970s and early 1980s decided to call the monument \\"La Galgada\\" after the nearest town, a coal-mining settlement about 2 kilometres to the north, although local people instead referred to it as \\"San Pedro\\". The site around la Galgada was first occupied about 3000 BCE by agricultural communities who constructed small chambers that were different from their houses, presumably in which to perform ceremonial activities. It is clear from the archaeological evidence that they spent more effort in constructing the various ceremonial and mortuary monuments than in homes for themselves, an approach common to most pre-modern societies across the world.Grieder et al 1988. p. 19. Archaeological surveys have established that during the Pre-Ceramic Period, at least 11 settlements had grown up throughout the Tablachaca Canyon, being concentrated on both sides of the river for at least 8 km near to the modern village of la Galgada.Grieder et al 1988. p. 9. This led one of the head excavators, Terence Grieder, to comment that the La Galgada site must be seen as \\"one of the most important ceremonial and burial areas in a larger, well- populated district, which in Pre-ceramic terms must be considered virtually a metropolitan center\\".Grieder et al 1988. p. 11. =Architecture= At the la Galgada ceremonial site, the most prominent architectural features were the North and South Mounds.Grieder et al 1988. p. 24. =Archaeological investigation= By the 1960s, la Galgada had become a busy mining town, and the site had come under threat from looters who wanted to dig up the site in search of valuable artefacts. However, the town governor, Teodoro E. L√≥pez Trelles, recognised the importance of the site for its archaeological value, and instituted measures to protect it from looters. In 1969, he gave a tour of the site to Terence Grieder of the University of Texas at Austin, who was then involved in the excavations at Patash, and who was sufficiently interested that he decided to investigate at the site following the culmination of the Patash project.Grieder et al 1988. p. vii. In 1976, Grieder and his fellow archaeologist Alberto Bueno Mendoza returned to the site, and after realizing that the site was Preceramic in date - far older than they had previously suspected - began to raise funds for an excavation. In 1978 this began, with the project continuing on until 1985.

The Metropolitanate of Gothia (also of Gothia and Caffa), also known as the Eparchy of Gothia or Metropolitanate of Doros, was a metropolitan diocese of the Patriarchate of Constantinople in the Middle Ages. The 9th- century Metropolitanate of Doros was centered in the Crimea, but it seems to have had dioceses further afield, as far east as the Caspian coast, but they were probably short-lived, as the Khazars converted to Judaism. From the 13th century until the Ottoman conquest in 1475, the Metropolitanate of Gothia was within the Principality of Theodoro (known in Greek as ŒìŒøœÑŒ∏ŒØŒ±, Gothia). In 1779, it was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church and disestablished a few years later. Early history The Goths came into contact with Christianity from the late 3rd century, and were Christianized in the course of the 4th century. Theophilus, the first known bishop of the Goths, defended the Trinitarian and Orthodox Christological position against the Arians at the First Ecumenical Council in Nicea 325, and signed the Nicene Creed.Cyril of Jerusalem, 'Teachings of Catechesis', 16:22 \\"Theophil, a bishop of the Goths, was present at the Council of Nicea in 325. Codex Syriacus ms. nr. 14528, British Museum. Alban Butler, 1838 p. 124. B. H. Cowper, Syriac Miscellanies, 1861, preteristarchive.com The evidence suggests that Theophilus was the bishop of a territorial see in area of Crimea. The bishops of Crimean Gothia were Nicene (whereas most of the Goths were Arians) and were appointed by the patriarch of Constantinople. The Crimean Goths themselves were a remnant of the migration-era Gothic population of Oium. The Byzantine Metropolitanate, however, was limited to a remnant of the Roman Crimea (the Bosporan Kingdom), consisting only of the southeastern coastal area of the peninsula. The Crimean Goths from about 370 were thus wedged between the Hunnic Empire (and later Khazaria) to the north and the Roman (Byzantine) territory to the southeast. The \\"Archdiocese of the Goths\\" existed autonomously during the 5th to 9th centuries, but from the 5th century there seems to have been a close relation to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. John Chrysostomos consecrated Unila (d. 404) as bishop of the Archdiocese of the Goths.John Jacob Maskov, History of the Ancient Germans, 1738, pp. 378-384. John Chrysostomos preached to the Goths with aid of interpreter in the Goths' church in Constantinople, which had priests, deacons and readers whom were Goths and read, preached and sang in the Gothic language. It was he who appointed the successor of Bishop Unila to the seat of ruling bishop over the Archdiocese of the Goths,Charles Archibald Andersson Scott, Ulfilas, apostle of the Goths: together with an account of the Gothic churches and their decline, Cambridge, 1885, p. 154. and acted as the protector and benefactor of the Archdiocese at this period.Herwig Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, History of the Goths, 1998, p. 78. In its disputed 28th Canon, the Council of Chalcedon in 451 recognized an expansion of the boundaries of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and of its authority over bishops of dioceses \\"among the barbarians\\", which has been variously interpreted as referring either to areas outside the Byzantine Empire or to non-Greeks. Byzantine metropolitanate John of Gothia (John of Partenit) was a Metropolitan bishop of Doros. During the period of Byzantine Iconoclasm, John reputedly gathered Orthodox refugees from Constantinople in the Crimea.–Æ. –ú. –ú–æ–≥–∞—Ä–∏—á–µ–≤, –ê. –í. –°–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ–≤, –ê. –ö. –®–∞–ø–æ—à–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤, –ñ–∏—Ç–∏–µ –ò–æ–∞–Ω–Ω–∞ –ì–æ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–µ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ö—Ä—ã–º–∞ \\"—Ö–∞–∑–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞\\", 2007, samlib.ru (–ì–õ–ê–í–ê V: –ù–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ö—Ä—ã–º–∞ –∏–∫–æ–Ω–æ–±–æ—Ä—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞) A bishop of Gothia attended the iconoclastic Council of Hieria in 754, but his flock soon expelled him and elected John in his place. John overthrew and expelled the Khazars from Gothia 787; the Khazars however managed to retake the city in less than a year, and John was imprisoned in Phoulloi. He later managed to escape, and sought refuge in Amastris in the Byzantine Empire, where he died in 791. His remains were brought home to a church on the Ayu-Dag mountain, where a memorial to him has been built. John's Vita was composed within a generation or so of his death, in the early 9th century.J. Shepard in: M. Mundell Mango (ed.) Byzantine Trade, 4th-12th Centuries: The Archaeology of Local, Regional and International Exchange: Papers of the Thirty-Eighth Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, St John's College, University of Oxford, March 2004, Ashgate Publishing, 2009, p. 424f. The Gothic church was incorporated into the Patriarchate of Constantinople at some point between the late 8th and the late 9th century. It was the first diocese established outside the historical boundaries of the Roman Empire (just before the Metropolitanates of Alania and of Rus'). Its existence is documented in a list of Byzantine dioceses in a Paris manuscript, dated to the 14th century, published by Carl de Boor in 1891. Its continued existence is a matter of doubt, as there are practically no records on it, and it may have been little more than a missionary project with the aim of evangelizing the Khazars, or essentially a diocese in partibus infidelium. The archidiocese with its seat at Doros comprised seven dioceses (most of which correspond to unknown or uncertain locations).Anders Magnus Strinnholm, Svenska folkets historia fr√•n √§ldsta till n√§rwarande tider, Vol. 1, p. 78. –ö—É–ª–∞–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –Æ., \\"–ö –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –≥–æ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π –µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ö–∏–∏ –≤ –ö—Ä—ã–º—É –≤ VII –≤.\\" –ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏—è 1898. –ß.2. –ù–∞—É–º–µ–Ω–∫–æ –í.–ï., \\"–í–∏–∑–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–π—Å–∫–æ-—Ö–∞–∑–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ IX –≤–µ–∫–∞\\" –•–∞–∑–∞—Ä—ã. –ú.-–ò–µ—Ä—É—Å–∞–ª–∏–º, 2005. . The first extant medieval record which confirms that the Gothic language was still spoken in \\"Gothia\\" is the Vita of Saint Cyril, Apostle to the Slavs (also known as Constantine the Philosopher) who went to Crimea to preach the gospel to the Khazars in c. 850. He lists \\"Goths\\" as people who read and praised the Christian God \\"in their own language\\".Loewe 1896:114. Medieval \\"Gothia\\" was still far from uniformly Gothic-speaking. Many \\"Crimean Goths\\" were Greek speakers and many non-Gothic Byzantine citizens were settled in the region called \\"Gothia\\" by the government in Constantinople. The official language of the Principality of Theodoro was Greek, but the Gothic language remained in use in private homes at least until the 18th century (Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq in the 16th century reported having had a conversation with two Goths in Constantinople, and left a Gothic- Latin glossary with about a hundred Gothic words), but it is unknown for how long the Gothic language survived as liturgical language in the Crimean Gothic church. Historical records grow more reliable only in the 13th century, with the emergence of the Principality of Theodoro, or Gothia. From 1283, the diocese was known as the \\"Metropolitanate of Gothia and Kaphas (Caffa)\\", whose direct jurisdiction was at Marcopia (modern Mangup).Paul Robert Magocsi, A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples, p. 118f. Gothia became tributary to the Mongols in the 1220s, but remained nominally independent. Caffa was established as a trading port by the Genoese, with the consent of the Mongols, in 1266. The Genoese during the 14th century came to control much of the southwestern coast of the Crimea. From 1287, Genoese arch-rival Venice also established trading posts on the Black Sea coast. Wedged between the Mongols in the steppe and the Italian powers on the coast, the Crimean Goths became limited to the Crimean hinterland and essentially pass out of the historical record. Timur Lenk devastated Doros in 1395, but Gothia remained nominally independent for another 80 years, until it finally fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1475.  Ottoman conquests and disestablishment  The Crimea fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1475 as the vassal-state known as the Crimean Khanate. The Crimean Goths managed to maintain their ethnic identity under Turkic rule during the 16th and 17th centuries, and in marginalized form even until the 18th century. The only surviving report of Gothic Christians in the Crimea is that of Joseph-Juste Scaliger who in 1606 claimed that the Goths of Crimea read both the Old and New Testaments \\"in the letters of Wulfila's alphabet\\". The Metropolitanate of Gothia and Kaphas continued to exist in partibus infidelium until 1778. Archbishop Gedeon resided at Mariampol, a suburb of Bahcesaray, capital of the khanate. For reasons unknown, he was sent by Patriarch Cyril V of Constantinople into exile at Varlaam Monastery for ten years from 1750 to 1760. In 1759, the Ottoman sultan Mustafa III issued a firman confirming the metropolitan's authority \\"over the Christians dwelling in Caffa, Mankup, Balaclava and Azov\\" in accordance with custom. In June 1778, Metropolitan Ignatios took the initiative to move the Christians of the khanate into Russia. This move had support within Russia, eventually even from Empress Catherine the Great. Ignatios founded the city of Mariupol. He retained his title until his death, but after him no further metropolitans of Gothia were appointed.

He was the first of six Derby winners trained by Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Larkspur achieved little of note either before or after his Epsom triumph. Background Larkspur, a light chestnut horse with a white blaze, was bred in Ireland by Philip Love. His sire, the American-bred Derby winner Never Say Die, was a qualified success at stud, getting the double Classic winner Never Too Late and becoming Champion Sire in 1962, largely thanks to Larkspur's earnings. Apart from Larkspur, his dam Skylarking produced eight winners, the best being the 1965 Dante Stakes winner Ballymarais. Ballymarais ran in the 2000 Guineas and was nearest at finish at 33-1,and when the weights for the Dante were published he carried only 7.11 and was 1-4 on for the race, which he duly won, he was trained by Bill Gray, owned by Bill Stoker and ridden by Brian Connorton. Larkspur was sent as a yearling to the Ballsbridge Sales where he was bought for 12,200gns by Vincent O'Brien on behalf of the American businessman Raymond R. Guest Racing career =1961: two-year-old season= Larkspur made little impression on his debut, finishing unplaced in a maiden race at Leopardstown in the summer of 1961. After a break he returned to Leopardstown in September to record his first win, taking a maiden race by three lengths. He was strongly fancied for the National Stakes later in the month, in which he finished a close third behind Mystery. On his final start of the year, Larkspur was sent to England for the Observer Gold Cup at Doncaster in October. He made little impression and finished unplaced behind Miralgo. =1962: three-year-old season= Larkspur's unremarkable form continued into 1962 as he finished unplaced in the Madrid Handicap over seven furlongs at the Curragh on his reappearance. In May however, he was moved up in distance and earned his place in the Derby field by winning the Wills Gold Flake Stakes over one and a half miles at Leopardstown. The runner-up, Sicilian Prince, went on to win the Prix Royal Oak. Larkspur suffered a setback in his training shortly afterwards and his participation in the Derby was only confirmed a few days before the race. At Epsom, in front of a crowd estimated at 400,000, Larkspur was sent off a 22/1 outsider in a field of twenty-six, being perceived as O'Brien's second string. The race was marred by an incident just after half way, in which seven horses, including the favourite Hethersett either fell or were brought down; one horse was killed and four jockeys were detained in hospital as a result. Larkspur's Australian jockey Neville Sellwood could not offer an explanation for the incident but said that \\"the horses fell right in front of me...I had a narrow escape\\". Larkspur took the lead two furlongs out and stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by two lengths from the French-trained colts Arcor and Le Cantilien. Larkspur failed to reproduce his Derby-winning form in three subsequent races. At the end of June he finished fourth at the Curragh behind the French-trained Tambourine when 9/4 favourite for the Irish Derby. His rider, Scobie Breasley, offered no excuses, saying that Larkspur \\"could never get in a real blow\\". He returned to the Curragh in autumn and started odds-on favourite for the Blandford Stakes, but was narrowly beaten by Sicilian Prince. He was sent to Doncaster for the St Leger, but could finish only sixth of the fifteen runners behind Hethersett. Assessment and Honours In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Larkspur a \\"poor\\" Derby winner.Randall, J and Morris, T. Portway Press, 1999, p. 205 The only lasting memorial to Larkspur's achievements is Larkspur Park near his training base in Cashel, County Tipperary which includes a \\"globally renowned\\" pitch and putt golf course. Stud career Larkspur stood as a stallion in Ireland for three seasons before being exported to Japan in 1967. He made little impact as a stallion in either country. Pedigree *Larkspur was inbred 4x4 to the 1929 Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Vatout. This means that the stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

He received a BS in civil engineering from the University of the Pacific, an MS in sanitary engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, and a PhD in environmental engineering from Stanford University. Rolf Eliassen was his PhD adviser at Stanford.Dr. George Tchobanoglous Is Awarded the 2003 Clarke Prize], National Water Research Institute Briefings , volume 12, number 2, Summer 2003, page 8. He joined the faculty of the University of California, Davis, in 1970 and remained there for the rest of his professional career, teaching courses on water and wastewater treatment and solid waste management. He has said \\"the University has basically been my life.\\" He is now a professor emeritus in the university's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He is a former president of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors. Tchobanoglous and his wife, Rosemary Ash Tchobanoglous, are the parents of three daughters.  Research  Tchobanoglous' principal research interests are in the general areas of wastewater treatment, water reuse, and solid waste management. In the 1970s he studied the use of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. One application of his findings was in his assistance to the city of San Diego in establishing an aquaculture facility that remained in use for more than 20 years. For the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) he directed the development of a series of four regional guidance manuals on the restoration, rehabilitation, and creation of salt marshes.Dr. George Tchobanoglous Is Awarded the 2003 Clarke Prize], National Water Research Institute Briefings , volume 12, number 2, Summer 2003, page 1. Tchobanoglous' investigations of filtration technologies for wastewater treatment led to California state approval of five alternative technologies in addition to the two conventional technologies that had been approved as of the early 1970s.Dr. George Tchobanoglous Is Awarded the 2003 Clarke Prize], National Water Research Institute Briefings , volume 12, number 2, Summer 2003, pages 1 and 8. His work in the use of ultraviolet radiation for wastewater disinfection began in the early 1990s, when he investigated the potential to use UV to disinfect wastewater in order to reclaim it for reuse. Guidelines for UV disinfection that he helped to draft in 1993 became \\"the standard\\" U.S. resource on this topic and helped foster the acceptance of UV disinfection as a technology for water reuse. In the 2000s, Tchobanoglous focused his attention on decentralized wastewater management, delivering numerous speeches on the challenge of providing effective systems to collect, treat, and reuse or disperse wastewater produced in locations where it is not practicable to provide sanitary sewers and centralized wastewater treatment.George Tchobanoglous (2003), The Importance of Decentralized Wastewater Management in the Twenty-first Century , 2003 Clarke Lecture, National Water Research Institute, pages 2‚Äì14. Students Tchobanoglous has advised many of the students that have become thought leaders on their own, including: Harold Leverenz, (PhD 2008) - currently a researcher at UC Davis David Austin, (MS 1996) - currently with Jacobs Engineering Group Dave Maciolek, (MS 1995) - currently with Aqua Nova Engineering Publications Tchobanoglous is the author or coauthor of over 600 publications, including 27 textbooks, and 8 engineering reference books. His textbooks are in use in more than 225 U.S. educational institutions. He also provided editorial consulting for the book series Water Resources and Environmental Engineering, from McGraw-Hill and provides national and international consulting for governments and private companies.  Presentations  He has given more than 625 technical presentations, with more than 450 as an invited or keynote speaker, in the United States and abroad, including Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. During the last 10 years most of the presentations have been invited lectures or Keynote Addresses.  Awards  Tchobanoglous received the Athalie Richardson Irvine Clarke Prize from National Water Research Institute in 2003. In 2004, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Award for Research and Education in Integrated Waste Management from the Waste-to-energy Research and Technology Council and was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering. In 2005, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Colorado School of Mines. In 2006, he was the Distinguished Lecturer for the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Texas. In 2007, he received the Frederick George Pohland Medal awarded by American Academy of Environmental Engineers and the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors. In 2017, he received Honorary Doctor of Engineering Degrees from the Technical University of Crete, Greece and Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. In 2019, he was elected Corresponding Member of the Academy of Athens. = George and Rosemary Tchobanoglous Fellowship = In 1999, the University of California, Davis, established an endowed fellowship for graduate students in environmental engineering, named for George and Rosemary Tchobanoglous. The fellowship is awarded to students working toward master's degrees without an expectation of candidacy for a doctorate. Tchobanoglous has supported the fellowship through donations. The focus on master's degree students is based on Tchobanoglous' concern that these students often lack access to the financial resources that are available to PhD students who can obtain funding by writing their own research proposals.

Design and development When the Daimler works entered the aircraft manufacture business they ordered a Union G.I from Union Flugzeugbau, which flew but disintegrated shortly before landing during a test-flight, due to severe engine vibrations. Daimler commenced to re-design the Union G.I, resulting in the Daimler R.I. Development of the Daimler bombers was accelerated by the use of former Union designers Baurat Rittberger and Ing. Karl Schopper, who proceeded to strengthen the structure and replace the Union G.Is troublesome inverted engines with upright Mercedes D.IIIs. Assembly of the R.Is and R.IIs took place at Sindelfingen, but most of the R.I and R.ll parts were built by the Stuttgart firm of Schiedmayer and taken to Sindelfingen for assembly. Flight trials commenced late in 1915 with relatively few engine problems but the structure had to be strengthened several times and three wing arrangements were also tested between 1915 and 1917. A second R.I was built with a larger tail unit to improve directional control. Daimler also built six almost identical improved R.II aircraft in 1916, two of which flew, the remaining four being crated and stored. The airframe of the R.I and R.II was typical of large German aircraft of the time, with a wooden fuselage and metal wings covered with fabric. The fuselage housed the crew in a gunners cockpit in the nose, cockpit amidships and a gunner's cockpit aft of the wings. The tail-unit consisted of a tailplane which supported a fin and rudder as well as two additional rudders at approximately half span. The undercarriage comprised a twin nose-wheel assembly, four main-wheels spread between the engine nacelles on the lower wings and a tail-skid. Engines were initially in tandem push-pull nacelles mounted directly on the lower wing, changing to streamlined nacelles mounted on struts mid gap on the R.II. Poor performance and competition from similar aircraft precluded production, but at least one R.I and two R.IIs were accepted by Idflieg and test flown till the middle of 1917.  Variants  ;Daimler R.I :The initial designation of the G.I, changed after discovery that the aircraft did not meet one of the major criteria for being designated as a Riesenflugzeug; the engines were unable to be serviced whilst in flight. ;Daimler R.II :The initial designation of the G.II, which was a refined version of the G.I, with improved structure and higher maximum weight and more streamlined engine nacelles supported on pylons between the wings. ;Daimler G.I :The R.I re-designated. ;Daimler G.II :The R.II re-designated.

The screenplay was written by former Charlotte Observer managing editor Mark Ethridge, basing it upon his novel Grievances, which was inspired by actual events. The film stars Steve Talley and Academy Award nominee Eric Roberts. Synopsis Deadline is the story of the murder of an African American youth in rural Alabama that has gone uninvestigated, unsolved, and unpunished for almost twenty years. That changes when Nashville Times reporter Matt Harper (Steve Talley) meets an idealistic young blueblood bent on discovering the truth. Harper undertakes the investigation despite the opposition of his publisher, violent threats from mysterious forces, a break-up with his fianc√©e, and his father's cancer diagnosis.Transcendent Films, LLC. Plot Young newspaper reporter Matt Harper (Steve Talley) is dispatched from Nashville to cover the murder of the police chief of Amos, Alabama. There he meets Trey Hall (Lauren Jenkins), a 21-year-old \\"blue blood\\" who lives on her family's hunting plantation. She wants Matt to investigate the nearly 20-year- old unsolved killing of a black teenager, Wallace Sampson (Romonte Hamer). Matt believes solving the murder will jump-start his career, and he begins to investigate. Being distracted, he forgets an appointment related to his upcoming wedding, which causes his fianc√©e Delana Calhoun (Anna Felix) to call off their engagement. Matt asks his editor, Walker Burns (Jeremy Childs), to let him look into the murder. While Burns notes that Matt is already on thin ice with the publisher (David Ditmore) for a lack of productivity, Burns allows Matt some time to investigate, on the condition that politically incorrect reporter Ronnie Bullock (Eric Roberts) accompany him. Matt and Ronnie discover old police files that point to a Klansman who operated 'The Store' near where the shooting occurred. The day before Wallace's murder, someone had attempted to firebomb 'The Store' during a civil rights protest. Just as the two reporters are making headway, Matt's ex-fianc√©e Delana tells Matt his father, Lucas (J.D. Souther), has cancer. Matt and Delana visit Matt's father, but later fight because Matt hasn't told his father about the broken engagement and because Matt is critical of his ill father. Matt and Bullock continue investigating without the publisher's knowledge. One of their sources, Wallace's mother Mary Pell Sampson (Jackie Welch), is reluctant to talk to them, and Matt begs Delana to help him in speaking to the woman. Delana reluctantly agrees, not for Matt, but because she dislikes someone getting away with murder. Mary Pell tells Delana that 'The Store' was firebombed because it was a front for prostitution. The publisher discovers that Matt and Bullock are continuing to work on the story against his orders. After a public confrontation in which Matt challenges the publisher, Matt seeks his father's help. Using his father's advice, Matt and Bullock subvert the publisher and renew the investigation. They ask Delana to help with the interview of Wallace's girlfriend Vanessa (Maisha Dyson), and Delana again becomes part of the team. Vanessa reveals a crucial clue about someone running from the scene. Matt and Bullock discover that Judge Buchanan (Tommy Cresswell) owned the store that was firebombed. Somebody in a car tries to run Delana off the road when she leaves Amos, but she escapes. Matt realizes how much Delana means to him and rushes to comfort her. He delivers a full and complete apology for his self-centered behavior. Matt and Bullock track down the man running from the scene, Billy ‚ÄòPossum‚Äô Baker (Clay Brocker). They learn he's been an anti-Klan informer and is still undercover. Baker is now dying, and he is no longer worried about the consequences of coming forward with the truth. Just as they publish the story, Matt's father dies. Matt arrives in time to make his peace and to hear the words of approval he's always craved. When Matt has to choose between doing the right thing and doing the professional thing, he makes the right choice, and Delana falls back in love with him. Matt and Bullock's story leads to indictments. Evidence proves the same gun that killed Wallace Sampson also killed the police chief. The reporters foil an attempt on Possum's life the night before a hearing where everything is made clear and Mary Pell reveals a final shocking truth about the killer that leaves everyone gasping. The reporters receive a prize for investigative reporting. The town of Amos is transformed. Matt Harper has become a reporter with a conscience and someone who finally deserves Delana.

Aside from her affiliation with the UFW, she was a second-generation Chicana with a traditional upbringing and limited education. Early life Helen Fabela was born on January 21, 1928, in Brawley, California. She was a first generation Mexican-American. Her mother was from Sombrerete, Mexico, and her father from San Jacinto, Mexico. Both her parents immigrated to the USA separately after the Mexican Revolution, and eventually married in Los Angeles, California, in 1948.Traditional and Nontraditional Patterns of Female Activism in the United Farm Workers of America, 1962 to 1980 by Margaret Rose Both worked as migrant laborers, first in the Imperial Valley and later in the San Joaqu√≠n Valley and thus exposed her to the hardships of labor at an early age. She began working in the fields herself at age seven. After her father's death, when Helen was fifteen, she left high school to support her family which consisted of her mother, two sisters, and four brothers of whom she was the eldest.http://www.jrank.org/cultures/pages/3706/Helen-Ch√°vez.html Helen worked in a grocery store and eventually made her way to working in the fields and vineyards full-time.  Married life  Fabela met C√©sar Ch√°vez in 1942 while she was still a student at Delano High School in California. Soon after his World War II service in the United States Navy ended, in 1945, he began spending more time with her. Helen Fabela Chavez, Farm Activist‚Äôs Widow and Union Partner, Dies at the age of 88 The New York Times, June 12, 2016 They dated \\"inexpensively ‚Äî a walk in the moonlight or perhaps a movie.\\" The couple was married in a civil ceremony on October 22, 1948, in Reno, Nevada. At the time, she was 20 years old. Then the two returned to San Jose, California for a church wedding. They departed for a two-week honeymoon before settling into their new lives together. Although she was trying to start her own family, she remained the main source of income for her siblings and parents. The newlyweds settled permanently in Delano, California. Over the next decade, the two grew to a family of ten with the total addition of eight children (Fernando, Sylvia, Linda, Eloise, Liz, Paul, Anna, and Anthony) and a later total of 31 grandchildren.  Union organizing  Due to her father's involvement in the Mexican Revolution, Helen Ch√°vez was influenced from a young age to be involved in political activism. She held the more 'traditional' role usually reserved for women. The traditional model for union organizing for women included the ability to \\"juggle the competing demands of family life, sexual division of labor, and protest in a unique blend of union activism.\\" Helen and C√©sar soon became involved in labor organizing. By networking with their local Catholic priest, his name was passed to Fred Ross, an organizer of the Community Service Organization (CSO). C√©sar initially refused to work with Ross due to his Anglo background, but Helen persuaded him to eventually become a full-time CSO organizer. He became the National Director of the CSO in 1958. Dual commitments Due to Helen Ch√°vez's emphasis on home life as both a mother and a wife, the majority of credit for the labor movement went to her husband. Unlike female labor activists of the time, such as Dolores Huerta, her activities were considered \\"essentially auxiliary; she helped in the office, mimeographing fliers or sorting the mail, but usually worked at home after her domestic chores were done and the children were asleep\\". Her involvement in CSO activities is often overshadowed by her husband's political involvement, although, \\"the voluntarism of Helen Ch√°vez and other women behind the scenes made the CSO one of the most successful associations for Mexican Americans in California during that time\\". Not only caring for and raising her eight children, she also worked tirelessly ten hours a day supporting her family. Between family and work, she dedicated all of her spare time to assisting with CSO business. She also taught literacy classes for migrant workers during voting drives and later assisted them in gaining US citizenship. She was also in charge of handwriting the CSO daily reports that her husband dictated (CSO). Later involvements C√©sar Ch√°vez resigned from the CSO in 1962 to start the Farm Workers Association, later known as the National Farm Workers Association, thus moving the family back to Delano. While he was building the new union, Helen Ch√°vez picked up a job working in a field picking grapes for less than $2.00 per day. The NFWA soon voted her to a full-time position as an administrator of the credit union, a position she was not keen to take due her lack of skills. She quickly learned book keeping and remained a financial record keeper for the association for more than 20 years. In 1965, the NFWA merged with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) to become the United Farm Workers Organization Committee (UFWOC). C√©sar and Helen Ch√°vez's efforts became known as La Causa (the Cause). Using nonviolent alternatives for change such as protests, strikes, boycotts, pickets, fasts and marches, the UFWOC fought for fair labor practices. She was involved in the demand for union recognition during all demonstrations and was arrested in 1966 for shouting Huelga! (\\"Strike!\\") at the W. B. Camp ranch. Accomplishments Ch√°vez mostly maintained the traditional role of a woman involved in such movements by assisting in the administrative parts of the process and by staying out of the public eye. Her most public moments were her \\"four arrests, two of which were widely reported\\" and although her \\"acts of civil disobedience have been few, her example has encouraged other Mexicanas and Chicanas to undergo arrest\\" for the sake of the greater good. Ch√°vez challenged the role of women in the activist movement and provided a template for other Hispanic women who may eventually join the union efforts. Ch√°vez's personal experience of the hardships of working the fields made her an invaluable part of the spirit of the movement. Her involvement and passion for the cause became a huge motivator for other Latinos to join the union efforts. In 1974, news of her efforts spread as far as Europe. It was in 1994, a year after her husband's death, that she accepted the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in her husband's honor. Due to the existing sexual division of labor in the union and systemic sexism in society, few women have been recognized for their contributions to labor movements. She still remained invisible ‚Äî unrecognized and unappreciated by union members and supporters. In 2008 Helen Ch√°vez was awarded Latina of the Year by the National Latino Peace Officers Association of Los Angeles Chapter. Helen Ch√°vez was played by America Ferrera in Diego Luna's Cesar Chavez. Death On June 6, 2016, Ch√°vez died at a Bakersfield hospital at the age of 88. She had earlier been fighting an unspecified infection. Ch√°vez is buried in Keene, California alongside her husband. https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/local/2016/06/07/helen-fabela- chavez-wife-cesar-chavez-dead/85579118/ https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/local/2016/06/07/helen-fabela- chavez-wife-cesar-chavez-dead/85579118/ References External links *http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art34399.asp *http://www.freedomtomarry.org/blog/entry/voice-for-equality-helen-chavez Category:1928 births Category:2016 deaths Category:American women trade unionists Category:People from Brawley, California Category:Cesar Chavez Category:United Farm Workers people Category:American trade unionists of Mexican descent Category:Activists for Hispanic and Latino American civil rights Category:Trade unionists from California ","title":"Helen Fabela Ch√°vez"},{"id":"33651094","text":"Red 2 is 2013 American action comedy film and sequel to the 2010 film Red. It was based on the limited comic book series of the same name, created by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, and published by the DC Comics imprint Homage. The film stars Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Lee Byung-hun, Anthony Hopkins, and Helen Mirren, with Dean Parisot directing a screenplay by Jon and Erich Hoeber. Red 2 was released on July 19, 2013. Plot Three years after the events of the previous film, ex-CIA operative Frank Moses tries to lead a normal life with girlfriend Sarah Ross. He dismisses Marvin Boggs‚Äô claims that enemies are still after them; Marvin drives off and his car explodes. Although Frank is unconvinced Marvin is dead, Sarah convinces him to attend Marvin's funeral where he delivers a tearful eulogy. Government agents interrogate Frank at an FBI Yankee White facility. Corrupt agent Jack Horton and a team of private military contractors ambush the facility; he threatens to torture Sarah until Frank gives him the information he needs. Frank evades Horton, and with the help of the still living Marvin, goes on the run with Sarah. Marvin explains he and Frank have been targeted as members of Operation Nightshade, a clandestine operation during the Cold War to smuggle a nuclear weapon into Russia. Horton convinces international agencies that Frank and his associates are terrorists on the run. Frank‚Äôs old ally Victoria notifies him that she has been contracted by MI6 to kill the fugitives. Another top contract killer, Han Cho-Bai, is also hired, seeking revenge against Frank. Frank, Marvin, and Sarah steal Han's plane and fly to Paris to find \\"The Frog\\", with the Americans and Han in pursuit. They are met by Katja Petrokovich, a Russian secret agent with whom Frank had a relationship, who is also investigating Nightshade. They interrogate the Frog and Sarah, hoping to one-up Katja, seduces him. The Frog gives them the key to his security box, which Katja takes after drugging Frank; Marvin, anticipating her double-cross, provided Frank with a similar key to give her. Marvin, Frank, and Sarah search the box themselves and find documents pointing to physicist Dr. Edward Bailey as the creator of the Nightshade bomb. They discover Bailey is alive, held for thirty-two years in a maximum security asylum for the criminally insane in London. Victoria, alerted by Marvin, ambushes the trio, but helps fake their deaths and infiltrate the asylum. They find the hyperactive Bailey, incapacitated by mind-fogging drugs, and bring him to Marvin‚Äôs safehouse, where Bailey remembers the location of the bomb. In Moscow, Bailey concludes he hid the bomb in the Kremlin. There, the team locates the suitcase bomb, powered by red mercury. Katja stops them, but Frank persuades her to join their mission. They escape, but a call from Victoria, who has broken out of MI6 confinement for failing to kill him, reveals that Bailey was imprisoned because he wanted to detonate the bomb. Holding Frank at gunpoint, Bailey confirms Victoria's message, admitting he made a deal to give Horton the bomb. He shoots Katja, frames Frank, and leaves with the bomb. Horton reneges on their deal, intending to torture Bailey for all his secrets, but Bailey deploys a nerve gas inside the plane, killing Davis, Horton's colleague, and all of the soldiers with Davis and Horton. Bailey, however, administers the antidote to Horton so that he can witness Bailey's plan, and escapes to the Iranian embassy in London. In pursuit, Frank is attacked by Han. Reaching a standoff, Frank urges Han to join him in stopping Bailey; Han relents, and the five enact a plan to recapture the bomb. Sarah seduces the Iranian ambassador and takes him hostage. Marvin poses as a potential defector, causing a diversion in the embassy that allows the team to enter disguised as plumbers. They learn the bomb‚Äôs location, but Bailey has already triggered the timer and killed Horton. Bailey takes Sarah hostage and flees to Han‚Äôs plane to escape the imminent explosion. Frank, Marvin, Victoria, and Han give chase, but Marvin‚Äôs attempts to disarm the suitcase bomb cause the timer to count down even faster. Frank boards the plane and confronts Bailey with the suitcase; he forces Frank to leave with Sarah and the suitcase. They rejoin the others and wait for the suitcase to detonate as the plane takes off ‚Äì high in the sky, it explodes. Frank reveals that he hid the bomb aboard the plane and confronted Bailey with the empty case. Han angrily demands $30 million for his plane and $20 million for not killing Frank. The film ends as Sarah enjoys herself on a mission in Caracas with Frank and Marvin.

In January 2011, Summit Entertainment rehired writers Jon and Erich Hoeber to write a second installment of Red due to the film's financial success, which even surpassed producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura's expectations. Helen Mirren stated in March 2011 that she was ready for Red 2. In October 2011, Summit announced that Red 2 would be released on August 2, 2013 and the film would \\"reunite the team of retired CIA operatives with some new friends as they use their 'old-school style' to take on new enemies in Europe.\\" In February 2012, Dean Parisot, best known for directing Galaxy Quest and Fun With Dick and Jane, entered final negotiations to direct the sequel. In May 2012, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lee Byung-hun signed on to join the cast of Red 2. Also in May, it was reported that Anthony Hopkins was up to appear in the film as the villain, Edward Bailey, if a scheduling conflict could be worked out with Thor: The Dark World. In July 2012, Neal McDonough entered negotiations to join the cast of Red 2. In August 2012, it was announced that Red 2 would film in Montreal beginning in September. The city was selected because of a 25 percent tax credit offered by the province of Quebec and because of its resemblance to European cities (the film's settings include London, Paris and Moscow). It was also reported that following the Montreal shoot, the production would film in London even though Montreal doubled for London in some scenes. In September 2012, David Thewlis joined the cast as a character called The Frog, an information dealer who got his name by poisoning the water supply at the Kremlin using a poisonous Amazonian frog. Principal photography began in late September in Montreal. In March 2013, Summit moved the film's release date from August 2, 2013 to July 19, 2013.

Lee's father was a fan of Hollywood films and dreamed of being an actor himself. When Lee shared this story with Dean Parisot, the director, he was so touched that he decided to include Lee's father at the end credits as one of the main cast, even though the photos appear only briefly in the film. Reception =Box office= Red 2 opened on July 19, 2013, in North America. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $18.5 million and finished in fifth place, which was lower than the $21.8 million its predecessor earned in October 2010. According to exit polling, 67% of the audience was over 35 and 52% was male. Red 2 grossed $53.3 million in North America and $94.8 million overseas for a total of $148.1 million worldwide. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 44% based on 148 reviews, with an average rating of 5.44/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"While it's still hard to argue with its impeccable cast or the fun they often seem to be having, Red 2 replaces much of the goofy fun of its predecessor with empty, over-the-top bombast.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted mean, assigned a score of 47 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Justin Chang of Variety called Red 2, \\"An obligatory sequel that can't quite recapture the sly, laid-back pleasures of its cheerfully ridiculous predecessor.\\" Todd Gilchrist of The Wrap said, \\"...in a lackadaisical sequel no one asked for except perhaps his creditors, Bruce Willis seems unmotivated to smile at all, much less offer a series of emotions that constitute a believable or compelling performance.\\" Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"Not that it isn‚Äôt entertaining, but the film's premise is certainly well past its 'use by' date, resulting in another passably palatable sequel distinguished by a lack of narrative and stylistic coherence that could potentially underpin a really viable franchise.\\" Betsy Sharkey of Los Angeles Times said, \\"No doubt the hope was that Dean Parisot could do to the action genre what he did to the Star Trek universe in the spot-on satire of 1999's Galaxy Quest. He has, and he hasn't. Red 2 is much more of a mixed bag than it should have been.\\" Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times said, \\"Cars careen, lazily written infiltration plans are executed, and the violence is plentiful and toothless.\\" Future In May 2013, Lionsgate re-signed Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber to write a third installment.'Red 3' in the Works at Summit (Exclusive).

OmniTouch is a wearable computer, depth-sensing camera and projection system that enables interactive multitouch interfaces on everyday surface. Beyond the shoulder-worn system, there is no instrumentation of the user or the environment. For example, the present shoulder-worn implementation allows users to manipulate interfaces projected onto the environment (e.g., walls, tables), held objects (e.g., notepads, books), and their own bodies (e.g., hands, lap). On such surfaces - without any calibration - OmniTouch provides capabilities similar to that of a touchscreen: X and Y location in 2D interfaces and whether fingers are ‚Äúclicked‚Äù or hovering. This enables a wide variety of applications, similar to what one might find on a modern smartphone. A user study assessing pointing accuracy of the system (user and system inaccuracies combined) suggested buttons needed to be in diameter to achieve reliable operation on the hand, on walls. This is approaching the accuracy of capacitive touchscreens, like those found in smart phones, but on arbitrary surfaces. OmniTouch was developed by researchers Chris Harrison, Hrvoje Benko and Andy Wilson at Microsoft Research in 2011. The work was accepted to and presented at the 2011 ACM User Interface and Software Technology conference. Many major news outlets and online tech blogs covered the technology. It is conceptually similar to efforts such as Skinput and SixthSense. A central contribution of the work was a novel depth-driven, fuzzy template matching approach to finger tracking and click registration. The system also finds and tracks surfaces suitable for projection, on which interactive applications can be projected.

The Nazi regime oversaw Germany's rise as a militarist world power from the state of humiliation and disempowerment it had experienced following its defeat in World War I. From the late 1930s to its defeat in 1945, Germany was the most formidable of the Axis powers - a military alliance between Imperial Japan, Fascist Italy, and their allies and puppet states.  History  Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany succumbed to a considerably weakened position in pan-European politics, losing its colonial possessions and its military assets, and committed to reparations to the Allied Powers. These concessions to the Allied Powers led to a great feeling of disillusionment within the newly established Weimar Republic which paved the way for the Nazi party, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler to seize power. Upon Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Germany began a program of industrialization and rearmament. It re-occupied the Rhineland and sought to dominate neighboring countries with significant German populations.

Reza Shah Pahlavi, the second-last Shah of Iran harbored pro-Nazi sympathies, but Nazi Germany was unable to prevent Britain and Soviet Russia from taking control of his regime and overthrowing him in 1941. = India = As part of their campaign to weaken the British Empire, Nazi Germany expressed support for hardline Indian revolutionaries seeking India's independence. Although the Indian National Congress and other Indian political organizations opposed Nazi Germany or preserved neutrality, revolutionaries under Subhas Chandra Bose openly sought Germany's backing.

With German and Japanese backing, Bose formed the Provisional Government of Free India and the Indian National Army to fight British forces occupying India.

Charri√®re was born in Cerniat, in the Canton of Fribourg, Switzerland. He moved to Paris at age 13, and was apprenticed to a manufacturer of knives. In 1820 he founded a company manufacturing surgical instruments, which quickly grew to 400 employees by around 1840, and was world-famous by his death. He became a naturalized French citizen in 1843. He developed and improved a number of instruments, especially hypodermic needles and catheters; the French catheter scale is named after his work. Several of his apprentices also became well-known instrument makers, including Georges- Guillaume-Amatus L√ºer, Louis-Joseph Mathieu, and Adolphe Collin in Paris; Josef Leiter in Vienna; and Camillus Nyrop in Copenhagen. He was inducted into the Legion of Honour in 1851, and died in 1876 in Paris.  Measuring unit  His name is used as a measuring unit for the outer diameter and the general size of urological instruments, endoscopes and catheters for a various purposes (1 Charri√®re = 1 mm outer circumference ~ 1/3 mm outer diameter). In English-speaking countries, the name \\"Charri√®re\\" was found difficult to pronounce. Thus, the term \\"French\\" was rapidly adopted in its stead. This is now generally used as a measuring unit for medical catheters and introducers (1 French = 1/3 mm).

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies in and . Professional career =Los Angeles Dodgers= Martin was drafted in the 1st round of the 2008 MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He began his career with the Great Lakes Loons in 2009, when he was 6-8 with a 3.87 ERA in 27 games (19 starts). In 2010 with the Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino he was 9-14 with a 6.35 ERA in 25 appearances (22 starts). He began 2011 in the starting rotation for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes but was moved to the bullpen in midseason and then promoted to Double-A with the Chattanooga Lookouts. Combined he was 9-7 with a 5.95 ERA in 37 appearances (12 starts) in 2011. In 2012 with the Lookouts, he was 8-6 with a 3.58 ERA and selected to the mid-season Southern League all-star team. =Philadelphia Phillies= On July 31, 2012, the Dodgers traded Martin to the Philadelphia Phillies along with fellow right-handed pitcher Josh Lindblom for outfielder Shane Victorino. After being the \\"workhorse\\" of the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs, Martin was called up to the major leagues to make his debut against the Atlanta Braves on August 2, 2013. He allowed 6 runs in 4 1/3 innings to take the loss in his debut. Martin earned his first Major League victory on August 8, 2013 with a 12-1 victory over the Cubs. He allowed one run over 5 innings. After seven starts in which he amassed a 2‚Äì4 record with a 6.90 ERA, Martin was sent to the bullpen. At that time, Phillies veteran pitcher Roy Halladay gave him a baseball card that showed the 2000 season in which Halladay posted a 10.64 ERA, encouraging Martin to understand even the best pitchers have rough spots. Entering spring training in 2014, Martin was in major league camp, and was expected to compete for a spot on the major league roster, either as a starter or a reliever. However, he left his first spring training appearance due to discomfort in his throwing shoulder. While his fastball averaged in 2013, it reached only during the appearance. He was outrighted off the 40-man roster on June 29, 2015. On December 11, 2015 Martin signed with the Braves, but he was released on March 29, 2016. He has not pitched professionally since.

He earned the nickname Klepto Kitty after bringing home more than 600 items from the gardens he prowled at night. His owners say his record theft is eleven items in one spree. He has been caught on camera carrying home a bra. Early years  Born on March 20, 2006, Dusty is a Snowshoe cat who lives in San Mateo, California, United States. He was adopted from the Peninsula Humane Society by Jean Chu and Jim Coleman. His first two years of life were uneventful, but in 2008, his owners began to notice household objects that did not belong to them appearing in strange places, and they began to suspect that their cat was bringing them home, a suspicion that they were eventually able to confirm.  Notoriety  Although his thievery began in 2008, Dusty didn't really receive notoriety outside of his neighborhood until the Animal Planet show Must Love Cats aired a profile of him in February 2011. The \\"Must Love Cats\\" crew was able to set up a motion-triggered night vision camera and catch Dusty in the act of bringing home his spoils. The Animal Planet report led to a February 14, 2011, story by Vic Lee of KGO-TV of San Francisco, and Dusty's appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman on February 22, 2011. Cultural relevance Since his appearances on Letterman and other national news outlets, Dusty has become a minor national and international celebrity. He has appeared at many community events in the San Francisco Bay Area and has made appearances on many national and international news outlets. He served as the Grand Marshal of the Redwood City Pet Parade in May 2011, and appeared at a fundraiser for the Peninsula Humane Society in June 2011. Because of the kitty-cam footage for the Animal Planet documentary, Dusty's behavior became a bonus feature in a three-minute short on the DVD release for the 2011 movie Puss in Boots. It is entitled \\"Klepto Kitty\\". Because Dusty was an adoptee from the Peninsula Humane Society animal shelter, he made a celebrity appearance at their annual adopt-a-thon in June, 2011. Some of his unclaimed stolen items were displayed and sold. To keep his fans up to date with his finds, his owners maintain his Facebook page and provide pictures of the items that Dusty brings home.

These behavioral changes are reversed with small lesions in hypothalamus. The term sham rage was in use by Walter Bradford Cannon and Sydney William Britton as early as 1925. Cannon and Britton did research on emotional expression resulting from action of subcortical areas. Cats had their neocortices removed but still displayed characteristics of extreme anger resulting from mild stimuli. The concept has been rejected by many affective neuroscientists on the grounds that nonhuman animals displaying rage behaviors do indeed experience rage. This is the view of Jaak Panksepp, for example, who was among the first to describe the neural generators of rage. Symptoms The physiological symptoms of sham rage include rise in blood sugar, pulse, respiratory rates, and blood pressure. These symptoms can occur spontaneously and may also be evoked by sensory stimulations. In some cases animals have suffered several convulsive attacks followed by withdrawal of sodium barbital. It has been concluded that the cerebral cortex may play a facilitating part in this type of convulsive process. These physiological effects happen alongside the rage-like symptoms of hissing, clawing, biting, etc. Causes There are only a few known causes of sham rage in animals. Most of the experiments done on animals have been done on cats, dogs and rats. The actual symptoms of sham rage are normal anger and defense reactions in animals. It becomes sham rage only when this rage reaction is triggered by unthreatening stimuli. A study by Bard (1934) showed that the removal of the neocortex in cats and dogs produced sham rage. The behavior of each animal was observed before the surgery was performed, noting how calm and friendly the animal was with humans and other animals, as well as their reactions to being handled. After the surgery, Bard observed that the animals would have an extreme rage reaction to stimuli that had previously produced little to no response, like touching the tail. He concluded the reason for this might be that the removal of the neocortex causes a loss of inhibition of the areas involved in the rage reaction, causing those areas to become hyperactive. A study by Reis and Gunne (1965) found that electrically stimulating the amygdala of cats caused sham rage, which resulted in a decrease in the presence of adrenaline and noradrenaline. They believed this was because the excited defense reaction known as sham rage caused such a huge increase in the release of the neurotransmitters that the brain could not resynthesize noradrenaline fast enough to keep up. Reis and Fuxe (1969) then did a study of cats that went into a sham rage after having a brainstem transection. The purpose was to determine the relationship between the decrease in norepinephrine in sham rage and the magnitude of the sham rage behavior. They found that a more extreme sham rage was correlated with lower levels of norepinephrine. They also found that when they gave these cats protriptyline, which facilitates the actions of norepinephrine, their symptoms got worse and when they gave them haloperidol, which inhibits the functions of norepinephrine, their symptoms were less severe. They concluded that this meant the release of norepinephrine is necessary for sham rage behavior. Prevalence in humans In some cases, human sham rage appears to be caused by \\"uninhibited hypothalamic discharge\\". This is not surprising, as the role of the hypothalamus in generating the internal experience of rage has been mapped in rats, cats, and humans. Three known causes of hypothalamic discharge are depolarization of the hypothalamus via electrode stimulation, carbon monoxide poisoning and insulin hypoglycemia. While experiencing sham rage, the human body will show both internal and external signs of physical distress. Bouts of sham rage are never intentional in humans, but the body will show \\"changes in the internal organs and in the composition of the blood similar to those characteristic of human emotional behavior\\". Although a person will express emotion during moments of sham rage, it does not indicate that the individual is actually feeling that emotion. However, there is no reason to suspect that the individual is not actually feeling the emotion, and the concept of sham rage, i.e., the expression of rage behaviors during increased activation in the hypothalamus in the absence of the internal experience of rage, is likely a false concept, and an artifact of the politics of the period of science during which the concept was created. Stimuli encountered by a human during an outburst can cause physical reactions such as pupil dilation, exophthalmos, increased pulse rate, an increase in systolic pressure, and widening of the palpebral fissures.

McDonald, M. Harmon and C.C. Blanch to mine the borate deposits that Daunet discovered there in 1880. The partnership established the first borax works in the valley. Partly refined borax was hauled to Daggett, California through the Panamint Valley using 12-mule teams hauling two wagons. The extraction business operated until 1884 when problems mounted and Daunet took his own life. The property eventually passed to the U.S. Borax Company, which kept it as a mining reserve, then to Borax Consolidated, Ltd. in 1922. The property was sold to the Death Valley Hotel Company in 1956, and finally to the National Park Service. Little remains of the structures but ruins. The works originally included a boiler, a tank for dissolved borax, and open tanks for crystallization of the borax. A stone building stood nearby to house the workers. The boiler fire box remains, along with an earth mound at the site of the building. Isidore Daunet Isidore Daunet (1850‚Äì1884) was a French emigrant to the United States, who arrived at the age of ten, coming to San Francisco and becoming a prospector at the age of 13. Daunet discovered the borax deposit during a disastrous 1880 crossing of Death Valley, in which three of his companions died, and Daunet survived only by killing one of the party's animals and drinking its blood. After establishing the borax company in 1882, he fell into business trouble. His wife gave notice of her intention to divorce him, and Daunet was swindled out of $11,000. He committed suicide in May 1884. The site of the borax works was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 1974. The site is within Death Valley National Park.

Furthermore, several churches contain works still to be discovered. La Grande Chapelle is one of the groups researching in that field. Composers of several European countries and the formal founder √Ångel Recasens created the group in 2005. The diversity of musicians encourages the unity of various musical techniques and schools. The main objective of La Grande Chapelle is to recover musical treasures, a legacy from the 16th century until the beginning of the 21st century. Another objective of the association is to perform early repertory at festivals, such as the Festival Internacional Cervantino where the vocal ensemble presented music from the 16th century, including Tom√°s Luis de Victoria's Mass Salve Regina (1592), and pieces dedicated to the Virgin Mary. La Grande Chapelle has performed at different important festivals in Spain and France, such as the ones in Picardie and Haut-Jura, and Musica Sacra Maastricht, OsterKlang-Festival and at La Cit√© de la Musique in Paris. The ensemble has performed in Belgium, France, Hungary, Mexico, Canada, Japan and China. Their repertory includes antiphons and motets, the psalm Nisi Dominus and the Magnificat primi toni. They also perform the Missa pro Defunctis by Mateo Romero, Music for the Corpus of Joan Pau Pujol, and the mass O Gloriosa Virginum by Antonio Rodr√≠guez de Hita. The director Albert Recasens promoted the creation of the recording label Lauda in 2005. This company has released records focused to the exploration of the relationship between music and literature of the Golden Century. La Grande Chapelle‚Äôs recordings under this label have been recognized by the Orph√©e d¬¥Or, besides being called the label of the year by the Prelude Classical Music Awards of 2007 in the Netherlands.

The frequent moves forced him to repeat a grade early in elementary school. While Lee finished sixth grade, his grandfather died and his grandmother moved to the housing projects in Baldwin Village, Los Angeles; Lee and his younger sister chose not to move with her and instead became wards of the state. His two older brothers were involved in gangs: one, Terreal Reid, was murdered in a gang-related killing and the other, Donte Reid, was imprisoned in Arizona on a count of attempted murder.

The bridge was widened in 1890 by the addition of a third line of truss on new piers on the upstream side to carry horse trams. In 1915 the bridge was further strengthened to accommodate the extra weight of electric trams and widened to accommodate two cantilever footpaths. Further widening and reconditioning of the bridge took place in 1933, including the addition of four new welded trusses. The bridge is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The bridge initiated travel and trade between the industrial inner suburbs and the eastern suburbs of Melbourne and stands testimony to the development of the tramway in the city. It comprises two Ornamental Tramway Overhead Gantries which were installed in 1916.

The grito‚Äîa joyous Mexican shout‚Äîopens the festivities every year. This festival is a shared heritage celebration between the two border cities of Brownsville, Texas and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. The Charro Days festivals usually have about 50,000 attendees each year. This celebration includes the Sombrero Festival as well as a parade that goes down Elizabeth St. through Historic Downtown Brownsville, TX. History The festival was first organized and celebrated 1937 by the Brownsville Chamber of Commerce to recognize Mexican culture and honor the charros, or the \\"dashing Mexican gentlemen cowboys.\\" In addition, it is mentioned in the official webpage that the Charro Days festival was also created to bring people together during the effects of the Great Depression. Although not proven, it is rumored that the first ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù Charro Days was realized in the early to mid-1800s, when people from the city of Brownsville, Texas, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas, just across the Rio Grande in Mexico, came together to celebrate a cooperative cultural festival to honor the two nations. Traditions The four-day festival has daily parades, food stands and music, people dancing in the street, boat races, fireworks, bull fights, and a rodeo in Brownsville and in its sister city of Matamoros. =Costumes= Costumes reflecting Mexico's tradition have been used by those who partake in the occasion. Men, for the most part, wear traditional Mexican costumes‚Äîwhether it is the charro costume or a cowboy one‚Äîwhile women wear the colorful Huipil costume. The traditional costume is often worn by adults, elders, and children on all four days to celebrate and honor borderland heroes. =Events= Mr. Amigo Association, an organization that works for the friendly relationship with Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico and Brownsville, Texas, United States and to preserve the Charro Days and Sombrero Festival celebrations, became a part of Charro Days in 1967. Sombrero Fest, a three-day Washington Park street party with popular rock, country and Tejano performers, was added in 1986. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the first president of the Mr. Amigo Association was the former president of Mexico, Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s. During the creation of NAFTA agreement in 1988-1989, Congressman Solomon Ortiz presented the Mr. Amigo Association with the Mr. Amigo Review Award for the distinction of being one of the first organizations to extend friendship and mutual understanding between the United States and Mexico. The Mr. Amigo Review Award remains on exhibit at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. as a model of bi- national friendliness between these two countries.

Sarnath Museum. The Lion Capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four Asiatic lions standing back to back, on an elaborate base that includes other animals. A graphic representation of it was adopted as the official Emblem of India in 1950.State Emblem, Know India india.gov.in It was originally placed on the top of the Ashoka pillar at the important Buddhist site of Sarnath by the Emperor Ashoka, in about 250 BCE. The pillar, sometimes called the A≈õoka Column, is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the Sarnath Museum, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Standing 2.15 metres (7 feet) high including the base, it is more elaborate than the other very similar surviving capitals of the pillars of Ashoka bearing the Edicts of Ashoka that were placed throughout India several of which feature single animals at the top; one other damaged group of four lions survives, at Sanchi.Harle, 24 The capital is carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, and was always a separate piece from the column itself. It features four Asiatic Lions standing back to back. They are mounted on an abacus with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion, separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels. The whole sits upon a bell-shaped lotus. The capital was originally crowned by a 'Wheel of Dharma' (Dharmachakra popularly known in India as the \\"Ashoka Chakra\\"), with 32 spokes, of which a few fragments were found on the site.Allen, caption at start of Chapter 15 A 13th-century replica of the Sarnath pillar and capital in Wat Umong near Chiang Mai, Thailand built by King Mangrai, preserves its crowning Ashoka Chakra or Dharmachakra. The wheel on the capital, below the lions, is the model for the one in the flag of India. Art history The horse motif on the capital. Currently seven animal sculptures from Ashoka pillars survive. These form \\"the first important group of Indian stone sculpture\\", though it is thought they derive from an existing tradition of wooden columns topped by animal sculptures in copper, none of which have survived. There has been much discussion of the extent of influence from Achaemenid Persia, where the column capitals supporting the roofs at Persepolis have similarities, and the \\"rather cold, hieratic style\\" of the Sarnath sculptures especially shows \\"obvious Achaemenid and Sargonid influence\\".Harle, 22, 24, quoted in turn; Companion, 429-430 Very similar four, lion sculptures are on the capitals of the two columns supporting the south torana of the Ashokan or Satavahana enclosure wall round the Great Stupa at Sanchi. Like other Ashoka pillars, the one at Sarnath was probably erected to commemorate a visit by the emperor. Rediscovery The Lion Capital on the ground at Sarnath, probably 1904‚Äì05 Ashok Stambha replica, Wat Umong, Thailand, 13th century There was no surviving traces above ground of the Sarnath pillar, mentioned in the accounts of medieval Chinese pilgrims, when the Indian Civil Service engineer F. O. Oertel, with no real experience in archaeology, was allowed to excavate there in the winter of 1904‚Äì05. He first uncovered the remains of a Gupta shrine west of the main stupa, overlying an Ashokan structure. To the west of that he found the lowest section of the pillar, upright but broken off near ground level. Most of the rest of the pillar was found in three sections nearby, and then, since the Sanchi capital had been excavated in 1851, the search for an equivalent was continued, and it was found close by. It was both finer in execution and in much better condition than that at Sanchi. The pillar appeared to have been deliberately destroyed at some point. The finds were recognised as so important that the first onsite museum in India (and one of the few then in the world) was set up to house them.Allen, Chapter 15 The Lion Capital served as the pedestal of a large stone Dharma-chakra with 32 spokes, which was found broken into pieces.Vasudeva S. Agrawala (March 1964), \\"The Heritage of Indian Art: A Pictorial Presentation\\". Publications Division Ministry of Information & Broadcasting This Dharma-chakra was intended by three Constituent Assembly to be the symbol of India. However, mistakenly the smaller dhakrachakra with 24 spokes became the symbol. The mistake was pointed out to Jawaharlal Nehru, by Radha Kumud Mukherjee, historian, scholar and Rajya Sabha Member during Jawaharlal Nehru's administration; however, Nehru decided to stick with the 24-spoke wheel.Dola Mitra (18 January 2016). \\"32 Spokes Of Wisdom\\".

A group of four lions joined back to back symbolizes a group of four things of equal importance. The lion is frequently used as a symbol of the Buddha, as at Sanchi, and the animals on the abacus below also have symbolic meaning in Buddhism. The capital is clearly Buddhist and Mauryan in origin and thus probably symbolizes the spread of Dharma, and perhaps the extent of the Maurya Empire in all directions, or four parts of the empire. Alternatively, the group of four lions and bell jointly symbolize preaching of 'the Four Noble Truths' of Buddhism to all; those that emphasize the Middle Path. The symbol U with a vertical line placed symmetrically inside it symbolizes 'The Middle Path'. The Middle Path is the fundamental philosophy of Buddhism, the Buddhist Dharma. National Emblem of India A further clue could be the cylindrical portion of the Lion Capital. On the wall of the cylinder the bull, the horse, the Lion and the Elephant all in the moving position are being placed in between the Chakras. These could symbolize Bull, Lion, Horse and Elephant rolling the Chakras. A study of the ancient coins and other archaeological finds of India and Sri Lanka reveals the fact that Buddha had been symbolized with a Horse, Lion, Bull, Elephant and a pair of feet. The Tamil epic Manimekalai mentions worship of a pair of feet. Pairs of feet made of stone had been discovered in Jaffna Peninsula, Anuradhapura and in a number of places of Tamil Nadu.In a number of Buddhist inscriptions of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, a pair of feet had been symbolized with a pair of fish or a pair of conch shells. In this way the symbols sculpted in the cylindrical portion of the Lion Capital represents Buddha rolling the Dhamma Chakra; that is, Preaching the Dhamma. As Theravada Buddhism rejects symbolization of Buddha and Buddhism, the Lion Capital may be claimed as one of the finest sculptures of the main tradition that developed into Mahayana Buddhism several centuries later.

A pillar of finely polished sandstone, one of the Pillars of Ashoka, was also erected on the side of the main Torana gateway at Sanchi. The bell-shaped capital consists of four lions, which probably supported a Wheel of Law.Buddhist Architecture by Huu Phuoc Le p.155 The capital is located at the nearby Sanchi Archaeological Museum. The capital is rather similar to the Sarnath capital, except that it is surmounted by an abacus and a crowning ornament of four lions, set back to back, the whole finely finished and polished to a remarkable luster from top to bottom. The abacus is adorned with four flame palmette designs separated one from the other by pairs of geese, symbolical perhaps of the flock of the Buddha's disciples. The lions from the summit, though now quite disfigured, still testify to the skills of the sculptors.Marshall, \\"A Guide to Sanchi\\" p.90ff Public Domain text  Notes   References  *Allen, Charles, Ashoka: The Search for India's Lost Emperor, 2012, Hachette UK, , 9781408703885, google books *\\"Companion\\": Brown, Rebecca M., Hutton, Deborah S., eds., A Companion to Asian Art and Architecture, Volume 3 of Blackwell companions to art history, 2011, John Wiley & Sons, 2011, , 9781444396324, google books *Harle, J.C., The Art and Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent, 2nd edn. 1994, Yale University Press Pelican History of Art,  External links  *Blog with excellent photos *For Pictures of the famous original \\"Lion Capital of Ashoka\\" preserved at the Sarnath Museum which has been adopted as the \\"National Emblem of India\\" and the Ashoka Chakra (Wheel) from which has been placed in the center of the \\"National Flag of India\\" - See \\"lioncapital\\" from Columbia University Website, New York, USA *National symbols of India Category:Indian art Category:National symbols of India Category:Sculptures in India Category:Sculptures of lions Category:Buddhist symbols Category:Memorials to Ashok Category:Mauryan art Category:Lions in religion Category:Sarnath Category:Indian Buddhist sculpture 7 Things To Know About Ashok Stambh ","title":"Lion Capital of Ashoka"},{"id":"33652284","text":"Flavius Ennodius Messala was an Italian senator in Ostrogothic Italy.

The epicenter of the earthquake was in the vicinity of several active wastewater injection wells. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), it was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Oklahoma; this record was surpassed by the 2016 Oklahoma earthquake. The previous record was a 5.5 magnitude earthquake that struck near the town of El Reno in 1952. The quake's epicenter was approximately east-northeast of Oklahoma City, near the town of Sparks and was felt in the neighboring states of Texas, Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri and even as far away as Tennessee and Wisconsin. The quake followed several minor quakes earlier in the day, including a 4.7 magnitude foreshock. The quake had a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in the area closest to the epicenter. Numerous aftershocks were detected after the main quake, with a few registering at 4.0 magnitude. In March 28, 2016 the USGS released the USGS National Seismic Hazard Map which concluded that the primary cause of the earthquake in Oklahoma in 2011 was pressure on faults from cumulative effects of injecting oil drilling wastewater under high pressure into the underground. Although the 2011 earthquake was the largest on record, the USGS reported that the central and eastern U.S. (CEUS) has undergone the most dramatic increase in seismic activity in the United States since 2009 with an average of 318 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 a year up from 24 a year from 1973 to 2008. In 2015 there were 1,010 earthquakes in the CEUS region. By mid-March 2016 there were already 226 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 and larger in the CEUS. \\"Earthquake rates have recently increased markedly in multiple areas of the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS), especially since 2010, and scientific studies have linked the majority of this increased activity to wastewater injection in deep disposal wells.\\"  Geology  The Oklahoma Geological Survey believes the earthquake occurred along the Wilzetta Fault, which is also known as the Seminole Uplift. The Wilzetta Fault is a long fault zone that runs from central Pottawatomie County to the western part of Creek County. It is a strike-slip fault, where two adjacent crustal blocks slide horizontally past each other, but unlike the similar moving San Andreas Fault, the Wilzetta Fault is not located near the margins of any tectonic plates. From 1972 to 2008, between two and six earthquakes were recorded annually by the USGS, however 50 were recorded in 2009. The USGS and the Oklahoma Geological Survey are installing more seismometers to better monitor the increased activity. Aftershocks from the 5.6 quake, including some that can be felt, were expected to last for months. The Oklahoma Geological Survey reported in 2011 that a minor earthquake swarm which occurred in January 2011 could possibly have been due to hydraulic fracturing, which is a process used to extract oil from oil wells. In November 2011 several geologists with the USGS that were contacted by The Huffington Post said that the 5.6 magnitude quake was not due to the mechanical process of hydraulic fracturing itself, which they said causes tremors on a much smaller scale. According to the 2016 USGS report, \\"Earthquake rates have recently increased markedly in multiple areas of the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS), especially since 2010, and scientific studies have linked the majority of this increased activity to wastewater injection in deep disposal wells.\\" In March 2013, an article published in the scientific journal Geology observed that \\"the volume of fluid injected into the subsurface related to the production of unconventional resources continues to rise\\" and this potentially triggered the earthquake.via EBSCO An issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research published in March 2014 found that a magnitude 5.0 foreshock believed to be induced by fluid injection promoted failure of the rupture plain of the November 5 mainshock.  Damage  Early reports indicated that U.S. Route 62 had \\"buckled\\" in three locations and that several nearby homes had major damage and there were also numerous reports of broken windows and other minor damage, mostly to residences. Some local residents reported minor masonry damage and a chimney collapsed at one residence, while a few residents near the epicenter reported a noise which sounded like thunder in the distance as the earthquake struck. The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management reported that two people suffered minor injuries, 14 homes had various levels of damage, and that Benedictine Hall at St. Gregory's University in Shawnee had one turret collapse and two others damaged, forcing the closure of the building. Sandra and Gary Ladra of Prague, suffered physical injuries and damages to their home, during the earthquake. They sued Spess Oil and Old Dominion, LLC, for compensation. In July 2017, Spess came to a confidential settlement in the case, which was before the Oklahoma Supreme Court.Oil company settles earthquake damage suit, Michelle Charles, Stillwater News Press, July 6, 2017. Retrieved July 8, 2017.  Radar imagery  The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that weather radar detected insects, bats and birds which had apparently taken flight immediately after the quake. The NWS radar indicated that the tremors were significant enough that those animals that could leave the ground, did so.

Known especially for his involvement in political incidents, and for a stated patriotism bordering on demagogy, he tested all political formulas that Romania's two-party system would allow. His activity in the public sphere brought a decades-long presence in the Assembly of Deputies and a mandate as Mayor of Bucharest between 1884 and 1886. After beginnings with the National Liberal Party, which he helped establish and represented in court, Fleva came to oppose its monopoly on power. He experimented with creating a third party, negotiated common platforms for the various opposition forces, including the Conservatives and the Junimea society, during contiguous National Liberal administrations. Fleva was notoriously involved in the major scandals of the 1880s, when his ridicule of National Liberal power generated street battles and sparked two separate shooting incidents. At the time, \\"Flevist\\" groups were seen as the leading voice of middle class discontent, and formed one of several currents pushing for the adoption of universal male suffrage. Fleva returned into the National Liberal camp when he was refused a leading role in Conservative cabinets, and, in 1895‚Äì1896, was the Internal Affairs Minister. He clashed with the party over a number of issues, returned into opposition, and was later (1899‚Äì1900) the Conservative Minister of Agriculture. Involved as both accused and whistleblower in some corruption scandals of the early 20th century, he was sent as Ambassador to Italy, and ended his career with a stint in the Conservative-Democratic Party. During World War I, Fleva brought suspicion on himself as a supporter, and possible agent of influence, of the Central Powers.

Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"Familia unui aghiotant regal\\", in Ziarul Financiar, May 21, 2009 In youth, Nicolae Fleva attended the Saint Sava College, Bucharest, and graduated in Law at the University of Naples (1867).Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.123 Upon his return to Romania, Fleva spent a period tending to his lands in Putna County, pursuing interests in agriculture and horse breeding: he judged in ploughing contests at local fairs, and received a silver medal for his mare Diditia.Ionescu de la Brad, p.519, 533 Fleva brought professional harness racing to Romania, and received honorable mention for his own contribution to that sport.Ionescu de la Brad, p.534 In addition to building a legal career, and becoming one of the most successful legal professionals of the 1870s,Mugur IsƒÉrescu, Surica Rosentuler, Sabina Mari»õiu, Restitutio 3. Via»õa »ôi opera lui Eugeniu Carada, National Bank of Romania, 2003, p.25 Fleva created a trademark and highly unconventional political style. Described by contemporaries as possessing a warm and engaging voice,Boia (1973), p.79; Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.123 he relied on patriotic-themed oratory, and reportedly could speak for four hours on end without accepting interruptions.

Dezastruoasa guvernare a primarului-tribun acuzat de crimƒÉ\\", in AdevƒÉrul, April 16, 2011 Ion Luca Caragiale, Un interview (wikisource) He notoriously organized electoral National Liberal rallies in front of patriotic landmarks, such as the Michael the Brave Monument in University Square. With time, Fleva became known to his supporters as Tribunul, \\"the Tribune\\",Bacalba»ôa, p.72, 206, 220, 230, 247, 260, 266, 268; Boia (2010), p.94; Durnea, p.40; Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.125; Rusu Abrudeanu, p.112-113 or variations of that nickname. Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"Un pictor fin de si√®cle\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 17/2009 Writing in 2011, journalist Maria Apostol called him \\"one of the most controversial political figures in the history of Romania.\\" Fleva himself did not preoccupy himself with his colleagues' resentment of his conduct, publicizing his motto: \\"I'd rather have enemies who respect me than friends who despise me.\\" One of the first causes involving Fleva, as a young figure in the liberal-republican opposition, was the dispute between liberals and Romania's monarch, Domnitor Carol of Hohenzollern. The \\"Tribune\\" was first elected to the Assembly in the 1870 race, representing the 4th (lowest) Electoral College in Putna County. He stood out in that legislature with claims that the election for town and city councils were being rigged by the political establishment, and congratulated those who, like Nicolae Moret Blaremberg, denounced the politics of Prime Minister M. C. Epureanu. \\"Romani'a. Adunarea Deputatiloru. Siedinti'a de la 3. decembre 1870\\", in Federatiunea, Nr. 131/1870, p.511-512 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) The period saw him joining a defense team for soldiers and civilians prosecuted for their roles in the \\"Republic of Ploie»ôti\\" conspiracy‚Äîall of them, including liberal leaders Ion BrƒÉtianu, C. A. Rosetti, Eugeniu Carada and Anton I. Arion, were acquitted. Bogdan Jitea, \\" 'Republica de la Ploie»ôti' a»ôa cum n-a vƒÉzut-o Caragiale\\", in Historia online edition; retrieved November 5, 2011Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.68, 123 Fleva, who rested his defense tactic on contending that Epureanu's men had incited and misled Romanian republicans, publicized his speeches in court as the 1871 booklet Procesul lui 8 august. ApƒÉrarea fƒÉcutƒÉ celor 41 acusa»õi (\\"The Trial of August 8. The Defense of the 41 Accused\\"). This was to be the first of several confrontations between Fleva and Carol, who even consider abdicating the throne after the verdict came out. Fleva was again sent to the Assembly after the 1871 election, but this time represented Muscel County. His hold of the seat was contested by a rival politician, Potoceanu: in early 1875, just before the scheduled election the Assembly plenum ruled to remove Fleva from his position of deputy. \\"Romani'a\\", in Federatiunea, Nr. 19-20/1875, p.60 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) =1875 arrest and the \\"Mazar Pa»ôa\\" coalition= Subsequently, Fleva played a part in the effort to unite a single liberal opposition against the conservatism of Prime Minister LascƒÉr Catargiu and other political leaders closest to Carol. By then the Bucharest-based liberal movement expanded its basis, reaching out to various undecided liberal clubs. It was soon joined by the main anti-Catargiu factions: a moderate current spearheaded by Ion Ghica and Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu; Nicolae Ionescu and his \\"Fractionists\\" from the eastern Romanian province of Moldavia; and a group of former conservatives such as Epureanu.Boia (1973), p.79 The first result of their effort was a political gazette, AlegƒÉtorul Liber (\\"The Enfranchised Voter\\"). Fleva was part of the Editorial Committee, which included almost all of the liberal leadership (excluding C. A. Rosetti), and employed the young satirical journalist Ion Luca Caragiale as copy editor. Carried by Fleva's oratory and by expos√©s in AlegƒÉtorul Liber,Boia (1973), p.79-80 the liberal campaigners entered the 1875 electoral race with confidence. The moment degenerated in national confusion, after supporters of the two sides organized brawl and a pro-Catargiu electoral agent was killed in public.Boia (1973), p.80 Citing concerns that Fleva was inciting Bucharest's populace, the Prime Minister ordered his arrest, and Fleva was detained in VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti prison; the young politician was released in short time.Boia (1973), p.80; Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.123 Welcomed back by \\"a delirious crowd\\", he also took part in successfully defending the anti-conservative poet Alexandru Macedonski, who faced similar accusations.Tudor Vianu, Scriitori rom√¢ni, Vol. II, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1971, p.369. The signing of a commercial agreement between Romania and Austria-Hungary, her protectionist neighbor to the northwest, angered the anti-Austrian liberals, to the point where a liberal conspiracy began to emerge.Boia (1973), p.78-79 At this point in time, the liberal factions found support from Stephen \\"Mazar Pa»ôa\\" Lakeman, who, as a loyal subject of the British Kingdom, may have intended to steer Romania away from its Austrian commitments.Boia (1973), p.80-81 Fleva was personally involved in the negotiations presided upon by Lakeman, which resulted in the formation of a single National Liberal Party.Boia (1973), p.78, 80-81; Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.123 His name features among those of 25 members of the party's \\"Steering Committee\\", on a list published by Rosetti's Rom√¢nul in June 1875.Boia (1973), p.80; Cosmin Lucian Gherghe, \\"Geneza liberalismului din Rom√¢nia\\", in the University of Craiova Revista de »òtiin»õe Politice, Nr. 18-19/2008, p.127 By March 1876, Catargiu fell out of favor with Carol, who reportedly decided that, as candidate for the premiership, BrƒÉtianu was \\"reasonable and humble\\".Boia (1973), p.82 This followed a winter of National Liberal agitation, with renewed plans for a Romanian Republic, and then an understanding between the two sides, brokered by Romanian Police chief Ion BƒÉlƒÉceanu.Boia (1973), p.81-83 Nicolae Fleva returned as National Liberal deputy in the early elections of 1876, and was reconfirmed in 1879. The new Premier, Ion BrƒÉtianu, promoted Fleva to a position of influence in the party: with Eugeniu StƒÉtescu and Mihail Pherekyde, Fleva controlled the grassroots campaign against non-liberals. With fellow deputy Pantazi Ghica, he organized a prolonged inquiry by Parliament into the activities of former ministers. From July to December 1876, his Informative Commission toured the country, verifying some 140 dossiers of secret correspondence, organizing house searches, and publishing a 964-pages report.Bulei (1973), p.28-30 He was at the time collecting support for a motion to sue Catargiu for damages, years after Catargiu had quelled the riots in Bucharest. Such initiatives embarrassed the more moderate liberals (led by KogƒÉlniceanu and Epureanu), outraged the conservative press, and were ultimately defeated in Parliament.Bulei (1973), p.25, 27-28, 29-30 Despite being engaged at the core of liberal politics, Fleva defended former Education Minister Titu Maiorescu, founder of the conservative club Junimea. Maiorescu was himself becoming a rival of Catargiu, and stood for a \\"Young Conservative\\" reform movement.Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.115 Fleva's special commission investigated Maiorescu' malfeasance in office, following allegations made by the National Liberal Andrei Vizanti, and Fleva's vote helped clear Maiorescu of all charges.I. E. Torou»õiu, notes to Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol, Istoria ideilor mele (wikisource) During those months, Fleva also participated in the heated debate about regulating wheat trade between Romania and the Russian Empire. Against the position held by Catargiu, and against voices from his own party, Fleva suggested that Russia's demand for most favored nation status was acceptable.Frederick Kellogg, The Road to Romanian Independence (1866‚Äî1914), Purdue University Press, West Lafayette, 1995, p.104-105. =New-generation liberal and mayoral election= Public works on the D√¢mbovi≈£a River, ca. 1881‚Äì1886 Fleva's term as deputy also coincided with historical events relating to the Russo-Turkish War and Romanian independence. On May 9, 1877, he inquired Foreign Minister KogƒÉlniceanu about the Russian attack on the Ottoman Empire; KogƒÉlniceanu confirmed that Romania considered itself independent from her Ottoman sovereign. »òerban RƒÉdulescu-Zoner, \\"Cli»ôee comuniste repuse √Æn circula»õie\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, May 28, 2009 Although taken by some to mean that Romania was free as of May 9, this carefully staged discussion was rather a preamble to the actual independence declaration of May 10. Having also presented himself in elections for the Bucharest Communal Council, Fleva became one of three assistants to Mayor C. A. Rosetti, whose mandate coincided with the first year of Romania's war. B. L. Bianu, \\"Salonu. Scrisori din Bucuresci\\", in Familia, Nr. 22/1877, p.261 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Also then, Fleva, Carada, StƒÉtescu and other members of Rosetti's faction were elected officers of the \\"Citizens' Guard\\", a paramilitary organization.Maria Totu, \\"Garda civicƒÉ √Æn rƒÉzboiul de independen»õƒÉ\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1970, p.80 Their activity there was reported with alarm by the conservative gazette Timpul: \\"The city's Guard [...], following its earlier establishment as an armed force with commanders elected from within its own ranks, all of them improvised officers wearing [...] insignia designed during times of revolution, officers with no military skill, no discipline and no title [...], not only does it not represent any sort of guaranteed safety, but, what is more, could always turn itself into a dangerous element of social upheaval.\\" Around 1880, when the anti-liberal pole was organizing itself into the Conservative Party, Fleva was being identified by his adversaries as a main exponent of a new National Liberal ideology and morality. Writing for Timpul, the national conservative poet and essayist Mihai Eminescu stirred passions with his radical critique of this emerging group, nominating Fleva alongside Pherekyde and others as \\"foreign\\" and \\"superimposed\\" enemies of national development.Ornea (1998), p.193-194; Turda, p.195-196 George Virgil Stoenescu, \\"La √Ænceput a fost Carada\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 1057, June 2010 In one of his lampoons, published in August 1882, Eminescu uses analogy to suggest that Pherekyde's shadow cabinet was an anti-national abomination: \\"Dear people! What would you say if the Chancellor of Germany were named Pherekydes, if its ministers were named Carada, Fleva and Chiri»õopol [...], if in that somewhere where all people have names like Meyer and M√ºller, all of its governing class were foreign? [...] You'd say: a destitute people that, driven to work like oxen to feed foreigners, foreigners and yet more foreigners.\\" As scholar Marius Turda notes, the objections were partly justified, since the new generation brought with it less credibility and more corruption.Turda, p.195 Fleva may even have been partly responsible for sacking Eminescu from the office of librarian, back when the National Liberals first began evaluating the loyalties of public servants.Bulei (1973), p.29-30; M. G. Samariteanu, \\"Eminescu »ôi Familia\\", in Familia, Nr. 3-4/1937, p.7 (digitized by the Babe»ô- Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) However, Eminescu's expanding xenophobia caused disquiet in Conservative circles, since many Conservative leaders were of noted Greek or other non-Romanian origin.Ornea (1998), p.194 The interval witnessed renewed republican agitation, during which Nicolae Fleva openly sided with revolutionary politics. In 1883, when members of his party hoped to obtain Carol's resignation, he instructed the public about the right of revolution. His speech was reviewed in 2012 by academic Codrin Liviu Cu»õitaru as a classic misinterpretation of that principle, since it validated a permanent \\"state of revolt\\" among those who felt disenfranchised. Codrin Liviu Cu»õitaru, \\"Un episod clasic din publicistica lui Caragiale\\" , in Dilema Veche, Nr. 416, February 2012 Fleva's position as deputy was reconfirmed in the 1883 national elections, and again in the 1884 vote. These were the first- ever elections to be carried under a new electoral law, pushed by the core group of National Liberal, and extending representation and disestablishing the 4th Electoral College.Radu, p.134-135 By then, the \\"Tribune\\" had his fief in Bucharest, and his appeal there propelled him to the office of Mayor during the local election of 1884. However, he also benefited from Eugeniu StƒÉtescu's withdrawal from the National Liberal caucus, which propelled Fleva to head of the electoral list.Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.96 Fleva did not replace an active Mayor, but rather took his seat from an interim bureau, presided upon by M. T√∂r√∂k. Corneliu »òenchea, \\"Scandalurile mondene de odinioarƒÉ (III) - Duiliu Zamfirescu, un hidalgo √Ænt√¢rziat\\" , in Historia online edition; retrieved November 5, 2011 Fleva's own team of Councilors included 6 public figures, among them civil engineer Grigore Cerchez and future Mayor Ion Dobrovici (both of whom survived recall, serving in Fleva's second advisory team). \\"Primar de Bucure»ôti - Episodul 4: Nicolae Fleva\\" , in Time Out Bucharest, April 2, 2008 The team's focus was on the sanitation of D√¢mbovi»õa River, for which purpose Mayor Fleva contracted English engineer William Lindley. Upon inspection, Lindley advised against using D√¢mbovi»õa as a water supply, even as filters had been installed, and the project began to redirect water from further upstream. =United Opposition= Nicolae Fleva in an 1881 lithograph Fleva's time in National Liberal politics ended while he was still Mayor, under an Ion BrƒÉtianu cabinet. Known to his adversaries as \\"The Vizier\\", the Prime Minister was for a while unchallenged in his party, having marginalized his most powerful competitor C. A. Rosetti.Boia (1973), p.84; Radu, p.134-136, 137 Ion BrƒÉtianu even faced opposition from his brother, Dimitrie BrƒÉtianu. The latter took on Rosetti's campaign for universal male suffrage, but, unlike Rosetti's radicals, still favored the over-representation of Romania's middle class.Radu, p.133-137 Close to this pole, Fleva was among those jaded party militants who accused their Prime Minister of tyrannical stances, and who turned on Carol (by then King of Romania). This time around, Carol stood accused of having created a political machine in association with Ion BrƒÉtianu.Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.80-81 Fleva soon became the main accusatory voice, producing evidence which incriminated two National Liberal policy- makers: Emil Costinescu and Pherekyde. The latter, an expert shot, provoked Fleva to a duel by pistol, injuring his right hand.Bacalba»ôa, p.40 Fleva's personal quarrel with BrƒÉtianu reached its peak with another such duel. BrƒÉtianu was the one to provoke Fleva, when the latter described the cabinet as a collection of \\"shadows\\"; Fleva's shot missed its target and then BrƒÉtianu's bullet hit him near the heart, but he luckily survived. Daniela C√¢rlea »òonticƒÉ, Andrei Oi»ôteanu, \\"De la sfadƒÉ la spadƒÉ\\", in Jurnalul Na»õional, January 16, 2006 The period witnessed the birth of a new political conglomerate, called \\"Liberal Conservative Party\\": the Conservatives, alongside the dissenting \\"Sincere Liberals\\", plus the Moldavian \\"Fractionists\\".Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.80 Political trouble ensued. The monarch, who now trusted BrƒÉtianu above all other politicians, refused to apply his prerogative, and would not rotate between the two dominant factions. Z. Ornea, \\"Capitala de odinioarƒÉ\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 13/2001 With former enemy Catargiu, Fleva signed a manifesto against Carol, in which they alluded to the possibility of an anti-monarchical rebellion. In disparaging tone, the two united factions began referring to the National Liberal doctrinaires as \\"collectivists\\". Valentin Bodea, \\"La Maison Robescu\\", in the V. A. Urechia Library Axis Libri, Nr. 4, September 2009, p.29 Fleva was personally involved in forging the \\"United Opposition\\" bloc‚Äîhe and Dimitrie BrƒÉtianu were among the recognized leaders of this new movement. Fleva also discussed cooperation with Junimea, the Conservative inner faction and splinter group, meeting with Junimist spokesman Alexandru Marghiloman.Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.124 With Dimitrie BrƒÉtianu and other United Opposition men, he took part in agitation against the agents of government in Gala»õi city, responding to reports that the elections there where always fraudulent.Bacalba»ôa, p.45 In 1886, his own faction was joined by other former National Liberals, including Constantin C. Arion and Take Ionescu.Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.171 With Ionescu and young Conservative figure Nicolae Filipescu, Fleva created short-lived political club, the \\"League of Resistance\\" (1888),Bacalba»ôa, p.48; Mircea Dumitriu, \\"Un om politic european: Dumitru (Take) Ionescu\\", in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, June 2, 2007 but Ionescu soon after made his way into the Conservative Party. As Mayor, Nicolae Fleva was noted for setting up Sf√¢ntul Anton Market (near Manuc's Inn) and Eforiei Bathhouse (by Ci»ômigiu Gardens), and, in following with his passion for horses, for donating the BƒÉneasa grounds which became Bucharest's Racecourse. Ion Bulei, \\"File din galopul vremii\\", in Ziarul Financiar, April 6, 2007 During his mandate, Bucharest saw the completion of 1,190 townhouses, including tens of two-, three- or four-story buildings. Some have nevertheless described these as unimportant achievements; literary historian Ioana P√¢rvulescu summarizes his term with the words \\"he did nothing\\", Cristian Teodorescu, \\"Amintiri din viitorul secolului 19 rom√¢nesc\\" , in Cotidianul, December 30, 2005 while, according to Apostol, Fleva \\"left no trace on how Bucharest developed\\". The administration started with a budget of 8,500,000 French francs, but the collected sum dropped to 7,660,000 by 1885, and stabilized itself at 7,807,000 in 1886. Fleva eventually presented his resignation in April 1886, citing disagreements with the City Council and the leaders of Police.Bacalba»ôa, p.25-26 He had by then drafted and proposed, unsuccessfully, a reform of the law on the attributes of Prefects.

The Illustrated London News, April 14, 1888 Such controversies reflected Nicolae Fleva's ongoing conflict with government: in 1887, he was again publicly asking King Carol not to endorse Ion BrƒÉtianu's agenda. He registered a personal victory by proving to the Assembly that government had pocketed large sums set aside for building Bucharest's system of forts.Bacalba»ôa, p.50-51 After disputed elections for the city council of Gala»õi, the executive prosecuted Catargiu, Dimitrie BrƒÉtianu and George D. Vernescu as instigators. Fleva was part of the defense team (with Nicolae Moret Blaremberg, Petre GrƒÉdi»ôteanu, Alexandru Lahovary, Alexandru Djuvara, George D. Pallade etc.); on December 18, 1887, the judge acquitted all of the accused. Fleva, Blaremberg and Ioan Lahovary also defended the republican George Panu in his legal face-off with the king (in his newspaper Lupta, Panu had published the United Opposition pamphlet \\"A Dangerous Man\\", where Carol was the main target). \\"V√¢rsta de aur a avocaturii rom√¢ne»ôti\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, July 3, 2006Bacalba»ôa, p.42-44 They lost, and Panu was sentenced to a two-year term in jail.Bacalba»ôa, p.42 The electoral start of 1888 brought an explosive situation. All opposition forces, including Fleva's group, reached most of their electoral goals, even though the government remained in place.Bacalba»ôa, p.53-54 On March 14, when Carol returned from a visit to Berlin, Fleva, with Catargiu, Blaremberg and various others, instigated a riot which began at Orfeu Hall, Bucharest. Under their supervision, the crowd trying to occupy the building and make it an anti-government fief found its access blocked by pro-government men (soldiers, mounted Gendarmes, police or simply National Liberal militants). C. Gane, \\"Mineriada din timpul lui Carol I (13-15 martie 1888)\\", in Historia online edition; retrieved November 5, 2011 A chase followed through the city center, and the rioters attempted to make their way into the (old) Royal Palace, to demand that the king dispose of BrƒÉtianu. The king watched on, impassively.Cristescu, p.64 The events were viewed with astonishment by the third parties at Junimea. Its elder Petre P. Carp reported his horror at seeing soldiers attacking people who had done \\"absolutely nothing\\". The United Opposition protest of March 15, which accused BrƒÉtianu of carrying out a \\"massacre\\", was signed by Junimists Marghiloman and Iacob Negruzzi, although not by Carp.Bacalba»ôa, p.62 The same day, all opposition forces staged a March of Mourning to the Assembly Palace, but again the road was barricaded by armed forces. The deputies were allowed access into the hall, but the ceremony was interrupted when a rifle or a pistol was mysteriously shot, killing one of the ushers present. The deputies panicked before troops stormed in, and Carp was found standing near the dead body, engaged in a row with the National Liberals' Dimitrie Sturdza. A version of the events, promoted by journalist and memoirist Constantin Bacalba»ôa, points to a government conspiracy. According to Bacalba»ôa, I. BrƒÉtianu's men had paid a Sergent Silaghi to aim his gun at Fleva; the usher was shot by accident.Bacalba»ôa, p.63-64 In the end, Fleva and Filipescu were both arrested.Bacalba»ôa, p.64Ion Bulei, \\"P. P. Carp ‚Äì un aristocrat al politicii rom√¢ne»ôti\\", in Magazin Istoric, December 1999, p.28 Fleva stood accused of inciting the riots, and even suspected of the murder: police alleged that a gun had been found on his person, but other reports state that none of the deputies was armed. Carp himself took the stand against government actions, denouncing a cover-up attempt. =Theodor Rosetti cabinet= Constantin Jiquidi, Cor de negri (\\"Black Men's Choir\\"), 1888 cartoon in the Conservative paper Epoca. Fleva, George D. Pallade, and other National Liberal dissidents \\"serenading\\" the Conservative doyen LascƒÉr Catargiu In short while, a mainly Junimist cabinet headed by Theodor Rosetti was to take over. This was Carol's own choice of Prime Minister: the king recognized the National Liberal crisis, but adamantly refused to follow the United Opposition agenda. Fleva was promptly released from VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti, and again delivered to the enthusiastic crowds.Bacalba»ôa, p.67-68; Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.124 More disturbance soon followed. The BƒÉrƒÉgan Plain peasantry was rising up in revolt, believing that Rosetti was going to quash a National Liberal plan for extensive land reform. Their attack on private property was severely punished by the authorities.Cristescu, passim Nicolae Fleva was subsequently approached by Carp with an offer to head Internal Affairs. Legend goes that there was a debate among them, concerning the sanctity of free suffrage, which governments in power tended to ignore. Fleva reportedly accepted Carp's initial offer, on condition that the Junimists hold free elections; the latter's reply was: \\"No free elections! But we'll get real elections!\\" The pro-Conservative daily Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, whose editor Duiliu Zamfirescu was a passionate critic of Fleva, suggested that there was an unbridgeable gap, in both doctrine and interests, between the former two sides of United Opposition: \\"On one hand the Junimists with the Liberal-Conservatives and the Young Conservatives, supporting the government and holding the door open for all men of decency who, through similarity in ideas, may wish to work for the actual consolidation of the state and a true betterment of Romanian society; on the other the defeated collectivists, who will put out for any liberal who will fight the government, be they Fleva, Panu, GrƒÉdi»ôteanu and Dim[itrie] BrƒÉtianu. In order to grow back into a force, [the National Liberals] are willing to bring into the family even their most unrelenting enemies of yesterday.\\" Beatrice Kiseleff, \\"RƒÉsfoind Rom√¢nia liberƒÉ (XLVII)\\", in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, July 26, 2007 Fleva himself acknowledged that the split had occurred: leaving behind the United Opposition, he presented himself as an independent in the 1888 race for the Bucharest City Hall. A number of local guilds, including the cooperative movement of Dimitrie C. Butculescu, supported him in this effort, but he only finished in a distant third; the Conservative Pache Protopopescu won the day.Bacalba»ôa, p.71-72 With the second-round Assembly elections, he won a seat in Prahova, in a loose alliance with the National Liberals, announcing his reconciliation with I. BrƒÉtianu.Bacalba»ôa, p.76, 107 In the process, Fleva lost the respect of his Conservative ally, Filipescu, who denounced him as a vacuous (and therefore detestable) \\"man of the people\\".Bacalba»ôa, p.73 Slowly, Fleva returned into the National Liberal fold. In 1890, he voted against prosecuting I. BrƒÉtianu for alleged mismanagement of the country, and also against Panu's proposal to reestablish the League of Resistance.Bacalba»ôa, p.114-115, 117, 119 Leaving Panu behind, he and D. BrƒÉtianu rejoined the National Liberal directorial committee.Bacalba»ôa, p.120 Fleva was a National Liberal candidate to the Assembly of Deputies in the election of January 1891. He won the second available seat for that constituency, benefiting from months of Junimist and Conservative infighting.Bacalba»ôa, p.126, 128 Fleva's return as a National Liberal doctrinaire was facilitated by I. BrƒÉtianu's death in 1891. He was persuaded by the new party leader, Dimitrie Sturdza, and his platform, the \\"Program of Ia»ôi\\" (November 1892). It promised to support the gradual introduction of universal male suffrage and proportional representation.Radu, p.138 However, Fleva failed to persuade Sturdza that the party should come to power by rebellion. King Carol firmly supported the Conservative administration, again headed by Catargiu. Finally, Premier Catargiu was denounced by Fleva for ordering a clampdown on the republican newspaper, AdevƒÉrul.Bacalba»ôa, p.152 =Interior Minister= Bucharest crowds demonstrating in support of Transylvania, 1892 During that time, Fleva was especially interested in the fate of Romanians living in Transylvania or in other parts of Austria-Hungary, many of whom were complaining about government abuse and Magyarization policies (Transylvanian Memorandum). Representing Romania at a peace congress in Rome, Fleva spoke positively about the demands of Romanian Transylvanian students, and obtained from the international representative a resolution favoring respect for national rights.Cri»ôan, p.31-32 He built contacts with Austria-Hungary's Romanian National Party and the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians, being a special guest at their 1894 banquet in Bucharest.Cri»ôan, p.173 Also that year, Fleva donated books to the Romanians of Bukovina region, through their Society for Romanian Literature and Culture. \\"Din Bucovina\\", in Transilvania, Nr. 3/1894, p.67 (digitized by the Babe»ô- Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Fleva was again in Parliament in December 1894, when he narrowly lost the elections for Assembly Vice President. \\"Sƒïptƒïm√¢na\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 47/1894, p.2 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) He had a notoriously tense relationship with Eugeniu Carada, who, as the National Liberal's economic adviser, had helped establish Romania's National Bank. In February 1894, Fleva upset Carada by running for National Bank Censor, with support from the Conservatives and the Junimists.Bacalba»ôa, p.174-175 Like the other National Liberal deputies, Fleva resented the ultra-capitalist Law on Mining, passed by the Conservative majority. However, he distanced himself from those deputies who resigned in protest against the bill: when he did hand in his resignation, it was rejected by his Conservative friends, including Filipescu.Bacalba»ôa, p.176-177 In October 1895, Fleva came to lead Internal Affairs, within Sturdza's National Liberal cabinet. Once appointed by Carol, the government had to be confirmed by an election, and, sources attest, Fleva served his democratic ideal by ensuring that the 1895 election was carried without fraud. Ion Cristoiu, \\"√én materie de lucrƒÉturƒÉ, politicienii de azi sunt bie»õi copii\\", in AdevƒÉrul, May 30, 2010 At the time, Nicolae Fleva's perceived demagogy was a subject of amusement: painter-aristocrat Eugen N. Ghika-Bude»ôti published cartoons of Fleva, showing him as a would-be Gracchus of Romania. This interval also made Fleva a prime target of celebrated Romanian satirist Ion Luca Caragiale, once an AlegƒÉtorul Liber colleague, who had by then moved closer to Junimist politics. In the 1880s, Caragiale had recorded with irony some of Fleva's republican statements, particularly those criticized for inciting bad government. Caragiale ridiculed claims that Fleva's ministerial mandate was an episode of electoral freedom, Ion Luca Caragiale, IarƒÉ»ôi promisia D-lui Fleava (wikisource) depicting him for posterity as pathological in his loquacity. Caragiale's Fleva exhausts himself talking about clergy, Gendarmes, linguistic protectionism and \\"the sovereign people\\". Fleva's involvement in popular causes was turning into a liability. His reintegration by the National Liberal Party effectively split the movement into two competing factions: the \\"Flevists\\", or \\"Liberal Democratic Party\\", represented the middle class and petite bourgeoisie vote; the \\"Sturdzists\\" mainly brought together landowners and bankers.Radu, p.141 The Prime Minister, notorious for his lack of authority, Nicolae Ioni»õƒÉ, \\"Portrete ale oamenilor politici rom√¢ni de la sf√¢r»ôitul secolului al XIX-lea √Æn documente diplomatice germane\\" , in the University of Gala»õi Anale. Seria Istorie, Vol. VII, 2008, p.154 and his Internal Affairs subordinate despised each other, particularly since Fleva realized that Sturdza would never apply the \\"Program of Ia»ôi\\". According to some, Fleva's fight against government abuse was what caused his fall during a cabinet reshuffling, only three months after electoral victory.Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.124; Bacalba»ôa, p.193, 195-196 C. Bacalba»ôa notes that Fleva first attracted his colleagues' hostility when he inspected first- hand, and punished, the damage done by government representatives in the village of Spineni.Bacalba»ôa, p.195-196 Sturdza interpreted this work as a sign of disloyalty, and the National Liberal paper Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ made a show of Fleva, publishing allegations about his conduct in both public and private. In what was virtually an unprecedented gesture, Titu Maiorescu, who had become leader of the opposition, denounced such mudslinging from the Assembly's rostrum. =Fodder scandal and 1897 split= Fleva was eventually faced with accusations that, while in office, he had secretly engaged in contraband. Iepurescu, a Giurgiu County representative, questioned the Minister's provisions against fodder shortages. Iepurescu's story was that, against the specialists' advice, Fleva had ordered massive imports of hay for national or ministerial use. Some, beginning with Maiorescu, have questioned whether Iepurescu himself was a man of character. Fleva asked to present his version with a speech in Parliament, programmed for January 13, 1896. On January 12, Sturdza confirmed that Fleva had lost his office, implying that his activity during the elections was under scrutiny; when the Assembly began preparing procedures to oust him, Fleva became enraged, denouncing the National Liberal Party as an occult organization. He is believed to have coined the term Oculta (\\"The Occult [Faction]\\"), which was subsequently used to designate the secretive triumvirate of National Liberal figures, allegedly Sturdza's puppet-masters: Carada, Pache Protopopescu, Gogu Cantacuzino.Bacalba»ôa, p.98, 99, 141, 174, 195, 221, 229-230 The next day, instead of the scheduled pro domo, the Assembly registered his resignation. Founding the independent newspaper Dreptatea, Fleva turned on his former colleagues in power. In early 1896, he attacked Sturdza for his external policy, creating a scandal about the selective sponsoring of Aromanian schools throughout the Balkans.Bacalba»ôa, p.196-197, 198, 199 In his anti-Sturdza campaign, Fleva approached the country's breakaway socialist clubs. Some socialists did join his faction, but others condemned him for not supporting the immediate adoption of universal suffrage.I. C. Atanasiu, Pagini din istoria contimporanƒÉ a Rom√¢niei: 1881‚Äì1916. I. Mi»ôcarea socialistƒÉ: 1881‚Äì1900, Editura Adevƒïrul, Bucharest [n. y.], p.52, 151-157, 160, 281, 323-324, 345, 401 Fleva's disaffiliation with the National Liberals grew once Sturdza and his ministers intervened in Orthodox Church affairs‚Äîdeposing Metropolitan- Primate Ghenadie Petrescu. Fleva took Ghenadie's side. Especially for the purpose, he set up a new anti-government coalition with the Conservatives, and lend a hand to the eventual fall of Sturdza's cabinet in November 1896.Bacalba»ôa, p.205-211, 212, 218-221; Paul Brusanovski, \\"Structura constitu»õionalƒÉ a Bisericii Ortodoxe Rom√¢ne. Repere istorice\\" , in INTER. Revista Rom√¢nƒÉ de Studii Teologice »ôi Religioase, Nr. 1-2/2007, p.245-246 During the incidents, Fleva reunited with his old friend Alexandru Macedonski, by then a maverick conservative; his articles in support of Ghenadie were published by Macedonski's political-literary review Liga OrtodoxƒÉ. Also joining Fleva's group were the former socialists George A. Scor»õescu, who published Evenimentul newspaper, and Anton \\"Toni\\" Bacalba»ôa.Durnea, p.40, 42 Pushing for a return to power, Fleva sought to align himself with the king's external policy. Toning down his support for Transylvanian agitation, he published a salute to Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph, who was visiting Bucharest.Bacalba»ôa, p.214 Despite such overtures, the outgoing Sturdza received a formal promise from his many adversaries that Fleva would never again be granted ministerial office.Bacalba»ôa, p.221 Subsequently, the parliamentary Flevists (described by one Transylvanian observer as \\"Mr. Fleva and seven of his comrades\\") reluctantly voted in favor of some National Liberal laws, but aimed most of its activities against Sturdza's cabinet. \\"Situa»õia √Æn Rom√¢nia\\", in Tribuna Poporului, Nr. 73/1898, p.1 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) In February 1898, Fleva was the only parliamentarian to vote against the national debt- conversion project, as advanced by Finance Minister Gogu Cantacuzino. \\"Scrisoare din Bucure»ôti\\", in Tribuna Poporului, Nr. 36/1898, p.174 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) In tandem, a second dissident faction, formed around Petre S. Aurelian and Drapelul newspaper, and likewise attached to electoral reform projects, took still more voters away from the National Liberal Party. Instead of courting the Flevists, Sturdza managed to prolong his hold on power by attracting back some of the Drapelul men, including some 13 deputies. =Agriculture Minister= Ministry of Agriculture and Royal Domains, photographed by Alexandru Antoniu in 1900 The Conservative and Junimist factions preserved Fleva in their camp, making him more or less concrete promises about a return to high office.Bacalba»ôa, p.230, 254, 261 In their name, Fleva carried out street battles with the Sturdza party, and, with Maiorescu and others, established a \\"Committee of Resistance\\" (against the Strudza government).Bacalba»ôa, p.246-247 A classically trained scholar, Maiorescu expressed disdain for all the liberal subgroups, as sciolistic upstarts. In a letter of June 1898, he made special note of these developments: \\"All the Liberals, the Drapelul men and of course the Flevists too, are utterly ignorant (except for Sturdza and Beldiman [...]) and enrich themselves through politics. [...] StƒÉtescu or LascƒÉr, or Costinescu, or Fleva [...] might even be looking to find Cam√µes among their contemporaries\\". Ion Bulei, \\"Liberalismul √Æn lume »ôi la noi (II)\\" , in Cadran Politic, Nr. 10, January 2004 Historian Ion Bulei, who sees Maiorescu's text is a cruel satire, also writes that it addresses a deeper reality: \\"if the doctrinaire level of all Romanian politicians was rather base in what was Old Romania, the liberals' was yet more base. Between the practical accomplishments of the National Liberal Party and the level of its intellectual preoccupations, there was always disharmony.\\" Reputedly, Fleva officially joined the Conservative Party in 1899,Durnea, p.40; Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.124 but, to the press, he was more a \\"national democrat\\" ally of the Conservative militants. \\"Salon. Ce e nou\\", in Familia, Nr. 16/1899, p.192 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) On April 11 of that year, Premier Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino came to power after the fall of another Sturdza cabinet and four months of government crisis, placing Fleva in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Royal Domains. He would serve until June 7, 1900. The \\"Tribune\\" also received a ninth mandate in the Assembly during the elections of 1899, which confirmed the Conservative gains.Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.123, 124 However, the election itself dampened his ministerial ambitions: in Slatina, the peasant voters were allegedly instigated to rebel by the political boss Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti, leading to a massacre. Probably called upon as an arbiter by Bogdan-Pite»ôti, Fleva visited the area and conducted an inquiry.Bacalba»ôa, p.265-266 As a consequence of the government's mistakes in handling the crisis, Fleva is said to have considered resigning. \\"O jale in Rom√¢nia\\", in Tribuna Poporului, Nr. 114/1899, p.2 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) This new mandate was soon touched by another controversy involving fodder supplies. With drought on the horizon, Fleva again ordered imported hay, much more than was needed, and any excess amount was destroyed by rainfall.Bacalba»ôa, p.269; Simona Vasilache, \\"Viitorul »ôi trecutul\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 49/2009 Fleva himself observed irregularities at the State Fisheries, but his move to depose their caretaker, Grigore Antipa, was resisted by other Conservatives.Bacalba»ôa, p.267 Another unusual and criticized decision taken by Fleva (in his secondary capacity as Minister of Industry and Commerce) was the abolition of virtually all patents, measures justified by his belief that intellectual property rights were holding back industrialization.Iancu, p.59 This policy, backed by a sizable portion of the public, was only repealed in 1906, under continued pressure from the international arms industry.Iancu, p.59-61 =Ambassador and Conservative- Democrat= Fleva and Take Ionescu as fellow demagogues, trading in \\"thumping lies\\". 1908 cartoon by Ion Theodorescu-Sion In February 1901, Nicolae Fleva was made the Romanian Ambassador to Italy‚Äîa position he maintained until July 1909. As one of his activities there, Fleva officially represented Romanian interests during the creation of an International Institute of Agriculture, and signed its founding document in 1905. During those years, Fleva was also indulging his passion for horse racing. After 1905, when a replica of Longchamp Racecourse was eventually built in Bucharest (on grounds now occupied by Casa Presei Libere), he became one of the regular visitors. Andrei CrƒÉciun, Adi Dobre, \\"Povestea unei lumi dispƒÉrute: cursele de cai din Rom√¢nia\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, October 21, 2008 While still involved in European diplomacy, Fleva was attracted into the Conservative-Democratic Party. This new force rallied around his old colleague Take Ionescu, who, like Fleva himself, had divided his earlier career between the two main parties. Described by the press as Ionescu's right hand, Fleva ran in the Assembly elections of 1908, as top of the Conservative-Democratic list for Bucharest. His campaign was unusually supported by Caragiale, who had turned Conservative-Democrat, and who spoke directly to the regular voters about Fleva's merits. Ion N. Nastasia, \\"I.L. Caragiale orator »ôi om politic\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 6/2001 Fleva received most votes (1,223), and propelled his party into the top position. Nicolae N. Pa»õa, \\"Rezultatul alegerei de deputa»õi din CapitalƒÉ\\", in Democra»õia, Nr. 15-16/1908, p.27 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) After taking his seat, he returned to national attention, investigating cases of corruption cited against both of the major parties. In November 1911, he demanded an official scrutiny into the public contracts signed over by the new Petre P. Carp Conservative administration. He looked over Romanian Railways ledgers, investigated the collapse of Gala»õi docks, and exposed the (allegedly overpriced) works on NMS Regele Carol and NMS Rom√¢nia.Georgeta Filitti, \\"Rom√¢nia acum o sutƒÉ de ani\\", in Magazin Istoric, November 2011, p.61 Fleva was the first, and for long only, member of Parliament to note that VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu, the National Liberal Mayor of Bucharest, was in a conflict of interest. CƒÉtƒÉlin Fudulu, \\"Afaceri cu tramvaiele bucure»ôtene (V)\\", in Ziarul Financiar, January 20, 2010 The matter, which focused on how City Hall granted the contract for a new tramcar line, later exploded nationally as the \\"Tramcar Affair\\". By January 1912, Fleva's relationship with the Conservative-Democrats had turned into hostility. He quit the party, which had by then allied itself to the National Liberals, noting that Ionescu no longer stood for the initial goals: updating the 1866 Constitution and promoting land reform. A year later, a Conservative‚ÄîJunimist‚ÄîConservative-Democratic alliance was in power, with Titu Maiorescu as Prime Minister. Fleva took to the dissident Conservative club of Grigore G. Cantacuzino, which published the gazette Seara. This notoriously bawdy and violent paper was mounting a campaign against Interior Minister Alexandru BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu; Fleva joined in, with a claim that BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu was demented. Barbu Cioculescu, \\"Din via»õa lui Mateiu I. Caragiale: »òeful de cabinet\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 14/2001 The cause reunited Fleva with Bogdan-Pite»ôti, his 1899 rival, who had returned to public life as Searas editorial manager. In 1913, when Bogdan-Pite»ôti was taken to court by the financier Aristide Blank, Fleva headed the defense team. They lost, and Bogdan-Pite»ôti was found guilty of attempted blackmail.Rusu Abrudeanu, p.114 =World War I controversies and death= Fleva was again a member of the Assembly in the 1914 legislature. Immediately after the start of World War I, when Romania found itself in uncertain neutrality, he spoke from the Assembly rostrum as an advocate of the Entente Powers. At the time, he believed that fighting alongside the Entente, and therefore against Austria-Hungary, would guarantee Romania's integration of Transylvania and other irredenta: \\"our public, being a Latin people [...] could only have felt its interests as being at one with those of the Triple Entente [...]. We must not be looking on impassably to the fate of the Romanian nation in Transylvania, to how it is being torn asunder.\\" Radu Milian, \\"Dezbateri parlamentare »ôi de presƒÉ din Rom√¢nia √Æn perioada neutralitƒÉ»õii (1914‚Äì1916)\\", in Revista Crisia, Vol. XL, 2010, p.268 A failure to answer this call, he claimed, would have made his \\"the least worthy of all generations\\". As time progressed, Fleva became more sympathetic to the \\"Germanophile\\" camp, which pushed for committing Romania to the Central Powers (see Romania in World War I).Boia (2010), p.94; Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.124 The same course was maintained by Seara, managed at that stage by a consortium of businessmen from the German Empire. Diminea»õa daily, which had anti-German and pro-Entente sentiments, reported with pleasure that the Germans could not convince Fleva to take over as Searas editorial manager; its claims were partly backed by Fleva's own note, published in Dreptatea (November‚ÄìDecember 1914). Carmen Patricia Reneti, \\"Rela»õii rom√¢no-germane √Æn anul 1914\\", in Revista de Istorie MilitarƒÉ, Nr. 1-2/2010, p.38 Fleva reportedly received such offers from two German propagandists, Hilmar von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen and Josef B. Brociner. Not dignifying them with an answer, he even threw Brociner out in the street. Interviewed by AdevƒÉrul, he denounced Bussche's politics, and called off his bid.Rusu Abrudeanu, p.113 As his critics claim, Fleva's determination did not outlast the \\"morning dew\\": Bussche and his Romanian agent, the Slatina revolutionist-turned-Germanophile Bogdan-Pite»ôti, increased the stakes.Rusu Abrudeanu, p.113-114 In October 1915, Fleva signed on as \\"Political Director\\" of Libertatea (\\"Freedom\\"). Probably the second Germanophile tribune to be secretly financed by Bogdan- Pite»ôti, it was in fact edited by the young activist writers Tudor Arghezi and Gala Galaction.Boia (2010), p.94, 194 This sheet was mainly the voice of left- wing Germanophilia, maintaining that the need to enact social reforms was more pressing than any nationalist casus belli.Boia (2010), p.94 Although he resigned only a month into his assignment, Fleva still published with Libertatea until Romania declared war on Germany. From the pro-Entente camp, but also from among his own circles, accusations surfaced that Fleva had in fact become an agent of influence for the German Empire.Boia (2010), p.94, 194; Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.124-125; Rusu Abrudeanu, p.113-114, 116, 485 The Germanophile figure Ioan Bianu specifically noted that Fleva had received 100,000 lei from German intelligence before taking over at Libertatea (the information was probably backed by a 1916 official report, now lost, on the subversive activities of German oil investor Albert E. G√ºnther).Boia (2010), p.193-194 According to other sources, this was only a fraction of the sum promised to him by Bussche. In that account, Bussche allowed Fleva to humiliate himself, and withdrew the offer as soon as \\"the Tribune\\" fulfilled his part of the deal‚Äîa belated revenge for the AdevƒÉrul interview. Such allegations remain unproven, and, to his admirers, Fleva endured the incorruptible politician.Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.124-125 Fleva survived the war and the Central Powers' two-year-long occupation of southern Romania. He died on August 4, 1920, either in Jideni (now part of R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat)Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.122 or in Foc»ôani. He was by then noticeably poor, and largely forgotten by the general public.Gheorghe & »òerbu, p.124-125; Rusu Abrudeanu, p.112 Notes References *Constantin Bacalba»ôa, Bucure»ôtii de altƒÉdatƒÉ.

The grito‚Äîa joyous Mexican shout‚Äîopens the festivities every year. This festival is a shared heritage celebration between the two border cities of Matamoros, Tamaulipas and Brownsville, Texas. This festival is designed to enhance the spirit of Charro Days, and to add to the festivities. The Sombrero Festival is held in Washington Park in Brownsville, Texas. The Sombrero Festival was founded in Brownsville, TX, in 1986 by Danny Loff in order to enhance the spirit of Charro Days and to expand the activities available to the general public. The Sombrero Festival includes a jalape√±o-eating contest, 1-mile run/walk and a 5K run/walk, music and dancers, activities, numerous food stands and cooking contests. Several rock stars, corrido singers, and Tejano music entertainers perform in this annual event. During his campaign for President, Barack Obama made an unexpected visit to the Sombrero Festival in Brownsville, Texas, where he ate a Mexican torta, played games, and greeted voters. The event not only provides families with entertainment, but it also gives away money to charitable organizations and to fund public facilities in Brownsville, Texas. Mr. Amigo Association, an organization that works for the friendly relationship with Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico and Brownsville, Texas, United States and to preserve the Charro Days and Sombrero Festival celebrations, became a part of Charro Days in 1967. Sombrero Fest, a three-day Washington Park street party with popular rock, country and Tejano performers, was added in 1986. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the first president of the Mr. Amigo Association was the former president of Mexico, Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s. During the creation of NAFTA agreement in 1988-1989, Congressman Solomon Ortiz presented the Mr. Amigo Association with the Mr. Amigo Review Award for the distinction of being one of the first organizations to extend friendship and mutual understanding between the United States and Mexico. The Mr. Amigo Review Award remains on exhibit at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. as a model of bi-national friendliness between these two countries.

He was a member of the Tudor family of Penmynydd, Anglesey, North Wales, and a direct ancestor of Owen Tudor and thereby the Royal House of Tudor. He was a soldier for the English crown, who fought in the First War of Scottish Independence, including in the English invasion which led to the Battle of Bannockburn. He remained loyal to King Edward II of England until the king's death, and was both a yeoman and forester of Snowdon. After his death in 1331, his body was interned in Llanfaes Friary, near Bangor, Gwynedd. Ancestry and family Goronwy ap Tudur Hen was one of three sons of Welsh noble Tudur Hen (English: Tudur the Elder) and Anghared fil Ithel Fychan, alongside Madog ap Tudur Hen and Hywel ap Tudur Hen. Tudor Hen had first been in service to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also known as Llywelyn the Last), the King of Gwynedd, but retained his titles under the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England. But during the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn, Tudur acted as his steward. After the rebellion failed, Tudur pledged his loyalty to Edward. Utilising the more advantageous property laws of England, Tudur saw to it that his lands were passed seamlessly upon his death in 1311 into the hands of Goronwy. Service to the English crown Goronwy ap Tudur Hen was Lord of Penmynydd and a soldier in the service of the English crown. He joined King Edward II of England for his invasion of Scotland in 1314 as part of the First War of Scottish Independence, which included service at the Battle of Bannockburn in June of that year. In 1316, a rebellion took place in Glamorgan under the leadership of Llywelyn Bren, at the same time Edward was campaigning in Scotland. Despite this there was little concern that it would spread to North Wales, with the royal officials instead concerned with the threat of invasion from Ireland. Some 1,500 troops were summoned from the area to support the King, and among those leading those troops were Iorweth ap Gruffudd, Gruffudd Llwyd and his cousin Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. After these troops, under the command of Gruffudd Llwyd, moved to Chester, they were dismissed on 4 August 1316 to return to North Wales in order to protect the area from the Irish threat. Goronwy and his troops were again summoned into the King's service to retake Berwick in 1319, after Scottish forces had taken it a year earlier. The majority of the forces from Wales came from the southern Marcher Lords, but Goronwy, Gruffudd Llwyd and Hywel ap Gruffudd ap Geruath led those from the northern part of the country. Around the same time, as a yeoman of the king, Goronwy was made forester of Snowdon. He remained loyal to Edward II, but following the king's death, he resumed service to Edward III. Goronwy married Gwerful fil Madog, daughter of Madog ap Iorwerth, Baron Hendwr. Goronwy and Gwerful had three sons, Hywel ap Goronwy, Tudur ap Goronwy and Gruffydd ap Goronwy. Goronwy was interred after his death in the west wall of the Franciscan Llanfaes Friary near Bangor, Gwynedd on 11 December 1331. His father had overseen the reconstruction efforts of the friary, and in 1311 was the first of the family to be placed there following his death. Other members of the family were placed there following death, until some were moved following the Dissolution of the Monasteries under the Church of England imposed by King Henry VIII of England, with Goronwy's being moved to St Gredifael's Church, Penmynydd. Legacy Goronwy's eldest son Hywel ap Goronwy joined the priesthood, and became a canon of Bangor Cathedral. In 1357, Hywel became the Archdeacon of Anglesey. Gruffydd drowned in 1344. Goronwy ap Tudur Hen was one of the direct ancestors of the Royal House of Tudor. His son Tudur ap Goronwy became a knight in the service of Edward III, and was the grandfather of Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur (through his son Maredudd ap Tudur, grandson to Goronwy ap Tudur Hen). Owain Anglicised his name, becoming Owen Tudor, and was himself the grandfather of King Henry VII of England, the founder of the House of Tudor. =Lineage= Notes References   * (2 vols)  (2 vols in 4 parts) Category:1331 deaths Goronwy Category:Welsh soldiers Category:People from Anglesey Category:Year of birth unknown Category:14th-century Welsh people ","title":"Goronwy ap Tudur Hen"},{"id":"33652660","text":"Sanjoy Sen (born 12 December 1960) is a football manager who Currently work as the Head of Youth Development of Indian Super League side ATK Mohun Bagan.

Origins Born about 1310, he was one of the two sons of Goronwy ap Tudur Hen and his wife Gwerfyl ferch Madog. His father had fought for King Edward I of England and had stayed loyal to King Edward II of England. On his father's death in 1331, he inherited the family lands which had passed down from his grandfather Tudur Hen and lived in the village of Trecastell. His brother and ally, Hywel ap Goronwy (died about 1366), joined the priesthood, becoming a canon of Bangor Cathedral, and eventually Archdeacon of Anglesey. Career He was a royal officer for the island of Anglesey, and served in the English army of King Edward III of England during the campaigns in France in 1337. In 1345 he and his brother Hywel were involved in a prominent murder case, probably the result of local unrest. Henry Shalford, newly appointed as the Prince of Wales' representative in North Wales, was attacked and killed near Hywel's house in Bangor by a band of men led by Tudur. One report suggested that Shalford knew too much about malpractice among leading Welshmen.J. G. Edwards, ed., Calendar of Ancient Correspondence Concerning Wales, 1935, 233 The result was panic among the English inhabitants of the area and suspicion of the Welsh community. Both brothers were arrested and placed in custody, with Hywel held at Launceston in Cornwall and Tudur in Chester, but both were eventually released without charge or penalty. This led to complaints by English residents that \\"no Welsh man dare indict them\\" because of their local influence. Gruffydd ap Maredudd ap Dafydd suggested that the brothers were as strong as oak trees and protected all those under their branches. In 1352, both were in peaceful possession of their ancestral lands in Anglesey. Tudur was buried in the south wall of the chancel at the Franciscan friary of Llanfaes near Bangor, Gwynedd. The bodies of his ancestors were nearby, in the south wall of the chapel. The bard Iolo Goch composed an elegy to him. Family The Welsh genealogies show Tudur ap Goronwy marrying twice, to Mallt ferch Madog, daughter of Madog ap Iorwerth, and to Marged ferch Tomos, daughter of Tomos ap Llewelyn and aunt of rebel Owain Glynd≈µr, and having six sons:; ; :Goronwy ap Tudur :Rhys ap Tudur (by Mallt) :Ednyfed ap Tudur :Gwilym ap Tudur :Rhys ap Tudur (by Marged) :Maredudd ap Tudur All rose to positions of power locally on Anglesey and in the adjoining areas of North Wales.

Currently, Kumar Mangalam Birla is chancellor and Shobhana Bhartia is pro-chancellor. The first academic head of the institution was J. C. Stracliff (Principal) and V. Lakshminarayanan (Vice- Principal) for a period of 3 years during 1946‚Äì1949. V. Lakshminarayan became Principal of Birla Engineering College in 1949 (served from 1946 to 1963 in Birla Engineering College), then becoming the first Director of BITS-Pilani in 1964 when it was formed and served till 1969. He was succeeded by BITS directors C.R. Mitra (1969‚Äì1989) and S. Venkateswaran (1989‚Äì2006). \\"director\\" denoted the head of a campus. Under Prof S. Venkateswaran's leadership, the University grew significantly. He was instrumental in expanding BITS, Pilani to establish the other 3 campuses in Goa, Dubai and Hyderabad. With the advent of multiple campuses, the overall head was known as \\"vice-chancellor\\"; As a result, Dr. Venkateswaran became the first Vice Chancellor leading all campuses in 2001. After his retirement, Prof. L.K. Maheshwari became the second Vice Chancellor in 2006 and kept office till 2010 when he was succeeded by Prof. Bijendra Nath Jain who held office till 2015. The director of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus, Prof. VS Rao took over in August 2015 as the 'Acting Vice chancellor' while the search was on for a suitable candidate to hold the top post in BITS Pilani.

He took over in June 2016 to become the 6th academic head of the institute.  Admission  = Pilani, Goa and Hyderabad campuses = Before 2005, admissions were based on the candidates' score in the 12th board examination. Earlier many students used to switch to State board schools for their 12th standard, in order to grab more marks easily and gain admission at BITS pilani. BITS had been moderating marks from various school boards since 1982. Since 2005, admission to BITS has been offered on the basis of the student's performance in the all-India entrance examination, the Birla Institute of Technology and Science Admission Test (BITSAT). For foreign students, BITS has a separate admission scheme called International Student Admissions (ISA) category. To gauge the merit of these ISA students, BITS accepts the SAT and SAT Subject Tests in chemistry, physics, and Math 2C. BITSAT, for which applications are submitted in December, is conducted online in May and June in cities all over India. The exam tests the candidate's knowledge, reasoning and analytical abilities in physics, chemistry, mathematics, English and logical reasoning, and is based on higher secondary curricula in India and abroad.

He was one of three sons of Goronwy ab Ednyfed who received lands from King Edward I of England. Nonetheless, he backed the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn, but afterwards swore allegiance to both Edward I and his son, Edward of Caernarfon. Tudur Hen was responsible for the restoration of the Franciscan friary at Bangor, where his body was later placed on 11 October 1311. Ancestry and family His father Goronwy ab Ednyfed (d. 1268) was seneschal to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also known as Llywelyn the Last), the King of Gwynedd by 1258, continuing in the role until his death on 12 October 1268. In that role, Goronwy had followed in the footsteps of his father, Ednyfed Fychan, and by doing so had tied the fortunes of the early House of Tudor to those of Llywelyn. Goronwy led Llywelyn's military forces, and in February 1263 he took them as far south as Gwent in action against the Marcher Lords. Tudur ap Goronwy was one of three sons of Goronwy ab Ednyfed, alongside Goronwy ap Goronwy (also known as Goronwy the Younger or Goronwy Fychan) and Hywel ap Goronwy. Tudur Hen was not the first member of the family to be named Tudur: he was preceded by his uncle, Tudur ab Ednyfed, who had been in the service of the previous Prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Llywelyn. Service to the English crown and rebellion In September 1278, King Edward I of England granted lands to Tudur and his brothers. The majority of the noble houses in Wales sided with the Welsh forces during the English invasion of Gwynedd, but Edward proclaimed that any who joined him would retain their lands and titles under the English crown. Tudur Hen retained his prestige and lands after the death of Llywelyn in 1282 and the victory of the English. Tudur and his brother Goronwy were two of those lords who backed the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn against the English in 1294‚Äì95. Tudur acted as steward to Madog, while Goronwy was in his service. Tudur and Goronwy were two of three men who witnessed the Madog's charter, known as the Penmachno Document, in 1294 which granted lands in Ardudwy and Llansannan to Bleddyn Fychan. After the revolt failed, Tudur was among those lords from North Wales who pledged their loyalty to Edward in person in 1296, and again to Edward of Caernarfon when he was invested as Prince of Wales in 1301. Tudur Hen has since the 18th century been historically credited with the construction of the Franciscan Llanfaes Friary near Bangor, but it has since been discovered that the building pre-dated him. However, since the friary sided with Edward in the two Welsh wars since the original construction, it has been proposed that Tudur was responsible for rebuilding the site around 1293 after it was damaged. He arranged to be interred in the south wall of the site. He acted as an official representative for the English Royal Family in the Perfeddwlad territories. Tudur used the English property laws, which he found more advantageous in his position than those used by the Welsh, as they allowed for inheritance of lands by a single party. He continued to hold the lands in North Wales and Cardiganshire which he had inherited. Upon his death in 1311, his holdings passed to his son Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. He had two further sons, Madog and Hywel. Tudur Hen was interned in Bangor Priory on 11 October 1311; his son, Goronwy, was also placed there on 11 December 1331 following his death. Legacy One of the earliest works by the bard Iolo Goch was based on Tudur Hen; Iolo may have studied at the Bangor Priory. Tudur Hen's most significant legacy was his name. The naming practice of the time in Wales was to attach the father's name to the new first name, thus his son was named Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. Goronwy had children, one of whom was named Tudur, becoming another Tudur ap Goronwy. The younger Tudur was noticed by King Edward III of England and was made a knight in his service, and he was the grandfather (through Maredudd ap Tudur) of Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur. Owain anglicised his name to become Owen Tudor, and was the grandfather of King Henry VII of England, the founder of the Royal House of Tudor. =Lineage= References References   * Category:Welsh soldiers Category:People from Anglesey Category:1311 deaths Category:House of Tudor Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Welsh Roman Catholics Category:13th- century Welsh people Category:14th-century Welsh people ","title":"Tudur Hen"},{"id":"33652812","text":"Bhuvad or Bhuwad is a village in Anjar Taluka of Kutch district of Gujarat, India.

The original Comvik operation is the predecessor to two listed companies: Tele2 and Millicom. Comvik An example of the aggressive advertising of \\"David and Goliath style\\" that Comvik used against the state monopoly to justify its existence The original Comvik was established in 1981 in an attempt to break the existing de facto state- sanctioned telecommunications monopoly held by Televerket at the time. During the 1980s, investor Jan Stenbeck's strategy was to pursue, break up and create alternatives to the existing Swedish monopolies in service sectors including telephony and media. In the late 1970s, Mr Stenbeck's Investment AB Kinnevik started to buy a number of smaller companies in Stockholm and Gothenburg that operated manual communication networks for car based equipment. Through an operator the driver could reach the public telephone network. Eventually these companies were merged and rebranded as AB F√∂retagstelefon in Stockholm. In parallel ‚Äì and in the quiet ‚Äì the plans were more ambitious. Completely new equipment was purchased, new telephone terminals were developed and then on 1 July 1981 Comvik launched Sweden's first automatic analogue mobile telephony network, three months ahead of Televerket's launch of its NMT network. Since Televerket had a monopoly on telecommunications and the radio spectrum, a conflict arose between Televerket and Comvik. After many very public arguments where Televerket even threatened to disconnect Comvik from the public telephone network, the then-non-socialist government gave Comvik permission to continue and expand to a limited extent. Comvik asked for and got a few more frequencies. Finally Comvik had 27 frequencies. Televerkets NMT system had 180 frequencies. Comvik had to expand into cell-based technology that today forms the basis of mobile telephony. The Swedish-based Ericsson sold no equipment to Comvik who instead had to develop the technology themselves using a mixture of suppliers. Comvik built up a customer base of 20,000 subscribers. In order to compete with Televerket they had a lower per-minute rate and offered free calls on evenings and weekends. Comvik also launched several value added services aiming at small businesses. Comvik received the ‚ÄúService Company of the Year‚Äù award by the Swedish business newspaper Dagens Industri in 1987 on the grounds that Comvik broke up the existing monopoly and introduced customer choice. Because of the competitive situation, it was difficult to operate. There were no additional frequencies available, the customer base could not be increased and the company suffered heavy losses. However, with the stoic attitude and changing public attitudes versus monopolies, Comvik was finally awarded a formal GSM license in 1988 to be operated in competition with Televerket. =Comvik International= With the help from its Comvik experience Kinnevik also acquired mobile licenses around the globe and initially used the ‚ÄúComvik International‚Äù moniker. Networks were built in Hong Kong, Vietnam (Mobifone), Mauritius (Emtel) and other countries. Those activities later became the founding pillars of Millicom International Cellular, of which the latter now primarily operates in various African and South American countries under the Tigo brand name. Recent history In 1991, Kinnevik branded its new GSM network as ‚ÄúComviq‚Äù and said network was finally launched the following year. The old Comvik name was retained for the parallel-operating analog network for another few years before it was phased out. Comviq GSM merged with Tele2 in 1997, but the name Comviq was retained as a brand, together with Tele2's own brand Tele2 Mobile. In 2004 name was changed to Tele2Comviq. In 2007 the brand was completely replaced by Tele2 brand. In 1997, the mother company introduced Comviq Kontant as the first prepaid card in Sweden. Despite Tele2Comviq being dropped for GSM, the Comviq name was retained for the prepaid cards with a new logo and design introduced to distinguish it as a debit card. In 2009 the Comviq brand was re-launched again as a very price competitive and simplistic prepaid SIM card brand, also now including fixed-priced, no binding contract postpaid subscription plans. Nowadays, Comviq operates on 2G and 4G LTE on the Net4Mobility network which is also shared with Tele2 and Telenor Sverige, as well as on 3G UMTS on the SUNAB network which is also shared with Tele2 and Telia.

Goronwy was the founder of the Tudor family of Penmynydd. Early life and service to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd Goronwy ab Ednyfed was one of the sons of Ednyfed Fychan (died 1246), seneschal to Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Wales. Goronwy's mother, Gwenllian, was daughter of Rhys ap Gruffydd. When Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Llywelyn the Last) rose to power in the Kingdom of Gwynedd, he brought all three of Ednyfed's sons into his service. By 1258, Llywelyn had styled himself the Prince of Wales, the same year that Goronwy had been established as his seneschal. Goronwy continued in this role for the following ten years, during which time he was involved in a variety of negotiations with the Marcher Lords, with Richard, the Bishop of Bangor, and with several other Welsh princes. Goronwy led Llywelyn's troops as far south as Gwent to combat the Marcher Lords in February 1263. He died on 17 October 1268, and was remembered by Welsh chroniclers for his wisdom and integrity as well as his ability in arms. It is possible that Goronwy's name appears in a list of witnesses to a contract of Llywelyn the Great as early as 1222. Thus it is likely that he had served as a court official together with his father before succeeding him as seneschal of Gwynedd on his death in 1246, or in the years between 1222 and 1258. A single source tells us that another son of Ednyfed, Gruffudd, was seneschal of Gwynedd from 1246 to 1256. Thus there is some doubt about tha succession in that period. It is known with certainty that he was a witness to documents relating to Gwynedd between 1258 and 1268, under Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. As seneschal, he led a powerful force together with Maredudd ap Rhys, Rhys Fychan, and Maredudd ab Owain of Deheubarth (blood relations to Goronwy) against the Normans of Gwent and the forces of the king of England there in March 1263. The last reference to him in official documents is as an arbitrator between Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Gilbert de Clare after a raid by Llywelyn on Morgannwg; it is dated 27 September 1268. Goronwy had land from his father in Anglesey, Arllechwedd and Ceredigion. Goronwy died on St Luke's Eve, 17 October 1268, according to the Brut y Tywysogion: \\"The following year Goronw son of Ednyfed, seneschal to the prince, died on the eve of St Luke the Evangelist, a man excellent in arms, generous with gifts, wise in counsel, loyal in deeds, and pleasant in words.\\" The bard Y Prydydd Bychan composed an elegy to him. The text is very incomplete and adds very little to our knowledge of him. Another bard, Bleddyn Fardd, composed another elegy to him, which refers to the raid on Gwent and the losses which followed. His death so soon after the hostilities in Gwent suggests that he was wounded there, but there is no proof of this. Legacy By founding the Tudor family of Penmynydd, Goronwy began a lineage which came to include kings and queens of England. The name of his son Tudur Hen became the family surname: a second Tudur ap Goronwy was knighted by King Edward III of England; his name was passed down two further generations to Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur, who anglicised it to become Owen Tudor. Owen was the grandfather of Henry Tudor, who became King Henry VII of England and founded the royal House of Tudor. =Lineage= Notes References * * Category:Welsh soldiers Category:People from Anglesey Category:1268 deaths Category:House of Tudor Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Goronwy ab Ednyfed"},{"id":"33652968","text":"Summit cross on the Gro√üer Gegenstein The Gegensteine are crags near the town of Ballenstedt on the northern edge of the Harz Mountains in Germany.

Life According to Gillian Darley, Rand's father was a physician at Wotton, Surrey, connected to the Evelyn family. William Rand studied medicine at the University of Louvain.Gillian Darley, John Evelyn: Living for ingenuity (2006), p. 146‚Äì7. It has been suggested also, by Charles Webster, that he was a Cambridge graduate, and son of the apothecary James Rand, matching him rather tentatively to the William Rand who matriculated at Catharine Hall, Cambridge in 1633; this Rand studied at the University of Leiden, though was MD of another institution.Charles Webster, The Great Instauration: science, medicine and reform, 1626‚Äì1660 (1976), p. 301.

Cook, Practical Medicine and the British Armed Forces after the \\"Glorious Revolution\\", Medical History (1990), 34, pp. 1‚Äì26; Online, p. 15 of PDF. In 1652 he addressed thoughts to Samuel Hartlib on reform of the book trade. Natural philosophers found it difficult to get into print, and booksellers were rapacious. Rand suggested a way round the stationers' monopoly, with a system of scholarly licensing.John Barnard, Donald Francis McKenziep, The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain: 1557‚Äì1695 (2002), p. 298; Google Books.Roy Porter, Katharine Park, Lorraine Daston, The Cambridge History of Science: Early modern science (2004), p. 328; Google Books. In 1656 he contributed to the programme of Hartlib and Robert Boyle for the reform of science, advocating the establishment of a College of Graduate Physicians.Charles Webster, Samuel Hartlib and the Advancement of Learning (2010), p. 59; Google Books. The project had the support of Katherine Jones, Viscountess Ranelagh, who was Boyle's sister. A proposal for a Society of Chemical Physicians of the 1660s, again Helmontian in attitude, for a while gathered some momentum.Peter Elmer, The Healing Arts: health, disease and society in Europe, 1500‚Äì1800 (2006), p. 129; Google Books. Charles Webster has argued for some continuity from Rand's group to the 1665 group behind the Society of Chemical Physicians; but the latter had notable court patronage too placing it in a very different part of the political spectrum, as well as being open to those without medical degrees.Harold J. Cook, The Society of Chemical Physicians, the New Philosophy, and the Restoration Court, Bulletin of the History of Medicine (1987), 61, pp. 61‚Äì77; Online, at p. 62. Works The W.

Views Rand's views are available in correspondence, with Hartlib and others. He was an admirer of Machiavelli. Rand expressed admiration also for Thomas Hobbes in a letter to Hartlib in 1651, finding in him a Protestant comparable in creative ideas to the Catholic Kenelm Digby.Quentin Skinner, Visions of Politics Volume 3 (2002), p. 274; Google Books. Rand also thought Hobbes a royalist,Nicholas D.

Hartlib would include Rand's name in a list for a \\"council for schooling\\", with John Milton and others.Hill, pp. 146‚Äì7; the list included also John Dury, John Pell, Marchamont Nedham, Moses Wall, and Israel Tonge.

In Technical diving where breathing gas mixtures known as Trimix comprising oxygen, helium and nitrogen are used, it is necessary to know the fraction of helium in the mixture to reliably calculate decompression schedules for dives using that mixture. Thermal conductivity principle Portable instruments for the analysis of helium content of breathing gas mixtures may be based on a thermal conductivity sensor (katharometer). These sensors can be very stable and maintenance free and also highly reliable and accurate.Thermal Conductivity Sensors A typical thermal helium analyser comprises two chambers, each with an identical thermal conductivity sensor. One chamber is sealed and is filled with pure helium as the reference gas, and the other receives the sample gas. The difference in thermal conductivity of the reference and sample gases is measured and converted into a concentration value by the electronic circuitry in the instrument. The system is inherently stable and when precise temperature compensation is made, the system is more than adequately accurate for breathing gas analysis. Accuracy and display precision is typically within 0.1%, and accuracy within 1% is considered sufficient for most decompression algorithms. The thermal conductivity of nitrogen and oxygen are very similar, and that of helium very different so that the ratio of oxygen and nitrogen in the mix is relatively unimportant, and need not be compensated. This allows a direct reading of helium fraction from these instruments. However, for greater accuracy and compensation to oxygen cross-sensitivity, some instruments include an oxygen cell, and in these cases can generally give a full helium and oxygen analysis of the mixture simultaneously.ANALOX 8000 ‚Äì Helium Analyse User Manual, Analox Sensor Technology Ltd, 15 Ellerbeck Court, Stokesley Business Park, North Yorkshire, TS9 5PT, Speed of sound principle Helium content may also be determined on the basis of measuring the speed of sound in the analyzed gas mixture. The speed of sound depends on the mixture of gases and the temperature of the mix; in the analysis of trimix the speed of sound can be described by a non-linear function of temperature, oxygen content and helium content, and thus the content of helium can be determined by measuring the speed of sound through the mix, the temperature of the mix and its oxygen content.

She sailed on 5 December for Newport, Monmouthshire, arriving the next day. In 1946, Empire Falkland was sold to the Scottish Shire Line Ltd, Glasgow and renamed Stirlingshire. She was operated under the management of Turnbull, Martin & Co Ltd. On 5 September 1946, Stirlingshire departed from Melbourne, Australia with a cargo that included 6,000 tons of foodstuffs, including beef, butter, eggs, lamb, meat sundries and turkeys, as well as a cargo of wool, which was carried above deck to make room for the meat. She was to sail to Liverpool via the Suez Canal, with an expected arrival in mid-October. In 1960, Stirlingshire was sold to Houston Line Ltd. On 22 November 1961, Stirlingshire collided with the Danish Lily Nielsen at Durban, South Africa. Lily Nielsen then collided with the South African Sherwood. Her departure was delayed whilst the damage was inspected. She served until 1966, arriving at Bruges, Belgium on 2 September for scrapping.

Union-Flugzeugwerke  Founded in 1912, the Union-Flugzeugwerke G.m.b.H. was founded at Teltow near Berlin by Karl Bomhard, who had previously participated in the design of the Lohner arrow-biplanes (Pfeilflieger) in Austria. Joined by Dr. Josef Sablatnig and Georg Konig, the Union Flugzeugbau constructed the Union arrow-biplanes based on Bomhard's designs form his time at Lohner. One of these aircraft won three world-altitude records with passengers for Germany in 1913. Union G.I development Union engineers Baurat Rittberger and Karl Schopper began the design of a large four-engined bomber in 1914, classified in the Grossflugzeug category because the engines could not be serviced in flight. Constructed of wood with fabric covering, (some parts may have been plywood covered) and wire bracing. The tail unit comprised a single tailplane with elevator with a single fin carrying a rudder and two auxiliary rudders at approx half tailplane span. At the successful Idflieg inspection on 13 April 1915, the airframe construction was described as good but the low cruising and maximum speeds were criticised as well as the disappointing useful load. Flight trials began in May 1915 but the first G.I was damaged and there is no evidence of further flying. The second G.I named \\"Marga-Emmy\\" was ordered by Daimler to allow them to rapidly enter the aircraft market. The strengthened second G.I, stationed at Schneidemuhl, flew soon after but was destroyed just before landing on 1 September 1915 after experiencing extreme vibrations from the engines during flight. Development continued as the Daimler R.I but on 1 August 1916 the Union-Flugzeugwerke went into liquidation and its assets were taken over by the Norddeutsche Flugzeugwerke, which spent the remainder of the war years repairing aircraft.

They may be used with liquids or gases, but the construction details will vary depending on the fluid. A gas booster is similar to a gas compressor, but generally a simpler mechanism which often has only a single stage of compression, and is used to increase pressure of a gas already above ambient pressure. Two-stage boosters are also made. Boosters may be used for increasing gas pressure, transferring high pressure gas, charging gas cylinders and scavenging. Water pressure On new construction and retrofit projects, water pressure booster pumps are used to provide adequate water pressure to upper floors of high rise buildings. The need for a water pressure booster pump can also arise after the installation of a backflow prevention device (BFP), which is currently mandated in many municipalities to protect the public water supplies from contaminants within a building entering the public water supply. The use of BFPs began after The Clean Water Act was passed. These devices can cause a loss of 12 PSI, and can cause flushometers on upper floors not to work properly. After pipes have been in service for an extended period, scale can build up on the inside surfaces which will cause a pressure drop when the water flows. =Water pressure booster construction and function= Booster pumps for household water pressure are usually simple electrically driven centrifugal pumps with a non-return valve. They may be constant speed pumps which switch on when pressure drops below the low pressure set-point and switch off when pressure reaches the high set-point, or variable speed pumps which are controlled to maintain a constant output pressure. Constant speed pumps are switched on by a normally closed low-pressure switch and will content to run until the pressure rises to open the high pressure switch. They will cycle whenever enough water is used to cause a pressure drop below the low set point. An accumulator in the upstream pipeline will reduce cycling. Variable speed pumps use pressure feedback to electronically control motor speed to maintain a reasonably constant discharge pressure. Most applications run off AC mains current and use an inverter to control motor speed. Installations that provide water to highrise buildings may need boosters at several levels to provide acceptably consistent pressure on all floors. In such a case independent boosters may be installed at various levels, each boosting the pressure provided by the next lower level. It is also possible to boost once to the maximum pressure required, and then to use a pressure reducer at each level. This method would be used if there is a holding tank on the roof with gravity feed to the supply system. Gas pressure Principle of a gas booster pump used to increase pressure of a compressed air supply Gas pressure boosting may be used to fill storage cylinders to a higher pressure than the available gas supply, or to provide production gas at pressure higher than line pressure. Examples include: * Breathing gas blending for underwater diving where the gas is to be supplied from high-pressure cylinders, as in scuba, scuba replacement and surface-supplied mixed gas diving, where the component gases are blended by partial pressure addition to the storage cylinders, and the mixture storage pressure may be higher than the available pressure of the components. * Helium reclaim systems, where the heliox breathing gas exhaled by a saturation diver is piped back to the surface, oxygen is added to make up the required composition, and the gas is boosted to the appropriate supply pressure, filtered, scrubbed of carbon dioxide, and returned to the gas distribution panel to be supplied to the diver again. * Workshop compressed air is usually provided at a pressure suited to the majority of the applications, but some may need a higher pressure. A small booster can be effective to provide this air. =Gas booster construction and function= Schematic diagram of pneumatic powered gas booster types. Top to bottom: Single stage, single action; single stage double action; two stage double action. Gas booster pumps are usually piston or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, single-stage booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed to withstand the operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into the space between the cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalized, taking valve opening pressures into account. Once the flow has stopped, the booster is started, and as the piston withdraws along the cylinder, increasing the volume between the cylinder head and the piston crown, the pressure in the cylinder will drop, and gas will flow in from the inlet port. On the return cycle, the piston moves toward the cylinder head, decreasing the volume of the space and compressing the gas until the pressure is sufficient to overcome the pressure in the outlet line and the opening pressure of the outlet valve. At that point, the gas will flow out of the cylinder via the outlet valve and port. There will always be some compressed gas remaining in the cylinder and cylinder head spaces at the top of the stroke. The gas in this \\"dead space\\" will expand during the next induction stroke, and only after it has dropped below the supply gas pressure, more supply gas will flow into the cylinder. The ratio of the volume of the cylinder space with the piston fully withdrawn, to the dead space, is the \\"compression ratio\\" of the booster, also termed \\"boost ratio\\" in this context. Efficiency of the booster is related to the compression ratio, and gas will only be transferred while the pressure ratio between supply and discharge gas is less than the boost ratio, and delivery rate will drop as the inlet to delivery pressure ratio increases. Delivery rate starts at very close to swept volume when there is no pressure difference, and drops steadily until there is no effective transfer when the pressure ratio reaches the maximum boost ratio. Compression of gas will cause a rise in temperature. The heat is mostly carried out by the compressed gas, but the booster components will also be heated by contact with the hot gas. Some boosters are cooled by water jackets or external fins to increase convectional cooling by the ambient air, but smaller models may have no special cooling facilities at all. Cooling arrangements will improve efficiency, but will cost more to manufacture. Boosters to be used with oxygen must be made from oxygen-compatible materials, and use oxygen-compatible lubricants to avoid fire. =Configurations= *Single stage, single acting: There is one booster cylinder, which pressurises gas in one direction of piston movement, and refills the cylinder on the return stroke. *Single stage, double acting: There are two booster cylinders, which operate alternately, with each one pressurising gas while the other is refilling. The cylinders each pressurise gas fed directly from the supply, and the delivered gas from each is combined at the outlets. The cinders work in parallel and have the same bore. *Two stage, double acting: There are two cylinders, which operate alternately, each pressurising gas while the other is refilling, but the second stage has a smaller bore and is filled by the gas pressurised by the first stage, and it pressurises the gas further. The stages operate in series, and the gas passes though both of them in turn. Power sources Small air powered portable high pressure breathing gas booster pump Gas boosters may be driven by an electric motor, hydraulics, low or high pressure air or manually by a lever system. =Compressed air= Those powered by compressed air are usually linear actuated systems, where a pneumatic cylinder directly drives the compression piston, often in a common housing, separated by one or more seals. A high pressure pneumatic drive arrangement may use the same pressure as the output pressure to drive the piston, and a low pressure drive will use a larger diameter piston to multiply the applied force. Low pressure air A common arrangement for low pressure air powered boosters is for the booster pistons to be direct coupled with the drive piston, on the same centreline. The low pressure cylinder has a considerably larger section area than the high pressure cylinders, in proportion to the pressure ratio between the drive and boosted gas. A single action booster of this type has a boost cylinder on one end of the power cylinder, and a double action booster has a boost cylinder on each end of the power cylinder, and the piston rod has a drive piston in the middle and a booster piston on each end. Oxygen boosters require some design features which may not be necessary in boosters for less reactive gases. It is necessary to ensure that drive air, which may not be sufficiently clean for safe contact with high pressure oxygen, cannot leak past the seals into the booster cylinder, or high pressure oxygen can not leak ito the drive cylinder. This can be done by providing a space between the low pressure cylinder and high pressure cylinder that is vented to atmosphere, and the piston rod is sealed on each side where it passes through this space. Any gas leaks from either cylinder past the rod seals escapes harmlessly into the ambient air. A special case for gas powered boosters is where the booster uses the same gas supply to power the booster and as the gas to be boosted. This arrangement is wasteful of gas and is most suitable for use to provide small quantities of higher pressure air where large quantities of lower pressure air are already available. This system is sometimes known as a \\"bootstrap\\" booster. =High pressure= =Electrical= Schematic diagram of double action single stage gas booster with electric drive Back view of Russian oxygen booster pump End view of Russian oxygen booster pump Electrically powered boosters may use a single or three-phase AC motor drive. The high speed rotational output of the motor must be converted to lower speed reciprocating motion of the pistons. One way this has been done (Dr√§ger and Russian KN-3 and KN-4 military boosters) is to connect the motor to a worm drive gearbox with an eccentric output shaft driving a connecting rod which drives the double-ended piston via a central trunnion. This system is well suited to a double acting booster, either with single-stage boost by parallel connected cylinders with the same bore, or two-stage cylinders of different bores connected in series. Some of these boosters allow for the connecting rod to be disconnected and a pair of long levers to be fitted for manual operation in emergencies or where electrical power is not available. =Manual= Schematic diagram of double action single stage gas booster with manual lever operation Manual boosters have been made with the configuration described above, either with a single vertical lever or with a seesaw styled double ended horizontal lever, and also with two parallel vertically mounted cylinders, much like the lever-operated diver's air pumps used for the early standard diving dress but with much smaller bore to allow two operators to generate high pressures. Manufacturers High pressure gas boosters are manufactured by Haskel, MPS Technology, Dr√§ger and others. Rugged and unsophisticated models (KN-3 and KN-4) were manufactured for the Soviet Armed Forces and surplus examples are now used by technical divers as they are relatively inexpensive and are supplied with a comprehensive spares and tool kit.

Early life Muhammad Hasan was born on April 4, 1906 as Teuku Sarong, into an aristocratic family in Sigli, Aceh. His father, Teuku Bintara Pineung Ibrahim was an Ul√®√´ Balang in Pidie (Ul√®√´ Balang was an aristocratic class in Aceh who led a district). He went to Volksschool (Common School) in Lampoeh Saka from 1914-1917. In 1924 he studied at Dutch-language Europeesche Lagere School (RLS), After graduating in 1924, he studied at Koningin Wilhelmina School (KWS) in Batavia (now Jakarta). Then attended Rechtshoogeschool (Law High School). Time in the Netherlands He decided to go to the Netherlands when he was 25 years old, studying Law at Leiden University. During his time in Netherlands, he joined Indonesian student organization Perhimpunan Indonesia and became an independence activist with another Indonesian students like Mohammad Hatta and Sutan Sjahrir. He graduated as (Master of Laws) in 1933. Independence struggle Teuku Muhammad Hasan returned to Indonesia, and landed in Ul√®√´ Lheu√´ Sea Port, Kutaradja (now Banda Aceh) in 1934. He was suspected by the Dutch authorities for bringing issues about Indonesian independence movement, and took all his books and other possession. He was active in an Islamic organization Muhammadiyah and education. During this era, they made schools and the woman branch of the organization, Aisyiah. His other education activity was establishing Perguruan Taman Siswa Aceh Chapter in Kutaraja, in 11 Juli 1937. Served as chairman, and with Teuku Nyak Arif as secretary. He made a scholarship foundation Atjehsche Studiefonds (Aceh Students Foundation) for supporting prospective but poor students. He also chaired 'Perkumpulan Usaha Sama Akan Kemajuan Anak (Mutual Struggle Association for Children Development, or abbreviated as PUSAKA) with aim to build a school similar to Dutch's Holland Inlandsche School. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (1942 - 1945) , he was the chairman of Koperasi Ladang Pegawai Negeri (Field Cooperative for the Civil Servants) in Medan He was a member of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence on August 7, 1945, as the continuation from Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence. This body was chaired by Sukarno, who declared Indonesian independence on August 17, 1945, two days after Japan surrendered to the Allied Forces at the end of the Pacific War. Governor of Sumatra He was appointed by the new created Republic of Indonesia Government as the first Governor of Sumatra on August 22, 1945. Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia In December 1948, the Dutch launched their second \\"Police Action\\" and focused their attack on Yogyakarta. Sukarno and Hatta, instead of running away to fight guerrilla warfare chose to remain in the city and were arrested. Hearing the president was arrested, Mr Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, the Minister of Welfare, who was in Bukit Tinggi met Mr. Teuku Muhammad Hasan/Governor of Sumatera and Colonel Hidayat, Commander of Army and Territory of Sumatera on December 19, 1948. and established Government in Exile dubbed Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI), on December 22, 1948, in Bukittinggi, Sumatra. Sjafruddin served as chairman of the emergency cabinet Mr. Teuku Muhammad Hasan was appointed as Deputy Chairman of PDRI, Minister of Home Affairs, Education & Culture and Religious Affairs ad interim.TEUKU MUHAMMAD HASAN MENTERI PENDIDIKAN ‚ÄùDARURAT The leaders of the PDRI moved around West Sumatra in an effort to evade arrest by the Dutch who wanted to abolish the PDRI. In 1949 the PDRI government contacted the leaders of Indonesian forces in Java and the six Republic of Indonesia government ministers in Java who had escaped arrest. Based on the Roem‚ÄìVan Roijen Agreement, on July 13, 1949, Dutch troops were to be pulled out from Republic of Indonesia regions and the Republic of Indonesia leaders were to be freed. The PDRI would therefore no longer be required, and Mr. Sjafruddin Prawiranegara disbanded the PDRI and returned the mandate to the President of RI. Oil companies nationalization In 1951, as the chairman of Trading and Industry Commission of DPRS (People's Representative Council), he recommended Oil Companies Nationalization in Indonesia and other mining companies. His motion was accepted on August 2, 1951. This motion resulted nationalization some Dutch Oil Companies into Permina (1957) and Pertamin (1961). Both companies were merged in 1968 as Pertamina. Later life Mr. Teuku Muhammad Hasan established Serambi Mekkah University in Banda Aceh, and writing books.

Weak sustainability is an idea within environmental economics which states that 'human capital' can substitute 'natural capital'. It is based upon the work of Nobel Laureate Robert Solow, and John Hartwick. Contrary to weak sustainability, strong sustainability assumes that \\"human capital\\" and \\"natural capital\\" are complementary, but not interchangeable. This idea received more political attention as sustainable development discussions evolved in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A key landmark was the Rio Summit in 1992 where the vast majority of nation-states committed themselves to sustainable development. This commitment was demonstrated by the signing of Agenda 21, a global action plan on sustainable development. Weak sustainability has been defined using concepts like human capital and natural capital. Human (or produced) capital incorporates resources such as infrastructure, labour and knowledge. Natural capital covers the stock of environmental assets such as fossil fuels, biodiversity and other ecosystem structures and functions relevant for ecosystem services. In very weak sustainability, the overall stock of man-made capital and natural capital remains constant over time. It is important to note that, unconditional substitution between the various kinds of capital is allowed within weak sustainability. This means that natural resources may decline as long as human capital is increased. Examples include the degradation of the ozone layer, tropical forests and coral reefs if accompanied by benefits to human capital. An example of the benefit to human capital could include increased financial profits. If capital is left constant over time intergenerational equity, and thus Sustainable Development, is achieved. An example of weak sustainability could be mining coal and using it for production of electricity. The natural resource coal, is replaced by a manufactured good which is electricity. The electricity is then in turn used to improve domestic life quality (e.g. cooking, lighting, heating, refrigeration and operating boreholes to supply water in some villages) and for industrial purposes (growing the economy by producing other resources using machines that are electricity operated.) Case studies of weak sustainability in practice have had both positive and negative results. The concept of weak sustainability still attracts a lot of criticism. Some even suggest that the concept of sustainability is redundant. Other approaches are advocated, including ‚Äòsocial bequests‚Äô, which focus the attention away from neoclassical theory altogether. Strong sustainability assumes that the economic and environmental capital is complementary, but not interchangeable. Strong sustainability accepts there are certain functions that the environment performs that cannot be duplicated by humans or human made capital. The ozone layer is one example of an ecosystem service that is crucial for human existence, forms part of natural capital, but is difficult for humans to duplicate. Unlike weak sustainability, strong sustainability puts the emphasis on ecological scale over economic gains. This implies that nature has a right to exist and that it has been borrowed and should be passed on from one generation to the next still intact in its original form. An example of strong sustainability could be the manufacturing of office carpet tiles from used car tyres. In this scenario, office carpets and other products are manufactured from used motorcar tires that would have been sent to a landfill. Origins and theory =Capital approach to sustainability and intergenerational equity= To understand the concept of weak sustainability, it is first necessary to explore the capital approach to sustainability. This is key to the idea of intergenerational equity. This implies that a fair distribution of resources and assets between generations exists. Decision makers, both in theory and practice, need a concept that enables assessment in order to decide if intergenerational equity is achieved. The capital approach lends itself to this task. In this context we must distinguish between the different types of capital. Human capital (e.g. skills, knowledge) and natural capital (e.g. minerals, water) tend to be the most frequently cited examples. Within the concept it is believed that the amount of capital a generation has at its disposal is decisive for its development. A development is then called sustainable when it leaves the capital stock at least unchanged. =Sustainable development= The weak sustainability paradigm stems from the 1970s. It began as an extension of the neoclassical theory of economic growth, accounting for non-renewable natural resources as a factor of production. However, it only really came into the mainstream in the 1990s within the context of sustainable development discourse. At its inception, sustainability was interpreted as a requirement to preserve, intact, the environment as we find it today in all its forms. The Brundtland Report, for example, stated that ‚ÄòThe loss of plant and animal species can greatly limit the options of future generations. The result is that sustainable development requires the conservation of plant and animal species‚Äô. =Development of theory= Wilfred Beckerman posits that the absolutist concept of sustainable development given above is morally repugnant. The largest part of the world's population live in acute poverty. Taking that as well as the acute degradation into account, one could justify using up vast resources in an attempt to preserve certain species from extinction. These species providing no real benefit for society other than a possible value for the knowledge of their continued existence. He argues that such a task would involve using resources that could have instead been devoted to more pressing world concerns. Examples include increasing access to clean drinking water or sanitation in the Third World. Many environmentalists shifted their attention to the idea of ‚Äòweak‚Äô sustainability. This allows for some natural resources to decrease as long as sufficient compensation is provided by increases in other resources. The result usually was an increase in human capital. This compensation is in the form of sustained human welfare. This is illustrated in a well-regarded definition by David Pearce, the author of numerous works on sustainability. He defines sustainability as implying something about maintaining the level of human welfare (or well-being) so that it may improve, but never declines (or, not more than temporarily). This implies sustainable development will not decrease over time. Inter-generational equity assumes each following generation has at least as much capital at its disposal as the preceding generation. The idea of leaving capital stock at least unchanged is widely accepted. The question arises, whether or not one form of capital may be substituted by another. This is the focus of the debate between ‚Äòweak‚Äô and ‚Äòstrong‚Äô sustainability, and how intergenerational equity is to be achieved. It is also important to note that strong sustainability does not share the notion of inter-changeability. Since the nineties, there has been an ardent debate on the substitutability between natural and human-made capital. While \\"Weak Sustainability\\" supporters mainly believe that these are substitutable, \\"Strong Sustainability\\" followers generally contest the possibility of inter- changeability. Role of governance and policy recommendations The implementation of weak sustainability in governance can be viewed theoretically and practically through Hartwick's rule. In resource economics, Hartwick's rule defines the amount of investment in human capital that is needed to offset declining stocks of non-renewable resources. Solow showed that, given a degree of substitutability between human capital and natural capital, one way to design a sustainable consumption program for an economy is to accumulate man-made capital. When this accumulation is sufficiently rapid the effect from the shrinking exhaustible resource stock is countered by the services from the increased human capital stock. Hartwick's rule, is often referred to as \\"invest resource rents\\", where ‚Äòrent‚Äô is payment to a factor of production (in this case capital) in excess of that needed to keep it in its present use. This requires that a nation invest all rent earned from exhaustible resources currently extracted. Later, Pearce and Atkinson and Hamilton added to Hartwick's rule, by setting out a theoretical and empirical measure of net investment in human and natural capital (and later human capital) that became known as genuine savings. Genuine savings measures net changes in produced, natural and human capital stocks, valued in monetary terms. The aim of governance therefore should be to keep genuine savings above or equal to zero. In this sense it is similar to green accounting, which attempts to factor environmental costs into the financial results of operations. A key example of this is the World Bank, who now regularly publishes a comparative and comprehensive set of genuine savings estimates for over 150 countries which is called ‚Äòadjusted savings‚Äô. Weak sustainability in practice A prime example of a weak sustainability is the Government Pension Fund of Norway. Statoil ASA, a state-owned Norwegian oil company invested its surplus profits from petroleum into a pension portfolio to date worth over $1 trillion. The oil, a type of natural capital, was exported in vast quantities by Norway. The resultant fund allows for long-lasting income for the population in exchange for a finite resource, actually increasing the total capital available for Norway above the original levels. This example shows how weak sustainability and substitution can be cleverly applied on a national scale, although it is recognised that its applications are very restricted on a global scale. In this application, Hartwick's rule would state that the pension fund was sufficient capital to offset the depletion of the oil resources. A less positive case is that of the small Pacific nation of Nauru. A substantial phosphate deposit was found on the island in 1900, and now approximately 80% of the island has been rendered uninhabitable after over 100 years of mining. Concurrent with this extraction, Nauru's inhabitants, over the last few decades of the twentieth century, have enjoyed a high per capita income. Money from the mining of phosphate enabled the establishment of a trust fund, which was estimated to be as much as $1 billion. However, chiefly as a result of the Asian financial crisis, the trust fund was almost entirely wiped out. This ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô of Nauru followed the logic of weak sustainability, and almost led to complete environmental destruction. This case presents a telling argument against weak sustainability, suggesting that a substitution of natural for man-made capital may not be reversible in the long-term.  Criticisms of the strong vs. weak sustainability model  Martinez-Allier's address concerns over the implications of measuring weak sustainability, after results of work conducted by Pearce & Atkinson in the early 1990s. By their measure, most of the Northern, industrialised countries are deemed sustainable, as is the world economy as a whole. This point of view can be considered to be flawed since the world would (arguably) not be sustainable if all countries have the resource intensity rate and pollution rate of many industrialised countries. Industrialization does not necessarily equate to sustainability. According to Pearce and Atkinson's calculations, the Japanese economy is one of the most sustainable economies in the world. The reason for this is that its saving rate is so high. This trend still remains today and therefore exceeds depreciation on both natural and man-made capital. Thus, they suggest that it is the gross negligence of factors other than savings in measuring sustainability that makes weak sustainability an inappropriate concept. The integrative sustainability model has the economy completely located within society and society completely located within the environment. In other words, the economy is a subset of society and society is completely dependent upon the environment. This interdependence means that any sustainability-related issue must be considered holistically. diagram indicating the relationship between the three pillars of sustainability, suggesting that both economy and society are constrained by environmental limitsScott Cato, M. (2009). Green Economics. London: Earthscan, pp. 36‚Äì37. . Other inadequacies of the paradigm include the difficulties in measuring savings rates and the inherent problems in quantifying the many different attributes and functions of the biophysical world in monetary terms. By including all human and biophysical resources under the same heading of ‚Äòcapital‚Äô, the depleting of fossil fuels, reduction of biodiversity and so forth, are potentially compatible with sustainability. As Gowdy & O'Hara so aptly put it, \\"As long as the criterion of weak sustainability is met, with savings outstripping capital depletion, there is no conflict between the destruction of species and ecosystems or the depletion of fossil fuels, and the goal of sustainability.\\" Opposing weak sustainability, strong sustainability supporters contend that we need \\"a more small-scale decentralized way of life based upon greater self-reliance, so as to create a social and economic system less destructive towards nature.\\" Strong sustainability does not make allowances for the substitution of human, and human made capital for Earth's land, water, and their biodiversity. The products created by mankind cannot replace the natural capital found in ecosystems. Another critical weakness of the concept is related to environmental resilience. According to Van Den Bergh, resilience can be considered as a global, structural stability concept, based on the idea that multiple, locally stable ecosystems can exist. Sustainability can thus be directly related to resilience. With this in mind, weak sustainability can cause extreme sensitivity to either natural disturbances (such as diseases in agriculture with little crop diversity) or economic disturbances (as outlined in the case study of Nauru above). This high level of sensitivity within regional systems in the face of external factors brings to attention an important inadequacy of weak sustainability.  Rejection of both weak and strong models  Some critics have gone one step further, dismissing the entire concept of sustainability. Beckerman's influential work concludes that weak sustainability is, ‚Äúredundant and illogical‚Äù. He holds that sustainability only makes sense in its 'strong' form, but that \\"requires subscribing to a morally repugnant and totally impracticable objective.\\" He goes as far to say that he regrets so much time has been wasted on the entire concept of sustainable development. Contradictorily, it could be argued that even weak sustainability measures are better than having no measures or action at all. Others have suggested a better approach to sustainability would be that of \\"social bequests\\". This change would \\"free us from a 'zero-sum' game in which our gain is an automatic loss for future generations\\". The social bequest approach looks at the problem in a different light by changing to what, rather than how much, we leave to future generations. When the problem is phrased as ‚Äòhow much‚Äô this always implies that some amount of a resource should be used and some left. Daniel Bromley uses the example of rainforests to illustrate his argument. If we decide to use 25% of a rainforest and leave the rest, but then the next time we make a decision we start all over again and use 25% of what's left, and so on, eventually there will be no rainforest left. By focusing on bequests of specific rights and opportunities for future generations, we can remove ourselves from the \\"straightjacket of substitution and marginal tradeoffs of neoclassical theory\\".

In 1993, Murphy decided to sell Interbrand, which by then had a headcount of 600 and a burgeoning international practice, to Omnicom. He stayed on at Omnicom as Interbrand's chairperson till 1996 to help with the transition. Suffolk beer and Plymouth gin As he relinquished hands-on management of Interbrand, Murphy turned his hand to building brands himself. Pondering why it was so difficult to buy English beers and ales abroad, he realised it was because many brewers' primary marketing thrust was through the pubs they controlled in their local territories, rather than through their brands. People in England tend to drink the local ales and beers served in their local pub. In 1996, Murphy established St. Peter's, a small artisan brewery in Bungay, Suffolk, from scratch, with an international brand to suit ‚Äì and without a substantial chain of controlled pub outlets.

At tall, it is Australia's tallest lighthouse. The lighthouse is listed on the Commonwealth Heritage Register. There are eleven timber flights of stairs in the lighthouse, with twenty steps each, which must be climbed in order to reach the top. Surrounding the lighthouse are the remains of a number of associated buildings, including a small church. There are also a number of gravestones, many belonging to those who were shipwrecked in the area after the lighthouse was built. History The lighthouse was originally established in 1861, in response to the sinking of the barque Cataraqui sixteen years earlier, a disaster which had resulted in the deaths of 400 people. While it was being constructed, some worried that the lighthouse would cause more shipwrecks than it prevented, as lighthouses usually showed the way to safety rather than warning of danger as the Cape Wickham lighthouse was designed to do. Nonetheless, the lighthouse was eventually completed, although shipwrecks frequently continued to occur until the Currie Lighthouse was completed in 1879. Built from locally quarried stone, the lighthouse was manned by a superintendent until the light was automated in the 1920s. The superintendent often came into conflict with hunters and other established inhabitants of the island, with one 1873 report stating: The lighthouse circa 1887. The superintendent's quarters can be seen to the left. The superintendents were required to be extremely self- sufficient, as only one supply ship visited the site a year. Some of the lightkeepers resorted to looting and theft to supplement these supplies, with one keeper being dismissed for storing goods that his brother had looted from a shipwreck. In the 1920s, it was determined that it was no longer necessary for the light to be manned on a full-time basis, and automation systems were added to the lighthouse. At this time, a number of the surrounding buildings were also demolished, including the superintendent's residence. The lighthouse continued to be looked after by the lighthouse keeper from nearby Currie. During preparations for the 150th anniversary of the lighthouse, it was discovered that it had never been officially opened. To rectify this oversight, Australian Governor-General Quentin Bryce officially opened the lighthouse in a ceremony on 5 November 2011.

As Kim grew up listening to old stories told by both her grandmothers, who would cook rice in a big iron pot placed over firewood, her childhood was greatly influenced by her grandmothers. When she lived with her great-grandmother, playing in a village that had many streams, she yearned to become a teacher and a policewoman. She was fascinated by her teacher who knew everything and did anything for her. Filled with the desire to ride in a police car, she once lied that she was lost. Kim and her friends walked into the local police station where a policeman gave them some bread, patiently listened to their stories, and drove them back home in his police car.\\"ÍπÄÎ†§Î†π\\" LTI Korea Datasheet: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# When Kim was in high school, she watched a Hong Kong movie called Yes, Madam, and immediately afterwards with her friends she signed up to learn kung fu. The craze lasted about a year, but her then- experience at a martial arts gym was useful in writing her bestseller young- adult novel Wandeuk, which includes a kickboxing gym as part of the background. In that story, she demonstrated such a realistic portrayal of the behavior and psychological state of a teenage boy that some readers said they felt as though a seventeen-year-old boy was living within the writer's heart. It also helped greatly that she maintained her friendship with her former kung fu class buddies who later became kickboxing coaches. Only after turning thirty, could Kim, who had gotten married and had two children by then, enter the creative writing department of Seoul Institute of the Arts. Kim had a habit of taking notes when she heard an unusual mode of speech or met someone behaving in a striking manner, and this became a strong tool for the late starter. Compared to most other children's stories, Kim's works tend to introduce a great number of characters, all who have distinctive, and unique characteristics, earning her the critique \\"a writer with impressive characters.\\" Work Kim's work generally focuses on adolescent issues. Kim's characters are extremely typical, ordinary neighbors one might run into in any alley, but on taking a closer look they reveal hard-earned scars.

It is the type species of the genus Pandalus and is variously known as the pink shrimp, Aesop shrimp and Aesop prawn.Pandalus montagui (Leach, 1814) FAO: Fisheries and Aquaculture Department. Retrieved 2011-11-04. Description Pandalus montagui is a translucent, pinkish shrimp, generally growing to about long. Its colour is due to a number of red chromatophores and the few short red streaks running obliquely on the carapace. The rostrum is long, up-curved and divided at the tip with 10‚Äì12 teeth on its posterior dorsal edge. A spine is found under the eye on the carapace. The first antenna divides into two parts and the second is very long, exceeding the length of the body and being banded in pale and dark brown.Pink shrimp ‚Äì Pandalus montagui Marine Life Information Network. Retrieved 2011-11-04.Pandalus montagui Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-11-04. This shrimp can be distinguished from the rather similar P. tridens by having a shorter rostrum and longer dactyls (claws) on the third and fourth pereopods (walking limbs). Distribution and habitat Pandalus montagui has a boreo-arctic distribution. Its range extends from Greenland and Iceland, the Arctic Ocean, and the northern Atlantic Ocean, south to Rhode Island and the British Isles. It prefers hard substrates, but can be found on rock, gravel, sand, and mud. It is most common at depths between , but sometimes occurs near low-water mark or at depths to . Biology P. montagui is an omnivore, predator, and scavenger. Its diet consists mainly of small crustaceans such as copepods, hydroids, and polychaete worms. Off the Labrador coast, a large daily vertical migration was found, with the shrimp being benthic in the daytime and pelagic at night. Most individuals start life as males, but change sex to females at 12‚Äì15 months old. In the North Sea, off Britain, each female lays 2000‚Äì3000 eggs in November. When fertilised, she carries them around for a few days on her periopods. They then hatch and go through six zoeal and two to five decapod planktonic larval stages before undergoing metamorphosis and settling as juveniles. The rate of development of the larvae depends on the water temperature. In the more temperate parts of the range, the shrimp mature within a year. Ecology In the North Sea, P. montagui is often found living in association with the polychaete worm Sabellaria spinulosa. The worm sometimes forms cold-water reefs, and these are an important source of food for the shrimp. Fisherman have used this fact by identifying the locations of reefs and then trawling for shrimp nearby. The Aesop shrimp is sometimes found to be parasitized by the bopyrid isopod, Hemiarthrus abdominalis. This isopod also parasitizes several other species of shrimp, but has never been found on Pandalus borealis. Fishery This species is fished commercially in the United Kingdom, but mostly taken as an alternative to the larger P. borealis. About 500 tons a year of P. montagui were caught globally in the period 2005‚Äì2007, catches also being recorded from Belgium, Denmark, the Far√∂e Islands, the Netherlands, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden.

Appointed by President Andrew Jackson, he served as the United States' first envoy to the Far East, and went on USS Peacock on non-resident diplomatic missions to the courts of Cochinchina, Thailand (\\"Siam\\") and Muscat and Oman during the years 1832-6\\\\. Roberts concluded treaties with Thailand and Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, ratified in Washington, D.C. 30 June 1834. He returned in 1836 to exchange ratifications with Oman and Thailand and to the court of Minh M·∫°ng in Cochinchina for a second attempt at negotiation. He fell seriously ill with dysentery and died in Portuguese Macau, which precluded his becoming America's first envoy to Edo Japan.  Early life  Roberts was born 29 June 1784 to Sarah Griffiths of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Royal Navy Captain Edmund Roberts, who died 15 November 1787 and was interred in North Cemetery leaving his son a half-orphan in his mother's care. Young Edmund at age 13 received through his congressman a Midshipman's warrant in the United States Navy, but waived the appointment at his mother's wish for him to remain at home while she lived. Roberts put to sea in 1800, eventually residing in London until age 24. Returning in 1808, he married Miss Catherine Whipple Langdon -- daughter of Judge Woodbury Langdon and niece of Governor John Langdon , both of whom were engaged in the New England triangular trade between Portsmouth, the Caribbean and London; and among Portsmouth's wealthiest and most politically connected citizens. Of the couple's 11 children, 8 survived their parents. New Hampshire (with only of coastline) and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine are credited with shaping Roberts' character. = Roberts the merchant = Roberts entered the New England triangular trade as shipowner and his own supercargo, but never as a captain. Robert Hopkins Miller says Roberts lost his accumulated wealth in a series of misfortunes, but succeeded in 1823 in being appointed US Consul at Demerara. However, Miller erroneously places Demerara on the east coast of Africa, and does not mention the Demerara rebellion of 1823. \\"The 1823 revolt had a special significance...[in that i]t attracted attention in Britain inside and outside Parliament to the terrible evil slavery and the need to abolish it.\\" Roberts' own account mentions neither Demerara nor the slave revolt but his palpable aversion to slavery colors his negotiating stance, where subjects act as slaves to the king). By 1827, nearly impoverished by depredations of French and Spanish privateers on his ships in the West Indies, he chartered Mary Ann to trade in the Indian Ocean. Roberts arrived in the port of Zanzibar in October 1827, and the next year, had an audience with the newly arrived Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, who was so anxious to counterbalance British influence that he asked Roberts to escort some vessels to the United States to petition for trade; Roberts promised to bring the matter up with his Government. Upon returning, he wrote U.S. Senator Levi Woodbury, a personal friend, of the aggravations endured by American shipping, that might be alleviated by negotiating commercial treaties. = To the farthest port of the rich Indies = Latin: Divitis Indiae usque ad ultimum sinumThe stage was set for Roberts diplomatic career by Salem's trade with China and the East Indies. Pursuits of members of the East India Marine Society, established in 1799 and composed of those who had sailed beyond the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn as masters or supercargoes contributed to the beginnings of US international relations during the period of 1788 to 1845. From 1826 to 1832, John Shillaber, American consul in Batavia, sent a series of letters suggesting that he be empowered to negotiate trade treaties. Martin van Buren replied in a letter dated 13 December 1830, sent over the signature of clerk Daniel Brent, requesting a more precise knowledge of the nature and character of the governments in question, and more details on difficulties encountered. Matters came to a head after Charles Moses Endicott, master of the merchantman Friendship of Salem, engaged in the spice trade on the Sumatran coast, returned to report the brig Governor Endicott, also of Salem, and James Monroe of New York, had recaptured his ship from pirates who had plundered her, murdering several crewmen. In the wake of public outcry, President Jackson ordered Commodore John Downes of the frigate , which had been preparing to sail for the west coast, to proceed instead on the first Sumatran expedition, departing New York harbor on 19 August 1831. Subsequent events Peacock. Alfred T. Agate. Pencil.Fortune favored Roberts. His friend Woodbury, who as senator had been pressing for increased naval appropriations when he received Robert's letter on the need for trade negotiations, had just become Jackson's Secretary of the Navy and saw an opportunity. As Potomac was departing the schooner was nearing commissioning; , outfitted for exploration but due to lack of funds diverted to duty in the West Indies, had returned for re-fit. Woodbury convinced Jackson to send both 10-gun ships to support Potomac - with Roberts as Jackson's \\"special agent\\". Secretary of State Edward Livingston's \\"Instructions to Special Agent Edmund Roberts\\" signed 27 January 1832, ordering him to embark upon Peacock in the guise of the captain's clerk, his mission's purpose concealed except from the captain and those with a need to know; while in passage he was to gather as much as possible of the knowledge previously requested of Shillaber; his duties as envoy would then begin at Cochin-China. Livingston added a postscript that Roberts is to receive $6 per diem. Jackson later explained to the Senate in his message of 30 May 1834, \\"The expenses of the agency have been defrayed out of the contingent fund for foreign intercourse\\". In mid-February 1832, Boxer was dispatched to Liberia. with orders to join Peacock off the coast of Brazil, but the ships failed to rendezvous until 5 June 1834 - in the unhealthy roadstead of Batavia. In March 1832, Peacock sailed for Brazil under Commander David Geisinger, with Francis Baylies appointed charg√© d‚Äôaffaires to Buenos Aires and secret agent Roberts. His published account follows the general outline of that published two years previously of East India Company agent John Crawfurd's 1822 mission to Siam and Cochinchina. Roberts, in both his report to State and in his journal, cites page 269 of his copy of Mr. Crawford - page 414 in Crawfurd's second edition. Alt URL Boxer having failed to show by the time appointed, orders were left at Montevideo for her to join up at Bencoolen. Peacock sailed by way of the Cape Horn and made Bencoolen on 23 August 1833; the Dutch Resident reported Potomac had completed her mission, thus freeing Peacock to continue Roberts' quest for intelligence.  Roberts' first mission  Pursuant to orders to gather information before going to Cochinchina, Peacock sailed for Manila by way of Long Island and Crokatoa, where hot springs found on the eastern side of the islands from the shore boiled furiously up, through many fathoms of water. Peacocks marine chronometers proving useless, she threaded the Sunda Strait by dead reckoning. Diarrhea and dysentery were prevalent among the crew from Angier to Manila. After a fortnight there, cholera struck, despite the overall cleanliness of the ship. Peacock lost seven men; many who recovered died of other diseases. No new case of cholera occurred after she got under way 2 November 1833 for Macau. Within of Lamma Island or Wanshan Archipelago, she took aboard a maritime pilot after settling on a fee of thirteen dollars and a bottle of rum. = Macao and Canton City = CongressAmericans arriving at the port of Canton City were treated much the same as other foreigners willing to conduct trade through the co-hong, Chinese mercantile houses granted imperial monopolies in foreign commerce. The trade was lucrative, but foreign traders were social and political inferiors, with no guarantees for their lives, property, or rights of trade or residence. While this rankled the English, Americans and others were unwilling to meddle, lest that bring about what they feared most -- a trade embargo. under Captain John D. Henley, the first US naval vessel to call on China, arrived on 3 November 1819 at Lintin Island. Chinese officials alarmed at the arrival of a warship, commanded her captain not to enter the Pearl River. Advised by the U.S. consul that no adverse action would be taken, Captain Henley boldly entered to re-provision his ship. In January 1830, the sloop-of-war under Commander William B. Finch, then on America's first global circumnavigation, remained over a fortnight at Canton, where American merchants advised him that an annual naval visit would be valuable - if their commanders would show \\"the same deference toward the customs of China, and conciliatory disposition as exhibited by yourself\\", which Finch duly reports to the Navy department. There is no indication that Finch's report was forwarded to State, or that Roberts had seen it, even though conditions were practically the same in all nearby \\"Sinicized\\" tributary kingdoms, i.e., conduct oneself circumspectly, with no guarantees one way or the other. In the latter months of 1832, Roberts visited Macao and Canton City, where he notes, \\"The Chinese merchants have a well- earned reputation as shrewd dealers : they have little confidence in each other; every contract of importance must be 'fixed,' and made sure by the payment of a stipulated sum : but they place the most unlimited confidence in the integrity of their foreign customers\\"(p. 128.) Roberts devoted most of Chapters VI to XVII to history, customs and governance of the \\"Celestial Kingdom\\", and leaves it to the reader to conclude why \\"Celestials\\" have little confidence in one another. He engages John Robert Morrison as Chinese translator and personal secretary, who was to return by way of Singapore. = Cochin-China = :See Minh M·∫°ng's isolationist foreign policy Six weeks after arriving at Linting, and after enduring several days of rainy and squally weather, Peacock sailed for the bay of Turan (Da Nang) as the best point to communicate with Hu·∫ø, about fifty miles distant, it being impossible to anchor off the bar of Hue due to the East Asian Monsoon. Arriving off the bay on 1 January 1833, contrary winds from the northwest rather than the expected northeast quarter, coupled with a strong southward current caused the ship to lose ground on every tack, until on January 6, she sailed into an unknown bay which proved to host Ph√∫ Y√™n Province's Vung-lam harbour. A raggedly-dressed and dirty old man came on board there who appeared to be somewhat superior to the fishermen who brought him. Rather disconcerted at not being offered a seat, he expressed a desire to leave. Once it was learned that he was the principal person in the village, he was invited down to a seat on the gun- deck, where he was closely questioned as to just where the ship was and the extent of government and defenses. Being informed the ship bore an envoy anxious to reach the capital, the old man cheerfully said the ship might return northward to it in three or four days. This remark was forgotten at the time, and ruefully recalled after the mission failed to receive an official invitation to Hue. Roberts attributes subsequent misunderstandings to their national vanity and prejudices, and gives a detailed record of his own. Miller says a modern Vietnamese suggests Roberts seemed to lack \\"diplomatic flexibility,\\" and his descriptions of the people are ‚Äúdenuded of all goodwill and understanding.‚Äù Roberts died before publication of his account, without having had a chance to revise it. As published, he reports playing a joke on court deputies when pressed for his titles, which in the usage of the day, were usually quite long.) The opening line subsequently appears above his signature to the treaty he successfully negotiates with Thailand. = Siam = : See Siamese‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Amity and Commerce; Thailand‚ÄìUnited States relations = Muscat = Roberts' interest in becoming a diplomat was sparked by an earlier visit around 1827 to Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman. A treaty with the Sultan was signed at Muscat on September 21, 1833.  Second mission  Naval surgeon William Ruschenberger (1807-1895) commissioned on Peacock, commanded by lieutenant Cornelius Stribling, accompanied by Schooner Enterprise, lieutenants commanding A. S. Campbell; both under the command of Commodore Edmund P. Kennedy.  Aftermath and legacy  A bill for the settlement of the accounts of Edmund Roberts, late diplomatic agent of the United States to Cochin China, Muscat, and Siam, proposed that his legal representatives be authorized to draw the salary of a charg√© d'affaires, without the outfit, less the per diem already paid, from the time of his appointment January 27, 1832, until six months after his death June 13, 1836. Roberts' account of his mission was published posthumously; his papers were placed on deposit by the Portsmouth Historical Society in July 1991. His mission was commemorated in a historical perspective on gifts to the United States of America at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. Roberts is also known for having requested issues of 1804-dated American Turban Head eagles and the Draped Bust dollars (the famous 1804 dollar) as parts of presentation proof coinage to be carried on his second mission. Neither Roberts' nor Ruschenberger's accounts are those of a polished diplomat, but were written \\"for a general American audience to acquaint them with the realities of a far-off land and culture\\" - subsequently collected and republished as Two Yankee Diplomats In 1830s Siam.

A sequel to the 2010 film Singam and the second installment in the Singam film series, the film stars Suriya, Hansika Motwani and Anushka Shetty. This film is the second installment in the Singam film series. Produced by S. Lakshman Kumar, its music and score was composed by Devi Sri Prasad. The film was released on 5 July 2013 along with a Telugu dubbed version simply titled Singam, also known as Yamudu II. A Hindi dubbed version entitled Main Hoon Surya: Singham II was released later on 2 August. Plot After having killed extortionist Mayil Vaaganam, police officer Durai Singam covertly meets Home Minister Ramanathan on the highways, while returning to Chennai. 2 days before, Durai Singam publicly resigns from police and returns to his hometown. Eight months later, he starts working as an NCC master in a Thoothukudi school, and studies the illegal activities happening, for undercover purpose. The only people who know about this operation are the Chief Minister Kumaravel and Ramanathan. Sathya is a +2 student who has heavy infatuation on Singam, though he is waiting to marry his love interest Kavya. Singam's father Soundara Pandi is angry about him leaving the police force. He also forbids the marriage between Singam and Kavya, as he fears that Kavya's billionaire father Mahalingam might take Singam away to manage his business empire and that Singam will lose respect with his relatives. Susai, a local who works as peon at the singam's school, shows Singam parts of Thoothukudi and tells him about the rogue happenings in those places. Singam requests Ramanathan to transfer his colleagues Erimalai and Damodarai to assist him. Singam later learns that Sathya is the niece of a businessman named Thangaraj. Thangaraj is partners with Bhai, a criminal who controls the southeast coastline of Tamil Nadu. Bhai and Thangaraj have connections with the international gangster and drug lord Michael Kong, aka Danny, and they are trafficking cocaine. Singam does not know about their connection and keeps Bhai in his off-duty surveillance. One day, due to a verbal fight in a pub, Bhai's chief drug importer Saghayam kidnaps a girl from another caste after her brother (another don) insults his, and holds her ransom until sunset. This causes riots between both gangs in the city, and Singam's school principal has to close the school for the day. With his info connections, Singam learns of the problem, takes charge as new DSP, rescues the girl, and returns her to her family. He is praised by the public and is also forgiven by his father. Meanwhile, Sathya learns that Kavya and Singam are strongly in love and distances herself from them. Singam then finds out about Thangaraj and Bhai's partnership. He decides to arrest Saghayam first at the harbour, who has brought Danny with him to attend Thangaraj's new hotel party. Sagayam is arrested, along with Danny for insulting the police. Thangaraj tries to make Singam release the duo, but to no avail. Bhai sends an army of rowdies to bust Danny and Saghayam out of prison. Singam then finds that Danny has escaped, the police station is in ruins, and his fellow officers are injured. All of Singam's efforts are spoiled, and the next morning, he is suspended for unruly behavior. Singam warns Bhai that he knows about Danny and will return soon. Singam meets Ramanathan at Chennai, and proposes plans for an operation to arrest all of Danny's associates in India. He then gets re-appointed and gets his superior suspended. He gets authorization to kill drug dealers on sight even without evidence. Since the next load of drugs is ready to be delivered by Danny, Bhai decides that Saghayam will deliver the drugs to him in Kerala, and he will bring it back, but he is arrested by Singam. Later, at Singam's engagement function, Mayil Vaaganam's former ally Harbour Shanmugam informs him that Thangaraj has hired goons to attack his home and family that night. Singam fights the goons himself and kills them all. He then places a drug bag insides Thangaraj's house and jails him. The next day however, Singam is informed that Sathya has committed suicide by consuming poison, despite previously being told by Singam about her uncle's criminal activity. He analyzes that Sathya was killed by her father as plotted by Thangaraj, whom Singam confronts in prison and ensures that if he cannot prove it by arresting Danny, he will give Thangaraj a death penalty, or else Singam will kill Thangaraj and go to prison instead. Singam seeks permission from Ramanathan for traveling to South Africa as his marriage will take place in three days. Singam arrives in South Africa and joins Major Carl Ambrose and the police to confront Danny, who has taken sanctuary with Durban based don Alex. Singam and the Durban police give chase by car, which kills Alex in the process. Singam defeats Danny and Alex's men and confronts Danny on his ship. The two fight furiously and ends with Singam's victory over Danny, arresting him, and dragging him to the same cell from which he escaped. Afterwards, he reunites with Kavya. Cast * Suriya as S.

The language was brought into the Indian subcontinent by various Turkic and Afghan dynasties, in particular the Turko- Afghan Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Dynasty. Persian held official status in the court and the administration within these empires and it heavily influenced many of the local languages, particularly modern standard Hindi and modern standard Urdu. Evidence of Persian's historical influence there can be seen in the extent of its influence on the languages of the Indian subcontinent. Many of these areas have seen a certain influence by Persian not only in literature but also in everyday speech. Persian exerted a strong influence on Balochi (an Iranic language), Pashto (another Iranic language), and Urdu, but also a relatively strong influence on Indic languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi and Bengali. Other languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati and Rajasthani also have a considerable amount of loan words from Persian. Persian's official status was replaced with English in 1835 by British East India Company. After 1843, Hindustani and English gradually replaced Persian in importance in the Indian subcontinent as the British had full suzerainty over the Indian subcontinent. Persian inscriptions The basis for the introduction of Persian language into the Indian subcontinent was set, from its earliest days, by various Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties.Sigfried J. de Laet. History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century UNESCO, 1994. p 734 Thus, when the early Turks, Afghans, and Turko-Persians imported the language to the Indian subcontinent, they laid the basis for its patronisation in the centuries to come, notably by the Delhi Sultanate (who were once again of Turko-Afghan origin) and the Mughals (who were of Turko-Mongol origin). There are many stone carvings and plasters of Persian inscriptions in India. There are also many handwritten books mostly from the time of Humayun, a Mughal emperor who had heavy admiration for anything West Asian, and Persian in particular. Humayun lost Mughal territories to the Pashtun noble, Sher Shah Suri, but, with the aid of the powerful West Asian Safavids, regained them 15 years later. Humayun's return from Persia, accompanied by a large retinue of Persian noblemen, signaled an important change in Mughal court culture, as the Central Asian origins of the dynasty were largely overshadowed by the influences of Persian art, architecture, language, and literature. There are many carved stones and Persian manuscripts in the Indian subcontinent from the time of Humayun. Subsequently, in a very short time, Humayun was able to expand the Empire further, leaving a substantial legacy for his son, Akbar. His peaceful personality, patience, and non-provocative methods of speech earned him the title Insan-i Kamil (), meaning literally perfect man, among the Mughals.

Today, the association counts among its members over 140 European and international schools of architecture, representing some 5000 teaching staff and over 120,000 students.EAAE/AEEA website EAAE/AEEA Charter for Architectural Research The Charter for Architectural Research is intended as a reference document for the use of universities, architecture schools, research institutions, funding agencies, and professional practices that are undertaking architectural research. It specifies the character and objectives of architectural research, confirms the variety of valid methodologies and supports the development of a vibrant, internationally recognized and well funded research community. The Charter, produced by the EAAE/AEEA Research Committee between 2009 and 2011, consists of two distinct parts : A short \\"Declaration\\" approved at the General Assembly in September 2011, and a more detailed \\"Framework\\" document, on which work is ongoing, and concerning which comments are of course invited from the community of educators and researchers in architecture. =Declaration on Architectural Research= Architecture is about the creation, transformation and interpretation of the built environment and the articulation of space at various scales. It is a discipline involving art, design, conservation, planning, management, construction and representation, addressing issues of ethics, aesthetics, culture and society. The discipline of architecture engages with the cultural, socio-economic and environmental conditions affecting our quality of life. Architecture is facing challenges of climate change, globalisation, urbanisation and social transformation that necessitate vital research. In parallel, the horizons of architectural experimentation are expanding rapidly with the development of new technologies and media. If we are to understand, explain, anticipate and influence the consequences of these changes, research is essential. Moreover, research is essential for the continued expansion of the discipline‚Äôs knowledge base and improvement in teaching, learning and practice of architecture. The EAAE/AEEA confirms that architectural research has a particular knowledge base, tools and methods; it confirms the trans-disciplinary nature of architectural research and the legitimacy of a wide range of approaches. Architecture tackles various dimensions of the built environment in a specifically integrative way; the EAAE/AEEA calls for recognition of all appropriate areas and modes of architectural research, for better definition of context and scope and acknowledges research by design as part of the diversity of valid methods with which to research, practice and study architecture. The generic expectations of originality, rigour and significance apply to all genres of architectural research. Valid architectural research outputs are as varied as the constantly growing range of research approaches and the EAAE/AEEA recognises installations, experimental projects, proposals, models and actual buildings as such, in addition to written and graphic research outputs. Peer review, communication and international dissemination are crucial and should relate to the nature of the research. The EAAE/AEEA advocates stronger links between theoretical and practice-based research and therefore between academia and the profession in the establishment of an expanded arena of architectural research.

University is offering the study disciplines of painting, illustration and graphics, fashion design, product design, graphic design, ceramics and porcelain, photography and architecture. Establishment The Academy was founded in 1885 as the School of Applied Arts in Prague (UP≈†). At the time of its establishment it was the first and only state art school in Bohemia. Its mission, according to the founding charter, was ‚Äúto nurture manpower skillful in the arts for the artistic industry and to train educational staff for applied arts teaching and for teaching drawing at secondary schools.‚Äù It was divided into a three-year general education school and follow-up three- to five-year vocational and special schools with the disciplines of architecture, sculpture, drawing, painting, film & TV graphics, metal working, wood carving, floral painting and textiles. The faculty staff was chosen from among the leading personalities of Czech culture. The first director of the school was the architect Franti≈°ek Schmoranz Jr. and the teaching staff included Franti≈°ek ≈Ωen√≠≈°ek (1885‚Äì1896), Josef V√°clav Myslbek (1885‚Äì1896), Jakub Schikaneder (1885‚Äì1923), Celda Klouƒçek (1887‚Äì1917), Felix Jenewein (1890‚Äì1902), Otakar Hostinsky (1847‚Äì1910), and Friedrich Ohmann (1888‚Äì1898). Among the first graduates were Jan Preisler, Stanislav Sucharda, Josef Ma≈ôatka, Vojtƒõch Preissig, Franti≈°ek Kobliha, Bohumil Kafka, Milo≈° Slov√°k and Julius Ma≈ô√°k. In 1896, the position of the Academy of Fine Arts (AVU) was reinforced by its nationalization. Some of the teaching staff left UP≈† and the school focused primarily on applied arts. The architect Ji≈ô√≠ Stibral (1886‚Äì1920) became the new director. The faculty staff comprised Stanislav Sucharda, Jan Preisler, Karel V√≠tƒõzslav Ma≈°ek, Alois Dry√°k, Ladislav ≈†aloun and Jan Kotƒõra. They were later joined by Karel Boromejsk√Ω M√°dl, who worked as art professor and library administrator. Kotƒõra advocated \\"unity of visual culture and the creation of a modern style.\\" Art Nouveau period At the turn of the century, UP≈† became one of the centres of the Art Nouveau movement, inspired by its achievements in the late 19th century. And so the school represented Czech art at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1900, where it won the prestigious Grand Prix. The new generation of students in the early 20th century included future representatives of Czech Cubism and the interwar avant-garde - Josef ƒåapek, V√°clav Bene≈°, Josef Goƒç√°r, Franti≈°ek Kysela, Bohumil Kubi≈°ta, Otakar Novotn√Ω, Linka Proch√°zkov√°, Jan Zrzav√Ω, V√°clav ≈†p√°la, Josef ≈†√≠ma, Emilie Paliƒçkov√°, Jaroslav R√∂ssler and Pravoslav Kot√≠k. Czechoslovak Socialist Republic In 1918, after the creation of Czechoslovakia, UP≈† failed to obtain the ‚ÄúHigh School of Decorative Arts‚Äù status it was aiming for, but nevertheless it strengthened its autonomy. From 1920 it was led by an elected rector and new artistic personalities joined the faculty staff - Pavel Jan√°k, Franti≈°ek Kysela, Jaroslav Horejc, Vratislav Hugo Brunner and Helena Johnov√° and the art historians Anton√≠n Matƒõjƒçek, V√°clav Vil√©m ≈†tech and Jarom√≠r Peƒç√≠rka. In its early years of independent status, the school sought to create a ‚Äúnew national style‚Äù, though one still based on ornament in the tradition of Art Deco (the successor of Art Nouveau with theoretical manifestos from the beginning of the century). In 1925, the school represented Czechoslovakia at the International Exhibition of Decorative Arts in Paris, where it received both official recognition and criticism from the perspective of the European avant-garde. Under the growing international influence in the late 1920s, the school began to focus on Constructivism and Functionalism. The architect Otakar Novotn√Ω was strongly influenced by the German Bauhaus. Among the graduates of the interwar period were Jan Bauch, Cyril Bouda, Karel ƒåern√Ω, Toyen, Franti≈°ek Folt√Ωn, ƒΩudov√≠t Fulla, Mikul√°≈° Galanda, Franti≈°ek Gross, Franti≈°ek Hudeƒçek, Josef Kaplick√Ω, Anton√≠n Kybal, Zdenƒõk Sklen√°≈ô, Karel Souƒçek, Ladislav Sutnar, Karel Svolinsk√Ω, Ji≈ô√≠ Trnka and Ladislav Z√≠vr. Occupation and the postwar period Following the closure of the universities in 1939, the school replaced AVU until the end of WWII. It thus strengthened its position and by a 1946 Act acquired a new status and the name Vysok√° ≈°kola umƒõleckopr≈Ømyslov√° (The Academy of Applied Arts). A year later, in 1947, study was extended to five years, with studios across the departments of applied architecture, applied painting, applied graphic arts, textiles and clothing, applied sculpture, glassmaking, pottery and ceramics. After February 1948 After the communist putsch in February 1948, the school was also subjected to the influence of ideological and political dogmatism. The new teachers were subordinated to socialist realism. Nevertheless, the handicraft disciplines ‚Äì textiles, glass, metal and ceramics ‚Äì maintained their quality, and in the fifties celebrated figures joined the faculty ‚Äì such as Adolf Hoffmeister, Ars√©n Pohribn√Ω and Josef Wagner. The graduates of the period included Vladim√≠r Janou≈°ek, Vƒõra Janou≈°kov√°, Herm√≠na Melicharov√°, ƒåestm√≠r Kafka, Milan Grygar, Stanislav Kol√≠bal, Stanislav Libensk√Ω, Zdenƒõk Palcr, Adriena ≈†imotov√°, Ji≈ô√≠ John, Eva Kmentov√°, Kvƒõta Pacovsk√°, Olbram Zoubek, Jan Hlad√≠k, Jenny Hlad√≠kov√°, Vladim√≠r Kopeck√Ω, Ji≈ô√≠ Balcar and Ren√© Roub√≠ƒçek. One of the school‚Äôs successes was the awarding of the Czech pavilion at Expo 58 in Brussels. In the 1860s, the study period was extended to six years and intensive development took place especially in the art and craft disciplines. The Department of Industrial Design was also established at the former Zl√≠n School of Art, which was merged with the Academy in 1959. After 1968 The so-called ‚Äúconsolidation‚Äù influenced by the political ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù in the early 1970s also affected the school. A number of the personalities who had maintained its quality were obliged to leave. They included Franti≈°ek Muzika, Adolf Hoffmeister, Anton√≠n Kybal, Karel Svolinsk√Ω and Ji≈ô√≠ Trnka. The school was led by conformist Communist Party officials under the Rector Jan Simota (1973-1985) and his successor Jan Mikula. Today The school was reorganized after the Velvet Revolution of November 1989. At present (2014) it comprises five practical departments: architecture, design, fine arts, applied arts and graphics and a sixth, theoretical department teaching art history and aesthetics. In total there are 23 studios at the academy. The individual studios are led by respected experts. The Glass Studio is led by Rony Plesl, Ceramics by Maxim Velƒçovsk√Ω, K.O.V.

He set up the neurosurgical unit at the Atkinson Morley Hospital, was Britain's most prolific leucotomist (lobotomist), and president of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons. McKissock was born in Staines, Surrey. His parents were Alexander Cathie McKissock and Rae Wylie. His father, originally from Lanarkshire, was a manager in a linoleum factory who wrote crime fiction under the name of Alan Graham and invented a machine for cutting sheets of material. McKissock went to the City of London School and studied medicine at King's College London and St George's Hospital Medical School in London, qualifying in 1930. His first positions were at St George's Hospital, Maida Vale Hospital for Nervous Diseases (where he began his neurosurgical career) and Great Ormond Street Hospital. In 1936 McKissock visited Stockholm to study Swedish neurosurgeon Herbert Olivecrona's work, and then spent a year (1937-1938) on a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in the United States and Canada. By this time he had a young family, having married Rachel Jones in 1934. The couple had two daughters and a son.B.A. Bell 1996 Wylie McKissock - reminiscences of a commanding figure in British neurosurgery British Journal of Neurosurgery 10(1): 9-18. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, McKissock tried unsuccessfully to join the army as a neurosurgeon and instead was appointed to the neurosurgical unit at Leavesden Hospital. The unit later moved to the Atkinson Morley Hospital, Wimbledon, London, and for a time in 1944 was evacuated to Bath, Somerset. McKissock was appointed an OBE in 1946 for his neurosurgical work on casualties with brain injuries during the war. He became a consultant at St George's Hospital and was also given an appointment at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square, London, the neurology unit of University College Hospital. Thus at the Atkinson Morley Hospital, which he was to run until his retirement in 1971, he operated on patients from St George's Hospital, Maida Vale Hospital, Great Ormond Street, Queen Square and University College Hospital, as well as accepting referrals from other hospitals. While at the Atkinson Morley Hospital, McKissock developed an extensive practice of psychosurgery, travelling to psychiatric hospitals all over the south of England, Wales and the Midlands. In the 1940s he favoured the standard Freeman-Watts leucotomy where holes were drilled in the side of the head and an instrument swept through the white matter to sever connections between the frontal lobes and the deeper structures in the brain. Here he describes the Freeman-Watts leucotomy and the speed at which he operated: > \\"This is not a time-consuming operation. A competent team in a well- > organised mental hospital can do four such operations in 2-2¬Ω hours. The > actual bilateral prefrontal leucotomy can be done by a properly trained > neurosurgeon in six minutes and seldom take more than ten minutes.\\"W. > McKissock 1951 Rostral leucotomy. The Lancet, 21 July 1951: 91-94 In 1948, in an attempt to reduce the risks and damaging effects of leucotomy, he developed a technique of his own, the rostral leucotomy, where the frontal lobes were approached from the top of the head.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History The M-28‚ÄìSand River Bridge was designed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1939 to carry what was then M-94 over the Sand River. The Alpine Excavating Company of St. Ignace, Michigan, was awarded the construction contract, and soon began work on the substructural excavation. On June 16, 1939, a surge of water from Lake Superior flooded the abutment cofferdams, and extensive repairs had to be made. However, the bridge was completed later that year, and has carried traffic since. A later route change redesignated the roadway as part of M-28. Description The bridge carrying M-28 over the Sand River is a medium-span concrete bridge long and wide supported by concrete abutments. The span has a shallow arch, thick at the abutments and at the center of the span. It has a so-called rigid-frame construction, which was a new development by the highway department at the time the bridge was built. The bridge has concrete and steel guardrails and horizontal Art Moderne scoring on the sidewalls of the abutments. Despite its age, the bridge remains in excellent condition.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999, and is significant because it is one of only two remaining bridges built to an early 20th-century Michigan State Highway Department design standard. History The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) first published standard designs in 1907‚Äì1908. Among these standards were plans for steel plate through girder bridges intended for mid-size spans of . This style of girder bridge was used in the state with some moderate frequency between 1908 and 1915, including on this bridge, built in 1914. The bridge was built by Alger County or Au Train Township as part of construction work on what was then a secondary road running along the Lake Superior shoreline between Munising and Au Train. A 19th century-syle substructure was used to support the bridge, and the superstructure was fabricated in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by the Worden-Allen Company to the specifications of the MSHD bridge standards. The bridge reportedly cost $35,000. The road along the shore and the Au Train River bridge were later incorporated into M-94, which was redesignated as M-28 in the 1930s. M-28 was later rerouted, leaving the bridge once again on a secondary road. The bridge was later closed to vehicular traffic, and is currently partially blocked by 55-gallon drums and steel railing, limiting it to pedestrian and snowmobile traffic. Description Sidewall of bridge The Old M-94‚ÄìAu Train River Bridge uses a span MSHD standard through girder bridge design to carry Wolkoff Road over the Au Train River. The structure has a single plate girder span, with a steel stringer approach span on each end. The stringers are supported by concrete abutments and concrete-filled steel cylinder piers. The main span consistes of two through girders, joined by four I-beams underneath.

In terms of the Constitution of South Africa, \\"No one may be evicted from their home, or have their home demolished, without an order of court made after considering all the relevant circumstances. No legislation may permit arbitrary evictions.\\"s 26(3). PIE sets out the procedure to be followed in the case of such evictions.Mostert & Pope 217. In Port Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers,2005 (1) SA 217 (CC). the Constitutional Court found that it \\"expressly requires the court to infuse elements of grace and compassion into the formal structures of the law.\\"Para 37.  Eviction procedure  The eviction procedure excludes the rei vindicatio and other common-law remedies for the vindication of ownership rights. PIE has application also where the occupation was lawful to begin with but became unlawful later.Ndlovu v Ngcobo; Bekker and Another v Jika 2003 (1) SA 113 (SCA). Different procedures are set out under PIE for private owners,s 4. urgent applicationss 5. and organs of state.s 6. Notice must be given within fourteen days of the hearing and should include the following: * notification that proceedings have been instituted; * the date of the hearing; * the grounds for the proceedings; and * information as to the right of appearance. In the case of private owners,s 4. the court will consider the length of the occupation. If it has been less than six months, an eviction order will be made only if it is \\"just and equitable\\" to do so, \\"after considering all the relevant circumstances, including the rights and needs of the elderly, children, disabled persons and households headed by women.\\"s 4(6). If it has been more than six months, the eviction order must still be just and equitable, but the circumstances to consider are compounded by the question of \\"whether land has been [...] or can reasonably be made available [...] for the relocation of the unlawful occupier.\\" An exception to this is \\"where the land is sold in a sale of execution pursuant to a mortgage.\\"s 4(7). Urgent applicationss 5. are granted where harm is eminent \\"to any person or property if the unlawful occupier is not forthwith evicted from the land,\\",s 5(1)(a). where \\"the likely hardship to the owner or any other affected person [...] exceeds the likely hardship to the unlawful occupier,\\"s 5(1)(b). and where no other effective remedy is available.s 5(1)(c).  Case law  In Residents of Joe Slovo Community v Thubelisha Homes,2010 (3) SA 454 (CC). an application was brought by the authorities in Cape Town seeking the eviction of the persons in the Joe Slovo informal settlement under of PIE,s 5. arguing that the property was needed for the development of affordable housing for poor people. The High Court granted the order, and the residents appealed to the Constitutional Court on the grounds that they were not unlawful occupiers, having obtained the consent of the authorities,s 6(1)(a).In terms of s 1(ii), consent may be \\"express or tacit [...] in writing or otherwise.\\" and therefore could not be evicted. The court granted the eviction but ordered that alternative accommodation be provided to the occupiers. In Port Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers, the municipality sought an eviction order against unlawful occupiers of municipal land, at the behest of adjacent land owners. The High Court granted the order, but on appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeals the order was quashed. The Municipality, in turn, appealed to the Constitutional Court, which held that there is no unqualified constitutional duty on local government to provide alternative housing in terms of PIEs 6(3). \\"In general terms, however,\\" wrote Sachs J, \\"a court should be reluctant to grant an eviction against relatively settled occupiers unless it is satisfied that a reasonable alternative is available, even if only as an interim measure pending ultimate access to housing in the formal housing programme.\\"233G-H. In Blue Moonlight Properties v Occupiers of Saratoga Avenue,2009 (1) SA 470 (W). the respondent, a private landowner, served a notice of eviction on the occupiers. They resisted, claiming protection under PIE and alleging that they were entitled to continue their occupation until the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality provided alternative accommodation. The City disputed this duty; the respondents argued that its policy was arbitrary and discriminatory. The issue, then, was whether private landowners are obliged to provide alternative accommodation to unlawful occupiers in terms of PIE,s 4. or whether the burden should fall on the city. The court found that it should balance the rights of property owners under the Constitutions 25. with those of indigents and occupiers,s 26. and ruled that the landowners' right to equalitys 9. would be infringed if the state were to burden them with providing alternative accommodation without compensation. The obligation to provide access was the City's, and the City could not transfer that obligation to private landowners. The court ordered compensatory relief to Blue Moonlight Properties and found that the City was in breach of its constitutional duty to provide adequate housing on a progressive basis.s 9. It was obliged to make monetary payment each month until such accommodation was found.

Known for his work on plague and rabies, he was the director of the Pasteur Institute of Iran from 1946 to 1961 and then head of the service of epidemiology in the Pasteur Institute of Paris. Biography After completing secondary school in Verdun in 1924, Marcel Baltazard began studying medicine in Paris, determined to become a clinician. In 1928, a friend of Marcel Baltazard, C. Desportes, suggested that he join him in Emile Brumpt's laboratory of parasitology (medical faculty in Paris), where he became an assistant in 1931. In June 1932, Georges Blanc, to whom Emile Roux entrusted the foundation of Institut Pasteur in Morocco, invited him to prepare his doctoral thesis on the Marrakech's bilharziosis focus. From December 1932 to May 1933, in the laboratory of parasitology at the medical faculty (Paris), he studied the spotted fever. He improved his microbiological technique in Ren√© Legroux's laboratory in Institut Pasteur. He attended his medical thesis Contribution to the study of the vesical bilharziosis in Morocco. He then rejoined Georges Blanc at Institut Pasteur of Casablanca, where he did research on the transmission of typhus, sodoku, spirochaete, recurrent fevers. In 1935, he received the Desportes Prize from the French Academy of Medicine. In 1937, Georges Blanc and Marcel Baltazard create from infected fleas' excrements a new vaccine against typhus. From 1942 to 1945, he participated in the Italian, French and German campaigns as the head doctor in the first group of Moroccan Tabors-Goums. Back in Morocco in 1945, he was then sent by Ren√© Legroux on a temporary mission at Institut Pasteur of Iran. There he prepared a new contract with the Iranian government that will sign Louis- Pasteur Vallery-Radot, Ren√© Legroux and Antoine Lacassagne on behalf of Institut Pasteur. In 1946, he became the director of the Institut Pasteur of Iran, where he re-planned the scientific structures and architecture. There he organized a national campaign of mass vaccination against smallpox and tuberculosis, the latter with the help of WHO and UNICEF. He collaborated with French, American and Soviet research institutes and also founded an agricultural centre for the social rehabilitation of leprous population. Marcel Baltazard at the Pasteur Institute of Iran (around 1955) In 1947, he studied a plague epidemic in rural environment in Hamadan Akanlu village, despite the absence of rats on these high plateaux. Studies pointed out the permanence of infection in these foci, and the role played in this permanence by the presence of rodents showing a high resistance to infection. He came to the conclusion that it was necessary to look for a real plague reservoir not among sensitive species eradicated by infection, but among the semi-resistant species that survive. To prove this theory, WHO set up a research campaign associated with Institut Pasteur of Iran. In 1950, he became WHO' rabies committee expert. He elaborated a testing program of a new serum antirabic, purified and concentrated (called hyperimmun) in the USA. This has paved a new way of using serum antirabic. In 1954, he was awarded the Bellion Prize by the French Academy of Sciences. In 1956, he becomes member of WHO's expert committee for the plague. In 1958, Baltazard left Institut Pasteur of Iran and was the adviser of his Iranian colleague, Mahdi Ghodsi, until 1966. In 1961, he elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Medicine, Paris. In 1966, in the Institut Pasteur in Paris, he remained in contact with his Iranian team associated with WHO and Russian and American researchers. In 1968, he became departmental head of the new medical service of epidemiology of transmittable diseases, researching and teaching at the same time. He was managed the organization of epidemiology courses. He also continued the research program previously set up in Brazil, Peru, Burma, and Mauritania, with the prospect to extend investigations to other countries. He died in Paris on September 1, 1971.

The 308th Rifle Division was formed in accordance with Order Number 0044 of the Siberian Military District dated 21 March 1942.Armchair general It was formed at Omsk in the Siberian Military District, using 20% Red Army men (active duty), 25% returning wounded veterans, 25% reservists from industry, and 30% new recruits from the classes of 1922-23. Most of the recruits and reservists came from the Omsk and Krasnoyarsk oblasts. When the division left for the west it had 12,133 officers and men assigned. The division remained in the Siberian Military District until May 1942 until it was moved to the west. In late May, the division was assigned to the 8th Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. On 1 June 1942, the division, still with the 8th Reserve Army, was at Saratov.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album made the top spot in the first edition and the same band's Revolver consistently made the top five in each edition of the book. Background In 1987, radio presenter Paul Gambaccini asked approximately 80 critics and disc jockeys from the United Kingdom and United States to list their ten greatest albums of all time. From these lists, he compiled the \\"Top 100 Albums\\" which was subsequently published by Pavilion Books in 1987. In 1993, Colin Larkin was approached by the now defunct Today newspaper to update this list, which was published in the newspaper. As a consequence Larkin suggested the idea of a Top 1000 albums book to his publisher. Unlike the Gambaccini list, Larkin wanted to compile a list from votes cast by \\"broader opinion\\", and in keeping with the genres used in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music. Larkin set about polling several thousand people via a printed voting form, left in record shops and sent to schools and universities. The result was the first edition of the All Time Top 1000 Albums, published in 1994. In 1998 the second edition was published by Virgin Books using the continuing votes received over the previous four years. As a result of the publicity garnered by the encyclopedia and the first edition, Larkin was able to ask for votes during his numerous radio broadcasts for BBC GLR, now BBC London 94.9. He collected 100,000 votes and the 2nd edition sold 38,000 copies. In 1999 Virgin published a smaller pocket edition, followed by a 3rd edition published in 2000, by which time the ongoing poll had reached over 200,000 votes cast. In September 2000, BBC News reported the \\"head to head\\" battle between the Beatles and Radiohead, the two bands who took the top four positions on the list.

Biography Ivanov entered Saint Petersburg University in 1897, where he studied Chinese and Manchu. After graduating in 1902 he went to China for further study for two years, and on his return in 1904 he went on a study tour of England, France and Germany for a year. He was appointed a lecturer in Chinese at Saint Petersburg University in 1904, and he was made a professor Chinese and Manchu in 1915. In 1922 Ivanov was appointed as a senior dragoman (interpreter) at the Soviet embassy in Beijing. In the summer of 1937, during the Great Purge, Ivanov was arrested and executed.  Scholarship  Ivanov was the first scholar to study the printed books and manuscripts written in the as yet undeciphered Tangut script that had been found in the abandoned city of Khara-Khoto in Inner Mongolia by Pyotr Kozlov in 1908‚Äì1909. In autumn 1909 as many as 24,000 volumes of books and manuscripts in Chinese, Tangut and other languages, together with numerous archaeological artefacts, had been sent to the Russian Geographical Society in Saint Petersburg by Kozlov. The books and manuscripts were subsequently moved to the Asiatic Museum of the Academy of Sciences (now the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences). Together with V. L. Kotvich, a scholar of Mongolian and Manchu, Ivanov worked on the identification and preservation of the books and manuscripts from Khara-Khoto. Among these books Ivanov discovered a bilingual Chinese-Tangut glossary called the Pearl in the Palm () which he realised was the key to deciphering the Tangut language. He later discovered three monolingual Tangut dictionaries and glossaries: Homophones (); Sea of Characters (); and Mixed Characters (). Based on the Pearl in the Palm and the other dictionaries, Ivanov was able to compile a dictionary of about 3,000 Tangut characters. The dictionary was completed in 1918, and deposited at the Asiatic Museum, where it remained until 1922, when Ivanov took it back. Due to the unstable political situation at the time, the dictionary was never published, and was not even known to Ivanov's most famous student, Nikolai Aleksandrovich Nevsky, whose posthumous work, Tangut Philology (1960), laid the bedrock for modern Tangut scholarship. Ivanov's dictionary, which was at his home at the time of his arrest and execution in 1937, has never been seen since.

In this position the white camel on h1 can move to g4 or i4; the white wildebeest can move to f3, f4, h3, or h4. Wildebeest chess is a chess variant created by R. Wayne Schmittberger in 1987. The Wildebeest board is 11√ó10 squares. Besides the standard chess pieces, each side has two camels and one \\"wildebeest\\" - a piece which may move as either a camel or a knight. The inventor's intent was \\"to balance the number of 'riders'‚Äîpieces that move along open lines‚Äîwith the number of 'leapers'‚Äîpieces that jump\\". (So for each side, two knights, two camels, and a wildebeest balance two rooks, two bishops, and a queen.) The game was played regularly in the (now defunct) correspondence game club NOST. Game rules Pieces and pawns move and capture the same as they do in standard chess, except for two new pieces, and the pawn's ability to advance to the players' fifth in a single move from either their second or third ranks. Wildebeest chess differs from the standard game in that a win can be achieved either by checkmate or stalemate. In both cases the losing side has no legal moves. =Camel= The camel is a (1,3)-leaper fairy chess piece. It moves and captures like an elongated move of a chess knight ‚Äì jumping in a 2√ó4 (squares) rectangular pattern over any intervening men. Each camel is thus limited to squares of one color. =Wildebeest= The wildebeest moves and captures as a camel and a chess knight. =Pawns= * A pawn has the option of advancing one, two, or three squares on its first move. * Pawns that have advanced one square (i.e., white pawns on the third , and black pawns on the eighth rank) have the option of advancing one or two squares. * Pawns that have advanced two or more squares (i.e., white pawns on the fourth rank or beyond, and black pawns on the seventh rank or beyond) may advance only one step at a time. * En passant captures are possible. A pawn can be captured en passant if it has advanced two or three squares in a single move, and an enemy pawn on an adjacent file could have captured it, had it moved a lesser number of squares instead. As in chess, the option to capture en passant must be taken immediately, else the right is forfeited. * A pawn may promote only to a queen or wildebeest. =Castling= Normal conventions apply when castling, with the only difference that the castling player can choose to slide his king one, two, three, or four squares. As in chess, the castling rook finishes on the opposite side of the king on the square adjacent. See also * Parallel worlds chess‚Äîanother chess variant by R.

It is found on members of the genera Allocasuarina, Acacia and some exotic species. Franz Sieber first described this species as Loranthus congener in 1829, before Philippe √âdouard L√©on Van Tieghem gave it its current binomial name in 1894. It grows as shrubby plant, with either an erect or pendant (drooping) habit, from a tree branch or trunk. It is attached to the host tree by a globular woody base. The stems and foliage are smooth. The thick leathery leaves are spear-shaped (lanceolate) to oval or obovate and measure in length and across. Flowers can be seen at any time of year. The diameter round fruit ripen over the summer (December to February), and the single seed within is contained in a sticky membrane. The principal host plant of the variable mistletoe is the black sheoak (Allocasuarina littoralis) also forest oak (A. torulosa), gossamer wattle (Acacia floribunda), white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora), prickly-leaved tea tree (M. styphelioides), prickly-leaved paperbark (M. nodosa), snow-in-summer (M. linariifolia), green native cascarilla (Croton verreauxii), red olive plum (Elaeodendron australe), as well as introduced trees such as peach and plum trees, pear trees, and oleander (Nerium oleander). It is only occasionally on gum trees such as Eucalyptus obtusifolia and smooth-barked apple Angophora costata. The mistletoebird (Dicaeum hirundinaceum) eats the fruit. Scale insect species such as Ceroplastes cerciferus, C. rubens, and Aspidiotus aurantii can attack the plant. The seed immediately begins to germinate and soon penetrates the vascular system of the tree and creates a physiological connection with the xylem of the new host. From that point, the seedling begins to obtain water and mineral nutrients from the host.

Facts  For a mortgage to be valid, there must be a legal or natural obligation to which the hypothecation is accessory. In Kilburn, a husband had, before his marriage, passed and registered a notarial bond for ¬£500 as a second charge on all his property in favour of his wife.  Judgment  The court found as a fact that, although the bond purported to secure a sum of ¬£500 which the husband had verbally promised to pay his wife, it was not a serious promise, and there was therefore no intention to pay that sum. The intention of the spouses, in agreeing to the notarial bond, was only to give a preferential claim on the sum if the husband were to be declared insolvent. The principal debt was invalid, and so, in turn, was the notarial bond. As, therefore, there was no legal obligation secured by the bond, the wife could not, on the insolvency of her husband, claim in a concursus creditorum on the bond.

In a brief racing career which lasted from May to July 1955, Phil Drake ran five times and won three races, becoming the fifth and last horse to win both The Derby and the Grand Prix de Paris. Background Phil Drake, a brown horse with a white stripe was bred in France by his owner Mme Leon \\"Suzy\\" Volterra. His sire Admiral Drake was a top class racehorse who won the Grand Prix de Paris in 1934. Phil Drake's dam, Philippa, was a successful racehorse who also produced the Prix Morny winner Bozet. Phil Drake was trained by Fran√ßois Mathet at Chantilly. Racing career =1955: three-year-old season= Phil Drake was a slow maturing colt who did not race as a two-year-old. He made his first racecourse appearance in the spring of 1955 when he ran second in the Prix Juign√©, finishing strongly and narrowly failing to catch his stable companion Datour. The colt developed respiratory problems after the race and his connections considered \\"scratching\\" him (withdrawing his entry) from the Derby. In May, however, he won the three-year-old division of the Prix La Rochette at Longchamp in impressive style to establish himself as a Derby contender. Before the news of his victory reached England some \\"astute punters\\" backed him for the Derby at odds of up to 50/1. In the Derby, he started at 100/8 in a field of twenty-three and was ridden by Freddie Palmer, in front of a crowd estimated at 200,000 including the Queen. Phil Drake was held up by Palmer in the early stages and was not in the first fifteen at half way. In the straight he produced a sustained run to move through the field, but was still only sixth entering the final furlong as the 100/1 Irish colt Panaslipper went clear. In the closing stages Phil Drake was switched to the inside and produced a \\"tremendous finishing burst\\" to overtake Panaslipper and win going away by one and a half lengths, with the 11/4 favourite, Acropolis a further three lengths back in third. Later in June he won the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp, beating the Prix du Jockey Club winner Rapace, and becoming the fifth and last horse to win the Derby-Grand Prix double, following Gladiateur, Cremorne, Spearmint and My Love. On his final start, Phil Drake ran in Britain's most valuable race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot for which he started 8/11 favourite. After making a brief effort in the straight he faded to finish sixth of the ten runners behind Vimy. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Phil Drake an \\"average\\" Derby winner.Randall, J and Morris, T. Portway Press, 1999, p. 205 Timeform rated Phil Drake on a mark of 132. A rating of 130 is considered the mark of an above average European Group One winner.

It is native to eastern Asia, including Taiwan, Japan, Korea, southeastern Asia, and India, and eastern Australia. The fern is present in the southeastern United States and Puerto Rico as an introduced species.Munger, Gregory T. 2005. Lygodium spp. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory (Producer). Retrieved 11-07-2011. Description This fern produces a creeping stem from which grow very long leaves, the longest exceeding . The leaves have rachises, which are vine-like and may climb other vegetation. What appear to be individual leaves sprouting from the twining rachis are actually leaflets, which are smaller segments from the main leaf. There are two types of leaflets, sterile and fertile. The sterile frond has lance-shaped segments. The fertile frond has more intricately divided, fringed segments. It is lined with sporangia on the edges.Lygodium japonicum. Flora of North America. Retrieved 11-07-2011. The plant reproduces via spores and spreads vegetatively via underground rhizomes. Cultivation An introduced species in North America, Japanese climbing fern was first recorded as being established in Georgia in 1903. In the southeastern United States this plant is now considered an invasive weed of economic and ecological significance.Minogue, P. J., et al. (2010).

It grows in moist, swampy habitat, especially in disturbed areas. The presence of species such as the small-spike false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrica), royal fern (Osmunda spectabilis), resurrection fern (Pleopeltis polypodioides ssp. polypodioides), and toothed midsorus fern (Blechnum serrulatum) indicates the likely presence of this species. During controlled burns of wooded areas this fern may act as a \\"fuel ladder\\", which would allow the flames to climb into the canopy and destroy trees. After burns the fern can quickly grow back, so it cannot be controlled by fire.Minogue, P. J., et al. Biology and control of Japanese Climbing Fern (Lygodium japonicum).

Topics of interest include accessibility of the collection, acquisition of materials, arrangement and finding tools, the book trade, the influence of the physical properties of the different writing materials, language distribution, role in education, rates of literacy, budgets, staffing, libraries for specially targeted audiences, architectural merit, patterns of usage, and the role of libraries in a nation's cultural heritage, and the role of government, church or private sponsorship. Since the 1960s, issues of computerization and digitization have arisen. Library history is the academic discipline devoted to the study of the history of libraries; it is a subfield of library science and of history. Early libraries Tablet from the Library of Ashurbanipal containing part of the Epic of Gilgamesh The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing ‚Äì the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in temple rooms in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. About an inch thick, tablets came in various shapes and sizes. Mud-like clay was placed in the wooden frames, and the surface was smoothed for writing and allowed to dry until damp. After being inscribed, the clay dried in the sun, or for a harder finish, was baked in a kiln. For storage, tablets could be stacked on edge, side by side, the contents described by a title written on the edge that faced out and was readily seen. The first libraries appeared five thousand years ago in Southwest Asia's Fertile Crescent, an area that ran from Mesopotamia to the Nile in Africa. Known as the cradle of civilization, the Fertile Crescent was the birthplace of writing, sometime before 3000 BC. (Murray, Stuart A.P.) These archives, which mainly consisted of the records of commercial transactions or inventories, mark the end of prehistory and the start of history.Renfrew, Colin (2008) Prehistory The Making of the Human Mind, New York: Modern Library. Things were much the same in the government and temple records on papyrus of Ancient Egypt. The earliest discovered private archives were kept at Ugarit; besides correspondence and inventories, texts of myths may have been standardized practice-texts for teaching new scribes. There is also evidence of libraries at Nippur about 1900 BC and those at Nineveh about 700 BC showing a library classification system.The American International Encyclopedia, New York: J. J. Little & Ives, 1954; Volume IX Over 30,000 clay tablets from the Library of Ashurbanipal have been discovered at Nineveh, providing modern scholars with an amazing wealth of Mesopotamian literary, religious and administrative work. Among the findings were the Enuma Elish, also known as the Epic of Creation,\\"Epic of Creation\\", in Dalley, Stephanie. Myths from Mesopotamia. Oxford, 1989; pp. 233‚Äì81 which depicts a traditional Babylonian view of creation, the Epic of Gilgamesh,\\"Epic of Gilgamesh\\", in Dalley, Stephanie. Myths from Mesopotamia. Oxford, 1989; pp. 50‚Äì135 a large selection of \\"omen texts\\" including Enuma Anu Enlil which \\"contained omens dealing with the moon, its visibility, eclipses, and conjunction with planets and fixed stars, the sun, its corona, spots, and eclipses, the weather, namely lightning, thunder, and clouds, and the planets and their visibility, appearance, and stations\\",Van De Mieroop, Marc (2007). A History of the Ancient Near East ca. 3000‚Äì323 BC. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing. p. 263 and astronomic/astrological texts, as well as standard lists used by scribes and scholars such as word lists, bilingual vocabularies, lists of signs and synonyms, and lists of medical diagnoses. The tablets were stored in a variety of containers such as wooden boxes, woven baskets of reeds, or clay shelves. The \\"libraries\\" were cataloged using colophons, which are a publisher's imprint on the spine of a book, or in this case a tablet. The colophons stated the series name, the title of the tablet, and any extra information the scribe needed to indicate. Eventually, the clay tablets were organized by subject and size. Unfortunately, due to limited bookshelf space, when more tablets were added to the library, older ones were removed, which is why some tablets are missing from the excavated cities in Mesopotamia.Weitemeyer, M. (1956). Archive and library technique in ancient Mesopotamia. Libri: International Journal of Libraries, 6(3). 217‚Äì238. According to legend, mythical philosopher Laozi was keeper of books in the earliest library in China, which belonged to the Imperial Zhou dynasty.Mukherjee, A. K. (1966). Librarianship: Its Philosophy and History. Asia Publishing House. p. 86 Also, evidence of catalogues found in some destroyed ancient libraries illustrates the presence of librarians. Classical period Persia at the time of the Achaemenid Empire (550‚Äì330 BC) was home to some outstanding libraries. Those libraries within the kingdom had two major functions: the first came from the need to keep the records of administrative documents including transactions, governmental orders, and budget allocation within and between the Satrapies and the central ruling State.Rajabi, Parviz. 1381. The lost Milleniums, Vol 3, Toos Publication, The second function was to collect precious resources on different subjects of science and sets of principles e.g. medical science, astronomy, history, geometry and philosophy. In 1933 an impressive collection of clay tablets discovered by the University of Chicago in Persepolis revealed the strong tendency of the Achaemenids to record, classify and store their documents as the backbone of their ruling system throughout a vast territory. The contents of these baked tablets written in Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian vary from records of sales, taxes, payments, treasury details to remarkable social, artistic and philosophical aspects of ordinary life in the Empire. These uniquely important tablets, known as the Persepolis Fortification Archive, are the property of Iran. A part of this impressive library archive is now kept in Iran and a great proportion of it is in the hands of the Chicago Oriental Institute as a long-term loan for the purpose of studying, analysing and translating. Some scholars during the early Islamic period declared that there were a number of large libraries in Iran before the conquest of Alexander III of Macedon. One of them is believed to be in an ancient city called Estakhr located near Persepolis. In the 10th century, Ibn al-Nadim, a well-known Muslim bibliographer, stated that following the conquest, the majority of the resources in different streams of science were taken from Persia's main libraries to Egypt. They were later translated into Latin, Egyptian, Coptic and Greek and used as a remarkable body of science in the Library of Alexandria. The rest is said to have been set on fire and burnt by Alexander militants. Some evidence indicates that a sizeable building in Isfahan, Jey, named Sarouyeh, was used by Iran's ancient dynasties to store the enormous number of precious books and manuscripts. The primary purpose of such a monument was to protect the books from damages and hazards caused by natural disasters and wars. At least three Islamic scholars, Al Biruni, Abu Ma øshar, and Hamza al-Isfahani, mentioned this hidden library in their works. They had been real observers of some of the revealed books coming out of the hidden library ruins. Observers claimed that most of the manuscripts were written on the bark of a tree called Touz or Khadang. It seems that some rare and valuable books from this treasury were baled and transferred to Baghdad for later reading and translating. As reported by observers, at the time of unearthing the Library, the alphabet used in the manuscripts was unknown to the ordinary people.Abu Rayhan Al Birouni, The Chronology of the Ancient Nations, Translated and edited by Eduard Sachau, 2004 reprint: Kessinger Publishing, Homayoun Farrokh, Rokn Aldin, The History of Books and Libraries in Iran, Honar va Mardom Magazine, 1347 Artistic rendering of the Library of Alexandria, based on some archaeological evidence The Library of Alexandria, in Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library of the ancient world.Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Sagan, C 1980, \\"Episode 1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean\\" It flourished under the patronage of the Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323‚Äì283 BC) or during the reign of his son Ptolemy II (283‚Äì246 BC).Phillips, Heather A., \\"The Great Library of Alexandria?\\" . Library Philosophy and Practice, August 2010 An early organization system was in effect at Alexandria. During Sassanid Empire collection of books drew the attention of rulers and priests. Priests intended to gather the spread and unknown Zoroastrianism manuscripts and rulers were keen on collection and promotion of science. Many Zoroastrian temples were accompanied by a library that was designed to collect and promote religious content. One of the main outcomes of rulers‚Äô interest in consolidating the science in the country was the establishment of Gundeshapur Scientific Centre being composed of a library, a hospital and an accompanying academy at the time of the King Shapur I. For the sake of enriching the existing Library resources, ambassadors were sent to widespread geographical regions e.g. China, Rome and India to inscribe the manuscripts, codices, and books; translated them to Pahlavi from diverse languages e.g. Sanskrit, Greek and Syriac and brought them to Academy of Gundishapur. The Library of Celsus in Ephesus, Anatolia, now part of Sel√ßuk, Turkey was built in honor of the Roman Senator Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus (completed in AD 135) by Celsus' son, Tiberius Julius Aquila Polemaeanus (consul, 110). The library was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus. The library's ruins were hidden under debris of the city of Ephesus that was deserted in early Middle Ages. In 1903, Austrian excavations led to this hidden heap of rubble that had collapsed during an earthquake. The donator's son built the library to honor his father's memory and construction began around 113 or 114. Presently, visitors only see the remains of the library's facade.Strocka, Volke, M. (2003). The Celsus Library. Ancient libraries of Anatolia: libraries of Hatusha, Pergamon, Ephesus, Nysa.(Ankara): Middle East Technical University Library, 2003, pp. 33‚Äì43. Private or personal libraries made up of written books (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in archives) appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. The celebrated book collectors of Hellenistic Antiquity were listed in the late 2nd century in Deipnosophistae. All these libraries were Greek; the cultivated Hellenized diners in Deipnosophistae pass over the libraries of Rome in silence. By the time of Augustus there were public libraries near the forums of Rome: there were libraries in the Porticus Octaviae near the Theatre of Marcellus, in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and in the Ulpian Library in the Forum of Trajan. The state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the Roman Forum and the Capitoline Hill. Private libraries appeared during the late republic: Seneca inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (armaria) of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: \\"by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house (domus).Seneca, De tranquillitate animi ix.4‚Äì7. Libraries were amenities suited to a villa, such as Cicero's at Tusculum, Maecenas's several villas, or Pliny the Younger's, all described in surviving letters. At the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, apparently the villa of Caesar's father-in-law, the Greek library has been partly preserved in volcanic ash; archaeologists speculate that a Latin library, kept separate from the Greek one, may await discovery at the site. Remains of the Library of Celsus at Ephesus In the West, the first public libraries were established under the Roman Empire as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor. Rome's first public library was established by Asinius Pollio. Pollio was a lieutenant of Julius Caesar and one of his most ardent supporters. After his military victory in Illyria, Pollio felt he had enough fame and fortune to create what Julius Caesar had sought for a long time: a public library to increase the prestige of Rome and rival the one in Alexandria.Casson, L. (2001). Libraries in the Ancient World. New Haven: Yale University Press; Ewald, L. A. (2004). Library Culture in Ancient Rome, 100 B.C. ‚Äì A.D. 400. Kentucky Libraries, 68(1), 9‚Äì11; Buchanan, S. (2012). Designing the Research Commons: Classical Models for School Libraries. School Libraries Worldwide, 18(1), 56‚Äì69. Pollios's library, the Anla Libertatis,Ewald, 2004, p. 9 which was housed in the Atrium Libertatis, was centrally located near the Forum Romanum. It was the first to employ an architectural design that separated works into Greek and Latin. All subsequent Roman public libraries will have this design.Casson, 2001, p. 80 At the conclusion of Rome's civil wars following the death of Marcus Antonius in 30 BC, the Emperor Augustus sought to reconstruct many of Rome's damaged buildings. During this construction, Augustus created two more public libraries. The first was the library of the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine, often called the Palatine library, and the second was the library of the Porticus of Octaviae.Casson, 2001, p. 81; Buchanan, 2012, p. 61 Two more libraries were added by the Emperor Tiberius on Palatine Hill and one by Vespasian after 70. Vespasian's library was constructed in the Forum of Vespasian, also known as the Forum of Peace, and became one of Rome's principal libraries. The Bibliotheca Pacis was built along the traditional model and had two large halls with rooms for Greek and Latin libraries containing the works of Galen and Lucius Aelius.Casson, 2001, p. 84; Buchanan, 2012, pp. 61‚Äì62 One of the best preserved was the ancient Ulpian Library built by the Emperor Trajan. Completed in 112/113 AD, the Ulpian Library was part of Trajan's Forum built on the Capitoline Hill. Trajan's Column separated the Greek and Latin rooms which faced each other.Ewald, 2004, p. 10; Buchanan, 2012, p. 62; Casson, p. 61 The structure was approximately fifty feet high with the peak of the roof reaching almost seventy feet.Houston, G. W. (2008). Tiberius and the Libraries: Public Book Collections and Library Buildings in the Early Roman Empire. Libraries & the Cultural Record, 43, 247‚Äì269. Unlike the Greek libraries, readers had direct access to the scrolls, which were kept on shelves built into the walls of a large room. Reading or copying was normally done in the room itself. The surviving records give only a few instances of lending features. Most of the large Roman baths were also cultural centres, built from the start with a library, a two-room arrangement with one room for Greek and one for Latin texts. Libraries were filled with parchment scrolls as at Library of Pergamum and on papyrus scrolls as at Alexandria: the export of prepared writing materials was a staple of commerce. There were a few institutional or royal libraries which were open to an educated public (such as the Serapeum collection of the Library of Alexandria, once the largest library in the ancient world), but on the whole collections were private. In those rare cases where it was possible for a scholar to consult library books there seems to have been no direct access to the stacks. In all recorded cases the books were kept in a relatively small room where the staff went to get them for the readers, who had to consult them in an adjoining hall or covered walkway. Most of the works in catalogs were of a religious nature, such as volumes of the Bible or religious service books. \\"In a number of cases the library was entirely theological and liturgical, and in the greater part of the libraries the non-ecclesiastical content did not reach one third of the total\\"Beddie, J. (1930). The Ancient Classics in the Mediaeval Libraries. Speculum, 5(1), 3‚Äì20. In addition to these types of works, in some libraries during that time Plato was especially popular. In the early Middle Ages, Aristotle was more popular. Additionally, there was quite a bit of censoring within libraries of the time; many works that were \\"scientific and metaphysical\\" were not included in the majority of libraries during that time period. Latin authors were better represented within library holdings and Roman works were less represented. Cicero was also an especially popular author along with the histories of Sallust. Additionally, Virgil was universally represented at most of the medieval libraries of the time. One of the most popular was Ovid, mentioned by approximately twenty French catalogues and nearly thirty German ones. Surprisingly, old Roman textbooks on grammar were still being used at that time. In 213 BC during the reign of Emperor Qin Shi Huang most books were ordered destroyed. The Han Dynasty (202 BC ‚Äì 220 AD) reversed this policy for replacement copies, and created three imperial libraries. Liu Xin a curator of the imperial library was the first to establish a library classification system and the first book notation system. At this time the library catalog was written on scrolls of fine silk and stored in silk bags. Important new technological innovations include the use of paper and block printing. Wood-block printing, facilitated the large-scale reproduction of classic Buddhist texts which were avidly collected in many private libraries that flourished during the T'ang Dynasty (618‚Äì906 AD). The Ming Dynasty in 1407 founded the imperial library, the Wen Yuan Pavilion. It also sponsored the massive compilation of the Yongle Encyclopedia, containing 11,000 volumes including copies of over 7000 books. It was soon destroyed, but similar very large compilations appeared in 1725 and 1772. Late Antiquity Malatestiana Library of Cesena, the first European civic library During the Late Antiquity and Middle Ages periods, there was no Rome of the kind that ruled the Mediterranean for centuries and spawned the culture that produced twenty-eight public libraries in the urbs Roma.Bischoff, B. and Gorman, M. (1994). Manuscripts and libraries in the age of Charlemagne. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The empire had been divided then later re-united again under Constantine the Great who moved the capital of the Roman Empire in 330 AD to the city of Byzantium which was renamed Constantinople.Staikos, K. K. (2004). The history of the library in Western civilization. New Castle, Del.: Oak Knoll Press, p. 12 The Roman intellectual culture that flourished in ancient times was undergoing a transformation as the academic world moved from laymen to Christian clergy.Staikos, 2007, p. 8 As the West crumbled, books and libraries flourished and flowed east toward the Byzantine Empire. There, four different types of libraries were established: imperial, patriarchal, monastic, and private.Papademetriou, G. C. (2000). \\"The Patriarchal libraries of Constantinople\\". Greek Orthodox Theological Review, 45(1‚Äì4), 171‚Äì190. Each had its own purpose and, as a result, their survival varied. Christianity was a new force in Europe and many of the faithful saw Hellenistic culture as pagan. As such, many classical Greek works, written on scrolls, were left to decay as only Christian texts were thought fit for preservation in a codex, the progenitor of the modern book.Lyons, M. (2011). Books: A living history. London: Thames and Hudson, pp. 35‚Äì36. In the East, however, this was not the case as many of these classical Greek and Roman texts were copied. \\"[F]ormerly paper was rare and expensive, so every spare page of available books was pressed into use. Thus a seventeenth-century edition of the Ignatian epistles, in Mar Saba, had copied onto its last pages, probably in the early eighteenth century, a passage allegedly from the letters of Clement of Alexandria\\".Smith, M. (1960). Monasteries and Their Manuscripts. Archaeology, 13(3), 172‚Äì77. Old manuscripts were also used to bind new books because of the costs associated with paper and also because of the scarcity of new paper. In Byzantium, much of this work devoted to preserving Hellenistic thought in codex form was performed in scriptoriums by monks. p. 320. While monastic library scriptoriums flourished throughout the East and West, the rules governing them were generally the same.; . Barren and sun-lit rooms (because candles were a source of fire) were major features of the scriptorium that was both a model of production and monastic piety. Monks scribbled away for hours a day, interrupted only by meals and prayers. With such production, medieval monasteries began to accumulate large libraries. These libraries were devoted solely to the education of the monks and were seen as essential to their spiritual development. Although most of these texts that were produced were Christian in nature, many monastic leaders saw common virtues in the Greek classics. As a result, many of these Greek works were copied, and thus saved, in monastic scriptoriums. When Europe passed into the Dark Ages, Byzantine scriptoriums laboriously preserved Greco-Roman classics. As a result, Byzantium revived Classical models of education and libraries. The Imperial Library of Constantinople was an important depository of ancient knowledge. Constantine himself wanted such a library but his short rule denied him the ability to see his vision to fruition. His son Constantius II made this dream a reality and created an imperial library in a portico of the royal palace. He ruled for 24 years and accelerated the development of the library and the intellectual culture that came with such a vast accumulation of books.Staikos, 2007, pp. 30‚Äì31 Constantius II appointed Themistius, a pagan philosopher and teacher, as chief architect of this library building program. Themistius set about a bold program to create an imperial public library that would be the centerpiece of the new intellectual capital of Constantinople.Staikos, 2007, p. 33 Classical authors such as Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, Isocrates, Thucydides, Homer, and Zeno were sought. Themeistius hired calligraphers and craftsman to produce the actual codices. He also appointed educators and created a university-like school centered around the library.Staikos, 2007, pp. 32‚Äì33 After the death of Constantius II, Julian the Apostate, a bibliophile intellectual, ruled briefly for less than three years. Despite this, he had a profound impact on the imperial library and sought both Christian and pagan books for its collections. Later, the Emperor Valens hired Greek and Latin scribes full-time with from the royal treasury to copy and repair manuscripts. At its height in the 5th century, the Imperial Library of Constantinople had 120,000 volumes and was the largest library in Europe. A fire in 477 consumed the entire library but it was rebuilt only to be burned again in 726, 1204, and in 1453 when Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks. p. 603. Patriarchal libraries fared no better, and sometimes worse, than the Imperial Library. The Library of the Patriarchate of Constantinople was founded most likely during the reign of Constantine the Great in the 4th century.Staikos, 2007, p. 43 As a theological library, it was known to have employed a library classification system.Staikos, 2007, p. 44 It also served as a repository of several ecumenical councils such as the Council of Nicea, Council of Ephesus, and the Council of Chalcedon. The library, which employed a librarian and assistants, may have been originally located in the Patriarch's official residence before it was moved to the Thomaites Triclinus in the 7th century. While much is not known about the actual library itself, it is known that many of its contents were subject to destruction as religious in-fighting ultimately resulted in book burnings.Staikos, 2007, pp. 44‚Äì45 During this period, small private libraries existed. Many of these were owned by church members and the aristocracy.Staikos, 2007, p. 429 Teachers also were known to have small personal libraries as well as wealthy bibliophiles who could afford the highly ornate books of the period. Thus, in the 6th century, at the close of the Classical period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria. Cassiodorus, minister to Theodoric, established a monastery at Vivarium in the toe of Italy (modern Calabria) with a library where he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus not only collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of reading and methods for copying texts accurately. In the end, however, the library at Vivarium was dispersed and lost within a century. Through Origen and especially the scholarly presbyter Pamphilus of Caesarea, an avid collector of books of Scripture, the theological school of Caesarea won a reputation for having the most extensive ecclesiastical library of the time, containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: Gregory Nazianzus, Basil the Great, Jerome and others came and studied there. Islamic lands Inside a Qur'anic library in Chinguetti, Mauritania The first libraries in Muslim lands were not necessarily for the public, but they contained much knowledge. The need for the preservation of the Quran, the Muslim holy book, and the Traditions of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, is what led to the collection of writings in the Muslim world. Where traditions and history used to be oral, the need to preserve the words of the Quran necessitated a method of preserving the words by some means other than orally. Mosques that were the center of everything in a Muslim society's day-to-day life became also libraries that stored and preserved all knowledge, from the Quran to books on religion, philosophy and science. \\"Under the Abbasids, Muslims formed the vanguard of civilization. The Abbasids were influenced by the Quran and Hadith such as, \\"the ink of scholar is equal to the blood of martyr,Wani, Z. A., & Maqbol, T. (2012). The Islamic Era and Its Importance to Knowledge and the Development of Libraries. Library Philosophy & Practice, p. 207. \\"stressing the value of knowledge.\\" With the passion of the Caliphs to establish centers of knowledge, the Muslim world quickly began to have different centers that housed libraries which contained encyclopedias, translations, commentaries and treatises written by Muslim philosophers, scholars and scientists. With the invention of paper, the Muslim world quickly began to progress in its development of libraries, and \\"libraries (royal, public, specialised, private) had become common and bookmen (authors, translators, copiers, illuminators, librarians, booksellers' collectors) from all classes and sections of society, of all nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, vied with each other in the production and distribution of books.\\"Wani, Z. A., & Maqbol, T. (2012). The Islamic Era and Its Importance to Knowledge and the Development of Libraries. Library Philosophy & Practice, p. 208. By the 8th century, first Iranians and then Arabs had imported the craft of papermaking from China, with a paper mill already at work in Baghdad in 794 then called Bagdatikos.Murray, S. (2009). The library: an illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Pub.; Chicago: ALA Editions, 2009. p. 57 By the 9th century, public libraries started to appear in many Islamic cities. They were called \\"halls of Science\\" or dar al-'ilm. They were each endowed by Islamic sects with the purpose of representing their tenets as well as promoting the dissemination of secular knowledge. In Baghdad, the library was known as the House of Wisdom. It also was a university where numerous scholars and copyists translated works from other nations into Arabic. The 9th-century Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil of Iraq, ordered the construction of a \\"zawiyat qurra\\" ‚Äì an enclosure for readers which was \\"lavishly furnished and equipped\\". In Shiraz Adhud al-Daula (d. 983) set up a library, described by the medieval historian, al-Muqaddasi, as \\"a complex of buildings surrounded by gardens with lakes and waterways. The buildings were topped with domes, and comprised an upper and a lower story with a total, according to the chief official, of 360 rooms.... In each department, catalogues were placed on a shelf... the rooms were furnished with carpets\\". The libraries often employed translators and copyists in large numbers, in order to render into Arabic the bulk of the available Persian, Greek, Roman and Sanskrit non-fiction and the classics of literature. From the art, Muslims developed papermaking into an industry. As a result of this technical enhancement, the books were more easily manufactured and they were more broadly accessible. Coincided with the encouragement of science and a breakthrough in the translation movement, public and private libraries started to boost all around Islamic lands. A series of outstanding libraries within the Islamic territories were founded and flourished alongside Islam spread. They were called House of Knowledge or Dar al-'ilm. At the time libraries were the place that books and manuscripts were collected, read, copied, reproduced and borrowed by students, masters and even ordinary people. In addition to remarkable standing-alone libraries, there were prevalent medium-sized book collections that were mainly located inside the schools or Madrasa throughout the major Islamic cities. Libraries‚Äô resources, based on their serving target groups and the founder's set of interests and the Islamic sect, entailed a broad range of subjects e.g. religion, science, astrology, geography, literature, history and linguistics. Throughout the Islamic era, not only private and academic libraries, but also public libraries became very popular. The patrons were not limited to elites, rather the resources were openly accessible to everyone. Some of the libraries were said to let patrons check out up to 200 items. The library designers noticed the comfort of readers and information seekers. The floor of reading rooms was covered by carpets. Also, openings such as doors and windows were secured closed as to protect patrons against cold drafts. The libraries often employed translators and copyists in large numbers, in order to render the books into Arabic from Persian, Greek, Roman and Sanskrit. Islamic states in Africa began to see a rapid development in education from the 11th century. Libraries of particular importance would include that of Timbuktu, which held many manuscripts that were important for over 600 years in the Ghanan, Mali and Songhai empires. One of the most notable authors was Ahmad Baba who wrote over 40 manuscripts ‚Äì widely considered as being one of the most influential scholars from Timbuktu. Many of the manuscripts and buildings were destroyed by the Arab-European invasion in 1591 and writers, such as Ahmad Baba were taken into captivity. Despite this and the poor preservation conditions as many as 700,000 manuscripts still survive today. This flowering of Islamic learning ceased centuries later when learning began declining in the Islamic world, after many of these libraries were destroyed by Mongol invasions. Others were victim of wars and religious strife in the Islamic world. However, a few examples of these medieval libraries, such as the libraries of Chinguetti in West Africa, remain intact and relatively unchanged. Another ancient library from this period which is still operational and expanding is the Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi in the Iranian city of Mashhad, which has been operating for more than six centuries. The contents of these Islamic libraries were copied by Christian monks in Muslim/Christian border areas, particularly Spain and Sicily. From there they eventually made their way into other parts of Christian Europe. These copies joined works that had been preserved directly by Christian monks from Greek and Roman originals, as well as copies Western Christian monks made of Byzantine works. The resulting conglomerate libraries are the basis of every modern library today. = Islam = Qur'an manuscript on display at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina The centrality of the Qur æƒÅn as the prototype of the written word in Islam bears significantly on the role of books within its intellectual tradition and educational system. An early impulse in Islam was to manage reports of events, key figures and their sayings and actions. Thus, \\"the onus of being the last 'People of the Book' engendered an ethos of [librarianship]\\" early on and the establishment of important book repositories throughout the Muslim world have occurred ever since. 13th century manuscript, drawn by Al-Wasiti of the celebrated book ‚ÄúThe Assemblies‚Äù. Written by Hariri, shows a library in Baghdad Upon the spread of Islam, libraries in newly Islamic lands (7th‚Äì14th century) had a strength organization and knew a brief period of expansion in the Middle East, North Africa, Sicily, and Spain. In this period, books were organized by subject. Within the subject, the materials were further organized by when the libraries gained the item, not by last name of the author or the title of the book. Also, Islamic libraries may be the first to have implemented a catalogue of owned materials. The content of a bookshelf was recorded on paper and attached to the end of shelf. Like the Christian libraries, they mostly contained books which were made of paper, and took a codex or modern form instead of scrolls; they could be found in mosques, private homes, and universities, from Timbuktu to Afghanistan and modern day Pakistan. In Aleppo, for example, the largest and probably the oldest mosque library, the Sufiya, located at the city's Grand Umayyad Mosque, contained a large book collection of which 10,000 volumes were reportedly bequeathed by the city's most famous ruler, Prince Sayf al-Dawla. Ibn al- Nadim's bibliography Fihrist demonstrates the devotion of medieval Muslim scholars to books and reliable sources; it contains a description of thousands of books circulating in the Islamic world circa 1000, including an entire section for books about the doctrines of other religions. Modern Islamic libraries for the most part do not hold these antique books; many were lost, destroyed by Mongols,Chief among the libraries destroyed by the Mongol hordes was that of the Shia Ismaili Muslim community who occupied a network of mountain fortresses ‚Äì lead from the castle of Alamut ‚Äì beginning from the end of the eleventh century to about 1256. \\"The Fatimids and their successors at Alamut were great lovers and patrons of books, and their vast libraries attracted scholars of every creed from far and wide. The Imam al-Hakim even provided ink, pens, paper, and inkstands free of charge for all who sought learning in the 'House of Knowledge' (dƒÅr al- øilm). We can only imagine the horror the Ismailis would have felt when they witnessed the destruction of the literary legacy they had so painstakingly fostered. Al-Maqrizi (d. 845/1442) describes how great hills of ashes were formed when the slaves and maids of the Luwata Berber tribe burned the Fatimid books. As an act of further desecration, they used the precious bindings of the volumes to make sandals for their feet. Similarly, Juwayni exults at torching the Ismaili library of Alamut, \\"the fame of which\\", he adds, \\"had spread throughout the world\\". See, or removed to European libraries and museums during the colonial period. = Libraries throughout the Islamic lands = Some renowned libraries throughout the Islamic lands: * The 9th-century Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil of Iraq, ordered the construction of a \\"zawiyat qurra\\" ‚Äì an enclosure for readers which was \\"lavishly furnished and equipped\\". * Yahya ibn Abi Mansur (Ibn Munajem) Library- 9th century- As a Khalifah's Chief Astrologer, he was the owner of a luxurious palace containing a tremendous library with numerous books in different sets of disciplines and science, in particular, astrology. This library was called ‚ÄúTreasury of Wisdom‚Äù or ‚ÄúKhazanah Al-Hekmah‚Äù. * Nuh Ibn Mansour Samani Library- Bukhara-10th century: Samanid Empire rulers were famous for showing a considerable passion for culture and science and their consistent support for promoting libraries. Nuh II had a sizable library. Avicenna who was one of the visitors to Mansour's library in Bukhara has described it as extraordinary in terms of the number of volumes and the value of books. Looking for a certain item in medicine, he requested an entry permit from the Sultan to browse the library storage space. The book stack had been composed of plenty of rooms, each room had contained numerous boxes and each box had been filled with stacks of books as he reported. * Baha al-Dowleh and Azod al-Dowleh Daylami Library-Shiraz- 10th century: These regional rulers from Iranian Daylamites Dynasty were owners of one of the most prominent libraries within the Islamic lands. As stated by al-Muqaddasi, a reputable Islamic historian and geographer, a copy of each and every book he had ever seen during his life and travels, all were presented in Azod al-Dowleh library. al-Muqaddasi described the library as a complex of buildings surrounded by gardens with lakes and waterways. The buildings were topped with domes, and comprised an upper and a lower storey with a total, according to the chief official, of 360 rooms.... In each department, catalogues were placed on a shelf... the rooms were furnished with carpets. * The Library of Abu-Nasr Shapur Ibn Ardeshir- Baghdad- 10th century: Abu-Nasr who was a Daylamites‚Äô Minister, founded a mega well-known public library in Baghdad that is claimed to hold 10 thousand volumes. The library was destroyed during Baghdad's big fire. * Sahib ibn Abbad Library-Rey- 10th century- The Iranian Grand Vizier to Buyid rulers established a legendary public library holding around 200,000 volumes. Ibn Abbad who was so proud of this great collection of books once refused the invitation of Samanid rulers to become their Grand Vizier in Bukhara, giving the excuse of attachment to his books that would need around 400 camels to carry on. The library was partially destroyed in 1029 by the troops of the Ghaznavids. As evidence to a large amount of the resources, some scholars claimed that just the library catalogue was equal to 10 volumes. * Greater Merv or Merv Shahijan set of libraries: Yaqut al-Hamawi, a renowned Moslem bibliographer and geographer, on a way to his continual travels, stopped by Merv and settled there for a while to make the best use of sets of impressive libraries to complement his research studies. He named ten distinct exceptional libraries some are stated to hold more than 12,000 books. Some of Merv's libraries resources were highly unique and precious not to be found anywhere else, as he stated. Patrons could easily check out a large number of items from these book collections. As Hamawi reported he was allowed to keep more than 200 books on a long period loan. Most of these valuable libraries were burnt and ruined by the Mughals. * Rab'-e Rashidi Library- Maragheh-13th century: Rashid al-Din Hamadani, the Iranian author of Universal History and the Grand Vizier of Sultan Ghazan, was a talented founder of charitable Rab'-e Rashidi Complex and Library. He has elaborated the conditions of using the library resources in a remaining valuable Deed for Endowment (Vaghfnameh) which is of great importance in regards to the applied administrative procedures for running the libraries during the Islamic period: ‚ÄúThis public library (Dar al-Masahef) shall deliver service to researchers for the purpose of studying and copying the resources. Books are allowed to be used within the library. Taking out the library books requires some refundable deposit equates to the half value of the borrowed item. The loan period is not allowed to exceed one month. The borrowed item shall get stamped by the librarian in order to be recognized as the property of the library‚Äù. The original Deed manuscript, being kept in National Museum of Tabriz, is now a registered UNESCO World Heritage document They were many other sizable libraries in major Islamic cities, e.g. Basrah, Damascus, Isfahan, Toos, Baghdad, Shoush, Mousel and Shiraz. Asia The spread of religion and philosophy in South and East Asia spurred the development of writing and books. Chinese emperors were very supportive of this culture. Chinese printing and paper making, which predate Western development, gave birth to a thriving book culture in East Asia. Several Asian religious and philosophical movements are responsible for stimulating learning, printing and book collecting: Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and Jainism. Jainism, a major faith of the Indian subcontinent, had a tradition of religious, scientific, and cultural scholarship. Early practitioners of the faith not only produced scriptural writing the first century BC, but also established some of Asia's earliest libraries. Mainly housed in temples, these libraries later became known as \\"Jain Knowledge Warehouses\\" and is responsible for the preservation of hundreds of thousands handwritten manuscripts. The invention of paper in China allowed the Chinese to create an early form of printing (stone-rubbing). Writings the sixth-century philosopher, Confucius, were originally inscribed on stone tablets. To achieve this early form of printing the Chinese would push soft paper onto the stone, apply ink to the back of the sheet, resulting in a black background with white letters. The Chinese also employed inked carved woodblock to produce printed materials. One of the major Buddhist canons, the Tripitaka, was published in 5,000 volumes using more than 130,000 individual woodblocks. In the eleventh century movable type was developed in China and Koreans established the first foundry for producing movable type. In spite of these developments, woodblock printing remained the norm in China, Korea, and Japan. Each ruler in China compiled its own official written archives. Every emperor decided which philosophical texts, which accounts of history, which rituals of faith, and what poetry and literature would be permitted in the empire; oftentimes chronicling their own version of the previous ruler's history. Confucian and Buddhist writings that were brought to Korea and Japan are directly responsible for the continued development of book publishing and library building in East Asia. Buddhist scriptures, educational materials, and histories were stored in libraries in pre-modern Southeast Asia. In Burma, a royal library called the Pitakataik was legendarily founded by King Anawrahta;International dictionary of library histories, 29 in the 18th century, British envoy Michael Symes, on visiting this library, wrote that \\"it is not improbable that his Birman majesty may possess a more numerous library than any potentate, from the banks of the Danube to the borders of China\\". In Thailand libraries called ho trai were built throughout the country, usually on stilts above a pond to prevent bugs from eating at the books. European Middle Ages Science library of Upper Lusatia in G√∂rlitz, Germany Merton College Library In the Early Middle Ages, monastery libraries developed, such as the important one at the Abbey of Montecassino in Italy. Books were usually chained to the shelves, reflecting the fact that manuscripts, which were created via the labour-intensive process of hand copying, were valuable possessions. This hand-copying was often accomplished by travelling monks who made the treks to the sources of knowledge and illumination they sought for learning or to copy the manuscripts held by other monasteries for their own monastic libraries. Despite this protectiveness, many libraries loaned books if provided with security deposits (usually money or a book of equal value). Lending was a means by which books could be copied and spread. In 1212 the council of Paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them that lending is \\"one of the chief works of mercy.\\" The early libraries located in monastic cloisters and associated with scriptoria were collections of lecterns with books chained to them. Shelves built above and between back-to-back lecterns were the beginning of bookpresses. The chain was attached at the fore-edge of a book rather than to its spine. Book presses came to be arranged in carrels (perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows) in order to maximize lighting, with low bookcases in front of the windows. This \\"stall system\\" (i.e. fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by closely spaced windows) was characteristic of English institutional libraries. In European libraries, bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the walls. This \\"wall system\\" was first introduced on a large scale in Spain's El Escorial. As extensions of the Catholic Church, medieval libraries' collections often excluded materials considered to be heretical or \\"pagan\\", such as the works of Plato and Aristotle.Beddie, J. (1930). The Ancient Classics in the Mediaeval Libraries. Speculum, 5(1), 3-20. doi:10.2307/2846353 Also, in Eastern Christianity monastery libraries kept important manuscripts. The most important of them were the ones in the monasteries of Mount Athos for Orthodox Christians, and the library of the Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt for the Coptic Church. Renaissance Reading room of the Laurentian Library From the 15th century in central and northern Italy, libraries of humanists and their enlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an \\"academy\\" of scholars congregated in each Italian city of consequence. Malatesta Novello, lord of Cesena, founded the Malatestiana Library. Cosimo de Medici in Florence established his own collection, which formed the basis of the Laurentian Library.Survivor: the History of the Library, history-magazine.com In Rome, the papal collections were brought together by Pope Nicholas V, in separate Greek and Latin libraries, and housed by Pope Sixtus IV, who consigned the Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana to the care of his librarian, the humanist Bartolomeo Platina in February 1475.This section on Roman Renaissance libraries follows Kenneth M. Setton, \\"From Medieval to Modern Library\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 104.4, Dedication of the APS Library Hall, Autumn General Meeting, November 1959 (August 1960:371‚Äì390) p. 372 ff. The Hungarian Bibliotheca Corviniana was one of the first and largest Renaissance Greek-Latin libraries, established by Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary between 1458 and 1490. In 1490, the library consisted of about 3,000 codices or \\"Corvinae\\". Beatrix of Aragon, Queen of Hungary, encouraged his work with the Bibliotheca Corviniana. After Matthias' death in 1490 many of the manuscripts were taken from library and dispersed, subsequently the Turkish invasion of Hungary in the 16th century saw the remaining valuable manuscripts taken to Turkey. In the 16th century Sixtus V bisected Bramante's Cortile del Belvedere with a cross-wing to house the Apostolic Library in suitable magnificence. The 16th and 17th centuries saw other privately endowed libraries assembled in Rome: the Vallicelliana, formed from the books of Saint Filippo Neri, with other distinguished libraries such as that of Cesare Baronio, the Biblioteca Angelica founded by the Augustinian Angelo Rocca, which was the only truly public library in Counter-Reformation Rome; the Biblioteca Alessandrina with which Pope Alexander VII endowed the University of Rome; the Biblioteca Casanatense of the Cardinal Girolamo Casanate; and finally the Biblioteca Corsiniana founded by the bibliophile Clement XII Corsini and his nephew Cardinal Neri Corsini, still housed in Palazzo Corsini in via della Lungara. The Republic of Venice patronized the foundation of the Biblioteca Marciana, based on the library of Cardinal Basilios Bessarion. In Milan Cardinal Federico Borromeo founded the Biblioteca Ambrosiana. This trend soon spread outside of Italy, for example Louis III, Elector Palatine founded the Bibliotheca Palatina of Heidelberg. These libraries had fewer volumes than modern libraries; but they had many valuable manuscripts of Greek, Latin and Biblical works. After the invention of the printing press, many Renaissance libraries began to collect printed texts of useful information as well as historical manuscripts; this change occurred between about 1550 and 1650. This transition of collections during the Renaissance was not just a shift from manuscripts to printed texts, but also from books as expensive luxury aesthetic artifacts both in print and in manuscript form to an expenditure on multiple copies of printed texts which held valuable, practical information. p. 211. One example is the library at the Ducal Palace in Urbino, Italy. For instance the Ducal Palace library of Urbino contains an older library with texts which mainly served to record the history of the Duke of Urbino's family and show his magnificence, and a newer library which was an information retrieval system for research and discussion by contemporary scholars. The ducal library also housed what we would consider as archival materials, such as Renaissance newsletter manuscripts, and diplomatic, engineering, military, and other political and moral documents. Tianyi Chamber, founded in 1561 by Fan Qin during the Ming Dynasty, is the oldest existing library in China. In its heyday it boasted a collection of 70,000 volumes of antique books. Enlightenment era libraries Thomas Bodley founded the Bodleian Library in 1602 as an early public library. The 17th and 18th centuries include what is known as a golden age of libraries; during this some of the more important libraries were founded in Europe. Francis Trigge Chained Library of St. Wulfram's Church, Grantham, Lincolnshire was founded in 1598 by the rector of nearby Welbourne. This library is considered the \\"ancestor of public libraries\\" because patrons were not required to be members of a particular college or church to use the library. Trigge's library held over 350 books, and his inclusion of both Catholic and Protestant resources is considered unique for the time, since religious conflicts during the Reformation years were common. Thomas Bodley founded the Bodleian Library, which was open to the \\"whole republic of the learned\\", Norwich City library was established in 1608 and the British Library was established in 1753. Chetham's Library in Manchester, which claims to be the oldest public library in the English- speaking world, opened in 1653. Other early town libraries of the UK include those of Ipswich (1612), Bristol (founded in 1613 and opened in 1615), and Leicester (1632). Shrewsbury School also opened its library to townsfolk.Hobson, Anthony \\"Open Shelves\\", TLS, 8 December 2006, 9. The Biblioth√®que Mazarine was initially the personal library of cardinal Mazarin (1602‚Äì1661), who was a great bibliophile. His first library, arranged by his librarian, Gabriel Naud√©, was dispersed when he had to flee Paris during the Fronde. He then began a second library with what was left of the first, assisted by the successor to Naud√©, Fran√ßois de La Poterie. At his death he bequeathed his library, which he had opened to scholars since 1643, to the Coll√®ge des Quatre-Nations which he had founded in 1661. The Biblioth√®que Sainte-Genevi√®ve was also founded in Paris, the Austrian National Library in Vienna, the National Central Library in Florence, the Prussian State Library in Berlin, the Za≈Çuski Library in Warsaw and the M.E. Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library in St Petersburg. But this golden age was not just some prosaic period of great expansion to the number and accessibility of the libraries of Europe; it was also a period of great conflict. The Reformation did not just inspire a redistribution of power but also a redistribution of wealth and knowledge. While the Thirty Years War (1618‚Äì1648) decimated the population of Europe (from 21 million at the beginning of the conflict to 13 million by the end) it also aided in the redistribution of this wealth and knowledge. Often the plunder of this conflict included the recovery of books from looted monasteries and libraries. Given the large cost associated with the creation of the codex it should come as little surprise that books would be seen as a prize of both pecuniary and scholastic wealth, enough that a Bavarian noble named Maximilian I Duke of Bavaria sent the captured contents of the Palatine Library of Heidelberg to the Vatican as a trophy to the Pope Gregory XV.Littell, Robert S., Eliakim Littell, and Making of America Project. Living Age, The. New York, The Living Age Co. Inc., V.121 Apr-Jun 1874. pp. 269 On the other side of the conflict, King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden specifically targeted Jesuit schools and seminaries and had wagon loads of loot (seized books and manuscripts) returned to the libraries of his home. Large volumes of books changed hands during the Thirty Years War and eventually found their way across Europe where new libraries sprang up to house these redistributed treasures. In addition to stores of knowledge being shuffled around as spoils of war, the printing press created economies of scale that allowed for the exchange of books to become more commonplace. Book fairs were the most merchants most common choice of sale and catalogs were their most common choice of organization. The collectors of this period helped shape the 'form' of libraries. We can see echoes of many of their innovations in the tropes of today's libraries. As noted previously, influenced by the ideals of Gabriel Naude, Cardinal Jules Mazarin proclaimed his library \\"open to everybody without exception\\". Also, possibly inspiring a trope, Sir Robert Bruce Cotton organized his library with the placement of busts of ancient Romans at the tops of his shelves, and cataloged his contents alphanumerically based on the name of the shelf (bust) and the book's physical position on the shelf (by number of books preceding it). At the start of the 18th century, libraries were becoming increasingly public and were more frequently lending libraries. The 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial libraries to lending libraries. Before this time, public libraries were parochial in nature and libraries frequently chained their books to desks. Libraries also were not uniformly open to the public.Predeek, Albert (1947) A History of Libraries in Great Britain and North America. Chicago: American Library Association; p. 58 The British Museum was established in 1751 and had a library containing over 50,000 books. Biblioteca Palafoxiana in Puebla City, Mexico, is recognized by the UNESCO for being the first public library in the Americas. Founded in 1646 by Juan de Palafox y Mendoza Even though the British Museum existed at this time and contained over 50,000 books, the national library was not open to the public, or even to a majority of the population. Access to the Museum depended on passes, of which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks. Moreover, the library was not open to browsing. Once a pass to the library had been issued, the reader was taken on a tour of it. Many readers complained that the tour was much too short.Battles, Matthew (2003) Library: an unquiet history; p. 121 Although most libraries followed this model of patron restriction, there were exceptions such as the Ducal Library at Wolfenb√ºttel, which was open every weekday morning and afternoon. The library had a diverse set of patrons of whom a large percentage were middle-class and non-academic users. Between 1714 and 1799, the library loaned 31,485 books, mostly fiction, to 1,648 patrons. =Subscription libraries= At the start of the 19th century, there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term i.e. libraries provided from public funds and freely accessible to all. Only one important library in Britain, namely Chetham's Library in Manchester, was fully and freely accessible to the public. However, there had come into being a whole network of library provision on a private or institutional basis. The increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the spread of lending libraries, especially the commercial subscription libraries. Many small, private book clubs evolved into subscription libraries, charging high annual fees or requiring subscribing members to purchase shares in the libraries. The materials available to subscribers tended to focus on particular subject areas, such as biography, history, philosophy, theology, and travel, rather than works of fiction, particularly the novel. Unlike a public library, access was often restricted to members. Some of the earliest such institutions were founded in late 17th-century England, such as Chetham's Library in 1653, Innerpeffray Library in 1680 and Thomas Plume's Library in 1704. In the American colonies, the Library Company of Philadelphia was started in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia, PA.Murray, S.A.P. (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York, NY: Skyhorse Publishing. Franklin's Junto and subscription library gained popularity across the colonies and, \\"by the 1750s, a dozen more subscription libraries had appeared, established in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and Maine.\\" Parochial libraries attached to Anglican parishes or Nonconformist chapels in Britain emerged in the early 18th century, and prepared the way for local public libraries.George Clark, The Later Stuarts: 1616‚Äì1714 (2nd ed. 1956) p 158. The increasing production and demand for fiction promoted by commercial markets led to the rise of circulating libraries, which met a need that subscription libraries did not fulfil. William Bathoe claimed that his commercial venture was 'the Original Circulating library', opening doors at two locations in London in 1737.Raven, James. \\"Libraries for sociability: the advance of subscription library.\\" The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 251. Circulating libraries also charged subscription fees to users and offered serious subject matter as well as the popular novels, thus the difficulty in clearly distinguishing circulating from subscription libraries.Eliot, Simon. \\"Circulating libraries in the Victorian age and after.\\" The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 125-126. Subscription libraries were democratic in nature; created by and for communities of local subscribers who aimed to establish permanent collections of books and reading materials, rather than selling their collections annually as the circulating libraries tended to do, in order to raise funds to support their other commercial interests. Even though the subscription libraries were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials.Forster, Geoffrey, and Alan Bell. \\"The subscription libraries and their members.\\" The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 147-148. In Britain there were more than 200 commercial circulating libraries open in 1800, more than twice the number of subscription and private proprietary libraries that were operating at the same time. Many proprietors pandered to the most fashionable clientele, making much ado about the sort of shop they offered, the lush interiors, plenty of room and long hours of service. \\"These 'libraries' would be called rental collections today.\\" =Private libraries= The Linen Hall Library was an 18th-century subscription library. Pictured in 1888, shortly before its demolition. Private subscription libraries functioned much like commercial subscription libraries, with some variations. One of the most popular versions of the private subscription library was the gentlemen only library. Membership was restricted to the proprietors or shareholders, and ranged from a dozen or two to between four and five hundred. The Liverpool Subscription library was a gentlemen only library. In 1798, it was renamed the Athenaeum when it was rebuilt with a newsroom and coffeehouse. It had an entrance fee of one guinea and an annual subscription of five shillings. An analysis of the registers for the first twelve years provides glimpses of middle-class reading habits in a mercantile community at this period. The largest and most popular sections of the library were history, antiquities, and geography, with 283 titles and 6,121 borrowings, and belles-lettres, with 238 titles and 3,313 borrowings.Kaufman, Paul. Libraries and Their Users. Page 29. The Library Association. 1969. Print. Circulating library and stationery shop, Gulgong, Australia 1870 Private subscription libraries held a greater amount of control over both membership and the types of books in the library. Cheap fiction was virtually absent.Kaufman, Paul (1969); p. 209 Subscription libraries prided themselves on respectability. The highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors, gentry, and the old professions.Allan, David (2008); p. 68 Towards the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the 19th century the need for books and general education made itself felt among social classes created by the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution.Irwin, Raymond (1964); p. 53 The late 18th century saw a rise in subscription libraries intended for the use of tradesmen. In 1797, there was established at Kendal the Economical Library, \\"designed principally for the use and instruction of the working classes\\". There was also the Artizans' library established at Birmingham in 1799. The entrance fee was 3 shillings. The subscription was 1 shilling 6 pence per quarter. This was a library of general literature. Novels, at first excluded, were afterwards admitted on condition that they did not account for more than one-tenth of the annual income. Benjamin Franklin led the founding of the first American subscription library. In Philadelphia, Franklin formed \\"a club of mutual improvements\\" calling themselves the \\"Junto\\", which meant a council or a combination of individuals organized for a specific purpose. Because the men in this club had a steady income, they could afford to be a part of this club and to purchase books. Only some had enough to be considered a library; together they shared what they all had. National libraries =Origins= The Lindisfarne Gospels is but one of the treasures collected by Sir Robert Cotton. The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state. This era is termed the \\"golden age of libraries\\", with millions of printed books available and widespread interest growing in both national and classical literature. National libraries would eventually become objects of pride in that same spirit, most Europeans considered themselves as belonging to a nation first and a religion second. Wars of religion would give way to wars of nationalism, as fierce and widespread as ever. This would become a major turning point for many libraries and their collections. One of the first plans for a national library was devised by the Welsh mathematician John Dee, who in 1556 presented Mary I of England with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, but his proposal was not taken up.Fell-Smith, Charlotte (1909) John Dee: 1527‚Äì1608. London: Constable and Company. In England, Sir Richard Bentley's Proposal for Building a Royal Library published in 1694 stimulated renewed interest in the subject. Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington, a wealthy antiquarian, amassed the richest private collection of manuscripts in the world at the time and founded the Cotton Library. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, many priceless and ancient manuscripts that had belonged to the monastic libraries began to be disseminated among various owners, many of whom were unaware of the cultural value of the manuscripts. Sir Robert's genius was in finding, purchasing and preserving these ancient documents.John Aikin. The Lives of John Selden, Esq., and Archbishop Usher; With Notices of the Principal English Men of Letters with Whom They Were Connected. 1812. p. 375. After his death his grandson donated the library to the nation as its first national library. This transfer established the formation of the British Library.http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/manuscripts/cottonmss/cottonmss.html\\"An Act for the better settling and preserving the Library kept in the House at Westminster called Cotton House in the Name and Family of the Cottons for the Benefit of the Publick\\" [Chapter VII. Rot. Parl. 12 ¬ß 13 Gul. III. p. 1. n. 7.], Statutes of the Realm: volume 7: 1695‚Äì1701 (1820), pp. 642‚Äì643. =National libraries= Sir Hans Sloane's collection of books and manuscripts was bequeathed to the British Museum. The first true national library was founded in 1753 as part of the British Museum. This new institution was the first of a new kind of museum ‚Äì national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything. The museum's foundations lay in the will of the physician and naturalist Sir Hans Sloane, who gathered an enviable collection of curiosities over his lifetime which he bequeathed to the nation for ¬£20,000. Sloane's collection included some 40,000 printed books and 7,000 manuscripts, as well as prints and drawings. The British Museum Act 1753 also incorporated the Cotton library and the Harleian library. These were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various British monarchs.Letter to Charles Long (1823), BMCE115/3,10. Scrapbooks and illustrations of the Museum. (Wilson, David, M.) (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 346 The first exhibition galleries and reading room for scholars opened on 15 January 1759,The British Museum Opened, History Today and in 1757, King George II granted it the right to a copy of every book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the Museum's library would expand indefinitely. Anthony Panizzi became the Principal Librarian at the British Library in 1856, where he oversaw its modernization. During his tenure, the Library's holdings increased from 235,000 to 540,000 volumes, making it the largest library in the world at the time. Its famous circular Reading Room was opened in 1857. Panizzi undertook the creation of a new catalogue, based on the \\"Ninety-One Cataloguing Rules\\" (1841) which he devised with his assistants. These rules served as the basis for all subsequent catalogue rules of the 19th and 20th centuries, and are at the origins of the ISBD and of digital cataloguing elements such as Dublin Core. As librarian of the Biblioth√®que Mazarine, Jacques Auguste de Thou transformed it into the largest library in the world at the time. In France, the first national library was the Biblioth√®que Mazarine, which evolved from its origin as a royal library founded at the Louvre Palace by Charles V in 1368. At the death of Charles VI, this first collection was unilaterally bought by the English regent of France, the Duke of Bedford, who transferred it to England in 1424. It was apparently dispersed at his death in 1435. The invention of printing resulted in the starting of another collection in the Louvre inherited by Louis XI in 1461. Francis I transferred the collection in 1534 to Fontainebleau and merged it with his private library. The appointment of Jacques Auguste de Thou as librarian in the 17th century initiated a period of development that made it the largest and richest collection of books in the world. The library opened to the public in 1692, under the administration of Abb√© Louvois, Minister Louvois's son. Abb√© Louvois was succeeded by the Abb√© Bignon, or Bignon II as he was termed, who instituted a complete reform of the library's system. Catalogues were made which appeared from 1739 to 1753 in 11 volumes. The collections increased steadily by purchase and gift to the outbreak of the French Revolution, at which time it was in grave danger of partial or total destruction, but owing to the activities of Antoine-Augustin Renouard and Joseph Van Praet it suffered no injury. The library's collections swelled to over 300,000 volumes during the radical phase of the French Revolution when the private libraries of aristocrats and clergy were seized. After the establishment of the French First Republic in September 1792, \\"the Assembly declared the Bibliotheque du Roi to be national property and the institution was renamed the Biblioth√®que Nationale. After four centuries of control by the Crown, this great library now became the property of the French people.\\" Expansion In the newly formed United States, James Madison first proposed instituting a congressional library in 1783.Murray, Stuart. The Library: An Illustrated History (New York, Skyhouse Publishing, 2012): 155. The Library of Congress was established on 24 April 1800, when president John Adams signed an act of Congress providing for the transfer of the seat of government from Philadelphia to the new capital city of Washington. Part of the legislation appropriated $5,000 \\"for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress ..., and for fitting up a suitable apartment for containing them....\\" Books were ordered from London and the collection, consisting of 740 books and 3 maps, was housed in the new Capitol. The Za≈Çuski Library of Poland was taken by Russia after the country's partition, and the collection formed the nucleus of the Russian Imperial Public Library, established in 1795. The Imperial Public Library of Russia was established in 1795 by Catherine the Great, whose private collections included the domestic libraries of Voltaire and Diderot, which she had purchased from their heirs. Voltaire's personal library is still one of the highlights of the collection. The plan of a Russian public library was submitted to Catherine in 1766 but the Empress did not approve the project for the imperial library until , eighteen months before her death. The cornerstone of the foreign-language department came from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the form of Za≈Çuski's Library (420,000 volumes), nationalized by the Russian government at the time of the partitions.–ú–∞–ª—ã–π —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å –ë—Ä–æ–∫–≥–∞—É–∑–∞ –∏ –ï—Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞, published in the Imperial Russia in the early 1900s The Polish-language books from the library (numbering some 55,000 titles) were returned to Poland by the Russian SFSR in 1921.Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd. edition Although Germany was only united as a state in 1871, the first national library was set up in the context of the German revolutions of 1848. Various booksellers and publishers offered their works to the Frankfurt Parliament for a parliamentary library. The library, led by Johann Heinrich Plath, was termed the Reichsbibliothek (\\"Reich library\\"). After the failure of the revolution the library was abandoned and the stock of books already in existence was stored at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg. In 1912, the town of Leipzig, seat of the annual Leipzig Book Fair, the Kingdom of Saxony and the B√∂rsenverein der Deutschen Buchh√§ndler (Association of German booksellers) agreed to found a German National Library in Leipzig. Starting 1 January 1913, all publications in German were systematically collected (including books from Austria and Switzerland). Modern public libraries =United Kingdom= James Silk Buckingham led the campaign for public libraries in the mid-19th century. Although by the mid-19th century England could claim 274 subscription libraries and Scotland, 266, the foundation of the modern public library system in Britain is the Public Libraries Act 1850. The Act first gave local boroughs the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the Chartist movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The Capitalist economic model had created a significant amount of free time for workers, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders.McMenemy (2009), pp. 24‚Äì26 Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good. In 1835, and against government opposition, James Silk Buckingham, MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the temperance movement, was able to secure the Chair of the Select Committee which would examine \\"the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom\\" and propose solutions. Francis Place, a campaigner for the working class, agreed that \\"the establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford\\".Select Committee on inquiry into drunkenness, Report (1834) Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on William Ewart MP and Joseph Brotherton MP, who introduced a bill which would \\"[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a ¬Ωd for the establishment of museums\\".Kelly & Kelly (1977), p. 77 This became the Museums Act 1845. The turn of the 20th century witnessed a tremendous expansion in the provision of public libraries in the English- speaking world. Pictured, the Peter White Public Library, built in 1905. The advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.Minto (1932) chapters 3‚Äì4Murison (1971) chapter 2Hansard (1850) Col. 848 The Bill passed through Parliament as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower crime rates. The earliest example in England of a library to be endowed for the benefit of users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was the Francis Trigge Chained Library in Grantham, Lincolnshire, established in 1598. The library still exists and can justifiably claim to be the forerunner of later public library systems. The beginning of the modern, free, open access libraries really got its start in the UK in 1847. Parliament appointed a committee, led by William Ewart, on Public Libraries to consider the necessity of establishing libraries through the nation: In 1849 their report noted the poor condition of library service, it recommended the establishment of free public libraries all over the country, and it led to the Public Libraries Act in 1850, which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10,000 to levy taxes for the support of public libraries. Salford Museum and Art Gallery first opened in November 1850 as \\"The Royal Museum & Public Library\\", as the first unconditionally free public library in England. Retrieved on 5 September 2008 The library in Campfield, Manchester was the first library to operate a free lending library without subscription in 1852. Norwich lays claims to being the first municipality to adopt the Public Libraries Act 1850 (which allowed any municipal borough with a population of 100,000 or more to introduce a halfpenny rate to establish public libraries ‚Äì although not to buy books). Norwich was the eleventh library to open, in 1857, after Winchester, Manchester, Liverpool, Bolton, Kidderminster, Cambridge, Birkenhead and Sheffield. Another important act was the Education Act 1870, which increased literacy and thereby the demand for libraries. By 1877, more than 75 cities had established free libraries, and by 1900 the number had reached 300. This finally marks the start of the public library as we know it. And these acts influenced similar laws in other countries, such as the US. =United States= The first tax-supported public library in the United States was Peterborough, New Hampshire (1833). It was first funded by a Town Meeting supported by state funds from the State Literary Fund, which was originally collected from taxes for the State University, but it wasn‚Äôt adequate enough to fund the university, so the money was reallocated for the library then later by an \\"Act Providing for the Establishment of Public Libraries\\" in 1849. The Peterborough Town Library was proposed by Reverend Abiel Abbot as a central collection of books that would be owned by the people and be free to all of the town's inhabitants.History: Peterborough Town Library The original collection was bought by Reverend Abbot and the library trustees and was housed in Smith & Thompson's general store, which also acted as a post office. The New Hampshire State Legislature was encouraged by the innovation of Abbot and in 1849 became ‚Äúthe first state to pass a law authorizing towns to raise money to establish and maintain their own libraries‚Äù. By 1890 the library had outgrown its space and a new building was constructed. This building has been expanded twice since then to accommodate the growing collection. According to the Peterborough Town Library website, ‚Äúits importance rests in its being created on the principle, accepted at Town Meeting, that the public library, like the public school, was deserving of maintenance by public taxation and should be owned and managed by the people of the community‚Äù. Andrew Carnegie played an important role in financing public libraries across the English- speaking world. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recognizes libraries as an invaluable community service and has added libraries to the list of essential services eligible for emergency funding after a disaster. With this funding, libraries can restore services faster in order to provide internet access, air conditioned spaces, electricity for charging electronic devices, and access to running water. The American School Library (1839) was an early frontier traveling library in the United States. The year 1876 is key in the history of librarianship in the United States. The American Library Association was formed on October 6, The American Library Journal was founded, Melvil Dewey published his decimal-based system of classification, and the United States Bureau of Education published its report, \\"Public libraries in the United States of America; their history, condition, and management.\\" During the post-Civil War years, there was a rise in the establishment of public libraries, a movement led chiefly by newly formed women's clubs. They contributed their own collections of books, conducted lengthy fund raising campaigns for buildings, and lobbied within their communities for financial support for libraries, as well as with legislatures and the Carnegie Library Endowment founded in the 20th century.Paula D. Watson, \\"Founding Mothers: The Contribution of Woman's Organizations to Public Library Development in the United States\\", Library Quarterly, Vol. 64, Issue 3, 1994, p. 236 They led the establishment of 75‚Äì80 percent of the libraries in communities across the country.Teva Scheer, \\"The 'Praxis' Side of the Equation: Club Women and American Public Administration\\", Administrative Theory & Praxis, Vol. 24, Issue 3, 2002, p. 525 Philanthropists and businessmen, including John Passmore Edwards, Henry Tate and Andrew Carnegie, helped to increase the number of public libraries from the late 19th century. Carnegie, who made his fortune largely in steel production and construction, devoted a great deal of his fortune to philanthropy. Carnegie alone built over 2000 libraries in the US, 660 Carnegie Libraries in Britain, in addition to many more in the Commonwealth. Carnegie also funded academic libraries, favoring small schools and schools with African American students. \\"In 1899, Pennsylvania State College became the first college to receive Carnegie funding ($150,000) and their library was constructed in 1903.\\" By the end of this life, he had given away $300 million, or 90 percent of his wealth. Carnegie listed universities, libraries, medical centers, public parks, meeting and concert halls, public baths, and churches as seven areas of particular importance for philanthropic endeavors. Carnegie did not assume full responsibility for the construction of new libraries and library branches; rather, he stipulated that communities provide sites for libraries, and governments commit to providing salaries for staff and maintaining the libraries. Additionally, Carnegie libraries could not rely solely on private funds, but required public funds as well. This ensured that the libraries would be a part of the community and continue to receive funding after the initial donation. In total, Carnegie donated $40 million to the construction of 1,670 public library buildings in the United States. Additionally, Carnegie funded construction for more than 100 academic libraries in the United States. In 1997, Bill and Melinda Gates worked on their first major philanthropic venture call the U.S. Library Program. The program provided grants to \\"more than 5,800 libraries in the United States, installed more than 25,000 PCs and trained 7,000 librarians.\\" By providing grants the U.S. Library Program has \\"increased public access to computer, the Internet and digital information to library patrons in low-income communities\\". African American libraries and literary societies The history of African Americans and libraries in the United States is one with a rich heritage. The earliest established library started by and for African Americans in the US was the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons. By 1838, its collection included 600 volumes, as well as pamphlets and maps. Members could read independently or follow a scheduled course of study. The nineteenth century was a fruitful time for African American literary societies. As well as a creating space for a black literary tradition, these societies provided libraries to their members, often through subscriptions. They were an important beginning in library access for African Americans in the United States when they were excluded from larger white literary societies. African American literary societies included the Bethel Literary and Historical Society, Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons already mentioned. Additional societies that held an important role in library history included the Banneker Institute of the City of Philadelphia which began in 1854 and, within three years, had a library that compared to that of the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons, which in 1841 recorded a collection of almost 600 books. There were also literary societies created specifically by and for black women such as the Female Literary Association which started in Philadelphia in 1831 and included the role of a librarian in its constitution, who would ‚Äúhave charge of all books belonging to the Association, and after each meeting, take care that they be placed in the Library.‚Äù Much of the literature focuses on Philadelphia seemingly due to the many literary societies found there and the documentation that has been preserved about them, but there were many throughout the country. The Phoenix Society was one such society, which began in New York in 1833 with one of the founding goals being to ‚Äò‚Äòestablish circulating libraries . . . for the use of people of colour on very moderate pay‚Äù; within eight months of their inception‚Äîby December 1833‚Äîthey had succeeded in opening a library and reading room. The philanthropy of Andrew Carnegie had a tremendous impact upon the ability of \\"Colored Library Associations\\" being able to gain access to funding in order to build libraries in and for their communities. In the south, \\"African Americans living in such cities as Charlotte, North Carolina, and Houston even had access to black public libraries that had independent governance.\\" Wheeler, M., Johnson-Houston, D., & Walker, B.E. (2004). A Brief History of Library Service to African Americans. American Libraries, 35(2), 42 In Houston, a library was established inside a school in 1909, then later it was relocated to a new building in 1913 with the help of Carnegie Corporation Funds. Thanks to the support of Carnegie and his corporation, many cities were able to construct and maintain African American libraries. Dr. William E. B. Du Bois also attributed the movement for Negro libraries to the \\"natural desire (of the race) for books\\".Du Bois, W. E. (1909). 14th Annual Conference for the Study of the Negro Problems. Efforts for Social Betterment Among Negro Americans. Atlanta: Atlanta University Press Another funder for building libraries, especially in African American communities in the South, was the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The WPA was part of the ‚ÄúNew Deal‚Äù created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his administration. The ‚ÄúNew Deal‚Äù was meant to boost and invest in the American economy and infrastructure that was devastated by the Great Depression. Services and access to funds was to be distributed to all areas, but especially regions hit the hardest, such as the South. The South had been devastated by the Great Depression and racial divisions exacerbated the economic conditions. With nearly two-thirds of the population in the South being African Americans it was imperative that everyone have access to resources afforded through the WPA. In 1935, the WPA created the library demonstration project. The project was created to encourage the development of libraries in underserved areas and to boost employment. With the help of WPA, African Americans were afforded more access to libraries and employment. For instance, in 1933 South Carolina had fifty- six public libraries and only four provided services to the African American community. Even with private libraries filled with donations, only 15 percent of the African American community in South Carolina had access to library services and materials. By 1937,the WPA had established a bookmobile for the African American Community in South Carolina. By 1939, WPA funded twenty-nine segregated libraries, the majority of which employed members of the African American community. Though it is undetermined how many libraries were built to serve African American communities through the WPA, the WPA built and renovated at least 1,000 libraries. These numbers do not include the funding, services and assistance the program provided to existing libraries. \\\\---- =South Africa= Beginning in 1910, South Africa's public libraries grew in importance to the country's English settlers. During World War I, South Africa had a total of seventy-one subscription libraries, all governed by the English government. p. 39. Afrikaners had less libraries at the time, only seven. In 1928, two librarians were appointed by the Carnegie Corporation in New York to survey library resources in South Africa. Their top two concerns were the lack of library use by Afrikaners and creating library provisions and school library services for non-Whites, with the recommendation that they not share the same buildings as White patrons. During the apartheid years (1948‚Äì1994), progressive libraries such as the Durban Library, opened branches in Indian and Colored communities, despite government pressure to not do so. The years of apartheid began with the Natal Indian Congress, founded by Gandhi, which called upon the Durban City Council to end the restriction of non-Europeans by opening the library to all sections of the community. The pressure put on the city council by the Natal India Congress forced the council to start a travelling service for non-European patrons. The Afrikaans government during apartheid passed several discriminatory legislative measures including the Separate Amenities Act of 1953, forcing councils to provide separate amenities and services for each race. If the councils were unable to provide these amenities and services to all races, they focused solely on Whites. During this time the Afrikaans government became responsible for Black library provisions while the provinces became responsible for Colored, Indian and White library provisions, a fact that took two years for the South African Library Association to find out. =20th century= Wolfsburg Municipal Library by Alvar Aalto, built 1958-62 In the 20th century, many public libraries were built in different Modernist architecture styles, some more functional, others more representative. For many of these buildings, the quality of the interior spaces, their lighting and atmosphere, was becoming more significant than the fa√ßade design of the library building. Modernist architects like Alvar Aalto put great emphasis on the comfort and usability of library spaces. The Municipal Library he built 1958‚Äì62 for the German city of Wolfsburg features a great central room for which he used a series of specially designed skylights to bring in natural light, even though all the walls are covered with books. =21st century= In the 21st Century, libraries continue to change and evolve to match new trends involving the way that patrons consume books and other media. More than ever, the 21st Century library is the digital library. As of 2016, over 90% of public libraries have e-book collections, and over 25% circulate e-readers or tablets. Librarians are increasingly responsible for both physical and digital collections. A digital collection can include sources created and distributed digitally, to physical documents scanned and provided in a digital format. Digital libraries bring with them a whole host of new challenges such as: how the resources are distributed to patrons, whether or not authentication is required and the compatibility of patron hardware or software. Additionally new trends attract patrons to libraries for purposes other than books. The Maker Movement and Maker-spaces are a new trend designed to foster creativity and provide a space for library users to tinker, invent and socialize. Maker-spaces feature both high and low-tech media, though many focus on advanced technology such as 3D Printers or Virtual Reality and making them available to users who might normally not have access to them. Many might also feature Video and Audio recording studios, complete with advanced computers to help users edit their creations. A challenge commonly faced by 21st century libraries are budget- cuts, forcing librarians to become more efficient in the management of their funds and more vocal in the advocacy of their libraries. The American Library Association maintains a web page on navigating a challenging budget year.

It is one of the oldest business firms in Chennai city.  History  Binny and Co was founded in Madras by John Binny as a general, clearing and forwarding agency in 1797. Initially, the company functioned from a building then known as Amir Bagh on Mount Road, where the headquarters of the Indian Overseas Bank is now located. The company, then moved to a house a few blocks away, where Hotel Taj Connemara is now situated. The firm moved to its present headquarters in Armenian Street in 1812. With the passage of time, Binny and Co entered the banking and insurance sectors. John Binny set up a partnership with one Mr Denison and renamed the company as Binny and Denison in 1800. Binny and Co were the landing agents for the British India Steam Navigation Company and had a fleet of 35 barges and 30 lighters to transport men and goods from ships to land. They also ran a motor bus service for land transportation. Binny and Co was one of the founding members of the Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Binny and Co set-up the Buckingham Mills in 1876 followed by the Carnatic Mills in 1881. Both were merged to form the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in 1920. The Bangalore Cotton, Silk and Woolen Mills was set-up in Bangalore in 1884. The Buckingham and Carnatic Mills was the most long-lasting among the company's ventures.  Decline  Binny and Co suffered heavily from the crash of the bank Arbuthnot & Co on 22 October 1906. India's independence on 15 August 1947 further crippled the fortunes of the company. The Buckingham and Carnatic Mills, the company's only venture that was still successful, began to decline by the 1970s. The mills closed down their operations in 1996 and the mills were sold out in 2001.

From left: monk R., Everwin and Hildebert (h. pictor), depicted at the bottom of a scene from the Olomouc Collectarium. Hildebert and Everwin were two lay medieval artists. They are the first artists known by name who were active in the area covered by today's Czech Republic. They worked as illuminators in the scriptorium of Bishop Jind≈ôich Zd√≠k in the first half of the 12th century. The scriptorium, which was at that time the most important illuminators' workshop in Moravia, was located in Olomouc. Hildebert and Everwin depicted themselves in two illuminated manuscripts of around 1140. They took part in creating the Olomouc Collectarium (known also as the Olomouc Horologium or Horologium Olomucense). They also participated in illuminating the manuscript De Civitate Dei, written by Augustine of Hippo. It is now in the Capitular Library in Prague (codex A 21/1, fol. 153r). It is thought that Hildebert was the master illuminator, while Everwin was an assistant or apprentice. They are probably best known from an image that appears at the end of the manuscript of De Civitate Dei. Hildebert is depicted sitting, dressed in layman's clothes. Everwin is sitting below him, drawing an ornament on a sheet of parchment. Hildebert's clenched fist is raised and his gaze is directed to a nearby table (which is called Mensa Hildeberti, or Hildebert's table). On the table, a mouse is eating a piece of bread. An open book on Hildebert's writing desk shows a Latin inscription which reads: \\"Pessime mus, saepius me provocas ad iram. Ut te deus perdat\\" (\\"Most wicked mouse, you incite me to anger once too often. May God destroy you.\\") It is possible that the complaint was intended as a criticism of the poor working conditions of some medieval artists.  Olomouc Collectarium  The manuscript of the Olomouc Collectarium is the most significant work created in Zd√≠k's scriptorium. It has its origin in the 1130s - 1140s and contains 446 illuminations. The most renowned scene from the manuscript depicts Pope Gregory the Great, who is surrounded by two groups of noblemen, clerics and Benedictine monks. Hildebert, Everwin and the monk R. (apparently the scribe of the manuscript) are depicted at the bottom of the scene. During the Thirty Years' War, the manuscript was taken to Sweden as war loot, and is now in the National Library of Sweden (codex A 144). In 2009, it was lent for research purposes to the Czech Republic.  References   Further reading   Ulrich Rehm: Lieber Brot als M√§use!

He is known for holding a world record as the head of the \\"world's largest existing family\\" with 39 wives, 94 children, 14 daughters-in-law and 33 grandchildren, 180 in total and counting. The family is now living in Baktawng village, Mizoram, India. Ziona was featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! top 11 strangest stories for the year 2011, and in 2013's Ripley Believe It or Not book 9. Religious faith Ziona is chief of the group known as \\"Chana Pawl\\", which was established by his father. The sect practices polygamy. Chana sect followers claim that its origin is traced to the Bible's Revelation Chapter 20 to \\"Kum Sang Rorel\\" or the rule of 1,000 years by Jesus Christ on Earth. The sect was originally named Khuangtuaha Pawl, after the founder Khuangtuaha. He founded it on 12 June 1942, when its disciples were removed from Hmawngkawn village by the headman of the village for propagating a theology considered \\"wrong and dangerous\\". The sect celebrates its founding day as \\"Bawkte Kut\\" or the festival of the hut on 12 June every year. Members of the Chana sect number about 2,000 who reside in the Baktawng Tlangnuam village. Family life Ziona hails from the village of Baktawng in central Serchhip district, which is to the south of Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram. He was born on 21 July 1945. He married at the age of 17 to Zathiangi, his first wife, who is older than him by three years. She controls the household activities of the family with strict discipline. Ten of his wives he married in the span of one year. Ziona built a four-storied mansion which appears like a boarding house, to accommodate his large family. The house is called the \\"Chhuan Thar Run\\" or the House of the New Generation and is located in the mountainous village of Baktawng. There is also a 'Khualbuk' or a guesthouse to accommodate visitors coming to the village. Ziona has a double bedroom in the ground floor of this mansion and his wives take turns to sleep with him according to a roster. His younger wives stay close to his room on the same floor and there are always seven to eight wives attending to his needs during the day. All older wives live in the dormitories on the first floor of the mansion, while his younger wives live on the ground floor. His wives claim that there is no rivalry among them. Of his 39 wives, 22 are below the age of 40 and they get a week to spend with him. He has 26 sons-in-law and his daughters live separately with their families. He says that he has named all his children and grandchildren and he remembers the names of every member of his family. Ziona's family is self-reliant, growing crops for their food requirements. He has also established a school for his children, and his younger brother looks after its functioning. Though teaching in the school is based on a curriculum prescribed by the government, he has added some subjects specific to his Chana sect. He does not seek any assistance from the government. Ziona's wives do the cooking, and his daughters attend to cleaning of the house and take care of washing laundry. Men of the family attend to livestock rearing, agriculture (jhum cultivation), small cottage industries of wood furniture (carpentry), aluminum utensil making, and so forth. Ziona's 68th birthday was celebrated on 21 July 2013 with 150 guests. Ripley's Believe It or Not!, while recording Ziona's family as the largest living family in the world, observed: \\"It's a safe bet that Ziona Chana would not be impressed watching 19 Kids and Counting or Sister Wives.

It is a common beach shrub throughout the Arabian Sea, the tropical Indian Ocean and the tropical islands of the Pacific Ocean. There has long been confusion over the correct scientific name for this species. It is also known by the synonym Scaevola sericea. Description Scaevola taccada is a large bush reaching up to about 4 m in height typical of littoral zones where it grows very close to the sea exposed to the salt spray, usually on sandy or pebbly soils. Leaves are slightly succulent, about 20 cm long, closely alternate and crowded at the stem tips. They are glabrous with a fleshy-looking yellowish green color. The fruits and flowers are white. Scaevola taccada blooms the whole year round and the flowers have a fan-like shape which gives them the name fanflower or half flower. The fruits float in seawater and are propagated by ocean currents, this bush being one of the pioneer plants in new sandbanks in tropical areas. Scaevola taccada is similar to Scaevola plumieri ‚Äì both were included in the original circumscription of the species. S. taccada has evident calyx lobes and white fruit on which the calyx lobes persist. S. plumieri has short or absent lobes on its calyx and black fruit when ripe. File:Scaevola taccada fruit.jpgWhite fruit of S. taccada with persistent calyx lobes File:Scaevola plumieri 2.jpgBlack fruit of S. plumieri Taxonomy Two shrubby Scaevola species occur along the coasts of tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They sometimes occur in the same region, but one is more western, reaching Atlantic coasts, and one more eastern, reaching out into the Pacific. Carl Linnaeus initially included both species in his Lobelia plumieri, which he later considered to be the sole species in his new genus Scaevola (although the combination Scaevola plumieri was first published by Martin Vahl). There has been confusion for many years over the correct name of the two species when they are recognized as distinct. Scaevola plumieri (L.) Vahl is now used as the name for the western species. The earliest name now recognized as applying to the eastern species, Lobelia taccada, was published by Joseph Gaertner in 1788. William Roxburgh indirectly referred to this name when transferring it to the genus Scaevola in 1788. Separately, and later, Martin Vahl described Scaevola sericea in 1791, based on a specimen from Niue, a small island in the south Pacific Ocean. In 1980, Jeffrey argued that the correct name for the species was Scaevola sericea, since Roxburgh's transfer was not acceptable under the nomenclature code. However, Green in 1991 considered that Jeffrey was mistaken, the transfer being valid, so that the correct name for the eastern species was Scaevola taccada, the name used, for example, by the online Flora of China. The International Plant Names Index accepts this analysis. Distribution The coastal areas and beaches of Okinawa, Taiwan, Southern China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, East Timor, Northern Australia, Polynesia, Melanesia, Micronesia, East Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, Oman, Yemen, India, Maldives, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Chagos Islands, Comoros, R√©union. Habitat Scaevola taccada typically grows directly on the beaches of tropical coasts with a preference for beach crests on coral sands. It grows within in the salt spray area and it is amongst the first pioneer plant colonisers on tropical atolls and sandbanks. Besides seeds, it is easily propagated from cuttings. It prefers well drained sandy soils and it is a very salt tolerant scrub. Scaevola taccada is sometimes found growing in loose plant communities with coconut palms, soldierbush, beach morning glory, beach gardenia, several pandanus species, beach calophyllum followed by portia tree, sea almond, beach hibiscus, Cordia subcordata and others. The plant is often featured prominently on tropical island postcards and wallpapers. { - valign=\\"top\\" Habitat, Seychelles Seashore habitat on a beach in the Seychelles. } { - valign=\\"top\\" Habitat, Maldives Habitat, Kuramathi, Maldives.

It is also planted on the beach crests to protect other cultivated plants from the salt spray.

Bower has been elected to three two-year terms as the Mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, beginning in 2007. Most recently, because of a loophole in the term limits rule, Bower was able to run for an open commission seat, but lost by a considerably large margin in the run-off race against retired banker, Joy Malakoff .Bower won re-election to her third and final term as mayor on November 1, 2011. She is the first woman, as well as the first Hispanic, to serve as Mayor of Miami Beach. She is a Democrat, though Miami Beach elections are nonpartisan. Bower was born in Cuba and immigrated to the United States. She attended Miami Technical High School and became a dental assistant. Bower also spent decades as a local activist and preservationist, including advocacy for the successful preservation of the Miami Beach Architectural District. Bower served as a Miami Beach city commissioner from 1999 to 2007 before being elected mayor of the South Florida city in 2007. She won re-election to a second term in 2009. The city of Miami Beach received a bond rating upgrade in 2010 and saw a balanced budget that same year under Bower. However, pension costs have risen to more than $50 million in 2011, up from just $3.5 million in 2000. She has also dealt with controversy surrounding Urban Beach Week. In 2011, Bower announced her re- election campaign for a third, and final, term as Mayor of Miami Beach. (Mayors are term limited to three, two-year terms in office).

Biography He was born at Mausitz (near Pegau), in Saxony. In 1857 he became director of the agricultural experiment station of Brandenburg and Niederlausitz at Dahme, from which he resigned in 1873, and in 1882 accepted a similar post at Bernburg, where he died. From 1873 to 1882, he was Wanderlehrer (circuit riding teacher) at Bernburg. Nitrogen fixation Among his many agricultural investigations with plants, the most important by far are his demonstration of the ability of leguminous plants to assimilate the free nitrogen of the air, and his discovery of the tubercles on the roots as the agency through which this takes place. The question of the ability of leguminous plants to use the nitrogen of the air had long been one of inquiry, and its settlement by him marked an epoch in the agricultural world. The important parts of these experiments he published in Untersuchungen √ºber die Stickstoffnahrung der Gramineen und Leguminosen (Investigations into the Nitrogen assimilation of the Gramineae and Leguminosae; Berlin, 1888), and Ueber Stickstoffnahrung landwirtschaftlicher Kulturgew√§chse (On Nitrogen assimilation in agricultural crops; Vienna, 1890).

In accordance with the hostage release agreement, reporting on the incident was restricted until the fall of Gadaffi in 2011.  Timeline  March 1984 Four Libyan nationals were arrested on charges following explosions at Manchester and London Heathrow in the UK and were remanded in custody.Libya ‚Äì statement by Larry Pressler in a session of the UN General Assembly on November 19, 1986, CBS Interactive Business Network Resource Library 17 April 1984 WPC Yvonne Fletcher was hit by a bullet from a burst of machine-gun fire from within the Libyan Peoples' Bureau (Libyan Embassy) in St James's Square, London. She died shortly afterwards. That evening, Doug Ledingham, the airport manager for British Caledonian Airways at Tripoli Universal Airport, Libya, was arrested by soldiers. 17 to 27 April There was a standoff between the Libyan and British governments over the pursuit of who shot WPC Fletcher. The standoff resulted in the breaking of diplomatic relations by Britain with Libya, and the return to Libya under diplomatic immunity of the occupants of the Libyan Peoples' Bureau in London. Rumours abounded at the time as to the fate of the person who is alleged to have fired the fatal shots from the Libyan People's Bureau. In 1986, a British businessman who had worked for Colonel Gaddafi's regime reported WPC Fletcher's killer had been hanged as soon as he returned to Libya.. Following the breaking of diplomatic relations with Libya, the British Embassy in Tripoli was evacuated by the British and ransacked by the Libyans. A skeleton staff of British diplomats took up office in the Italian Embassy. 14‚Äì16 May 1984 Four further British men in Libya were rounded up and detained as hostages against the four arrested Libyan nationals in Britain by those claiming to be officials of the Gaddafi regime. The men in order of capture were: Michael Berdinner, Alan Russell, Malcolm Anderson and Robin Plummer. At first, Allen Russell and Malcolm Anderson were held at a separate location where they were questioned and beaten. Ledingham, Berdinner and Plummer (Plummer in solitary confinement) were in the same facility, the Italian Mansion, a building approximately 400 yards distant from the Italian Embassy. 12 June 1984 A month after being taken hostage, the five men were allowed a meeting with the British Second Consul, George Anderson, who was able to offer only pastoral care and contact with home, but no suggestion of release. It was clear by this time, however, that the men were being held as hostages by one of Col Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees, in defiance of international law. Return to their respective prisons was followed by little or no improvement in the hostages' circumstances. 19 July 1984 A second meeting with George Anderson resulted in all the hostages being put into one location, the Italian Mansion, and being fed an improved diet and given medical attention. This improvement in circumstances was accompanied by a slow but inexorable descent into gloom of the hostages isolated from all news of the outside world. Meanwhile, in Britain, unbeknownst to the hostages, their families, notably Pat Plummer and Carole Russell, were working tirelessly with Kate Adie of the BBC and Brent Sadler of ITN to keep the hostages' plight in the media to keep the situation in the news and the profile high on the government's agenda. By now, the families were being kept up to date on a daily basis by contacts within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London as to the stalemate between Libya and Britain, with a continual decline in international relations between Libya and most of the rest of the world. Summer 1984 In London, a committee in parliament was held to determine whether or not what the British government had done over the Libyan hostage situation was reasonable. The committee concluded that in the circumstances, the British government had done all it reasonably could in the light of what little was known at the time. 7 August 1984 The Libyans allowed family members to visit the hostages. These visits brought unofficial news of the, as yet, publicly undisclosed involvement of Terry Waite, the Special Envoy to the Archbishop of Canterbury, of the Church of England.Terry Waite, Taken on Trust, 1993, Hodder and Stoughton, UK 1 September 1984 Doug Ledingham and George Bush, another prisoner, arrested and detained on bona fide charges unrelated to the Libyan hostage situation, were freed and allowed home. On the day of their release, British television news was granted access to and showed the world for the first time, detail of the hostage situation. 17 October 1984 Two of the wives of the hostages, Pat Plummer and Carole Russell, attended a meeting with the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The two wives petitioned for a representative of the British Government to go to Libya and start negotiations for the release of the hostages. This meeting was soon followed by the arrival in Libya of Terry Waite. 21 October 1984 Alan Russell and Malcolm Anderson were removed from the Italian Mansion and taken to the Libyan courts, where they were charged with transporting state secrets. 10‚Äì18 November 1984 Terry Waite was in Libya. The hostage situation showed no signs of thawing, in spite of national and international efforts to secure the release of the hostages and the intervention at a pastoral level of Waite. 13‚Äì14 December 1984 Allen Russell was placed on trial and charged with sharing state secrets with British journalists. Robin Plummer seized the opportunity to speak to the press post being question and states his innocence and makes a plea for warm clothing. 24 December 1984 The four men were confirmed as political hostages by Gaddafi. Waite held a Christmas carol service with the hostages. 6 January 1985 Col Gaddafi himself placed the matter of the remaining hostages before the members of the Basic and General Peoples' Congresses, the system of democracy prevalent in Libya at the time, for a decision on the release of the hostages. 1 February 1985 Then WPC Fletcher's memorial was unveiled temporarily disrupting negotiations and sent a very clear message to the Libyans. 5 February 1985 The Congresses voted by an overwhelming majority to release the hostages. But there were conditions to the release. The release was however subject to a few days' delay, for undisclosed reasons. 7 February 1985 After almost nine months (294 days), the hostages arrived back in England.  Conditions for release  The conditions were as follows: #Britain should undertake not to support \\"stray dogs\\" (political exiles),Gadaffi still hunts 'stray dogs' in UK, Martin Bright, The Observer, Sunday 28 March 2004 to hand them over, and to stop antagonistic acts against the Libyan people; #British Government to work for release of the Libyan prisoners in the UK; #The Anglican Church to undertake to look after Libyan students in Britain and to endeavour to secure release of Libyan prisoners; #British Government to stop anti-Libyan propaganda channelled through British media; #Her Majesty's Government to undertake to treat Libyans in accordance with international law.  Aftermath  An interpretation of Condition 4 could include a complete absence in any British-controlled media of any reference to the Libyan hostage situation for fear that any such reference might be construed by the Libyan authorities as a breach of Condition 4. In accordance with this interpretation, there has been almost no reference to the hostage situation in literature since the time of the release. Most references that state the history of Libya at the time make reference to the murder of WPC Fletcher and then make no reference whatsoever to the hostage situation, skipping instead to the bombing of Libya by the Americans in 1986.

It is native to the islands of Leyte, Samar, Negros and Mindanao in the Philippines. Taxonomy It is most closely related to the Philippine hawk- eagle (Nisaetus philipensis) with some taxonomists still considering it a subspecies, and Changeable hawk-eagle (Nisaetus cirrhatus) and hawk eagle species which is commonly distributed in Southeast Asia. Distribution and habitat Its natural habitat is tropical moist highland forests approximately above 1200 meters above sea level. It is threatened by habitat loss. Pinsker's hawk-eagle shares with Changeable hawk-eagles in terms of forest habitat. However, as endemic species it occupies the interior forest and high elevations compared with the most commonly distributed N. cirrhatus. This case is also similar with the situation of the Javan hawk-eagle (Nisaetus bartelsi) and endemic hawk eagle in Java Indonesia whereby the endemic species similarly occupies the interior and more elevated forest. Status and conservation Based on unpublished data collected by the curators taking care of a captive Pinsker's hawk in Philippine Eagle Conservation Center (Philippine Eagle Foundation), every breeding season the natural pair hawk eagles produces one egg. The incubation takes 47 days, relatively close with the Javan hawk-eagle, in some irregular cases, 49 days is the longest ever recorded. Unlike the Philippine eagle which is naturally producing one egg in every two years, the N. pinskeri lays egg every year. The pair rare the young up to five months even in captivity. After five months the fledgling stage takes place. During this time, the parent hawk eagles will intentionally stop delivering the food within the nest platform, instead to the nearest branch and eventually to the distanced branches to encourage the young for branching and flying in short distances. After flight training the parent hawk eagles will push the young for dispersal and look for its own niche. Still in captivity, during incubation period only the female hawk eagle will brood the egg. The role of the male is to deliver food to the nest. However, the nest building and nest material collection is a sole responsibility of male. The curators will introduce different kind of twigs and leaves coming from the native tree species in the Malagos watershed. The male eagle will then choose the best material for nest building. In captivity, copulation takes place four times every day and breeding season starts in early September to October and approximately courtship begun by March. References * Clements, J. F., T. S.

Bright Lights! Big Screen! is a trivia video game developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (WBIE), and part of the Scene It? series of games. It was released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii on November 17, 2009 in North America, and in December 2009 in Europe and Australia. The game features puzzles from high-grossing films at the time and from films considered the best. Gameplay Scene It? Bright Lights! Big Screen! features more than 2,800 questions based on contemporary ( present-day) and classic cinema. Players compete to provide the most correct answers to a series of questions and brain-teasers, which are often based on video clips or stills taken directly from feature films. After watching a sequence from a famous movie, players may need to choose the next line spoken (for example), or recognize the events taking place in a movie by quickly studying a freeze-frame of the action. The Bright Lights! Big Screen! edition of the game uses 23 categories of questions and puzzles. As in earlier Scene It? games, available for use on standard DVD players as well as on home computers and consoles, the controls are simple; the challenge is in recognizing the scenes and remember the characters or events hinted in the question. In Bright Lights! Big Screen!, which is designed especially for play on consoles, players can choose movie- themed outfits and props to customize the avatar character that represents them in the game. Development Screenlife announced the game in a press release on September 2, 2009. It was to be the first game in the series to be also available for PlayStation 3 and Wii, as well as the Xbox 360. Screenlife and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (WBIE) also announced a distribution agreement where WBIE will handle worldwide distribution of Scene It? Bright Lights! Big Screen!.

Reception The game received mixed reviews from critics. Official Xbox Magazine called it \\"A decent upgrade or introduction to the series\\". GameSpot noted \\"This movie trivia game offers consistent multiplayer fun despite its limited feature set\\". IGN stated \\"Scene It? Bright Lights! Big Screen! gets a few things right that a trivia game should ‚Äî the clips are plentiful, the round with the edited photos is fun, and there's a fair amount of questions here ‚Äî but the things it misses sink any shot this game had at being something you need to play\\". GameZone commented \\"Scene It? features plenty of movie trivia factoids to keep cinemaphiles happy, but a dearth of features (no online play?!?) and the availability of other, better trivia games for PlayStation 3 makes me doubt that this was ever intended for the big screen to begin with\\". In contrast, Game Revolution cited \\"Scene It? can only be entertaining ‚Äî not to mention, fair ‚Äî if everyone playing not only has comparable movie knowledge but also comparable gaming experience, which is completely ridiculous for a casual party game.

The motto appears on the standard of the President of the Czech Republic, which the Czech Constitution designates a national symbol. Before the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the motto was the motto of Czechoslovakia and appeared on the standard of the President of Czechoslovakia as well. The motto is believed to be derived from Jan Hus' phrase \\"Seek the truth, hear the truth, learn the truth, love the truth, speak the truth, hold the truth and defend the truth until death\\". The phrase thus appears along the base of the Jan Hus Memorial in Prague. Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, the first President of Czechoslovakia, adopted the shortened phrase \\"truth prevails\\" as a presidential motto shortly after independence from Austria-Hungary in 1918. The sentiment was echoed over 75 years later in V√°clav Havel's notion of \\"life in truth\\" and in his famous statement \\"Truth and love must prevail over lies and hatred\\" (). The Latin version \\"Veritas vincit\\" was in use on the presidential banner from 1990 to 1992 as a linguistically neutral compromise reached between the Czech and Slovak political representation. The concept of truth has a long tradition in Czech political thought. Jan Hus and John Amos Comenius connected the truth with theological aspects, while in Masaryk's ethical concepts truth was seen as the opposite of lie. Hus' credo traditionally had been seen as testifying the moral and spiritual, rather than physical and military strength. The Charter 77 movement had the motto \\"Truth prevails for those who live in truth\\". Other uses * Part of this motto is used as the tagline for the English version of the manga and anime series, Case Closed. (\\"One Truth Prevails\\") See also * Satyameva Jayate, the national motto of India that has the same meaning.

Eight of the Taranaki players were playing their first first-class match. =1891‚Äì92= * In January 1892 Taranaki travelled to Clive, near Napier, to play Hawke's Bay at Farndon Park. The match was all over in one day. Taranaki made 70 and 39, and Hawke's Bay, scoring 103 and 7 for no wicket, won by ten wickets. Hawke's Bay's Arthur Gore took 2 for 21 and 6 for 26 and made the highest score of the match, 33 not out.

Life His father was Drekale and his mother was the daughter of a vojvoda of Old Kuƒçi. He had a brother, Nikolla who died with his father in a raid by Kelmendi. The memory of the event has been retained in the folk poem and song Pogibija vojvode Drekala i njegova osveta (The death of vojvoda Drekale and his revenge) that was recorded in the 1930s. A gravestone was placed in 1979 in Rikavaƒçko Jezero, very close to the Montenegro-Albania border, where he is thought to have died. The earliest description of him is in the report of the Venetian Mariano Bolizza, who travelled in the lands of modern Montenegro and northern Albania to document possible trade routes to Istanbul. In his report, Bolizza notes that Lale Drecalou and Nico Raizcou (Niko Rajckov) were the commanders of the Catholic Albanian Kuƒçi (Chuzzi Albanesi) which had 490 households and 1,500 men-in-arms described as very war-like and courageous. This community had settled in the area of Kuƒçi in the 16th century under Drekale's command. They were among the highland communities that actively fought against the Ottoman Empire; others included Vasojeviƒái, Bjelopavliƒái, Kelmendi and Hoti. He appears to have taken part in various assemblies of coordination against the Ottomans. In 1608, he participated in a meeting of Serbian Patriarch Jovan II Kantul in the Moraƒça monastery. In 1614, he was one of the chief participants and organizers of the assembly of Kuƒçi. In that assembly 44 leaders mostly from northern Albania and Montenegro took part to organize an insurrection against the Ottomans and ask for assistance by the Papacy. Gjon Ren√´si had undertaken the task of presenting the decisions of the assembly to the Papacy. It was followed by an assembly in Prokuplje in 1616 and another one in 1620 in Belgrade, where he appears as one of the participants. He is buried in the courtyard of the church of Ljes, in Kuci. A turkey oak tree stands on his grave. Folk tradition maintains that it was planted the day he was buried. That is why it's called Ljaljev cer (Lale's cerrus).  Conversion  Lale Drekalov was born and raised as Roman Catholic. At some point in the first half of the 17th century he converted to Orthodoxy. The actual date of his conversion is a matter historical dispute. Marko Miljanov, himself a direct descendant of Lale Drekalov through the Popoviƒái brotherhood, mentions that he converted after an agreement with Ruvim III, Metropolitan of Cetinje.Marko Miljanov, Drekaloviƒái - porijeklo, Vojvoda Drekale As Ruvim III lived after the probable life span of Lale Drekalov, Rufim Njegu≈° who played a key role in the conversion of Kuƒçi and Bratono≈æiƒái to Orthodoxy is the more historically grounded alternative as Jovan Erdeljanoviƒá and Sima Milutinoviƒá Sarajlija have pointed out. Drekalov's conversion was soon followed by a gradual conversion of all Catholics of Kuƒçi. As Francesco Bolizza notes in a letter to Cardinal Caponi in 1649, about three or four Catholic villages remained in Kuƒçi under the jurisdiction of the Franciscan mission of Gruda. The date of conversion also coincides with his second marriage. He was first married to unnamed woman from Kastrati with whom he had one son, Vuko. He then married a relative of the Bratono≈æiƒái vojvoda. In the more historically grounded version she was the daughter of vojvoda Stanoje Radonjin and sister of Pejo Stanojev Baleviƒá. With his second wife had four sons: Vujo≈°, Iliko, ƒåejo and Mijo, progenitors of the big Kuƒçi brotherhoods: Vujo≈°eviƒái, Ilikoviƒái. ƒåejoviƒái and Mijoviƒái. The brotherhood of Ilikoviƒái was further diversified thus the surname disappeared, whilst Vuko because of the dispute with his half-brothers settled in Podgorica and converted to Islam, his descendants being known as Turkoviƒái. Lale Drekalov was first succeeded by his oldest son Vujo≈° as Voivode, but the position was later transferred to Iliko. After his death begins the branching of the Drekaloviƒái into a union of brotherhoods as opposed to being a single brotherhood. The event of the wedding has also been recorded as folk story with a metaphorical segment where the vojvoda of Bratono≈æiƒái presents Lale with his famous mace as a gift, only to be later warned by his kinsmen that with the mace he handed over all the prosperity of the Bratono≈æiƒái tribe to Lale as well. The story illustrates the exploits of Lale, since under him and his sons Kuƒçi became the largest and most powerful tribe in the Montenegrin Highlands.Jovan Erdeljanoviƒá, Pleme Bratono≈æiƒái Sources Category:Converts to Eastern Orthodoxy from Roman Catholicism Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from Montenegro Category:16th-century births Category:17th-century deaths ","title":"Lale Drekalov"},{"id":"33654672","title":"All Hours"},{"id":"33654693","text":"Judy Joo is a Korean American chef and television personality.

The Nait≈ç clan remained in residence until the Meiji Restoration. Afterwards, the castle site was used for a high school, Toyota City Art Museum, and a park.

After a series of studies in the late 1950s, the Air Force had concluded that the maximum efficiency would be gained by using only liquid hydrogen fuel for upper stages, which demanded the use of boosters based on segmented solid fuel rockets.Robert Godwin, Dyna-Soar: Hypersonic Strategic Weapons System, pp. 141-142, Apogee Books, 2003 . By combining one of three upper stages with three different diameters of solids built to any length needed, the SLS provided wide flexibility in launch capability. The SLS was one of two programs being designed at different divisions within the Air Force, with the ultimate aim of providing the launch services for the X-20 Dyna Soar manned spaceplane.

It was developed by German studio Soft Enterprises and produced by Data Becker. It has been released on the January 20, 2003. There are four major sections in the Highland Warriors campaign: * The unification of the clans under a single king. * The conquest of Scotland by England. * The rebellion of William Wallace and his uprising against the English army (during the 14th century) * The reunification of the tribes by Robert the Bruce and the declaration of independence.  Gameplay  Highland Warriors brings the traditional gameplay of a typical RTS game: The exploitation of the resources is necessary to build bases, which at their turn will allow to create armies and then attack the enemy to achieve victory. There are five types of natural resources: timber, food, stone, iron ore and gold. Each side has different units. Beside the regular ones (infantry, cavalry, ranged, and siege units) some factions even have magic-using units, such as druids, mages, and rangers. Also, the game does not provide any information about the units, except for their price; so to judge a given unit, one would have to guess from its cost. One noticeable point, though, is Highland Warriors gameplay feature known as \\"Blood Frenzy\\": in this mode, soldiers will spread and automatically attack closest enemies. The downside of this is that the player lose the control of any attacking units.  Reception  The game has been met with mixed reviews, holding a score of 58 on Metacritic. GameSpot states that its \\"historical accuracy doesn't compensate for the deficiencies in its gameplay and graphics.\\" References Category:2003 video games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Video games set in Scotland ","title":"Highland Warriors"},{"id":"33655094","text":"Randers Cultural Centre (1969) Flemming Lassen (23 February 1902 ‚Äì 18 February 1984) was a Modernist Danish architect and designer, working within the idiom of the International Style. Among his most notable buildings are libraries and cultural centres. He was the brother of Mogens Lassen, also an architect. Early life Flemming Lassen was born on 23 February 1902 in Copenhagen into an artistic family. His father Hans Vilhelm Lassen was a decorative painter and his mother, Ingeborg Winding, was a painter. He trained as a mason before completing his education at the Technical School. After working in a number of different architecture studios, in the 1930s Lassen set up office with Arne Jacobsen with whom in 1929 he had won a Danish Architects Association competition for designing the \\"House of the Future\\". Built full scale at the subsequent exhibition in Copenhagen's Forum, it was a spiral-shaped, flat- roofed house in glass and concrete, incorporating a private garage, a boathouse and a helicopter pad. Other striking features were windows that rolled down like car windows, a conveyor tube for the mail and a kitchen stocked with ready-made meals.Fritz Hansen, \\"Biography + Resources: Egg Chair designer Arne Jacobsen\\", Fritz Hansen.

The three-storey rectangular building in reinforced concrete is illuminated from a central courtyard while the walls along the streets are free of windows. In the 1970s, together with his son Per Lassen, he designed a number of libraries including the public library in Lund, Sweden, the central library in Herning, the library and community centre in Hvidovre and the municipal library in Hobro.

All that now remains of it is the front portion of the abbey church, which is now used as a parish church.  History  The abbey was founded in 1148 by a knight, Stephan of M√∂rlheim, and settled by twelve Cistercian monks from Villers-Bettnach Abbey in Lorraine (of the filiation of Morimond). The monks' first task was the clearing of the river valley, to make it cultivable. In 1186 Emperor Frederick Barbarossa put the monastery under Imperial protection. It subsequently received rich gifts, including many vineyards in the south of the Palatinate. A village quickly grew up round the monastery. The monks served at Trifels Castle as chaplains, and watched over the Imperial Regalia while they were kept in the castle during the 12th and 13th centuries. Eusserthal never founded any daughter houses, but it had a priory at M√∂rlheim. After that the importance of the abbey declined. In the 15th century it was looted several times. In 1525, during the German Peasants' War, it was looted and set on fire; it was rebuilt in 1552 under Abbot Martin II. In 1561 Elector Frederick III dissolved the abbey in consequence of the Reformation. In the 17th and 18th centuries several attempts were made to revive the monastery, but without success.  Church building  The building of the church is thought to have been begun about 1220; it was dedicated in 1262. The plan and basic structure are Romanesque but the vaulting shows Early Gothic influence. In accordance with Cistercian custom the church has no towers, just a fl√®che, or miniature spire, over the crossing, and the interior is without colour. The construction is of local red sandstone. The structure is of a pillared basilica of three aisles and a transept on a Latin cross ground plan. The vaults in the nave and the choir are secured by open buttresses. The resemblance to the church of Otterberg Abbey, which was built earlier, is unmistakable, although the church at Otterberg is larger. The conventual buildings and the cloisters have disappeared, and of the church there now remain only the choir, the transept and the first bay of the nave. In the wall of the choir is a rose window with tracery, and over the arch of a door a well-preserved relief sculpture of a dragon in sandstone. In the 18th century the remains of the abbey church were re-worked as a parish church. At that time the upper window openings were closed and the ruins of the bulk of the nave were demolished, and replaced by a simple west front. The acoustics of the resulting building are ideal for the performance of church music, and the summer concerts held here are well-known. In 1961 substantial restorations took place, which have had the effect of emphasizing the Romanesque character of the structure.

Such behaviour could be selected for if larger group size increases the chance of survival of the individuals in the group. Supported hypothesis of selection mechanisms towards increasing group size currently exist, in helping raise other animals' offspring (alloparental care) and performing other cooperative breeding acts including kin selection. It is currently proposed that group augmentation may be another mechanism (closely related/connected to cooperative breeding) which occurs through the recruiting of new group members and helping of unrelated individuals within a group.  Group Augmentation Mechanisms  Group augmentation can occur via two separate mechanisms. Passive group augmentation is described as the mere presence of other individuals in a group providing a benefit to a group member. Where as active group augmentation is described as the presence of other individuals causing no benefit or a detrimental effect to a group member; but where the presence of the other individuals later increases the overall level of reproductiveness of the group, also known as delayed reciprocity. An example of the phenomenon of delayed reciprocity (or \\"returning the favour\\") is where an organism will help raise an un-related individual at a cost, and once the individual is an adult it helps the organism which raised it; either by its presence increasing group size, or by assisting in breeding activity. Research suggests that both types of group augmentation can be used to explain the expensive helping behaviour of non-reproducing subordinate individuals as evolutionary stable. It is also important to note that both forms of group augmentation are thought to act in tandem with kin selection to further explain increased levels of helping behaviour. Aside from helping to raise offspring, another way by which helping behaviour leads to group augmentation is through lowering group mortality (through actions such as vigilance behaviour). Group augmentation is proposed to help explain the evolution of helping behaviour, such as cooperative breeding. Group augmentation may be used in cooperative breeding groups, in particular, to explain helping behaviour between individuals which have low relatedness. Certain species show that costly helping behaviour which can not be explained solely by kin selection, may be explained by the underestimated value a large group to an individual.  Species Specific Examples  = Meerkat (Suricata suricatta) = The meerkat is one species where group augmentation is suspected to be an important driver of cooperative behaviour. It is believed that relatedness degree, or kin selection, is not the only driver of helping behaviour in meerkats, as research has demonstrated that weight, age and sex of the subordinates may better correlate with helping babysitting behaviour. As meerkats have been noted to help un-related individuals, one potential explanation is the benefit of increasing group size (as group size is correlated with survival); this non-related altruistic behaviour is thus thought to be a cooperative behaviour driven by group augmentation. = White Winged Choughs (Corcorax melanorhamphos) = The White Winged Choughs display a unique behaviour, according to some research, of kidnapping and raising unrelated young. In one experiment spanning four years a total 14 young birds were regarded to be \\"stolen\\" from one group of Choughs to another, here it is evident that kin selection is likely not the driving force as stolen individuals were captured from seemingly un-related groups. Associated research has concluded that helpers (which can include young birds) are necessary for successful reproduction, and no instance of successful breeding has been noted to occur without helpers. Here group augmentation theory is largely supported as it was also demonstrated that reproductive success linearly increased with group size, and the choughs are actively recruiting new unrelated members. = Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) = Chimpanzees are a nonhuman primate which exhibits an interesting cooperative behaviour of territorial boundary patrolling. As with most cooperative behaviours some aspects are strongly attributed to kin selection; including an increased incidence of patrol behaviour when offspring were present in the group. Other aspects of this behaviour however were better attributed to the group augmentation theory, in that, the chimpanzees had individuals which routinely patrolled at high cost although the immediate gain was minimal, but led to a larger group size and future potential for reproductive success. Evidence of this cooperative behaviour being related to group augmentation was based on the fact that some males were notice to patrol, even when there were no offspring or maternal relatives in the group. Further observations included that increase in group size did not impact the totally patrolling effort of the group, so helping behaviour was continuously attempting to increase group size.  Criticism of Group Augmentation Hypothesis  The group augmentation hypothesis is not universally accepted by all ethologists, as other well studied explanations for cooperative behaviour exist. Kin selection has been largely proven to be the main driver of the cooperative breeding strategy, though the application of Hamilton's rule across a large variety of studies. Kin selection is the theory that animals act altruistically towards members of their own species in a ratio which is dependent on how genetically related those individuals are to one another. A further criticism of group augmentation predictions replacing or occurring in tandem with kinship, is that the augmentation theory lacks clear empirical data. It is also argued that animals live in groups only for the purpose of an immediate net benefit towards reproductive success. One study of a bird obligate cooperative breeder in particular showed that, while breeding success was dependent on cooperative behaviour, linkage to kinship was ultimately able to explain the behaviour of those species. Overall, literature suggests more empirical data is required for group augmentation theory to be generally accepted.

It lives on fire corals of the genus Millepora in the Atlantic Ocean from Florida to southern Brazil. Ecology Millepora alcicornis, one of the species of fire coral inhabited by Me. stultus Megabalanus stultus is one of three species of barnacle that live on fire corals (the genus Millepora). Savignium milleporae lives in the Indo-Pacific and lives on 9 species of Millepora; Megabalanus ajax lives in the western Pacific and lives on Millepora platyphylla; Me. stultus lives in the western Atlantic, and lives on Mi. alcicornis and Mi. complanata. The nature of the relationship between M. stultus and the coral is unclear. At low densities, the barnacle has no discernible effect on the coral, but high-densities of coral-inhabiting barnacles can disrupt the growth of the colony. Distribution In his original description of the species, Darwin reported that M. stultus occurred in Singapore and the West Indies. In 1968, Arnold Ross considered the reports of M stultus from the Pacific Ocean to be erroneous, limiting the type locality to the West Indies. M. stultus has subsequently been reported from Taiwan in the western Pacific, and those records have been reassessed as referring to the related species Megabalanus ajax. M. stultus is now thought to occur exclusively in the western Atlantic, including the Caribbean Sea, from Florida to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Description Megabalnus stultus differs from the other species of Megabalanus in that the basal margin is sinuous, rather than straight, and protrudes medially, whereas in other species it protrudes little if at all. The shell is \\"dirty white\\" in colour, often with a purple tinge, and pale blue in parts. Taxonomic history Megabalanus stultus was first described by Charles Darwin in 1854, under the name Balanus stultus. It was placed in the subgenus Megabalanus by Ross in 1968, which was raised to the rank of genus in 1976.

It is a former town house that is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Forest House was built as a town house for the Barnston family of Crewe Hill. The date of its construction in uncertain; one source states 1759, others say in the 1780s. It was at one time \\"possibly the finest Georgian house in Chester\\", and a prominent landmark in the city. Only the central block now remains. During the 19th century it was used as auction rooms, then a furniture depository, and following which it was used as a night club. The building was a Wetherspoon pub between 2008 and 2016. It reopened as a Brew House pub in October 2016. Architecture The house is constructed in red-brown brick with stone dressings, standing on a stone plinth. It has a grey slate roof. The remaining part of the house consists of two blocks. The block on the corner of Love Street and Forest Street has two storeys and a basement. The west front faces Love Street and has five bays. The lower storey contains a damaged central round-arched doorway, with rusticated jambs, voussoirs, and a triple keystone.

It stars Anil Kapoor, Raveena Tandon and Rambha in pivotal roles. The film is a remake of the Tamil film Thaikulame Thaikulame (1995), starring Pandiarajan which was remade in Telugu as Intlo Illalu Vantintlo Priyuralu (1996), with Venkatesh and in Kannada as Naanu Nanna Hendthiru (1999) with Ravichandran. Plot Arun (Anil Kapoor) is married to Kaajal (Raveena Tandon) and they have been trying to conceive a child for some time. After going for some tests, the doctor (Asrani) informs them that they cannot, and this is due to shortcomings from Arun. However, the doctor then secretly confesses to Arun that it is in fact Kaajal who cannot conceive, to spare her from the shame that would have followed in Indian society. Arun's father, Hiralal (Kader Khan) discovers this and tries to force Arun to marry again as he wants a grandchild - however, Arun refuses to marry anyone except for Kajaal. One day, Jumbo (Satish Kaushik) and Arun go to Nepal, were Jumbo comes across a girl, Manisha (Rambha), who is about to be publicly disgraced. He arranges the girl's freedom by stating that Arun will marry the girl - without conferring with Arun. Arun attends the wedding ceremony, unbeknownst to him that he is in fact the groom and the ceremony is being performed around him, owed essentially to the fact that they were speaking a different language and the ceremony was different from that in India. Shortly after the ceremony, he discovers that he is now married to Manisha, and had been tricked into doing so by Jumbo. Arun returns to India, where he remains in contact with Manisha, who learns to speak fluent Hindi from their mutual friend Gopal (Tiku Talsania), whom they met in Nepal. Hiralal now desperately wants a grandchild to lighten up his life, so he requests the couple to adopt a child. However, by this time - Arun now has a child with Manisha in Nepal and proceeds to adopt the child with Kajaal - named Rinku - and \\"employ\\" Manisha in their house as a maid to allow Manisha to be near her son - all unknown to Kajaal. Hiralal discovers that Manisha is in fact Arun's wife and Rinku is their blood-child and begins to secretly dote upon Manisha, while Kajaal criticizes the relationship that the \\"employer and servant\\" shared. One evening, after Hiralal and Manisha return from the cinema, Kajaal confronts her father-in-law as to why he is favoring the house-maid over his own daughter-in-law; out of anger, Kajaal attempts to throw Manisha out of the house. Arun intervenes and then declares that Manisha has just as much as right to this house as she does, and even more right to be with Rinku than Kajaal - as his wife and Rinku's biological mother. The story concludes with everyone accepting the situation of polygyny and living together. Cast * Anil Kapoor as Arun H. Verma * Raveena Tandon as Kaajal A. Verma * Rambha as Manisha A.

He brought her to Kassel in 1813, leading to a de facto termination of his marriage with Princess Augusta of Prussia, but for political reasons, he was not allowed to divorce his wife. In 1815, William and Augusta were separated from bed and board. Emilie was admitted at court, and later lived in the at the corner of K√∂nigsstra√üe and Friedrichsplatz. In 1821, William raised her to Countess Reichenbach (named after Reichenbach Castle in Hessisch Lichtenau) and in 1824, she received the Austrian title of Countess of Lessonitz after William had purchased the Moravian estates of Lessonitz, Bzenec and Doln√≠ Mo≈°tƒõnice for her. At the same time she and her children received the Austrian citizenship. Their relationship caused a scandal; they even received death threats. The Countess was probably unpopular and was alleged to have had a negative impact on William's politics, or at least some of his political failures were attributed to her. Their relationship was one of the reasons why the William did not return to his capital Kassel after the 1830 revolution.

The marble sarcophagus was commissioned by the Countess's children and created in 1863 by the sculptor Eduard Schmidt von der Launitz. Elector Frederick William, who had succeeded his father by then, tried every diplomatic means available to prevent his father's sculpture from being installed in the mausoleum, but achieved nothing in the Free City of Frankfurt.Margret Lemberg: Die Grablegen des hessischen F√ºrstenhauses = Ver√∂ffentlichungen der Historischen Kommission f√ºr Hessen vol. 71, Marburg, 2010, p. 186.

The headwaters of the creek originate south of the city of Syracuse near the hamlet of Vesper, in the town of Tully, New York. The creek flows north through the Tully Valley and through the city of Syracuse where it empties into Onondaga Lake. The major tributaries of Onondaga Creek are the West Branch of Onondaga Creek, Hemlock Creek and Rattlesnake Gulf.  History  Onondaga Creek at Fayette Street about 1885 The settlement that became Syracuse arose in a forested swampy area at the creek outlet in the early 1800s as a result of the state of NY constructing the Erie Canal and developing salt production on the shores of Onondaga Lake. From this time forward, the natural meandering flood plain of the creek was periodically channelized and straightened to facilitate uncontrolled development of the creek-side and flood plain upstream towards the Onondaga Nation Reservation. A \\"progress\\"-based economic cycle involved land developers purchasing farmland and building in the adjacent rural towns, followed by flooding, sewage, water supply, and school crises. The city of Syracuse would then respond to petitions by the new homeowners and businesses to formally ask the state legislature to annex these lands. By the turn of the twentieth century, this cycle accelerated due to the city acquiring water rights to Skaneatles lake, and the development of street car lines. After a series of major floods, the city engineer was authorized by the state to study the whole watershed. The 1927 report concluded that the region had experienced much heavier rainfalls in the preceding decades than had Onondaga Creek, so the in the future floods could be significantly larger. In addition, the anticipated uncontrolled sprawl up to the Onondaga Nation reservation would in effect block the remaining overflows to the farmland flood plain further increasing peak flood flows. the City Engineer recommend the construction of two flood control dam within Onondaga reservation, just inside the northern and the southern boundaries. There were no city, state or federal funds available for such a project. The Onondaga nation and the Iroquois Confederation strongly opposed this taking. In 1936 Congress passed the Federal Flood Control Act. It provided funding for construction. States had to acquire land rights, and were responsible for operation and maintenance.

He was the uncle of Oliver Cromwell, the Member of Parliament, general, and Lord Protector of England. Biography Born around 1562, Cromwell was the eldest son and heir of Sir Henry Williams, alias Cromwell, of Hinchingbrooke, and his wife Joan, a daughter of Sir Ralph Warren, Lord Mayor of London. He matriculated from Queens' College, Cambridge, at Lent 1579 and was admitted at Lincoln's Inn on 12 May 1582. He lived at Godmanchester until the death of his father. Cromwell held a number of local offices: In 1585 he was captain of musters for Huntingdonshire and at the time of the Spanish Armada he was one of the officers in charge of the men raised in Huntingdonshire. He was recorder of Huntingdon in 1596. He was Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire from 1598 to 1599 and while Sheriff, in 1598, Queen Elizabeth may have dubbed him a knight bachelor.Sources are divided on the knighthood: Bennet and other sources state that he was, but Shaw & Burtchaell do not record the knighthood in their list of knights bachelor and Poulton wrote in 1982 that Mark Noble \\"is incorrect however in giving Master Oliver's knighthood as 1598\\" (, ) and ). He was a Justice of the Peace from about 1585 but was removed in 1587, when there was one of the periodic purges of justices. In 1594 he was restored to his position as a J.P.; as the online History of Parliament observes: \\"It was felt that in a county as small as Huntingdonshire, the custom by which only one member of a family could be a justice was inapplicable ‚Äî particularly in the case of the owners of Hinchingbrooke.\\" Cromwell was first elected one of the members of parliament for Huntingdonshire in 1589. He was re-elected to each Parliament up to and including the Addled Parliament of 1614 (that is, in 1593, 1597, 1601, 1604, and 1614). In 1621, the seat was occupied by Richard Beavill, but Sir Oliver stood for and was elected to the Happy Parliament of 1624, and its successor, the Useless Parliament of 1625, after the dissolution at King James' death.For a list of the Parliaments of Queen Elizabeth, see , for a list of the Parliaments of James I and the early Parliaments of Charles I, see Hinchingbrooke House He entertained King James at Hinchingbrooke on 27 April 1603, when the King was travelling south to occupy the English throne. Cromwell's presents to the King included \\"a cup of gold, goodly horses, deep- mouthed hounds, and divers hawks of excellent wing\\" and a some of the heads of Cambridge University came dressed in scarlet gowns and corner caps to present a Latin oration. It was described as \\"the greatest feast that had ever been given to a king by a subject\\". In gratitude King James conferred the Order of the Bath upon Cromwell at the coronation on 24 July 1603. He became attorney to Queen Anne of Denmark and a gentleman of the privy chamber. On 6 January 1604, his father died and Sir Oliver succeeded to Hinchingbrooke and the family estates; about 1605, he also succeeded to his father's office, Custos Rotulorum of Huntingdonshire. King James was frequently at Hinchingbrooke, apparently treating the place as his own ‚Äì in 1614 he appointed a keeper of the wardrobe there. By 1623 Sir Oliver was trying to sell Hinchingbrooke to the King, to pay off his debts, but the death of James I in March 1625 ended the negotiations on Hinchingbrooke. Hinchingbrooke was finally sold on 20 June 1627 to Sir Sidney Montagu. Other estates had been sold to meet debts contracted to London moneylenders and he was left with the property at Ramsey, Cambridgeshire. Cromwell was loyal to the crown at the outbreak of the English Civil War. His nephew and godson Oliver Cromwell was sent by parliament to the house at Ramsey to search for arms which could be sent to the King at York. The younger Cromwell is said to have stood head uncovered in the presence of his uncle. Later the Ramsey estates were sequestered but were restored to him on 18 April 1648 through the influence of his nephew who became the Lord Protector. Cromwell died in 1655 and was buried at Ramsey on the same day, 28 August, to prevent his body being seized by creditors. According to Sir William Dugdale, he died two days after becoming 'scorched' when falling or collapsing into a hearth at his home while drying himself after being out in rain. Marriages and issue Cromwell married firstly Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Bromley, the Lord Chancellor and Elizabeth Fortescue, by whom he had four sons and four daughters: * Henry * John * William * Thomas * Hannah * Katherine * Jane * Elizabeth He married secondly in July 1601, Anne, widow of the financier Sir Horatio PalavicinoPollard, A. F. Palavicino, Horatio. Dictionary of National Biography, 1885‚Äì1900, Volume 43. and daughter of :de:Gillis Hooftman of Antwerp, by whom he had two sons and two daughters: * Oliver * Giles * Mary * Anne He had a total of twelve children, he himself being the oldest of 11 siblings: two of Cromwell's sons by his first marriage subsequently married two of Anne's daughters by her first marriage. Another daughter, Elizabeth (probably also by his first marriage), married secondly the Roundhead Sir Richard Ingoldsby: one of their many children, Richard Ingoldsby, was among those who signed Charles I's death warrant. His second son John married Abigail Clere, daughter of Sir Henry Clere, 1st Baronet; Abigail is familiar to readers of the Diary of Samuel Pepys as \\"Madam Williams\\", who left her husband to live openly with Pepys' colleague William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker. It seems that John and Abigail, like many of the Cromwells, thought it prudent after 1660 to use the older family name Williams. Another daughter, Mary, married Edward Rolt in 1628. Mary died in 1634. He was the brother of Richard, Robert (the father of the Lord Protector) and Henry Cromwell.

In the mid-nineteenth century the building, which had fallen into a ruinous state, was acquired by the Englishman John Temple-Leader and entirely reconstructed in the feudal style. Between 1941 and 1943 it served as a small prisoner-of-war camp known as Castello di Vincigliata Campo P.G. 12. It housed some high-ranking British and Commonwealth officers, including Major-General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, who was employed by the Italian government in the Armistice negotiations with the Allies in 1943.  Original castle  The 13th-century castle located on a hill north of Florence close to Fiesole is medieval in origin. It was once the ancient stronghold of the Visdomini family, important Florentine nobility since the 11th century.Scott, p.7. They enjoyed special privileges from the Florentine bishops. A son of the family John Gualbert, a Benedictine monk, was canonized in 1193 by Pope Celestine III. The property then passed to the Usimbardi family, (which introduced glass production to Florence) followed by the Ceffini of Figline. They soon sold it to the Buonaccorsi banking family. In the general crash of Florentine banks in 1345 (bad debts by King Edward III of England for his Battle of Cr√©cy and Battle of Poitiers (1356) campaigns) it was purchased by Niccolo, son of Ugo degli Albizi, a wealthy mercantile family.Scott, p.18. A branch of this family, for reasons of political expediency renamed Alessandri, occupied the castle for some three hundred years. After the fall of the Republic, the Alessandri family still kept up their palace in the city, but the castle was allowed to drift into decay, till by the year 1637 only the Lord Francesco lived there with a 10-year-old son, Giovani Antonio, and a maiden aunt of 70. The ruins and land were sold in 1827 to Lorenzo di Bartolommeo Galli da Rovezzano Scott, p.28. They became a source of interest to writers and artists during the romantic era, as evidenced by an Emilio Burci sketch dated 1836. The courtyard of Vincigliata Castle in 1901  John Temple-Leader  John Temple-Leader , as a young Whig politician, suddenly abandoned a parliamentary career for the continent. In the early 1840s after several years in Cannes, he moved to Florence, taking a house in the Piazza Pitti. He became a friend of Georgio Barbera, a Florentine publisher and supporter of the unification of Italy. Later he purchased Fiesole's Villa di Maiano and joined Tuscany's sizeable English expatriate community. Whilst exploring the hills of Fiesole, the Englishman came upon the overgrown ruin of Castello di Vincigliata. He fell in love with it and decided to restore it to its former glory. Over 15 years, the castle was reconstructed in the neo-Gothic style from the ground up. With the help of a young architect, Giuseppe Fancelli,Scott, p.31. it became a romantic vision of a feudal fortress. He also bought the surrounding land, more than seven hundred acres in the space of fifty years, began the delicate task of reclaiming it and restoring the houses and villas. He created the Bosco di Vincigliata, planting cypresses in the rocky areas where nothing else would grow, with pines and all the various shrubs and bushes one finds in a typical central Italian woodland; in short, an English romantic garden on a huge scale. People flocked from afar to visit his castle and admire the grounds, and he was extremely pleased when The Illustrated London News printed an engraving of Queen Victoria doing a watercolour of the Giardino delle Colonne, a pretty pool fed by the Mensola creek, during her visit in 1893. Henry James wrote of the castle: \\"This elaborate piece of imitation has no superficial use; but, even if it were less complete, less successful, less brilliant, I should feel a reflective kindness for it. So handsome a piece of work is its own justification; it belongs to the heroics of culture.\\" The gate of the castello is flanked by two stone lions and leads into an Italian garden with a fountain and a sunken cloister. Originally there were many Gaetano Bianchi (1819‚Äì1892) frescoes of scenes from the lives of the various families that owned Vincigliata, but only one has survived, Ugolino de'Visdomini invoking the Virgin before marching against the Sienese. In 1889 he published the definitive record on Sir John Hawkwood, an English mercenary (or condottiero) active in 14th-century Italy. Sir John married late in life and died in Florence in 1903, without heirs. He left all his properties, including the Castello di Vincigliata to his great nephew Richard Luttrell Pilkington Bethell, 3rd Baron Westbury, who sold it off piecemeal, and his art collection was scattered.  POW camp  The castle was requisitioned by the Italian government during World War II and was designated P.G. 12 Vincigliata, as a prisoner-of-war camp for distinguished military prisoners. It was a much smaller camp than the others, with no more than around twenty-five prisoners at any one time. The officers were separated from the non-commissioned officers and the only link between them was via the officers' batmen or servants who attended them. During the ebb and flow of the North African Campaign 1941/2, a number of high-ranking British officers were captured. On arrival in Italy, most British POWs passed through the Italian transit camp at Capua and then moved to more permanent camps. In early 1942, the Italian army began to reorganise their POW camp system and commenced to number and classify them. The large camp at Sulmona, holding as many as 3,000 prisoners, in the Abruzzo outside Rome, became known as Campo concentramento di prigionieri di guerra 78, abbreviated to P.G. 78, which held a large number of British and Commonwealth officers and other ranks. A small number of these senior officers and NCOs secured in the Villa Orsini were sent further north to P.G. 12 Vincigliata. They included Air-Marshal Owen Boyd, Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor, Lieutenant-General Philip Neame, and Major-General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, who wrote, \\"We learned that Vincigliati (sic) had belonged to an Englishman, a man called Temple-Leader. We considered he had restored the castello in the most thoughtless fashion, giving all his attention to what went on above ground, and regardless of the many underground passages that he had sealed up. He made things very difficult for us.\\"Carton de Wiart, p.192. The castle also included New Zealander Brigadiers Reginald Miles and James Hargest who reflected in his book, \\"One thing the late Temple-Leader had certainly done: he had erected a structure ideal for the purpose it was now put to‚Äîa prison.\\"Hargest, p.74. =Known prisoners, September 1941 ‚Äì September 1943= British and Commonwealth officers ;Brigadier Bertram Frank Armstrong DSO (1893‚Äì1972) Armstrong, a South African, was the commanding officer of the 5th South African Infantry Brigade, which formed part of the South African 1st Infantry Division, formed August 1940. It served in East Africa and the Western Desert. He was captured at Sidi Rezeg in North Africa on 23 or 24 November 1941. He had the nickname \\"Oubaas\\" [and] \\"...was a jolly soul, who seemed quite undisturbed by prison life in Vincigliata.\\"Leeming, p.111. He received the DSO in 1942, and escaped during the Italian Armistice in September 1943‚Äîinitially with other officers, including Dan Ranfurly, walking over the Apennines and down into Romagna, guided by a Benedictine monk Don Leone. \\"It was a terrible climb for Brigadier Armstrong who had a game leg. There was not enough food in the village, so we dispersed in small parties over a district of ten miles.\\" He became a major-general, and chief of the general staff, South African Union Defence Force, before retiring in 1953. ;Air Marshal Owen Tudor Boyd CB, OBE, MC, AFC (1889‚Äì1944) Boyd was on his way to Egypt, in November 1940 as the new deputy commander of the British Air Forces in the Middle East. En route for Malta, the Wellington bomber in which he and his staff were passengers was forced down over enemy-controlled Sicily by a group of Italian fighters. After destroying his confidential papers by setting his own aircraft on fire, Boyd became a prisoner of war. He and his ADC Flight-Lieutenant Leeming, were sent to the Villa Orsini close to Sulmona PG 78, POW camp, joined later by Neame, O'Connor, Combe, Gambier-Parry, Todhunter and Younghusband, before being sent to Vincigliata some six months later. He was involved with a number of escape plans. He was an expert carpenter,Carton de Wiart, p.194. contributing to the tunnel work, and in March 1943 escaping with five other officers. After making it to Milan boarded a train for Como only to be arrested at the Swiss frontier. He escaped again during the Italian Armistice in September 1943, after time in the Italian countryside he successfully reached the Allied lines with Neame and O'Connor. He returned to England but in August 1944 he died of a heart attack. ;Major- General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart VC, KBE, CB, CMG, DSO (1880‚Äì1963) De Wiart came from a well-connected continental family and was appointed by Churchill as head of a military mission en route to Yugoslavia. He was captured when his Wellington aircraft from Malta crash-landed in the sea off the coast of North Africa in April 1941. He had won a VC in World War I, on the Somme, being wounded eight times and losing a hand and eye. He was the alleged model for the flamboyant Brigadier Ritchie-Hook in Evelyn Waugh's Sword of Honour trilogy. He was sent to the villa Orsini (referred to as Medici in his book) close to Sulmona P.G. 78. Later, with other officers, he was sent to Vincigliata, where he made many escape attempts including through a successful tunnel with five others in March 1943. He managed to evade capture for eight days disguised as an Italian peasant, no mean feat considering that he did not speak Italian, and was 61 years old, with an eye patch, and one empty sleeve. He was captured and returned to Vincigliata for the obligatory 30-day solitary confinement.Neame, p.309. In August 1943 he was selected by the Italian authorities to accompany an Italian negotiator, General Zanussi, to Rome then Lisbon to meet Allied contacts to facilitate the surrender. When they reached Lisbon, Carton de Wiart was released and made his way to England, by plane the same month. Within a month of his arrival, Churchill informed him that he was to be sent to China as his personal representative to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. He left by air for India in October 1943. In November 1944 he was promoted to lieutenant-general. At the war's end he retired to Ireland, and married for the second time. ;Lieutenant-Colonel John Frederick Boyce Combe, CB, DSO & Bar (1895-1967) Combe was a British Army officer before and during World War II. He was commanding officer of the 11th Hussars for the initial stages of the Western Desert Campaign. He was twice awarded the DSO for his service in the Western Desert Campaign before being captured in Cyrenaica in April 1941, with O'Connor and Neame. In Vincigliata he became one of the gardeners, as well as keeping sixteen hens, \\"and tended them like a mother.\\"Neame, p.76. He was an enthusiastic escaper, taking turns in tunnelling, and one of the six officers to escape in April 1943. Unfortunately he was caught the next morning at Milan railway station, whilst studying a timetable.Neame, p.308. He escaped again with all remaining officers and men during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. He reached Camaldoli with Neame, O'Connor and other British officers. In Romagna, he joined the Italian partisans led by Libero as Riccardo Fedel was known.Lamb, pp.202‚Äì207. He arrived at Allied lines in May 1944, rejoining the Eighth Army. In October 1944 he was given command of 2nd Armoured Brigade, until after the German surrender, with the rank of colonel. In 1945, he had brief periods as an acting major-general commanding successively 78th Infantry Division and 46th Infantry Division in Austria. In October 1946 his rank of major-general was made permanent and he was appointed Deputy GOC British Troops Austria. He retired from the army in October 1947, and married the same year. In 1945 he had become Colonel of the Regiment of the 11th Hussars, taking part in the procession behind the coffin at the funeral of King George VI in 1952. He relinquished the post in 1957. ;Colonel George Hew Fanshawe, CBE (1899‚Äì1974) Born into a military Oxfordshire family, Fanshawe became a career soldier, serving in India where he met and married Mary Holme Wiggin in 1926, at Sialkot, India, they had a son Hew Dalrymple Fanshawe born in 1927. During World War II he was the commanding officer of The Queen's Bays (2nd Dragoon Guards) part of the Royal Armoured Corps, and was captured in North Africa, and arrived at Vincigliata in 1942. As Neame recorded in his book, \\"Colonel G. Fanshawe also joined us at Florence, but Younghusband and Fanshawe were sent away to make room for more senior officers.\\"Neame, p.288.Carton de Wiart, p.193. He was transferred to Veano Camp P.G. 29, in Piacenza, Northern Italy. After the war he was gazetted in 1946, lieutenant-colonel (acting brigadier), (13054), The Bays, (seniority, July 1942). He was gazetted a brigadier in December 1948. He was appointed a CBE in the New Years Honours list 1953, and was commander, Royal Armoured Corps, between March 1951 and October 1952, when he retired to Oxfordshire. ;Major-General Michael Denman Gambier-Parry, MC, (1891‚Äì1976) The Gambier-Parrys of Highnam Court, Gloucestershire; were an artistic and military family ‚Äì his uncle Ernest Gambier-ParryThe Times, Obituary, 17 April 1936. was a major in the army sent to Egypt to avenge the death of General Gordon, and wrote a book (Suakin, 1885) about his experiences. Michael joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers in 1911. As a captain in World War I, he served in France (awarded the Military Cross) and at Gallipoli. Promoted temporary lieutenant-colonel, he transferred to the Royal Tank Corps 1924. In World War II he was aide-de-camp to the King, then headed the British Military Mission to Athens in 1940. In 1941, as general officer commanding the 2nd Armoured Division, North Africa, he was captured with Brigadier Vaughan at Mechili in April 1941. He arrived at Villa Orsini near Sulmona with Neame, O'Connor, Combe and Younghusband, and was sent to Vincigliata the same year. As Carton de Wiart wrote of him \\"... he was also a most gifted man, made delightful sketches, was a first class 'forger' ‚Äì which could no doubt earn him a steady income in the underworld.\\"Hargest, pp.113‚Äì114. Known as 'GP', he was a knowledgeable musician, \\"and led the choir in our church services on Sunday.\\" \\"'GP' was one of the few really unselfish men I have ever known.\\"Leeming, p.96. In September 1943, he escaped with the other officers and after various adventures arrived in Rome. He initially obtained sanctuary in a secret room within Signora Di Rienzo‚Äôs fourth-floor apartment in the Via Ruggero Bonghi. Later he was hidden in a hospital on Via Santo Stefano Rotundo run by the Little Sisters of Mary; all arranged by an Irish priest known as the ‚ÄòVatican Pimpernel‚Äô pp.109-112, The Vatican Pimpernel, Brian Fleming, Skyhorse Publishing Inc, 2012, ,‚Äòunder the noses‚Äô of the Germans until the allies arrived in June 1944. He retired soon after, becoming Deputy Lieutenant of Wiltshire, and died in 1976. ;The Rt Rev George Vincent Gerard, CBE, MC (1898‚Äì1984) During World War II Bishop Gerard was the military chaplain to the New Zealand forces and was captured in North Africa. He was for a short time imprisoned in Vincigliata until he was repatriated to Egypt in June 1943. He was educated at Christ's College, Canterbury and Brasenose College, Oxford. After serving with the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) in World War I, he was ordained in 1923 and embarked on his ecclesiastical career in New Zealand, becoming the 7th Anglican bishop of Waiapu, from 1938 to 1944. ;Brigadier James Hargest CBE, DSO & 2 bars, MC, ED, MP, (1891‚Äì1944) Hargest came from a New Zealand farming family. In World War I he served in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, commissioned as a second lieutenant. He fought and was wounded in the Gallipoli Campaign, and later fought in France, being awarded the Military Cross, the DSO, and the French L√©gion d'honneur. In 1931, he was elected to Parliament as the MP for Invercargill. During World War II, he was able to use his political connections to get an appointment as a brigadier in 1940, and took part in the Battle of Crete, where his incompetence and indecisiveness allowed the German parachutists against the odds to gain a foothold at the Maleme airfield that lost the Battle of Crete for the allies. Nevertheless, he was decorated. later his brigade took part in the defence of Tobruk, where he was captured in November 1941. It is inexplicable that the Italians didn‚Äôt release him to do more damage on his side. He and his servant, Howes, were sent by sea and rail to Italy arriving just before Christmas at the Villa Orsini near Sulmona.Hargest, p.55. He was joined by fellow New Zealander Brigadier Miles. Hargest and other officers were transferred to Vincigliata by train in March 1942. Several escape attempts were made but his successful escape was through the tunnel in March 1943. He and Miles paired up for the escape and managed to travel to Milan by train and onward to Como and finally across the Swiss border. On arriving Hargest wrote \\"We raced up the hill into thick forest. Reg cried, 'Jim, we're in Switzerland!' I dived into my case and hauled out the three-ounce bottle of rum. We drank to our freedom.\\"Hargest, p.131. After travelling alone through France and Spain to Gibraltar he reached England by air in November 1943. As New Zealand's observer he travelled back to France on D-Day 1944. On 12 August he was killed by a shell-burst and is buried in Normandy. ;Flight Lieutenant John Fishwick Leeming (1895‚Äì1965) Leeming was a Lancastrian with a keen interest in aviation. He had built a glider with friends in 1922 and formed the Lancashire Aero Club, becoming its chairman. In 1926 he was the first to land an aeroplane on a mountain (3,117 ft up Helvellyn in the English Lake District). He sold his first published article at 13 and during the 1930s became internationally known for his books. He joined the RAF and was with Air Marshal Boyd as his aide-de-camp when their Wellington bomber was forced down over enemy-controlled Sicily in November 1940. After destroying confidential papers by setting the aircraft on fire, including some ¬£250,000 in currency (although some was secretly hidden for possible escape),Neame, p.292. he and Boyd became prisoners of war. They were sent to the Villa Orsini, close to the Sulmona POW camp near Rome. Six months later they were moved to Vincigliata P.G. 12 near Florence. As Lieutenant- General Neame wrote, \\"Leeming gave up running the mess in December 1941, after we had been in Florence for three months to devote himself to the plot.\\" \\"His character interested me. I place him as an extremely shrewd man, very persistent and determined, but pleasant to deal with, with a most kindly nature and a flair for getting on with nearly anyone. But he delighted to appear to others as simple and easily overcome by circumstances, a pose which he developed so successfully that he managed to get himself repatriated as a very bad nervous-breakdown case. I must say he worked hard for months on this astounding plot. He succeeded so well that the international medical board, with Swiss and Italian doctors, unhesitatingly accepted his case for early repatriation,\\" (in April 1943 via a military hospital in Lucca).Neame, pp.283‚Äì284. \\"However, he reached England and returned to duty. We used to spend many hours on the battlements of Castello di Vincigliata discussing [my] book, how to be an author and many other matters.\\"Neame, p.284. Leeming was influential in the escape plans, suggesting using the castle well system,Neame, p.294. camouflaging,Neame, p.295. and coding secret communications to MI9.Neame, p.310. After the war he returned to business in Manchester. He continued to write books and his experience as a POW in Italy was the inspiration for his novels. ;Brigadier Reginald Miles, CBE, DSO & Bar, MC (1892‚Äì1943) Reggie Miles, a New Zealander, served as an artillery captain at Gallipoli and was badly wounded in July 1915. In France, during the battle of the Somme, he was awarded the Military Cross in December 1916. In May 1917 he was promoted to major. The following year he received a DSO (recommended for the Victoria Cross) and was mentioned in dispatches in November 1918. In World War II he served in the Greek campaign, was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Greek Military Cross (first class). Rejoining his division in North Africa, in December 1941 his 6th Field Regiment was overrun by German Panzers near Belhamed, and he was wounded in the back by shrapnel and taken prisoner. He and Hargest arrived in Vincigliata in 1942. He settled into camp routine, becoming a gardener, and was actively involved in escape attempts. Together with Hargest he escapedNeame, p.303. to Switzerland ‚Äìthe only two of six officers who escaped from the castle through a tunnel which he helped to build, in April 1943. Neame received a coded letter announcing their success a fortnight later. Miles was made a CBE and received a bar to his DSO for his \\"splendid achievement in escaping.\\" However, having travelled as far as the Spanish frontier on 20 October 1943, in a state of depression and exhaustion, he inexplicably shot himself and was buried in the Figueras Municipal Cemetery. He was posthumously appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1944. ;Lieutenant General Sir Philip Neame VC, KBE, CB, DSO, KStJ (1888‚Äì1978) Neame was born in Faversham Kent and educated at Cheltenham College. He joined the Royal Engineers in 1908 and during World War I had won the Victoria Cross in December 1914. Ten years later he won a gold medal for shooting at the 1924 Paris Olympics (the only VC to win an Olympic medal). These games were memorably celebrated in the film Chariots of Fire. He saw service in India, becoming a brigadier-general with Eastern Command in 1934 and then returned to England as commandant of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1938. Neame, along with Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor, were captured by a German patrol in the Western Desert Campaign in Cyrenaica, April 1941. He was sent to Italy, first at Villa Orsini near Sulmona, where he met other captured officers, as Carton de Wiart wrote: \\"General Neame well known as a big game hunter, discovered a latent talent for embroidery, and also started on a book.\\"Carton de Wiart, p.187. He later moved to Castello di Vincigliata P.G. 12, \\"Chief backgammon expert was Neame, but it made it perfectly furious to play with him, as he always seemed to have the luck of the devil.\\"Carton de Wiart, p.195. The officers started a tunnel and as Carton de Wiart explained, \\"Neame with his sapper's knowledge gave us the layout for our labours, and with such a degree of accuracy that at the end we were hardly a centimetre out.\\"Carton de Wiart, p.208. He and O'Connor took all the remaining officers and men out of Vincigliata during the Italian Armistice in 1943. They were taken to Florence railway station and put on a train to Arezzo.Ranfurly, p.236. After months in the mountains and with the help of partisans and MI9 agents he, Boyd and O'Connor finally arrived in Allied lines safely by Christmas 1943. Back in England during 1944, the Countess of Ranfurly records in her diary, \\"We paid a short visit to General Neame and his wife in their pretty house in Kent and he and Dan (Ranfurly, Neame's ADC since 1940) talked of their escapes.\\"Ranfurly, p.247. Neame served as Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey from 1945 to 1953. Philip Neame was the nephew of a founding father of the Kent-based Shepherd Neame brewing dynasty, the oldest in Kent. ;General Sir Richard Nugent O'Connor KT, GCB, DSO & Bar, MC, ADC (1889‚Äì1981) O'Connor was born in India, sent to England attending Wellington School, Somerset, and later the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. During World War I as brigade major of 91 Brigade, 7th Division, he was awarded the Military Cross in February 1915 and in March the DSO. In World War II now promoted to major-general, he was the brilliant commander of 7th Armoured Division and 4th Indian Brigade that earlier in the North African campaign had routed the Italian 10th Army, taking the surrender of 130,000 men and 400 tanks. Unfortunately, he was captured with Lieutenant-General Neame by a German reconnaissance night patrol in the desert between Derna and Mechili in April 1941.Neame, pp.279‚Äì282. He was flown to Catania and then by rail to Sulmona where he and his fellow captives were billeted in the Villa Orsini for six months before being sent to Vincigliata. He attempted many escapes and succeeded in April 1943 by tunnelling out of the castle with five other officers. 'General Dick' as the New Zealanders affectionately called him,Hargest, p.91. teamed up with Carton de Wiart and walked across the Apennines. In seven days they were far beyond Bologna, some 150 miles from Florence. They were arrested by a carabinieri patrol out looking for them. The result was a return to the castle and thirty days' solitary confinement. A few months later, after the Italian Armistice in September 1943, he escaped again, with all remaining officers and men. He reached Camaldoli with Neame, and with the help of partisans and MI9 officers reached Allied lines in Termoli by fishing boat by Christmas 1943. In 1944 he commanded VIII Corps in Normandy and later, during Operation Market Garden. In 1945 he was General Officer in Command of the Eastern Command in India. He retired in 1948. He was Lord Lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty from 1955 to 1964. ;Thomas Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly KCMG (1914‚Äì1988) Second Lieutenant Lord (Dan) Ranfurly, educated at Eton College, joined the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (Sherwood Rangers), 1st Cavalry Division, and was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Neame when they were both captured in Cyrenaica in April 1941. He was taken by ship from North Africa to Naples, then by rail to Sulmona camp P.G. 78 in the Abruzzo near Rome. Neame was taken to Villa Orsini nearby. They met again when they were both transferred to Vincigliata P.G. 12 in October 1941. He adapted to prison life and handled the officers housekeeping and Red Cross parcels. As Carton de Wiart wrote, \\"He was our most expert gambler, did me the good turn of teaching me to play backgammon.\\" He helped with the tunnel escape plans, cleverly building and disguising the escape trap to the outside world.Carton de Wiart, p.214. He escaped with other officers during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. On Florence railway station he exchanged his uniform for a civilian tweed jacket and a ticket collector's cap for a hundred cigarettes. With the help of Italian partisans and MI9 officers he reached Allied lines in Termoli by fishing boat in May 1944. His exploits in the Second World War, along with those of his wife, Hermione, and valet, Whitaker, are chronicled in the memoirs of his wife, Hermione, To War With Whitaker: The Wartime Diaries of the Countess of Ranfurly, 1939‚Äì1945. Following the end of World War II, Ranfurly worked briefly in insurance at Lloyd's of London, not long after being appointed Governor of the Bahamas by Winston Churchill. Returning home in 1957, he took up farming at his Buckinghamshire estate. ;Capt Guy Ruggles- Brise (1914‚Äì2000) Guy Edward Ruggles-Brise, educated at Eton College, joined the 104th Essex Yeomanry, and in 1940 was picked for commando training in Scotland. He departed with No 7 Commando for North Africa, where he was captured after a daring raid in 1941 and transferred to Naples by ship. He was later held at P.G. 35 at Padula near Salerno from May 1942 until June 1943. Briefly sent to P.G. 19 in Bologna before being transferred to Vincigliata in the latter days before the Italian armistice, he was among the party released by General Chiappe in September 1943. He and the others were driven to Firenze Campo di Marte railway station from where a special train took them to Arezzo. After months with the partisans in the Apennines he finally reached Allied lines in May 1944 with a group of officers including an old schoolfriend, 'Dan' Ranfurly.Ranfurly, p.241. After the war he became a stockbroker and bought an estate in Scotland where he enjoyed deer stalking. ;Lieutenant Victor Smith, RNR Lieutenant Smith, RN, of 813 Squadron FAA, , was shot down in a raid on Maritza airfield, Rhodes, on 4 September 1940. He made a forced landing on Scarpanto Island and was taken prisoner. As John Leeming, a fellow prisoner records in his book, \\"One officer Lieutenant Victor Smith, of the Fleet Air Arm, was allowed to visit us regularly. He was an accountant in civil life and helped to audit the camp books. He was held in a nearby camp Fontana D'Amore,\\" close to Villa Orsino in the Abrusso.Leeming, p.70. Carton de Wiart mentions Lieutenant Smith Carton de Wiart, p.191. together with Ranfurly as two officers joining his party at Sulmona railway station, before being sent to Campo P.G. 12 Vincigliata in October 1942. ;Brigadier Douglas Arnold Stirling (1897‚Äì1958) Stirling lived in Goring on Thames and served as lieutenant with the 13th Hussars in World War I, serving in France (Croix de Guerre, 1917) and in Mesopotamia against the Turks. He married Janet Alicia Christopher in 1924 and during the 1930s was in Egypt. In World War II he commanded the 1st Armoured Brigade, initially based in the United Kingdom and then in January 1941 it was shipped to Egypt. When Greece was invaded the 1st Armoured Brigade was sent with General Maitland Wilson's unsuccessful attempt at stopping the German invasion. In April 1941 it was evacuated to Egypt. He commanded the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own) part of 7th Armoured Division in the defence of Tobruk, where he was captured by a German reconnaissance night patrol (led by Rommel) in the desert in November 1941. He was sent to Italy and arrived at the Villa Orsini, near Sulmona, joining Brigadier Hargest and others. Hargest wrote later, \\"Stirling and I became great friends and I found him an excellent companion.\\"Hargest, p.56. \\"He was in charge of the mess catering and negotiated through an Italian officer for a goose and ingredients for a pudding for our first Christmas in captivity.\\"Hargest, p.57. He was transferred by rail to Florence and Castello di Vincigliata in March 1942. He settled into camp routine, known as 'Pip', and worked on the tunnel in shifts for many months.Neame, p.297. At Vincigliata \\"Stirling had the most desirable effect on rabbits..he ensured the success of our birthday feasts.\\" \\"Stirling was sent to Rome to be court-marshalled by a Fascist court, because he had written on a postcard that Italians were bastards. Stirling's powers of rhetoric were colossal; he practically persuaded the court that not only was it a term of endearment in English, but a compliment as well. He returned to Vincigliata and heard no more about it.\\"Carton de Wiart, p.203. He was sent to the military hospital in Lucca with Leeming in April 1942 for his duodenal ulcer.Leeming, p.174. He was returned to the camp and escaped with other officers during the Italian Armistice in September 1943 Neame, p.325. and reached Allied lines in Termoli by fishing boat by May 1944. The same year he wrote to O'Connor seeking an appointment in an armoured brigade without success. ;Brigadier Edward Joseph Todhunter TD, DL, (1900‚Äì1976) Ted Todhunter was born on his family estate Kingsmoor House and Stewards farm in Great Parndon, Essex. He attended Rugby School becoming a cadet in the O.T.C division. In 1922 he was gazetted as 2nd lieutenant in the Territorial Royal Field Artillery, 104th (Essex Yeomanry) Brigade. He married Agnes Swire in 1927. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel, and during World War II, serving as a brigadier with the RHA, he was captured at Mechili in Cyrenaica, North Africa, with General Gambier-Parry in April 1941. He was initially brought to the same barracks as Carton de Wiart in Tripoli,Carton de Wiart, p.184. then by ship to Naples and to the Villa Orsini near Sulmona. He helped in the garden and \\"collected news from Italian newspapers, making a r√©sum√© of them in English which he managed brilliantly.\\"Carton de Wiart, p.188. He was transferred to Castello di Vincligaita (P.G. 12) in April 1942, and took on the role of camp librarian, which by the spring of 1943 numbered nearly one thousand books.Hargest, p.77. He was part of the tunnelling group that worked in shifts for over six months. He escaped during the Italian Armistice in September 1943 with the remaining officers and men. They branched off into the mountains seeking refuge in the Monastery of Camaldoli. Close by, \\"he discovered a retired Dutch diplomat, Baron Quarles, who lived with his English wife (who by extraordinary coincidence had known Neame as a child forty‚Äìfive years earlier)\\",Neame, p.315. and \\"he and O'Connor used to listen to the news on their wireless.\\"Ranfurly, p.237. With the help of Italian partisans and MI9 officers he reached Allied lines in Termoli by fishing boat together with Combe and RanfurlyRanfurly, p.228. by May 1944. He was flown to England in May 1944.Ranfurly, p.230. After the war he served as High Sheriff of Essex 1964‚Äì1965. ;Captain Ernest E Vaughan, IMS (Indian Army Medical Corps Service) Taken prisoner at Tobruk Leeming, p.172. in North Africa, Vaughan was sent to Vincigliata camp as their medical officer. \\"We had applied for a doctor to swell our community, and had been allotted not only a very good doctor but a most helpful man..at heart he was a real insurgent and showed the right spirit by having a go at the Italians whenever he could.\\" He also supported the tunnelling escape plan by 'watching'.Neame, p.305. ;Brigadier Edward William Drummond Vaughan CB, DSO, MC (1894‚Äì1953) Vaughan, commanding the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade was captured at Mechili in April 1941. Vaughan's Indian Cavalry gallantly repulsed many attacks, but was eventually overwhelmed, surrendering to Rommel in person, who was leading his main armoured division.Neame, p.280. Along with other officers taken prisoner in North Africa he ended up in Campo P.G. 12 Vincigliata. In the camp he was known as 'Rudolph', becoming staff officer and efficiently running the prison camp for over two years; every one took their troubles to him. Vaughan's bathroom in the castle became an observation post during the escape tunnelling.Carton de Wiart, pp.208‚Äì209. He escaped with other officers during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. After time in the Italian countryside he successfully reached the Allied lines in May 1944. Later the same year he became Commanding Officer Delhi Area, India, and from 1945 to 1948 was ADC to King George VI. He retired to White Knights, Newick, Sussex with his family in 1948. ;Colonel George Edward Younghusband CBE, (1896‚Äì1970) He was educated at Clifton College and Eton College. During World War I he was mentioned in dispatches serving as a lieutenant, with the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own). In World War II he served with the 3rd Hussars and, after the fall of France, shipped to North Africa as Commander of 2nd Armoured Division, part of 7th Armoured Brigade. He was captured in April 1941 at Mechili with Gambier-Parry and Todhunter.Carton de Wiart, p.186. He was flown to Catania in Sicily and taken by rail to Villa Orsini near Sulmona.Neame, p.283. Six months later he was moved to Castello di Vincigliata. Along with Coombe and Todhunter he became an enthusiastic gardener and helped bring an amazing variety of vegetables and salad inside the castle walls. In April 1943 he was sent away with Fanshawe to make room for more senior officers. In March 1945 he received the CBE. He became Vice- Colonel (Hon Brigadier) 3rd The King's Own Hussars, retired, he and his family lived in Crickhowell, south Wales. He came from a long line of army officers, stretching back to the mid-18th century. He is related to Lieutenant Colonel Sir Francis Younghusband (1863‚Äì1942), a British Army officer, explorer, and spiritual writer; remembered chiefly for his travels in the Far East and Central Asia; especially the 1904 British expedition to Tibet.

O'Connor's attempt over the wall had failed, with the inevitable punishment of a month's solitary confinement. Then in mid-September 1942 a tunnel was started and designed by Neame, a Royal Engineer. Various officers took it in turns to work on it in shifts of four hours per day. This was hard blistering work, but they managed to successfully evade detection, over the next six months. It was completed by 20 March 1943.Neave, p.303. The plan was for six selected officers to escape in pairs; O'Connor with Carton de Wairt, Combe with Boyd and the two New Zealanders Hargest and Miles together. Waiting for the right conditions they eventually escaped on the evening of 29 March. Neame in his book pays tribute to the support they received from fellow POW's: \\"...while the remaining six officers and thirteen NCOs and men went through hours of tedious watching to ensure success. Every one, officers and men, were in it, and wildly keen for success!\\" In the meantime Leeming had been sent to Lucca military hospital in early April 1943 by the International Medical board, (he faked a very bad nervous breakdown) and from there by train to Lisbon where he was repatriated on the British hospital ship arriving at Avonmouth April 23, 1943. The tunnel escape proceeded brilliantly with six officers escaping (in order: Combe, Miles, Boyd, Hargest, O'Connor, Carton de Wiart) remaining undetected until the following day, enough time for the escapees to be far away. They all had their adventures some of which have been described in their books. O'Connor and Carton de Wiart (who was now aged sixty-three) were captured in the region of the Po Valley, Bologna after eight days, while Combe was caught at Milan railway station. Boyd managed to board a train and reach Como before he too was apprehended. However the New Zealanders, Reg Miles and James Hargest secured their escape by journeying by rail and then walking over the border into Switzerland. Neame received a coded letter from Miles two weeks later confirming their safe arrival. As a punishment, after the discovery of the tunnel two of the officers' batmen (Pickford and Prewett) were transferred to another camp. Eventually the four captured officers were returned to the camp for thirty days solitary. As Carton de Wiart comments in his book, \\"I learnt also that twenty-four hours elapsed before our exit hole had been discovered, and then only by Gussie's dog (Mickey, a cross St Bernard & white sheep-dog). Gussie (as Lieutenant Agosto Ricciardi their previous Italian guard and Gaoler was known) had left it behind when he had been sent away, but the dog proved too intimate a friend to us, and had unwittingly given away our secret.\\" A new camp commander was appointed and the garrison was increased by fifty-percent ‚Äì there were now some hundred infantry and Carabinieri to guard eleven officers and fourteen other ranks. The final and successful escape was not made until after the Italian surrender in September 1943. However, in the preceding months, the inmates of the castle had through MI9 contacts continued to receive parcels with much concealed escape material including over 20,000 lire in Italian money, various maps, compasses and some clothing material.Neame, p.312. Campo 12 received a Red Cross visit in December 1942; and reported, \\"This camp for British Generals continues to be satisfactory. A few minor complaints were brought forward and settled on the spot. No British chaplain has yet visited the camp.\\"POW magazine, April 1943. A visit three months later describes the camp as \\"...as being like a country house. The officers spend much of their time working in the garden.\\"POW magazine, June 1943. Then in mid-August Carton de Wiart was selected by the Italians and taken from Vincigliata to Rome as part of their proposed armistice negotiations with the allies. (He was a friend of the Italian Crown Princess ‚Äì and they hoped this connection would help). He met with the Italian Deputy Chief of Staff General Zanussi,Carton de Wiart, p.226. and after a few days they travelled on to neutral Lisbon. By the end of the month he was flown to England a free man. ;The Italian Armistice 1943 Then on 8 September 1943, the captain in charge of Castello di Vincigliata announced that the Italian government had arranged an armistice.Ranfurly, p.235. At nine in the morning two days later all the remaining prisoners of war were sent to Florence railway station as the Germans were approaching. General Chiappe, a sympathetic Italian officer arranged a special train for them to Arezzo some sixty miles south. Using the smuggled Lire currency they bought various civilian clothes from local Italians at the railway station. Suitably attired Neame, O'Connor, with nine other officers, together with fourteen other ranks under CQMS Morgan set off to evade capture.Neave, p.314. After arriving in Arezzo they discovered much confusion and a general air of despondency with many Italian officials. So the officers decided it was safer to move away the same evening with all the escaping soldiers. They travelled some forty miles northward to the Hospice of Camadoli in the Apennine Mountains. They stayed four days. Some officers climbed another thousand feet higher to the Monastery in Eremo where the Prior-General of the Camaldolese Order resided. He was pro-British ‚Äì hated the fascists and detailed one of the brothers Don Leoni to act as special liaison between the British escaped prisoners.Neave, p.316. Links with MI9 were re- established and money provided to help with food and shelter in an already impoverished Italian countryside. There was not enough food in the local village, so the escaping group was dispersed in small parties over a district of ten miles. Italy was still politically divided and word reached the Prior- General that an Italian fascist had betrayed the presence of the escaping prisoners and for their safety moved them from the Monastery to hide and live amongst the Italians in the mountain villages of Segeteina and Strabatenza some ten miles away. In September and October the soldiers helped the peasants with their manual work such as digging, fetching water and husking maize. O'Connor or Neame would make regular visits to check on the soldiers' welfare and give them any news.Neave, p.318. During this time Neame and O'Connor (who had learnt Italian whilst a prisoner) had collected another twenty or so British soldiers that had also escaped after the armistice and were wandering the mountains. As a precaution the officers built brushwood hides in the surrounding woods, to sleep overnight as there were frequent alarms about spies and impending searches. Then on the morning of 29 October, 120 Germans arrived by Italian motor-lorries and surrounded the village to search it.Neave, p.325. They had been betrayed. The approaching Germans were seen by the officers from higher up the mountains and with help from one of the guides in the village escaped. The NCO's and other soldiers were not so lucky. After two months freedom they were again prisoners of war ‚Äì this time by the Germans. After a series of escapades, by Christmas 1943 Neame, O'Connor and Boyd arrived at Termoli by fishing boat. A further five brigadiers and eleven other escapers arrived the same way by mid-May 1944.Foot, p.240. MI9 escape & evasion Amongst the many clandestine British secret services during World War II was a department known as MI9. (It was set up under Norman Crockatt, an ex-infantry major who earned the DSO and MC in World War I). It worked to train the armed forces in escape and evasion. Evasion lines were set up in occupied countries. MI9 exchanged coded letters with prisoner of war camps, and secretively sent in money, maps, clothes and many other useful tools. What the Italians never knew was that O'Connor had one of \\"Winterbottom's codes\\"Foot, p.148. and was therefore secretively in touch with London, through coded letters sent to fictitious addresses in England.Neame, pp.310‚Äì311. Aftermath * John Leeming was the first officer to reach England from the prison camp, in April 1943. However, he had been medically repatriated by feigning paranoia. * Carton de Wiart reached England in August 1943, having been involved in the Italian Armistice. He later reflected in his book Happy Odyssey (p. 184), after capture in North Africa, \\"I met Captain Camino, who had lived in England many years and afterwards proved himself most helpful to many British prisoners of war. Later Captain Camino took me on to the Cavalry barracks, where I was treated as an honoured guest, and I wish that I could meet some of those officers again and thank them for their courtesy and kindness to me.\\" * James Hargest was the first and only soldier to escape Vincigliata and successfully reach England in November 1943. In doing so, he became the highest-ranking British officer to escape in either war.Hargest, publisher's note. He wrote an account of his escape on his return in, Farewell Campo 12, with a dedication: \\"To my son Geoffrey who died of wounds in Italy, in March 1944.\\" Hargest was killed in Normandy in 1944, and his book published posthumously in 1945. * Philip Neame wrote the whole of his book, Playing with Strife, except for the last chapter, whilst a prisoner-of- war in Italy. He carried the manuscript when he was released from the castle during the Italian armistice in September 1943. It was concealed in a tomb by the Prior General in the monastery of Eremo, retrieved by a British MI9 agent (Signor Ruggero Cagnazzo) in November 1944, and finally published in 1947. Current castle  The castle pictured by John Dann in 2010 , the family owners were offering the castle as a venue for special occasions such as weddings, gala dinners and wine tastings. It has its own vineyard, the Testamatta Estate (Azienda Agricola Testamatta), run by Bibi Graetz, a wine- maker and artist who designs his own labels. He produces indigenous varieties of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Colorino. The castle was the venue for an episode of the BBC One MasterChef programme.Series 9, Episode 21, aired 30 April 2013.

Biography No Joy's first show was with Grant Hart of Husker Du on December 15, 2009. The band continued to play locally, including a show with then-up-and-coming indie band Best Coast. The latter's lead singer, Bethany Cosentino, took a liking to the band and tweeted, \\"Dude, No Joy is the best band ever. Two hot blonde girls just shredding away. Sooooo amazing\\". The band soon signed to Mexican Summer and released their first 7\\" single, \\"No Summer\\" b/w \\"No Joy\\". Its release enabled No Joy to book their own national U.S. tour, bringing along La Sera (a Vivian Girls side project) for a three-week stint of mostly West Coast shows. Around this time, London-based label Sexbeat reissued the debut 7\\" for a UK/European release. No Joy toured later that fall with Mexican Summer labelmates Dungen. The 7\\" sold out quickly, and six months later, on November 16, 2010, No Joy released their debut LP, Ghost Blonde, to wide critical acclaim. Pitchfork reviewed the album, saying that \\"The guitars, loud enough to obliterate everything within 50 yards, create a balmy atmosphere where lacerating riffs and blurry strumming shares face time with ear-piercing feedback\\". The band's strong DIY mentality in terms of producing and recording their music was highlighted in an interview with The Stool Pigeon: \\"You can record anything for free now. If you‚Äôve got a laptop or a friend‚Äôs laptop, do it yourself,\\". However they left the mixing side of the project up to the Raveonettes' Sune Rose Wagner. On working with Wagner, White-Gluz said, \\"We were recording in our space and it was sounding like shit, so we had the idea of someone helping to clean it up a little bit, but everybody in Montreal was asking for way too much money. And we‚Äôve both always liked the way Raveonettes‚Äô records sound. We exchanged emails a few times and we had exactly the same music tastes, so it just went from there\\". The final package \\"convincingly captures the gloriously fuzzy, effects-covered sound of the shoegaze era, but escapes being mere copycats by adding a wonderfully spooky atmosphere and by writing hooky, easy to swallow melodies\\", said a 4.5 star review from AllMusic. The praise for Ghost Blonde, and No Joy's notoriously loud and hypnotizing live act, garnered attention from notable publications such as The New York Times, BrooklynVegan and The Guardian amongst others. In early 2011, No Joy released 7\\" single \\"Hawaii\\" in the UK; the B-side was a remix of the song \\"Indigo Child\\" done by Stereolab's Tim Gane. No Joy toured the UK in early 2011, their first stint overseas, with Florida band Surfer Blood, and returned a month later for a European tour including a show in London with Wire and an appearance at Barcelona's Primavera Sound festival. Immediately upon returning, the band flew to SXSW where they played nine shows showcasing for media including Pitchfork, The A.V. Club and Gorilla vs. Bear. The band toured North America during the remainder of 2011, supporting Vivian Girls and then co-headlining with Marnie Stern, with whom they released a split single (No Joy contributed Shangri-Las cover \\"He Cried\\"). In June 2012, with No Joy's second album they began working with producer Jorge Elbrecht (Sky Ferreira, Ariel Pink, Japanese Breakfast) who would go on to become an integral part of the band's sound. Wait to Pleasure was critically acclaimed, receiving an 8.0 from Pitchfork. In March 2015, No Joy announced the June 9 release of their third album, More Faithful. On June 15, 2016, No Joy released Drool Sucker on Topshelf Records, the first in a planned series of EPs. It was followed by Creep, released on February 24, 2017 on new label Grey Market. Exploring an interest in electronic music, No Joy collaborated with former Spacemen 3 member Peter Kember (aka Sonic Boom); the resulting EP, titled No Joy/Sonic Boom, was released March 30, 2018 by Joyful Noise Recordings. No Joy's fourth album, Motherhood, was released on August 21, 2020 via Joyful Noise Recordings. According to the press release, No Joy is now presented as a solo project of White-Gluz, and contains no mention of co-founder Lloyd, suggesting she is no longer involved.

They formed in 2000 as a four-piece band, but following the departure of their original bass player, Gwen and Aurelien joined, and they played as a five-piece from then on. The line-up consists of lead singer Aurelien Verdant, guitarist and singer Julien Paget, bassist Gwena√´l Grosclaude, guitarist Samuel Moncharmont and drummer Beno√Æt Desvignes. They announced in 2012 that they were breaking up, and most of the members have moved on to other musical endeavours.  Music style  Da√Øtro plays a brand of chaotic hardcore punk that closely resembles that of the original screamo movement of the 1990s. They share many stylistic similarities with American bands like Orchid, as well as with other bands from the European screamo (or \\"skramz\\") scene such as Raein, La Quiete and Sed non Satiata. Their influences include several earlier screamo and post-hardcore bands, including At the Drive-In, Refused and Envy. Da√Øtro, along with many of their European and American contemporaries, were hugely inspirational to a new generation of screamo and post-hardcore bands that appeared in the late 2000s and early 2010s, such as Pianos Become the Teeth and Touch√© Amor√©.

(The whorls of the protoconch are decollated.) The five whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded. They are marked by five broad, strong, deeply incised spiral grooves, that divide the space between the sutures into raised, flattened keels, which are successively a little wider from the summit to the periphery. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a groove similar to those above. The base of the shell is rather short and moderately rounded. It is marked by five subequal and subequally spaced spiral grooves which are a little weaker than those on the spire. The entire surface of the shell is marked by slender lines of growth, and the raised spaces between the spiral grooves are finely spirally striated. The sutures are strongly impressed. The oval aperture ? (outer lip of the specimen is fractured). The columella is strong, curved, revolute and its posterior two-thirds re-enforced by the base. The columellar fold is not visible in the aperture. The operculum is paucispiral.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=236155 on 2011-11-07 Description The rather stout, milky white shell is subturrited and has a broadly elongate-conic shape. The length of the shell is 7 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are small. They are almost completely immersed in the first succeeding whorl. Only the tilted edge of two volutions is apparent, which indicates that the axis of whorls of the protconch is at right angles to the axis of the later ones. The 6¬æ whorls of the teleoconch are inflated, strongly shouldered at the summit, and decidedly rounded. They are marked by many weak, irregular axial riblets and very strong, broad, angular, incised, spiral channels. These are crossed by many more or less regularly spaced and subequally developed backward slanting axial riblets. These riblets render the flattened and faintly spirally striated, raised spaces between the incised channels feebly crenulated on both edges. Five incised channels appear between the sutures on the second and third whorl and six on the fourth and fifth. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are well rounded, the latter sculptured like the space between the sutures, with six spiral channels. The suboval aperture is quite large. The posterior angle is obtuse. The thin outer lip is denticulate. The incised spiral channels appear as a chain of squarish areolations within, by transmitted light. The columella is moderately strong, somewhat twisted and slightly reflected with a subobsolete oblique fold near its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a very feeble callus.Dall & Bartsch (1906), Notes on Japanese, Indopacific, and American Pyramidellidae; Proceedings of the United States National Museum, 30(1452): 321-369, 10 pls.

The team is a member of the Patriot League of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. In 1985, the team reached to the national championship, losing to UCLA after eight overtimes.  Early history (1949‚Äì1968)  American University kicked off its varsity men's soccer program in 1949 as a member of the Mason-Dixon Conference in the NCAA College Division, the predecessor to Division II, but suspended it after just two seasons when a study by the Board of Trustees decided the school was too small to field a competitive team (the Eagles had compiled a 2‚Äì10 overall record) and the sport was too expensive to fund. It was revived, however, in 1954, with the hopes of replacing the role of the football program (ended by the Board in 1942) as the centerpiece of homecoming weekend and a source of school spirit. The program had achieved a modicum of success under six different head coaches by the mid-1960s when AU made the decision to move to Division I (the then-University Division), announcing in the spring of 1966 that it would join the Middle Atlantic Conference (MAC), the largest in the nation, for the 1966‚Äì67 collegiate year. That left no time, however, to schedule enough conference opponents to be eligible for the MAC's soccer championship, so the Eagles continued to compete in the Mason-Dixon Conference in soccer for one additional season. Since the other schools in the MAC's University Division did not operate as their own division until the 1969 season, this effectively enabled AU to use the 1966‚Äì1968 seasons to transition to Division I. The Eagles compiled a 2‚Äì14 record against other D1 schools over that time under the tenure of tennis coach Larry Nyce for two seasons, then Ned Boehm.  Move to Division I (1969‚Äì1971)  The 1969 season marked the beginning of MAC University Division soccer and AU's real foray into Division 1 under Coach Boehm, with the team compiling a 3-4-1 record against D1 opponents, going 1-3-1 in conference play against the rest of the MAC University Division's eastern section (tying Hofstra at home, beating La Salle on the road, then losing to West Chester at home as well as road games against St. Joseph's and Temple). Junior defender Jeff Wood and freshman forward Fahad Al-Rajaan were named to the all-MAC eastern team, while senior defender Chris Kalavritinos and junior goalkeeper Ira Kamens were named to the NCAA's all-South region team. In 1970, Boehm left the athletics department to accept a job as assistant director of admissions. His replacement was Sidwell Friends head coach Dick Stimson, who had won three high school championships in eight seasons there, including going undefeated in 1967. The 1970 Eagles would have compiled a 3-5-1 record against D1 competition but for a bizarre game at Reeves Field against new conference foe Drexel. It was a wild affair, with the Eagles blowing a 2‚Äì1 lead after trailing 0‚Äì1, Al-Rajaan scoring a hat trick on AU's first 3 goals, and junior Jim Tate tying the game 5‚Äì5 (after he had previously tied it at 4 on a goal off a corner kick) with just seconds remaining in regulation. With two minutes to play in the second overtime period, Drexel head coach Don Yonker was ejected from the game for assisting one of his players whose leg had cramped despite the referee not stopping play. But he refused to leave the field, so the game was called a forfeit. AU soccer's coaching carousel would continue in 1971 with Stimson's departure. But Boehm helped recruit Scottish-Canadian John Kerr, Sr., a member of the Canadian Men's National Team and professional player in the NASL (at the time for the Washington Darts), who had coached Georgetown's freshman team to an undefeated record in 1970. The student-athletes immediately responded to Kerr's experience as a professional international soccer player who was willing to practice with them and share techniques. Most importantly to the Eagles, Kerr nurtured the sudden interest in soccer by sophomore Kurt Kuykendall, who had been cut from the varsity basketball team after his freshman year and threw himself into learning how to play goalkeeper‚Äîa position that was open on the team after the graduation of Kamens. Though the 1971 Eagles‚Äô 2-5-1 record against D1 opponents appeared to be a step backward, the team's play was much improved qualitatively. Four Eagles were named to the all-MAC eastern team: Al-Rajaan, junior defender Kenny Davidson, junior midfielder Mark Lowenstein, and sophomore forward Alan Ross. (Kuykendall, Lowenstein and Ross would all play professionally in the NASL for the new Washington Diplomats after graduating.) However, the Darts moved to south Florida over the winter (where they would eventually be reborn as one of the key franchises of the NASL's glory years, the Fort Lauderdale Strikers) and Kerr's contract was sold to the New York Cosmos. Another coaching change was yet again in the works for the Eagles, but few could have guessed the 20 years of stability and unprecedented success (for AU athletics) that coach would bring.  The Mehlert era begins (1972‚Äì1973)  Pete Mehlert was born in Shanghai; raised in Hong Kong, London and Bethesda; and played soccer at Walter Johnson High School and Boston University, where the aggressive, combative‚Äîif undersized‚Äîmidfielder was twice named to the All-New England region team. A year after graduating BU, he was hired as American's first full-time soccer coach. Inheriting four all-conference players, in 1972 he guided the Eagles to a 3‚Äì5 record against D1 competition, including two wins against conference foes (including the program's first-ever against 1961 NCAA champion West Chester thanks to a shutout by Kuykendall and a dramatic header by freshman forward Mark McDonough.) Senior forward Brian O‚ÄôNeill, Kuykendall and Lowenstein all were named to the all-MAC University Division east team, with Lowenstein being named eastern section MVP. The Eagles continued to improve in 1973 with their first-ever winning season against D1 competition and a .500 record against MAC conference foes, including road wins in Philadelphia against La Salle and Drexel. Al-Rajaan (as a fifth-year senior ‚Äì he sat out the 1972 season for personal reasons), Kuykendall and Ross were again named to the MAC University Division eastern all-star team. In a move that would foreshadow his trademark penchant for lining up the best opposition in the country, Mehlert scheduled a year-end match under the lights at Washington & Lee High School in Arlington against St. Louis University‚Äîwho had won the NCAA championship nine of the previous 14 seasons and would win their tenth a few weeks later. Despite outshooting the Eagles 26-8, the Billikens only won 1‚Äì0 thanks to Kuykendall's 22 saves. In December he would be named an honorable mention all-American. The capstone to Kuykendall's collegiate career would occur in January 1974, when the NASL expansion Washington Diplomats drafted him with the #2 overall pick. While the Mehlert era was off to a great start, big changes loomed: In 1973, the NCAA created its current three division structure. For 1974, 12 of the 13 MAC University Division schools (all except Gettysburg) decided to form their own new multi-sport Division I conference‚Äîthe East Coast Conference‚Äîrather than continue in the MAC's multi- division structure. (The rest of the MAC would shortly move to Division III status.) How would AU adjust? And how would Mehlert replace the best player in school history to date in the critical position guarding the nets?  New conference, familiar foes (1974‚Äì1976)  Reeves Field during an American game against Lehigh in September 2019. The East Coast Conference (ECC) retained the MAC University Division's east-west sectional alignment‚Äîwhich reflected more of a big market-small market division than geography, with West Chester moving into the West Division (along with Bucknell, Delaware, Lafayette, Lehigh and Rider) and AU remaining in the East with the four Philadelphia schools (Drexel, La Salle, St. Joseph's and Temple) and Long Island-based Hofstra. But not wanting to lose such a high-quality regular opponent, Mehlert would continue to schedule the Golden Rams until they would eventually leave Division I in 1982. The 1974 season would also see AU's first game against the University of Maryland, a 2‚Äì3 loss in College Park, beginning another top- notch annual local rivalry. Unhappy with his three candidates to succeed Kuykendall at goalkeeper, Mehlert asked senior midfielder John Rachlin to try the position after watching him ‚Äúfooling around‚Äù in the nets during practice. Despite not having ever previously played the position in a competitive game, Rachlin would help the Eagles attain a 3-4-2 record against D1 opponents and a 1-2-2 mark in the ECC East, beating West Chester at home and earning shutouts against Hofstra on the road in his first win and Georgetown at home to end the season. After a shaky start that included AU's first loss to local rival George Washington in 6 years, the selfless Rachlin earned enthusiastic support from his teammates and praise from Mehlert. There are many differences in the rules of college soccer compared to the professional and international game, including the ability of substituted players to re-enter the game (with certain limitations) and a game-clock that counts in the wrong direction (backwards). Another critical difference is the treatment of regular-season ties, which the NCAA over the decades has tried various ways to resolve, using overtime periods of different durations under both timed and sudden-death rules. If college soccer was played like soccer in the rest of the world, the Eagles would have been undefeated against D1 opponents in 1975, but officially were 5-2-3 (thanks to a 1-2-3 record in their 6 overtime games, including a heartbreaking own-goal loss to West Chester on the road and a home overtime loss to Temple‚Äîthe closest the Eagles had come to beating the traditional- powerhouse Owls in 10 tries). They also had their first-ever winning record in conference play, going 3-1-1 including their first win over St. Joseph's (they were previously 0-7-2 against the Hawks). Junior goalkeeper Jack Cassell (a name very familiar to the AU community) brought stability in the nets for the Eagles, recording four shutouts against D1 opponents. In recognition of their most-successful season to date, four Eagles were named to the all-ECC East Division team: defender Ted Nussdorfer (junior), midfielder Mbakiso ‚ÄúReggie‚Äù Dambe (senior), and forwards Alex Chambers (senior) and Aidan Cunningham (freshman). The 1976 season would see the Eagles continue to play very competitive soccer under Coach Mehlert, going 6-4-1 against D1 opponents and 2‚Äì3 in the ECC East. The schedule would see AU compete in its first-ever regular-season tournament, the Old Dominion Classic hosted by ODU, in which the Eagles tied Princeton 1-1 in their first game against an Ivy League foe, and defeated East Carolina in overtime 7-3 thanks to a 4-goal explosion in less than 12 minutes by senior forward Chuck Banknell, giving him an AU D1-record 5-goal performance. Senior goalkeeper Cassell suffered a separated shoulder in an early-season loss to La Salle, opening the door for sophomore transfer Tony Vecchione (from Montclair State) to post two shutouts in a 3-day period. Vecchione would share the position with Cassell after his return from injury and go on to become one of the great AU ‚Äòkeepers and later coach local rival George Washington. As a defunct conference, the ECC‚Äôs archival records are difficult to find for verification, but AU records say that at least freshman midfielder Luis Calderon was named to the all-ECC's East Division team.  Welcome to the post-season! (1977‚Äì1979)  The 1977 season would be a streaky one, but ultimately prove the most successful in AU history to date. The Eagles won their first division championship thanks to two 1-0 overtime victories over Temple; one at Reeves Field, the other a playoff game in Philadelphia that served as the tie-breaker for the two schools‚Äô identical 4-1 conference records. Making the accomplishment all the more impressive was the Eagles‚Äô previous 0‚Äì11 record against the Owls since turning D1 in 1966. Both winning goals were scored by senior transfer Rolf Neitzel‚Äîwho had previously attended Montgomery College and the Naval Academy and would emerge as AU's most dangerous scoring threat‚Äîon crosses by the Eagles‚Äô outstanding midfielders: sophomore Calderon (in the regular-season game) and junior Cunningham (in the playoff game). Other highlights included: a return to Old Dominion's tournament, where AU lost to Long Island University before ending their early 0‚Äì3 start against D1 opponents with a victory against Virginia Military Institute; the beginning of another new local rivalry, this time against 1971 and 1974 NCAA champion Howard University (the Eagles lost to the Bison 1‚Äì3 at home); 5 shutouts against D1 opponents by junior goalkeeper Vecchione; and a 5-game midseason winning streak. To end the season, the Eagles would face West Division champion West Chester in the ECC title game. The 1‚Äì2 home loss to the Golden Rams was disappointing considering the Eagles had beaten them on the road 3-0 earlier in the season, but Neitzel suffered a head injury and West Chester was the hungrier team and outplayed AU. Neitzel, Cunningham and senior defender Garn Anderson were all named to the all-ECC East Division team as AU finished with an 8‚Äì8 record against D1 opponents. But a sense of unfinished business from 1977 would fuel Mehlert and the returning Eagles to greater heights over the next two seasons. It would be a year of firsts for the Eagles in 1978: the beginning of another local rivalry with new Division I entrant George Mason University (setting the tone for that intense rivalry with a 0‚Äì0 tie against the Patriots in Fairfax), going undefeated at home against D1 competition (6‚Äì0), and AU's first-ever NCAA tournament appearance in any team sport thanks to an at-large bid‚Äîdespite not winning the ECC title but posting an 8-4-1 regular-season record against D1 opponents. The modest freshman forward Kevin Barth picked up where Neitzel left off the previous season, with his head emerging as the most dangerous part of the Eagles‚Äô offense. Vecchione had 6 shutouts against D1 competition, including three straight to end the regular season. The Eagles avenged their 1977 ECC title-game loss with a 3‚Äì0 victory over West Chester at Reeves Field, but their inability to beat Philadelphia nemeses Temple and St. Joseph's on the road left them with a 3‚Äì2 conference record and out of contention for the conference championship. The NCAA tournament selection committee, however, would deem them worthy of a chance for a national title. But the Eagles seemed outmatched and a bit overwhelmed on the road against undefeated Clemson, losing 0‚Äì4. (Clemson would finally fall in the College Cup, losing to national champion San Francisco in the semifinals). Junior Calderon and freshman Barth were named to the all-ECC East Division team (and others may have as well; ECC records are difficult to locate). The experience of playing in the NCAA tournament would help shape an even-more successful season in 1979, but the Eagles would first have to replace the graduating Vecchione in the nets. Returning every starter other than Vecchione from its first-ever NCAA tournament team, the Eagles had high hopes for 1979. But after three games against D1 opponents AU was only 0-2-1, falling at home to Navy in overtime (kicking off yet another new annual regional rivalry), tying the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill at a tournament hosted by Division III Lynchburg College, and losing at home to Maryland. That would be last Eagles loss in the regular season, however, as they went 10-0-2 the rest of the way including home ties against Temple and Howard, compiling a 4-0-1 record to tie the Owls for first place in the East Division. Mehlert started platooning junior college transfer Bill Ruvo (Burlington County, NJ) in goal with returning junior ‚Äòkeeper Eric Berezin after Ruvo recovered from a fractured ankle suffered the second day of practice, and Ruvo would claim the position after Berezin was lost to a broken wrist 5 games into the streak. Against D1 teams, Ruvo would finish 10-2-1 with 7 shutouts, including 5 in a row. American would take the ECC East crown from Temple on penalty kicks after a 0‚Äì0 tie in Philadelphia, and crushed Rider 3-0 in the conference title game at Reeves Field. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, AU prevailed 1-0 in Charlottesville in their first-ever match against the University of Virginia, as freshman forward Mark DeBlois scored his team-leading 12th goal on a free kick from sophomore midfielder Billy Hylton. Unfortunately for the Eagles, as in 1978, Clemson was lurking in the next round‚Äîthis time the quarterfinals. Thought they played a much closer match than the previous year, AU fell 0‚Äì1 to the Tigers on the road. DeBlois, senior midfielders Calderon and Doug Dugan, and junior midfielder Eduardo Lopez (a transfer from William & Mary where he was a two-time NCAA all-South region team selection) were all named to the all-ECC East Division team. To this day, 1979 (12-3-4 overall against D1 teams) stands as one of the three most-successful seasons in AU soccer history. But the Eagles would graduate 7 seniors (Calderon would be the 75th overall pick in the 1980 NASL Draft by the New England Tea Men, who shortly moved to Jacksonville), including key reserve defender Keith Tabatznik, who would go on to become the head coach at Georgetown (joining Vecchione as the second Eagle alum recruited to coach a local rival), posing the need for recruiting and rebuilding before they could continue their ascent to the heights of college soccer.  AU alumni in the pros and international soccer  Ten AU alumni so far have appeared in a Major League Soccer (MLS) or North American Soccer League (NASL) game: * Defender Avery John played in 70 games from 2004‚Äì2009 with the New England Revolution and DC United. (He also played in 75 games from 1999‚Äì2003 with Irish first division clubs Bohemians, Shelbourne and Longford Town.) * Midfielder Antonio Otero played in 25 games with DC United from 1999‚Äì2000. He was a Generation Adidas amateur signee with MLS in 1998 and assigned to DC United. * Defender John Diffley played in only 19 games from 1996‚Äì1997 with the Tampa Bay Mutiny and Sporting Kansas City at the end of his career because there was no US first division league after he graduated in 1989 until MLS was launched in 1996. Tampa Bay selected him with the 27th pick in the MLS inaugural player draft. * Midfielder David Nakhid played in 18 games in 1998 with the Revolution. (He also played in 42 games with former Belgian first division club KSV Waragem from 1990‚Äì1992, 41 games with Swiss first division club Grasshoppers from 1992‚Äì1994, and with Greek first division club PAOK FC in the 1994‚Äì1995 season and Swedish first division club Malmo FF in the 1998‚Äì1999 season.) As a 1987 graduate, his playing career was also impacted by the lack of a top-level US pro league from 1985‚Äì1995. * Goalkeeper Kurt Kuykendall played in 15 games from 1974‚Äì1976 with the Washington Diplomats and New York Cosmos. The Diplomats selected him with the 2nd pick in the 1974 draft. * Midfielder Mark Lowenstein played in 3 games with the Diplomats in 1976. * Midfielder Shawn Kuykendall played in 2 games with DC United in 2005. He was selected by DC United with the 96th pick in the 2005 draft. * Midfielder Sal Caccavale played in 1 game with the New York Red Bulls in 2007. He was selected by the Red Bulls with the 71st pick in the 2007 draft. * Defender Chris Brown played in 1 game with FC Dallas in 1998. * Forward Alan Ross played in 1 game with the Diplomats in 1975. Although they never played in a US first division game, another four AU alumni were selected in the NASL and MLS drafts: defender Bobby Brennan was the 42nd pick in the 2002 draft by DC United, goalkeeper Michael Behonick was the 51st pick in the 2003 draft by DC United, goalkeeper Billy Knutsen was the 74th pick in the 2014 draft by the San Jose Earthquakes, and midfielder Luis Calderon was the 75th pick of the 1980 draft by the New England Tea Men. Although undrafted, forward Scott Pearson dressed for a 1999 game for an injury-depleted DC United team but did not play. Forward Peter Philipakos also played in the Greek first division with club Olympiacos FC in the 2004‚Äì2005 and 2008‚Äì2009 seasons. Some of the Eagles‚Äô finest alumni graduated in the mid-1980s, just as the NASL was in its death throws. During the years 1985‚Äì1995 when there was no first division US league, Diffley, Nakhid, Calderon and another nine AU alumni played in the various top-level leagues that were predecessors to the US second-division A-League, including: forward Michael Brady, midfielder Adrian Gaitan, forward Scott Snyder, goalkeeper Stephen Pfeil, defender Keith Trehy, midfielder Richie Burke, midfielder Fernando Iturbe, defender Troy Regis, and forward Abdulwhab Al-Khaldi. Undoubtedly some of them would have played at the first-division level in the US if one existed at the time. Two AU alumni have represented the US in senior international soccer: Diffley, who earned 7 caps in 1988 (and was first alternate for the US Olympic Team that year); and Brady (who was born in Chicago to Irish parents before moving to England as an infant) who earned 3 from 1984‚Äì1985. John earned 65 caps for Trinidad and Tobago; David Nakhid earned 35 for the Soca Warriors.

Its length measures 4.4 mm. The protoconch is small with two whorls which increase extremely rapidly in size and are obliquely placed. The six whorls of the teleoconch are very strongly shouldered, marked by three very strong lamellar spiral keels on the first and second and four on the succeeding whorls between the sutures. The posterior keel marks the limit of the broad, sloping shoulder and is much the strongest. It is also placed a little farther apart from the next spiral keel than that is from its anterior neighbor. The base of the body whorl is well rounded. The shell is ornamented by eight spiral ridges, which are less elevated and much more closely and regularly spaced than those between the sutures. The peripheral groove is about equal in width to the one anterior to the posterior keel. The entire shell is marked by fine, sublamellar, regularly spaced, retractive axial ribs, which render the spiral keels somewhat crenulated at their meeting points and break the spaces between them into small squares or oblongs. These riblets extend from the sutures to the small umbilicus. The aperture is subovate. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, somewhat wavy, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is moderately stout, somewhat curved and strongly revolute, having an oblique fold near its insertion which is barely visible when the aperture is viewed squared.

The seven whorls of the teleoconch are very slightly rounded, separated by deeply channeled sutures. In this species the axial ribs exceed the four spiral keels in strength, their junction forming elongated tubercles the long axis of which coincides with the spiral keels. The axial ribs, of which there are 16 upon all of the turns, slant decidedly backward near the aperture. They are rather distantly spaced and the spaces enclosed between them and the spiral keels are deep oblong pits, the long axis of which coincides with the spiral sculpture. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a deep, wide channel across which the ribs extend feebly to the first subperipheral keel. The base of the shell is rather long and well rounded, marked by seven rather narrow, slender spiral keels which successively decrease in strength from the periphery to the umbilical area, the anterior ones being only faintly indicated. The spaces which separate the keels are about twice as wide as the keels and are crossed by many slender raised axial threads. The aperture is oval. The outer lip is rather thick.

It can be traced back to the officially-run weaving factory ‚ÄúJin Bureau‚Äù (in Chinese Èî¶ÁΩ≤), which produced the brocade only for the royal family. It was not until the late Qing dynasty that the development of Nanjing cloud-pattern brocade entered its period of full bloom; then the products were sold to the common citizens. Nanjing brocades are famous for their exquisite technology, elegant patterns and smooth texture. The patterns is various and as beautiful as the cloud in the sky; therefore its name ‚ÄúYunjin‚Äù comes. In 2009, Nanjing brocade was selected into candidate programmes of the oral and intangible heritage of humans at UNESCO.  History  The history of Nanjing Yunjin can be traced back to the three kingdoms period (220-280). In a war, which broke out at the end of the East Jin Dynasty (317-420), General Liu Yu defeated the Xi'an-based Later Qin kingdom (384-417). The victory brought all the craftsmen in Xi'an back to Jiankang, now Nanjing City, among whom brocade-weavers were a dominant force. The brocade weavers were top craftsmen nationwide and had learned many skills from minority ethnic groups. The East Jin government had set up a special brocade office in Nanjing to manage the production of the brocade, which represented the formal establishment of Nanjing brocade. In the Qing Dynasty, \\"Jiangning Weaving Department\\" was established in Nanjing. When Nanjing Yunjin weaving peaked, it had more than 30,000 looms and nearly 300,000 people made a living in these fields. It was Nanjing's largest handicraft industry at that time. After 1949, the Chinese government successively invested tens of millions of yuan for the restoration and protection of Yunjin, but Yunjin still faces the situation of no successor.  Features  Among all kinds of silk fabrics, only Nanjing Yunjin Brocade still maintains traditional features and unique skills. It is still made by traditional Chinese large flower floor machines. Nanjing yunjin brocade is regarded as one of the best forms of silk. It is famous for its cloud-like colours and intricate patterns. Nanjing yunjin brocades are famous for their exquisite technology, elegant patterns and smooth texture.

Frena, 839 F.Supp. 1552 (1993)http://floridalawfirm.com/iplaw/playb2.html was a copyright infringement case decided by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, holding that the unauthorized use of photographs infringed on copyright; using magazine's trademark to identify bulletin board files was trademark infringement; and deleting magazine's trademark from photographs and inserting advertisement was unfair competition.839 F.Supp. 1552 Facts Defendant George Frena operated a subscription computer bulletin board service, Techs Warehouse BBS (\\"BBS\\"). Photographs copyrighted by Plaintiff Playboy Entertainment, Inc.'s (\\"PEI\\") were uploaded onto BBS without permission. Subscribers of BBS were allowed to browse and download the photographs in high quality computerized images which were then stored on the subscriber's home computer. One hundred and seventy of the images that were available on BBS were copies of photographs taken from PEI's copyrighted materials. Defendant Frena claimed to never have uploaded any of PEI's photographs onto BBS and that subscribers to BBS uploaded the photographs. Defendant Frena states that as soon as he was served with a summons and made aware of this matter, he removed the photographs and has since that time monitored BBS to prevent additional photographs of PEI from being uploaded. Copyright Infringement Playboy Entertainment, Inc. (\\"PEI\\") alleged that George Frena (\\"Frena\\"), the operator of Techs Warehouse BBS (\\"BBS\\"), a subscription based computer bulletin board service, was liable for copyright infringement when BBS' subscribers distributed unauthorized copies of PEI's copyrighted photographs on the bulletin board. =The Copyright Act of 1976= The Copyright Act of 1976http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102 gives copyright owners control over most, if not all, activities of conceivable commercial value. The statute provides that the owner of a copyright has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: # to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; # to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; # to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending; (the right to sell) # in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly; # in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and # in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.17 U.S.C. ¬ß 106 =Establishing Copyright Infringement= To establish copyright infringement, PEI must show (1) Ownership of the copyright and (2) Copying by Defendant Frena occurred.Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991); Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. v. Assoc. Telephone Directory Publishers, 756 F.2d 801 (1985) =Ownership of Copyright= The Court held that PEI owned the copyright to the photographs in question. The photographs were published in Playboy issues which PEI held a copyright registration certificate. The certificate constitutes prima facie evidence in favor of PEI. Once prima facie established by PEI, the burden then shifts to Defendant Frena to counter this evidence. However, Defendant Frena failed to rebut the appropriate inference of validity. =Copying by Defendant= The Court stated that even without direct evidence, copying may be inferentially proven by showing that Defendant Frena had access to the allegedly infringed work, that the allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to the copyrighted work, and that one of the rights statutorily guaranteed to copyright owners is implicated by Frena's actions. =Intent of Defendant= Intent or knowledge is not an element of infringement. Even an innocent infringer is liable for infringement. However, intent is significant in determining statutory damages and remedies. =Conclusion= Public distribution of a copyrighted work is a right reserved to the copyright owner, and seizure of that right constitutes infringement. The Court held that PEI's right to distribute copies to the public was violated by Defendant Frena. Exclusive rights in copyrighted works17 U.S.C. ¬ß 106 grants PEI the exclusive rights to sell, give away, rent or lend any material embodiment of his work. In addressing Defendant Frena's argument that he did not make the unauthorized copies but that subscribers to BBS uploaded the photographs, the Court ruled that it did not matter that Frena was not the originator of the authorized copies. Frena supplied a product containing unauthorized copies. Therefore, he violated PEI's exclusive rights. Display Rights The Court also held that Defendant Frena had infringed upon the display rights of PEI. The concept of \\"display\\" covers the projection of an image on a screen or other surface by any method and the transmission of an image by electronic or other means. The display right precludes unauthorized transmission of the display from one place to another, for example, by a computer system. In order for copyright infringement to occur, the display must be public. A public display is a display at a place open to the public or where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of family and its social acquaintances are gathered. A place is open to the public in this sense even if access is limited to paying customers. In the case at bar, Defendant Frena's transmitted the copyrighted material electronically and displayed them public to its subscriber. BBS subscribers consisted of a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of family and its social acquaintances.

Its purpose is to alleviate summer traffic congestion and to improve both emergency response and evacuation time. Long a topic of study and debate, the bridge could be built in the 2020s. History Plans for a bridge that connected Currituck County's mainland and outer banks has been on the drawing board since the 1970s. However, because of the high cost of project, it remained unfunded for decades. In 2008, the bridge was picked up by the North Carolina Turnpike Authority as a possible new toll route and work began on the environmental impact for the area. On January 19, 2012, The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was released by the N.C. Turnpike Authority. It recommended the preferred alternative for the project, which involves construction of the bridge, as well as limited improvements to existing NC 12 and US 158, estimated to cost around $660 million. With final approval expected in the spring, construction would begin in late 2012, opening to traffic in 2017. The project would include: :* A straight two-lane bridge connecting the mainland with a northern landing on the Outer Banks; :* Toll plaza and interchange with US 158, with two-lane bridge over Maple Swamp; :* Reversing the center turn lane on US 158; :* Roundabout installed on NC 12, at the bridge landing and Currituck Clubhouse Drive; and :* Widen NC 12 to four-lane in certain areas, with left turn lanes at intersections that remain two-lane. In June, 2012, NCDOT recommended not to fund the project through 2013, anticipating possible lawsuits. As a result, the North Carolina General Assembly provided no funds, delaying the project. In December, 2014, NCDOT included the bridge in its final draft in the 10-year State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). With an estimated cost of $410 million, with the state contributing $173 million, it will pay-off the remainder by toll revenue. Construction for the bridge was programmed to begin in 2019 and be completed in four years. Project planning and implementation of the Mid-Currituck Bridge was placed on hold in 2013 while NCDOT reviewed state, regional and local transportation improvement funding priorities using the Strategic Mobility Formula. The project was then approved for inclusion in the 2016-2025 State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). An amendment to the STIP called for NCDOT to start the dedication of state transportation funding in fiscal year 2017 (which starts July 2016) that will be used for bridge construction.NCDOT.\\"Mid-Currituck Bridge: Project Overview and Purpose\\" , NCDOT, Retrieved 13 May 2016. Reports in summer 2018 indicated that the bridge could open in 2024, but no contract for construction has yet been awarded. Officially there is no date for completion. In March 2019 the Federal Highway Administration approved the project.

It is present from Madagascar. Overview The genus was described by Jens Gunter Rohwer & Hans Georg Richter in Jahrbuch f√ºr Botanische Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie 109 (1): 74 in 1987. The type species is Aspidostemon perrieri (Danguy) Rohwer. The number of collections available is not large. The identification was done at the Missouri Botanical Garden.  Description  They are shrubs or trees up to 25 m high, hermaphrodites. The leaves are entire, elliptical or narrowly elliptical. The fruit is a berry-like drupe dispersed mostly by birds. Aspidostemon species are no exception among the Lauraceae; they are trees with small flowers, hard to detect and collect and often overlooked or ignored when plants easier to collect or with showier flowers are at hand. Aspidostemon is characterized by its opposite leaves, flowers with three or six stamens (compared to 9 in Cryptocarya), and a fruit which is completely enclosed in the enlarged hypanthium with persistent floral parts attached to the top of the fruit. When the genus was described by Rohwer & Richter in 1987, they recognized 11 species, but today 28 species are accepted. Some species are endangered or almost extinct. Based on a combination of wood anatomical, vegetative, and floral characters, noted by such earlier botanists as Kostermans in 1957, the species of genus Aspidostemon were placed formerly as belonging to subgenera Hexanthera and Trianthera of Cryptocarya. Ecology Aspidostemon species have the large trees characteristic of rainforest in montane laurel forest habitats in Madagascar and nearby islands and restricted to this region. They belong to an ancient isolated Gondwanian element of Laurales. A great number of species are in danger of extinction due to overexploitation as timber extraction and loss of habitat. They are leafy canopy trees with erect or spreading branches. They grow to heights of up to 25 m, or some species to 40 m. Their stout trunks are up to 1 m in diameter. The genus is easily recognizable by its bark which is soft and cheese-like. The thick, leathery leaves are dark green. The leaves are glossy laurel type. The leaves of Aspidostemon species are not infrequently acuminate, with an acumen folded into a short tube. On opening a few of these inrolled apices, egg cases similar to those found in leaf domatia are found; epiphyllous hepatics were also found. These inrolled apices apparently function as domatia and shelter mites that clean the leaves. The fruit is an important food source for birds, usually from specialized genera. Birds eat the whole fruit and regurgitate or defecate the seeds intact, expanding the seeds in the best conditions for germination (ornitochory). In some species, seed dispersal is carried out by mammals.

The screenplay is the feature-length debut for co-writers Bruce Wood and Scott Poiley. The film stars Kelen Coleman, Kevin Alejandro, Louise Fletcher, Rus Blackwell, Hank Stone, J Larose, Amy LoCiero and Christina Bach. The story revolves around Lily Morel (Kelen Coleman) trying to recover from her sister‚Äôs tragic death. She is haunted by a murdered woman and ends up on a mission to solve her mysterious death. One thing leads to another and Lily finds herself at the mercy of a sociopath dubbed \\"Geppetto\\". Cassadaga had its World Premiere at the Mann Chinese Theater 6 in Hollywood, California on October 22, 2011 as part of the Screamfest LA Film Festival.  Plot  The film opens with a young boy wearing a dress while playing with a doll. He's discovered by his mother, who angrily destroys both the dress and the doll in front of him, bringing the boy to tears. This so traumatizes the boy that he castrates himself. Cassadaga follows Lily (Kelen Coleman), a deaf woman who has traveled to Cassadaga, Florida in order to teach and grieve for her dead sister Michele (Sarah Sculco). She's also attending Cassadaga University on a scholarship provided by Claire (Louise Fletcher), who also allows her to live on her property with herself and her grandson Thomas (Lucas Beck). While staying in the town she begins dating Mike (Kevin Alejandro), the divorced father of one of her students Haley (Rachel Durose). Lily ends up visiting a psychic (Avis-Marie Barnes) after one of Mike's friends suggests it, during which time she makes a brief connection with her sister's spirit but also receives a warning about a female spirit that has attached itself to her. Soon after Lily experiences a series of terrifying visions. Meanwhile, the young boy, now an adult, is shown to be a grisly murderer that turns his corpses into marionettes. Lily then ends up meeting Christian (Rus Blackwell), while he's inspecting a greenhouse he built for Claire, during which time he informs her that Jennifer (Amy LoCicero), the last person who won Claire's scholarship, ended up going missing. The police suspected that Thomas had killed her, but were unable to find enough evidence to arrest him. Correctly suspecting that Jennifer is haunting her, Lily convinces Mike to help her search for clues. Together they discover evidence that shows that Thomas was stalking Jennifer prior to her disappearance and also learn that Lily is unable to leave town until she puts Jennifer's spirit to rest. Mike ends up leaving Lily because his ex-wife is using Lily's strange behaviors (due to the haunting) as a way to gain full custody of Haley. This saddens and infuriates Lily, who knocks over paintings she'd been making of her visions. Through this action she realizes that her visions have been of Claire's greenhouse. She investigates the building and finds both drugs and Jennifer's corpse. Lily is attacked by Thomas, who is promptly arrested by police arriving on the scene. While he is arrested for both the drugs and Jennifer's murder, the police discover that Thomas is not the killer. One officer, Officer Hall (Lucius Baston), goes to interview Christian, who he quickly deduces is the true murderer. Christian murders the officer and abducts Lily, who he plans on turning into his next marionette. Lily initially manages to escape her captor and flee using a car, but is distracted and causes a car crash. As Christian approaches Lily, Jennifer appears in front of Christian, giving Lily the opportunity to attack him with a pair of scissors he dropped. This causes her to see a vision of her sister, signifying that she has come to terms with Michele's death.

While writing, Wood had the basic outline of the character ‚ÄúGeppetto‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt until he was at the gym and thought up the shocking opening sequence that he discovered why ‚ÄúGeppetto‚Äù was the way he was; ‚Äúin that moment I saw him as a child, I knew this character and what motivated him.‚Äù Lee Grimes was in charge of the special effects make-up. Director Anthony DiBlasi chose this script because he wanted to do a horror film where ‚Äúthere were characters in that I thought people could relate to and feel bad for when things happen to them‚Äù. Oscar winner Louise Fletcher wanted to be in the movie because both her parents were deaf, just like the main character Lily. The actor playing ‚ÄúGeppetto‚Äù was kept a complete secret until opening night. Reception Critical reception for Cassadaga has been negative and the film holds a rating of 18% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 11 reviews. The film received praise from outlets like Dread Central and ShockYa, the former of which wrote that \\"while not a perfect film, the flick does have a freshly unique voice and is one which more than likely genre fans will want to sink their teeth into.\\" In contrast, media outlets like Variety and The New York Times panned the film. The Village Voice and Bloody Disgusting also panned Cassadaga, with Bloody Disgusting writing that \\"Cassadaga has multiple points of potential, however, we end up with a story that is like a puppet with multiple puppeteers that simply cannot work in sync with each other.\\" References External links * Category:2011 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American serial killer films Category:2011 horror films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American slasher films ","title":"Cassadaga (film)"},{"id":"33656311","text":"Bill Black Hollywood, California 2015 Bill Black is a musician who also casts and directs voice actors and performs sound effects design.

It is on the west side of Promina mountain, on the edge of the high cliffs of river Krka, south of Miljacka Falls, where the Krka National Park begins, by the eponymous village. Neƒçven originates, according to the 19th-century historian Grgur Urliƒá-Ivanoviƒá who first described the remains,Dovr≈°ena jo≈° jedna faza arheolo≈°kih iskopavanja na Neƒçvenu at Krka National Park official site in the 9th century, and was named, according to legend, after a beautiful girl from the area that rejected all violence from the Bribirers and eventually poisoned herself to avoid capture. The story probably symbolizes the hostility between the ≈†ubiƒá's Tro≈°enj-ƒåuƒçevo and Nelipiƒá's Neƒçven.Journal of The Center for Ottoman Studies, Ankara University. P138 Sayi 25/Bahar 2009. The fort and its associated yard cover a square kilometer (0.4 sq mi). It used to be surrounded by high walls made of small, poorly assembled stones combined with lime. The northeast courtyard wall was separated by a deep moat and perhaps a moving (lifting) bridge from the remains of the fortress. The walls were over a meter thick. The steep southern walls reached a height of up to and consisted of five floors. The northern side, where the five-storey ancient square tower stands, is now filled with rubble. On the other side of Krka, opposite from Neƒçven, are remnants of another old Croatian city, Tro≈°enj (ƒåuƒçevo). Those cities were previously connected by a bridge (which was destroyed in 1647 during the war between Don Stjepan Soriƒá and Kraji≈°nici) that connected central Dalmatia with Bukovica and Ravni Kotari. The bridge was supervised and travellers who passed the border between ≈†ubiƒá's and Nelipiƒá's properties were charged a toll. The First Lords of Neƒçven-Nelipiƒá were at the height of their power after the collapse of Mladen ≈†ubiƒá II (1322 AD) when they were named as the major force in the Southern Croatian region by Prince Nelipac. The Turks ruled Neƒçven from 1522 to 1678 or 1686, apart from a period between 1648 and 1670 during which it was given to Venetian vassals ≈†ibenik and Trogir, and burned down at the orders of Leonardo Foscolo,Medieval Fortresses at Drni≈° tourist board site using the established constructions they found and the mighty wooden bridge over the river Krka. In their time there lived: the Dizdars, the Aghas, the Begs and the Kadijas), which showed a great deal how important the fort and the city was because it was in effect the seat for administrative and judicial power in that area for that time. By the end of the 18th century, the fortress lost its strategic importance, and it was abandoned and the surrounding villages depopulated.

In 1918 he was galloping horses at a racetrack in Saskatchewan where he would ride his first winner before leaving to compete in Spokane, Washington. He rode until around 1923 and after learning the art of horse conditioning for racing, in the latter part of the decade embarked on a training career. His first client was James Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League, for whom he would win the 1938 Metropolitan Handicap with Danger Point.New York Times - May 15, 1938 In 1928, Hayward returned temporarily to Canada where he won the Whittier Park Handicap.Saskatoon Star- Phoenix - May 5, 1953 In 1940, Hayward trained a horse in California for Canadian-born actor Victor JoryLos Angeles Times - January 26, 1940 and later was hired by Muriel Vanderbilt Adams for whom he trained Miche.Los Angeles Times - July 16, 1950 =1953 Derby Trial and Kentucky Derby= Eddie Hayward moved to the East Coast of the United States in late 1952 to take over as head trainer for Harry Gugenheim's Cain Hoy Stable. Besides Dark Star, among the other Cain Hoy horses Hayward would train were Battle Morn and Armageddon. In 1953, he joined two others as the only trainers to ever win the Derby Trial Stakes and the Kentucky Derby with the same horse. The feat had been accomplished by Hanly Webb in 1924 with Black Gold and by Ben A. Jones who did it twice, first with Citation in 1948 and then with Hill Gail in 1952. In 1958, Jimmy Jones, son of Ben, became the fourth and last to do it when he won the two races with Tim Tam.The Vindicator (Youngstown, Ohio) - April 28, 2003 As at 2011, Hayward's win with Dark Star in the Kentucky Derby remains one of the biggest upsets in the history of the race. The loss by Native Dancer would be the only one of his twenty-two race career that would see the horse be inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown, Dark Star suffered a bowed tendon in the Preakness Stakes and finished fifth. The injury ended his racing career and he was retired to stud.Daytona Beach Morning Journal - March 26, 1954 Eddie Hayward resigned from Cain Hoy Stable in December 1954 and took over as trainer for a racing partnership headed by Dallas Cowboys owner Clint Murchison.

It gained attention in September 2011 when it became the target of an arson attack allegedly perpetrated by militant Jewish settlers. Arson attack The mosque was significantly damaged in an overnight arson attack on 5 September 2011, which took place at approximately 3:00 am local time (GMT+2). Two burning tyres were thrown through broken windows on the ground floor; the fire and vandalism were discovered by worshippers arriving for prayers later in the morning. Words in Hebrew had been graffitied on the walls, and included hateful incites against Muhammad and threats of further attacks. A star of David had been graffitied alongside the name of Migron, an unauthorised Jewish settlement about to the south where Israeli police had dismantled three structures the previous day. The attack is believed to have been perpetrated by militant Jewish settlers in retaliation for the demolitions in Migron. These had been ordered by Israel's supreme court in August in response to a pleading from Peace Now on the grounds that they were built on privately owned land. Newspapers, as well as Rabbis for Human Rights, reported that the attack on the mosque was apparently part of the notorious \\"price tag policy\\" of certain factions amongst settlers. Palestinian security authorities claimed this to be the sixth mosque in two years attacked by settlers in the West Bank. Israeli police began an investigation into the incident the following day. According to the United Nations, it is one of more than 250 incidents involving settlers in 2011 in which Palestinians were injured or their property was damaged. The Palestinian National Authority condemned the attack, pointing out that this was just one of several incidents of violent crime perpetrated by settlers in the West Bank. Prime Minister Fayyad argued that such attacks incite a cycle of violence and labelled it an act of terrorism. He was critical of the Israeli police and called on the Middle East Quartet to investigate the matter instead. The European Union's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton released a statement saying, \\"Attacks against places of worship undermine the freedom of religion or belief which is a fundamental human right.\\" She argued that incitements such as this were undermining the peace process by fostering distrust between the parties involved. The Secretary-General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, also condemned the attack, holding Israel fully responsible. He asked that human rights organisations work to prevent further acts of violence against Palestinians.

Early life  Laird was born in Hartstown, PA on May 4, 1978. He wrote songs and learned guitar in elementary school. After seeing a Randy Travis concert in high school, Laird claims he became fascinated with songwriting and production. He taught himself basic elements of music theory by listening to the radio and dissecting songs. Laird's parents took him in high school to see Middle Tennessee State University and its recording program, and he enrolled there in 1997, graduating in 2001 with a degree in Recording Industry Management. After college Laird moved to Nashville. Laird's first job in the industry was assistant tour manager for Brooks & Dunn, though he spent his weekends writing. He participated in songwriter nights in Nashville at venues such as Bluebird Cafe. In 2002, Chris Oglesby, at BMG Music at the time, offered Laird a publishing deal. BMG was later bought by Universal Music Publishing Group, which took over Laird's contract and made him a staff writer in 2008. While working at BMG he met a receptionist, Beth Mason. The two were married in 2010, and went on to co-found Creative Nation in 2011.  Music career  Early in his time at UMPG, Bill Luther took an interest in him and encouraged him as a writer.
