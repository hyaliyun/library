The genre gained attention in 2017 with the release of Jordan Peele's Get Out, a film highlighting occurrences of racial alienation, which veil a plot to abduct young African-Americans. Prior to Peele, other film actors, directors and critics had used the term to describe an emerging genre of cinema with examples from all over the globe. Many social thrillers focus on issues of race, class, gender, sexuality or nationhood, often within the format of genre films more broadly categorized as black comedy, film noir, drama, horror cinema, or Bollywood musicals, among others. Early usage Social thriller actor Sidney Poitier (left) at the 1963 March on Washington, alongside Harry Belafonte and Charlton Heston \\"Social thriller\\" first appeared in film criticism to denote films using elements of suspense to heighten dramatic tension caused by social inequity. Often appearing in quotes, the term was being used as early as the 1970s to retrospectively describe political neo-noir cinema. An early example comes from cinema writer Georges Sadoul's characterization of El Wahsh (\\"The Monster\\"), an Egyptian crime film entered into the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. Sadoul sums up the film as \\"a social thriller based on an authentic police case about police pursuit of a drug-addicted gangster.\\" Sadoul goes on to describe the film's documentary style and backdrop of life in the Egyptian countryside. Other early uses of the term can be found in descriptions of French New Wave films, such as The Nada Gang, Claude Chabrol's 1974 film inspired by the May 1968 events in France. In their book, French Culture Since 1945, Malcolm and Martin Cook wrote that \\"Chabrol's career has been almost exclusively devoted to what might be called the 'social thriller'\\" and go on to define the genre as, \\"films using a suspense format often akin to that of Hitchcock to comment on the deviousness and duplicity of French society.\\" Many other film critics bandied about the term in their reviews prior to the 2010s but seldom in a way that gave the social thriller its own status as a codified genre in cinema. Prior to 2017, most writers used the term only once, usually in a single review, and to characterize an individual film. In his biography on William Wyler, Axel Madsen calls the 1937 Humphrey Bogart picture Dead End a social thriller. TLA Video reviewer David Bleiler described the 1950 Sidney Poitier film No Way Out as \\"an exceptionally made, tense drama which succeeds both as medical soap opera and social thriller.\\" Douglas Brode called Spencer Tracy \\"the alienated anti-hero of the social thriller\\" for his 1955 performance in Bad Day at Black Rock. Another Poitier film, 1967's In the Heat of the Night, got tagged as social thriller by Leonard Maltin, and was also cited as such on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Both Tracy and Poitier also appeared in 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a film that would later be identified as a key \\"non-thriller\\" example of the social thriller genre. For films produced outside the U.S., more than one reviewer has named the 1961 British film Victim as a social thriller. As the first English language film on record to use the word \\"homosexual\\" in its dialogue, Victim raised controversy in the United Kingdom for its critique of Britain's anti-gay laws that would remain in place until the passing of Sexual Offences Act 1967 decriminalized homosexuality for men in England and Wales. Ismal Xavier called the 1962 Brazilian political train robbery film O Assalto ao Trem Pagador (\\"Assault on the Payroll Train\\") a social thriller. Taiwanese director Bai Jingrui's 1982 film Offend the Law of God has been called \\"an exploitation social thriller\\" and the 1996 Spanish film Taxi, about the rise of the racist right wing, has also been given the label. In his Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Cinema, author Peter Rollberg goes a bit further than the one-mention references of his peers. In describing the work of Russo-Belarusian director Aleksandr Faintsimmer, Rollberg writes, \\"Fainsimmer devoted himself to the traditionally underrepresented genre of the social thriller with blockbusters such as No Right to Fail (1974) and The Cafeteria on Piatnikskaia Street (1978).\\" Rollberg also names Leonid Filatov's 1982 film The Rooks and Vadim Derbenev's 1985 hit The Snake Catcher as landmarks of the genre in the Soviet Union. 21st century western cinema At the onset of the 2000s, critics and scholars continued to label a number of contemporary films as social thrillers. The authors of Sociology: An Introductory Textbook and Reader wrote of the 2002 British film Dirty Pretty Things as being \\"not a documentary but a social thriller which blends aspects of the global urban legends about child kidnapping for organs and prostitutes drugging unsuspecting barflies who wake up in a hotel bathtub minus a kidney.\\" The New Yorker echoed this sentiment, saying, \\"Dirty Pretty Things is not a violent thriller. It might be called a social thriller‚Äîa creepy, tightly knit suspense film that, on the fly, reveals more about the lives of immigrants in London than the most scrupulously earnest documentary.\\" Other films labeled as social thrillers from the first decade-and-a-half of the new millennium include 2005's British production of The Constant Gardener and the 2008 Italian film As God Commands, both based on the best-selling novels of the same names. The Wall Street Journal called 2011's The Social Network \\"Part morality play, part social thriller,\\" the 2012 Canadian child abduction film The Tall Man got called a social thriller for its DVD release, and the French film festival hit Corporate was called a social thriller in 2016, several months in advance of its 2017 release. Modern Indian cinema Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan speaking in April 2006 Like the West, Indian cinema has a longstanding tradition of identifying some movies as \\"social films\\" or \\"social problem films\\", genres that emerged when talking pictures first came to India in the 1930s. The rise of \\"social thriller\\" as a genre garnered familiarity in India, as it did in the U.S., in its association with a major box office hit. 2016's Pink, a courtroom drama that deals with rape, was India's highest- grossing film ever to be released. Pink starred longtime Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan, who named the film a social thriller. Bachchan said of Pink that, \\"the context and the premise of the film shall always be of prime interest,\\" but that \\"much is not spelt out because of the nature of the story and, of course, the nature of its genre‚Äîa social thriller!‚Äù Before Pink the term social thriller was applied occasionally by Bollywood's directors and marketers and then repeated by the press to describe selected movies, such as 2014's film Fugly starring olympic boxing medalist Vijender Singh. Prior to Fugly's release, the press were unfamiliar with the genre, and in a film preview the India Times said that it was \\"the movie that's been billed as a 'social thriller' (whatever that is).\\" After Fugly, other social thriller tags followed suit, such as 2014's Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain about the Union Carbide Disaster, and 2016's Laal Rang about the organized crime trafficking in human blood. South Indian film columnists may have been using the term prior to their North Indian counterparts. G. Dhananjayan called the 2009 Tamil language film Achchamundu! Achchamundu! (\\"There is fear! There is fear!\\") a social thriller, citing it as \\"one of the rare mainstream Tamil films with the subject on pedophiles.\\" Tamil director Bramma G. called his 2014 debut film, Kutram Kaditha, a social thriller. The same year Jean Marcose called his Malayalam film Angels a social thriller. Film Beat's Akhila Menon used the term to describe both Puthiya Niyamam and Evidam Swargamanu in 2015. Other Tamil social thrillers include 2016's Kabali, and Aagam, of which director Vijay Anand Sriram claimed, \\"has a message but it will not be preachy. It's a social thriller with commercial elements in it\\". Post-Pink social thrillers in Indian cinema have included Adanga Maru, Jhalki...Ek Aur Bachpan, Mulq, Pinu, Parari, Blue Whale, and Marainthirunthu, all released in 2018. Get Out and after Director and comedian Jordan Peele performing in 2012 Broadly categorized as a horror film, director Jordan Peele stated that his directorial debut, Get Out, was part of a lineage of social thrillers, meaning that whatever scary things manifest onscreen, society is actually the true evil. In a February 2017 interview, Peele told the Chicago Tribune, \\"I define 'social thriller' as thriller/horror movies where the ultimate villain is society.\\" In March he told the New York Times that social thrillers \\"all deal with this human monster, this societal monster. And the villain is us.\\" He later told New York Magazine, \\"I was trying to figure out what genre this movie was, and horror didn't quite do it. Psychological thriller didn't do it, and so I thought, Social thriller. The bad guy is society‚Äîthese things that are innate in all of us, and provide good things, but ultimately prove that humans are always going to be barbaric, to an extent. I think I coined the term social thriller, but I definitely didn‚Äôt invent it.\\"How Jordan Peele's 'Get Out' Got MadeVulture To coincide with the release of Get Out, Peele curated a film series for the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) called The Art of the Social Thriller. The series featured classic horror films like Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, The Silence of the Lambs, Candyman, The People Under the Stairs, and the first film of Wes Craven's Scream series. Peele also included films outside of the horror genre, such as psychological thrillers Funny Games and Misery, Hitchcock's mystery thriller Rear Window, and comedy-thriller The 'Burbs. The sneak preview of Get Out was preceded by the 1967 comedy-drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, the first Hollywood film to address interracial marriage and a big influence on the premise for Peele's own film. When asked about its inclusion in the series, Peele told the Village Voice, \\"It's not an actual thriller, it's just a great exploration of the social phenomenon of how we deal with race, putting it in a package that everyone can understand. Anybody can relate to the fear of meeting your potential in-laws for the first time... At a certain point with Get Out, I realized that I was making a sort of thriller take on Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.\\" After Get Out's success, Peele announced that he had plans to make four more social thrillers in the next decade. In an interview with Business Insider he said, \\"The best and scariest monsters in the world are human beings and what we are capable of especially when we get together. I've been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact, and each one of my movies is going to be about a different one of these social demons.\\" By the time Peel's second film, Us, was under production, it had veered away from its original inceptions as a \\"social\\" thriller and fell more squarely into the horror genre. Whereas Peele's treatment of Get Out's black protagonist and white antagonists made it a film about race, he strove to make Us not be about race. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to me that we can tell black stories without it being about race,‚Äù Peele told Rolling Stone in early 2019. ‚ÄúI realized I had never seen a horror movie of this kind, where there‚Äôs an African-American family at the center that just is. After you get over the initial realization that you‚Äôre watching a black family in a horror film, you‚Äôre just watching a movie. You‚Äôre just watching people. I feel like it proves a very valid and different point than Get Out, which is, not everything is about race. Get Out proved the point that everything is about race. I‚Äôve proved both points!‚Äù By mid-2017 the press had started touting upcoming films as belonging to the genre, including international Cannes Film Festival favorites like Colombia's Matar a Jes√∫s, France's L'Atelier; Brazil's Rifle, and the remake of Argentina's La Patota. Variety wrote that animated film Tales of the Hedgehog was both \\"a children‚Äôs thriller\\" and \\"a social thriller-fable\\" after director Alain Gagnol described it as a ‚Äúsuspenseful social fable.‚Äù From Hollywood, the social media scandal movie Assassination Nation, and Greg McLean and James Gunn's The Belko Experiment, were promised as social thrillers, as was Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit as part of the social thriller canon. Musician/author Boots Riley's 2018 directorial debut Sorry to Bother You was tapped as being a social thriller by both The Guardian and Deadline, and multiple reviewers compared Riley's film to Get Out. That same year Rolling Stone posited Tyrel, a drama about one black man's weekend getaway with a bunch of drunk white men, as a social thriller. In 2019 Luce, a film about the external expectations placed on young black men in America, got the social thriller tag after its debut at the Sundance Film Festival. On the eve of the 2019 Academy Awards The A.V. Club added Cam, a psychological horror film told from the perspective of an online sex worker, to the genre's roster, saying, \\"One year after Get Out, another social thriller deserves Oscar love for its script. Likewise the website Insider clamored \\"to see Lee Chang-dong's tense social thriller Burning in this race\\" for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2019 Academy Awards. After the 2019 Cannes Film Festival The Associated Press headline proclaimed that \\"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho‚Äôs social thriller Parasite wins Palme d‚ÄôOr\\" and that third-place jury prizes were also awarded to \\"two socially conscious thrillers: The French director Ladj Ly‚Äôs feature-film debut Les Miserables and Brazilian director Kleber Mendon√ßa Filho‚Äôs Bacurau.\\" With Get Out helping to codify the genre, critics have continued to apply the term retrospectively, with more than one review adding the 1975 science fiction thriller The Stepford Wives to the canon. Critique Use of social thriller as a genre term has come under scrutiny since its widened use. One critique is that niche genres such as horror are re-labeled to draw a more mainstream fanbase. In a news piece about 2017's most successful horror films, journalist Haleigh Foutch wrote that \\"Get Out is being billed as a 'social thriller' now that the film has dominated at the box office and conjured early awards buzz.\\" Critic Jacob Knight has also cited uses of \\"social thriller,\\" \\"social horror\\" and \\"elevated horror\\" to describe Get Out and the 2018 films Hereditary and A Quiet Place, saying, \\"'elevated horror' (or even 'social horror', for that matter) doesn‚Äôt exist. It never did, and it never will. Filmmakers have been attempting to distance themselves from the 'horror' label for decades, as it‚Äôs a genre that‚Äôs been ghettoized for most of its existence.\\" In an opinion piece for SYFY Wire Emma Fraser wrote that \\"social thriller\\" refers to a specific kind of horror but that \\"by dressing this genre up, it actually does it a disservice.\\" Fraser goes on to say that filmmakers like George Romero, David Cronenberg and John Carpenter have used the horror genre to address social issues such as racism or the AIDS epidemic, and that many horror films bear social significance without relying on the social thriller label. In other media =Literature= Social thriller author Ruth Rendell Outside the medium of cinema, literary critics have used the term \\"social thriller\\" as early as the first decade of the 2000s. Writing on the psychological crime novels of Ruth Rendell in 2002, Lidia Kyzlinkov√° at Masaryk University remarked, \\"Rendell may be seen as having developed a kind of social thriller, in which various representations around region, class, race, gender, or age form an important part of the plot.\\" Three years later Kyzlinkov√° subtitled another chapter on Rendell, \\"Social Thriller, Ethnicity and Englishness,\\" in which she characterized works whose plots focus less on detectives or police as being \\"socio-psychological, or social thrillers.\\" Also writing in 2002, The New York Daily News said that Iain Pears Riverhead's book The Dream of Scipio \\"uses a larger-than-ever canvas to construct this genre-bending historical and social thriller.\\" Business Wire later called Kathleen Kaufman‚Äôs 2009 dystopian novel The Tree Museum \\"an environmental thriller that follows a world completely transformed by an enigmatic and powerful totalitarian force\\" in a review titled, \\"New Social Thriller, The Tree Museum, to Challenge the Ethics of State-Enforced Environmentalism.\\" MacMillan Publishing described Six Suspects, Vikas Swarup's 2010 follow-up to Slumdog Millionaire as \\"a richly textured social thriller.\\" After its proliferation as a cinematic genre, the term was used to describe DC/Vertigo comic book Safe Sex. =Theatre and television= As film writers began applying the term with greater frequency after its 2017 upsurge, theatre critics followed suit. Time Out New York reviewer Adam Feldman wrote that the Broadway show Junk \\"melds a breadth of genres‚Äîcrime story, tragedy, issue play, cautionary tale‚Äîinto a fast-moving, broad-ranging social thriller.\\" By 2018 the term had leapt to television, and was used to describe the Netflix series What/If and indian series Criminal Justice. =Radio and podcasting= In September 2018 The New York Times highlighted a number of fiction podcasts as contributions to the social thriller genre, chiefly the politically charged dystopian fantasy Adventures in New America by filmmakers Stephen Winter and Tristan Cowen. Audio fiction publisher Night Vale Presents touted the term on its own website, citing comparisons to Boots Riley's film Sorry to Bother You and the work of Jordan Peele. The Times also cited Gimlet Media's subterranean serial The Horror of Dolores Roach and Panoply Media's airline disaster whodunit Passenger List as being among the social thrillers cropping up in the new wave of serialized audio fiction.

Biography Angelo Acerbi was born in Sesta Godano on 23 September 1925. On 27 March 1948, he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of La Spezia. After earning a degree in canon law, he obtained his license in theology. Having completed the course of study at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1954, he entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See. He worked in the nunciatures in Colombia, Brazil, Japan and France, as well as in the International Relations Department of the Holy See's Secretariat of State. On 22 June 1974, Pope Paul VI appointed him Archbishop of Zella in Tunisia, and apostolic pronuncio in New Zealand and apostolic delegate to the Pacific Ocean. He received the episcopal ordination on 30 June from Pope Paul, co-consecrators archbishops Giovanni Benelli, deputy for the General Affairs of the Secretariat of State, and Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy, secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. On 6 February 1979, he was named Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Fiji as well. On 14 August 1979 Pope John Paul II appointed him apostolic nuncio to Colombia. In the following February, Acerbi was hostage with 26 other presidents, many of whom belonged to various countries' diplomacy during an assault on the Embassy of the Dominican Republic, put in place by the communist guerrillas of 19 April Movement. The period of imprisonment lasted several weeks, during which Acerbi was allowed to celebrate Mass.Colombian terrorists wow Teheran-like siege, articolo su The Day del 2 aprile 1980, vedi. On 28 March 1990, he was transferred to Hungary, the first apostolic nuncio to be named after the establishment of Communism in that country. During Acerbi's diplomatic assignment in Hungary, the Holy See concluded an agreement with the Republic of Hungary on religious assistance to the Armed Forces and the Border Police and prepared another relating to the financing of public and other purely religious activities carried out by the Catholic Church in Hungary, in particular the financing of educational activities, which was signed shortly after the end of Acerbi's tenure in Hungary. On 13 January 1994 he was also appointed Apostolic Nuncio in Moldova. On 8 February 1997 he was transferred to the nunciature in the Netherlands. On 27 February 2001, Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation. On 2 June 2001, Pope John Paul named Acerbi to two curial positions, member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and member of the council of cardinals and bishops for the Section for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State. On 4 April 2002, the pope added membership in the Congregation for Bishops. On 21 June 2001, he was appointed prelate of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, tasked with overseeing the priestly life of its chaplains and assisting the Order's leaders in promoting the religious observance of its members. On 21 January 2006, Acerbi denounced the comments published in the Italian weekly Panorama a month earlier, which said that Acerbi was leading a faction of young adherents of the Order dissatisfied its failure to emphasize its Christian identity. On 4 July 2015, Pope Francis appointed a new prelate, Monsignor Jean Laffitte.

The program worked with community groups such as local governments, police departments, universities, and non-profits. In 2019, the Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) was established as a rebranding of the Obama-era initiative. In December 2016, the incoming Trump presidential transition team planned to stop the program from targeting white supremacists, which have committed bombings and shootings such as at a black church in Charleston. The program was also planned to be renamed to \\"Countering Radical Islamic Extremism\\". Congressional Republicans have criticized CVE for being politically correct, arguing that using the term \\"Radical Islam\\" would prevent violent attacks. Community groups have had concerns that the program could be used to target faith groups for surveillance. In May 2017, the Trump White House proposed to cut all funding to CVE. In July 2017, George Selim, a Republican who worked in the Bush administration and headed the CVE, resigned. Selim said that government cooperation with Muslim communities has proven crucial to preventing terrorist attacks but that Trump appointees saw no value in this effort. In August 2017, reacting to reports that the Trump administration rescinded a grant to an organization fighting against neo- Nazism, the Southern Poverty Law Center warned that the threat of domestic terrorism from white supremacists remained high, pointing to an attack in Portland that happened in May.

Early life and education Chen attended in Yilan and later earned a bachelor's degree in English from National Taiwan Normal University. Activism Chen has served the Parents' Association for Persons with Intellectual Disability as chairperson. The group has partnered with other organizations to run a charity car wash staffed by people with disabilities. In 2003, Chen stated that she would not oppose permitting sighted, licensed masseuses to operate as long as blind masseuses continued receiving strong legal protections. She personally criticized students who protested against Chen Shui-bian's reelection as president in 2004, commenting, \\"There is no meaning in their protest. If they want to talk, they should be out there talking about issues relating to them. Why are their demands the same as the pro-blue camp's?\\" In 2006, she voiced opposition to revisions of the National Pension Draft Law, stating that pensions should be collected based on a person's ability to work, not the severity of their disability. Later that year, she blamed legislator Lin Yi-shih for stripping funding from the community healthcare system, which caused many hospitals' developmental delay assessment units to close. Political career In 2007, Chen was ranked first on the Democratic Progressive Party list and subsequently won election to the Legislative Yuan. In April 2008, Chen opposed an amendment to the Statute Governing Public Welfare Lotteries that reclassified sports lotteries as a subset of public welfare lotteries while mandating that eighty percent of the funds raised be earmarked for sports, and twenty percent for social welfare initiatives. Chen stated in December 2008 while discussing revisions to the Assembly and Parade Act that she preferred notice of a gathering be given to law enforcement on a voluntary basis. She expressed support for Chen Shui-bian in January 2009, while he was imprisoned on corruption charges. Later that month, Chen Chieh-ju described the Ministry of the Interior led by Liao Liou-yi as \\"the ministry of handing out money...carelessly\\" after it was reported that vouchers worth NT$11 million had been misplaced. By January 2009, Chen was highly ranked by the Citizen Congress Watch, a watchdog organization. In March, she pushed the Ma Ying-jeou administration to extend unemployment benefits to a full year. In April 2009, Chen coauthored an amendment to the Civil Code permitting divorce proceedings to begin via mediation. She later called for legal amendments permitting community members to report cases of child abuse, a responsibility otherwise delegated to police, teachers, medical personnel, and social workers. In September, Chen spoke out against the establishments of casinos in Penghu, disputing the county government's claim that launching a casino operation would help the local economy, providing 25,000 jobs and 5 million visitors annually. In 2010, Chen proposed raising compensation for people who had died from the use of a H1N1 vaccine developed by Adimmune Corporation to NT$12 million, after the Centers for Disease Control had already announced a raise to NT$6 million from NT$2 million. She expressed reservations about a proposal by the Ministry of the Interior in October that sought to allow absentee voting in Taiwanese elections starting in 2012, believing that the plan had not done enough to ensure against the tampering of ballots. She praised the passage of amendments to the Social Assistance Act in December, stating that the revisions brought Taiwan in line with other regions in considering edibility of low-income households for government subsidies. In March 2011, Chen and fellow legislator Yu Jane-daw called on the Executive Yuan to suspend mayor Jason Hu after a fatal fire at ALA Pub in Taichung, which premier Wu Den-yih refused to do. In April, a month after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster had occurred, Chen derided the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China for its hesitation in offering aid, and the Atomic Energy Council for its technological ability to detect nuclear radiation. Near the end of her first term, Chen proposed an amendment to the Consumer Debt Clearance Act, which sought to simplify the process for debt settlement. She helped pass revisions to the Equalization of Land Rights Act, remarking \\"Transparency in the real-estate market is the most basic request of consumers\\" in support of the changes. Chen pushed for the status of people with HIV/AIDS to be registered at the Centers for Disease Control, opposing efforts to list that information directly on national health insurance cards. The Citizen Congress Watch again ranked Chen one of the best lawmakers at the end of her first term in office. In June 2011, the Democratic Progressive Party finalized the list of legislative candidates contesting at large seats. Chen was ranked first for the second consecutive election cycle, and retained her seat on the Legislative Yuan. Shortly after her reelection in January 2012, Chen filed a lawsuit against Hu Wei-jen and Chang Ji-ping, accusing the pair of spying on DPP presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen. Later that year, she objected to a levy raising premiums on national health insurance and criticized an amendment to the Medical Care Act protecting medical professionals from malpractice lawsuits. In 2013, Chen proposed a revision to the Nuclear Reactor Facilities Control Act mandating a local referendum be held wherever a new nuclear plant was to begin operation. She opposed a second bill intended to legalize gambling, this time on the outlying island of Matsu. Throughout the year, Chen reported on various medical issues, drawing attention to drugs that were manufactured with misleading authorizations, as well as long-term elder care. In 2014, she backed calls to help the elderly find adequate housing, eventually proposing related revisions to the Senior Citizens‚Äô Welfare Act in 2015. That June, she helped revise the Income Tax Act, turning profits from housing sales into taxable income. =Political stances= As a lawmaker, Chen continued advocating for the rights of the disabled. In addition, Chen repeatedly denounced the use of excessive force by law enforcement personnel. She has attended multiple rallies commemorating the 1959 Tibetan uprising, and supported calls to extend right of residency to Tibetans married to Taiwanese nationals. In 2009, Chen opposed offering insurance to foreign elder caregivers, fearing that domestic caregivers would lose their jobs. She later rejected a 2011 appeal to extend the duration for which foreign caretakers are permitted to stay in Taiwan, favoring changes to legislation standardizing long-term care instead. In 2015, Chen submitted a motion to the Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee of the Legislative Yuan that would bar rich families from hiring foreign caretakers. Personal Chen's son has developmental and physical disabilities.

It contains Neolentiporus squamosellus and the type species N. maculatissimus. The genus was circumscribed by mycologist Mario Rajchenberg in 1995. Description Neolentiporus is characterized by medium to large fruit bodies that have stipes and a poroid hymenium on the cap underside. The caps are circular to fan-shaped with a scaly surface, and have an off-centre or lateral stipe that sometimes is reduced to a short, robust umbo. The hyphal system is dimitic with clamped, irregularly thick-walled generative hyphae that do not react with cresyl-blue stain. The skeletal hyphae are unbranched, thick-walled, and are strongly metachromatic in cresyl-blue. Spores are cylindrical, hyaline, thin-walled, inamyloid, and binucleate. Neolentiporus causes a brown rot. Molecular phylogenetic analysis shows Neolentiporus to be closely related to Buglossoporus. This latter genus, however, has a monomitic hyphal system in the trama, and lacks metachromatic skeletal hyphae.

Early life and education Mary Garard was born in Clarksburg, Western Virginia on 3 March 1852. She was of Pennsylvanian stock, in whom the Quaker and Baptist blood mingled. She was \\"fondly proud\\" of the home of her adoption, Iowa. She was left motherless at the age of five and her father was killed in the service of his country a few years later. She overcame many difficulties in acquiring an education. In spite of ill health, the discouragement of friends and financial pressure, she maintained her independence and kept herself in school for eight years. She spent two years in the academy in Washington, Iowa, three years in the Iowa State Industrial College, and three years in Hillsdale College, Michigan. Career While in the last-named place, she completed the English Theological course with several elective studies, having charge of one or two churches all the time and preaching twice every Sunday during the three years. She says: \\"I never spent much time over the oft controverted question, 'Shall woman preach?' I thought the most satisfactory solution of the problem would be for woman quietly, without ostentation or controversy, to assume her place and let her work speak for itself.\\" After five years of faithful, fruitful service in the Free Baptist Church, convictions of truth and duty caused her to sever ties and cast her lot with another church. For eight years she was engaged in the regular pastoral work of the Universalist Church, during which time she was a close and thorough student, keeping well informed on the questions of the day. Never satisfied with present attainments, she pursued a more advanced theological and philosophical course, in which she passed an examination and received the degree of BD from Lombard University, Illinois. She was an enthusiastic temperance and Grand Army worker, and for two years was National Chaplain of the Woman's Relief Corps. In April, 1885, she was married to I. R.

Levin learned that a number of celebrities frequented the barbershop, and so he sent Glyn around to the restaurants, bars, churches, gyms and tattoo parlors in Compton, Inglewood and other less-than-glitzy neighborhoods to discover other secret celebrity haunts.

The town was originally known as Goldfield, it was later renamed Youngberg and once again was named Goldfield by the current owners.Roadside America The list includes a photographic gallery of some of the town's historic structures which were either restored or rebuilt. The town was founded in 1893, after the discovery of gold in the surrounding area of the Superstition Mountains. The town was abandoned twice by its residents, after the mine veins faulted. The land where the town is located was purchased by a private investor and is now a tourist attraction. Goldfield's Superstition Narrow Gauge Railroad is the only narrow-gauge railroad in operation in Arizona. Other attractions include re-enactments of gunfights on the Main Street of the town. Brief history Collin Hakes, Riley Morse and Orlando and Orin Merrill were the first to discover gold in the Goldfield area of the Superstition Mountains.City of Mesa Cemetery Soon thereafter, prospectors came to the area in search of gold. In 1893, the mining town, which became known as Goldfield, was founded next to the Superstition Mountain in what was then the Arizona Territory. The town, in its heyday, reached a population of about 4000 residents. It had a hotel, general store, post office, church and school. The Goldfield Post Office was established on October 7, 1893.Granger, Byrd H., Arizona's Names (X Marks the Place). Tucson: The Falconer Publishing Company, 1983. p.692 When the mine vein faulted in 1897, the grade of ore dropped leaving the miners without a job. The town began to suffer since its economy depended heavily on the earnings of the miners who moved out. It was not long before the rest of the towns residents relocated to other areas leaving Goldfield a ghost town.Granger, Byrd H., Arizona's Names (X Marks the Place).

In 1910, several mines were opened nearby with the installation of a mill and cyanide plant. A small community called Youngberg evolved around the ghost town. The town was named after George U. Young, secretary of Arizona and acting governor at the time. Young was interested in the development of the mining industry of the area. He became President and general manager of the Madizelle Mining Company and Young Mines Company, Ltd. However, the mines faulted again and by 1926, the town was once again deserted.

He began his career by founding two rent-to-own businesses and later made his fortune after founding National Cash Advance. He later began investing in businesses and real estate speculations, and lost all of his assets as a result of the Great Recession.  Early life and education  McKenzie was born to Bob and Gail Bettis McKenzie in 1953 in Bradley County, Tennessee. He had one brother, Mark Patrick McKenzie. He attended Bradley Central High School, where he played football and baseball. He graduated in 1971. After high school, he took a job as a paperboy for the Chattanooga Times Free Press and the Cleveland Daily Banner.  Business career  In the 1980s, McKenzie founded two rent-to-own businesses in Cleveland. In 1994 he founded the National Cash Advance, a payday loan company. He sold the company in 1999. At the time of its selling, the National Cash Advance included 550 stores nationwide. In the early 2000s McKenzie began investing in real estate developments that he believed would increase in value by borrowing money from multiple banks. These included hundreds of acres of land in East Tennessee and over 100 businesses including a golf course in Ooltewah, bowling alley, a hotel in Sweetwater, a used car dealership and a shopping center on Paul Huff Parkway in Cleveland that was never built. These reckless investments would eventually lead to his bankruptcy. In 2004 he founded McKenzie Trucking & Leasing, a trucking company. Bankruptcy In December 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and the beginning of the Great Recession, McKenzie filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the United States District Court in Chattanooga, Tennessee disclosing $151 million in debts and assets of over $100 million. He was then ordered to make $11.5 million in lease payments on defaulted properties. The following year he lost millions of his assets including an unfinished home.  Philanthropy  McKenzine made numerous donations to local schools and causes, including the United Way, Lee University, and Habitat for Humanity. In the late 1990s, McKenzie and his wife gave a donation of $2 million to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga to help pay off the debt on the school's basketball arena, The Roundhouse. In 2000, the arena was renamed the McKenzie Arena. In 2000 McKenzie and his wife pledged $4 million to an athletic center that adjoins the Neyland-Thompson Sports Complex at The University of Tennessee in Knoxville. As a result of his bankruptcy McKenzie was unable to complete his pledge, and in 2009, his name was removed from the building.  Personal life  McKenzie was of the Pentecostal faith and was a member of Mount Olive Church of God. In 1979 McKenzie married businesswoman Brenda Lawson. They had two children, Ashley and Steve, Jr. They divorced in 2000. In 2006 he married Rebecca Harris. McKenzie died on May 2, 2013 from heart failure.

It is composed of 120 buildings and structures, of which 70 are residential. with There are also a couple of churches on the east side of the district, and an old hotel was converted into apartments. People began to settle here as early as 1836 and the city was platted in 1847. The Methodist Episcopal Church established the Iowa Conference Male and Female Seminary here in 1853, and it changed its name to Cornell College four years later. King Memorial Chapel (1876) is individually listed on the National Register. The Chicago and North Western Railroad came to town in 1859. After the American Civil War the town's economy expanded with larger factories, and the area's prosperity included the vast agricultural lands that surround Mount Vernon. The first period of growth in the 1850s saw several brick residences built, and a second period of growth from 1885 to 1900 saw a large number of frame residences built. Early residential development began around the college campus on its east and north side. By the early 1900s development reached the west side of the campus. Construction of buildings on the Cornell Campus continued after the post-World War II population boom. Architect William Jay Brown designed college buildings in the 1930s, the Cedar Rapids architectural firm Green and Co. designed buildings in the 1950s, and Harry Weese and Associates in the 1960s.

The community is located along Pennsylvania Route 14 north of Williamsport. Ralston has a post office with ZIP code 17763.  History  Ralston was founded with the construction of the Northern Central Railroad in the 1840s. This would eventually become the Pennsylvania Railroad. From the beginning, a substantial locomotive terminal was here. The short range of steam locomotives of the time made it a necessity. In addition, there was a steep gradient to Leolyn to the north via Roaring Branch. Most trains required two locomotives or more to climb this hill, and pusher locomotives were based in Ralston. Around the turn of the 20th century, a tannery sprung up south of Ralston, and this operation soon spawned a logging operation. The Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company, together with the tannery owners, built what would become the Susquehanna & New York Railroad. This line operated passenger services into Ralston to connect with PRR trains, and operated a small yard in South Ralston, close to the tannery. In the beginning, it was very successful, but soon fell on hard times as the local forests were depleted. After a fire destroyed the tannery in the 1920s, the S&NY; seldom made a profit, and operated a skeleton service through the 1930s. In 1942, with World War II underway, the Interstate Commerce Commission granted permission for the S&NY; to cease operations, and the rails were soon pulled up and used at an ammunition plant in Williamsport. The CPL Company ran their log trains on a line parallel to the PRR as far as the now-extinct town of Grays Run, where there was a saw mill. This line featured a large wooden trestle crossing Lycoming Creek and the PRR just south of Ralston. When the trees ran out around 1910, the saw mill closed and Grays Run ceased to exist. The PRR terminal saw great success through the 1910s and 1920s. A nearby mine provided high-quality coal for the PRR's passenger engines, and there were also two small factories. One produced bricks, the other baseball bats. The five-track yard was usually busy, with many coal trains originating and terminating here. There was also a daily high-priority 'symbol freight' to Altoona. Three passenger trains each way called at Ralston six days a week (one was an express for which Ralston was a flag stop). Larger and larger locomotives came into use, and by 1925, L1-class 2-8-2s were the standard power for most freights. The end came for this vibrant terminal in 1930. With the Great Depression hitting hard and longer-range engines in use, Ralston terminal was closed and the pusher locomotives transferred to Williamsport. The engine terminal, wye track, and other structures associated with the terminal were torn down. The yard was kept to store redundant freight cars, while the siding was still used. The water columns remained. Around 1935, a coal mining operation began nearby, and two large steam-powered shovels were acquired and transported to the mine. The banks of Rock Run were lowered to allow the machines to pass, and this led to a major flood not long after. The railroad was heavily damaged, but soon repaired. After the United States entered World War II, the terminal was partially restored. Though pusher locomotives had always taken water here between their runs, the old ashpit track was restored and a platform built for trucks to dump coal into the tenders of locomotives. For a short time, there was a crew assigned for each of three shifts. After some clever accounting by one engineer, the railroad closed the terminal once again. For the rest of its existence, the Ralston siding remained useful, as it was one of the longest on the Elmira Branch. The station burned to the ground in 1941 and was never rebuilt. PRR successor Penn Central closed the Elmira Branch in 1972 after floods destroyed a significant portion of the line. Into the 21st century, a truss bridge remained over Lycoming Creek, but was unfortunately removed. Almost nothing remains of either the PRR or S&NY.; Much of Ralston's history is mentioned in the book Set Up Running by John Orr.

She researched and published extensively on Southeast Asian ferns, and in her retirement she discovered a fern in southern Spain that had previously been thought to be an exclusively tropical species.  Early life  Molesworth Allen was born on 21 July 1913 in ≈åp≈çtiki, a small town in the North Island of New Zealand. Her father, Arthur, a farmer, was the Paris-born younger son of a Cornwall rector, the 8th Viscount Molesworth.Cracrofts Peerage accessed 17 August 2017 Her mother, born Nellie Maud Banks, was a friend of the suffragist Pankhursts. Molesworth Allen suffered tuberculosis, polio and cancer as a child and spent most of her childhood in hospitals and unable to attend schools. However, both her parents were passionate about nature and wildlife, particularly birds, and as a result she grew up with a love of flora and fauna.  Career  Molesworth Allen became interested in botany through Lucy Cranwell, a botanist at the Auckland Museum. Cranwell introduced her to systematic biology and encouraged her interest in natural history. She was also influenced by John Holloway who inspired her interest in ferns. In 1939, Molesworth Allen was involved in the establishment of the Auckland Botanical Society and was its inaugural secretary. During World War II Molesworth Allen volunteered for the Women's Auxiallary Air Force, before replacing Cranwell as botanist at Auckland Museum from 1944 to 1947. In these years she made important additions to the museum's collections, including mosses and sedges and the field notebooks of T.F. Cheeseman. In 1947 Molesworth Allen received a scholarship to study in Basel, Switzerland. Stopping over in Malaya, she met and married Geoffrey Allen; declining the scholarship in Switzerland, she instead settled in Malaya where she trained in tropical botany and worked in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. From 1948 she travelled extensively in Southeast Asia, particularly to Malaysia, Borneo and Thailand, observing plants and collecting samples from the jungles. However, her work became dangerous during the 1948‚Äì1960 State of Emergency as Communist guerillas set up camps in the jungles. In 1963 Molesworth Allen retired to Los Barrios in Andalusia, Spain, where she continued to collect and study plants, particularly ferns. In January 1965 she discovered the fern Psilotum nudum (L.) P. Beauv. growing in Algeciras in southern Spain, which had previously been assumed to be a solely tropical species. As a result of her discovery, the area was extensively studied and eventually protected as a national park, Los Alcornocales Natural Park. = Publications =  Books  * Some Common Trees of Malaya (1957) Eastern Universities Press * Malayan Fruits: An Introduction to the Cultivated Species (1967) D.

The hybrid plants Narcissus x alleniae and Centaurea molesworthiae were named after Molesworth Allen. A part of the Gua Tempurung, the largest limestone cave in Peninsular Malaysia, is named the Molesworth Allen Tunnel after her.

It stars Maika Monroe and Matt O'Leary as two American tourists in Iceland who find everyone else on the island has mysteriously vanished. It premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival and was released theatrically in the United States on March 24, 2017.  Plot  American tourists Jenai and Riley arrive in Iceland and visit several landmarks. Riley has taken his father's Rolleiflex camera and plenty of film. When Jenai questions why he prefers it over a modern digital camera, Riley says he prefers to capture the imperfections of the moment rather than have a computer chip auto-correct all the errors. They visit an old church, and a priest tells them some of its history, calling the pre-Christian times simpler. Jenai reveals that her father is a preacher, though she says his church was not as pretty. After retiring for the night, Jenai seems to wakes up in the middle of the night and has trouble falling back asleep. Looking out the window to admire the view, she sees strange flashes of the Northern Lights in the distance. Hours later, Riley wakes Jenai to get breakfast. They are frustrated to find that their lodging is not serving breakfast, then confused when they find no staff. They continue having trouble locating other people once they leave: the streets are empty, the stores have no staff, and nobody answers their calls. They spot a running car, and, not being able to locate the owner, appropriate it. As they discuss the possible reasons why the city has become empty, Jenai repeatedly attempts to contact her family in America to no avail. The power and water remain running, but the live television stations broadcast only test signals. Confused, Riley and Jenai return to the hotel after eating, finding no websites have been updated since yesterday. Riley remains optimistic, and suggests they make the most of the situation. He leads them on a shopping spree, eventually filling up two SUVs with goods from the seemingly abandoned stores. He amuses himself by photographing Jenai at scenic locations and performing stunts. Jenai, however, begins sinking into depression, missing her old life. She is further frustrated when Riley injures himself during a reckless stunt, and she pressures him to promise not to put himself at any further risk. As their supplies grow scarcer, Jenai and Riley are forced to ration. Riley angers Jenai when he eats perishable food out of the agreed-upon order based on expiration date. He says he can simply farm for more food if necessary, but she insists they follow the agreement. Seeing Jenai's poor mood, Riley attempts to cheer her by bringing her to the abandoned husk of an airplane he found. Riley calls it beautiful, but Jenai sees only a reminder of the dead world they now inhabit. After Jenai becomes overwhelmed by the decaying city, Riley suggests they go camping. Exploring a cabin, they come upon an old man named Nils. After they give him food and water, he explains that he left the city early on and returned to his cabin. Initially excited to find another survivor, Riley becomes frustrated with Nils' defeatist attitude. Nils tells Jenai about his home life: as a young man, he left his family for lengthy periods to make money as a fisherman. When he returned, he found they had changed. Jenai is disturbed when he says he did not protest this, as he believes it is useless to fight against God's will, which he says does not take humanity into consideration. The next morning, Riley tells Jenai that Nils has died. Thinking back to his philosophy, she asks why they should even bother burying him. Riley insists on doing it because \\"it's what we do\\". After they return to the city, Jenai becomes obsessed with searching for more survivors. Riley suggests she is looking for answers where there are none and that they should instead be trying to make the best of their new life. Jenai excitedly opens an email waiting for her on their laptop but is crushed when it is revealed to be a picture from Riley, who is enthused about taking pictures of Iceland in a new season. Riley, when he returns home, becomes concerned when he finds a package of developed pictures left for him by Jenai. Looking all over for her, he finally finds her body floating in a geothermal pool, having apparently drowned herself. Riley initially attempts suicide but instead drives off, anguished, without burying her.

The story follows the members of a secret U.S. government agency known as the Department of Diachronic Operations (D.O.D.O.) as they attempt to change history through the use of magic. Stephenson and Galland had previously written together on The Mongoliad. Plot U.S. Army Major Tristan Lyons hires Dr. Melisande Stokes, a Harvard linguistics lecturer, to translate a variety of historic texts. The work is classified, to the point that Lyons cannot even reveal the full name of D.O.D.O, the secret government agency that he works for. Stokes' translations suggest that magic and witches existed in the historical record, and also that magic grew weaker and ceased to function sometime during the Industrial Revolution. Stokes and Lyons eventually discover that photography nullifies magic in the general area by causing a wave function collapse. Magic use ended worldwide when a photograph was taken of the solar eclipse of July 28, 1851. Lyons recruits Dr. Frank Oda, a former MIT physicist who once worked on a device that could prevent wave function collapse. The device is somewhat like the box in the Schr√∂dinger's cat experiment, though not (potentially) deadly to anyone inside. At the same time, Stokes is contacted by Erszebet Karpathy, a Hungarian witch with a supernaturally-extended lifespan who claims to have met Stokes in 1851 London. Stokes learns that D.O.D.O. stands for the Department of Diachronic Operations, and that Lyons intends to build a device that will enable magic-assisted time travel. Over the next five years, D.O.D.O. grows in size and scope as a project of IARPA and the Director of National Intelligence. Agents are trained in period-specific languages and combat techniques and magically sent back to 1601 London and the 1203-1204 Constantinople, among other times and places. The object is to alter historical events to subtly help the United States government, but it has to be done carefully and methodically to avoid Diachronic Shear, a catastrophic magical explosion that occurs when history is changed too much or too quickly. Witches are recruited to form a time travel network and some are even brought to the present to assist D.O.D.O. directly. One of these witches manages to gain control of the agency through the use of magic, and sends Stokes back in time to July 1851 in the hopes that she will be stranded there when magic ceases to work. The D.O.D.O. organization falls apart as members generally fall into two sides: a conspiracy of witches who want to sabotage the foundations of photography (and science itself) and the protagonists who pledge to counter their efforts. Style The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O. consists of multiple forms of narrative. The core novel is the first-person \\"Diachronicle\\" of Melisande Stokes as written in London in July 1851. Her notes are supplemented with journal entries, transcripts, online chat, and other forms of communication. Each is in a different format and font, and many texts are written from the point of view of secondary characters. Some parts are redacted or incomplete. It is explained later that they were secretly (and haphazardly) stolen from D.O.D.O. servers as the organization was collapsing. Reception Kirkus Reviews wrote that the \\"story gets weirder and more madcap\\" as it goes, but called the novel \\"a pleasing combination of much appeal to fans of speculative fiction.\\" Financial Times also praised the wit and \\"healthy sense of absurdity.\\" However, The Guardian found that much of the humor didn't work, but that \\"though it‚Äôs no comic classic, The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O. is big, roomy and enjoyable.\\" References Category:2017 American novels Category:2017 science fiction novels Category:Novels about time travel Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels by Neal Stephenson Category:Novels by Nicole Galland Category:Literary collaborations Category:Bureaucracy in fiction ","title":"The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O."},{"id":"54875472","text":"Mohamed Abdulla Abdelaslam (born 1954) is a retired Libyan long jumper.

Early life  Yvon Kimpiobi was born on 1 June 1923 in Kikongo-Mitshakila (near Bulungu, Bandundu), Kwango, Belgian Congo to Dias Suing Mabong Ngul Mun and Nkubiya Nazur of the Mbel clan of the Yansi tribe. He undertook six years of primary studies and six years of commercial and administrative studies in Leverville before entering the workforce. In 1943 he became an accounting clerk at Huileries et Plantations du Kwango in Fumu-Mputu, Masi-Manimba Territory. Six years later he was hired by Almeida Fr√®res in Kikwit. Kimpiobi served there until 1952 when he became a clerk in the colonial administration attached to the secretariat of Kwango Province (reformed as Kwilu in 1954). He also married and had a total of 20 children.  Political career  In the 1957 municipal elections Kimpiobi won the office of Chef de Centre extra-coutumier de Kikwit. Two years later he formed part of a Kwilu delegation of customary chiefs that met with the Belgian minister of colonies to discuss the L√©opoldville riots. In the Congo's first national elections in 1960 Kimpiobi was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a representative from Kwilu Province and a member of the Parti Solidaire Africain (PSA) with 6,281 preferential votes. When the PSA split he aligned himself with Cl√©ophas Kamitatu's moderate wing of the party. On 6 March 1962 he was elected President of the Chamber, defeating the parliamentary opposition candidate, 59 votes to 51. He held the office until November 1962. In September of that year he led a small parliamentary delegation on a good-will trip to the Republic of China. In 1965 he was reelected to the Chamber as a member of the new Convention Nationale Congolaise. He again served as President of the Chamber from that September until June 1967. That year the Chamber was dissolved, ending Kimpiobi's tenure as a national deputy. In June 1968 he was made a member of the political bureau of the Mouvement Populaire de la R√©volution (MPR). In December 1970 the bureau was reorganised and he was dismissed from his position. In 1997 Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila seized control of the Congo. Afterwards he created a commission to draft a new constitution for the country. Kimpiobi was appointed to the commission.

Biography Fatma Shanan was born in 1986 and grew up in Julis, Israel. As a kid she attended private art lessons due to the lack of art courses in her elementary school's curriculum. She studied visual arts at the Oranim Academic College from 2007 to 2010. Afterwards she studied in the studio of traditionalist Israeli artist Elie Shamir for a year. She lives and works between Tel Aviv and JulisMarnin- Distelfeld, S. (2018). A space of their own: Arab women artists in israel: Identity of a 'double-minority'. Journal of International Women's Studies, 19(2), 65-83. . Shanan is known for her figurative oil paintings of scenes of Druze villages and is inspired by 19th and 20th century realism. Almost all of her paintings are derived from staged photographs, which utilize family and friends as models. Many of her pieces feature traditional Eastern carpets, which contrast with her Western landscapes. The image of the oriental carpet is prominent in the Druze culture and common in most households. The carpet serves as an object of prayer, which must stay clean and not be stepped on. The maintenance of the carpet is often a job attended to by a woman. Her work primarily deals with identity through the representation of figures in domestic and public spheres. She especially focuses on her identity as women within her community and how that has impacted her life, aspiring to develop more fluidity between genders and other demographics. She has also produced several self-portraits, which similarly contain carpet patterns or other objects showing identity. One piece, titled \\"Floating Self Portrait\\" depicts Shanan levitating over a carpet, which was developed from a video she took in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Exhibitions Fatma Shanan held solo and group exhibitions in galleries and museums around the world, including solo exhibitions in Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Zemack Contemporary Art, and Umm al- Fahm Art Gallery. She has participated in many group exhibitions including ones at the Museum of Islamic Art in Jerusaelm, Janco Dada Museum, Bloomfield Science Museum, The Mediterranean Biennale in Sakhnin, Fresh Paint art fair and Alfred Institute for Contemporary Art. Collections Fatma Shanan's works are part of collection of Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

The group was led by Major Erik Greenwood, Major Jasper Rootham and included Sergeant W. Anderson (W/T), Sergeant C. E. Hall (RAF) (W/T), Lieutenant E. \\"Micky\\" Hargreaves and a Royal Yugoslav Army (RYA) officer code-named \\"Arlo\\".  Purpose  While Operation Bullseye delivered permanent British presence at Chetniks' headquarters of Colonel Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, this expedition was a sub-mission to his regional headquarters. In this case, to a strategically important location, able to monitor and disrupt shipping on Danube (transporting Romanian oil crucial for the war effort), Belgrade‚ÄìSalonika railway (used for supply of German troops in North Africa) and Bor copper mines‚Äîthe largest in Europe.  Arrival and initial activities  The group arrived in two separate trips. Greenwood, Anderson and \\"Arlo\\" flew from Derna airfield and were parachuted in mid-April 1943. Due to bad weather, Rootham, Hall and Hargreaves abandoned the first two attempts and were finally successful on 21 May, landing at Homolje Mountains. British ambition for chetniks' engagement was in the acts of sabotage and undermining German war efforts. The strategy meant that they would be supplied with explosives, medical equipment and similar, while they were asking for light-machine guns and ammunition, boots, uniforms and wireless accessories. The discrepancy of intentions between two allied armies became obvious very early in the engagement and grew ever-wider. In the following few weeks, the mission visited local commanders in the region, passing through Vlaole and Gornjane. On 31 May, en route to Deli Jovan, they encountered a young wireless enthusiast who made the very first radio contact between Mihailoviƒá and the British naval monitoring station in Malta in August 1941, thus starting the chain of events. Throughout the period, the lack of four-engine long-range aircraft and trained crew, unpredictable weather over the Mediterranean, general bureaucracy and feeling of a 'side-show' meant that flights were fewer and cargo continued to consist of explosive and medical supplies, rather than small arms and ammunition. This raised suspicions of the hosts and frustration of the visitors. On 15 June, three additional soldiers were parachuted. David Russell and his W/T operator Nicolae Turcanu who had a mission to get to Romania (Operation Ranji) as well as a Polish army officer called \\"Nash,\\" who was to engage with Polish POWs escaped from the Bor mines.  Summer  On 26 June, Rootham observed German-uniformed Slovak soldiers attack the village of Rudna Glava, and saw civilians fleeing across the fields with their life belongings and livestock. The local Serb commander asked him to report to the BBC that 150 civilians were killed. Rootham disputed the number, and the officer reduced it to seventy. Later that year, when passing through the village itself, Rootham had asked about the number of casualties in the incident and was told that five people were killed then. Shortly afterwards, he also realised that instead of engaging German or Bulgarian troops, local chetnik commander was fighting the partisans. Rootham considered this a clear violation of the agreement and stated that \\"the arms which we supplied were to be used for fighting the Germans and not for keeping in cold storage or for civil war\\".  Autumn and winter  On 21 August, while waiting for an aircraft drop, the group came very near German soldiers spending the night in Crnajka. Chetnik commander had over 60 troops at his disposal and could have ambushed them but decided to withdraw instead. On 26 August, Germans set houses in Crnajka on fire as they were leaving. Rootham was upset that the enemy was let go unscathed, while their host, obeying his High Command, failed to engage and was fearful of reprisals. Later that day, the mission reached Leskovo for a pre-arranged conference with local commanders. They spoke openly criticizing their hosts' state of training of the troops, poor attention to their weapons as well as lack of discipline under fire or the threat of fire. They asked about Mihailoviƒá's plan for Eastern Serbia and demanded an immediate start of sabotage, stating that their rule was \\"No action, No support\\". To make matters worse, they quoted the Allied Command HQ telegrams stating that the partisans had been co-operative and had carried out actions. Chetnik commanders bitterly disagreed, claiming the lack of arms, as well as fear that Britain was willing to hand over the Balkans to Russia. Finally, they mentioned that they considered Allied Command instructions to be \\"requests\\" and not \\"orders\\". Regardless of the disagreements, the cargo and reinforcements continued to arrive and Lieutenant Hargreaves acquired his own W/T operator called Ridewood. The following month, as the Italians surrendered, new commander, Brigadier C. D. Armstrong had been appointed to Mihailoviƒá's HQ. On 20 September, new reinforcements Captain Patterson, Captain Vercoe, and Sergeant Scott were dropped. Patterson landed without a hitch, but both Vercoe and Scott fell in trees and were heavily injured, unable to walk. On 15 October, in order to try to sabotage the Bor copper mines, SOE headquarters sent 48-year-old Major Scorgie, a mining-engineer who was hoping to work with someone 'inside'. The ground attack did not go ahead mainly due to the RAF not being able to provide airplanes for the simultaneous diversionary air-raid.  Disruption of Danube shipping  On 22 October, Rootham, Greenwood and Scorgie left Gornjane and picked up a former Danube pilot to act as a technical adviser on their way to the river. The plan was to fire a 20-mm anti-tank gun and sink a tug-boat. The gun had 12 rounds of ammunition but no telescopic sights. They reached Boljetin and started the operation on 26 October around 09:15, by shooting at an approaching German tug-boat \\"Centaur\\". They did not sink the tug-boat but managed to hit it and disrupt the shipping lane for some time. The German propaganda leaflets denied this and stated that 150 of Mihailoviƒá's supporters in Belgrade were shot on 28 October, as a reprisal for this and for the two German soldiers killed near Kladovo earlier in the month. In spite of the awful consequences, Rootham saw the importance of the action.  The disappointment and withdrawal  In January 1944, the group had attempted to blow up the main railway bridge over the Morava river, south of Stalaƒá. Another railway bridge over the Ibar river was to be destroyed on the same day, thus paralyzing the north-south railway traffic in Serbia. General Mihailoviƒá was to issue the order for both attacks. In spite of frantic signals sent to Mihailoviƒá's HQ for the permission to carry out the plan, the order never came, damaging the morale of the group. On 2 March, the mission received the telegram that the decision had been taken to evacuate all the British men and officers at present with Mihailoviƒá and to move towards Brig Armstrong's HQ in Western Serbia. They were not surprised, as few weeks previously, Rootham noted: During this time, Lieutenant Hargreaves was captured by a small detachment of German ex-Afrika Corps. They delivered him to the Gestapo jail in Belgrade, beat him, took away his clothes and led him out six times to watch executions, not knowing whether he would be next. There, he saw hundreds of civilians shot which confirmed that stories of reprisals were not all invented by the Serbs. Capt Vercoe, still unable to walk, was captured near Gornja Mutnica on 24 March. Both men ended up in the notorious Oflag IV-C (Colditz Castle). Vercoe was repatriated in January 1945\\\\. while Hargreaves was freed by the American troops in April 1945\\\\. As they were preparing to leave, the group came under attack by soldiers of the 25th Bulgarian Division near ≈Ωagubica when local chetnik commander came to their rescue: The group received orders to join Brigadier Armstrong on and moved towards ƒåaƒçak, spending a night at Kaleniƒá monastery. On 16 April, they observed formations of B-17s and B-24s, flying north towards Belgrade. The heavy bombardment of the city on Orthodox Easter Sunday caused many civilian casualties and damaged the reputation and support for the Allies. A day later, the mission met up with Gen Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, whom Rootham found modest and conscientious, but also \\"desperately tired, sad and worried man\\". On 29 May, Rootham said goodbye to Mihailoviƒá, as well as ≈Ωivko Topaloviƒá and Stevan Moljeviƒá, and the following night was air-lifted to Bari. The next day he was joined by Erik Greenwood, which marked the end of their mission.

Early life and education  Al-Salloum was born on August 28, 1981 in Kuwait. He earned his master's degree in business administration and his bachelor's degree in computer science from Gulf University for Science and Technology. He's also earned a certification of international project management from the American Academy of Financial Management.  Views  =COVID‚Äì19 pandemic= In an interview on Thmanyah in March 2020, Al-Salloum speculated an unprecedented economic depression to take place in July 2020. The rationale was based on the paralysis of daily life caused by lockdowns, where curfews caused a real decrease in consumption levels. Accordingly, the global economy was negatively affected as a result of a series of decreases in demand on energy-products as well as many others. On the same interview, he mentioned how the global economy, including the economy of the United States, would benefit from lowering oil prices during the pandemic, which contradicted the United States' presidential political view on oversupplying the oil markets. As for regional economies, Kuwait's in particular, Al-Salloum warned that generous economic packages for the private sector will not be feasible for the economy when viewed in a macroeconomic perspective. He believes the private sector does not weigh enough export-driven value in the gross- domestic-product's equation. In terms of 2020 budget deficit in Kuwait, he believes the pandemic was not the real cause, but an accelerator. He also believes a conditional Public Debt Bill would be the best available option when other reforming legislations pass in parallel, in particular, the ones designated to accelerate the export-based private sector. =Economy of Kuwait= In a study he has published in Alqabas newspaper, as well as in other interviews, Al-Salloum illustrated how the economy of Kuwait is driven by formulas whose heavy-weighted variables are out of local control. He demonstrated how the factors of those variables are changing in an exponential manner; pressuring future economic circumstances to be even more severe. He concluded that future economy-related decisions must consider a sustainable positive outcome for the gross domestic product equation, which only occurs by stimulating exports, shortening imports, or both concurrently. =Budget deficits in Kuwait= In another study he has published in Kuwait Times newspaper, Al-Salloum concluded that financial waste, corruption, isolation of returns of sovereign funds or insufficient government operational management are not the real cause of state budget deficits but the inability to overcome macroeconomic-related issues, such as transforming the state economy to an economy that is led by an exports-based private sub-sector. =Kuwaiti vision 2035= Al-Salloum believes that Kuwaiti Vision 2035 has not followed the minimum standards of the sustainable development vision concept. His rationale was based on the insufficient methodology used to set the goals of that vision; by which a vision is just a collection of goals that will definitely be achieved once previously planned giant and large projects are executed. Hence, this vision would not require a real strategy to follow other than waiting. =Saudi vision 2030= Unlike Kuwaiti Vision 2035, Al-Salloum sees Saudi Vision 2030 as a vision that follows reasonable standards of the sustainable development vision concept; defending most of its strategies in a book of six chapters. The reason behind having Al-Salloum focusing on the Saudi Arabian economy is the belief that Kuwait's economy, once sustainable, will be attached to the closest largest economy, Saudi Arabian. =Diversified economy= Al-Salloum's advised that following the leads of macroeconomic theories will be of an added value in moving the GCC economy from oil-based to diversified. Except for Kuwait, the decision-making process in all other GCC is centralized, where following those leads ‚Äì in a direct manner ‚Äì can be feasibly accomplished. For Kuwait's case, however, and because of the very distributed decision-making process made by democracy, following those leads to have an effective economic reform must have a prior political reform. =Early retirement bill= Despite the 90% government-parliament consensus on Early Retirement Bill, Al-Salloum believes such a bill should be disregarded unless there will be real political outcomes exceeding future economic losses. He sees that, if the bill passes, the Public Institution For Social Security will accelerate towards an actuarial deficit that is predicted in 2067; making it less independent and more reliant on government treasury to cover its shortages. Al-Salloum's advised that the presence of actuarial figures in governmental-parliamentary committees would fill in the gap between the two authorities in this matter. He also advised that inefficient financial management and corruption within governmental institutions must not be an excuse to pass such bills, including Loans Dropping Bill. Legislations should consider those issues instead. =Belt and road initiative= In an interview with Xinhua, Al-Salloum stated that the Belt and Road Initiative can help create jobs, increase net exports, and attract even more foreign investments, which by the end increase the overall gross domestic product. In the interview, he stated that China has the expertise, manpower and industrial and logistic production ingredients, which crave entering a market or creating a new one. Kuwait, on the other hand, according to his opinion, has a good location that can be utilized to create mutual interests for both countries. Hence, he sees cooperation with China will have a positive impact on the development in Kuwait and leads the country to be more exposed and to prompt legislations to facilitate international trade. =U.S. Chinese tariffs= In another interview with Xinhua, Al-Salloum showed his visualization of China overcoming the tariffs crisis as its products are no longer globally seen as second-class, which can be justified by the improved utilization of expertise and research and development it has. He brought up Apple as an example where products are marketed as designed in California and assembled in China.

The park has a land area of 3.4 hectares (8.4 acres) and located by the side of Krendang River, which was formally opened on 22 February 2017. The park is built after demolishing a red light area. History =Name= Kalijodo was not always been infamous for prostitution, gambling and alcohol sales. It was a neighborhood for Chinese Indonesians. During 1950's, It was also a favorite public place to roam around, as the Angke River was clean and with many trees and greenery, which in turn made the area a popular spot for young people to gather. In Indonesian, kali means ‚Äòriver‚Äô and jodoh ‚Äòmate‚Äô or ‚Äòsoulmate‚Äô. The name stemmed from a matchmaking ritual that developed as part of the Chinese Peh Cun holiday, which is the celebration of the hundredth day in the lunar calendar. One tradition in the celebration of peh cun is a water feast. During the festival youngsters would ride on boats down the river and throw bean cakes to members of the opposite sex who caught their eye while floating side by side. Conversely, if a woman accepts, she would throw back with a similar cake.Prostitusi Kalijodo Dulunya Berasal di Atas Perahu. from the news Vivanews This tradition ceased in 1958 after then Jakarta Mayor Sudiro, who served in 1953‚Äì1960, banned Chinese cultural celebrations. =Red light district= Kalijodo used to be Jakarta's oldest and biggest red-light district. The red light area was demolished on 29 February 2016. At the time of demolition there were about three hundred buildings, with more than sixty cafes and pubs. with about 3,400 population, according to data from the Jakarta administration. Kalijodo stretches between North and West Jakarta, but most of it lies in North Jakarta. Prostitution began to develop in the Kalijodo area in 1963. But according to other versions, Kalijodo was a red light area since 1600s. Many fugitives from Manchuria used to dock in Batavia. After docking they used to visit Kalijodo to find out temporary wives or concubines for a replacement of wife back at home. The prospective concubines were predominantly dominated by local women, who would attempt to attract ethnic Chinese men by singing Chinese classical songs on boats floating on the river. The woman who was to become a mistress was called Cau Bau, which was considered to have a higher status than a prostitute. Nevertheless, the location had activities with money transactions similar to Geisha concept in Japan.Sejarah Berdirinya Lokalisasi Kalijodo Sejak Era Kolonial Belanda Hingga Sebesar Sekarang. from the news idntimes.com Facilities of the Park After demolishing the red light area, the park was built with CSR funds of private companies. The park was built with concept of semi-natural green park, playground, futsal court, hall and international-standard skate park. The skate park is one of the largest in the region, and the mural ‚Äì a collaborative effort by 10 of Indonesia's top street artists. Kalijodo has turned into one of the family-friendly integrated public spaces in Jakarta, which even used as a concert venu occasionally. The park has four main areas, including a green park, a playground, an indoor football court, an amphitheater, an international-standard skate park and two supporting areas for a Betawi-style mosque and food court. *Entering the park, a child-friendly integrated public space (Ruang Publik Terpadu Ramah Anak, RPTRA) is to the right, serving as a home to young families with children. *There is an open- air function hall with a translucent roof and a void with trees planted in the center appear, allowing the breeze to come in. *The amphitheater beside the function hall surrounded by a 23-metre wall, filled by murals and graffiti done by famous Indonesian mural artists and bombers. *On the north side a brick-and-steel well monument Sumur, depicting Kalijodo in the 1950s as a place to find soulmate. It was built based on the Sanskrit philosophy of lingam-yoni that denotes sacred fertility. *The skate park includes concrete ramps, iron railings, stair-sets and is surrounded by a bicycle track. Controversy The Jakarta city government has talked of cleaning up the area for just about as long as it's existed. Cleaning up Kalijodo would take not just forceful action, but also the courage and political backing to tackle the entrenched gangs. On 9 February 2016, a 24-year-old drunk driver sped at 100 km/h after consuming ten alcoholic beverages, killing four people, landing in prison as a result for six years, spurring Jakarta city administration to finally demolish the area in a swift way. Following the demolition, human rights groups spoke out, arguing that rapid eviction violated the principles of involuntary resettlement as dictated in the UN's International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which was ratified by Indonesia in 2005 and mandates consultation with those affected and protections ensuring that no one will be left homeless or vulnerable. Indonesian National Commission on Violence Against Women (Komnas), raised particular concern over the welfare of Kalijodo's sex workers (prostitution is ostensibly illegal in Indonesia).

The aim of the event is to connect leaders of today with leaders of tomorrow. To do so, a wide range of key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and engage in discussions with students from various universities. Hereby, the symposium allows students to relate their academic insights to the broader business society.https://mypresswire.com/dk/pressroom/20561/pressrelease/53857 Aarhus Symposium was founded in 2011 and has since expanded its concept to also involve Aarhus Symposium Focus and Aarhus Symposium Challenge. Aarhus Symposium is a non-profit organisation, and all symposia are organised by voluntary students together with a pro-bono board of directors.  History  Four students at Aarhus University established Aarhus Symposium in 2011: David Scherer, Jens Riis Andersen, Kasper Vinther Olesen, and Andreas Emmertsen. They gathered support from other students to organise the very first Aarhus Symposium with the objective of building a bridge between students, i.e. the future leaders, and leaders in today's businesses and society.http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/12/3184822/artikel.html The first annual Aarhus Symposium welcomed renowned speakers from the business society such as Carsten Bjerg (then CEO of Grundfos), Lars Rohde (then CEO of ATP), and Maria R√∏nn (CEO of Danmarks Radio). Throughout the years, the programme has extended to include prominent speakers such as His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Denmark, Lars Rebien S√∏rensen (president and CEO of Novo Nordisk), and the Danish Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen. Aarhus Symposium has grown through the years as a result of wide support from students, speakers, partners, and others. In 2012, the Organising Committee introduced Battle of the Economists; an event to take place on Monday in the week of Aarhus Symposium. It provided a national focus to the overall theme of Aarhus Symposium. The event was renamed Aarhus Symposium Focus in 2016 to broaden the possibilities for topics that exceed economic issues. In 2013, Aarhus Symposium Challenge was established to strengthen the connection between students and the leaders of today. Aarhus Symposium Challenge is an essay competition in which selected speakers put forth a challenge for students to solve. Through their essay, students obtain a seat at both Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus, and they potentially qualify for Leaders‚Äô Forum. Since its initiation in 2013, an increasing number of students have participated in Aarhus Symposium Challenge, making it the primary sign-up for Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus.

It was Baltic or 4-6-4 locomotive.  Origins  The locomotive was ordered on 9 March 1936 by the Soci√©t√© nationale des chemins de fer fran√ßais in an attempt to solve the problem of the crankshaft which limited, in part, the speed of the locomotive and its inherent dynamic augment or hammer blow. The order for its construction was placed with the firm of Schneider et Cie.  Description  It was decided to equip the locomotive with a conventional high-pressure boiler and individual turbines for the axles. The boiler chosen was of the classic fire-tube type. This boiler was pressed to , the maximum pressure for this type of boiler, unlike 232.P.1 which had a water-tube boiler pressed to . The turbines, three in number, powered the driving axles via a Westinghouse- type elastic link. They has a maximum speed of 10,000 rpm at a speed of . This drive system had the advantage of dispensing with the connecting rods, thus eliminating any oscillating motion and the hammer blow on the track. Due to the absence of connecting rods, the locomotive had outside frames. It was also fitted with an integral fairing.  Service history  The locomotive was rolled out of the Schneider et Cie's Creusot factory in early June 1940, and commenced testing. However, the Battle of France quickly caused the tests to be suspended, and the locomotive went into store in the manufacturer's workshops as early as 12 June. The tests resumed later in September, before they were moved to the Vitry-sur-Seine test plant in October 1940. The first series of tests showed that the locomotive was very quiet and very stable. From 16 January 1942, the locomotive was used to haul workers' trains in the Creusot area, and regular trains between Paris and Dijon. Damage to the central turbine forced its return the manufacturer, where it survived its first bombardment without damage. Subsequently, it was moved to Laumes depot, where it survived a second bombardment unscathed. Finally, it was sabotaged by the retreating German Army in August 1944. While deemed repairable, authorisation for its restoration was refused on 8 August 1946. Authorisation for retirement was granted in April 1947, and it was stuck from the roster in January 1948.  Conclusion  The locomotive was designed to reduce the number of moving parts, and to give a smoother ride. However, the delay caused by the Second World War and the SNCF's choice of electric traction, meant that the good results obtained did not secure a future for steam traction. Parallels can be drawn with the other prototypes that finally came too late: 2-232.P.1, 3-242.A.1, and 4-160.A.1.  Tender  The tender coupled to 232.Q.1 was an ex-PLM 30.A bogie type that had a capacity of of water and of coal. It was fitted with a steam-driven coal pusher to ease the task of the fireman.

Avalon Production launched the album in Macedonia, while Croatian label Dallas Records released it throughout former Yugoslav countries in April 2015. The album consists of eight original songs written by Valentin Soklevski and Vesna Malinova; the arrangement and production were completed by Nikola Micevski and Dejan Momirovski. Except for those eight songs, two cover versions are also included, one of them being of a Macedonian traditional song and the other one of a record originally performed by Macedonian singer Pepi Baftiroski. For Goƒçeva, the motivation to record the album came from the critical and commercial success of her previous project inspired by the Macedonian traditional music, Makedonsko Devojƒçe (2008). The project's finalization lasted for two years due to the intention of the team behind it to improve it as much as possible. According to Goƒçeva and the producer Micevski, the group's members' acquaintance with each other helped them in setting the right musical direction with the recording of Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2. Musically, the album is similar to its predecessor; the songs are characterized by elements of Macedonian traditional music, but are adapted to a modern style which is contemporary at the time of the release of the album, thus intertwining pop and jazz elements. The lyrics cover emotional states of sadness, happiness, love and longing experienced by a mellow woman. The songs were written and composed specifically for Goƒçeva, taking into account her wide vocal range and musical versatility; all of them are sang without using any backing vocals. Macedonian music critics commended the album with its blend of traditional and mainstream music being particularly lauded. It also achieved wide commercial success becoming the best-selling album of 2014 in Macedonia. Three singles were released from Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2: the song \\"ƒåalgiska\\" premiered on 6 December 2013 before the album's release, \\"Dve liri (ne ni bilo pi≈°ano)\\" was released in January 2014 and \\"Koj da mi zapee\\" was released as a single in April 2015, being sent to radio stations in Macedonia and the other ex-Yugoslav countries. To promote Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2, Goƒçeva held concerts across different cities in Macedonia before and after the release of the album. Most of them were recorded and broadcast on various TV shows in the country and were uploaded and shared on the singer's social media and YouTube accounts. In 2015, the album was also promoted in Serbia. Background In 2008, Goƒçeva released the album Makedonsko Devojƒçe in collaboration with Macedonian composer Zlatko Origjanski. The album features elements of Macedonian traditional music and it represented a change in the musical style for the singer. According to Goƒçeva, the album served as an experimental work for her in order to establish whether she would be able to successfully record folk music. Makedonsko Devojƒçe turned out to be a commercial and critical success, becoming the best-selling album in Macedonia in the year of its release and receiving the award for Best World Music Album at the 2008 Sunƒçane Skale festival in Montenegro. Its popularity among the Macedonian public lasted for several years after its release.Carpe Diem - Interview with Karolina Goƒçeva. 2014. (in Macedonian). Alsat-M. After her audience's demand to continue performing similar songs, Goƒçeva decided to record a second album in the same musical direction. Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 is a successor to the album released in 2008 and it contains songs composed in the vein of Macedonian folklore. The plans to record the album were revealed by Goƒçeva during an interview in May 2012 with the magazine Na≈° Svet, confirming that she had already begun with the song selection process for the track listing of the second edition of the project Makedonsko Devojƒçe.Na≈° Svet. –ö–∞—Ä–æ–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –ì–æ—á–µ–≤–∞: \\"–°–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞ –Ω–æ–≤ –ø–æ–ø-–∞–ª–±—É–º, –∞ —Å–µ –±–∏—Ä–∞–∞—Ç –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏ –∑–∞ –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ—Ç–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ ‚Äú–ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–æ –¥–µ–≤–æ—ò—á–µ‚Äù. (in Macedonian). 22 May 2012. In the initial stages of the album's development, Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 served only as a working title and later became its official title in order to emphasize that the musical style is the same as that of Makedonsko Devojƒçe (2008). A team of renown Macedonian musicians was responsible for handling the instrumentation and arrangement of the songs from the album; some of the most influential ones include Olver Josifoski from the music group Ljubojna, Zoran Kostadinovski from Kabadajas, Bo≈°ko Mangarovski from Chalgija Sound System and Goce Uzunski from Synthesis. The album contains eight original songs written and composed by Nikola Micevski, Valentin Soklevski and Vesna Malinova. The songwriters took into account that their songs are specifically written to be performed by Goƒçeva, thus trying to make them fitting for her broad vocal range and adaptable musical performance, which can range different music genres. Two cover versions are also included on the album; the first one, \\"Te vidov i se zaljubiv\\" is a Macedonian traditional song and the second one, \\"Ako zgre≈°am neka izgoram\\", was originally sung by Pepi Baftiroski and written by Mile and Gjorgji Barbarovski. Recording and development The work on the album lasted for two years, due to the group working behind it paying attention to details and trying to record the best possible version of the material at hand, at the same time maintaining slow-paced progress. The work on the album began in 2012; after the songs were written, Micevski recorded demo versions and sent them to Goƒçeva. After she listened to them, the singer started a song selection process, choosing the most fitting ones among the numerous that were written for her. She decided recording and including ten songs on the track listing of her new album. Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 was recorded at studio XL by Dejan Momirovski in Skopje. During an interview with the portal IdiVidi, Goƒçeva explained that the group working on the album consisted of her long- time professional acquaintances, thus rendering the process of working with them easy and pleasant due to the presence of an \\"excellent atmosphere\\". The long-time collaboration and the previous experiences they have had together served as a lesson for attaining perfection, making Goƒçeva more self-confident and determined in taking a specific direction with the album. During an interview on the TV show Carpe diem on the TV channel Alsat-M in February 2014, Goƒçeva called the album her best work she had published yet. The maturity she had gained throughout her career served as an inspiration of \\"modernizing the traditional\\"; Goƒçeva said that the Macedonian folklore is something existing in the blood of the Macedonian people and added that her album was not characterized by typical traditional songs but rather songs drawing inspiration from that kind of music. Through the new tracks, she allowed her musical performance to stand out and leave a certain long-lasting contribution to Macedonian contemporary music. The singer also acknowledged that the music she had recorded for the album was not popular on a worldwide scale, but emphasized that the sound is more authentic for Macedonia as compared to other mainstream popular genres across the world such as hip hop, pop and R&B.; Micevski, the album's producer, is also one of the people who had had a long-time professional relationship with the singer and who had contributed for the arrangement of the songs included on Makedonsko Devojƒçe (2008); the start of the professional ties with Goƒçeva began when he joined her live band which performed during her concerts in the past. He said that due to the mutual understanding between the two of them, the process of setting a music direction with the album was without any difficulties, but moved slowly because of their intention to create high quality material. During an interview with the journal Republika, Micevski said that his work on Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 represented both responsibility and pressure to a certain extent. He elaborated that the requirement with the album was to create something that would resemble the first project, but will not be identical to it and would maintain the same level of quality or even surpass it. He added: \\"To me, that represented a big challenge and maybe a life chance to express myself differently, uniquely, with a different mark, with all my knowledge and spirit. It was an additional pleasure working with my close friend and collaborator Dejan Momirovski... In the end we all managed to do what we had had in mind.\\" Micevski also revealed that the songs included on the album were originally custom-made for Goƒçeva, adapted to her vocal capabilities and musical maturity, adding that she is a \\"world performer\\" and a singer who can sing in different styles: \\"She can simply find her way anywhere and she does it on a very high level. The mark she left on the material of 'Makedonsko Devojƒçe 1 and 2' is a really unique, original style of performance which leaves traces in the history of Macedonian vocal-instrumental music.\\" Composition and lyrics According to Goƒçeva, the album was meant to incorporate ethno jazz music in addition to the prominent elements of Macedonian folklore. Critics also noted elements of pop and jazz in the songs and viewed the music as an internationalization of the sound of traditional Macedonian folklore. The lyrics cover several themes with the song's motives revolving around the states of happiness, sadness, love and longing of a mature female protagonist. Instrumentally, the songs on Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 contain the following instruments: clarinet, bass guitar, horn, acoustic guitar, violin, qanun, saxophone and percussion. The album opens with the seven-minute song \\"Koj da mi zapee\\" () which expresses the grief experienced by a woman who has recently lost her beloved love interest who used to sing to her while they were together. The song's title and the lyrics \\"≈Ωedna sum, ≈æedna za poj\\" () and \\"‚Äû[E]h ≈°to mi be≈°e srceto ≈æivo, eh ≈°to si imav so nego ≈æivot\\" () illustrate feelings of longing, and sadness for her lost love and youth. The journalist Beƒçkoviƒá described it as a \\"classic in the new Macedonian ƒçalgija‚Äú. The second song from the album is \\"ƒåalgija\\" which incorporates rhyme throughout its verses and features prominent elements of ƒçalgija, a Macedonian music genre. \\"Vezi, vezi\\" (), the third song of Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 is an elegy for Macedonian migrant workers. \\"Sakam da ne te sakam\\" () speaks of an adulterous lover and is sung from the perspective of the female protagonist. She dedicates the song to her love interest so that he realizes she was \\"the one who loved him sincerely\\". \\"Smej mi se, smej‚Äú () features and ƒçalgija elements. \\"Dve liri (ne ni bilo pi≈°ano)\\" () is a song dedicated to a woman's past lover. Her grandmother has requested that the protagonist play the song during her wedding. Although the grandmother has passed way without hearing the song at her granddaughter's wedding, the latter fulfills the former's wish by paying two lire to request a song from the band playing music at the wedding of her ex-lover at which she is partaking as an invitee. \\"Ke pijam ljubov do kraj\\" () has joyful lyrics about love and according to Beƒçkoviƒá, it is musically similar to the playful rhythm typical of bossa nova as Goƒçeva is accompanied by fast horns and a double bass. In the song, the female protagonist sings about a \\"blazing kiss\\". The song \\"Son\\" () contains a \\"fairy tale-like\\" atmosphere. It describes a \\"fleeting beauty once we open our eyes\\" and how real life is different from a dream, as portrayed in the lyrics \\"Pusta ostana ≈æelba nevina, son si mina i ti si zamina... Ne znam koj e kriv, Bo≈æe daj mi zdiv\\" (). The cover versions of \\"Te vidov i se zaljubiv\\" () and \\"Ako zgre≈°am neka izgoram\\" () are characterized by arrangements which differ significantly from the original versions and rhythmically match the overall sound of the album. Release and promotion On 24 February 2014, a six-minute sampler of the album containing short excerpts of all ten songs was published on Goƒçeva's official YouTube account. The following day, the album was released in all the major shopping centers in Macedonia. All songs were available on Spotify and each of them was published with an accompanying lyric video on Goƒçeva's official YouTube account in the last days of February and the beginning of March. On 16 April 2014, the album was available for digital purchase through iTunes Store. On 26 April 2015, the album was physically released in all ex-Yugoslavian countries (Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia) through the Croatian record label Dallas records. It was one of the first albums in Macedonian released in ex-Yugoslavian countries after a longer period of time. =Live performances in Macedonia= An image of the building of the Macedonian Opera and Ballet in Skopje where Goƒçeva held five consecutive concerts to promote Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 From 20 to 24 February, Goƒçeva held five concerts at the Macedonian Opera and Ballet (MOB) during which she performed songs from Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 live for the first time. The concertgoers were the first to receive copies of the album along with their tickets which were put on sale on 9 December 2013. In 2014, 15,000 tickets were sold for Goƒçeva's concerts in Skopje. In January 2014, a listening party for the album was held at the club XO in Skopje on which Goƒçeva was also present; the event represented the first of such kind in Macedonia and according to Goƒçeva, the inspiration for it came from a similar trend popular across the world where the artist and the team working behind the album listen to the full final version of the project together with a group of fans and music journalists. On 17 February 2014, Goƒçeva appeared on the event MRT za Najdobrite (MRT for the Best) which celebrated the existence of the Macedonian radio and television. On the show, she performed her song \\"Dve liri (ne ni bilo pi≈°ano)\\" and was dressed in traditional Macedonian attire. On 21 March 2014, Macedonian Radio Television (MRT) broadcast a full performance filmed during one of the concerts where she sang various songs from Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 and its predecessor. On 12 November, the same year, Goƒçeva sang \\"Koj da mi zapee\\" at Skopje Fest at the Universal Hall and an official recording of the performance was uploaded on her YouTube account two days later.

The singer also performed in Prilep at the Pivo Fest festival on 15 July 2016, where she sang numerous songs from the album. In 2015, Goƒçeva explained in an interview that performing at the concerts where she sang songs from Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 was a challenge for her due to the great vocal effort she had to put and the lack of background vocals during the live performances. She also revealed that a band of ten musicians was specifically assembled to perform the music from the album live; it consisted of several Macedonian music academics who accompanied her on-stage. =Promotion in Serbia= In 2015, Goƒçeva started promoting the album in Serbia. On 29 May, she appeared on the sixth season of the TV show Veƒçe sa Ivanom Ivanoviƒáem where she sat down for an interview and later performed \\"Koj da mi zapee\\" and \\"Smej mi se smej\\" from the album as well as \\"Begaj, begaj\\" which was a new song published after the album's release.Episode 239.

On 11 July, she performed at the Exit Festival in Novi Sad with songs from Makedonsko Devojƒçe 1 and Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2. In the beginning of November, the singer appeared on the news on the Serbian TV channel N1 and on the TV show Dobro Jutro - Jovana & Srdjan on RTV Pink where she gave an interview about the album and her upcoming concert in Belgrade. On 7 November, the singer held a concert at the Ilija M. Kolarac Endowment in Belgrade where she performed songs from both albums to the Serbian audience.

The song \\"ƒåalgiska\\" was released as the first single from the album. It was released on 6 December 2013 on the singer's official Facebook profile and on that of Avalon Production. \\"Dve liri (ne ni bilo pi≈°ano)\\" was released as a single in Macedonia on 13 January 2014. The lyrics video of the song is the most-viewed video on the singer's YouTube account with more than 6 million views as of 2019. The song \\"Koj da mi zapee\\" was released as the album's third single in April 2015 and was sent to radio stations in Macedonian cities and countries of ex-Yugoslavia. In October 2016, English singer Joss Stone contacted Avalon Production, requesting to sing \\"Koj da mi zapee\\" together with Goƒçeva at a park in Skopje. The idea for the performance came from a series of videos that Stone filmed during her visits to various countries as part of her Total World Tour embarked in 2014. Before visiting the countries where she was scheduled to perform, Stone used YouTube to identify the most representative and popular songs and chose her favorite one. Stone had rehearsed the song before coming to Skopje and improvised along with Goƒçeva in order to bring specificity to the melody. A professionally recorded video of the performance was published on the official YouTube accounts of both Stone and Goƒçeva on 18 October 2016. The video starts with Goƒçeva explaining to Stone the meaning behind some of the lyrics of the song; afterwards they sing it together accompanied by live musicians in the background. Reception Before its release, the album was sent to music critic Ivan Beƒçkoviƒá who listened to it and wrote a review for the website Macedonian Music Net. According to him, the album was a logical step in the singer's career after the success of Makedonsko Devojƒçe (2008). He noted how both albums exhibit the \\"perfect combination - city music sang in a magical manner by a city girl\\". He noted that the lyrics of the songs were genuine and leave an impression of being someone's real past experiences, thus showcasing the singer's intention to leave a long-lasting project behind her. He added how \\"leaning to her internal instincts and needs, she elevates her power and spirituality to a higher level\\".Beƒçkoviƒá, Ivan.

Retrieved 12 August 2017. Beƒçkoviƒá also thought that the album's uniqueness lies in its combination of various musical elements which distinguish it from classical Macedonian ƒçalgija. He concluded his review, observing that at the very beginning of 2014, the Macedonian music scene had already received its album of the year. In an article published in Radio Slobodna Evropa, Ljupcho Jolevski called the album \\"magical and multilayered... an accomplishment which has an instant likability, but which you discover with each next listen\\". Jolevski praised the team responsible for the arrangement and the instrumentation for their efforts to give their best in the album's songs. He described the sound of Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 as a mixture of Macedonian folklore and the \\"ocean of worldwide sounds\\". According to Jolevski, the album elevates to an \\"amazing collection of songs which defy the ugliness of rhythms and simple lyrics which we are splashed with on a daily basis\\". At the end of his article, Jolevski concluded that Goƒçeva has reached her musical zenith and the brightest point of her career with the album characteristic of her hometown, Bitola. He concluded that the album \\"brings the sounds and customs of the Old Bazaar of Bitola, the city that even nowadays somehow resists the turbo-attacks from all sides\\". Writing for the portal Vistina, Maja Beƒákoviƒá credited the singer for conveying \\"so much warmth, so many emotions\\" in an album; she called \\"every word - a new pearl, every verse - gold, every vocal - a shining diamond\\". She continued describing the songs as \\"so authentic, so old, so archaic and yet, so modern and rich, both production and author-wise\\". The journalist observed that the lyrics were carefully selected with every track eligible for \\"a compilation containing the best lyric songs from this region, which contains so many centuries of elegy and sadness, interwoven with rare moments of joy, which make life worth living\\". She credited the singer for adding even more value to what already was valuable material arranged for the album and concluded, \\"All in all, Macedonian girl will touch your heart and spirit even for the second time\\". According to Avalon Production, Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 was the best-selling album in Macedonia in the year of its release. The songs were well received by the concertgoers in Macedonia and Serbia and were among the audience's favorites later on. During an interview with the television channel N1, Goƒçeva revealed that all the songs had become evergreens in Macedonia. When asked about her future projects and whether she would return to recording pop music as she did before the release of music inspired by Macedonian folklore as in Makedonsko Devojƒçe 1 and Makedonsko Devojƒçe 2 or she would continue in the same direction as those two albums, Goƒçeva said that \\"there is no reason why I would not make one more project like that\\".

In 1993, the drama was made into a film Kaettekita Kogarashi Monjir≈ç. Monjir≈ç is a drifter, iconic for his ragged straw hat and cape outfit and long toothpick in his mouth. His stock phrase was \\"It's nothing to do with me\\".  Plot  Kogarashi Monjir≈ç or \\"Monjir≈ç of the Wintry North Wind\\" (see ¬ßCharacters below) is a toseinin (a profession-less gambler\\"Tosei-nin „Å®„Åõ„ÅÑ‚Äê„Å´„Çì„ÄêÊ∏°‰∏ñ‰∫∫„Äë\\", Kojien, 4th ed., 1991.) in the Edo period. He travels alone. He is exiled to the island of Hachij≈ç-jima taking blame for a crime committed by a friend, but when the friend breaches the vow of silence in order to protest Mojir≈ç's innocence, it shatters his faith in people. Characters ;Kogarashi Monjir≈ç The character is known for always having a long toothpick protruding from his mouth, which sometimes served as a weapon. He wears a weather-beaten hat (type of kasa hat), and a dingy cloak. He also has a famous punch line, which was \\"Asshi ni wa kakawari no nei koto de gozansu \\"It's nothing to do with me\\" or \\"It does not concern me\\", and characterized as a \\"nihilistic gambler\\" or \\"nihilistic wandering outlaw hero\\". He is a wanderer (watari-mono), and a skilled swordsman, who winds up aiding people he meets in his wayfaring journey, but he maintains he does not act out of altruism or sense of justice, but only retaliates against those who provoke his anger. Television production Film director Kon Ichikawa agreed to take the helm for the TV production partly for financial reasons, hoping to accrue enough capital to fund his cinematic works. The role of Monjir≈ç was played by then-budding actor Atsuo Nakamura. Nakamura Atsuo himself directed episode 8, second season, . Monjir≈ç, especially the TV version, has achieved folk-hero status. The TV show reached 30% rating, and resulted in the opening of the Monjir≈ç exhibit, and the sales of Monjir≈ç manj≈´ sweets and ramen noodles. The production was plagued with problems. The lead actor Nakamura injured his Achilles tendon which disrupted filming, and the series had to go into recess and the hole filled by another program. The troubled production company, also fell into bankruptcy. In 1977, Shin Kogarashi Monjir≈ç was broadcast on TV Tokyo. Other adaptations Sadao Nakajima directed the 1972 film version in which the lead role was played by Bunta Sugawara. It has also been adapted into manga by Goseki Kojima, famous for his samurai comic series Lone Wolf and Cub read not only in the United States but internationally. Analysis The wanderer who can be classed with other television and on-screen heroes like Zat≈çichi or and an academic study compares them with the Japanese folk belief in marebito, wandering spirits who help humankind.

A loot box is typically a form of monetization, with players either buying the boxes directly or receiving the boxes during play and later buying \\"keys\\" with which to redeem them. These systems may also be known as gacha (based on ‚Äì capsule toys) and integrated into gacha games. Loot box concepts originated from loot systems in massively multiplayer online role-playing games, and from the monetization of free-to-play mobile gaming. They first appeared in 2004 through 2007, and have appeared in many free-to-play games and in some full-priced titles since then. They are seen by developers and publishers of video games not only to help generate ongoing revenue for games while avoiding drawbacks of paid downloadable content or game subscriptions, but to also keep player interest within games by offering new content and cosmetics through loot-box reward systems. Loot boxes were popularized through their inclusion in several games throughout the mid-2010s. By the later half of the decade, some games, particularly Star Wars Battlefront II, expanded approaches to the concept that caused them to become highly criticised. Such criticism included \\"pay to win\\" gameplay systems that favor those that spend real money on loot boxes and negative effects on gameplay systems to accommodate them, as well as them being anti-consumer when implemented in full-priced games. Due to fears of them being used as a source in gray-market skin gambling, loot boxes began to become regulated under national gambling laws in various countries at the same time.  Design  Overwatch. Elements such as the box shaking, the flying discs with rarity indicated by color, and the final reveal, are designed to heighten the appeal of opening loot boxes. Once the process is done, the player is presented with a button to take them to the shop to buy more boxes. A \\"loot box\\" can be named several different ways, usually related to the type of game that it appears in. A \\"loot box\\", \\"loot crate\\" or \\"lockbox\\" is often applied to shooter games since one obtains new equipable outfits or gear from it. Digital card games may use the term \\"booster pack\\" following from collectible card game roots. Loot boxes are often given to players during play, for instance as rewards for leveling up their character or completing a multiplayer game without quitting. Loot boxes may also be given out through promotions outside of gameplay, such as watching certain streaming events. Players can also buy them directly, most often with real-world funds but also through in-game currency. Some loot boxes can be redeemed immediately, while redeeming others requires further consumable items dressed as \\"keys\\". Loot boxes are generally redeemed through an in-game interface which dresses the process with appealing visual and audio effects. Some such interfaces are explicitly modelled on slot machines or roulette wheels. When the player runs out of loot boxes or keys, a prominent button may be displayed with which they can buy more. The items that can be granted by a loot box are usually graded by \\"rarity\\", with the probability of receiving an item decreasing rapidly with each grade. While the set of items given are randomly selected it can come with certain guarantees, for instance that it will contain at least one item of a certain rarity or above. In some redemption processes, yet-revealed items are presented with a color that corresponds to its rarity level, further heightening the excitement of revealing the items. The player's inventory is managed in server databases run by the game's developers or publishers. This may allow for players to view the inventory of other players and arrange for trades with them. Items obtained from loot boxes and equipped or used by the player's character are nearly always visible to all other players during the course of a game, such as seeing a character skin or hearing a voice line. Most loot-box systems grant items without regard for what the player already owns. Means are provided to dispose of these duplicates, often involving trading them with other players or converting them into an in-game currency. Some loot-box systems allow players to then use this currency to directly purchase specific items they do not have. Some loot-box systems, primarily from Asian developers, use an approach adapted from gashapon (capsule toy) vending machines. These gacha games offer \\"spins\\" (analogous to turning the crank of a capsule machine) to get a random item, character, or other virtual good. One form of gacha called \\"complete gacha\\" allows players to combine common items in a set in order to form a rarer item. The first few items in a set can be rapidly acquired but as the number of missing items decreases it becomes increasingly unlikely that redeeming a loot box will complete the set. This is particularly true if there are a large number of common items in the game, since eventually one single, specific item is required. This particular practice was banned in Japan by the Consumer Affairs Agency in 2012, though gacha games at large remain. Some games may include seasonal or special event loot boxes which include specific items only available during the time of that event. In the case of digital collectible card games which rotate expansions in and out as part of keeping a viable meta-game, booster packs of a certain expansion may only be purchasable while that expansion is considered in standard play, and once it is \\"retired\\", these cards can no longer be earned in packs, though still may be gained from the use of in-game currency and used outside standard play.  History  An array of gachapon (capsule toy) machines in Hong Kong. Loot boxes were inspired by the random distribution of gachapon one could acquire through these machines. Loot boxes are an extension of randomised loot drop systems from earlier video games, frequently used to give out randomized rewards in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMO or MMORPG) or similar games. Loot boxes took this approach and formulated a monetization approach used by free-to-play games in mobile gaming. Loot boxes also incorporate elements of the randomness of acquiring gachapon capsule toys. The first known instance of a loot-box system is believed to be an item called \\"Gachapon ticket\\" which was introduced in the Japanese version of MapleStory, a side- scrolling MMORPG, in June 2004. Such tickets were sold at the price of 100 Japanese yen per ticket. Like real-life gachapon machines, players attained randomly chosen game items when they used the ticket on \\"Gachapon\\", an in-game booth that was distributed across the game world. The Chinese free-to-play game ZT Online (or simply Zhengtu) which was released in 2007 by the Zhengtu Network is also considered to be one of the early examples of video games that contained loot boxes as a part of its game system. Players in Asian countries typically do not have the funds to purchase full-cost titles, and use Internet cafes or PC bangs to play the game for free, or resort to copyright infringement to obtain copies of games for free. Instead of trying to change this approach, Asian games like ZT Online introduced loot boxes as a means to assure monetization from a game that they would otherwise not receive revenue from the base sale. Within a year, Zhengtu Network reported monthly revenue from ZT Online exceeding , justifying the profitability of this scheme. This led to the approach of releasing games as free-to-play with microtransactions atop the title. Many free-to-play mobile games in Asian regions would offer loot-box approaches, most notably Puzzle & Dragons, released in 2011, which used its gacha approach to be the first mobile game to earn more than from its monetization scheme. In Western regions (North America and Europe) around 2009, the video game industry saw the success of Zynga and other large publishers of social-network games that offered the games for free on sites like Facebook but included microtransactions to accelerate one's progress in the game, providing that publishers could depend on revenue from post-sale transactions rather than initial sale. The first appearances of loot boxes in these regions was with Team Fortress 2 in September 2010, when Valve added the ability to earn random \\"crates\\" to be opened with purchased keys. Valve's Robin Walker stated that the intent was to create \\"network effects\\" that would draw more players to the game, so that there would be more players to obtain revenue from the keys to unlock crates. Valve later transitioned to a free-to- play model, reporting an increase in player count of over 12 times after the transition, and hired Yanis Varoufakis to research virtual economies. Over the next few years many MMOs and multiplayer online battle arena games (MOBAs) also transitioned to a free-to-play business model to help grow out their player base, many adding loot-box monetization in the process, with the first two being both Star Trek Online and The Lord of the Rings Online in December 2011. Separately, the FIFA series from Electronic Arts (EA) included a \\"FIFA Ultimate Team Mode\\" that allowed players to use virtual trading cards to build a team. Initially released as downloadable content, the \\"FIFA Ultimate Team Mode\\" transitioned to a free add-on to the base game with the 2010 release, with the ability to buy card packs as a means to generate revenue for the game. EA took the success of this transition for Mass Effect 3, which is considered the first packaged game to offer a form of loot box at its launch, in March 2012. Mass Effect 3 offered \\"packs\\" that would offer uncommon gear, otherwise obtainable only by \\"grinding\\" through online gameplay. According to the game's producer Jesse Houston, these were used as a means to offset the development cost of the game's multiplayer mode. The Mass Effect 3 team worked closely with the FIFA team to get the rollout of these packs right, which Houston compared to opening a Magic: The Gathering booster card pack to make a player feel like they were always getting value from the pack. Other early examples of packaged games with loot boxes included Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in August 2013, adding \\"weapon cases\\" in an update, and Battlefield 4 in October 2013, adding \\"battlepacks\\", though they did not become purchasable until May 2014 and never granted duplicate items. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, released in November 2014, included \\"supply drops\\" that contained randomized items including different variants of the game's weapons, character gear, and experience points that could be used to customize one's character. With the financial success of Overwatch and its loot-box systems, several games in 2016 and 2017 included the mechanic as part of its meta-game, including Call of Duty, Halo 5: Guardians, Battlefield, League of Legends, Paragon, Gears of War 4, and FIFA 17. By late 2017, a large number of core AAA games from key franchises released near this time, including Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Forza Motorsport 7 and NBA 2K18, with varying mechanics in their loot-box systems, led to critical review of the practice starting in October 2017. In particular, the highly-visible Star Wars Battlefront II, released amid criticism of its loot-box systems in November 2017, led to renewed discussions at various government levels related to the legality of these systems. The review aggregator OpenCritic announced plans to include a \\"business model intrusiveness\\" for games that provide a metric on how much a game's loot and DLC system can impact the game. The reaction to loot boxes in the last half of 2017 was considered one of the major trends in the video game industry in 2017. Due to reactions to loot boxes starting in late 2017, some developers and publishers have pulled loot boxes from their games. Such games include Star Wars Battlefront II (described in depth below), Middle-Earth: Shadows of War, and Forza Motorsport 7. While many games still use loot box mechanics, new approaches to monetization have been developed, particularly the use of challenge-based battle passes stemming from Fortnite Battle Royale. In March 2019, Heroes of the Storm removed the ability to buy loot boxes with real money. Loot boxes with random content are still available as free in-game rewards, but, after the March patch, cosmetic options are available for direct purchase with real money as well. Criticism = Player investment and gambling concerns = Loot boxes are considered part of the compulsion loop of game design to keep players invested in a game. Such compulsion loops are known to contribute towards video game addiction and are frequently compared to gambling addiction. This is in part due to the use of a \\"variable-rate reinforcement schedule\\" similar to how slot machines dole out prizes. While many players may never invest real-world money in a loot-box system, such addictive systems can bring large monetary investments from \\"whales\\", players who are willing to spend large amounts of money on virtual items. Gambling concerns are heightened in games that offer loot boxes and are known to be played by children. Video games have generally been considered games of skill rather than games of chance and thus are unregulated under most gambling laws, but researchers from New Zealand and Australia, writing in Nature Human Behaviour, concluded that \\"loot boxes are psychologically akin to gambling\\". Proponents for the use of loot boxes have countered complaints that they are gambling systems by likening them to opening collectible toys such as Hatchimals or booster packs from physical collectible card games (CCGs) like Magic: the Gathering. In the United States CCGs have been subject to previous legal challenges related to if they are a form of gambling, but were not found liable. Some countries like Belgium have specifically exempted CCGs from gambling legislation because these games do not offer any type of gambling element. However, opponents of loot boxes address the fact that the process of opening a digital loot box is designed around a sensory experience and immediate return that can affect those that may be prone to gambling, a factor that does not exist with physical booster packs. Some have argued the increased use of loot boxes in games since Overwatch was due to the perception that the act of opening loot boxes is an exciting element for a game for both the player, and those watching the player either on YouTube videos or through live streaming, creating a number of multi-million subscriber video streams solely dedicated to opening loot boxes. NPD Group, which tracks video game sales, says that for games released through September 2017, there was no sign of consumer purchase change, positively or negatively, on games that included loot boxes. NPD reported that NBA 2K18, which had been criticized by players for its loot-box system at its September 2017 launch, ended up as the best- selling game in North America for that month. Juniper Research estimated that the global video game market, worth around in 2017, is set to grow to about by 2022, buoyed by the increased use of loot boxes, particularly within China. For these reason, some developers see loot boxes as an essential means to monetize games, knowing that there will always be players willing to buy these even if most others do not. Games with randomized in-game rewards, including those from loot boxes, and which offer the means to trade these items with other players, are known to attract the use of skin gambling. In skin gambling, these customization items, \\"skins\\", become a black market virtual currency among players and operators of websites that allow players to trade the items for real-world funds, or to use those items to gamble on esports or other games of chance; subsequently these activities have been identified as gambling by legal authorities, and several legal challenges arose in the last half of 2016 to stop this practice. Valve's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, updated in 2013 to include randomized loot drops from in-games, has been the most visible example of skin gambling by mid-2016. Several games which followed in 2016 and onward that used loot boxes or other randomized rewards, including Rocket League and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, did not include the ability to trade items or placed limits on trades, thus eliminating skin gambling from these games. = Impact on game design = Some loot-box systems within free games are criticized as \\"pay-to-win\\" systems, and may be derogatorily referred to as \\"pay-to-loot\\". In these cases, the contents of the loot box contain items, beyond superficial customization options, which directly affect gameplay, such as booster packs for a digital collectible card game, and with the impact on gameplay proportional to the item's rarity. This can tie the quality of a player's ability to compete with others to the random generation systems of the loot pack, and may drive players into paying for additional loot boxes to obtain high-rarity items to fairly compete with others. Blizzard's digital card game Hearthstone, released in 2014, is frequently considered to require financial investment in booster packs to be a successful player. Some commentators expressed concern that for these types of loot-box models to be successful for the publishers, the game itself has to be designed around promoting and encouraging the player to purchase loot boxes, which fundamentally impacts core game design principles and may weaken the underlying game mechanics. This may include the use of loot boxes as a means to bypass the need to grind missions repeatedly to get gameplay-changing items that significantly help towards completing a single-player game, which drives players to use real money to purchase these to avoid the time sink. For example, Middle-earth: Shadow of War has a second, true ending requiring the player to gain many more stronger allies to meet its higher difficulty. While the developers playtested the balance of the game without the loot-box system activated, assuring the game could be completed without additional monetization, reviewers found that the game required a great deal of time needed to complete numerous additional missions for the chance to acquire stronger allies, and with the consistent presence of the in-game market for loot boxes, made it difficult to avoid the allure of paying real money to bypass this grinding, creating a negative on the overall experience. The presentation of a storefront within a game which allows one to use real-world funds to purchase loot boxes or other equipment can also impact the sense of immersion a player has with a game. By July 2018, the developers of Shadow of War had released patches that completely removed the in-game storefront and loot-box system. = Incentives for monetization = The implementation of some loot-box systems are considered anti-consumer by some players and commentators. Full-priced games which already provide downloadable content and then include a loot-box system have been heavily criticized by players. Some gaming journalists identify the inclusion of loot boxes in multiplayer games as a justified part of the publisher's cost for maintaining the game servers, but see their use in single-player games as only a means for the publishers to profit. Developers and publishers consider loot boxes part of a necessary process of monetizing AAA video games beyond their initial sale. Publishers have been hesitant of raising the base price of AAA games beyond (as of 2017) for fear of immediately losing sales, and instead seek post-release revenue streams to cover the increased costs and pace of the development process, the stagnation in growth in video game audiences, and a shortening window of time in which to gain full-price sales of their games after release. Monetization schemes like loot boxes can help provide long tail revenue, well after the release of the game. Post-release monetization is believed by publishers to be necessary to compete with the mobile gaming sector, which predominately uses free-to-play monetization schemes. An analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets, in the wake of the Star Wars Battlefront II controversy, said that the price of video games, even with added purchases for loot boxes and micro-transactions, remains lower than other forms of media on a per-hour basis, and that games are generally underpriced for what value they give. Developers noted that the decision to include loot boxes in a game, and how they will be priced in real- world funds, may come from their publisher or upper management, but the implementation of their mechanics, including what they include, how they are doled out, and the like, are frequently set by the developers themselves. Some developers argue that the loot-box approach can mesh well with certain types of games, as long as they are not implemented to be a predatory manner towards consumers, and the decision to implement loot boxes within a game may be chosen by the developers rather than a mandate from the publisher. When the loot-box systems are used principally as a means to gain post-sales revenues rather than as an incentive to continuing playing the game, developers feel this requires them to significantly alter the game design away from challenge in gameplay and onto getting players to spend money. They found that games where the baseline gameplay does not encourage or require spending money for loot boxes, the addition of new content obtained from loot boxes is generally celebrated within that community and may gain brief revenue from that. Further, loot-box systems are generally better handled when their use is determined early in development so the developers can design around it, rather than a last-minute addition. Developers found that the mechanics of loot boxes are more accepted by non-Western audiences and younger Western audiences, where these groups have developed different consumption patterns than older Western players, particularly as a result of growing up playing free-to-play mobile titles. = Specific examples = Overwatch Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch loot box implementation does not impact gameplay, but other aspects of the system are subject to criticism. A free crate is given to the player each time the player reaches enough experience to level- up, but the rate of experience acquisition varies with player skill. While any item contains only cosmetic appeal and has no influence on gameplay, the desire for a specific item creates a strong incentive to purchase additional crates. Overwatch producer Jeff Kaplan detailed the desire to create an in- game currency allowing players to directly acquire an item independent of luck or skill, but currency is only given to a player after opening a crate. Overwatch software-as-a-service model delivers continued revenue as Blizzard adds new items to obtain through loot boxes. In response to criticism, Blizzard has made adjustments to its loot box system; for example, reducing the frequency of obtaining duplicate items from loot boxes while attempting to maintain the same in-game currency earning rate in June 2017. Blizzard's CEO Mike Morhaime said that with Overwatch loot boxes, Blizzard avoided inclusion of pay-to-win, gameplay-changing elements and the ability to convert rewards from loot boxes back into real-world money, and thus \\"don't think Overwatch belongs in that [loot box] controversy\\". Industry analyst Michael Pachter speculated that the loot box model of Overwatch that uses only cosmetic items will become the more preferred method of offering this monetization in the future. Despite this, Overwatch system still does not allow players to directly use real-world funds to purchase a specific cosmetic item, and the rate which they earn in-game currency towards loot boxes can be slow, both aspects which contribute towards in-game spending and the potential for gambling. Star Wars Battlefront II Conversely, Electronic Arts's Star Wars Battlefront II, developed by EA DICE studio and released in November 2017, received heightened attention in the wake of the October 2017 loot-box criticism. Principally an online multiplayer shooter, Battlefront II was developed to eliminate the \\"season pass\\" approach that the original 2015 game had used, which was found to have split the player base over those that paid for the added content and those that did not. Instead, Battlefront II brought in other micro-transaction schemes that would still allow all players to play together but provided the desired revenue streams for EA. These schemes include a loot-box system providing, among other rewards, \\"Star Cards\\" that provide boosts to a specific character class, and which have tiered levels tied to rarity that provide greater boosts. Because these higher-tier Star Cards give direct advantages to players willing to acquire many loot boxes with real money than at the rate one would obtain simply playing the game, its loot-box system at the time of its open beta period had been described as one of the more egregious \\"pay-to-win\\" systems for a full-price game. EA did re- evaluate this approach in response to criticism, and prior to full release, reworked the loot-box system so that some items still offered in loot boxes like Star Cards could also be earned through other routes such as in-game achievements, in-game currency, or through direct monetary purchase. Just prior to release, members of EA Access that had early access to the release version of Battlefront discovered that its other in-game currency and micro- transaction systems required players to spend numerous hours in game matches to earn credits at a sufficient rate to unlock special hero characters, or alternatively spend real-world funds to buy in-game currency or loot boxes that offered that currency as a possible reward. The combined loot-box and micro-transaction systems, all elements of \\"pay to win\\" schemes, drew even more criticism. Just hours before the game's official launch, EA and DICE temporarily disabled all micro-transaction purchases until they figured out a way to offer these systems in a favorable manner for consumers; DICE stated: \\"We will now spend more time listening, adjusting, balancing, and tuning\\" before they are reintroduced. According to The Wall Street Journal, the decision to remove the micro-transactions just before launch was demanded by Disney, which owns the Star Wars properties. Disney, knowing the franchise draws in younger players, feared the loot-box systems would contribute towards gambling behavior in children. EA later affirmed its revamped approach to micro-transactions within the game to be released in March 2018, eliminating any pay-to-win elements like Star Cards as potential rewards from loot boxes: Star Cards would otherwise only be earned by an experience-point-based progression in the game, while loot crates would be limited to only cosmetic items or in-game credits to buy these items. The player reaction to Battlefront loot-box system led to the Belgian Gambling Commission to evaluate the nature of loot boxes specifically in Battlefront. In the United States, it generated legislative debates about a potential sales ban within Hawaii and some other US states. EA has stated that they do not consider the approach of loot boxes in Battlefront as gambling, as it is strictly an optional feature. The reaction and change to the loot box/monetization scheme caused sales of Battlefront to fall from expectations, and EA's stock lost 8% of its value a week after the game's release (equal to about ). Analysts expect that EA will have to re-evaluate how they monetize games in the future to avoid similar backlashes, which may further reduce future revenues. In its fiscal quarter results following the release of Battlefront II, EA reported missing their sales mark of 10 million units by about 10%, which EA CFO Blake Jorgensen attributed to the loot-box controversy over the game. This, coupled with the removal of micro-transactions from the game while they readdressed the loot- box approach, led to the game missing EA's revenue projections for that quarter. In April 2018, EA's Patrick S√∂derlund stated that the loot-box controversy over Battlefront impacted the company significantly, which included a reorganization of executive positions, and that: \\"For games that come next, for Battlefield or for Anthem, [players have] made it very clear that we can‚Äôt afford to make similar mistakes. And we won‚Äôt.\\"  FIFA  Electronic Arts also published the FIFA series of association football games in annual installments, using the appearances and attributes of the real-world athletes in the teams on the league. Part of more recent entries in the system include its \\"Ultimate Team\\" mode, where players can form their own teams by collecting \\"cards\\" of these players, which have been offered through virtual card packs that can be purchased with in-game currency or real-world funds (Points currency). While this is a similar mechanism to other games using loot box mechanics, the use here is criticized due to the fact that cards earned from one version of the game do not carry over into the next year's version. Thus, players must work to regain a competitive team by re-earning in-game credits or spending more money by buying additional points, with the potential to continue that cycle each year. EA has since implemented Ultimate Team-like mechanics in other sports simulation series, including Madden NFL, NBA Live, NHL, and UFC. In 2016, EA reported that revenue from Ultimate Team pack purchases was a year, roughly half of their total revenue from microtransactions across their portfolio, and 30% of their entire digital sales revenue.  Regulation and legislation  Because of their use of random chance to gain items after committing real-world funds, games using loot boxes may be considered a form of gambling. While gambling laws vary from country to country, a common theme that tends to distinguish loot boxes from gambling is the inability to transform the contents from a loot box back into real-world money by legitimate means within the video game. Games with loot-box systems have become subject to regulation in several Asian countries, while questions of the legality of loot boxes are under consideration in some Western ones. Steven Wright for PC Gamer observed that several of the concerns for loot boxes related to gambling had been previously experienced through lawsuits in the 1990s against the baseball card industry as well as with the physical Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, but these cases did not impact either arena to a significant degree. = Asia and Oceania =  China  In December 2016, China's Ministry of Culture announced legislation which required \\"online game publishers\\" to publicly release from May 2017 onwards the \\"draw probability of all virtual items and services\\". When the law came into effect publishers complied, resulting in a variety of statistics being released which quantified the odds of Chinese players receiving different categories of item from each loot box, some of which were as low as 0.1%. Other changes mandated by the new regulations required publishers to limit the number of loot box purchases any player can purchase in a day (including limiting the size of multiple loot box bundle packages), and requiring the publisher to giver more favorable odds to the player to get rare items with the number of loot boxes they have opened, effectively assuring a player of receiving a rare item by opening a fixed number of loot boxes. The law also banned game publishers from directly selling \\"lottery tickets\\" such as loot boxes. In June 2017, Blizzard Entertainment announced that, \\"in line with the new laws and regulations\\", loot boxes in their game Overwatch would no longer be available for purchase in China. Players would instead buy in-game currency and receive loot boxes as a \\"gift\\" for making the purchase. Effective November 2019, China's General Administration of Press and Publication prohibited the sale of loot boxes to users under eight years of age and restricted their sale to older users under 18 years of age to a maximum monthly spending limit ranging from 200 renminbi to 400 renminbi.  Japan  Following the success of the gacha model from Puzzle & Dragons in 2011, it became recognized in Japan that the system was essentially gambling, particularly for younger players. By May 2012, Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency banned the practice of \\"complete gacha\\", in which a predetermined set of items gained from loot boxes would combine once completed to form a rarer and thus more valuable item. This was done not by introducing any new legislation, but by issuing a legal opinion that virtual items could be considered \\"prizes\\" under existing legislation written in 1977 to prevent the complete gacha practice in the context of baseball trading cards. Within a month of the opinion being issued, all major Japanese game publishers had removed complete gacha rules from their games, though many developers found ways around these rules. Japanese mobile game developers, including GREE and DeNA, worked to establish a self-regulating industry group, the Japan Social Game Association, which was an attempt to coerce developers from these models, but it did not prove successful, and the Association was disbanded by 2015.  South Korea  In March 2015, members of South Korea's National Assembly, led by the Liberty Korea Party, proposed amendments to the country's existing games industry regulation that would require games companies to release \\"information on the type, composition ratio, and acquisition probability\\" of items granted by loot boxes. Though the amendment did not pass, it led to attempts by the South Korean games industry to self-regulate. This has not convinced assembly members, who have continued to propose statutory regulation. However, there have been several revisions to the self- regulation (most recently, in July 2018), which now requires all video games to clearly display the payout rates of the items from the loot boxes to the player.http://kgames.or.kr/regulation There are also plans in the near future to expand the scope of this regulation to include other in-game purchases, such as the success rate of a paid consumable item whose purpose is to enhance another virtual item. The Fair Trade Commission still oversees consumer issues related to loot boxes and video games; in April 2018, it issued a fine against Nexon related to its game Sudden Attack for deceptive loot-box practices, as well as two smaller fines to other companies.  Singapore  In October 2014, Singapore's parliament passed The Remote Gambling Act, which introduced a ban on unlicensed gambling websites and fines for anyone violating it. The law's definition of gambling included staking \\"virtual credits, virtual coins, virtual tokens, virtual objects or any similar thing that is purchased...in relation to a game of chance\\", leading to concerns that it would require producers of any game in which players paid money and received a randomised outcome to seek a license to operate from the government. In response to games industry lobbying home affairs minister S. Iswaran clarified the law in parliament, stating that \\"the Bill does not intend to cover social games in which players do not play to acquire a chance of winning money and where the game design does not allow the player to convert in-game credits to money or real merchandise outside the game\\". The minister also specifically excluded platforms which offered \\"virtual currencies which can be used to buy or redeem other entertainment products\\", such as Steam, from the provisions of the bill. However the minister also said: > The fact is that the line between social gaming and gambling is increasingly > becoming blurred. What may appear benign today can quickly morph into > something a lot more sinister tomorrow in response to market opportunities > and consumer trends. That is why the legislation is cast broadly.  Australia  Within Australia, games with loot boxes would fall under gambling restrictions if they can be played \\"for money or anything else of value\\"; the question remains if items that only exist within game have \\"value\\" that can be quantified, even if this is related to an item's prestige. The Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation has stated that it considers loot boxes to be gambling, but does not have the authority to prosecute companies registered overseas. The commission has suggested \\"an immediate R rating\\" for any games which feature loot boxes as a solution to this limitation. In March 2018, the Australian Office of eSafety published a list of safety guidelines on the dangers of online loot boxes. The Australian Senate passed a motion, led by Jordon Steele-John, in June 2018 directing the Environment and Communications References Committee investigate loot boxes and report back to the Senate in September 2018. The investigation, which started in August 2018, evaluated the use of loot boxes in video games and considered them under issues related to gambling and effects on children. The report, released in mid-September 2018, found that loot boxes are \\"psychologically akin to gambling\\", and that games with loot boxes are potentially \\"exploiting gambling disorders among their customers\\". The Committee recommended that games with loot boxes be labeled to warn of parental guidance and indicate that they contain \\"in-game gambling content\\" and suggest that such games be rated to represent the legal gambling age in the country. In the final report, the Committee urged the Australian government to \\"undertake a comprehensive review of loot boxes in video games\\" through a multi-departmental effort to determine what legislative and other actions need to be taken. A February 2020 report from the Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs that focused on Internet content that should be blocked behind age verification gates recommended that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner or similar body \\"report to the Australian government on options for restricting access to loot boxes and other simulated gambling elements in computer and video games to adults aged 18 years or over, including through the use of mandatory age verification\\". By August 2020, the Australian Classification Board had updated it regulations that games with any microtransaction, including loot boxes, must be labeled on its cover as containing \\"in-game purchases\\" as part of the ratings classification.  New Zealand  The Gambling Commission within the Department of Internal Affairs for New Zealand stated, in response to a citizen's email, that currently in their view \\"loot boxes do not meet the legal definition of gambling\\", but are reviewing the situation as it progresses. = Europe =  United Kingdom  In March 2017, the UK's Gambling Commission issued a position paper \\"Virtual currencies, esports and social casino gaming\\". The paper took the position that virtual items are \\"prizes\\", and that, in general \\"Where prizes are successfully restricted for use solely within the game, such in-game features would not be licensable gambling\\". However, the paper continues that: > In our view, the ability to convert in-game items into cash, or to trade > them (for other items of value), means they attain a real world value and > become articles of money or money‚Äôs worth. Where facilities for gambling are > offered using such items, a licence is required in exactly the same manner > as would be expected in circumstances where somebody uses or receives casino > chips as a method of payment for gambling, which can later be exchanged for > cash. In August 2017, the commission opened an investigation into skin gambling. Later, in November, the commission's executive director Tim Miller was interviewed on BBC Radio 4 where he confirmed that the commission had also been investigating loot boxes and suggested self-regulation of the games industry. The Commission issued a statement that month recognising that they cannot make the determination when loot boxes crosses over into gambling, as that they can only enforce what Parliament has issued as the law for gambling, and restating the legal definition of gambling in this regards from their earlier position paper. Miller said while they cannot take action toward loot boxes until Parliament changes the law, they can raise awareness of issues with loot boxes that might affect children and their parents, and are trying to evaluate the risks and issues associated with that as part of their August 2017 skin gambling investigation. Miller further stated that even if other countries were to pass laws or regulate loot boxes, the Commission would still need to follow UK's laws. In October 2017, a month prior to the Battlefront II controversy, MP Daniel Zeichner of Cambridge, on behalf of a constituent, submitted a written parliamentary question \\"to ask the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), what steps she plans to take to help protect vulnerable adults and children from illegal gambling, in-game gambling and loot boxes within computer games\\". In response, MP Tracey Crouch, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Department, referred back to the stance of the Gambling Commission's position paper, and said that: > The government recognises the risks that come from increasing convergence > between gambling and video games. The Gambling Commission is keeping this > matter under review and will continue to monitor developments in the market. Separately, over 10,000 UK citizens signed a petition requesting that the UK government \\"adapt gambling laws to include gambling in video games which targets children\\", which includes issues over loot boxes. The government's response stated that the Video Standards Council is in discussions with Pan European Game Information (PEGI) to determine if there are any changes needed in the PEGI standards in relationship to gambling in games, and that the Gambling Commission is also considering the interaction between these games and younger players. The response also referenced the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 law which, according to the response \\"includes a requirement on businesses not to subject anyone to misleading or aggressive marketing practices, or, for example, direct exhortation to buy products, such as games content, including in-game purchases such as loot boxes\\". In March 2018, MP Anna Turley of Redcar asked the government to \\"bring forward legislative proposals to regulate the game mechanics of loot boxes\\". In response Minister of State MP Margot James said that \\"PEGI informs consumers purchasing products from major app stores if they contain further purchases and are considering the possibility of placing these notifications on boxed products\\", and that \\"regulators such as PEGI and the Gambling Commission are speaking to industry to ensure that those who purchase and play video games are informed and protected\\". The Gambling Commission issued a report in November 2018 on the state of gambling and its effect on youth. While news outlets had stated that the Commission determined that loot boxes can be considered a gateway for youths to undertake gambling in other scenarios beyond video games, the Commission clarified that they had not made any direct conclusion, and only found that about 3 in 10 children in the UK have opened loot boxes in games. Starting in January 2019, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport of the House of Commons opened up public input on how immersive technology like virtual reality may impact culture, with a specific focus on \\"the addictive nature of some technologies\\". The Department has also held public hearings with members of the video game industry to solicit their input. MP Margot James, the current Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, stated in these discussions that the UK's approach to how they treat loot boxes will likely be different from how other European states like Belgium have done, as the countries do not share similar laws for other gambling activities. James said \\"Loot boxes are a means of people purchasing items, skins, to enhance their gaming experience, not through an expectation of an additional financial reward. And also, more importantly, they can't be traded offline for money. So I think there are big differences, and I don't think really it is true to say loot boxes are gambling.\\" The Gambling Commission issued a statement in July 2019 that they cannot oversee the sale of loot boxes in most video games as there is no way to monetize the items within the loot box, a core distinction from gambling as written in current legislation. The Commission did caution that there are third-party sites that enable the means to monetize loot box items, similar to skin gambling, but they are not in a position to monitor those sited, and urged companies like Valve to take better steps to prevent skin gambling monetization. In its final report, published 9 September 2019, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport recommended that the UK government take precautionary steps to prevent the sale of games containing loot boxes to minors, and to work with PEGI to make sure that games with loot boxes are labeled as having gambling mechanics. Further, the report stated that \\"We consider loot boxes that can be bought with real-world money and do not reveal their contents in advance to be games of chance played for money's worth.\\" and urged the government to add games containing loot boxes as regulated under the Gambling Act 2005, which would restrict their sale. The report also agreed with the conclusions of the Gambling Commission that game publishes and developers must take more steps to limit the grey market of skin gambling. The Children's Commissioner for England came out with a report the following month echoing the same concerns, that loot boxes are akin to gambling for minors, and encouraged updates to gambling laws to reflect how games may use them to draw minors to continue to spend money. The National Health Service director of mental health Claire Murdoch stated in January 2020 that the Service was incorporating concerns related to loot boxes and the mental health of youth into their Long Term Plan, but cautioned that \\"no company should be setting kids up for addiction by teaching them to gamble on the content of these loot boxes. No firm should sell to children loot box games with this element of chance, so yes those sales should end.\\" In June 2020, the Department of DCMS began requesting evidence from game companies related to loot boxes as part of a further investigation. The House of Lords Gambling Committee released a special report on the state of gambling in the UK on July 2, 2020. The report identified the ongoing issue of loot boxes, how they may be seen as gambling and their effect on the youth,\\" and concluded that \\"Ministers should make regulations under section 6(6) of the Gambling Act 2005 specifying that loot boxes and any other similar games are games of chance, without waiting for the Government‚Äôs wider review of the Gambling Act.\\" In February 2017, the Isle of Man's Gambling Supervision Commission updated their regulations to explicitly define virtual items as being \\"money's worth\\" even when not convertible into cash, explicitly bringing loot boxes under statutory regulation.  Netherlands  In April 2018, the Dutch Gaming Authority issued a legal opinion that games which both sell loot boxes and permit the \\"transfer\\" of yielded items are illegal. In its report \\"Study into loot boxes: A treasure or a burden?\\", the authority stated that four games of the ten it studied violated gambling law in this way. It concluded that while the loot-box systems in the six remaining games did not meet the threshold for legal action, they \\"nevertheless foster[ed] the development of addiction\\" and were \\"at odds\\" with the authority's objectives. The authority gave the developers of the four unnamed games eight weeks to correct their loot-box system or face fines and potential bans on sales of the games in the Netherlands. Valve disabled the ability for players to trade in- game items from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, and Dota 2, stating that they were told by the Dutch Gaming Authority that they had until June 20, 2018 to remedy the loot-box situations within these games. On July 11, 2018 Valve re-enabled the ability for players to trade in-game items from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but restricted customers from the Netherlands and Belgium from opening loot boxes. The authority's investigation was opened following a parliamentary question tabled by MP Michiel van Nispen in November 2017. Announcing the investigation, the regulator warned of the \\"possible dangers\\" of \\"addiction and large financial expenses\\". Following its April announcement, the Gaming Authority began to solicit other European Union countries to help harmonize their ruling on loot boxes among the Union. In April 2019, Psyonix disabled the ability for players in the Netherlands (and Belgium) to open loot crates with keys in Rocket League due to government regulations.  Belgium  Minister of Justice Koen Geens has led some of the country's decisions on restricting loot boxes and seeks to extend Belgium's approach to all of Europe. In April 2018, shortly after the Netherlands' decision on loot boxes, the Belgian Gaming Commission completed its study of loot-box systems in four games, FIFA 18, Overwatch, Counter- Strike: Global Offensive and Star Wars Battlefront II, and determined that the loot-box systems in FIFA 18, Overwatch, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive were considered games of chance and subject to Belgium's gambling laws. The Commission stated that for loot boxes in Overwatch, the action of opening a loot box is a game of chance to receive items of some perceived value to players, and there is no means to directly purchase in-game currency to obtain a specific item, while games like FIFA 18 merge reality and fantasy by using real-life athletes to promote the loot-box system. Belgium's Minister of Justice Koen Geens stated in these findings that ‚ÄúA dialogue with the sector is necessary\\" and that \\"It is often children who come into contact with such [loot box] systems and we cannot allow that\\". The study was conducted starting in November 2017, during which Battlefront II had temporarily removed loot boxes, so was not considered in violation. The Commission ordered that the loot-box systems from these three games be removed, or otherwise the publishers could face criminal offenses and fines up to . Geens called for a European Union-wide ban of loot boxes, saying that \\"mixing gambling and gaming, especially at a young age, is dangerous for the mental health of the child\\". In response to the announcement, several companies made their games with loot boxes unavailable to customers in Belgium with no financial recourse to customers who bought or paid for merchandise in the games: * Valve said that they were \\"happy to engage with the Belgian Gambling Commission and answer any questions they may have\\". EA and Activision Blizzard declined to comment. As described above for the Netherlands, a patch to Counter Strike: Global Offensive in July 2018 prevented players from Belgium or the Netherlands from opening loot boxes. * 2K Games modified NBA 2K to comply with the ruling by removing the ability to buy MyTeam random card packs with real- world funds for Belgian players, though they can still be purchased through in-game currency. 2K still asserted that loot boxes did not violate Belgium's gambling laws, and encouraged players to contact their local representatives regarding these removals. * Blizzard Entertainment will block Belgian players of Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm from buying loot boxes, though they can still earn these through in-game rewards. * ArenaNet disabled Belgium users from purchasing in-game currency with real-world funds from Guild Wars 2. While the game does not have loot boxes, it does have \\"Ecto Gambling\\" that allows players to use in-game currency to obtain random selections of items, which would similarly run afoul of Belgium gambling laws as they found for loot boxes. * Square Enix announced the 2018 recall from app stores of three of its mobile games that include loot-box mechanics: Mobius Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts Union X, and Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia. * Konami disabled the ability for those in Belgium from purchasing in-game currency in Pro Evolution Soccer 2019, which could then be used to buy loot boxes. Players are still able to earn this currency in-game. * Simultaneously with its actions in the Netherlands in April 2019, Rocket League developer Psyonix disabled the ability for Belgium players to open loot boxes. * Nintendo closed down two of its mobile games, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp and Fire Emblem Heroes for Belgium users, as both offer the ability to use real-world money to buy a random in-game item. Electronic Arts' games FIFA 18 and FIFA 19 were also called out by the Commission, however, EA did not make any modifications to these games; EA had previously stated in May 2018 that it did not believe the implementation of loot boxes in their games constituted gambling. As such, the Commission has started actions with the Belgian courts to initiate legal action against EA by September 10, 2018, though whether such action is possible would be a decision of the public prosecutor‚Äôs office. Ultimately on January 29, 2019, EA announced that it would stop selling FIFA Ultimate Team packs with microtransactions to players in Belgium by February, bringing them into compliance with the Commission.  France  Following the controversy on loot boxes and microtransactions on release of Star Wars Battlefront II, French Senator J√©r√¥me Durain wrote to ARJEL, a government- mandated authority that oversees online gambling, to ask them to investigate the situation with pay-to-win loot boxes. Durain's letter stated his concerns that \\"some observers point to a convergence of the video game world and practices specific to gambling\\" in his request. ARJEL's report, released in June 2018, does not immediately consider loot boxes as gambling, but does address the need to continue to investigate them further following a planned report to be published by the Gaming Regulators European Forum. ARJEL noted that items from loot boxes do not normally have monetary value, and even when they are traded through skin gambling, the publisher of such games do not participate in that arena, thus distancing loot boxes from other forms of gambling.  Germany  In February 2018 Germany's announced research into loot boxes undertaken at the University of Hamburg which concluded that they present features \\"typical of gambling markets\\". Commission head Wolfgang Krei√üig said that it was \\"conceivable that loot boxes could violate the ban on advertising to children and adolescents\\". The commission concluded in March 2018 that loot boxes can possibly violate the prohibition of direct advertisement appeals to buy products directed towards minors, however, the games that they studied were rated for players of at least 16 years old, and thus were not targeted to be played by minors. The commission remained open on hearing complaints towards loot boxes on specific games, though have no legal authority to enact any fines or penalties should they be found to be against law. In October 2019, the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons (BPjM) stated it was looking into blacklisting the game Coin Master for distribution in Germany after Jan B√∂hmermann had discussed issues with the game's monetization mechanics. While Coin Master does not use loot boxes, the game uses a gameplay mechanism that requires the player to play a virtual slot machine to advance in the game, with the opportunity to use items purchased with real-world funds to influence or bypass the slot machine to achieve desirable results, a model adapted by many other games and one that can encourage or trivialize excessive gambling. If Coin Master had been blacklisted the BPjM may have opened the door for other games with similar monetization routes to be reviewed. By March 2020, BPjM opted not to blacklist the game, but later announced in July 2020 that it may consider requiring games like Coin Master and games with loot boxes to be rated at a higher ratings level under a new Youth Protection Act that is expected to be passed and in enforcement in early 2021.  Sweden  Also in February 2018, Ardalan Shekarabi, the Swedish Minister for Public Administration, stated that he was \\"ready to ask [the] authorities to take a closer look at the phenomenon of loot boxes and see if there is a need to change legislation in order to strengthen consumer protection.\\" He raised the prospect of loot boxes being classified as a lottery by 2019. Shekarabi instructed the Swedish Consumer Agency in May 2019 to review consumer protection around loot boxes, particularly in how well they protect minors and children.  Poland  In February 2019 Polish Ministry of Finance issued a statement saying that loot boxes are not gambling in the light of the Polish law, although it noted that they may well constitute gambling in other jurisdictions. Polish law defines gambling very specifically, and the current definition is not applicable to loot boxes. European Union A July 2020 report prepared on behalf of the European Parliament Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCP), \\"Loot boxes in online games and their effect on consumers, in particular young consumers\\", was one of the first reports to reframe loot boxes as a matter of consumer protection rather than a gambling concern. The report identified that loot boxes in video games have \\"problematic design features\\" that create an \\"irresistible urge to play\\" and a \\"growing tension that could only be relieved by playing\\" in an addictive loop. While the report identified this had similarities with gambling, the authors also urged that the European Parliament consider the loot box issue at a consumer protection standpoint since it can create addictive behavior particularly in young persons. The report included recommendations such as restrictions on design features that encourage the addictive loop, better disclosure from publishers to players on loot box odds and the risks of playing such games, parental controls, and consumer testing with governmental oversight. = North America =  United States  There are presently no laws in the United States targeting loot boxes, though the renewed interest in the issues with skin gambling from mid-2016 highlighted several concerns with using virtual items for gambling purposes. In past case law, courts have ruled that gambling with virtual currency within a video game is not illegal as long as there are no ties to real money, steps Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games have done with their titles. Further, most states define gambling laws based on receiving something of value from paying for a game of chance, and traditionally, in- game items are considered to have no value in previous case law. However, with more technically-literate court judges that may consider \\"value\\" more than just a financial value, alongside new perception of how much value in-game items can have resulting from the skin gambling situation, could change how the framework in the United States would classify loot boxes. Hawaii state representatives Chris Lee and Sean Quinlan issued a statement in November 2017 taking a stance against loot boxes. \\"These kinds of lootboxes and microtransactions are explicitly designed to prey upon and exploit human psychology in the same way casino games are so designed.\\" They plan to introduce legislation in the State of Hawaii, specifically to block sale of Star Wars Battlefront II, and that they have spoken to lawmakers from other states to enact similar laws, such that federal legislation could be possible if enough states take action. Quinlan stated: > I realized just how bad it has gotten. We‚Äôve been on this path for 15 years > with day-one DLC, subscription passes, pay-to-win. We as consumers kept > accepting that, kept buying those games. Now we‚Äôre at a place where we need > to consider, do we need to legislate? Does the ESRB have to consider a new > rating that could deal with gambling and addictive mechanics? Rather than passing legislation that could have a slippery slope of harmful effects on the industry, Quinlan stated he would prefer to see the industry self-regulate, either by excluding gambling-like mechanics in games marketed to children, or have the industry rate games with these mechanics for more mature audiences which would affect how they would be sold and marketed. Lee later outline how he would present a law, which would ban the sale of games to anyone under 21 if it contained a gambling element, defined if real-world funds are used to provide a \\"percentage chance\\" of receiving a specific in- game item rather than the item directly, applied both at retail and at digital distribution. By February 2018, two separate bills were introduced in Hawaii's state legislature: one bill would require retail games featuring loot-box mechanisms to have clear labeling stating \\"Warning: contains in-game purchases and gambling-like mechanisms which may be harmful or addictive.\\", while a second bill would regulate sale of these games to only those 21 years of age or older, the minimum age for gambling within the state. However, by March 2018, the bills failed to meet necessary requirements to be considered in the legislation, and were dropped. In January 2018, three senators in Washington state introduced Senate Bill 6266 (S-3638.1) in the state legislature, which would, if enacted, order the Washington State Gambling Commission to investigate loot boxes and their potential effect on underage gambling. Minnesota introduced a bill in April 2018 that would prohibit sale of games with loot-box systems to children under 18 years of age, and require specific labelling on these games to alert consumers to the loot-box system. In early May 2019, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri announced that he intends to introduce a bill named \\"The Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act\\" that would ban loot boxes and pay-to-win microtransactions in \\"games played by minors\\", using similar qualifications to determine this as previously defined in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. The Federal Trade Commission would be responsible for enforcing the bill by making judgements and leveling fines for games that fail to take these steps. The bill was formally introduced in the United States Senate in the 116th Congress on May 23, 2019 as Senate Bill 1629, with co-sponsors Ed Markey (Massachusetts) and Richard Blumenthal (Connecticut), both Democrats. = Multi-national = In September 2018, members from the gambling commissions from fifteen European nations, including Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, UK, as well as the state of Washington from the United States, announced a collaborative effort to \\"address the risks created by the blurring of lines between gaming and gambling\\". While the group's specific focus will be on skin gambling sites, they will be looking to \\"ensure that features within games, such as loot boxes, do not constitute gambling under national laws\\". = Self-regulation = Video game industry bodies have generally stated that they cannot regulate loot boxes as gambling unless the law of their countries specify what counts as gambling within games.  Europe  In many European countries, voluntary ratings for video games are provided by PEGI. PEGI has stated that a game having a loot-box system will not automatically require its \\"gambling content\\" descriptor. PEGI further stated that \\"It's not up to PEGI to decide whether something is considered gambling or not ‚Äì this is defined by national gambling laws\\". Parliamentary questions in the United Kingdom revealed in March 2018 that PEGI is \\"considering the possibility of placing [in-game purchase] notifications on boxed products\\". PEGI announced in April 2020 that it will add the supplementary label \\"Includes Paid Random Items\\" for games featuring loot box-like mechanics.  Japan  Before the disbanding of the Japan Social Game Association (JSGA) in 2015, it issued 2 self-regulatory guidelines for in-game gacha: provide a minimum 1% payout rate and establish a payment ceiling. For example, if a player has poured certain amount of money in gacha, the player is given a chance to choose whatever reward they want from the gacha pool freely. The association recommended a 50,000 yen ceiling. The Japan Online Game Association (JOGA), which now serves as the Japanese video game industry's self-regulatory body in lieu of JSGA, also issued similar guidelines with further specifications such as \\"listing all available rewards from the lootbox and payout rates of all rewards\\" and \\"listing changes to all available rewards and payout rates upon software revision, specifically during festive campaign with a deadline\\". While the new guideline does not recommend any payment ceiling, it recommends to display the expected maximum bet in order to guarantee obtaining the item if it exceeds 50,000 yen.  United Kingdom  UKIE, the video game industry trade organization for the United Kingdom, asserted its stance that loot boxes do not constitute gambling and are \\"already covered by and fully compliant with existing relevant UK regulations\\".  United States  The Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), like PEGI, provides voluntary video game content ratings for games in the United States. ESRB does not consider loot boxes as a form of gambling, and will not rate such games with their \\"Real Gambling\\" content descriptions. ESRB considers that loot boxes are equivalent to collectible card game booster packs, and that the player is always receiving something of value with opening a loot-box purchase, even if it is not something the player desires. The Board further stated that games that are labelled with \\"Real Gambling\\" will likely be then rated \\"AO\\" (Adults Only), to comply with gambling laws; retailers typically do not stock such games, and would thus harm a publisher. Additionally, the ESRB also sees themselves as responsbile to help guide parents on video game content. As an example, they found that parents were more worried about children spending money in-game and not any gambling aspects, and thus did not include loot boxes as one of its content descriptions, though would like to add them in the future should legislation or other industry standards establish gambling as a critical issue. The Entertainment Software Association, the parent organization of the ESRB, asserted loot boxes are not a form of gambling, stressing that they are a voluntary and optional aspect in these games. Major publishers Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive have also stated they do not see loot boxes as gambling due to their voluntary nature. Electronic Arts' CEO Andrew Wilson stated in May 2018 that they will continue to include loot boxes in their games, and \\"While we forbid the transfer of items of in-the-game currency outside, we're also actively seeking to eliminate that where it's going on in an illegal environment, and we're working with regulators in various jurisdictions to achieve that\\". While other publishers have acquiesced to governmental concerns about loot boxes, Electronic Arts has been generally steadfast in that they do not believe their implementation of loot boxes is a form of gambling. In statements made at hearings with the UK Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee, EA representatives compared loot boxes to \\"surprise mechanics\\" that one would find with Kinder Surprise eggs, and believe that their implementation of loot boxes are \\"quite ethical and quite fun, quite enjoyable to people\\". In the wake of the criticism over Star Wars Battlefront II, financial analysts suggested that the video game industry will need to develop self-regulating principles to better handle monetization and loot-box schemes to avoid government intervention into the industry. Sen. Maggie Hassan urged the ESRB to self-regulate the industry with respect to loot boxes in February 2018. In February 2018, Senator Maggie Hassan brought up the issue of loot boxes during a hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee to four Federal Trade Commission nominees, which the Commission oversees. She asked the nominees if \\"that children being addicted to gaming - and activities like loot boxes that might make them more susceptible to addiction - is a problem that merits attention?\\"; all four nominees agreed attention would be necessary. The same day, Hassan authored a letter to the ESRB \\"to review the completeness of the board's ratings process and policies as they relate to loot boxes, and to take into account the potential harm these types of micro-transactions may have on children\\" and \\"to examine whether the design and marketing approach to loot boxes in games geared toward children is being conducted in an ethical and transparent way that adequately protects the developing minds of young children from predatory practices.\\" Though neither the hearing nor the letter called for regulation, Brian Crecente of Glixel considered these as pretense to get the ESRB to act on its own before Congress would be forced to take legislative action. In response to Hassan's letter, the ESRB announced in February 2018 that it would require any rated game that offers any type of in-game purchase with real- world funds, encompassing loot boxes, would be required to be labeled as such. ESRB stated the labeling was primarily meant to help parents watch for games for their children, and because of the brevity of space they have on retail packaging, did not opt to required publishers to identify the specific form of microtransaction. However, the board still asserted that they still do not believe loot boxes themselves are a form of gambling. While Sen. Hassan called the ESRB's decision a \\"step forward\\", she still remained concerned of \\"the ESRB's skepticism regarding the potentially addictive nature of loot boxes and microtransactions in video games\\", and stated \\"I will work with all relevant stakeholders to continue oversight on these issues and ensure that meaningful improvements are made to increase transparency and consumer protections.\\" The ESRB introduced this new label \\"In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)\\" in April 2020 to be used for games that include loot box-style mechanics. During a November 2018 Congressional hearing over problems with Cambridge Analytica's data leak and associated with Facebook and Google, Joseph Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), promised to Congress that the FTC will investigate loot boxes, considering the potential market value of microtransactions. After the government had shut down in early 2019, delaying the FTC review, Hassan pushed on the FTC to provide an update on their review of loot boxes. The FTC held a public hearing on loot boxes on August 7, 2019, addressing industry representative and reviewing public comments submitted prior to the meeting. During the meeting, ESA representatives stated that Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony are working on developing requirements for new or updated games using loot boxes, published on their respective console systems, to disclose the odds for items from loot boxes. Other publishers within the ESA, including Activision Blizzard, Bandai Namco, Bethesda, Bungie, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, Ubisoft, Warner Bros., and Wizards of the Coast, also stated they are committed to doing the same for other gaming platforms such as on personal computers, as to align with the existing requirements for the iOS App Store and Google Play mobile platforms. These efforts are expected to be in place before the end of 2020, according to the ESA. Nintendo issued a new policy the next day to reflect the statement made to the FTC, requiring loot box odds to be published for all new and updated games on its systems, and assuring such games with in-game purchases could be regulated by parents on their Nintendo Switch Online app. Epic Games affirmed they would also follow similar policies as adopted by the ESA and other publishers, already having taken steps to eliminate loot boxes from Fortnite, Rocket League and other games in its portfolio. Worldwide Apple implemented changes to the iOS App Store in December 2017, requiring developers that publish games to the Store that include monetised loot boxes or other similar mechanisms that provide random items in exchange for real- world funds, to publish the odds of items that can be received from these mechanisms prior to the player spending funds on the game. Google followed suit by May 2019, requiring apps in the Play Store using loot box mechanics to publish their odds. In November 2018, the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) urged the video game industry to take action on loot boxes before governments step in to regulate them. IDGA identified three areas for the industry to focus on: commit to not marketing loot-box mechanics to youth, disclose the odds of receiving items in loot boxes, and educate parents on in- game parental controls. In February 2019, review aggregator OpenCritic began incorporating details about games that use loot boxes into its summary pages for games. In the academic literature, King and Delfabbro proposed twenty-four \\"social responsibility\\" measures that could be implemented by video game companies to prevent or reduce overspending on loot boxes. However, the willingness of the industry to adopt these measures has been questioned because of the industry's economic interests.  Litigation  In February 2020, two separate class-action lawsuits were filed in France against Electronic Arts over the Ultimate Team part of the FIFA games asserting it is equivalent to unregulated gambling. One class member asserted they spent over on Ultimate Team packs and never received a high-ranking place, which was necessary to get to be able to compete online with other players. The suits also content that the FIFA games lack any parental controls to limit spending, which, combined with the pay-to-win nature of Ultimate Team, encourage underage gambling, directly referencing the 2019 decisions from Belgium and the Netherlands. A class-action lawsuit filed in California in June 2020 against Apple asserted that through the games using loot boxes mechanics offered by Apple's App Store, Apple \\"engages in predatory practices enticing consumers, including children to engage in gambling and similar addictive conduct in violation of this and other laws designed to protect consumers and to prohibit such practices\\". The lawsuit asserts that with these apps, Apple allows their devices to become unauthorized gambling devices which are illegal under California's code. Another class-action lawsuit was filed against EA in California in August 2020 over their Ultimate Team loot boxes in FIFA and Madden NFL games, with the plaintiff represented by the same legal firm as the June 2020 case against Apple. The EA case seeks a jury trial to decide if the Ultimate Team loot boxes are considered gambling mechanisms under California law, and seek in damages.  Impact  As a result of the heightened criticism and regulation, some studios began to remove or replace loot boxes in their games. Phoenix Labs opted to remove their equivalent of loot boxes from Dauntless, instead replacing the system with the ability to directly purchase customization items players want through in-game currency or real-world funds allowing them to achieve monetization for the game. Playsaurus, the developers of the free-to-play Clicker Heroes, announced in November 2017 that the game's sequel would not be free-to-play, citing ethical concerns of offering loot box-type systems that could encourage gambling-type behavior. In January 2019, Epic Games adjusted the mechanics of Fortnite: Save the World loot boxes that are purchased with real-world funds, allowing purchasers to see the contents of the loot box before buying, as to address concerns of loot boxes being related to gambling. Psyonix removed them in Rocket League in December 2019, replacing them with a direct item shop.

Life  He was ordained a Pallotine father, and spent his first period of missionary work in Broome, where he served as parish priest for eight years. His interest in ethnography led to particular studies among the Bardi people. Stolen bones In 1935 Worms came across the large body of an Aboriginal person wrapped for burial in bark and, as was a widespread custom, placed in the fork of a tree. He gathered the remains and dispatched them to Limburg. Worms was quite aware that he was violating the law against the unauthorised export of ethnological materials in doing so, and therefore requested anonymity.

It was initially used by elements of the 1st Norfolk Rifle Volunteer Corps which became the 1st Volunteer Battalion, The Norfolk Regiment in 1883. It became the headquarters of the 4th Territorial Battalion the Norfolk Regiment when that battalion moved from the Bethel Street drill hall during the First World War. The battalion was mobilised at the Chapel Field Road drill hall in September 1939 for service in the Middle East and then the Far East during the Second World War.

The company was founded in 2016 by Dov Charney, the founder of American Apparel. Los Angeles Apparel is a vertically integrated manufacturer and currently employs over 1800 personnel. History Los Angeles Apparel was founded by Dov Charney in 2016 in Los Angeles, California after being forced out of American Apparel by its board amid allegations of mismanagement and sexual harassment of employees. Charney launched Los Angeles Apparel as a wholesale business, similar to American Apparel's origins in 1989. Los Angeles Apparel consists of about 1,800+ employees, including many former American Apparel workers. About 90 percent of the factory's machinery once belonged to American Apparel. According to Bloomberg, Charney bought fabric, computers, sewing machines, and other equipments from American Apparel in the bankruptcy sale. In late 2016, Cincinnati based TSC Apparel made a multimillion-dollar business deal with Los Angeles Apparel, selling the startup's clothes to concert producer Live Nation Entertainment and screen printers who previously purchased American Apparel. In July 2020, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health ordered the temporary closure of the Los Angeles Apparel factory after over 300 employees tested positive and 4 died of COVID-19. In response, Charney reportedly told CNN that testing employees would be key to preventing spread of the virus, stating that in hindsight, he \\"would have fought for more testing earlier.\\" He also suggested that a lack of testing and contact tracing by the county may have contributed to the elevated number of infections within Los Angeles. On July 23rd, the L.A. County Health Department announced that Los Angeles Apparel would reopen and resume operations. The company said that they were working closely with the health department and would be \\"pursuing the highest safety standards for our workers and will continue to strive to make improvements.\\" Production Los Angeles Apparel was started as wholesale business. The company is upfront about the fact that its clothing and business model is similar to that of American Apparel. Los Angeles Apparel is a manufacturer and distributor of apparel to screen printers, apparel companies, and boutiques. The company focuses on production of T-shirts, sweatshirts, cotton bodysuits and swimwear. The company is a vertically integrated manufacturer with knitting and dyeing done in Los Angeles. Los Angeles Apparel's factory spreads over the area of 100,000 square foot with current capacity of 140,000 units per week. The company is devoted to keeping production domestic and employing garment workers in Los Angeles. Corporate culture =Fair wage labor practice= Los Angeles Apparel supports and strives for fair wage labor practices. The company's workers earn wage of $15~20 per hour. The workers at Los Angeles Apparel own equity in the company making it employee owned. The company focuses on local manufacturing and attempts to employ workers in the Los Angeles area. =Vertical integration= Los Angeles Apparel is a vertically integrated company, expanding its business operations into different steps on the same production path. The company has total control over the supply chain from manufacturing to end sales. Los Angeles Apparel purchases textile and yarn products made in USA, supporting local manufacturing. More than half of yarn utilization is acquired from domestic sources. =Environment friendly production= Los Angeles Apparel integrates organic cotton and reclaimed cotton into their supply chain.

He is the Executive Chairman of Wamda Group, a platform that builds and invests in entrepreneurship ecosystems across the Middle East and North Africa, Turkey and East Africa through Ecosystem Development programs and a Venture Capital fund investing in technology-enabled companies that operate in these markets. The son of Ali Ghandour, founder of Royal Jordanian Airlines, and Altaf Daher, Fadi Ghandour was born in Beirut in 1959. He graduated from George Washington University in Washington, D.C. in 1981. In 1982, he co-founded Aramex with Bill Kingson. Aramex is one of the largest package delivery and logistics companies in the Middle East and North African region, a market previously unevenly served by other courier services. In 1997, Ghandour took Aramex public on NASDAQ, making it the first company from the Arab world to be listed on an American stock exchange, before taking it private again in 2002. Aramex went public once more in 2005 and is currently listed on the Dubai Financial Market (DFM). It is now a global logistics and transportation provider, employing over 17,000 people working in over 600 offices across 70 countries. Ghandour stepped down as CEO of Aramex in 2012, concluding a thirty-year tenure. He remains on the company's board. He is also the Founder and Chairman of Ruwwad for Development, a private sector led community empowerment platform supporting marginalized communities through activism, civic engagement, education and financial inclusion operating in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt. Ruwwad was launched in 2005, and focuses on three areas of impact through its Youth Organizing, Child Development, Community Support, and Community-led Campaigns. Ghandour is a key figure and active member of MENA's startup ecosystem. He is a founding investor of Maktoob, acquired by Yahoo! in 2009. Throughout his years as serial entrepreneur and mentor in MENA, Ghandour identified gaps he believed were stalling the growth of the region's entrepreneurship ecosystem, namely opening regional markets, financing and mentorship. Ghandour also called on corporates to be further engaged in supporting entrepreneurship in their markets, and has coined the term ‚ÄòCorporate Entrepreneurship Responsibility‚Äô. In 2010, he launched MENA Venture Investments (MVI), an angel investment company, to invest in tech-enabled businesses at the seed stage. MVI invested in companies such as Souq.com, initially an auction site linked to Maktoob and later spun off as an e-commerce platform, which was acquired by Amazon in 2016. In parallel to MVI, Wamda.com was launched to offer a knowledge and research platform as well as community programs for entrepreneurs and supporting stakeholders in the MENA region. In 2014, Ghandour launched Wamda Capital, an early-stage investment fund, focusing on investing in early-stage technology startups in the Middle East, Turkey and East Africa.

In 1878, he moved the family to Government Gums, South Australia, where for two years he oversaw the completion of part of the Central Australia Railway. Herbert assisted his father as a timekeeper and storekeeper, mixing with the adult workers. When the family moved back to Melbourne in 1881, he attended Wesley College. He later went on to the University of Melbourne, graduating with a Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree in 1890.Rivett, Rohan. Australian Citizen : Herbert Brookes 1867-1963. Melbourne, M.U.P., 1965. Business career After graduation, Brookes spent a year in Queensland working on his father's pastoral leases. He then returned to Victoria to work in the mining industry, managing a series of small mines. In 1905, Brookes moved to Melbourne to work for Austral Otis, a large engineering firm. He became a director of the company in 1912. Brookes' father died in 1910, leaving him and his siblings an estate valued at ¬£172,000. He received the chairmanship of Australian Paper Mills (which his father had founded in 1882), and also managed the William Brookes & Co. pastoral holdings in Queensland and Western Australia. Brookes was president of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures from 1913 to 1917. Government work Brookes served on the Board of Trade from 1918 to 1928 and the Tariff Board from 1922 to 1928. In 1929, Prime Minister Stanley Bruce appointed him Commissioner-General to the United States, working within the British embassy in Washington, D.C. as Australia did not have separate diplomatic representation at that time. He was recalled the following year to save money during the Depression. From 1932 to 1939, Brookes served on the board of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, including as vice-chairman; he was offered the chairmanship, but refused it due to his inability to secure a guarantee of independence from government control. Community work and philanthropy As a distinguished alumnus, Brookes served on the University of Melbourne's council from 1933 to 1947, where he was particularly active on its finance committee. He financed a new wing for the university's Conservatorium of Music, and contributed towards a house for the university's vice- chancellor. He was also involved in the creation of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Brookes held leadership positions in the Chautauqua Association, the League of Nations Union, and the English-Speaking Union. In 1906, he and his second wife established the T. E. Brown Society, which was initially devoted to the works of Thomas Edward Brown but later became more of a general literary society. Political activities Brookes assisted with the formation of the Commonwealth Liberal Party in 1909 and the formation of the Nationalist Party in 1917, although he was mainly active behind the scenes and never stood for public office himself. He was socially progressive, but considered the Labor Party too extreme.Rivett, Rohan. Australian Citizen : Herbert Brookes 1867-1963. Melbourne, M.U.P., 1965. He was an advocate of profit sharing, adult education, and equal pay for women, all of which he introduced in his own companies, and campaigned for better working conditions in mines to eradicate miner's phthisis. Personal life Brookes was a member of the Australian Church, a Melbourne congregational church known for its liberal theology. In 1897, he married Jessie Dennistoun Strong (known as Jennie), the eldest daughter of the church's founder, Charles Strong. He was widowed in 1899, and in 1905 remarried to Ivy Deakin. She was the daughter of Alfred Deakin, Prime Minister of Australia, who also attended the Australian Church. Brookes and his second wife had three children together: Sir Wilfred Deakin Brookes (a businessman and Second World War Royal Australian Airforce officer), Jessie Clarke who married Anthony Clarke, and Alfred Deakin Brookes (the first head of ASIS).

They were discovered in 1887 on the site of the ancient Gree city of Mantineia in Arcadia and were probably decoration for a statue base. They have been attributed to the sculptor Praxiteles or another member of his workshop. They are currently kept in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, where their inventory numbers are NAMA 215-217. Description On 11 August 1887 in the course of excavations at Mantineia by the French School at Athens, the archaeologist Gustave Foug√®res discovered the three plaques, which had been reused in the floor of a Byzantine church.Foug√®res, p. 105. The upper part had been heavily worn by the passage of the parishioners, but the side facing downwards still bore sculpted decoration in a good state. The plaques were immediately transferred to the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, where they were restored. They are made of white marble, which was once identified as the marble of Doliana, near Tegea, but is now recognised to be Pentelic marble.Pasquier, p. 110. The three plaques have very similar dimensions: NAMA 216 is 1.35 m wide and 0.96 m high; NAMA 215 and 217 are 1.36 m by 0.96 m and 0.98 m respectively. Their depth varies from 8 to 12 cm. They are decorated in the same way: on the upper part, an Echinus moulding above a broad flat band, on the lower edge there is a concave moulding and another broad flat band. Each panel has three attachment holes in the same locations. These aspects indicate that they were all made together.Foug√®res, p. 106.. Each plaque depicts three figures on a blank background. They are juxtaposed simply, without any complicated compositional features.Rolley, p. 254. =Apollo and Marsyas (NAMA 216)= At left, the god Apollo is represented seated, with long hair, wearing a chiton and himation, and holding a kithara in his left hand which rests on his left knee. With his right hand he grabs a fold in his himation. At right, Marsyas is shown with a beard, his left leg bent, playing the aulos (double flute). In the centre a bearded man is standing, wearing a kind of Phrygian cap, a chiton, and anaxyrides (trousers), holding a knife in one hand. Based on the identifications of the other two figures, he must be the servant who flays Marsyas after he loses his musical contest against Apollo. =Muses (NAMA 215 and 217)= The other two plaques represent the Muses, who, in some versions of the myth of Marsyas, were the judges of the contest.e.g HygFab (165.4) and Libanios (14). The Muses are differentiated. On NAMA 215, the one on the left holds an aulos, the one in the centre holds the folds of her himation, and the one on the right is seated and plays a little string instrument - perhaps a bandora. On NAMA 217, the left Muse holds some unrolled parchment, the central Muse holds a rolled-up scroll in her left hand, and the right Muse holds up a kithara in her right hand. Canonically, there were nine Muses, so presumably there was a fourth plaque depicting the missing three Muses. Attribution When he published the discovery, Foug√®res suggested that the three palques decorated the sides of a rectangular pedestal and suggested that they be associated with a passage of Pausanias who mentions in his description of Mantineia, \\"a sanctuary of Leto and her children; it was Praxiteles who made the statues, two generations after Alcamenes; on their base there are carvings of a Muse and a Marsyas playing the aulos.\\"PauDes (8.9.1). Marion Muller- Dufeu, La Sculpture grecque. Sources litt√©raires et √©pigraphiques, Paris, √©ditions de l'√âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, coll. ¬´ Beaux-Arts histoire ¬ª, 2002 (), no 1394, p. 485. This text which has been transmitted mentions only a single Muse and presents a difficulty in that while representations of Marsyas playing the flute with a single Maenad are common, there are no known representations of Marsyas playing the flute with a single Muse.Foug√®res, p. 107. To resolve the problem, it has been suggested that Pausanias, whose descriptions are often very vague, was confused and has mistaken Apollo for a Muse. Foug√®res proposed to emend ŒúŒø·ø¶œÉŒ± (Muse) to ŒúŒø·ø¶œÉŒ±Œπ (Muses), a correction which has been widely accepted since. Hypothetical reconstruction of the plaques in order to force them to match Pausanias' description. The main objection to this hypothesis concerns the proposed arrangement of the base, with the plaque of Apollo and Marsyas on the front, the plaques of the Muses on the sides. This would create a base measuring 1.36 x 1.36 metres, which would be too small for the three statues that Pausanias mentions.Johannes Overbeck, Berichte der Koniglich Sachsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, 1888, p. 184ff. The three plaques could instead be arranged next to one another, with Apollo and Marsyas in the centre and the Muses on either side, but there are no traces of attachments for connecting the plaques on their sides, which argues against this hypothesis.Ridgway [1997], p. 206. It has been proposed to see the plaques as the decoration for a platform for the competitors of a musical contest which took place every year in Arcadia according to Polybius.Polybius 4.20.9. Indeed, one of the heads of the Muses of NAMA 217 was recovered from the ruins of the theatre.Johannes N. Svoronos, Das Athener Nationalmuseum, vol. I, Beck und Barth, Ath√®nes, 1908 (German translation of the Greek original of 1903), p. 192. However, this reconstruction is not supported by any archaeological evidence.Ridgway [1997], p. 207 ; Pasquier, p. 111..

Caproens (fl 1675 ‚Äì 1725, in Antwerp) was a still life painter active in Antwerp in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Only a handful of works by the artist have been identified to date. Caproens painted flower and fruit still lifes, garland paintings and banquet still lifes.Jacob Caproens at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life  Nothing is known about the life of Jacob Caproens. The first mention of the artist is in an 18th-century sale catalogue, which mentions one large flower painting and two large flower and fruit paintings by Caproens.Marie-Louise Hairs, Dominique Finet, The Flemish Flower Painters in the XVIIth Century, International Specialized Book Service Incorporated, 1985, p. 403 He is believed to have been active in Antwerp. While some art historians have situated the period of his activity between 1675 and 1725 others place it earlier between 1653 and 1672. Work Cartouche still life of flowers around an image of Caritas Caproens painted flower and fruit still lifes, garland paintings and banquet still lifes. Caproens' signature has been found on at least three large flower and fruit still lifes, which are clearly inspired by Flemish still life painting. His banquet style still lifes depicting food and tableware placed on a table also show the influence of Jan Davidszoon de Heem, a Dutch still life painter who was active in Antwerp from the mid-1630s. Caproens produced a number of compositions in the genre of 'garland paintings'. Garland paintings are a type of still life invented in early 17th century Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder and subsequently practised by leading Flemish still life painters, and in particular Daniel Seghers. The first paintings in this genre typically showed a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. In the later development of the genre, the devotional image was replaced by other subjects such as portraits, mythological subjects and allegorical scenes.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115‚Äì150. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life painter who painted the garland and a figure painter who filled the central cartouche with an image. The cartouche in the center of Caproens's garland paintings is filled with religious as well as mythological imagery. A pair of garland paintings entitled Cartouche still life of flowers around an image of Caritas and Cartouche still life of flowers around a bacchanal of putti (Town hall of Braunlage) have respectively a religious and secular cartouche. \\"Just didn‚Äôt pick it up again ‚Äì two flower still lifes in Braunlage (Germany). The two works in the Town hall of Braunlage are possibly looted art as they were left at the end of World War II in a local hotel by a German soldier who said he would collect them later. The soldier never returned and the paintings were then presented to the mayor who hung them in the town hall.

The PU it is under the authority of Ministry of Defence. Its tasks increase during wartime to include traffic control organisation and POW and refugee control. The Military Police are distinguished from other units by their wearing of black uniform and the blue brassard worn around the left upper arm, with the \\"MP\\" lettering in white, symbol of military police.  History  After the fall of the 50-year-long communist regime of Albania, there was a need to reform the Armed Forces in all its pertinent structures. On 1 February 1992, the Military Police was established upon approval by Parliament of Law No. 511, dated 08.08.1991, \\"On the Military Police in the Armed Forces of the Republic of Albania\\". The purpose of this structure was to strengthen order and discipline in AAF and it was considered as an essential thing to transform the Army according to NATO countries‚Äô standards. With the creation of MP, the focus of its work was to control military vehicle traffic, maintenance of military rule in order to strengthen discipline in AF. In December 1994, attached to MP, were created the structures of Criminal Police and Fire Fighting Service. In early 1995, the MP branch in General Staff was transformed into the MP directorate commanded by Brig. Gen. Bajram Malaj. Through legal support, regulations and its professionalism growing day by day, the MP ranked among the best units of the Armed Forces. After the events of 1997, the MP Director was Col. Piro Lutaj. After the events of 1997, MP had a tremendous growth on the basis of a project with the Italian Delegation of Experts (DIE). At that time, with the assistance of Italian specialists, for the first time, the MP battalion was created in Tirana, which was equipped with the necessary logistics and materials, and it was conceived according to Italian Carabinieri battalions. The establishment of MP battalion in Tirana marks a qualitative leap in the activity of this modern structure and the most qualitative of the time, which became apparent in the events of 1998, when the MP not only suffered any damage, but it defended several state institutions such as, the Radio Televizioni Shqiptar, Albtelecom, General Prosecutor‚Äôs Office and several international institutions. Equipment of MP battalion in Tirana, with the necessary technique and armoured vehicles Iveco VM 90, played a huge role in the events of 1998 in Albania. This structure played an undeniable role in 1999, during the Kosovo crisis, when it had the major role for the welcome, escorting and treatment of refugees at camps set up in Kuk√´s, Tirana, Durr√´s and other cities around the country, keeping under control the situation in the areas of Kuk√´s, Krum√´, Tropoj√´, especially at border posts, solving many difficult situations, escorting convoys and personalities that travelled to north and back, as well as maintaining control of the road network across the country, especially in the north. The events of 1997, 1998 and the Kosovo crisis are the most important events in the history of MP. In late 2000, with the suppression of the structure of the MP Directorate, by the Order of the Ministry of Defence no. 1, dated 01.05.2001, ‚ÄúOn the organization of the Military Police Regiment‚Äù, the Military Police Regiment was established and its commander was Lieutenant colonel Namik Goga. This structure exercised its activity until September 2003, protecting and safeguarding all exercises that took place on the territory of the country. In September 2003, the MP structure was transformed into a battalion structure based in Tirana and its commander was Lieutenant colonel Xhevahir Avdia, who held this office until 2005. In 2005 the commander of the battalion was appointed Lieutenant colonel Drini Nikolla, who held this office until 2008. In July 2007, the MP battalion became an organic part of the Support Command, and its administrative management was subordinated to the Support Command, while its Operational Commanding was subordinated to the General Staff. Part of the battalion were four sections of MP in Shkod√´r, Durr√´s, Berat, Vlor√´ and five subsections of MP, in Kuk√´s, Burrel, Elbasan, Korc√´ and Gjirokast√´r, where the sectors of Criminal Police, Judicial Police, vehicle traffic, Fire Fighting and Rescue conducted their activities. In 2008, Colonel Xhevdet Zeneli became commander of the MP battalion. In May 2010, the structure of the Military Police was named Military Police of the Armed Forces in compliance with Law No. 9069 dated 15.05.200, ‚ÄúOn the Military Police of the Armed Forces\\", and MP continues to have this structure nowadays. During these years, MP is trained by the specialists of Italian Carabineers, U.S, German and Turkish military police. For years, MP, through a special program, is preparing a sub-unit of platoon-level NRF (NATO Response Force), a force ready to act as part of NATO relevant structure, capable and suitably equipped to perform such duties. So far, around 50 people of Military Police have been part of different missions abroad, in Iraq and Afghanistan, in support of the Armed Forces and various international HQs. MP has also conducted a mission in ‚ÄúISAF‚Äù military operation, in Kabul, Afghanistan. This platoon consisted of 22 people.  Mission and tasks  Maintaining order in the AAF, detection, prevention and prosecution of criminal activity, engagement in the fight against terrorism, participation in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations and protection of state property managed and used by the Armed Forces. The MP's tasks include: * Ensures the military order outside the military units in public and non-public environments. * Protects life, health and dignity of the military from any illegal act when they are offended due to his/her duty attributes. * Protects the state property managed and used by the Armed Forces from illegal activity. * Intervenes to avoid acts of terrorism in the Armed Forces. * Works for the detection, prevention and prosecution of criminal activity against members of the Armed Forces, military property and facilities. * Implements the decisions of the court, the acts of Military Prosecution on searching, capturing and bringing the military forcibly to the court when they avoid prosecution or the penitentiary. * Controls and secures the military transport. * Controls the movement and use of military means and technique. * Controls and takes measures to implement legislation against Fire Intervention Measures (FIM). * Ensures the enforcement of military order during military exercises, military ceremonies and activities organized by GSAF (General Staff of the Armed Forces). * Escorts the military dignitaries of the Armed Forces, and counterpart foreign delegations. * Performs duties in the interests of the Albanian military forces in missions abroad and foreign military forces operating in Albania in accordance to the laws in force. * Performs and supports humanitarian operations.  Structure  The Military Police consists of the following elements: * 25px Military Police, in Sauk ** Criminal Police Sector ** Judicial Police Section ** Military Discipline Section ** Vehicle Traffic Inspectorate ** Fire Protection Inspectorate ** 1st Military Police Operations Company ** 2nd Military Police Operations Company ** Support Company  Equipment and Uniform  =Uniform= MP brassard worn on left arm Since 2013, the Military Police uses three uniforms, including the Combat- Uniform (ACU), the Service Uniform (ASU) and the Ceremonial Uniform. Both of Service and Ceremonial uniforms are on black. The ACU usually it is the same pattern of the standard uniform of the Albanian Land Forces, but together with the service uniform, it distinguishes from other militaries officers by a blue brassard worn around the left upper arm, with the \\"MP\\" lettering in white. This patch is attached to the uniform by hook and loop fastener. = Weapons = A member of the MP equipped with Beretta ARX160 In the modernization programme of the AAF, particular attention was paid to the Military Police. To bring them up to NATO standards, current efforts focus on upgrading equipment and armaments, enhancing their operational effectiveness, and combat training. Although the MP employs various individual weapons to provide light firepower at short ranges, the standard weapon used by the ground force is the Beretta ARX160, which since 2015 has entirely replaced AK-47 variants. Also as the standard handgun, the MP uses Beretta PX4 9√ó19mm Parabellum which is widely used by all Albanian Armed Forces. Support fire is provided by the Heckler & Koch MG4 light machine gun and the Heckler & Koch MG5 general-purpose machine gun. The most used sniper rifles are the Sako TRG-22 and TRG-44 to give the infantry a long-range weapon. The semi-automatic shotgun Benelli M4 Super 90 is used for door breaching and close-quarters combat. Hand grenades, fragmentation and smoke grenades along with the grenade launcher systems, such as the GLX160, are also used. = Vehicles = Since the late 1990s, the Military Police mostly operates with two variants of the Iveco VM 90 military vehicle. The VM 90T Torpedo used as transport vehicle and the VM 90P Protetto which is used as armored vehicle for interventions in combat situations. However, the vehicle will remain in service until the completion of their lifecycle, since their replacement has started in 2015 in favor of Iveco LMV. In 2015, four Iveco LMV armored vehicles were made available to the MP. These vehicles will serve to increase the technical and operational capacities of the Military Police missions and duties as well as to develop, complete and increase the operational level of the unit to perform difficult operations in high-risk areas and beyond.

Rutter composed the work for the London Concord Singers who first performed them in 1973. The five movements are: # Monday's Child # The Owl and the Pussycat # Windy Nights # Matthew, Mark, Luke and John # Sing a Song of Sixpence The first song is based on \\"Monday's Child\\", a fortune-telling song and nursery rhyme. The text of the second song is \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\", a nonsense-poem by Edward Lear published in 1871. The third song is based on a poem, \\"Windy Nights\\", by Robert Louis Stevenson. The text for the fourth song is \\"Matthew, Mark, Luke and John\\", a nursery rhyme and evening prayer. The fifth song uses the nursery rhyme \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\". The composer noted: \\"The Five Childhood lyrics are a kind of 'homage' to the world of children. I chose for my texts some of the rhymes and verses remembered from my earliest years, and set them to music as simply as I could‚Äîthough the last of the five, which uses a familiar nursery tune, contains a certain amount of tongue-in-cheek elaboration.\\" The pieces were described by a reviewer for Gramophone as \\"delightful compositions\\", while another reviewer noted \\"the energy and sharp-witted invention that characterize these youthful pieces\\".

(2016) found that the global maximum of ANE ancestry occurs in modern-day Native Americans, Kets and Selkup. Additionally it has been reported in ancient Bronze-age-steppe Yamnaya and Afanasevo cultures. According to Lazaridis between 14% and 38% of Native American ancestry may originate from gene flow from the Mal'ta‚ÄìBuret' people (ANE). This difference is caused by the penetration of posterior Siberian migrations into the Americas, with the lowest percentages of ANE ancestry found in Eskimos and Alaskan Natives, as these groups are the result of migrations into the Americas roughly 5,000 years ago. Other estimates for ANE ancestry among first wave Native Americans show higher percentages, such as those belonging to the Andean region in South America. The other gene flow in Native Americans appears to have an Eastern Eurasian origin. Gene sequencing of another south-central Siberian people (Afontova Gora-2) dating to approximately 17,000 years ago, revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures to that of Mal'ta boy-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied by humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Genomic studies also indicate that ANE was introduced to Western Europe by way of the Yamnaya culture, long after the Paleolithic. The ANE genetic component is visible in tests of the Yamnaya people, and seems to make up 50% of their ancestry indirectly. It is also reported in modern-day Europeans (7%‚Äì25% ANE admixture directly from Yamnaya), but not of Europeans predating the Bronze Age. Additional ANE ancestry is found in European populations through paleolithic interactions with Eastern Hunter-Gatherers, which resulted in populations such as Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers. Groups derived from the Ancient North Eurasians Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) is a lineage derived predominantly (75%) from ANE. It is represented by two individuals from Karelia, one of Y-haplogroup R1a-M417, dated c. 8.4 kya, the other of Y-haplogroup J, dated c. 7.2 kya; and one individual from Samara, of Y-haplogroup R1b-P297, dated c. 7.6 kya. This lineage is closely related to the ANE sample from Afontova Gora, dated c. 18 kya. After the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, the Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG) and EHG lineages merged in Eastern Europe, accounting for early presence of ANE-derived ancestry in Mesolithic Europe. Evidence suggests that as Ancient North Eurasians migrated West from Eastern Siberia, they absorbed Western Hunter-Gatherers and other West Eurasian populations as well. Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer (CHG) is represented by the Satsurblia individual dated ~13 kya (from the Satsurblia cave in Georgia), and carried 36% ANE-derived admixture. While the rest of their ancestry is derived from the Dzudzuana cave individual dated ~26 kya, which lacked ANE-admixture, Dzudzuana affinity in the Caucasus decreased with the arrival of ANE at ~13 kya Satsurblia. Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer (SHG) is represented by several individuals buried at Motala, Sweden ca. 6000 BC. They were descended from Western Hunter-Gatherers who initially settled Scandinavia from the south, and later populations of EHG who entered Scandinavia from the north through the coast of Norway. Iran Neolithic (Iran_N) individuals dated ~8.5 kya carried 50% ANE-derived admixture and 50% Dzudzuana-related admixture, marking them as different from other Near-Eastern and Anatolian Neolithics who didn't have ANE admixture. Iran Neolithics were later replaced by Iran Chalcolithics, who were a mixture of Iran Neolithic and Near Eastern Levant Neolithic. Ancient Beringian/Ancestral Native American are specific archaeogenetic lineages, based on the genome of an infant found at the Upward Sun River site (dubbed USR1), dated to 11,500 years ago. The AB lineage diverged from the Ancestral Native American (ANA) lineage about 20,000 years ago. West Siberian Hunter-Gatherer (WSG) are a specific archaeogenetic lineage, first reported in a genetic study published in Science in September 2019. WSGs were found to be of about 30% EHG ancestry, 50% ANE ancestry, and 20% East Asian ancestry. Evolution of blond hair The derived allele of the KITLG SNP rs12821256 is associated with, and likely causal for, blond hair in Europeans. The earliest known individual with this allele is the Siberian ANE individual Afontova Gora 3, which is dated to 16130-15749 BCE. This allele is also present in one hunter-gatherer each from Samara, Motala and Ukraine (I0124, I0014 and I1763), as well as several later individuals with Steppe ancestry. Since the allele is found in populations with EHG but not Western Hunter-Gatherer ancestry, it suggests that its origin is in the Ancient North Eurasian population. Geneticist David Reich said that the KITLG gene for blond hair entered continental Europe in a massive population migration from the Eurasian steppe, by a people who had Ancient North Eurasian ancestry.  Comparative mythology  Since the term 'Ancient North Eurasian' refers to a genetic bridge of connected mating networks, scholars of comparative mythology have argued that they probably shared myths and beliefs that could be reconstructed via the comparison of stories attested within cultures that were not in contact for millennia and stretched from the Pontic-Caspian steppe to the American continent. For instance, the mytheme of the dog guarding the Otherworld possibly stems from an older Ancient North Eurasian belief, as suggested by similar motifs found in Indo-European, Native American and Siberian mythology. In Siouan, Algonquian, Iroquoian, and in Central and South American beliefs, a fierce guard dog was located in the Milky Way, perceived as the path of souls in the afterlife, and getting past it was a test. The Siberian Chukchi and Tungus believed in a guardian-of-the-afterlife dog and a spirit dog that would absorb the dead man's soul and act as a guide in the afterlife. In Indo-European myths, the figure of the dog is embodied by Cerberus, SarvarƒÅ, and Garmr. Anthony and Brown note that it might be one of the oldest mythemes recoverable through comparative mythology. Philologist Aleksandar Loma argues that parts of Native American and Indo-European concepts connecting wolves with ritual knowledge and magic may represent a common Ancient North Eurasian heritage. The word mai-coh means both 'wolf' and 'witch' among Navajos, and shunk manita tanka a 'doglike powerful spirit' among Sioux. The Proto-Indo-European root *·π∑eid (\\"knowledge, clairvoyance\\") designated the wolf in both Hittite (·π∑etna) and Old Norse (witnir), and a \\"werewolf\\" in Slavic languages (Serbian vjedo-gonja, Slovenian vedanec, Ukrainian vi≈°ƒçun). Historian Michael P. Speidel has compared the fighting madness and dancing frenzy of the Aztec Quachics wolf-warriors with the Germanic mad wolf-warriors (Berserks), and has argued that this could be due to shared historical origins‚Äìor perhaps a feature common to warrior societies: the more willing a warrior is to attack recklessly, the more useful he may be in battle. According to comparative mythologist Bernard Sergent, the Lithuanian myth of Eglƒó the Queen of Serpents shares similar motifs with stories found among Native American peoples (Wayampi, Yahgan and Coos), which may be explained by an inherited Ancient North Eurasian motif featuring a woman marrying an aquatic animal, violating human laws on exogamy and connecting the terrestrial and aquatic worlds. Sergent reminds however that the precise time and place of origin of the myth cannot be settled with certainty.

Life His birth name was Nicholas, but contemporaries (even in official documents) exclusively called him \\"K√≥nya\\" after his drooping ears (lit. \\"lekonyul√≥\\"). He was born into the powerful Sz√©cs√©nyi family as the eldest son of Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi, Voivode of Transylvania and his first wife, an unidentified daughter of nobleman Paul Visontai from the gens Aba. His brothers were prelate Michael, Bishop of V√°c then Eger, and Stephen, who was mentioned only once in 1331. After their mother's death, Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi married to Anne, Duchess of Auschwitz. The marriage produced further three children, but all of them (K√≥nya's half- siblings: Caspar, Ladislaus I and Anne) died in their childhood.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Kacsics, 4. Sz√©cs√©nyi branch) K√≥nya first appeared in contemporary documents as a young courtier in 1327, when he already served as Master of the stewards for Queen Elizabeth, spouse of Charles I of Hungary. Despite his court function, he was not present on 17 April 1330, when Felician Z√°h, stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegr√°d with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. However K√≥nya Sz√©cs√©nyi's familiar, deputy master John Cselenfi stabbed the assassin and the arriving royal guards killed Felician. Sz√©cs√©nyi functioned as Master of the stewards in the Queen's Court until 1340. The ruins of the castle of Ecseg He became a staunch supporter of Louis I, who ascended the throne in 1342 after his father's death. The king's mother Elizabeth \\"acted as a sort of co-regent\\" for decades, because she exerted a powerful influence on him, which also resulted her courtier Sz√©cs√©nyi's growing influence. He actively participated in the Neapolitan campaigns of Louis the Great, residing in Italy for years. He was involved in the siege of Corato, leading a garrison composed of Hungarian and \\"Lombard\\" soldiers. He served as isp√°n of S√°ros and Szepes Counties from 1346 to 1349, and of N√≥gr√°d County from 1346 to 1350 (also possessing Szanda Castle as its honor). He was mentioned as castellan of Csejte Castle (today ƒåachtice in Slovakia) in 1354. Between 1354 and 1360, he served as isp√°n of G√∂m√∂r County and castellan of F√ºlek Castle (today in Fiƒæakovo, Slovakia). He was made isp√°n of Pozsony County, holding the dignity from 1360 to 1362. He finished his career as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia, serving in this capacity from 1366 until his death in the next year. K√≥nya Sz√©cs√©nyi married Elizabeth Haschendorfer, a daughter of Austrian noble Wulfing I Haschendorfer from Haschendorf/Hasfalva (today part of Neckenmarkt in Austria). After her brother Wulfing II was killed in the Siege of Zadar (1346) and left no male heirs, King Louis granted the status of a son to Elizabeth in 1347, authorizing her to inherit her father's landed property. As a result of this, Sz√©cs√©nyi acquired the castle of Ecseg and other estates through his wife, which after then belonged to the Holl√≥k≈ë lordship (and soon it was demolished by the Sz√©cs√©nyis themselves). The couple had three sons: Frank, Nicholas I and Simon. Frank and Simon became notable barons during the reign of Sigismund of Luxembourg, who continued to expand family wealth and held important dignities, while Nicholas, who owned the village of Cered, was last mentioned in 1383, possibly died around that year.

A successful and durable international campaigner, he won important races in each of his four seasons of racing and competed in Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Dubai, Ireland and Australia. As a two-year-old in 2008 he showed great promise as he won the Royal Lodge Stakes and was placed in the Racing Post Trophy and Prix La Rochette. He had a delayed start to his second campaign but established himself as a top-class middle-distance performer with wins in the Rose of Lancaster Stakes, Grand Prix de Deauville and Preis von Europa as well as finishing second in the Canadian International Stakes. He won the Jockey Club Stakes at four but showed his best form a five-year-old when he won the Fred Archer Stakes, Prix Kergorlay and Irish St Leger. He failed to recover fully from an injury sustained in the Melbourne Cup and was retired to become a breeding stallion in Germany. Background Jukebox Jury is a grey horse bred in Ireland by Paul Nataf. As a yearling in August, the colt (then officially described as bay) was sent to the Arqana sale at Deauville where he was bought for ‚Ç¨270,000 by the trainer Mark Johnston. The colt subsequently entered the ownership of Alan Spence and was taken into training with Johnston at his Middleham stable. He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Montjeu whose wins included the Prix du Jockey Club, Irish Derby, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. As a breeding stallion his other progeny included Motivator, Authorized, Pour Moi, Camelot, Scorpion, Hurricane Fly, St Nicholas Abbey and Hurricane Run. Jukebox Jury's dam Mare Aux Fees, from whom he inherited his grey coat, showed no racing ability but did better as a broodmare, producing several other winners including the Prix Vanteaux winner Belle Allure. She came from a largely French family which had produced several good winners including Tropique (Eclipse Stakes), Lightning (Prix d'Ispahan) and Soleil Noir (Grand Prix de Paris). Racing career =2008: two-year-old season= Jukebox Jury began his racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Goodwood Racecourse on 2 August in which he was ridden by Johnny Murtagh and started a 14/1 outsider. After racing towards the rear of the field he made progress on the outside, caught the leaders in the closing stages and won by a neck despite looking \\"green\\" (inexperienced) and hanging right near the finish. Fifteen days later the colt was sent to France and moved up in class for the Listed Prix Fran√ßois Boutin over 1400 metres at Deauville Racecourse and finished fourth, seven lengths behind the Richard Hannon Sr.-trained Soul City after hanging left in the last 200 metres. He returned to France on 7 September for the Group 3 Prix La Rochette at Longchamp in which he was again matched against Soul City. He was again beaten by the Hannon colt but produced a much better as he stayed on well to take third place, half a length and three-quarters of a length behind Soul City and Milanais. The Group 2 Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot Racecourse saw Jukebox Jury start the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Cityscape, Orizaba (winner of the Vintage Stakes) and the Henry Cecil-trained On Our Way. After being restrained at the rear of the field in the early stages by his jockey Royston Ffrench the colt began to make progress approaching the final turn and was switched to the outside to make his challenge in the straight. He caught Cityscape 30 yards from the finish and won by three-quarters of a length. Ffrench was again in the saddle when the colt was stepped up to Group 1 class and started 2/1 favourite for the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster on 25 October. He stayed on well in the straight but was hampered a furlong from the finish and was beaten into second place by Crowded House. =2009: three-year-old season= Jukebox Jury missed the spring of 2009 and made little impact on his seasonal debut when he finished last of seven in the Prix Daphnis over 1800 metres at Longchamp on 22 June. In a strongly contested edition of the Eclipse Stakes on 4 July he started a 50/1 outsider and came home sixth of the ten runners behind Sea the Stars. In August the colt was dropped back to Group 3 class for the Rose of Lancaster Stakes at Haydock Park and started 6/1 fourth choice in the betting. He was among the early leaders before being pulled back by Ffrench and then renewing his challenge in the straight. He overtook the favourite Campanologist inside the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths with the John Gosden-trained Duncan taking third place. Ten days after his win at Haydock Jukebox Jury contested the Great Voltigeur Stakes over one and a half miles at York Racecourse and finished fourth behind Monitor Closely, Mastery and Father Time after stumbling a quarter of a mile from the finish. The colt was back in action less than two weeks later in France when he contested the Grand Prix de Deauville against older horses and started at odds of 9/4 against five opponents including Ideal World (Prix de Reux) and Kasbah Bliss (Prix Gladiateur). Jukebox Jury took the early lead and then settled in second behind Kasbah Bliss before regaining the advantage 300 metres from home. He just held off a late challenge from Pouvoir Absolu to prevail by a nose in a photo finish. Johnston commented \\"It wasn't the idea to make the running and Jukebox Jury is not the ideal horse for it, so we were delighted when Kasbah Bliss went on. We have had our eyes on the Canadian International since he won at Haydock, but for the moment we'll keep all our options open\\". Jukebox Jury was moved up to Group 1 level when he was sent to Germany for the Preis von Europa over 2400 metres at Cologne on 27 September in which he again faced older opponents. He was made joint-favourite with the Sheema Classic winner Eastern Anthem just ahead of the Hardwicke Stakes winner Bronze Cannon with the best of the others appearing to be Toughness Danon (Furstenberg- Rennen), Enroller (John Porter Stakes) and Eliot (fourth in the German Derby). The colt started quickly before settling in second place behind Enroller and then went to the front 400 metres from the finish. Eastern Anthem produced a sustained effort but Jukebox Jury prevailed by a nose with a gap of two and a half lengths back to Eliot in third place. For his final run of the season, as Johnston had predicted, Jukebox Jury was sent to Canada for the Pattison Canadian International at Woodbine Racetrack on 17 October. Ridden as usual by Ffrench he raced in second place before taking the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten half a length by the six-year- old Champs Elysees. In the 2009 World Thoroughbred Rankings, Jukebox Jury was given a rating of 118, making him the 87th best racehorse in the world and the best British three-year-old colt in the Long-distance division. =2010: four- year-old season= In early 2010, Jukebox Jury was sent to Dubai for the Sheema Classic at Meydan Racecourse on 27 March in which he finished fifteenth of the sixteen runners behind Dar Re Mi after fading badly in the straight. On his return to Europe he contested the Jockey Club Stakes over one and a half miles at Newmarket Racecourse on 1 May and started the 13/8 favourite against four opponents, namely Claremont (Prix du Lys), Nanton (Mallard Stakes), Drill Sergeant (Duke of Edinburgh Stakes) and Halicarnassus (Bosphorus Cup). After racing in second place behind Drill Sergeant, Ffrench sent Jukebox Jury to the front with half a mile left and the colt kept on well to win by almost four lengths from Nanton. Jukebox Jury was well beaten in his next two races, finishing seventh to Fame and Glory in the Coronation Cup and ninth to Harbinger in the Hardwicke Stakes. When sent to Germany for the Deutschland Preis at Hamburg on 17 July he produced a better effort as he finished fourth to Campanologist, beaten less than a length by the winner. The 2010 World Thoroughbred Rankings saw Jukebox Jury drop to 178 in the rankings with a mark of 116. =2011: five-year-old season= After an absence of more than eleven months, Jukebox Jury returned in the Listed Fred Archer Stakes at Newmarket on 25 June in which he was ridden for the first time by Neil Callan. The Grand Prix de Paris winner Cavalryman started favourite with Jukebox Jury starting at odds of 11/2 in an eight-runner field which also included Allied Powers (Grand Prix de Chantilly) and Afsare (Hampton Court Stakes). In a change of tactics, he led from the start and stayed to win by three-quarters of a length from Cavalryman and Afsare who dead-heated for second place. In the Glorious Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse a month later, Jukebox Jury partially recovered after being boxed against the inside rail to finish third, beaten a head and a neck by Drunken Sailor and Harris Tweed. In an exceptionally strong renewal of the Prix Kergorlay over 3000 metres at Deauville on 21 August, he started at odds of 5/1 in a thirteen-runner field which included Americain, Dunaden, Red Cadeaux, Kasbah Bliss, Gentoo (Prix du Cadran, Prix Royal Oak), Brigantin (Prix de Lut√®ce) and Manighar (Prix Chaudenay). Jukebox Jury led from the start, switched left in the straight and drew away from his rivals to win by three lengths from Kasbah Bliss. Johnston commented \\"The plan was to make the pace, he set a strong one and kicked off the bend. He loves it here\\" while Callan added, \\"The horse is very adaptable and I just let him bowl along in front, he enjoyed it when I let him do it when he won first-time-out this season.\\" The Irish St Leger at the Curragh on 10 September attracted a field of six runners and Jukebox Jury, ridden by Johnny Murtagh started 4/1 second choice in the betting behind the odds-on favourite Fame and Glory. The other four runners were Duncan, Red Cadeaux, Fictional Account (Irish St Leger Trial Stakes) and the 100/1 outsider Waydownsouth. Jukebox Jury led from the start and appeared to be dominating the race before Duncan (ridden by Eddie Ahern) moved up alongside him in the straight. The two horses raced head to head in the last quarter mile and crossed the line together. After examining the photo finish, the racecourse judges declared a dead heat. On his final appearance of the season the horse was sent to Australia to contest the Melbourne Cup over 3200 metres at Flemington Racecourse on 1 November. Before the race a share in the horse was acquired by the Australian owners Kevin Bamford, Colleen Bamford and Gerry Ryan. Carrying a weight of 126 pounds (the second highest in the race) he finished in 20th place in the 23 runner field having sustained a hairline fracture to the cannon bone of his left foreleg. Jukebox Jury remained in training in 2012 but suffered another setback and was retired from racing in September. Stud career At the end of his racing career, Jukebox Jury became a breeding stallion at the Gestut Etzean near Beerfelden in Germany. In December 2017 he moved to stand at Burgage Stud in Leighlinbridge Ireland. He had his first Grade 1 winner just 3 months later at the Cheltenham festival when Farclas won the triumph hurdle for Gordon Elliot.

The genus name Lucianovenator translates to \\"Luciano's hunter\\", in reference Don Luciano Leyes, who first reported the remains. The species name bonoi refers to Tulio del Bono, a local scientific authority who collaborated on the describers' research. It is one of the few neotheropods known from South America. Discovery The holotype (PVSJ 906) of Lucianovenator bonoi was found in the \\"Quebrada del puma\\" locality of the Quebrada del Barro formation in Argentina, which is estimated to be from the late Norian to Rhaetian in age, approximately 210 to 202 million years ago. PVSJ 906 represents an articulated vertebral sequence from the third cervical to fourth dorsal vertebra, as well as a sacrum and a partial pelvis. In addition, three more specimens were referred to Lucianovenator. These include PVSJ 899 (a sacrum and partial pelvis), PVSJ 1013 (a sacrum), and PVSJ 1084 (a sacrum and partial pelvis). PVSJ 1004, the proximal end of a right tibia, may also belong to the species. Description As with other neotheropods, the cervical vertebrae of Lucianovenator possess a complex system of fossae (pits) and laminae (ridges) that connect the main body of each vertebrae (centra), front and rear joint plates (pre- and post- zygapophyses), and top and bottom rib facets (diapophyses and pleurapophyses) to each other. Although the cervicals of Lucianovenator possess many fossae, four particular examples of paired fossae (four on each side of the vertebrae) can be used to distinguish it from other neotheropods. The first of these is deep pit located directly at the base of each prezygapophysis, and the second is a larger pit is located immediately behind it. These two pits are obscured by a ridge known as a prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal lamina, which connects each prezygapophysis to the each diapophysis, and each diapophysis to the rear portion of the centrum. A third fossa is located at the rear portion of the vertebra. It too is obscured from the side, this time by the centropostzygapophyseal lamina which connects each postzygapophysis to the rear portion of the centrum. Each of the third fossae connects to a pair of large internal cavities which lie adjacent to the canal for the spinal cord. This combination of features is unique to Lucianovenator, as no other coelophysoid possesses all of these features at once. The first and third pairs of fossae are similar to those of \\"Syntarsus\\" kayentakatae, but the second pair is not. The third pair does connect to internal cavities in Coelophysis bauri, but so does the first pair, unlike the case in Lucianovenator. Another of Lucianovenator's distinguishing traits is that the anterior cervical ribs are very long (more than five times as long as the cervical centra). The fourth diagnostic pair of cervical fossae in Lucianovenator is also the only autapomorphy (unique distinguishing trait) of the genus. Lucianovenator is unique in the fact that the edge of each centrodiapophyseal lamina (which connects each diapophysis to the centrum) acquires a long and deep pit, which becomes progressively longer and deeper towards the base of the neck. In cervical 9, the pit is nearly the entire length of the centrodiapophyseal lamina, and is so deep that it is not completely visible from the side. Classification A phylogenetic analysis published along with the description of Lucianovenator assigned it to the Coelophysidae, in a clade with Coelophyis rhodesiensis and Camposaurus. This clade is supported by a single feature, the fact that the zygapophyses of the sacral vertebrae are fused. The authors of the paper suggested that the relative rarity of theropods in Rhaetian deposits compared to Norian deposits may be the result of taphonomic bias rather than a decline in diversity.

Wilson, A woman of the century Zara A. Wilson (born October 8, 1840) was a reformer and lawyer. Early life and family Isaac Mahurin Zara Mahurin was born in Burnettsville, Indiana, on October 8, 1840. She was the fourth in a family of eight children. Her maiden name was Mahurin, to which form it had been Americanized from the Scotch Mac Huron. Her father, Caleb Mahurin (1786-1859), was of southern birth and education, a native of North Carolina. He was twice married, his second wife being Matilda C. Freeman (1809-1882), the mother of Wilson, to whom he was married near Troy, Ohio, in 1832. Wilson's early life was spent on a farm, but she had the advantages of a seminary education in an institution founded and presided over by a half- brother, Isaac Mahurin (August 16, 1814 - August 23, 1870), in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Her sister, Mathilda L. Mahurin, was assistant principal. The Methodist College opened in 1852 and closed in 1863 when the Union Army claimed most of its students. The old brick building was on West Street and US 24. Matilda L. Mahurin Mathilda L. Mahurin (November 11, 1827 - April 16, 1916) was for many years a resident of Indianapolis, and taught in the public school there for many years. She was born in Miami County, Ohio, on November 11, 1827, and moved to Indiana with her parents when she was a girl. She began teaching when a young woman, being for a time connected with the Methodist College at Fort Wayne. She moved to Indianapolis in 1867 and lived with her sister, Mary Kilbun Robinson (1821-1909), whose home was at 603 North New Jersey Street. Mathilda Mahurin was an active member of Meridian Street M.E. Church and died at Elkhart, Indiana. Zara Mahurin had always shown a fondness for books, and during her student days mathematics was to her a fascinating study. Career At the age of seventeen Zara Mahurin began to teach. After one year in Fort Wayne College, then in thriving condition, she became assistant in that school. The sudden death of her father called her home to the support of a sorrowing mother, whom she assisted, during the next year, in the settlement of a large estate. Then she resumed teaching and served with success in Lafayette and other towns of Indiana. In Lafayette, Indiana, Wilson took her first public stand in favor of the equality of sex, refusing to accept a position as principal because the salary offered was ten dollars per month less than was paid to a man for the same work. She had already suffered from the disability custom had laid upon her sex. She had, in her earnest longing to do good, a strong desire to enter the ministry, but found that, because of sex, she would not be admitted to the Biblical Institute in Evansville, Indiana. Wilson organized the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Goodland, Indiana, and was corresponding secretary of that district until, her health demanding change of climate, the family home was removed to Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1870. She gradually improved in the climate of Nebraska. She was district corresponding secretary of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Nebraska. Wilson was an efficient member of the Nebraska Woman's Christian Temperance Union, delivering addresses and publishing state reports. She was three times elected corresponding secretary of the Nebraska body, resigning because of overwork. For four years she was a member of the national convention. She was State superintendent or franchise for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In the fall of 1892 she was a candidate on the prohibition ticket for county attorney. Wilson was always active in the cause of woman's advancement and was a warm advocate of woman's political enfranchisement, wielding a ready pen in its favor. Since her admission to the bar, in 1891, she made the legal status of women a specialty, and she wrote in that line for the press. She is the author of A Concise Compilation of Nebraska Laws, Of Special Interest to Women (1891). In 1897 Wilson was nominated for Supreme Court justice by the Liberty Party, a Nebraska third- party organization. Personal life In the year 1867, Zara Mahurin married Port Wilson, a merchant of Goodland, Indiana. Owing to broken health, her energies were for ten years confined mostly to home duties and the care of her only child, a son.

History The bank was established in April 1834 by the industrialist James Foster with an office in High Street, Stourbridge. The building had been Foster's residence before his move to Stourton Castle. Originally called \\"Park House\\", it became known as \\"Bank House\\" after its conversion into offices. The first manager, John Amery and first cashier, Samuel Nock had living quarters in the bank building itself. Amery had been recruited from the Birmingham branch of the Bank of England. On formation, the bank had paid-up capital of ¬£34,000. James Foster remained as chairman until 1850. In June 1834 a branch was opened at Kidderminster. In the same year it opened a branch in Bromsgrove and took over the business of Oldaker, Tomes and Chattaway in Stratford-on- Avon. The Bromsgrove branch was initially only open for 1 day per week, but in 1851, the company of Rufford Biggs failed, and the Stourbridge and Kidderminster obtained their premises at 93 High Street, Bromsgrove.

Cloete"},{"id":"54878375","text":"The Danzig Street shooting or Danzig shooting was a Canadian gang-related shooting. It occurred on the evening of 16 July 2012 at a block party on Danzig Street in the West Hill neighbourhood of Toronto. Rival gang members Folorunso Owusu, 17, and Nahom Tsegazab, 19, along with an unidentified third gunman, opened fire in a crowd of two hundred people. This resulted in the deaths of Joshua Yasay and Shyanne Charles, and the injury of twenty-four others (including two of the perpetrators), making it the worst mass shooting in Toronto. A 2008 provincial report had warned of increasing trends in youth violence but key recommendations to help keep at-risk youth from joining gangs had not been adopted. Around 2010 the West Hill-based Galloway Boys gang was reforming, recruiting youth who obtained guns used in conflicts for territory and leadership. Some of these youths held a party with free alcohol following a children's barbecue at a social housing complex. After a series of confrontations, threats escalated into the shooting. Although initially believed to be the resumption of a 2003 gang war between the Galloway Boys and the Malvern Crew, it later became clear that the Danzig Street shooting was not part of a territorial dispute or retaliation for another incident but a disagreement between teenagers who decided to have a gunfight in the middle of a party. Police initially received few tips from frightened witnesses but were able to make two arrests that month; two additional arrests came following a reprisal shooting in September. The four young men convicted were aged 15 to 19 at the time of the shooting; two were minors and their names were withheld under the Youth Criminal Justice Act until they were sentenced as adults. Justice Ian Nordheimer said of the incident, \\"Ordinary persons do not understand how anyone, much less teenagers, can come not only to possess such weapons, but to use them in such a brutal and indifferent way.\\" The incident made headlines around the world and, in conjunction with the Eaton Centre shooting six weeks earlier and a shooting in a Colorado movie theatre four days later, renewed debate on gun crime in urban areas. Despite falling national crime rates a poll taken the following week showed that a majority of Canadians were in fear of \\"a violent crime wave\\". The shooting led the Toronto Police Service to develop new crime-prevention strategies for the Neighbourhood Officers program, established to build community relationships in at-risk areas to gain information on local crime, making possible targeted crackdowns on gang activity and a dramatic reduction in shootings and other crimes. Police 43 Division (which includes Danzig Street) reported no homicides in 2013. Background The Galloway Boys ( G-Way) were one of the most notoriously violent criminal gangs in Toronto, their turf centered on the intersection of Galloway and Kingston Roads in the neighbourhood of West Hill. They terrorized Scarborough in 2003 and 2004 while battling with rival gang the Malvern Crew over territory for street drugs and prostitution. The deadly turf war resulted in Ontario's largest street-gang crackdown and prosecutions, with 75 arrests of alleged gang members on more than 600 criminal charges. With the gang's leadership locked away, there was a dramatic decrease in violent crime. However, many of those gang leaders had been sentenced to five- or seven-year jail terms, and when they were released back into the community around 2010, they began mentoring youths recruited into the gang. The younger members obtained guns and used them in conflicts for control of the gang and territory, resulting in a string of shootings and killings in 2011 and 2012. By September 2012 there was a 22% increase in shooting incidents and a 41% increase in shooting victims in the city. In Toronto, blockos are a form of block party based on a tradition of outdoor gatherings in the West Indies. They are held by neighbours and outreach workers, particularly during the city's warm, humid summers. Daytime activities are focused on children, and the evenings provide an alternative for residents who cannot afford to go out to restaurants, clubs, etc. Since the 1970s many blockos have been held each year at Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) developments without incident. The 101-unit townhouse social housing complex at Danzig Street and Morningside Avenue is called Morningside Coronation by TCHC and D-Block by the young families that reside there. Alcohol is prohibited in common areas without a special-occasion permit. There is a strict no-gun policy: anyone caught with a gun is turned over to police, and tenants caught housing someone with a gun are evicted. Event =Block party= A blocko was organized at the Danzig Street housing complex for 15 July 2012 by resident Shannon Longshaw, a 28-year-old mother of two, as an afternoon children's barbecue. Meanwhile, from 7 July the Twitter account @2ToneShorty, linked to 19-year-old Nahom Tsegazab, a Galloway Boys member known as \\"Gifted\\", had been promoting the gathering as a \\"HennessyBlock Party\\". The messages promised a live DJ and 30 bottles of Hennessy cognac on ice, free for all. Over the course of a week, more than two dozen open invitations were sent from the account and spread across social media as #hennessyblockparty. Some residents made Twitter posts expressing concerns over the potential for violence. The party, which was delayed to Monday 16 July due to a rainstorm, began in Longshaw's backyard at 2 pm. Tenants chipped in, provided food, and ran activities for area children such as face painting and putting a water sprinkler on playground equipment for a makeshift water slide. Tsegazab handed out school supplies and basketballs. The children's party was to end at 5 pm, but by then adults were already gathering in the parking lot, and the Galloway Boys \\"took ownership\\" of the blocko. By 7 pm the crowd had grown thicker and alcohol was being consumed to loud hip hop music. An hour later there were Jaguars and Hummers parked around the block, marijuana smoke in the air, and more than 200 people packing the complex's narrow internal lane. Worried about people they did not know, some residents took their children inside their homes. One resident could not use the walkway without bumping into people, describing it as being like a jammed nightclub. Several noise complaints were made to police, and bicycle patrols were dispatched, but the party was allowed to continue. According to Gene Jones, then-CEO of TCHC, the event had not been sanctioned by TCHC and should have ended before 9 pm. =Provocations= The crowd in the complex's lane was filling in when the Galloway Boys began \\"G-checking\\", confronting people they did not recognize and telling those from rival gang territories to leave. 18-year-old Shaquan Mesquito of Malvern, an alleged Malvern Crew member known as \\"Bam Bam\\", who had come to the party unarmed, was ordered to leave by Tsegazab's 15-year-old brother Naod. Naod threatened to shoot Mesquito if he did not leave immediately. Angry at being forced to leave, Mesquito sent out a number of Twitter posts urging others to go on a killing spree and shoot up the party. Shortly after 9 pm, Nahom Tsegazab was warned about these threats. Tsegazab then armed himself with a .40 calibre pistol and told others to be prepared for a possible shootout. =Shooting= 17-year-old Folorunso Owusu, a Le Side Crew gang member, arrived at the party and was confronted by Nahom Tsegazab, who displayed a handgun and challenged Owusu to fight if he did not leave. At approximately 10:40 pm, less than two minutes after arriving at the party, Owusu opened fire and shot Nahom Tsegazab twice with a 9 mm handgun. One of these bullets passed through Tsegazab and injured a bystander. Nahom Tsegazab was shot in the right biceps and abdomen. He fell to the ground in front of 207 Danzig Street and reached for his gun, recklessly firing eleven rounds at Owusu, who retreated through the crowd. One of these bullets struck Owusu in the leg. A third shooter, who remains unidentified, fired fourteen rounds from an Uzi submachine-gun into the crowd. Twenty-four bystanders were shot, two fatally, and three people were trampled by the panicked crowd. The shooting victims were aged 22 months to 33 years. Shyanne Charles, 14, was fleeing from the initial gunfire when she ran into the line of fire of the third shooter. She was struck by several bullets and collapsed and died on the doorstep of 203 Danzig Street. Joshua Yasay, 23, a community mentor with an honours degree in criminology who aspired to be a police officer, was shot by a bullet that pierced his heart and lungs. It has not been determined whether Tsegazab or the third shooter killed him. The other shooting victims include: *Kimanio Allen *Erica Boateng *Ashley Codrington *Melissa Coley *Jozelle Garcia *Stavon Hibbert *Angie Hutchinson, who was shot in the leg. *Ann Jeanette *Amira Joseph-Athanas, 19, was shot twice, in her lower back and arm. *Dedier Kalonji *Marlon King, a promising basketball player, was shot through the hand. *Amara Koroma *Enrequija Mamaril, a.k.a. Mama Kathy, was shot in the leg. *Nikisha McKenzie *Kayla Myers *Nicole Ormsby *Jhane Ottey *Stacey Smith *Shalanda Spencer *Devontae Thomas, a 22-month-old toddler, later known as \\"lucky boy\\", was grazed across the top of his skull. *Ivelaw Vaughn A pregnant woman was hospitalized after being trampled during the panic that followed the shooting. Aftermath and initial arrests The injured were taken to five area hospitals by sixteen ambulances and an bus. In May 2015 a team of paramedics were honoured for their actions during the shooting. Investigators found more than 25 fired shell casings at the scene and recovered five firearms. 30 alcohol bottles were picked up after the shooting. Police, community workers, and the media suspected that the shooting was between members of the Galloway Boys and the Malvern Crew, having anticipated a violent clash as some senior members of the rival gangs were being released from prison. Two and a half hours after the shooting on Danzig Street, there was a shooting at another TCHC complex on Whiteleas Avenue, away. Two bullets were fired through the front window of the house where Mesquito lived with his mother. No one was injured. On 19 July, while being treated at hospital, Nahom Tsegazab was charged with reckless discharge of a firearm in relation to the Danzig Street shooting. Mesquito was arrested on 27 July for two counts of uttering threats to cause serious bodily harm at the block party. At the time of his arrest, Mesquito was found carrying a loaded .22 calibre revolver for which he was charged with nine weapons-related offenses. Later that summer Mesquito's family were evicted by TCHC for a lease violation, possibly stemming from these charges. In the search for gunmen, police executed a series of vehicle inspections, checks on parolees, and search warrants in the week of 29 July - 4 August, during the course of which over twenty firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition were seized. There were concerns about violence during the 4 August Caribana parade, which attracts one million people, and which had been the site of a fatal shooting in 2011. =Social media= Initial reports from the shooting came via Twitter posts from witnesses and victims. Within hours of the shooting, Twitter was flooded with posts referencing \\"Ledda\\" in connection with 14-year-old victim Shyanne Charles, warning that Ledda would seek out those responsible for the violence. \\"This is just the beginning. Touched the wrong people,\\" read another message. Police also looked into whether a rap video posted two days before the shooting may have been related. As part of the investigation, police went through thousands of text messages and intercepted phone calls to rebuild the sequence of events. Among these messages were several in which Mesquito claimed responsibility for the shooting. Investigation and later arrests Police were met with silence in many areas as they asked for witnesses to come forward, receiving few tips despite so many people having been witnesses to, or victims of, the events. The investigation gained momentum within a few weeks while the Summer Safety Initiative was launched to confront gangs and violence, putting officers on foot patrol in high-crime areas. Officers built relationships with residents of these communities, where some had a historic distrust of police and fears of gang retaliation. A related shooting occurred on 2 September at a TCHC townhouse complex on Chester Le Boulevard. Naod Tsegazab had tracked down Owusu to retaliate for trying to kill his brother, Nahom. However, Naod only shot Owusu once in the leg before his gun jammed. As a result of the shooting, a search warrant was carried out on Owusu's Chester Le Boulevard home, leading to cocaine trafficking charges. Naod was charged with the attempted murder of Owusu. The first murder charge of the Danzig Street shooting investigation was made against Mesquito on 7 November. He was charged with the attempted murder of Nahom Tsegazab, two counts of first-degree murder and 23 counts of aggravated assault. Later that month Nahom Tsegazab was charged with two counts of second-degree murder and 22 counts of aggravated assault. Owusu was arraigned with similar charges at the end of November. As the fourth person charged in connection with the Danzig Street shooting, Naod was charged on 4 December with threatening death and weapons offenses but not murder. On 23 January 2015 the murder and assault charges against Mesquito were dropped after police uncovered evidence that he was in an apartment building away at the time of the shooting. Mesquito had continued to claim credit for the shooting throughout the 30 months he was in custody. His lawyer suggested that since Mesquito had called for people to shoot up the party, he may have thought people close to him had done it and so took responsibility. In fact, no connection was found between Mesquito and Owusu, who had initiated the shooting. The defense lawyer praised police and the Crown Attorney, and stated that he had never before been involved in a case where law enforcement, the prosecution, and the defence had worked together to uncover the facts. Convictions Nahom Tsegazab pleaded guilty on 11 April 2014 to two counts of manslaughter and six counts of aggravated assault, and was sentenced to fourteen years in prison. Tsegazab admitted that in participating in the gunfight he was a party to all the deaths and injuries that ensued. Shaquan Mesquito pleaded guilty on 23 January 2015 to counselling to commit murder, possession of a firearm, breach of a prohibition order, and uttering a threat. He was sentenced to nine years in prison (less time served). Although no connection was found to link Mesquito with Owusu, it was determined that Mesquito's threats to revisit the block party and \\"shoot it up\\" had put the Galloway Boys on a \\"hair trigger\\". Naod Tsegazab pleaded guilty in 2016 to the attempted murder of Owusu in the 2 September Chester Le Boulevard shooting, carried out in the belief that Owusu had shot his brother. He was sentenced as an adult to seven years in prison. Folorunso Owusu pleaded not guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, one count of attempted murder against Nahom Tsezagab, two counts of aggravated assault, and one charge of reckless discharging of a firearm. The defence maintained during the seven-week trial that Owusu was innocent and a victim of circumstance, shot while attending the party. The Crown provided a recording of Naod Tsegazab in the courthouse cells identifying Owusu, by nickname, as his brother's shooter. However, Naod testified that he invented the story to look tougher in jail, and Nahom Tsegazab testified that Owusu did not shoot him. Found guilty, Owusu was sentenced as an adult to life in prison on 7 December 2016. None of the bullets Owusu fired had killed anyone, but his actions had initiated the gunfire that killed two and injured twenty-two bystanders. In May 2017 Owusu was found guilty of criminal negligence charges, which had been severed in a pre-trial motion, and sentenced to four years, to be served concurrently with the life sentence. With time served, he is eligible for parole in 2019. Effects =Crime and policing= The 16 July Danzig Street shooting was the worst mass shooting in Toronto, and occurred just six weeks after the Eaton Centre shooting. The event made headlines around the world and prompted renewed debate on gun crime in urban areas. Two other deadly shooting incidents in the city followed within three days, and three shootings occurred that Friday night. That same evening a lone gunman opened fire in a Colorado movie theatre, killing twelve. Although data showed crime was decreasing nationally, a 25‚Äì26 July Forum Research poll for the National Post suggested that Canadians believed otherwise. The recent mass shootings and media coverage had a majority fearing \\"a violent crime wave\\". Pamela Rutledge, a media researcher studying the psychological impact of news coverage, stated that the apparent randomness of the crimes could lead to this perception. \\"They really trigger a sense of fear in us because they aren't explainable [...] There's no way of making sense of it or figuring out why it didn't happen to me. So that anxiety accelerates your sense of danger.\\" The Toronto Police Service established a strong uniform presence at Danzig Street, Kingston‚ÄìGalloway, and other areas that struggle with gang violence, in an attempt to stop acts of revenge. This was extended with the Summer Safety Initiative, a seven-week program of mandatory overtime that effectively added more than 300 officers to patrols. The program emphasized \\"old-school policing\\", with officers walking street patrols in high-crime areas, building relationships with residents and the community. During these summer weeks, which typically see a spike in shootings and other crime, shooting deaths declined from a seven-year average of 6.4 to 2, with dramatic drops in other violent crime categories. The initiative cost $2 million, though Police Chief Bill Blair said it saved money by preventing crimes that are expensive to investigate. The 2012 Summer Safety Initiative led to crime-prevention strategies and the development in 2013 of the Neighbourhood Officers program, which focuses on high-crime areas in each of Toronto's seventeen police divisions. In the program, officers are dedicated to a specific area for a period of at least two years, shifting away from enforcement-based policing to building relationships with residents, learning of specific issues affecting the communities, and improving intelligence about local crime. The provincially-funded TAVIS (Toronto Anti-violence Intervention Strategy) program saw a similar shift in focus, having faced controversy for a practice of stopping, questioning, and documenting people - a procedure known as \\"carding\\" - which resulted in community distrust. The shooting brought an offer from Customs and Immigration officers to patrol with Toronto Police in hunts for gunmen. A liaison officer was established so police could quickly obtain immigration information on suspects. Nahom Tsegazab had arrived in Canada as a refugee from Somalia. Violent crime rates dropped in the year following the shooting, and in 2013 there were no homicides in 43 Division (southeast Scarborough, including Danzig Street), which recorded falling crime rates in every category. Deputy Chief of Police Peter Sloly credited the declining crime rates to several actors: the city, non-profit organizations, volunteers, youth outreach workers, community organizations, and a new victim and witness support program. In 2015 community policing officers reported feeling more welcome and receiving more information from residents, intelligence that allowed police to implement a more \\"surgical policing model\\" that was less invasive on the community. Toronto Police Association President Mike McCormack said of the Danzig Street shooting: \\"It changed the way we gather intelligence, do investigations and it really brought the whole issue of gang culture and some of the challenges that we have in policing to the forefront.\\" =Gang crackdown= The Danzig Street shooting generated new intelligence for police of an internal leadership struggle for control of the Galloway Boys and a territorial dispute with the neighbouring Orton Park Boys. Police linked the Galloway Boys to eight shooting incidents between 4 September 2011 and 10 August 2012, including: * Domino's shooting (4 September 2011) - three men were shot outside a Domino's Pizza parlour at Lawrence Avenue East and Susan Street. * Northfield Drive shooting (4 November 2011) - a man was shot in the neck and chest during a drug deal on Northfield Drive off of Orton Park Road. Ramon Williams was charged with attempted murder. * Kingston Road drive-by (28 December 2011) - three young men were shot at 4315 Kingston Road in the territory of the Galloway Boys. * Murder of D'Mitre Barnaby (30 December 2011) - D'Mitre Barnaby was gunned down in the parking lot of the Susan Towers apartment building at 3847 Lawrence Avenue East, mistaken for the drive-by shooter. * 3827 Lawrence East shooting (15 January 2012) - several shots were fired on the second floor of an apartment. Blood was found at the scene, but no victim has been identified. * Danzig Street shooting (16 July 2012) * 4100 Lawrence East shooting (6 August 2012) - several shots were fired, with no known victims. * Lawrence LRT shooting (10 August 2012) - one of the emerging leaders of the Galloway Boys was chased through the Lawrence LRT station and gunned down against a fence, surviving with critical injuries. D'Mitre Barnaby's murder sparked a police crackdown on the Scarborough gangs. Project Brazen was carried out from April to September 2012, resulting in nine arrests, the seizure of five firearms, and attempted murder charges for four shootings. Homicide detectives and officers from Scarborough divisions reviewed the evidence and launched Project Quell in June 2013, identifying seven members of the Orton Park Boys and twenty-five members of the Galloway Boys, charging them with a total of 363 offenses. Search warrants were executed on 3 October in Toronto, London, and Waterloo, seizing more than of cocaine and $10,000 in drug proceeds. Project Quell officers confirmed that the Danzig Street investigation triggered investigations into the Galloway Boys and Orton Park. =Social programs= The Danzig Street shooting brought renewed attention to the report Roots of Youth Violence commissioned by the Ontario Liberal government following a fatal Toronto high school shooting in 2007. The report warned of \\"deeply troubling\\" increases in the frequency and severity of youth violence, and addressed children's mental health issues, poverty, racism, education, family issues, the justice system, and a lack of voice for youth. In August 2012 the Liberal government incorporated some of the recommendations in a $20 million action plan to curb youth violence. Nigerian-born businessman Akanimo Udofiya donated $150,000 over three years to help fund Our Space, a community drop-in centre established in a formerly vacant townhouse at 230 Danzig Street. The centre provided after-school programs, a homework club, hot meals for area youth, employment resources, and a base for the Danzig Residents Committee and community outreach programs. Toronto Community Housing donated space for the community hub, evicted one resident in connection with the shooting, and installed new lighting and twenty security cameras in May 2013. A number of memorial scholarships were created. York University set up the Joshua Yasay Award for excellence in criminology and community service. Two trusts were set up in Shyanne Charles' name, for scholarships starting at the elementary school level. =Rob Ford= Mayor Rob Ford called for the Danzig Street shooters to be expelled from the city, saying: \\"I want these people out of the city. And I'm not going to stop. Not put 'em in jail, then come back and you can live in the city. No. I want 'em out of the city. Go somewhere else. I don't want 'em living in the city anymore.\\" The day after the shooting, he added, \\"We must use every legal means to make life for these thugs miserable, to put them behind bars, or to run them out of town. We will not rest until being a gang member is a miserable, undesirable life.\\" Ford called for longer prison sentences and decried \\"hug a thug\\" social programs, voting against accepting federal grants worth more than $16 million. In 2013 Ford was the subject of a video scandal and admitted to smoking crack cocaine and associating with drug dealers. While campaigning for re-election in 2014, Ford visited Danzig Street on the second anniversary of the mass shooting, dodging questions about his own connection to drug dealers. Councillor Paula Fletcher criticized his attending the event: \\"You can't have it both ways ‚Äì you can't be part of it and then crusading to stop it ... You can't technically be condoning guns and gangs and then going out saying how terrible it is that people have been shot and killed.\\" =In media= Toronto Police Sergeant Rod Chung collaborated with local hip hop artist Promise to reach out to urban youth. With help from artists Kaid and Liya, they released a track titled \\"Make a Change\\", inspired by the Danzig Street shooting. Promise wrote the lyrics, which call for taking ownership of the city and an end to violence. The track premiered on 30 September 2012 on CKFG-FM, a black owned and operated commercial radio station, which hosted an on-air town hall meeting to continue discussions between the community, artists, and the police. The day after the Danzig Street shooting, Toronto-born rapper Drake tweeted his condolences to the families of Yasay and Charles. He rapped about this \\"one summer day that went horribly wrong\\" as a featured artist on Snoop Dogg's reggae track \\"No Guns Allowed\\": The track premiered live on Conan on 11 March 2013 and was released on 2 April 2013 as the third single from Snoop's album Reincarnated.

Cuntz, Itin√©raire d'Antonin, (Leipzig, 1929) (1990 ).Pierre Salama, Les voies romaines de l'Afrique du Nord, Alger, 1951 (with a map of 1949). about 10 miles from Aquae RegiaeTissot, Geogr., II, p.588. The Antonine Itinerary tells us that its neighbors were Germanieiana, tentatively identified with nearby Ksour-el- Ma√Øete and Aeliae thought by some to be nearby Henchir-Merelma. If these tentatively identifications are correct it would confirm the Antonine Itinerary description of them being way stations on the limes Africana Road. Bishopric Terento is not on the lists of the Episcopal See and so it is presumed that the town was actually the cathedra for the diocese of Forontoniana.

It was released by Tico Records in 1969. It is Palmieri's most overtly political album, with lyrics dealing with inequality, discrimination and social justice. Described as an \\"integrated discourse\\", i.e. a concept album, it combines the popular salsa dura style of the 1970s on side A with a more innovative approach to jazz experimentation on side B. Background and recording Throughout the 1960s, pianist Eddie Palmieri played an important role in the development of salsa with his conjunto La Perfecta. La Perfecta was one of the first Latin ensembles to feature multiple trombones, one of salsa's distinctive characteristics. The band's repertoire was inspired by Cuban and Puerto Rican dance-oriented styles such as guaracha, son, pachanga and bomba. In 1968, Palmieri disbanded La Perfecta in order to seek a more experimental approach incorporating funk and soul elements into his music. Palmieri and his new ensemble (still similar to La Perfecta, with Barry Rogers being replaced by Lewis Kahn) recorded a series of four albums for Tico that have been said to contain his \\"best sounding\\" work. These four albums were Champagne (1968), Justicia (1969), Superimposition (1970) and V√°monos Pa'l Monte (1971). The album was recorded at Incredible Sounds studio in New York during the winter season. According to Palmieri, it was so cold he had to wear gloves during the recording sessions. Lyrics and composition In Justicia, Palmieri demonstrates the two main traits of his music during the era, namely \\"a grounding in social issues\\" at the lyrical level, and \\"a continuous, insistent experimentation\\" at the musical level. The social aspect of the album is patent on the title track, which opens the album and has been said to \\"epitomize the salsa style\\".Gerard, Charley (2001). p. 112. Although uncredited, its lyrics were written by lead singer Ismael Quintana. Musically, it has been described as \\"a composition in which the guaracha predominates within a multiform and polyrhythmic salsa\\", and its lyrics call for justice for \\"boricuas\\" (Puerto Ricans) and \\"niche\\" (African-Americans). This social theme would be continued in Palmieri's performance at Sing Sing Prison (particularly the recitations), as well as the opener of V√°monos pa'l monte, titled \\"Revolt / La libertad, l√≥gico\\". Together with the title track, side A contains the more Latin-based pieces of the album, such as Rafael Hern√°ndez's bolero \\"Amor ciego\\" and Ignacio Pi√±eiro's son-rumba \\"Lindo yamb√∫\\". The folkloric-sounding \\"My Spiritual Indian\\" contains a trumpet solo by Alfredo \\"Chocolate\\" Armenteros.Gerard, Charley (2001). p. 111. Palmieri's experimental approach to Latin jazz is mostly contained on side B of the album. \\"Everything Is Everything\\" is based on a standard blues form, with strong North American influences and a rhythm section similar to that of the soul jazz groups of the 1960s. \\"Verdict on Judge Street\\" is an extended jazz waltz, with long instrumental solos and few Latin elements. Nonetheless, on piano, Palmieri reserved his left hand for guajeos (vamping) throughout the track, while his right hand played jazz chords, creating an ambiguous contrast. The practice of including Cuban music on side A and experimental/jazz music on side B would be continued on Superimposition.Gerard, Charley (2001). p. 116. Release The album was released by Tico Records in 1969. During the recording sessions, ownership of Tico Records passed from Morris Levy to George Goldner; only the latter was credited as producer. Fania Records, which later acquired the Tico Records catalogue, re-issued the album on CD in 2006. Artwork The album cover was designed by visual artist Ely Besalel, who had worked on many previous Latin and jazz albums for Roulette Records and Tico Records. The cover displays the album title in a \\"stark, bold typography\\" that has been said to represent \\"a timeless cry for justice\\". In the top left corner, a small picture of Palmieri sitting on the floor, \\"thinking, worrying\\", further reinforces the message of the album. The photograph was taken by Warren Flagler.Kapper, Art; Estivill, Miguel (1969). Justicia liner notes. New York, NY: Tico. Besalel, who had already worked with Palmieri, would go on to develop a longer lasting relationship with him, working on Superimposition, V√°monos pa'l monte and Unifinished Masterpiece. Reception and legacy On his book Latin Jazz, John Storm Roberts wrote a favourable review of Justicia, calling it \\"the beginning of a number of extraordinarily important Palmieri releases\\". Tony Wilds wrote a mixed review for AllMusic, describing the album as \\"interesting\\" but \\"only average for an Eddie Palmieri record, which is still heads above most, and probably essential listening\\". After its release, Justicia has a long-lasting impact on the thriving New York salsa scene, with numerous socially-conscious bands arising shortly after its release. Notable examples include Tony Pab√≥n's La Protesta and Manny Oquendo's Conjunto Libre. Oquendo had been a long-time member of Palmieri's band, playing in most of his albums, including Justicia.

Torelly was born in Rio Grande. He studied in a Jesuit boarding school in S√£o Leopoldo and attended medical school, before dropping out. In 1925, Torelly moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he wrote for several newspapers, such as O Globo and A Manh√£; there, he published humorous pieces, poking fun at politicians of the time. Torelly would leave A Manh√£ (The Morning) in 1926, founding his own humor newspaper, A Manha ( a pun with the former, meaning The Whining). Torelly was a member of the Brazilian Communist Party. He was arrested in 1935 because of his ties with the party, then illegal. He was released one year later. When the party recovered its legal status, in 1947, Torelly ran for councilman in the Rio de Janeiro city elections.

Early life Blanche Lindo was born on 9 December 1912 in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, the daughter of Percival Henriques \\"Percy\\" Lindo and Hilda Violet Lindo. Lindo was a product of cousin marriage, both her mother and father descendants of the Lindo family, a Sephardi Jewish family originally from Spain who suffered persecution for their religion, and so became New Christians. Ultimately, Blackwell's ancestor, Alexandre Lindo, would go onto settle in Kingston, Jamaica in the 18th century and he and his descendants would make their fortune there as merchants, financiers and planters. Lindo was educated in Kingston by a private tutor until, at sixteen, she was sent to Garrett Hall to further her studies. She wed Joseph Blackwell, of the Crosse & Blackwell fortune, in 1936 and their only child, Christopher Gordon Percy Blackwell, was born the following year.  Relationship with Ian Fleming  During her life Blackwell became known for her role as friend, mistress and muse to Ian Fleming who lived nearby in Jamaica. On first meeting Fleming at a dinner party the two did not immediately hit it off, but their friendship developed into a deeper and creative one. Fleming's marriage to Ann Charteris had suffered, owing to her disapproval of the James Bond novels, and she was often away from the couple's home in Jamaica. Blackwell is believed by some to have been the inspiration for some of Fleming's most memorable female characters, Pussy Galore and Honeychile Ryder. Her brother, Roy Lindo, sold land to Fleming and Coward for their Jamaican houses. Blackwell became friends with prominent figures and celebrities of the time, including Errol Flynn, whom she met when he was holidaying in Jamaica. She continued to be involved with her son's life and work, hosting parties and giving advice.  Death  Blackwell died in London on 8 August 2017 at the age of 104.

She was known to the general public as Lady Clarke, a title which she assumed after her husband's elevation to the baronetage in 1882. Early life and marriage Clarke was born at Doogalloook, a station on the Goulburn River near Yea, Victoria. She was the daughter of Charlotte Agnes (n√©e Cotton) and Peter Snodgrass. Her father, who died when she was 16, was an affluent landowner and a member of parliament. Her paternal grandfather was Kenneth Snodgrass, a British Army officer originally from Scotland, while her maternal grandfather ‚Äì the owner of Doogallook ‚Äì was the naturalist John Cotton. In 1873, aged 21, Janet married William Clarke, 41-year-old widower for whom she had previously worked as a governess. She was stepmother to the four children from his first marriage, and bore an additional eight children herself (two of which died young).Sylvia Morrissey, 'Clarke, Janet Marion (1851‚Äì1909)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/clarke-janet-marion-3224/text4857, published first in hardcopy 1969.

Their city residence was Cliveden, an equally massive mansion in East Melbourne that was completed in 1888. The couple were known for their lavish hospitality, hosting frequent balls, luncheons, dinners, and garden parties. Many singers and musicians got their starts by being asked to perform at these events. During the depression of the early 1890s, Clarke also ran a soup kitchen out of Cliveden. In 1882, Clarke was involved in the creation of the Ashes urn, the trophy awarded to the winner of the Test cricket series between Australia and England. During their 1882‚Äì83 tour of Australia, Ivo Bligh were invited to spend Christmas at Rupertswood ‚Äì Sir William being the president of the Melbourne Cricket Club. As a joke, Clarke presented Bligh with a small urn, in which the ashes of a burnt bail had been placed.

Abigail \\"Abbey\\" Perkins Cheney (born November 18, 1851) was a musical educator. Early life Abbey (also Abigail or Abbie) Perkins was born on November 18, 1851, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Perkins inherited her rare gifts through her mother, from a long line of singing ancestors, the Cheneys of Vermont, who for a hundred years had been famous for their fine and powerful voices and exceptional musical culture. Her mother, Elizabeth Ela Cheney (born February 23, 1823 in Brentwood, New York), had a remarkably pure and strong mezzo-soprano voice, and was very successful before her marriage touring with her brothers, as a church and concert singer in Buffalo, New York, and subsequently in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and in Leavenworth, Kansas. In her old age, she still enjoyed the musical and literary pleasures of her daughter's San Francisco home. Perkins's father, Charles Wesley Perkins, one of the enterprising young business men of Milwaukee in the 1850s, was also a music lover. He died in 1861, and his last words to his little daughter were: \\"Lose no opportunity to cultivate your musical talent.\\" The father's wish decided the child's future: her mother encouraged and aided her daughter in every way. Career Abbey Perkins, as a little girl, achieved such successes that, when only fourteen years old, she was called with her mother to take charge of the music in Ingham University, LeRoy, New York. Two years later they resigned that position in order to go abroad for the prosecution of the daughter's musical studies. They went to Germany, where Perkins entered the Conservatory of Leipsic, and also received private tuition from Louis Plaidy. During that year in Leipsic she was a pupil of Oscar Paul, of Theodor Coccius, of Carl Reinecke and others on the piano, and of Ernst Richter in harmony. But the best teachers in Leipsic were unsatisfactory in point of technique, and through the counsel of honest Coccius, as well as by advice of the master, Franz Liszt, she went to Stuttgart to study with Sigismund Lebert, whom Liszt pronounced the greatest living teacher of technique. The school year at Stuttgart had just closed, and Perkins presented herself tremblingly to the master for examination, winning such favor that he offered to teach her, contrary to his custom, through vacation, going three times a week to his pupil's bouse and to the last refusing all compensation. When the school reopened, the young musician was admitted to the artists' class, and there for four years she studied with Lebert and with Priickner, the friend of Von Billow. Then, having received her diploma, she began in Germany her successful career as a musical educator. A term of study with Edward Neupert, the pupil of Theodor Kullak, closed her pupil life, but by no means ended her musical studies. First in Sacramento, California, and later in San Francisco, Cheney was the pioneer of a new school of musical technique, and the signal success achieved by her pupils was proof conclusive that in her treatment of piano-playing, primarily from the physiological standpoint, she enlarged and improved the methods of her masters, Reinecke, Lebert and others. The physiological investigations, which made Cheney an originator in her field of work, were instigated by her own great suffering from partial paralysis of the right hand and arm, brought on by overtaxation when completing her studies abroad. Due to this fact she was a sympathetic broad-minded, self-sacrificing educator instead of a concert pianist. Ellen Browning Scripps was one of her students. Cheney is the author of What It Is That Heals. Personal life In 1876, when Abbey Perkins returned to America from Germany, she was courted by a young musician, poet and litterateur, John Vance Cheney (born December 29, 1848, in Groveland, New York), whom she married and went to live together in California in 1876.

Vanderbilt Handicap, and the Vosburgh Stakes.  Background  Rock Fall is a dark bay horse with no face markings and no leg markings. He was bought for $250,000 at the Fasig Tipton New York Saratoga 2012 Select Yearling Sale. His sire is Speightstown, the winner of the Breeders Cup Sprint. He also is the sire of Breeders Cup Dirt Mile winner Tamarkuz, and Jockey Club Gold Cup winner Haynesfield. Rock Fall's dam, Renda was second in the Forward Gal, and is by Medaglia d'Oro who won the Travers Stakes and sired Hall Of Fame inductee Rachel Alexandra.  Three-Year-Old Season  Rock Fall took a bit longer than other racehorses to begin racing. He did not run until April of his three-year-old season. But he finally made his debut at Gulfstream Park. Unfortunately his introduction to racing was less than stellar, as he broke a step slowly. He then went four wide in a desperate attempt to catch up. However, the move cost him all of his energy causing him to fall back in the pack. In the end, he would cross the finish eighth, 16 lengths behind the winner. It would be the only time Rock Fall ever lost. His next start would be at Belmont Park, and it went a lot better. This time at the start, despite being slightly bumped, he rushed to the front and had the lead by the first quarter of a mile. For the rest of the race all Rock Fall did was widened his lead. At the wire, he had opened up the lead to a very impressive nine and three quarter lengths. Less than a month later, he was back for another race at Belmont Park. He started in fourth again but this time did not hustle immediately to the lead but stayed in third, three lengths behind the leader. By half a mile, Rock Fall, had gotten the lead at the far turn. He remarkably opened up six lengths but he geared down in the final furlong and finished three and a quarter lengths ahead.  Four-year-old season  After three races from April to June as a three-year-old, he planned to train at Saratoga but he suffered multiple minor injuries which forced him to take nine months off. Finally, he returned as a four-year-old in another allowance. To begin the race, he settled off the leaders in seventh before moving up to sixth by the first quarter of a mile. Surprisingly in just a quarter of a mile he moved from sixth to second and was only a head behind the leader. By the far turn he had opened up one and a half lengths before holding on to win by one length at the wire. Just a month later he would be back and running in his last allowance race of his career. He stayed very close behind the leader by just one length. He then took the lead by half a mile in. The rest of the race was just opening up the lead to a whopping nine lengths, defeating New Orleans Handicap winner Nate's Mineshaft. After such domination of allowance races, Rock Fall made his graded stakes debut in the True North Stakes. Due to his overwhelming victory in his last start, he was the 6-5 favorite even though he had never run in a stakes race before. It looked as though he did not disappoint, starting fifth and then quickly moving up to third by the first quarter of a mile. After that, he quickly passed everybody barely having the lead by the far turn. For the rest of the race he opened up his lead and slowly ran away from the competition ‚Äì winning by three and a three quarter lengths and defeating two-time Carter Handicap winner Dads Caps. Next he went up in class again when he ran in the G1 Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap running up against Kings Bishop Stakes winner The Big Beast. At the start, the Big Beast and Favorite Tale fought for the early lead while Rock Fall stayed behind in fourth and then third. By the far turn Favorite Tale had the lead but then began to fade, letting The Big Beast take over the lead. Then out of the blue, Rock Fall took off and got the lead by a nose. Then The Big Beast had the lead. Their two heads were Inseparable and at the wire it was too close to call. After minutes of waiting the race was official. The Big Beast had lost by a nose and Rock Fall would be victorious After little less than two months of rest, he made his second G1 appearance in the Vosburgh Stakes. He also had one more big challenger in Palace, who won the Alfred G Vanderbilt Handicap as well as the Forego Stakes. It was a battle between two G1 winners. However, Rock Fall was much preferred and was bet down to the 2-5 favorite. Rock Fall started out fourth and then third early but he stayed very close to the leaders, only a length behind Wildcat Red and Weekend Hideaway. By the far turn, Rock Fall was only a head behind and was with three other horses running only heads apart. Soon Wildcat Red faded and it became a three- horse race, then a two-horse race. Stallwakin Dude and Rock Fall were head to head then Rock Fall began to slowly inch away until he was half a length in front. Then out the blue, Salutos Amigos flew late and was about to pass Rock Fall, but Rock Fall fought back the late challenge and was the winner by a neck.  Death  After such success the plan was to work out until the Breeders Cup Sprint. His workout went well but right after the workout he broke down and broke both of his front legs.

The project was initiated in November 2014, and was inaugurated the 8 of April 2016. The permanent collection, gathered over the past 25 years by Philippe M√©aille, is not only intended to be exhibited at the Ch√¢teau de Montsoreau, but also to be lent to other institutions. His collection is the world's largest collection of works by the radical conceptualists Art & Language, who have played an important role in the invention of conceptual art. The Philippe M√©aille collection has also been on long-term loan since 2010 at the MACBA of Barcelona, which brings the two institutions to collaborate regularly. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  History  Art & Language, Art-Language Vol. 3 Nr. 1, 1974, Collection Philippe M√©aille. The first long-term loan of the Philippe M√©aille collection with the MACBA is the subject of a retrospective exhibition Art & Language Uncompleted: The Philippe M√©aille Collection in October 2014. A catalog was produced in close collaboration with the artists of Art & Language (Michael Baldwin and Mel Ramsden), as well as academics such as Carles Guerra (chief curator at MACBA) and Matthew Jesse Jackson (Professor in the Department of Visual Arts and Art History at the University of Chicago). Philippe M√©aille, who has lived for 15 years in Anjou, worked in parallel with Christian Gillet, the president of the department of Maine-et-Loire, to study the possibility of creating a museum of contemporary art in Anjou, and to install his collection in the ch√¢teau de Montsoreau, a departmental property. After six months of studies of the alternative offers, a polemic was released by press leaks. Fr√©d√©ric B√©atse, then head of the left wing list in the regional elections, regrets that the right-wing majority of the department of Maine-et-Loire is \\"throwing away the family jewels\\", and that \\"This is all the more shocking as Jacques Auxiette (then president of the Region Pays de la Loire) had proposed to the Department council a partnership between the Abbey of Fontevraud and Montsoreau to make this Saumur area even more attractive.\\" Christian Gillet, president of the department of Maine-et-Loire made his decision on Friday, June 19, 2015 and gave the keys of the Ch√¢teau de Montsoreau to Philippe M√©aille according to an emphyteutic lease of 25 years. At the same time he engaged a reflection on contemporary art as a cultural and touristic priority for the development of Maine-et-Loire.  Restoration works  At the beginning of the 20th century the castle of Montsoreau was almost a ruin. It was saved by an active policy of acquisitions and restoration of the department of Maine-et-Loire under the direction of the b√¢timents de France. Thanks to the last renovations, the historical monument is up to standard and include an elevator. The electricity is now up to standard as well as emergency equipment and fire detection equipment. The lighting benefits from the latest technical developments and has LED (Light Emitting Diode) on all its reception and exhibition spaces. Limewash, which is extremely degraded, has been recovered with traditional lime-blossom. These whitewashes, common in ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley, have the virtue of installing a constant hygrometry. During the redevelopment of a former storage room, the masons discovered a chimney dating from about 1450. This chimney is currently being studied in collaboration with the b√¢timents de France to be restored. These works allow the Ch√¢teau de Montsoreau-mus√©e d'art contemporain to have at present 2,000 square meters of exhibition space. A library on the history of art, contemporary creation and applied arts opened in August 2016. The ch√¢teau de Montsoreau-Museum of contemporary art port reopened at the end of May 2017 after several months of work, to allow its visitors to arrive by boat.  Architecture  Since more than a thousand years, the castle of Montsoreau is the gate of Anjou and now the only Ch√¢teau de la Loire to be a museum of contemporary art. Historically built by one of the ambassadors of Charles VII King of France, Jean II of Chambes is the first of Kingdom's Lords, with Jacques C≈ìur to install the Italian Renaissance in France. He built the Ch√¢teau de Montsoreau between 1443 and 1453, directly by the side of the Loire, like Venetian palaces built during the same period.  Collection  The Philippe M√©aille collection, which constitutes the collection of the museum, is installed on the first two floors of the museum. It is composed exclusively of works by the artists group Art & Language. An agreement with the Tate Modern of London authorizes the screening of a film co-produced by this institution and the Bloomberg foundation to be exhibited inside the Ch√¢teau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art. Founded in 1968, Art & Language ‚Äì which takes its name from the eponymous newspaper Art-Language ‚Äì is made up of British, American and Australian. Their corrosive questions about the status of the artist, the work of art or even the institution itself make them seen as the most radical figures in the history of art of the second half of the twentieth century. This collective, at the origin of what is now called conceptual art is still active and currently represented by Michael Baldwin and Mel Ramsden. Between 1965 and now, up to fifty artists have joined or collaborated with Art & Language, including: Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin, Ian Burn, Charles Harrison, Joseph Kosuth, Sol LeWitt, Philip Pilkington, Mel Ramsden, Dave Rushton, Lynn Lemaster, Mayo Thompson, Kathryn Bigelow, Dan Graham and Lawrence Weiner. In 1977, when Mayo Thompson, leader of the band The Red Krayola left the collective, it was composed of Michael Baldwin, Charles Harrison and Mel Ramsden. The Philippe M√©aille collection is presented in such a multiplicity of media (paintings, sculptures, drawings, manuscripts, tapuscrits, installations and videos) that Carles Guerra will say of it: \\"besides being affected by the artists' attitude, The Philippe M√©aille Collection is further affected by the archaeological perspective with which it was assembled.\\" 800 works from the Philippe M√©aille collection are still on long-term loan at MACBA since 2010. In 2014, MACBA devotes a major retrospective exhibition to Art & Language, under the direction of Carles Guerra: Art & Language uncompleted: The Philippe M√©aille Collection. = Gallery = File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpgArt & Language: Art & Language: Art-Language, Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974.

Passionate about nature, Miriam Rothschild (1908‚Äì2005) devoted all of her life to her scientific research and literally cleared the traditional approach of gardens to create \\"natural\\" gardens. Its Ashton Wold property, located in the north of London, was a real laboratory for conducting environmental experiments and creating these \\"wildgardens\\", nowadays so widespread. Leaving technique, chemistry and interventionism, the wild garden favors the sociability of native plants and preserves the surrounding fauna.

A well-known interpreter of Kant's ethics, Herman works on moral philosophy, the history of ethics, and social and political philosophy. Among her many honors and awards include a Guggenheim Fellowship (1985-1986) and election to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences (1995). Biography Barbara Herman as an undergraduate at Cornell (second row, fourth from the left) sits with fellow Telluride House members including faculty residents Frances Perkins (second row, first from the left) and Paul Grice (second row, first from the right). Herman was born in New York City to Ruth and Robert Herman. Her mother was a secretary and father a union organizer and professional fund-raiser. Her brother is physicist Jay Herman. Herman attended Flushing High School in Queens until 1962, after which she studied history at Cornell University. While a senior at Cornell, Herman was \\"the first woman to live at Telluride House under the new arrangements\\" after \\"Convention for the first time was able to grant full residential preferment to an undergraduate woman.\\" There she lived alongside fellow house members Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Clare Selgin Wolfowitz, and Paul Wolfowitz, as well as in-house faculty members that included the 4th United States Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins and the British philosopher Paul Grice. She has since taught Telluride Association Summer Program (TASP) seminars at Deep Springs College and the Cornell branch. Shortly after graduating from Cornell with a B.A. in 1966, Herman began doctoral studies in the history program at Harvard University. Soon, however, she discovered her affinity for philosophy and transferred to the Philosophy Department, but not before taking an M.A. in Modern European History. Studying under Stanley Cavell and John Rawls, Herman wrote a dissertation entitled \\"Morality as Rationality: A Study of Kant's Ethics\\" in 1976.Harvard University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 1976. 0322393. Of Herman's time at Harvard, Martha Nussbaum said during her introduction to the Dewey Lecture at the University of Chicago Law School: > On a personal note I remember feeling the power of that captivating presence > on the memorable occasion when I first heard Barbara Herman speak. She > probably doesn't remember this at all, but she was an older graduate student > at Harvard and she was famous among us younger graduate students as one of > the best, but I had never really met her or heard her even talk. And on this > occasion she was addressing the whole faculty of the Harvard philosophy > department about why the graduate students wanted to form a union. And I > remember‚Äîand this is a pretty daunting occasion with Van Quine, Nelson > Goodman and all these people sitting there who were actually not very > friendly to the idea of a graduate student union‚Äîbut I remember the > confidence, incisiveness, and great humor with which she faced down that > group, and I remember thinking: this is a truly wise person as well as one > who is a lot of fun. From 1973-1980 Herman was assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, before joining the faculty at the University of Southern California, first as a Visiting Assistant Professor and subsequently as an Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and finally Professor of Philosophy and Law in 1992. In 1994 Herman was appointed Griffin Professor of Philosophy at UCLA and in 2006 was jointly appointed to the law school. Work Barbara Herman lecturing at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics In a review of The Practice of Moral Judgment, Kant scholar Paul Guyer writes of Herman's work: > Herman succeeds in presenting an interpretation of Kant's ethics that shows > it to be a powerful alternative to the empiricist utilitarian, neo- > Aristotelian virtue ethics, and the post-modernist individualist or > existentialist ethical theories which have enjoyed such prominence in recent > years ... What [Herman] has given us is a deeply compelling picture of both > the structure and power of Kant's regulative ideal of moral deliberation, > and that is much to be grateful for indeed. And on her collection of essays entitled Moral Literacy, philosopher Stephen Darwall writes: > Rawls pointed out that it was one of Hegel's aims to overcome the many > dualisms that he thought disfigured Kant's transcendental idealism. Herman's > essays, in my view, are distinctive for this same emphasis. Throughout, she > stresses continuities where more orthodox Kantian thought insists on > separation. And she argues that Kant's central insights are not only > preserved, but improved, when one appreciates these continuities. Thus, > where orthodox Kantian thought sharply distinguishes desire from reason, > love from reason, particular judgment from principle, and so on, Herman > argues that these pairs should all be seen as continuous and interconnected > and that a Kantian take on ethics is enhanced by so viewing them. She is > tough-minded and rigorous, philosophically. And she doesn't waste words. > Herman has an economy of expression and a penchant for illuminating > philosophical coinage. To which legal theorist Lawrence Solum adds on his blog: > In my opinion, Herman's recent work represents the very best of contemporary > moral philosophy in the tradition of Kant--only a handful of scholars > combine her deep appreciation of Kant, philosophical rigor, and genuine > intellectual flexibility. A superb book.

In 1904, she signed a petition for women to be admitted as a Fellow of the Chemical Society.  Life  Dorothy Marshall was born on 12 December 1868 in London. She was one of the three daughters of Julian Marshall, connoisseur and collector, and Florence Ashton Thomas, musician and author . When Marshall was five years old, her father died at age 67. In 1922, her mother died.  Education and Work  Marshall was educated at King Edward VI High School for Girls, Birmingham (KEVI) and went to Bedford College in 1886. Two years later, Marshall went on to study chemistry, physics and electrical technology at University College and graduated with a BSc (third class honours, chemistry) in 1891. As a postgraduate student at University College until 1894, Marshall studied heats of vaporisation of liquids . One of her three lengthy publications was co-authored with William Ramsay and the other one with Ernest Howard Griffiths, both appeared in 1896 and 1897. In 1896, Marshall was appointed as Demonstrator at Girton College, Cambridge and promoted to Resident Lecturer in Chemistry a year later. Marshall left Girton in 1906 to become a Senior Science Lecturer position at Avery Hill College. Appointed as Acting Principal in 1907, she resigned due to \\"illness\\" to refuse the position. In 1908, she became the Senior Science Mistress of Huddersfield Municipal High School. In 1913 she moved south to Clapham High School to take a position as Chemistry Mistress. Like many other women in chemistry, Marshall started war work in 1916, in aeronautical engineering. This work was more in the realm of applied physics or engineering than pure chemistry, as it was looking at the heat flows of aero-engines. She co-authored two reports in 1916‚Äì17 with TE Stanton, one on the effect of surface roughness on the heat transmitted from hot bodies to fluids flowing over them, and the other on effect of surface roughness on the heat transmitted from hot surfaces to fluids flowing over them, with special reference to the case of the gills of an air-cooled engine.Technical Report of the Advisory Committee For Aeronautics for the Year 1916‚Äì17, ACAAR1916-17, downloaded from 13 January 2019. She was thereby one of the first women to be working on the properties of aero-engines, although a number of women were taken on at the end of the war, such as Frances B. Bradfield. She worked with the National Physical Laboratory as scientific research assistant until the end of her career. Awards As an excellent student, Marshall won several awards. She took three silver medals in analytical, organic, and general chemistry in 1888‚Äì1889. The following year, she won a prize in philosophy and logic. In 1889, she held a Tuffnell Scholarship. Works In her papers on the heats of vaporisation of liquids, Marshall introduced a method of comparing directly the heats of evaporation of different liquids at their boiling points. The method used would conduct results that were not affected by errors in thermometer, changes in the specific heat of water, the capacity for heat of the calorimeter, and the loss or gain of heat by radiation. For setting up the apparatus, she wrote, \\"The liquid to be evaporated was contained in a small silver flask, connected with which was a spiral coil of silver tubing 18 feet in length. Both flask and spiral were within the calorimeter, and the water- vapour, after passing through the spiral, emerged from the apparatus at the temperature of the calorimeter. Surrounding the flask, and between it and the spiral, a coil of platinum-silver wire was arranged and flask, spiral, and coil were entirely immersed in a certain singularly limpid oil consisting of hydrocarbons only. \\"The calorimeter (which was filled to the roof with the oil, and the equality of temperature maintained by rapid stirring) was suspended by glass tubes within a steel chamber, whose walls were maintained at a constant temperature. So long, therefore, as the calorimeter and the surrounding walls were at equal temperatures, there was no loss or gain by radiation. If during an experiment the temperature of the surrounding walls changed, the method of experiment involved a corresponding change in the temperature of the calorimeter, and, therefore, some loss or gain of heat would be experienced. The apparatus was so designed that any such change in temperature was extremely small (in no case amounting to rhy¬∞), yet, to estimate the loss or gain, it was necessary to know approximately the capacity for heat of the calorimeter and contents. Small differences between the temperature of the calorimeter and the surrounding walls would, during an experiment, be of no consequence provided that the oscillations were of such a nature that the mean temperature of the calorimeter was that of the surrounding space, and it will be found that this condition was fulfilled.\\" By using equation L=[M/(m.e)].[(V.10^8)/J] where L= heat in calories M = mass of liquid vaporised m = mass of copper deposited e= electrochemical equivalent of copper V = declustering potential in volts J = mechanical equivalent of heat Marshall calculated that the value of L for benzene is 94.4 cal = Publications = Although her early work was largely on the applied physics of heat and its effects, she later also published, as lead author or co-author, on other aspects of flow, such as boundary layer effects and eddies, which had great relevance to the streamlining of aircraft, some of which were widely cited by others.

South Wales Formation sign of 9 AA Division The regiment was formed in South Wales at the height of The Blitz in January and February 1941. Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) was formed at Lawrenny Castle, in Pembrokeshire, on 23 January 1941, and three newly-raised batteries joined on 8 February:Frederick, pp. 758, 783.Farndale, Annex M.Sainsbury, pp. 330‚Äì1. * 381 HAA Bty, formed on 14 November 1940 at 205th HAA Training Regiment at Arborfield from a cadre provided by 56th (Cornwall) HAA Regiment * 384 HAA Bty, formed on 14 November 1940 at 206th HAA Training Regiment at Arborfield from a cadre provided by 87th HAA Regiment (a unit from County Durham) * 386 HAA Bty, formed on 14 November 1940 at 207th HAA Training Regiment at Devizes from a cadre provided by 76th (Gloucestershire) HAA Regiment The regiment came under the command of 61 AA Brigade in 9 AA Division,Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79. and at the beginning of March 384 HAA Bty relieved 174 HAA Bty of 85th (Tees) HAA Rgt at gunsites O1 (defending Royal Ordnance Factory Pembrey) and P6 (West Pennar defending the oil terminal at Pembroke Dock). These were equipped with four 3-inch and four 3.7-inch guns respectively and were under the operational command of 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) HAA Rgt.Sainsbury, pp. 73‚Äì6, 80, 84. However, the batteries were soon moved eastwards to bolster the Gun Defence Area (GDA) around Swansea, which had been badly hit by Luftwaffe raids on three successive nights in February (the Swansea Blitz). Half of 384 HAA Bty took over site O2 at Llanelli with four 3-inch guns on 19 March, and on 24 March the detachments at Pembrey were ordered to take their guns and set up a new temporary site designated N12, approximately one mile west of Jersey Marine. Next the detachments at Llanelli moved their guns to N9, north-east of Port Talbot and reported ready for action on 5 April. On 18 April 386 HAA Bty also came under the operational command of 79th (HY) HAA Rgt. By the end of April, 120th HAA Rgt was responsible for the following positions under 79th (HY) HAA Rgt in the Swansea GDA:Sainsbury, pp. 85‚Äì6. * N3A, Jersey Marine ‚Äì 2 Sections 386 HAA Bty (4 x 3-inch) * N7, Briton Ferry ‚Äì 384 HAA Bty (2 x 3.7-inch, 2 x 3-inch) * N9, Port Talbot ‚Äì 384 HAA Bty (4 x 3-inch) By now, the Blitz was nearing its end. All the enemy activity in April consisted of raids passing over South Wales on their way to attack targets elsewhere, with the guns being engaged on the nights of 3/4, 7/8 and 15/16 April, the latter night being a long engagement giving the gunners good practice in firing at 'unseen' targets under control of GL Mk. I radar while the bombers crossed the area northwards and then returned southwards. Engagements the following month were also sporadic, with the guns firing on 4/5, 7/8 and 11/12 May (regarded as the last night of the Blitz).Sainsbury, p. 87. Between June and August the batteries handed over their responsibilities to 79th (HY) HAA Rgt and returned to the command of 120th HAA Rgt, which was ordered to leave South Wales and join 26 (London) AA Bde in 1 AA Division defending London. On 21 August the regiment was joined by the experienced 248 (Welwyn) HAA Bty transferred from 79th (HY) HAA Rgt. The Welwyn Battery was a prewar Territorial Army unit that had seen heavy action during the Battle of France in 1940 and the Swansea Blitz in February 1941.Sainsbury, pp. 28‚Äì87.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80. London Formation sign of 1 AA Division In London the regiment and its four batteries (248, 381, 384, 386) took over gunsites in the northern part of the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ). For example, on 21 August 248 (Welwyn) HAA Bty took over two static four-gun 3.7-inch sites: * ZW2 ‚Äì Edmonton * ZE10 ‚Äì Highams 3.7-inch gun at preserved gunsite at Mudchute on the Isle of Dogs, Routine moves over the following months saw 248 Bty occupying the following sites at various times: * ZW5 ‚Äì Hyde Park * ZW8 ‚Äì Hurlingham * ZE22 ‚Äì Hampstead * ZE5 ‚Äì Clayhall * ZW13 ‚Äì Mill Hill * ZE21 ‚Äì Hackney (4 x 4.5-inch guns) * ZE8 ‚Äì Isle of Dogs (4 x 4.5-inch) 4.5-inch gunsite of the type manned by 120th HAA Rgt. 120th HAA Regiment remained in and around London for over a year, serving through the desultory Luftwaffe raids of 1942.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82. In October 1942, 386 HAA Bty left the regiment and joined a new 175th HAA Rgt that was being formed. 386 HAA Battery later served with 175th HAA Rgt in defence of Gibraltar.Routledge, p. 204, Table XXXIV, p. 212. Then in mid- January 1943, 120th HAA Rgt moved out of 26 AA Bde's area and came under direct War Office control to mobilise for overseas service as a defended ports unit on a three-battery establishment (248, 381, 384 Btys). Cyprus After two months at the mobilisation centre at Easthampstead in Berkshire the regiment sailed from Liverpool on 14 March and disembarked at Port Tewfik in Egypt on 6 May. Here it came under the command of Middle East Forces.Joslen, p. 484. After a month in Egypt it was moved by railway to Beirut and then by sea to Cyprus, where it landed on 14 June to take over AA defence of ports and airfields on the island under 20 AA Bde in Ninth Army.Joslen, p. 487.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, TNA file WO 212/9 and WO 33/1987. 248 (Welwyn) Battery was initially deployed as follows: * A Troop: Larnaca (4 x mobile 3.7-inch) * B Troop: Nicosia (4 x mobile 3.7-inch) At the end of June 1943 the regiment was changed to a semi-mobile establishment. In early July, A Trp of 248 Bty moved to Famagusta and then to Limassol in mid-August, while B Trp moved to Paphos in mid-August. In addition, detachments from 248 battery manned guns on the island of Castelrosso, at that time the only island of the Dodecanese in Allied hands. At the end of October 1943, the regiment was 'diluted' (as the process was officially described) by a draft of Basuto troops from the African Pioneer Corps to be trained as gunners, releasing a similar number of British Other Ranks for duties elsewhere.Jackson, pp. 260‚Äì4. The state of readiness in Cyprus was relaxed in March 1944 and the AA defences on the island were run down during April. The remaining personnel moved to Cairo where 120th HAA Rgt was disbanded on 25 June 1944.

She was requisitioned by the Admiralty to serve as a minesweeper during World War I and again in World War II, and was sunk while participating in the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. The current PS Waverley, launched in 1946, was built as a replacement for this vessel.  History  Waverley was built by A. & J. Inglis for the North British Steam Packet Co. at their Pointhouse shipyard on the Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland. The ship was designed to be the flagship of the North British Steam Packet Co. fleet with the intention that it could be used for regular Clyde services but also to help the company expand their initial foray into excursions in areas around Bute, Arran, Kintyre and Loch Fyne. She was launched on 29 May 1899 and entered service on 10 July 1899. In 1902, North British Steam Packet Co was dissolved and Waverley was transferred to the ownership of its parent company North British Railway operating a smaller range of routes that didn't include Kintyre, Loch Fyne and the west of Arran. = World War I = Like many Clyde steamers, Waverley was requisitioned in 1915 by the Admiralty for service during World War I, being modified to increase her decked area and adding bow plating. For four years she served on the British and Belgian coasts, and was discharged from service in April 1919. = Return to service = She spent over a year being renovated for her return to service, with the most obvious change being the repositioning of her bridge from its original location between her paddle boxes to a new location in front of her funnel. She was returned to her owners on 9 July 1920. As the Railways Act 1921 took effect in 1923, Waverley was transferred again as North British Railway was merged into London and North Eastern Railway. In 1931 the Waverley was superseded as the fleet's flagship by the newly launched PS Jeanie Deans, but was renovated in 1923 with the addition of shelters on the promenade deck and remodelled interior passengers spaces to bring her up to the same standard as more modern steamers like the Jeanie Deans. By the late 1930s decreasing passenger numbers on the Clyde estuary resulted in other steamers being moved to service routes elsewhere, and the Waverley was removed from service in 1939. = World War II = With the outbreak of World War II she was brought briefly back into service to evacuate children from Glasgow to areas on the Clyde coast, and was then requisitioned by the Royal Navy to serve as the lead ship of the 12th Minesweeping Flotilla. The flotilla consisted of five paddle steamers, was based at Harwich on the east coast of England, and tasked with sweeping the shipping lanes. On 28 May 1940, this flotilla was given orders to stock up and sail south to take part in Operation Dynamo, the effort to evacuate Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. The next day the ship was intercepted by 12 German Heinkels while returning to England with 600 troops on board. After avoiding their bombs for about 30 minutes, one struck the port side of the ship and opened a 6-foot hole in the bottom of the ship. The ship sank near Kwint Bank Buoy with the loss of some crew and about 400 troops. 158 survivors were pulled from the water by the Cyclone, 285 by the PS Golden Eagle. A Dutch tugboat Java and two drifters picked up a few more.

P. Dutton. Contents Muto, a graduate of University of Notre Dame, started work at Fox as a production assistant and became an associate producer for Bill O'Reilly's show. He was fired due to leaking information to Gawker. Gawker paid him $5,000 for the material. Muto pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges: attempted computer tampering and attempted theft. He was sentenced to over 200 hours of community service and a fine of $1,000; he also gave up all of the funds Gawker paid him to the court. The book switches back and forth between his firing and the chronology of his time at Fox. Calvin Terbeek of the Houston Press wrote that the initial parts of the book largely discusses the general management style of cable news, and that the Fox- specific content largely appears after Muto is brought on to Bill O'Reilly's program; according to Terbeek, the book focuses more on O'Reilly than on Sean Hannity. The Associated Press stated that \\"His book isn't a diatribe, and is often funny. He knows there are stories some of his former colleagues won't like, but Muto is hard on himself, too.\\" According to the AP, it has \\"a detailed character study of O'Reilly\\". Eric Deggans of the Tampa Bay Times stated that \\"media nerds\\" would find interest in the content about O'Reilly. Reception Andrew Mueller of the New Humanist wrote that Muto is \\"a breezy, amiable storyteller who manages to turn a yarn that could easily have been a magazine article into an altogether readable book that rarely feels padded.\\" Nicky Woolf of the New Statesman argued that the book has few new revelations about Fox News figures, and that it was \\"insightful, if a little underwhelming.\\" Deggans wrote that \\"I found the middle sections a compelling, detailed look at how cable's top anchor chooses stories and develops his onscreen image.\\" Terbeek describes the book as \\"a liberal's beach book read: light, easy and mostly fun.\\" He criticizes the author's attempts at humor within the book's first 75 pages. He argued that political conservatives may enjoy reading the book for gossip presented on Fox News personalities and on the information on how cable news networks are operated.

She mainly painted landscapes from Norrland, Sk√•ne, V√§stmanland and around Stockholm, made in oil or in tempera.  Biography  Anna Cassel was the daughter of the company manager Per August Cassel and Josefina Ramberg. She belonged to a wealthy family. She lived with her mother and three of her four sisters, Lotten, Emma and Elin at Engelbrektsgatan 31 in Stockholm. Anna Cassel was described by her brother-in- law Karl √ñhman, who in an unpublished book describes their relation from the common standpoint in their interest for painting : \\"Anna Cassel gave me another direction. Not through any moral nor philosophical discussion, but through her moral artistic personality. Her strong personality had a strong impact on me, and art the moderating context.\\" Anna Cassel was a lifelong friend of the artist Hilma af Klint. The two first met in 1878 when Cassel started studying at Sl√∂jdskolan, the year before it changed name to Tekniska skolan (now called Konstfack). They pursued their studies at Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm. The two women shared a strong interest in the spiritual movement. Anna Cassel was a member of the Edelweiss Society at the same time as Hilma af Klint. In 1904, she became member of the Theosophical Lodge of Stockholm, where her sister Lotten Cassel had been a member since 1895.  De Fem  In 1896 Anna Cassel and Hilma af Klint founded the group De Fem (The Five). Sigrid Hedman, Mathilda Nilsson and Cornelia Cederberg (sister of Mathilda Nilsson) were the other members of the group. They began as an ordinary spiritualist group and their paintings took spiritual and ritual themes. The artists in their seances were said to have communicated with spirits through a psychograph, an instrument for recording spirit writings, or a trance medium. During these events, spirit leaders presented themselves by name and promised to help the group‚Äôs members in their spiritual training. The spirits communicating with the five women were mostly Gregor, Georg, Clemens, Ananda och Amaliel. Such leaders are common in spiritualist literature and life. Through their spiritual guidance, the group was inspired to draw automatically in pencil, a technique that was not unusual at that time. When the hand moved automatically, the conscious will did not direct the pattern that developed on the paper, and, in theory, the women thus became artistic tools for their spirit leaders. This technique, called automatism was used a decade later by the Surrealists. In a series of sketchbooks, religious scenes and symbols were depicted in drawings made by the group collectively. Their drawing technique developed in such a way that abstract patterns‚Äîdependent on the free movement of the hand‚Äîbecame visible.\\"Revolt, They Said\\". www.andreageyer.info. Retrieved 2017-08-13. The group De Fem ceased to meet in 1907. Several of its members went over to collaborate with Hilma af Klint for the Paintings for the Temple. In the new group, Anna Cassel would play a key role, besides Hilma af Klint. Anna Cassel also came to assist Hilma af Klint financially through most part of her life. Among others, she financed the new studio built on the island Muns√∂ not far from Stockholm, which was inaugurated in 1917. This is where Hilma af Klint's paintings were stored when she died.

Vecindario is the nerve centre of the south-eastern conurbation of Gran Canaria, consisting mainly of the coastal neighbourhoods of the municipalities of Santa Luc√≠a de Tirajana, Ag√ºimes and Ingenio, which are all on the island of Gran Canaria. Other towns in this conurbation, which has around 120,000 inhabitants, are Cruce de Arinaga, Playa de Arinaga (Ag√ºimes) and Carrizal (Ingenio). Agriculture was the main economic activity of Vecindario until the last quarter of the twentieth century for the production of tomatoes and other vegetables for export, when the service sector (especially trade) became predominant. At present, Vecindario is the largest urban open-air shopping centre on the island of Gran Canaria, together with the C.C. Atl√°ntico and others of lesser importance such as C.C. Mercacentro, C.C. La Ciel and C.C. Avenida.  History  Vecindario was born as a result of the Ag√ºimes mutiny, a consequence of the lawsuit between the residents of Ag√ºimes and the Count of the Vega Grande over the ownership of the lands of the Llanos that they had plundered clandestinely. The Count claimed his property, alleging that he had bought it from its rightful owner. The neighbors of Ag√ºimes, which belonged at that time to the Bishopric, were defended by Dr. Mendoza, a canon expert in law. It is precisely in this lawsuit that the name Vecindario (\\"the neighborhood's land\\") is used for the first time, in reference to the neighbors of Ag√ºimes. Dr. Mendoza demonstrated the falsity of the sale to the Count of the lands, which were of real ownership and had been granted to the neighbors in property by the payment of the pertinent taxes. Still in 1735, the neighbors had not paid Doctoral Mendoza for his defense in the lawsuit, so they proceeded to segregate a part of the lands of Vecindario as payment: it is in this area, later known as El Doctoral, where the house of La Pinta was built. Mendoza stipulated that a part of what was produced on a plot of land segregated for this purpose would be destined to the aid of the Holy House of Jerusalem, taking this place from then on the name of the Holy House. In 1815 the coastal area (today's Vecindario and Sardina, until then part of Ag√ºimes) and inland lands belonging to San Bartolom√© de Tirajana were united to create the new municipality of Santa Luc√≠a de Tirajana.thumbleft311x311px Vecindario panorama See also *List of municipalities in Las Palmas  References  External links * Vecindario website Category:Populated places in Gran Canaria ","title":"Vecindario"},{"id":"54879635","text":"Cornelia Carolina Amalia Cederberg, born on November 6 1854 in Stockholm, died February 21 1933 in Stockholm,Sveriges d√∂dbok 1901‚Äì2013 was one of the members of the group De Fem (The Five), a spiritualistic group founded in 1896, and dissolved in 1907. The other members the group De Fem (The Five) were Hilma af Klint, Anna Cassel, Sigrid Hedman and Mathilda Nilsson (Cornelia Cederberg's sister). It began as an ordinary spiritualist group that received messages through a psychograph (an instrument for recording spirit writings) or a trance medium. During group's s√©ances spirit leaders presented themselves by name and promised to help the group's members in their spiritual training. The spirits communicating with the five women were mostly Gregor, Georg, Clemens, Ananda och Amaliel. Such leaders are common in spiritualist literature and life. Through their spiritual guidance, the group was inspired to draw automatically in pencil, a technique that was not unusual at that time. When the hand moved automatically, the conscious will did not direct the pattern that developed on the paper, and, in theory, the women thus became artistic tools for their spirit leaders. This technique, called automatism was used a decade later by the Surrealists. In a series of sketchbooks, religious scenes and symbols were depicted in drawings made by the group collectively. Their drawing technique developed in such a way that abstract patterns‚Äîdependent on the free movement of the hand‚Äîbecame visible.\\"Revolt, They Said\\". www.andreageyer.info. Retrieved 2017-08-13. The group De Fem ceased to meet in 1907. Several of its members went over to collaborate with Hilma af Klint for the Paintings for the Temple.

According to Muto, he wanted to quit Fox News and work for Gawker, but Gawker staff instead proposed that he remain at Fox and leak material to them. To prove he worked at Fox News, Muto sent Gawker two Fox News outtakes: one was a discussion of horses by Sean Hannity and Mitt Romney, and another was Newt Gingrich having his hair done by his wife. Gawker paid him $5,000 for the material. The outtakes were posted publicly. According to Muto, he believed that only certain people in the New York City media industry would be interested in his column, but media attention spread nationally and to major news outlets. Fox News staff looked at the login information and found that Muto was the only person to recently access both videos. The company fired him. Misdemeanor conviction and aftermath On May 9, Muto pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges: \\"attempted unlawful duplication of computer material\\" and \\"attempted criminal possession of computer material\\". He was sentenced to 200 hours of private community service, ten days of community service ordered by the court, and a fine of $1,000; he also gave up the $5,000 Gawker paid him to the court. Gawker paid for Muto's criminal defense. As part of his community service Muto cleaned municipal parks, and for his private community service he chose to assist a Brooklyn literacy organization.

In 1986 the Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa made an official visit to the temple to pay homage to the sacred tooth relic. During this visit the chief monks complained about water leaking from the roof and Premadasa pledged to cover the roof with a bronze sheet. Six months later, Premadasa formally announced plans to build a golden canopy over the inner shrine room of the temple. There were a number of objectors to the proposal including the Director of the Sri Lankan Department of Archeology, Roland Silva, arguing that a canopy over the existing roof would risk the structural integrity of the building and the temple's heritage value, given that there had been no additions made to the building since the last King of Kandy, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, had occupied the throne. On 31 December 1987 the golden canopy, which cost more than Rs 20M, was officially unveiled by Premadasa. The gold plated tiles on the canopy were imported from Japan and installed upon a steel frame. As the use of concrete was not practical due to the limited timeframe for construction a steel frame was erected however this resulted in the canopy being subject to swaying so further steel supports were installed, projecting from the upper level of the Dalada Museum, directly behind the Palle Mahala (Tevava Chamber). Political commentators at the time attribute Premadasa's decision to erected the golden canopy as being a significant factor in his subsequent election to the country's presidency in January 1988.

The existing building was mainly constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries and was sensitively restored in 1908‚Äì1909. The church is most famous for its rood screen which dates from 1500. It is a Grade I listed building. History Issui was an early Welsh saint who lived by the well next to the site of the church. Following his murder, the well became a place of pilgrimage and the church was founded with the offerings of pilgrims in 1060. Gerald of Wales is reputed to have preached at the church in 1188 while on his tour of Wales. The church was undamaged during the Reformation, the dual altars being spared by the order of Edward VI in 1550. The church similarly escaped any large-scale Victorian reconstruction and was carefully restored by W. D. Car√∂e in 1908‚Äì1909. The church remains an active church in the parish of the Vale of Gwrynne. Architecture and description The rood loft The church comprises a nave, chancel and porch with a separate shrine-chapel to the West. The walls are of rubble and the roofs of slate. The style throughout is Gothic. The wall to the right of the porch has a rare stone bench facing the preaching cross in the churchyard. The bellcote holds two bells and is a stone replacement by Car√∂e for the timber original. The nave has a roof of the 16th century. It is windowless to the North, with windows of a Tudor date inserted in the South wall. The wagon roof of the chancel is a replacement by Car√∂e. The rood screen is the highlight of the interior. In the Powys volume of The Buildings of Wales series, the architectural historians Richard Scourfield and Robert Haslam record a description of it as, \\"the most perfect and elegant now standing in the kingdom\\". It dates from 1500 and was sensitively restored by Car√∂e. It stretches the entire nave, and has a frieze of dragons or wyverns expectorating vines. The writer Simon Jenkins describes it as \\"exquisitely wrought\\". In addition to the rood screen, the church has a significant collection of wall paintings. They comprise four groups: a Stuart Coat of Arms which the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales considers are those of James I; two groups of Biblical texts, including the Lord's Prayer, the Decalogue and the Apostles' Creed; and a \\"Doom Figure\\" of Death as a skeleton with an hourglass in his left hand and a knife in his right, which dates from the 17th century. The church is a Grade I listed building. A number of structures in the vicinity of the church have their own Grade II listings including St Issui's Well, the churchyard cross, the former stable, and the lych gate.

Economic anxiety can increase due to loss of household income or decreased purchasing power, causing affected individuals to self-report having more issues with societal structure and a lower quality of life. Events in the life of an individual such as unemployment, divorce, or a serious illness can also trigger decreased income, and by result, economic anxiety. Research has shown that high levels of economic insecurity exist among low-income households, and that economic anxiety has a positive correlation with growing economic inequality in the United States.  Social and physical effects of economic anxiety  There are a myriad of adverse physical and social conditions that research correlates with individuals who feel economic anxiety. Higher levels of economic anxiety have been shown to be positively correlated with a fear of crime. When faced with economic anxiety, individuals are more likely to smoke cigarettes as a \\"self-medicating\\" coping mechanism. Studies have shown even a 1 percent increase in the chances of becoming unemployed make an individual 2.4 percent more likely to start or continue smoking. Researchers have also found that economic anxiety causes people to gain weight, and that economic anxiety self- reinforces obesity. In one study, a .01 percent increase in chances of becoming unemployed caused average weight gain over a 12-year period to increase by about 0.6 pounds. Each 50% decrease in annual income caused average weight gain for that 12-year period to increase by an extra 5 pounds. Studies have also found that economic insecurity causes physical pain and reduces pain tolerance levels. When individuals lose their jobs, contemplate unemployment levels in their home state or neighborhood, or even when they contemplate past or future economic insecurity, pain levels rise. This suggests that just the prospect, or idea, of economic loss can also be harmful to health.  Measuring economic anxiety  To measure economic anxiety, surveys measure not only financial anxiety (which relates to a person's anxiety about finances on a personal, individual level) but also individuals' feelings surrounding the nation's economy. The Marketplace-Edison Research Poll surveys the economic anxiety of Americans regularly. How an individual answers the questions in the Marketplace-Edison Research Poll determines their Economic Anxiety Index, which is a number ranging from 1-100 designed to represent a person's stress related to the economy. The research poll and Index center on 12 questions regarding job security, savings and expenses, and general financial anxiety. The higher a person scores on the Economic Anxiety Index, the more concerned they are said to be about the state of their personal finances and the national economy. Surveys of Americans using the Economic Anxiety Index over time have shown there are strong divisions in economic anxiety between pay grades. Hourly workers have far more economic anxiety than salaried workers, and renters tend to be more stressed financially than those with home mortgages.  Examples of economic anxiety in recent years  The role of economic anxiety among working-class whites was a hot topic following Trump's presidential election in 2016. According to the News on the Web database, use of the term ‚Äúeconomic anxiety‚Äù peaked on American news platforms in November 2016. Economic anxiety has been widely cited (e.g. by commentators at FiveThirtyEight) as a major reason for Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Other commentators, however, argued that economic anxiety was less of an important factor in predicting support for Trump than \\"cultural anxiety,\\" or the feeling that one is a stranger in America and that illegal immigrants should be deported. In addition, there was a positive correlation between income and support for Trump in 2016; Hillary Clinton won among those with incomes under $50,000, while Trump won among those with incomes above $50,000, according to exit polls. The term has also been used sarcastically in response to racist statements and actions by Trump's supporters, to mock the attempts by certain political commentators to argue that support for Trump is due to concern about their economic prospects, not to racist attitudes. Some fear now that economic anxiety spurred on by the COVID-19 pandemic will cause a long-term economic downturn worldwide. In May of 2020, the Marketplace-Edison Research Poll found that 44% of Americans were concerned about whether they could afford groceries, and that economic anxiety had increased in all demographics since 2019, save those who made less than $25,000 per year in 2020 and the previous year.

(also known as Clearpath) was founded in 2009 by a group of four University of Waterloo graduates, and remains headquartered in Waterloo Region, Canada. The original goal of Clearpath was to streamline field robotics research for universities and private corporations, but the company has since expanded and is now also manufacturing and selling the OTTO line of self-driving vehicles for industrial environments.  History  Clearpath Robotics was founded in 2009 based on a growing demand for environmental monitoring and robotics research equipment. Unlike other robotics startups, they only raised a small amount of angel investment upon founding, and sought to achieve profitability before raising more. In 2012, the Open Source Robotics Foundation was established to ensure that there was continuity in the work being done with ROS, with Clearpath CTO Ryan Gariepy joining the founding board. Not too long after, original ROS creator Willow Garage announced a reduction in formal support. Due to concerns raised by the academic community regarding the future of robotics research, Clearpath issued a statement to reinforce that it would continue to do what it could to support ROS. With the complete shutdown of Willow Garage in early 2014, Clearpath took over complete maintenance and support of the PR2 robot until through at least 2016. In August 2014, Clearpath became the first robotics company in the world to pledge not to make 'killer robots' (Lethal autonomous weapons), and continues to back initiatives to ensure AI and autonomous systems are developed in an ethical fashion. By March 2015, Clearpath announced a $14 million Series A investment led by RRE Ventures meant to fund the development of products capable of automating dangerous jobs in industrial and manufacturing facilities. Shortly thereafter, they announced the first of their OTTO line of vehicles with General Electric as a first customer and strategic investor, as well as announced that Tesla, Inc. co-founder Marc Tarpenning had joined their advisory board. At the same time, it continued to develop and sell systems meant to fulfill its original mandate of helping researchers work more efficiently. A Series B funding round was announced in October 2016 led by iNovia Capital, which also added Caterpillar Inc. as another strategic investor. Clearpath is currently one of the most well-known Canadian robotics startups, and is regularly recognized as one of the \\"Top 50 Most Influential Companies in Robotics\\" by Robotics Business Review.  Divisions  = Clearpath Robotics = The original Clearpath Robotics brand encompasses the manufacture and sale of a variety of land and sea vehicles used for robotics research, as well as the sale of individual components for robotics prototyping through its online store. It also provides custom robotics integration as well as ROS consulting services, with a portion of the revenue of the latter going to support the Open Source Robotics Foundation. Clearpath was one of the original manufacturers and distributors of the TurtleBot series of open-source research robots, and still continues to manufacture and sell them. = OTTO Motors = The complete OTTO Motors brand was announced in 2016, and is Clearpath's first known entry into the large scale deployment of autonomous vehicles. Its first customer was General Electric, and other notable clients include John Deere and Toyota.  Litigation  In August 2016, Clearpath filed a complaint in the Northern district of California against Otto (company) with respect to Clearpath Robotics Inc.'s OTTO brand. The action was dismissed with prejudice on February 1, 2017. As of May 2017, Uber has ceased using the OTTO trademark, and Clearpath continues to operate the OTTO brand. In light of Waymo LLC v. Uber Technologies, Inc. et al., Clearpath has issued a statement to clarify brand confusion.

The cemetery is located in the center of Bacau, bordered by Pictor Theodor Aman Street from the north and Ghioceilor street in the east, just a few meters from the Athletics Hall, the Bacovia University and the Zimbru neighborhood. Among others, were also buried here former participants in the Romanian War of Independence of 1877. By 1912 the cemetery became full and the last burial took place in 1917 when the new cemetery was opened. History According to the spokesman of Bacau City Hall \\"the land does not belong to the municipality\\". Other (unofficial) sources from the City Hall even stated that the land does not even belong to the Romanian state. The former president of the jewish community, Hari Vigdar (died 2013), said that \\"we too do not know much about this cemetery. It was closed at the beginning of the twentieth century and is listed in our records as being repaired. We do not have any money to restore, we only have someone to look after and protect the place. We have not heard that a member living in our community has relatives buried there. The monuments are very difficult to read, they have deteriorated, and the writing is in Old Hebrew. Iacob Psantir, researcher of Jewish history in Romania published a book in 1871 in which he described the cemetery: \\"In this cemetery there are many other tomb stones which cannot be read, since for some the letters are erased by time, while others are buried so deep that I could not dig them up to read. However, the one that I did find and could read has marvellous and legible letters, but somehow was never mentioned in any registry‚Äù. The oldest tombstone found in the cemetery belongs to a person called \\"Aaron, the son of Yossef\\". He died in 1703. The researcher I. Kara researched the cemetery in 1936 and 1946 and found the tombstone mentioned by Mr.Psantir. He copied the inscription from the stone and published an essay claiming that this stone dated 1703 couldn't be the oldest one in the city, but does show that beginning of the 18th century there existed a Jewish population of numerical significance. The inscription from this tombstone reads: \\"This important man, honourable Aharon, son of departed Yosef, died on the 29th of Ijar, buried on the 15th Sivan year 5464\\". It is still a mystery why so many days had passed between the death and the burial of Aharon, knowing that in the Jewish tradition it is disrespectful for the dead to wait that long before burying him. After careful consideration, Mr.Kara decided that he had to have died somewhere where there wasn't a Jewish cemetery, and he was buried there temporarily, but later exhumed and transported to Bacau for his final resting-place. After World War II it was transferred to the Jewish History Museum in Romania in Bucharest. Urban legends Until the 70s people were looking for gold, believing that the wealthy jews were buried with everything. Gold has never been found, but children playing around have found swords from the Independence War.

It is native to Antarctica where it grows in dim light on the underside of sea ice. Some of it becomes detached and accumulates in drifts on the seabed. Many different organisms live attached to the fronds or among them. Distribution P. antarctica is native to Antarctica. It is known from the Antarctic Peninsula, McMurdo Sound, the Ross Sea, South Georgia, Victoria Land and various subarctic islands. The type locality is Coulman Island near Cape Wadworth in the Ross Sea. Biology In addition to chlorophyll a, P. antarctica has other biliprotein pigments, namely R-phycoerythrin, phycocyanin and allophycocyanin. These pigments give the seaweed a greater ability to utilise blue light in the dim sub-ice environment. The phycoerythrin absorbs the blue light energy and then transfers it to the other biliproteins from where it is passed on to the photosynthetic reaction centre, where it is turned into chemical energy. Ecology P. antarctica reaches its greatest density in January, the Antarctic midsummer. In some locations such as at Cape Evans on Ross Island, P. antarctica is the main primary producer at depths between . Some of it is attached, but most is drifting and accumulates on the sea bed. At first, the detached fronds are in good condition and photosynthesis continues, but over time they degrade and are gradually broken up. These beds of decaying algae have a substantial effect on the communities living on and under the seabed. Although the alga contains secondary metabolites which make it distasteful to herbivores, research has shown that polychaete worms and amphipods consume it to some extent, and the beds of drifting seaweed may help provide continuity of food supply for them during the dark Antarctic winter. P. antarctica provides a large surface area on which other organisms can grow, and it has a rich and diverse associated fauna. In some circumstances, particularly when the Antarctic sea urchin (Sterechinus neumayeri) is restricting the algal growth, the biomass of the organisms living on the alga may exceed that of the alga itself. The species found attached or associated with the alga include the limpet Iothia emarginuloides, the amphipod Paramoera walkeri, various polychaete worms, and the Antarctic sea urchin. Other epiphytes include bryozoans, serpulid worms and hydroids, the latter being preyed on by the nudibranch Tenellia georgiana.

Originally named Whitehills, it is a Category A listed building which is now occupied and maintained by the National Trust for Scotland. The current building comprises the original 7-bay frontage flanked by later extensions. The stable block is also a Category A building. Newhailes, Dalrymple's and the Scottish Enlightenment The house was originally built c.1686 on the Whitehill estate by Scottish architect James Smith for his own use. While studying to become a priest in Rome as a young man, Smith had been greatly inspired by the work of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio. Instead of becoming a priest, Smith became an architect. Despite being Scotland's ‚Äòmost experienced architect‚Äô of the time, financial difficulties, an unsuccessful coal-mining venture forced Smith to sell the house just a decade or so later to the Bellendens of Broughton. = Sir David Dalrymple, 1st Baronet, of Hailes (1665 ‚Äì 1721) = In 1701 the estate was sold to John Bellenden, 2nd Lord Bellenden, a Scottish nobleman, it became Broughton House. Some years later in financial difficulties he sold it to Sir David Dalrymple, 1st Baronet and his wife, Janet Rochead in May 1709. He renamed the house Newhailes in recognition of Hailes Castle on their family estate at East Linton and added the east wing as a library. This anticipated the beginnings of the Enlightenment culture, based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh and accumulate into The Select Society in the 1750s. Sir David was a Scottish advocate and politician who sat in the Parliament of Scotland from 1698 to 1707 and in the British House of Commons from 1707 to 1721. He served as Lord Advocate, and eventually Auditor of the Exchequer in Scotland in 1720. They were to become a wealthy Edinburgh legal dynasty; it would also become the golden age of artistic and intellectual development in Scotland. Note: His older brother, John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair, became one of the darkest figures in Scottish history when he organised and authorised the 1692 Massacre of Glencoe. = Sir James Dalrymple, 2nd Baronet (1692‚Äì1751) = On his death in 1721 the house passed to his heir Sir James Dalrymple, 2nd Baronet, a Member of Parliament (MP) for Haddington Burghs and the Principal Auditor of the Exchequer in Scotland.the Principal Auditor of the Exchequer in Scotland.Horrocks, Hilary (2017), Newhailes, National Trust for Scotland Sir James extended and reshaped the house, adding a balancing west apartment wing, and moving the entrance from the north-east to the south-west. The gardens were probably laid out at the same time. In the pediment over the front door are the heads of a male and a female in profile with the inscription laudo manentum that is a quote from Horace referring to 'fickle fortune'. Over the north door of the house is inscribed another Horace quote sapienter uti which relates to the happy man who wisely uses whatever he has been given to work with. It is considered by many that the carved heads were inspired by the famous and controversial Edinburgh 'Netherbow Heads' that were at the time considered to be of Roman origin representing the Emperor Septimius Severus and his consort Julia Domna. = Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, 3rd Baronet of Hailes (1726‚Äì1792) = The house passed to Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, 3rd Baronet of Hailes (28 October 1726 ‚Äì 29 November 1792) a Scottish advocate, judge and historian, born in Edinburgh. Lord Hailes continued the Scottish tradition of completing his legal education in The Netherlands, studying in Utrecht before being admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1748, where he demonstrated an interest in books by becoming a curator in 1752.Cadell, p 'He moved normally in the highest ranks of Edinburgh Society' Carnie, unpaginated and appears to us as a textbook character of the Scottish Enlightenment. He attended the theatre and dancing assemblies, the profits of which went to charitable causes, and between 1750 and 1774 took a prominent part in many of Edinburgh's most famous cultural activities. Hailes was highly active in the club life of Edinburgh, being a member of, amongst others, the Select Society. The Society, founded in 1754 by Allan Ramsay, had a membership composed of socially prominent members of the city's elite that reads like a who's who of Edinburgh's Enlightenment. Although set up as a debating club, the importance of maintaining polite society was recognised by the rule that anything could be discussed 'except such as regard Revealed Religion, or which may give occasion to vent any principles of Jacobitism'.Broadie, pp 26-27 Hailes's nature and interest in his fellow man is shown by his involvement in an offshoot of the Select Society, known as the Edinburgh Society, one of the best examples of the improving spirit of the age. Following their return from the Highlands, Samuel Johnson and James Boswell met Lord Hailes at dinner in Edinburgh on 17 August 1773. It would be later declared by Dr Johnson, \\"the most learned drawing-room in Europe\\". Boswell records that Lord Hailes 'pleased him [i.e. Johnson] highly'.Boswell p 28-9 We know Johnson respected Hailes's intellectual prowess as manuscripts of his Annals of Scotland were submitted, via Boswell, to Johnson for his literary opinion. Johnson claimed T never before read Scotch history with certainty' Allan, p 37 and wrote to Boswell calling them 'a new mode of history which tells all that is wanted ... without laboured splendour of language, or affected subtilty [sic] of conjectur. Sir David inherited the house in 1751. He had it remodelled and the stable block added in 1790 by James Craig. But the most important room at Newhailes is the library. From the 1750s as head of the family, Sir David Dalrymple, the law lord Lord Hailes was a key figure in the Scottish Enlightenment, along with Adam Smith and David Hume who borrowed extensively from the library. At the mahogany desk which stands in the shuttered gloom of the two-storey library he wrote the 'Annals of Scottish History', known as the first \\"modern\\" history of Scotland. After his death the house passed to Christian Dalrymple. = Miss Christian Dalrymple of New Hailes (1765‚Äì1839) = In 1792, Miss Christian Dalrymple of New Hailes (30 December 1765 ‚Äì 9 January 1839) daughter of Anne Brown and David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes; inherited the Newhailes estate in East Lothian, Scotland, unexpectedly. She never married and lived there for 46 years. She lavished attention on the surrounding estate and developed the designed landscape including the flower garden. She also used the library as a ballroom, an able manager and socialite hosting glittering dances and soir√©es long into the night. She kept a diary discussing and reflecting on the minutiae of her day. It is forms part of Newhailes collection. She died at the age of seventy-two, leaving the estate to her nephew, Charles Fergusson, to whom she was a sort of surrogate mother, as his mother died when he was young. = Sir Charles Dalrymple Fergusson, 5th Baronet (1800‚Äì1849) = Sir Charles Dalrymple Fergusson, 5th Baronet of Kilkerran FRSE (1800‚Äì1849) was a Scottish lawyer.He was educated at Harrow, and became an advocate in 1822, practising at the Scottish bar until his father's death. He was a member of the Speculative Society, and at its meetings read two essays, one on the 'Origin and Progress of Criminal Jurisprudence', and the other on the 'History of Painting'. In 1829 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1837, Fergusson succeeded to the estates of his grandfather, Lord Hailes, in East and Mid Lothian, and in 1838 to those of his father in Ayrshire, on which he constantly lived. He inherited Newhailes, and the Lordship and Barony of Hailes in 1839, on the death of his aunt, Miss Christian Dalrymple (when he also assumed the additional surname of Dalrymple). Fergusson married Helen, daughter of the David Boyle, lord-justice-general of Scotland, by whom he had nine children. He died at Inveresk 18 March 1849. Entrance to stable courtyard  The last Dalrymples - 19th - 21st century  = Sir Charles Dalrymple, 1st Baronet (1839‚Äì1916) = Born Charles Fergusson, he was the second surviving son of Sir Charles Dalrymple Fergusson, 5th Baronet, and grandson of Sir James Fergusson, 4th Baronet, and his wife Jean, daughter of David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes. Sir James Fergusson, 6th Baronet, was his elder brother. On the death of his father in 1849 he assumed the surname of Dalrymple in lieu of Fergusson. He was educated at Harrow schooll and Trinity College, Cambridge, became a Scottish Conservative politician. He was created a baronet, of New Hailes in the County of Midlothian, in 1887, and sworn of the Privy Council, in 1905. He was married to Alice Mary Hunter Blair (1852-1889) daughter of Sir Edward, 4th Hunter-Blair baronet. They divided their time between London and Newhailes. The house was substantially modernised in 1907. In the late 1890s Newhailes entertained politicians such as the Speaker of the House of Commons Arthur Peel, 1st Viscount Peel. Frequently Joseph Chamberlain best known as the leading imperialist of the day in Britain, as a Liberal Unionist before he joined the Colonial Office, and John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, a landed aristocrat, industrial magnate and philanthropist. He was related to the Royal House of Stuart and the Coutts banking family. His visit coincided with his involvement with a notable company law case, relating to the insolvency of the Cardiff Savings Bank (1892) concerning a duty of care to which he was acquitted. The Times would typically report the arrivals and departures of prominent people, as they did on 25 October 1901: ‚ÄúMr. and Mrs. Chamberlain arrived in Edinburgh yesterday evening, the right hon. gentleman having engaged to address a meeting there today. The Colonial Secretary was received by Sir Charles Dalrymple, M.P., whose guest he will be at Newhailes, Musselburgh, during his visit, and after being introduced to several prominent members of the local Unionist party he drove away with his host amid cheers.‚Äù Much later in 1926 and again in 1935 the house hosted Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, Queen Victoria's granddaughter on her way to Balmoral. She was guest of Archibald Kennedy, 4th Marquess of Ailsa styled Earl Cassilis until 1938, and David Dalrymple's sister in law, Frances Countess Cassillis (n√©e McTaggart-Stewart) who were renting the house at the time. Their first daughter, Christian Elizabeth Louise, was born in 1875, their son David Charles Herbert Dalrymple born in London 1879, and their youngest daughter Alice Mary born in 1884. Five years later, Alice Mary, Charles's wife, died. In bereavement, feeling unable to offer a family environment, he sent his children away to relatives. Alice (5yrs) was sent to her Aunt Eleanor, wife of the Rector of Hartlebury in Worcestershire. David (10 yrs) and his older sister Christian (14 yrs) were sent to his mother's sister Aunt Dorothea, who had married a career naval captain David Boyle, who had fought at the Crimea -later becoming David Boyle, 7th Earl of Glasgow at Shewalton House in Ayrshire. Around 1901, the two daughters were reunited with their father, taking up residence at his London house in Onslow Gardens. Where he died in June 1916. Christian married a Royal Naval officer Commander John Saumarez Dumaresq, in 1907. The wedding was held at St. Peter's Episcopal Church, Musselburgh. She had five children and died in 1932. Alice never married, she became the sole beneficiary of her brother David's will, and lived quietly at Halkerston Lodge in Inveresk Village where she died in 1959. Sir Charles Will was carefully drawn up under Scottish law by the old established firm of Messrs. Hope, Todd & Kirk W S from their offices in Charlotte Square Edinburgh. The Will was published testate later that year on December 19, 1916.Sir Charles Dalrymple (1839-1916) Will, Vol.589, p15, (161) 18 Dec 1916 It began, ‚ÄúI, the Right Honourable Sir Charles Dalrymple of Newhailes Baronet, Privy Councillor, being desirous of settling the succession to my means and estate after my death, and of securing as far as I can that my said lands and estate of Newhailes shall not be sold, it being my desire that they be retained in the family,...‚Äù Clearly aware of his only son's character, his will was specific in its terms. The estate was to be held in trust by four trustees Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet (his nephew), Forbes Hunter Blair (brother-in-law), Honourable George John Gordon Bruce Lord Balfour of Burleigh, seventh Lord Balfour of Burleigh, a cousin, and his son David. On his father's death Sir David became a relatively wealthy man. Sir Charles had left around ¬£90,000 (¬£5 million today) in cash and stocks plus Newhailes House, its estate together with his house in London. = Sir David Charles Herbert Dalrymple, 2nd Baronet (1879‚Äì1932) = Influenced by David Boyles extensive career in the Royal Navy, David enrolled in the Britannia Royal Naval College as a thirteen-year-old Midshipman. It was during his career in the navy he met Margaret Anna Mactaggart-Stewart at a London party, whilst on leave serving as Lieutenant with HMS Falcon (1899), they married in St George's Hanover Square Church on 3 April 1906. His career in the Royal Navy was chequered with various disciplinary actions concerning conduct. He was eventually dismissed the service in 1918. They had a daughter Dorothea Mary in March 1912, who tragically died in November 1914. They had a son Charles Mark Dalrymple in May 1915. David and Margaret divorced in 1919, after his widely publicised affair at the Royal Albion Hotel in Brighton with actress Mrs Dorothy Lewis, 20 years his junior. After the divorce, Margaret Dalrymple decided to leave Newhailes and live with her sister Susanna in Maypole Ayrshire. There followed an advertisement appeared in The Times on 12 November 1919. ‚ÄúSituation - the Mansion-House of Newhailes is situated about 5 miles from the Post Office, Edinburgh; 16 minutes by rail from Waverley Station or 45 minutes by tramcar from Edinburgh and 5 minutes from Musselburgh. The house is 18th century with a fine front and circular flight of steps to front door, and a courtyard in front with pillared entrance. The interior is very hansome and ornate, with richly panelled walls and pictures inset. At the back there is a grass park of 2¬Ω acres surrounded by terraces. There is a private entrance from Newhailes station to the grounds.‚Äù The advertisement went on to describe the number of bedrooms, reception rooms and facilities, saying the drainage was in good order and the house connected to the Edinburgh telephone exhange (Musselburgh 132). Asking interested parties to contact Messrs. Hope Todd and Kirk W S of 19 Charlotte Street, Edinburgh. The house it seems was difficult to rent, and it was again advertised in February 1920 and repeated in May and again in August. By December 1921 it was again advertised to let in The Times and The Scotsman hoping to attract a family by adding: David married Dorothy Lewis in London in August 1923; she became Lady Dorothy Mirabelle Cynthia Dalrymple. They lived in London, both hedonistic, they partied, largely neglecting Newhailes, which was eventually leased to the Earl and Countess of Cassillis, Marquess of Ailsa, Margaret's elder married sister, from the trustees. Their social lifestyle put demands on the Newhailes trustees and various house antiques were sold at auction at Sotheby's and Frank Partridge & Sons. Within a few years, the actress and the peer had drifted apart, leading separate lives, Dorothy went back to the theatre, and David eventually died of a heart attack at his flat near Regent's Park, in Walton House, Longford Street on 2 December 1932 age 53. A month before he had changed his will, stating ‚Äú I give devise appoint and bequeath all my real and personal property of whatever nature or kind and wheresoever situate unto my said sister Alice Dalrymple absolutely....‚ÄùDalrymple Testate Papers: Sir DCH's will, record of Deeds and Inventory, 20 Feb 1933 Using Scottish law, he essentially had disinherited Dorothy. She however, married Frederick William Hartman in 1933, became a successful Mayfair hostess, inherited his business Lendrum & Hartman Limited and died in 1957. = Sir Mark Dalrymple, 3rd Baronet (1915‚Äì1971) died without issue = After his parents‚Äô divorce, his mother married Sir Patrick Graham Blake Blake baronets in 1925, he died five years later.There is a portrait of Margaret, Lady Blake, Previously Lady Dalrymple, Wife of Sir Charles Dalrymple painted in 1909 by F.

They left England for New York on the Cunard SS Berengaria SS Imperator in November 1935, across the US to San Francisco and on to Honolulu in December, later Australia. They returned to England via Ceylon Sri Lanka by P&O; SS RMS Strathaird in May 1936. He served with Royal Scots Territorials 1937 to 1940, then in 1941, during the Second World War, joined the Royal Air Force. Mark married Antonia Marian Amy Isabel Stewart, in 1946 the only daughter of Randolph Stewart, 12th Earl of Galloway a military man, and his American wife Philippa Wendell, whose sister was married to Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon, whose father had funded archaeologist Howard Carter when he discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun.

The Government accepted around seven-thousand volumes from the Newhailes Library, the collection included: history and biography (c. 1,800 volumes), classical and modern literature (c. 2,500 volumes), law, politics and economics (c. 1,000 volumes), and theology (c. 750 volumes).https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27I+may+perhaps+have+said+this%27%3A+Samuel+Johnson+and+Newhailes+Library.-a0451310084 In 1997, Newhailes house was given to the National Trust for Scotland by his wife Lady Antonia Dalrymple because the cost of upkeep had become impossible and the house was in danger of falling into disrepair. It was to allow to grow old gracefully through a pioneering conservation policy which does ‚Äòas much as is necessary, but as little as possible‚Äô to keep the house in good order without disturbing its ‚Äòuntouched‚Äô atmosphere. In 2002, Prince Charles made a visit to the opening of Newhailes House with NTS curator Ian Gow.http://www.icom-cc.org/ul/cms/fck-uploaded/documents/DEMHIST%20_%20ICOM- CC%20Joint%20Interim%20Meeting%202012/03-Gow_Meredith-DEMHIST_ICOMCC- LA_2012.pdf In the following years visitors to the estate had achieved in excess of 100,000 pa.https://www.nts.org.uk/Downloads/Properties/Newhailes%20Access%20Plan.pdf In 2016, the National Trust announced a ¬£2.4 million investment plan to be spent on conservation, landscape enhancement, and on commercial and visitor services improvements. In 2019, the National Trust for Scotland reported that it was undertaking a large-scale exercise to rid the house of moth infestation. = Artwork on display in house = A number of painting are on display within the house, largely Dalrymple family portraits by Scottish painter Allan Ramsay (artist),(1713-1784) and selection of local landscapes by James Norie (1711-1736).https://wikioo.org/museumbycity.php?id=The+National+Trust+For+Scotland+%28Musselburgh%2C+United+Kingdom%29 There is a landscape (1816) by John Thomson of Duddingston (1778-1840) featuring the ancestral Hailes Castle and Traprain Law, on display in the library. = The house facilities = After it was acquired by the Scottish National Trust, It is open to the public by way of guided tours.https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/newhailes/planning-your-visit It now offers a location for weddings, corporate events and private parties. = Newhailes Stable Block = Situated to the south-west of Newhailes House, the stables and office block was built as part of the changes initiated on the estate in 1798 (with the north and east ranges constructed in 1826). They comprise a two-storey quadrangular Classical stable court, incorporating late 17th century to mid-18th century builds in the north-west and south-west ranges.

Loudon)Desmond, p1443http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/GDL00296 =The Pleasure Grounds= Ruins of the Shell Grotto. The estate is notable for the remains of a 'Shell Grotto'. The fashion for such grottoes was at its height in the later 18th century, popularised by precedents at Stourhead estate, in Wiltshire c.1748, and Pope's villa Grotto in Twickenham, c.1725. The Newhailes Grotto was Commissioned by Lord Hailes, built c.1785, as a pleasure ground to the north of the house. There are the remains of square plan rocaille grotto set in woodlands, currently roofless. The interior formerly lined with decorative sea shell patterns, mounted on timber panels, of which only remnants remain in woodland around. In addition a 'Tea House' standing upon a Palladian bridge with views of cascades and waterfalls. The 'Ladies' Walk' on its raised terrace between the Cow and Sheep Parks is thought to be unique in Scotland. =Newhailes railway station (closed 1950)= The station stood where the Newhailes Road (A6095) bridge crosses the rail track to Newcraighall Road. The house and estate had its own private entrance. First recorded as 'New Hailes' this station stood within the estate but served the town of Musselburgh as well as the estate from 1847 to 1950. The station name was changed from 'NEW HAILES' to 'NEWHAILES' in September 1938. The station opened sometime after the opening of the Musselburgh branch in 1847, and closed on 2 February 1950. The platform buildings are now occupied by Niddrie Bowling Club.https://canmore.org.uk/site/153103/newhailes-station https://www.railscot.co.uk/locations/N/Newhailes_Junction/  Sources  * Abstract National Library of Scotland, Samuel Johnson and Newhailes Library.//www.thefreelibrary.com/%27I+may+perhaps+have+said+this%27%3A+Samuel+Johnson+and+Newhailes+Library.-a0451310084 * Allan, David, Making British Culture: English Leaders and the Scottish Enlightenment, 1740-1830 (London: Routledge, 2008), p. 37\\\\. * Broadie, Alexander, The Scottish Enlightenment: the Historical Age of the Historical Nation (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2007), pp. 26‚Äì27. * Brown, Ian, General Editor, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Volume 2, Enlightenment, Britain and Empire 1707-1918, Edinburgh University Press, 2007. * Cadel, Patrick, 'Dalrymple, Sir David, third baronet, Lord Hailes (1726-1792)', Oxford Dictionary of National biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004). * Carnie, R.H., A biographical and Critical Study of the Life and Writings of Sir David Dairymple (doctoral thesis, University of St Andrews, 1954).

It was released on August 1, 2017 through Warp Records as the lead single from her debut studio album, Take Me Apart (2017). Composition \\"LMK\\" is an electro-R&B; track which revolves around \\"a wobbly, three-note synth-bass\\" with Kelela singing about a \\"potential one- night-stand.\\" The bass-heavy and industrial production was handled by Jam City. Briana Younger of Pitchfork noted that Jam City's \\"pristine soundscape, while more minimal than what Kelela usually sings over, complements her well with its blend of space-age clubbiness and sultry R&B.; It makes for what is probably her most pop-accessible song to date, an empowered and liberating song that asserts not just a woman's agency, but also Kelela's power as an artist.\\" Release and promotion \\"LMK\\" premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show on August 1, 2017, and subsequently released for digital download and streaming.

The video is essentially a grand unveiling featuring Kelela wearing different wigs and guises as she pushes through the club with her friends, ultimately revealing herself at the end of the video. The message of this video is empowerment: it's for the girls, for anyone whose heart has been trampled on and deserves to go out and feel good about themselves.

Miriam Coyri√®re was born in London, England, when her parents were traveling and visiting relatives there. She was of English ancestry, the Hopkins family on her father's side, who settled in New England and were prominent in the history of the Colonies, and on her mother's side the Archer family, at one time the owners of Fordham Manor, in Westchester County, New York. Lord John Archer received the letters patent on the estate in November, 1671. He was a descendant of Fulbert L'Archer, one of the companions of William the Conqueror. The manor was mortgaged in 1686 to Cornelius Van Steenwyk, a New York merchant, and he left it by will to the Dutch Church of New York. On her mother's side the families have been Episcopalians since the establishment of the Episcopal Church in England; on her father's side they have belonged to the same church for over one-hundred years. Coyri√®re inherited literary talent from her mother, who was both poet and artist. Her father, who was wealthy at the time of his marriage, was a talented and highly educated man, and he turned his attainments to account when his fortune was swept away. He was a fine linguist and an author. Coyriere belonged to a family of six children. Career E. Miriam Coyri√®re was a member of the National Education Association, of the Woman's Health Association and of other organizations. Aided by Peter Cooper, Coyri√®re became a teacher, after a course of study in Cooper Institute. After teaching for a time, she learned the school furniture business. In 1880 she opened the \\"E. Miriam Coyriere Teachers' Agency\\" at 150 Fifth avenue, Manhattan, that earned a worldwide reputation. She worked diligently to build it up and succeeded. She supplied teachers for every grade of educational institution, from colleges down to district schools, and her patrons were in every State of the Union and in Canada, in Central America, Mexico and South America, and she supplied teachers for European institutions as well. In 1884 she displayed furniture and school apparatus at the International Congress in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she won a diploma. Personal life Coyri√®re's first marriage was unfortunate. Her husband failed, and her parents died and left three young sons to her and her sister's care. To add to her labor, her first husband became an invalid from paralysis. Her only son died in infancy. Coyriere's second husband was Professor Carlos Pardo, a writer on pedagogy, whom she married in 1884. Both were members of the American Association of Science, and Coyriere, who kept her business name, E. Miriam Coyriere, was interested in all the reform movements of the time. Their home was a center of intellectual activity. References Category:American women educators Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century ","title":"E.

(D.D.C. Sep. 30, 2004) (Naming the eleven defendants as Philip Morris, Inc., now Philip Morris USA, Inc. (\\"Philip Morris\\"), R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., now Reynolds American (\\"R.J. Reynolds\\"), Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., now part of Reynolds American (\\"Brown & Williamson\\"), Lorillard Tobacco Company (\\"Lorillard\\"), The Liggett Group, Inc. (\\"Liggett\\"), American Tobacco Co., merged with Brown & Williamson which is now part of Reynolds American (\\"American Tobacco\\"), Philip Morris Cos., now Altria (\\"Altria\\"), B.A.T. Industries p.l.c. (\\"BAT Ind.\\"), now part of BATCo, British American Tobacco (Investments) Ltd. (\\"BATCo\\"), The Council for Tobacco Research-- U.S.A., Inc. (\\"CTR\\"), and The Tobacco Institute, Inc. (\\"TI\\")). in the United States District Court of the District of Columbia (\\"District Court\\"). The complaint alleged that the tobacco companies had engaged in an approximately fifty-year conspiracy to fraudulently deceive the American public about the health effects of smoking and environmental tobacco smoke, the addictiveness of nicotine, the health benefits from low tar, \\"light\\" cigarettes, and their manipulation of the design and composition of cigarettes in order to sustain nicotine addiction. According to the complaint, the tobacco companies deliberately sought to deny that smoking caused disease and to maintain that there was no scientific consensus on the subject. In furtherance of this strategy, Defendants allegedly issued deceptive press releases, published false and misleading articles, destroyed and concealed documents which indicated that there was in fact a correlation between smoking and disease, and aggressively targeted children as potential new smokers. The lawsuit sought to recover health care expenditures the government had paid and would have to pay to treat tobacco-related illnesses as a result of the tobacco companies' unlawful action under three federal statutes: the Medical Care Recovery Act (\\"MCRA),42 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 2651- 2653. the Medicare Secondary Payer (\\"MSP\\") provisions,42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1395y. and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\\"RICO\\").18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1961-1968. Additionally, the government requested injunctive relief under the RICO Act to prevent the tobacco companies from engaging in further fraud and to disgorge the companies' ill-gotten proceeds from their illegal activity. = Proceedings = Defendants moved to dismiss the case on all counts, and in September 2000, the District Court granted their motion in part, dismissing the MCRA and MSP claims and preventing the government from recovering tobacco-related health care expenditures. However, the court allowed the case to proceed on the RICO claims. Under RICO, the Government sought injunctive relief and $289 billion in disgorgement of defendants' ill-gotten gains from the alleged conspiracy. Defendants appealed the requested relief to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\\"DC Circuit\\"). On interlocutory appeal, the DC Circuit determined that disgorgement is not a permissible remedy in civil RICO cases because injunctive relief must be \\"forward looking\\" to prevent and restrain future violations.396 F.3d 1190 (D.C. Cir. 2004) The Government continued to seek monetary damages to fund smoking cessation and prevention programs, and in 2005, the Department of Justice amended its requested relief for these programs from $130 billion over 25 years to $14 billion over ten years. At this time, several public health groups joined the lawsuit as intervenors for the purpose of asserting their interests in the proposed relief.  Opinion of the court  On August 17, 2006, Judge Gladys Kessler issued a landmark 1,683-page opinion holding the tobacco companies liable for conspiracy and violations of RICO by fraudulently covering up the health risks associated with cigarettes and for marketing their products to children.9F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2006). Kessler wrote that the tobacco companies \\"have marketed and sold their lethal product with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted.\\" Because the DC Circuit held that RICO permits only forward-looking remedies to prevent and restrain future violations, Judge Kessler ruled that the tobacco companies could not be made to fund the smoking cessation and awareness programs. The ruling ordered the following injunctive relief: = Prohibition of Brand Descriptors = The court found that the only way to restrain defendants from their longstanding and continuing fraudulent efforts to deceive smokers, potential smokers, and the American public about \\"light\\" and \\"low tar\\" cigarettes was to prohibit them from using any descriptor which conveys a health message. Accordingly, Judge Kessler enjoined defendants from using any descriptors indicating lower tar delivery‚Äîincluding, but not limited to, \\"low tar,\\" \\"light,\\" \\"mild,\\" \\"medium\\" and \\"ultra-light\\"‚Äîwhich create the false impression that such cigarettes are less harmful to smokers. = Corrective Communications = The trial record established that defendants had made false, deceptive, and misleading public statements about cigarettes, and the court found that an injunction ordering them to issue corrective statements is appropriate and necessary to prevent and restrain them from making fraudulent public statements on smoking and health matters in the future. Judge Kessler ordered defendants to make corrective statements about: (1) addiction, (2) the adverse health effects of smoking), (3) the adverse health effects of exposure to second-hand smoke, (4) the manipulation of the cigarettes to enhance nicotine delivery, and (5) the health benefits of \\"light\\" and \\"low tar\\" cigarettes. Defendants were required to publish these statements in newspapers and disseminate them through television, advertisements, onsets, in retail displays, and on their corporate websites. = Disclosure of Documents and Disaggregated Marketing Data = The court determined that defendants' suppression and concealment of information was integral to their efforts to defraud the American public, and that defendants had failed to disclose, and created false controversy over the existence of, information they possessed about cigarettes. Judge Kessler ordered that the tobacco companies must create and maintain document depositories and websites which provide the government and the public with access to all industry documents disclosed in the litigation. Additionally, defendants must provide their disaggregated marketing data to the government to ensure transparency of their marketing efforts, particularly those directed towards youth.  Outcome  All parties appealed Judge Kessler's 2006 decision to the DC Circuit. In 2009, a three- judge panel unanimously upheld Judge Kessler's finding of liability and upheld most of the ordered remedies.566 F.3d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 2009). A subsequent appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court. = Challenges to the Corrective Statements = Judge Kessler ordered the tobacco companies to make corrective statements on five topics about which they had historically deceived and misled the public. The specific language of these statements was not included in the 2006 ruling, but the parties were to submit proposals for approval by the court. The tobacco companies appealed to the DC Circuit, challenging the corrective-disclosure remedy under both RICO and the First Amendment. The DC Circuit upheld the corrective statements as a valid remedy in 2009, finding that requiring defendants to reveal the previously hidden truth about their products will prevent and restrain them from disseminating false and misleading statements, thereby violating RICO, in the future. However, the statements must be confined to purely factual and uncontroversial information, intended to thwart efforts to either directly mislead consumers or capitalize on prior deceptions by continuing to advertise in a manner that builds on consumers' existing misperceptions. The DC Circuit also vacated a requirement that the statements be published on retail displays, instructing the District Court to consider the third-party implications of this remedy on remand. In 2012, Judge Kessler released specific language for the five corrective statements based on proposals submitted by all parties after the 2009 DC Circuit ruling. The tobacco companies were ordered to make the corrective statements through television and newspaper advertising, on their websites, and on cigarette packaging. In a series of subsequent appeals, defendants challenged the language proposed by the court, claiming that portions of the selected text violated their First Amendment rights and were intended to humiliate them and disclose prior wrongdoing rather than prevent and restrain future RICO violations.907 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2012).801 F .3d 250, 261-63 (D.C. Cir. 2015). These appeals resulted in modifications to the language of proposed statements. The language of the corrective statements was not finalized until June 2017. Still at issue is whether the court can order the corrective statements be posted at retail establishments ‚Äì or the \\"point-of- sale\\" (\\"POS\\") ‚Äì for tobacco products.

The duo had been making tracks since 2007 but did not decide to release a full-length album until much later because of their concerns over listeners really wanted an LP from them. In making the record, Classixx went for a record with \\"hooky melod[ies],\\" \\"some nice chords,\\" and a positive feel-good tone while still having depth not common in dance music. Hanging Garden is an electropop album that contains elements of a wide variety of genres such as French dance music, rock, Chicago house, R&B;, techno, and balearic beat. The LP features collaborations from acts such as Nancy Whang, Active Child, Sarah Chernoff, Jeppe, and Jesse Kivel. Promoted with single releases for \\"I'll Get You,\\" \\"Holding On,\\" and \\"All You're Waiting For\\" and music videos for the songs \\"Holding On,\\" \\"All You're Waiting For,\\" and \\"Stranger Love,\\" Hanging Gardens was distributed by Innovative Leisure and Future Classic on May 14, 2013. Responses from professional reviewers were favorable in general and ranked in the top 50 of numerous year-end lists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Gigwise, and Billboard; some critics called it superior from most other dance albums due to its songwriting, while some were more critical of the LP's instrumental tracks and repetitiveness. Thump has ranked it the 84th best dance album ever released. The LP also did well commercially, landing in the top 15 on the American Billboard Independent Albums and Heatseekers Albums charts. Background Classixx had been working on songs since 2007. For a while, they were very skeptical about making a studio album.

However, Classixx intended to create collaborations for the LP at least as possible, Blake reasoning that ‚Äúwhen you make a record represented by the collaborations, you get lost in your sound.\\" They also didn't want to use acts that were very popular but rather actual friends to work with because, as David explained, \\"when you have these albums with like, big names to help propel the record, it can feel really disjointed and you don‚Äôt get great work because they‚Äôre doing you a favor.\\"Fan Fiction (2013). \\"Interview: Classixx\\".

The organ and communion rails were brought from a church at Brompton Ralph in 1910. Further restoration was undertaken in 1923 by Ninian Comper. The church is away from the main village, close to Bagborough House. The location of the church away from the village is believed to be a result of an outbreak of Black Death, when may of the villagers died. They then abandoned the area around the church and rebuilt houses further down the hill. The lychgate is dedicated to the memory of Robert Brooke-Popham. The parish is part of the benefice of Bishop's Lydeard with Lydeard Saint Lawrence, Combe Florey and Cothelstone within the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture The red sandstone building has a tiled roof. It consists of a chancel, a nave and aisle each with three bays with wagon roofs. The south porch was added in 1643. The three-stage west tower is supported by diagonal buttresses. The tower has six bells. Inside the church is a tablet with the names of the men from the village who died in World War I.

History Current view of the area showing a new residential development on the site (just over the bridge on the right hand side) The building was designed as the headquarters of the 1st (Hertfordshire) Volunteer Battalion, The Bedfordshire Regiment and was completed at a cost of ¬£2,000 in 1898. This unit evolved to become the Hertfordshire Battalion, The Bedfordshire Regiment in 1908 and then the 1st Battalion, The Hertfordshire Regiment in 1909. The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the Western Front. Approximately 100,000 rounds of ammunition were stored in the drill hall at that time ready for issue to soldiers who were about to see action in the First World War. The battalion was still located at the drill hall when it was mobilised for service in the Second World War. The battalion was absorbed into the 3rd East Anglian Regiment in 1958. However the British Army continued to maintain a presence at Port Hill drill hall, for the training of both Territorial Army personnel and of cadets. Nevertheless the drill hall eventually became surplus to requirements: it was decommissioned and subsequently demolished and, in 2003, a new residential development, which won the 2004/2005 Civic Design Award, was created in its place.

History  Ikebana sh≈çka flower arrangement in bamboo basket, by the 40th headmaster Ikenob≈ç Senj≈ç (from the S≈çka Hyakki, 1820) kagome pattern (1915) More than six hundred species of bamboo grow in Japan, including Phyllostachys bambusoides, which can grow to a height of 15‚Äì22 m and a diameter of 10‚Äì15 cm. Some species are endemic to Japan. Although defined as a subfamily of grasses, bamboo is characterized by its woody culm and a root system that can form either thick, slowly spreading clusters or more aggressive runners. The bamboo has unique characteristics which naturally give it a positive symbolic significance: it grows straight and fast, is flexible, does not decay quickly and can be used for building shelters, weapons, instruments, and cut into stripes for making containers. Young bamboo stems can even be eaten and have found their way into the Japanese cuisine. Bamboo is a common theme in Japanese literature and a favoured subject of painters. Along with the evergreen pine and plum, which is the first flower of spring, bamboo is a part of the traditional Three Friends of Winter. The three are a symbol of steadfastness, perseverance, and resilience. Japanese artists have often represented bamboo enduring inclement weather, such as rain or snow, reflecting its reputation for being flexible but unbreakable, and its association with steadfastness and loyalty. The most favoured sort used in Japanese craft is the Phyllostachys bambusoides species, called madake („Éû„ÉÄ„Ç±) in Japanese. Flower baskets for ikebana called hanakago (Ëä±Á±†) and other types were imported from China or their style copied. These karamono (Chinese-style, ÂîêÁâ©) baskets had formal, symmetrical structures with tightly plaited weaves. It was the 16th-century tea master Sen no Riky≈´ (1522‚Äì1591) who advocated for a simple, austere wabi-cha style with natural and spontaneous or seemingly artless utensils. These tea utensils established a Japanese bamboo art distinct from the imported Chinese style. Baskets were developed to appear in a natural, asymmetric style, called wamono (Japanese-style, ÂíåÁâ©). Around 1700 the embrace of the steeped sencha tea ceremony coincided with a renewed admiration for Chinese culture, literature, and painting among the Japanese literati, a phenomenon that continued into the 19th century. Finely woven, elegant baskets imported from China served as models for karamono baskets now created by Japanese craftsmen, following a tradition established during the Muromachi period (1392‚Äì1573). Recognition of bamboo craftsmanship as a traditional Japanese decorative art began at the end of the 19th century, and became accepted as an art form. The Bamboo Technical Training Support Centre in the town of ≈åita was established in 1938, making it the only publicly funded prefectural- level institution in the country that is dedicated to bamboo crafts. Following World War II, bamboo crafts disappeared as plastic replaced it for utilitarian products. Nevertheless, high-level production remained and art forms developed apart from crafts. Bamboo art gained increasing recognition. In 1967 Sh≈çn≈ç Sh≈çunsai (ÁîüÈáéÁ••Èõ≤Êñé, 1904‚Äì1974) from Beppu became the first bamboo artist to be nominated by the government as a Living National Treasure. In 1979, Bamboo crafts of Beppu were designated by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in 1979 as a Traditional Arts and Crafts. Most of the master artisans designated Living National Treasures are selected from among participants in the annual Japan K≈çgei Association exhibitions. Whereas the annual Japan Art Academy exhibitions (Êó•Â±ï, Nitten) emphasize artistic expression, the Art and Crafts exhibitions prioritize the preservation of traditional skills and typically feature functional, though modern, baskets. In the postwar era, many of the leading bamboo artists were linked to established lineages. Although most artists are men, a number of female artists have emerged recently,https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/essay/bamboo- tradition-in-contemporary-form/ such as Toshie ≈åki (Â§ßÊú® Ê∑ëÊÅµ), and Setsuko Isohi (Á£ØÈ£õ ÁØÄÂ≠ê, b. 1964). Bamboo art of recent decades reflects a greater diversity in technique and vision, though the same respect for tradition, areas, and lineage that characterizes the history of the medium is still manifest in many ways. Notable artists have come to the craft from outside the traditional family lines, and many of them work independently. Some have a background in the fine arts, while others found themselves attracted to the ancient practice after having worked in an unrelated field. As is similar in other Japanese crafts, the acquisition of knowledge usually involved a lengthy apprenticeship with the master of the workshop, often the father of the young disciple, in a system called shitei (Â∏´Âºü). Learning the basic skills and techniques generally takes five to ten years, but mastering them and developing an individual style can require decades. Hard work was required from the pupil almost every day in exchange for little or no pay. Living in the master's household and participating in household duties, apprentices carefully observed the master, senior students, and workshop before beginning any actual training. Even in the later stages of an apprenticeship it was common for a disciple to learn only through conscientious observation. This has changed in more recent times, as younger generations are unwilling to go through this traditional system and learn instead the basic skills in technical schools such as the centre in Oita, and later go to a master. While some works can be completed in several weeks, others take many months, and exhibition pieces often require longer, sometimes a year or two. Bamboo arts have a low profile compared to ceramics, mainly because of the comparatively low number of artisans, and the amount of time it takes to finish an object.Melissa M. Rinne. Masters of Bamboo: Artistic Lineages in the Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Basket Collection. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco. pg. 16. 2008. Bamboo basketry is often complemented with other materials such as rattan or hemp palm. Basketry of only these materials also exist. Another is tsuruzaiku („Å§„ÇãÁ¥∞Â∑•), the craft of vine weaving, which is popular in many parts of the northern T≈çhoku region where bamboo is more scarce, specifically the weaving of akebia quinata, called akebizaiku („Ç¢„Ç±„ÉìÁ¥∞Â∑•). The three main production areas of bamboo weaving are the western Kansai region around the cities of Osaka and Kyoto, the eastern Kant≈ç region around Tokyo, and the southernmost island of Ky≈´sh≈´. Each had their own plaiting techniques and styles. File:MET LC-91 1 2081-001.jpgChinese-style charcoal basket (sair≈ç-sumitori) for sencha tea ceremony. Timber bamboo, dwarf bamboo, and rattan.

Edo period, second half of 19th century = Kansai artisans = Tanabe Chikuunsai IV explaining his large-scale installation work Godai at the Mus√©e Guimet (2016) Sophisticated sencha flower baskets and tea utensil baskets were in especially high demand in the western region of Kansai, with Osaka and Kyoto at its centre. In the late 19th century, master craftsmen in the region began combining technical perfection with artistic individuality to produce functional \\"art baskets\\" that were signed by the artist. The pioneering Kansai bamboo artist Hayakawa Sh≈çkosai I (Êó©Â∑ùÂ∞öÂè§Êñé, 1815‚Äì1897), believed to be the first master to sign his baskets, studied the traditional craft of rattan plaiting and concentrated on sencha tea utensils. His eldest son, Sh≈çk≈çsai II (1860‚Äì1905), followed him into the basketry trade but died at an early age. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Sh≈çkosai III (1864‚Äì1922), who developed an advanced style of plaiting called \\"coarse weave\\", a departure from the family's signature techniques. After World War II, Sh≈çk≈çsai IV (1902‚Äì1975) moved from Osaka to Kyoto, where he established the new family workshop. Sh≈çk≈çsai V (1932‚Äì2011) explored further possibilities in armor plaiting, a type of parallel construction considered one of the traditional Hayakawa techniques.Melissa M. Rinne. Masters of Bamboo: Artistic Lineages in the Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Basket Collection. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco. pg. 24. 2008. He exhibited his work at the annual Japanese Traditional Art Crafts Exhibitions beginning in 1966 and was designated a Living National Treasure in 2003. The Osaka-based bamboo artist Wada Waichisai I (ÂíåÁî∞Âíå‰∏ÄÊñé, 1851‚Äì1901) established an important and long-lasting lineage of masters.Melissa M. Rinne. Masters of Bamboo: Artistic Lineages in the Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Basket Collection. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco. pg. 25. 2008. He was known for his precise, delicate plaiting techniques, making primarily karamono (Chinese-style) baskets and utensils for the sencha tea ceremony. Among his numerous disciples was Tanabe Chikuunsai I (Âàù‰ª£Áî∞Ëæ∫Á´πÈõ≤Êñé, 1877‚Äì1937), who both perpetuated inherited traditions and began to modernize them.Melissa M. Rinne. Masters of Bamboo: Artistic Lineages in the Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Basket Collection. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco. pg. 26. 2008. He developed the so-called ry≈´riky≈ç style of basketry after studying the 18th century paintings of Yanagisawa Kien, who often depicted bamboo baskets filled with flowers or fruits in the bunjin literati style. Chikuunsai made ry≈´riky≈ç baskets explicitly for exhibition, a trend that marked a significant shift in Japanese bamboo art, reflecting the ambition of master craftsmen to achieve the same degree of recognition already accorded contemporary ceramic and lacquer artists. Tanabe Chikuunsai II (1910‚Äì2000) and Chikuunsai III (1940‚Äì2014) extended the Tanabe lineage, with the latter producing unique geometric sculptures.Melissa M. Rinne. Masters of Bamboo: Artistic Lineages in the Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Basket Collection. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco. pg. 27. 2008. The Sakai-based Tanabe Chikuunsai IV (b. 1973) has carried on the family tradition while also experimenting with monumental sculpture and organic installation works, such as the almost 6 metres high Godai at the Mus√©e Guimet in 2016, or with The Gate in 2017 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Another disciple of Wada Waichisai I was Yamamoto Chikury≈´sai I (Âàù‰ª£Â±±Êú¨Á´πÈæçÊñéÈÄ†, 1868‚Äì1945), who received awards at the 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris, the 1933 Century of Progress fair in Chicago, and the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in Paris. He was also one of the first bamboo craftsmen whose work was admitted to the Teiten exhibition of the Imperial Fine Arts Academy. Maeda Chikub≈çsai I (Âàù‰ª£ÂâçÁî∞Á´πÊàøÊñé, 1872‚Äì1950), also from Sakai, established his own distinguished family line. He began his career producing karamono and literati baskets, but then developed a unique method of using natural bamboo branches and roots to achieve a more rustic effect. He also made several pieces for the Imperial Court. Chikub≈çsai II (1917‚Äì2003) produced both sencha baskets and modern vessels made from round strips of bent-and-gathered bamboo. Beginning in the Taish≈ç era, both Tanabe Chikuunsai I and Maeda Chikub≈çsai I incorporated antique arrows into their work, which was particularly appreciated by clients who were descended from samurai. He was followed by his on Maeda Chikub≈çsai II (‰∫å‰ª£ÂâçÁî∞Á´πÊàøÊñéÈÄ†, 1917‚Äì2003), whose works were shown at the Nitten and who in 1995 was awarded by the government as the third bamboo artist to be named a Living National Treasure. One of the artists who was influenced by Tanabe Chikuunsai II is Sugita Jozan (b. 1932 in Osaka). Other notable artisans and artists include Suzuki Gengensai (Èà¥Êú®Áé©„ÄÖÊñéÈÄ†, 1891‚Äì1950), Higashi Takesonosai (Êù±Á´πÂúíÊñéÈÄ†, 1915‚Äì2006), who was influenced by R≈çkansai and received the Special Recognition Award (Tokusen) at the 1971 Nitten exhibition,, Tanaka K≈çsai (Áî∞‰∏≠ÁØÅÊñéÈÄ†, 1912‚Äì1993) whose also integrated the shafts of arrows into his work,, Tanaka K≈çji (Áî∞‰∏≠ËÄïÂè∏ÈÄ†, b. 1941), and Tanioka Shigeo (Ë∞∑Â≤°ËåÇÁî∑ÈÄ†, born 1949) who was an apprentice of Tanabe Chikuunsai II.

He later made a number of artistic pieces with extremely fine strips of bamboo and intricate techniques. He lives near Hiroshima in the neighbouring Ch≈´goku region. = Kant≈ç artisans = Japanese bamboo art in the eastern region of Kant≈ç around Tokyo underwent a process of modernization during the first half of the 20th century. Several masters rose to fame through their participation in newly reorganized domestic art international exhibitions and began producing \\"art baskets\\". Iizuka H≈çsai II (‰∫å‰ª£È£ØÂ°öÈ≥≥Êñé, 1872‚Äì1934) and his brother Iizuka R≈çkansai (È£ØÂ°öÁêÖÁéïÊñé, 1890‚Äì1958, born Yanosuke) spearheaded the movement, pioneering new directions for the field and elevating bamboo craft to an art form. Emphasizing artistic freedom and individuality, R≈çkansai experimented with the possibilities of the medium and developed several new techniques, including bundled plaiting (tabane-ami) and embroidered plaiting (take sashi-ami). He received an award in the 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris. Iizuka Sh≈çkansai (È£ØÂ°öÂ∞èÁéïÊñé, 1919‚Äì2004), who trained under his father, the famous R≈çkansai, regularly exhibited his works at the annual Nitten exhibition and the Traditional Art and Crafts exhibitions, and was designated a Living National Treasure in 1982. The Iizuka family traditions were transmitted to Katsushiro S≈çh≈ç (ÂãùÂüéËíºÈ≥≥ÈÄ†, b. 1934) and Fujinuma Noboru (Ëó§Ê≤ºÊòáÈÄ†, b. 1945), both Living National Treasures active in Tochigi Prefecture. Ishikawa Sh≈çun (1895‚Äì1973) was a disciple of Iizuka R≈çkansai, as was Yokota H≈çsai (Ê®™Áî∞Â≥∞ÊñéÈÄ†, 1899‚Äì1975). H≈çsai was one of the seventeen founding members of the Japan Bamboo Artists Association in 1955, along with Kosuge Sh≈çchikudo and Iizuka Sh≈çkansai. Suzuki Kyokush≈çsai I (Èà¥Êú®Êó≠ÊùæÊñéÈÄ†, 1872‚Äì1936) might have been connected to the H≈çsai linneage. Another disciple of R≈çkansai was Nakata Kinseki (‰∏≠Áî∞Èå¶Áü≥ÈÄ†, 1902‚Äì1959). Buseki Suigetsu (Ê≠¶Èñ¢Áø†ÊúàÈÄ†, 1930‚Äì2013) is an artist working in Tokyo. Fujitsuka Sh≈çsei (Ëó§Â°öÊùæÊòüÈÄ†, born 1949) had his apprenticeship under Baba Sh≈çd≈ç (1925‚Äì1996) and is based in Kanagawa. His produces installation art in a highly individualistic style.

By Iizuka H≈çsai II, Sh≈çwa era, 1924‚Äì1934 = Ch≈´bu artisans = An important Ch≈´bu lineage, specifically in the Hokuriku region, is that of Honma Kazuaki (Êú¨Èñì‰∏ÄÁßãÈÄ†, b. 1930), from Sado Island and based in Niigata Prefecture. He studied under Hayashi Sh≈çgetsusai (ÊûóÂ∞öÊúàÊñéÈÄ†, 1911‚Äì1986) He specializes in bent-bamboo works and has won renown for his large-scale abstract compositions. He further developed Iizuka Sh≈çkansai's idea of two- dimensional, framed bamboo works called \\"plaited paintings\\" and received two Special Recognition Awards (Tokusen) at the Nitten, one in 1983. His disciple Honma Hideaki (Êú¨ÈñìÁßÄÊò≠ÈÄ†, b. 1959), working on Sado Island, employs a flexible local variety of bamboo in works inspired by the island's flora and fauna. Another disciple of Honma Kazuaki was Ueno Masao (born 1949) from Iiyama, Nagano, who creates installation works. Another important lineage on Sado Island was founded by Kosuge Chikud≈ç (1895‚Äì1966), continued by his sons Kosuge Sh≈çchikud≈ç (Â∞èÁÆ°Â∞èÁ´πÂ†ÇÈÄ†, 1921‚Äì2003) and Kosuge K≈çgetsu (Â∞èËèÖÂêºÊúàÈÄ†, b. 1932). Sh≈çchikud≈ç initially had no interest in becoming a bamboo artist and did not formally study under his father. He nevertheless submitted a work which was accepted by the Tokyo Craft Arts Exhibition when he was fourteen years old. Subsequently, he worked with bamboo and after the end World War II, the Niigata Prefectural government hired him to teach bamboo basketry. His work was admitted to the Nitten exhibitions, and in 1955 he became one of the seventeen founding members of the Japan Bamboo Artists Association. He eventually stopped producing works for public exhibitions and focused towards design and small items, working for example together with fashion designer Issey Miyake. Baba Sh≈çd≈ç (1925‚Äì1996) was trained by him. His younger brother K≈çgetsu, a student of chanoyu, became renowned for the \\"twisted construction\\" (hineri-gumi) technique. He participated in both the Nitten and the Traditional Arts & Crafts exhibitions and received awards for his flower baskets. Torii Ipp≈ç (È≥•Â±Ö‰∏ÄÂ≥ØÈÄ†, 1930‚Äì2011), born in Nishio, Aichi, had to continue his family's bamboo business at the age of 21 after his father passed away. In 1959 he saw a ceremonial bamboo basket from the 8th century CE at the Sh≈çs≈çin in Nara. Inspired by this piece, he eventually submitted works to the Japanese Modern Art & Craft exhibitions and received a Special Recognition Award (Tokusen) at the 2006 Nitten. Yako H≈çd≈ç (ÂÖ´Â≠êÈ≥≥Â†ÇÈÄ†, b. 1940), originally based in Niigata Prefecture, studied under Nakajima Hoso, Nakamura Yukosai, and Baba Sh≈çd≈ç (1925‚Äì1996), who encouraged him to explore contemporary sculpture. He moved to the Tokyo area later, and made large-scale compositions for which he earned recognition. He began exhibiting his work at the Nitten in 1973. Nagakura Ken'ichi (Èï∑ÂÄâÂÅ•‰∏ÄÈÄ†, b. 1952) is an artist from Shizuoka Prefecture. He initially studied y≈´zen dyeing techniques, but moved to bamboo weaving after working at his grandfather's bamboo wholesale enterprise. His organic, sculptural baskets and three-dimensional abstract sculptural works owe their appearance to a variety of traditions. He works as an independent artist and is not associated with any particular organisations. = Ky≈´sh≈´ artisans = With a warm southern climate ideal for bamboo cultivation, the island of Ky≈´sh≈´ is the site of more than half of Japan's bamboo production. In the early 20th century, the town of Beppu in ≈åita Prefecture, famous for its hot springs, became a noted centre of bamboo crafts;Melissa M. Rinne. Masters of Bamboo: Artistic Lineages in the Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Basket Collection. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco. pg. 32. 2008. functional baskets and bamboo carvings from the area were widely exhibited. The ≈åita Prefectural Bamboo Craft and Technical Training Support Center, a publicly funded institution dedicated to bamboo craft, was established in 1938. The artist Sh≈çn≈ç Sh≈çunsai (Â±±ÈáéÁ••‰∫ëÊñã, 1904‚Äì1974) attracted numerous disciples over the course of his long career. His abstract bamboo sculptures of the 1950s and 1960s were considered revolutionary.Melissa M. Rinne. Masters of Bamboo: Artistic Lineages in the Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Basket Collection. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco. pg. 32-33. 2008. In 1967 he became the first bamboo artist honoured with the title \\"Living National Treasure\\". Sh≈çn≈ç Tokuz≈ç (b. 1942, ÁîüÈáéÂæ≥‰∏âÈÄ†), his son and heir to the family tradition, typically uses leached bamboo split into wide strips and combines parallel construction with plaiting to achieve a textural, multilayered effect.Melissa M. Rinne. Masters of Bamboo: Artistic Lineages in the Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Basket Collection. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco. pg. 33. 2008. Iwao K≈çunsai (1901‚Äì1992) established a lineage that included Kadota Nik≈ç (ÈñÄÁî∞‰∫åÁØÅÈÄ†, 1907‚Äì1994), who applied characteristic Ky≈´sh≈´ techniques, and Honda Sh≈çry≈´ (Êú¨Áî∞ËÅñÊµÅÈÄ†, b. 1951), one of his pupils, who makes undulating, complex sculptures with light, openwork textiles.Melissa M. Rinne. Masters of Bamboo: Artistic Lineages in the Lloyd Cotsen Japanese Basket Collection. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco. pg. 34. 2008. Kibe Seih≈ç (Â≤êÈÉ®Á¨ôËä≥ÈÄ†, b. 1951), one of Sh≈çry≈´'s students, prefers functional vessels and employs classical plaiting techniques. Other artists such as Uematsu Chikuy≈´ (Ê§çÊùæÁ´πÈÇëÈÄ†, b. 1947) and Shiotsuki Juran (Â°©ÊúàÂØøËóçÈÄ†, b. 1948) create unique sculptures.  Techniques  Kagome trihexagonal tiling pattern Sensuji gumi ('thousand-line') construction, or comb plaiting A number of plaiting techniques developed throughout time and in different regions.

Technically not plaiting, but aligning elements parallel to each other and then fastening them with any of the above methods. Also known as \\"parallel construction\\" (kumi ÁµÑ). * Twill plaiting, or netting plaiting (ajiro ami Á∂≤‰ª£Á∑®„Åø) * Twining (nawame ami Á∏ÑÁõÆÁ∑®„Åø)  Bamboo weaving in art  Woven bamboo flower basket from 1892‚Äì1950 by Maeda Chikub≈çsai I, in front of a by≈çbu (Edo period, 1650‚Äì1750) depicting four flower arrangements in baskets A number of art works such as paintings and pottery have taken up the theme of bamboo weaving. A design on a Nabeshima ware porcelain dish from the late 17th to early 18th century depicts falling cherry blossoms in plaided baskets on a stream. The exact meaning of what the artists and owners were trying to convey is not conclusive, but the intention was to celebrate traditional Japanese aesthetics. The falling cherry blossoms in this design most likely commemorated the association between the flower and culture, symbolised by the baskets holding them. In the kakejiku (hung scroll) Autumn Flowers in a Bamboo Basket, the Nanga artist Yosa Buson (1716‚Äì1783) painted a bouquet of autumn flowers standing in a tall Chinese-style bamboo basket with a rounded handle. The depicted flowers are chrysanthemums (kiku), Chinese bellflowers (kiky≈ç), and rose mallows (fuy≈ç), and are in full bloom in autumn. They are all therefore associated in traditional Japanese poetry with this season. The artist used a technique called sumi-nijimi, or \\"ink blurring\\", for rendering the flowers. He applied brushstrokes to the surface of ink washes before they dried, creating a soft texturing effect. For the texture of the plaited bamboo basket he used short horizontal strokes in dark ink to contrast it with the evocative flowers. A mizusashi tea ceremony water jar, 1750‚Äì1850 (Edo period), is in the shape of a bamboo basket. The water jar is made out of stoneware, with a cream slip and brown glaze, and as the image below attests, the artisan was able to realistically imitate the texture of bamboo.

The Vampiro has a fruity, lightly carbonated, and spicy taste. The Vampiro can be made with Mexican sangrita, a prepared drink mixer containing orange juice and chili peppers. One recipe lists the ingredients as tequila, limes, Kosher salt, Squirt brand citrus-flavoured soda and Viuda de Sanchez, an orange juice-based Mexican sangrita beverage. Viuda de Sanchez is sold in Mexico and in areas of the southern US with large Latino populations. If Viuda de Sanchez is not available, good quality fresh-squeezed orange juice, lime juice and spicy pico de gallo seasoning can be used as a substitute. The Vampiro is popular in Mexico and is the national drink. Mexicans named the cocktail Vampiro (\\"vampire\\") because the Viuda de Sanchez juice mixer's red colour is reminiscent of blood. Preparation Vampiros may be made in a tall glass or an old fashioned glass. Bartenders may first \\"rim\\" the glass with Kosher Salt, which is done by placing a layer of Kosher Salt on a chopping board, moistening the glass' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the Kosher Salt, so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim. The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila. The next stage is to add the flavouring elements. This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo). The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended. The Vampiro is claimed to have originated in San Luis Soyatl√°n, Mexico, created by fruit stand vendor Oscar Hern√°ndez and traditionally sold in clear plastic bags with a straw. Hern√°ndez originally prepared the drink for his own consumption, but was quickly asked to make them by his customers and the drink has spread by word of mouth. =Variants= Some bartending guides suggest adding a shot of tomato juice, fresh-squeezed orange and lime juice, grenadine syrup, hot pepper sauce and freshly-ground black pepper to the glass, and omitting the Mexican sangrita. As well, some guides suggest that the ingredients be shaken and strained, not stirred. In 2017, David Hammond from the Chicago Tribune described a variant called the Doce Vampiro cocktail, which is served at La Sirena Clandestina in Chicago. The blood-red drink is a blend of \\"...pisco, tequila, lemon, pineapple, Ramazzotti amaro and chicha morada, a sweet, tart, nonalcoholic Peruvian drink made from purple corn\\". Hammond states that the \\"...pisco, pineapple and lemon, bright and acidic, are the high notes\\", with the \\"...tequila, bitter herbaceousness of the Ramazzotti and baking-spice qualities of the chicha morada\\" providing the \\"[b]ass notes\\".

Bratono≈æiƒái and Rovci. Like other non-Slavic tribes of Montenegro, they were either assimilated or expelled. The majority of scholars consider them to have been of Albanian origin. Today, their name is preserved in local Serbian legends and myths, while their name is sometimes used in Montenegro as derogative.  Origin  Milan ≈†ufflay was the first to set the hypothesis that Macure were of Albanian origin, like Matagu≈æi, Maine, Malon≈°ƒçiƒái and Bukumiri. This hypothesis about Macure was accepted by many other authors, including Panteliƒá. Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá presented a hypothesis that one of the possibilities is that Macure are related to Albanian Macarke or Macreke. Jovan Erdeljanoviƒá believed they were of Vlach origin whose name was derived from some Roman word which basis was mazz.  Etymology  Macure might be related to the Montenegrin word maca meaning large hammer but it is used also to describe very strong as this word is used even today by people in Montenegro to describe a strong man by saying Jak ko maca! or Maca od ƒço'jeka. Also, it is common to find Montenegrin words that are of Slavic roots and end with \\"ure\\". Lju≈°ture (meaning multiple layers), ƒêevojƒçure (multiple girls). This might indicate origin of name Macure is as to say multiple of strong people.  History  Like all other non-Slavic tribes of Montenegro, Macure were also completely assimilated or expelled by Slavs.: \\"–ü–æ—Ç–ø—É–Ω–æ —Å—É –∞—Å–∏–º–∏–ª–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–≥–Ω–∞–Ω–∏ –æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ü–∏ –Ω–µ–∫–∏—Ö –≥—Ä—É–ø–∞, –∫–∞–æ —à—Ç–æ —Å—É –ú–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—É–≥–µ, –ú–∞—Ü—É—Ä–µ, –ú—É–≥–æ- —à–∏, –ö—Ä–∏—á–∫–æ–≤–∏, –ã–∏—õ–∏ –∏ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏ –í–ª–∞—Å–∏, –∫–æ—ò–∏ —Å–µ —á–µ—Å—Ç–æ –ø–æ–º–∏—ö—É –∫–∞–æ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∞ –±—Ä–∞—Ç—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞ –∏ –ø–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞. –ü–æ—Ä–µ–¥ —ö–∏—Ö —ò–æ—à –∏ –®–ø–∞—ö–∏, –Ω–∞—ò—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–∏—ò–∏ ...\\" Macure became a derogative term in Montenegro, which is the case with names of other conquered and expelled tribes of Lu≈æani, Bukumiri, Mataruge and others.: \\"...—É –¶—Ä–Ω–æ—ò –ì–æ—Ä–∏ –ø–æ–≥—Ä–¥–Ω–∏–º –æ–¥–Ω–æ—Å–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–µ–∑—Ä–∏–≤–∏–º –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏–º–∞ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∞ –ø–æ–±–µ—í–µ–Ω–∏—Ö –∏ –∏—Å—Ç–∏—Å–Ω—É—Ç–∏—Ö –ø–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞ –õ—É–∂–∞–Ω–∞, –ë—É–∫—É–º–∏—Ä–∞, –ú–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—É–≥–∞, –ú–∞—Ü—É—Ä–∞ –∏ –¥—Ä.\\" With Ottoman incursion into Serbian Despotovina and Zeta, Macure, Mataruge and Kriƒçi migrated in two directions. The first was across Eastern Bosnia and Central Bosnia, into Western and North Western Bosnia. The second was across Herzegovina and Dalmatia.  Legacy  Macure are commemorated in Serbian legends and myths. According to Serbian legends, they were tall and strong people. The Serb legends say that they saw snow for the first time when they came to Sinjajevina in Montenegro and made snowball to bring it back to show it to their friends which soon melt in their hands. According to Erdeljanoviƒá, the toponym Macur-jama in Piperi territory has its origin in the name of the Macure tribe. A word Macurovine (), a first name Macur (recorded in 1575) and a surname Macura (recorded since 17th century) is derived from the name of the Macure tribe.

The processor is designed with 16 cores, but with only 15 cores available due to yield issues; this makes more processors available since they do not need to be fully functional to pass testing. The POWER10-based processors are being manufactured by Samsung using a 7 nm process with 18 layers of metal and 18 billion transistors. The silicon die is 602 mm2 large. The main features of POWER10 are higher performance per watt, better memory and I/O architecture as well as a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Performance per watt is addressed mainly by Samsung's 7 nm fabrication process. Better I/O and memory is handled by the PowerAXON facilities, handling communications with other chips and systems, the Open Memory Interface (OMI) memory technology scaling from core caches through random-access memory (RAM) and all the way to 2 PB of unified clustered memory space shared across multiple cluster nodes and support for PCIe 5. Technologies making AI loads' performance better stems from many new features to the SIMD capacity and enabling new datatypes like bfloat16, INT4(INTEGER) and INT8(BIGINT). Systems with POWER10 are intended to reach customers in the fourth quarter or 2021. Design Each POWER10 core has doubled up on most functional units compared to its predecessor POWER9. The core is eight-way multithreaded (SMT8) and has 48 kB instruction and 32 kB data L1 caches, a 2 MB large L2 cache and a very large translation lookaside buffer (TLB) with 4096 entries. Latency cycles to the different cache stages and TLB has been reduced significantly. Each core has eight execution slices each with one floating-point unit (FPU), arithmetic logic unit (ALU), branch predictor, load‚Äìstore unit and SIMD-engine, able to be fed 128-bit (64+64) instructions from the new prefix/fuse instructions of the Power ISA v.3.1. Each execution slice can handle 20 instructions each, backed up by a shared 512 entry instruction table, and fed to 128 entry wide (64 single threaded) load queue and 80 entry (40 single threaded) wide store queue. Better branch prediction features have doubled the accuracy. A core has four matrix math assist (MMA) engines, for better handling of SIMD code, especially for matrix multiplication instructions where AI inference workloads have a 20-fold performance increase. The whole processor have two \\"hemispheres\\" with eight cores, sharing a 64 MB L3 cache for a total of 16 cores and 128 MB L3 caches. Due to yield issues, at least one core is always disabled, reducing L3 cache by 8 MB to a usable total of 15 cores and 120 MB L3 cache. Each chip also has eight crypto accelerators offloading common algorithms such as AES and SHA-3. Increased clock gating and reworked microarchitecture at every stage, together with the fuse/prefix instructions enabling more work with fewer work units, and smarter cache with lower memory latencies and effective address tagging reducing cache misses, enables the POWER10 core consume half the power as POWER9. Combined with the improvements in the compute facilities by up to 30% makes the whole processor perform 2.6√ó better per watt than its predecessor. And in the case of mounting two cores on the same module, up to 3 times as fast in the same power budget. As the cores can act like eight logical processors the 15 core processor looks like 120 cores to the operating system. On a dual chip module, that becomes 240 simultaneous threads per socket. =I/O= The chips have completely reworked memory and I/O architectures. The Open Memory Interface (OMI) enables extremely low latency and high bandwidth RAM. Using serial memory communications to off chip controllers reduces signaling lanes to and from the chip, increases the bandwidth and makes the processor agnostic towards what technology is in the memory end, making the system flexible and future proofed. The RAM can be anything from DDR3 through DDR5 to GDDR and HBM or persistent storage memory, all depending on what's practical for the application. * DDR4 - Support for up to 4 TB RAM, 410 GB/s, 10 ns latency * GDDR6 - Up to 800 GB/s * Persistent storage - Up to 2 PB POWER10 enables encrypting of data with no performance penalty at every stage from RAM, across accelerators and cluster nodes to data at rest. POWER10 comes with PowerAXON facility enabling chip to chip, system to system and OpenCAPI bus for accelerators, I/O and other high performance cache coherent peripherals. It manages the communications between nodes in a 16x socket SCM cluster or a 4x socket DCM cluster. It also manages the memory semantics for clustering of systems enabling load/store access from the core up to 2 PB of RAM on the entire POWER10 cluster. IBM calls this feature Memory Inception. Both OMI and PowerAXON can handle 1 TB/s communications off the chip. Also in POWER10 is PCIe 5. The SCM has 32x and the DCM has 64x PCIe 5 lanes. IBM and Nvidia agreed that including NVLink in POWER10 would be somewhat redundant since PCIe 5 is fast enough for attaching many GPUs so it's not included. Support for NVLink on-chip was previously a unique selling point for POWER8 and POWER9. =Variants= The POWER10 will be available in two variants, defined by firmware in the packaging. Even though the chips are identical and the difference is set in firmware, it cannot be changed by the user nor IBM themselves. * 15√ó SMT8 cores * 30√ó SMT4 cores =Modules= The POWER10 comes in two flip-chip plastic land grid array (FC-PLGA) packages, one single chip module (SCM) and one dual chip module (DCM). * SCM ‚Äî 4+ GHz, up to 15 SMT8 cores.

Five examples flew with clubs and with private owners in contests and rallies. Design and development Until June 1928 Ren√©e Bult√© had been head of design with Ateliers de Construction A√©ronautique de Zeebruges, usually known as ZACCO and one of the pioneers of all-metal aircraft manufacture. He left them to found his own company, Avions Bult√© & Cie. Its first product, the RB.1 tandem seat training aircraft, flew towards the end of the year. The RB.1 was a simple, conventional, two-bay biplane with thin-section, equal span wings mounted without stagger. One feature of the design was the interchangeability of components; as an example, the wing panels were identical. Such interchangeability reduced the stocks of spares required. The lower wings were attached to the lower fuselage structure and the upper ones to a fuselage-wide centre section held well above the fuselage by four upright cabane struts from the upper fuselage. Both upper and lower wing-sets were mounted with 3¬∞ of dihedral and were braced together with two pairs of identical, parallel interplane struts on each side, assisted by the usual wire cross-bracing. Both had short, broad-chord ailerons which reached the wingtips and were externally interconnected. Structurally, each wing was built around two spruce spars and had plywood-covered leading edges. The trainer was powered by an Anzani 6 six-cylinder radial engine in the nose, fitted with a narrow-chord ring cowling. Immediately behind the engine the fuselage was five-sided, rectangular below but sloping on top, and was covered with aluminium sheets back to the wing leading edge. This region contained both fuel and oil tanks. Behind it, the fuselage was formed around four wooden longerons, ash to the rear of the cockpit and spruce further aft. The ash- framed part had three-ply covered sides and a thin aluminium underside and the rear fuselage was canvas covered, including domed rear decking. Normally the instructor and student sat one behind the other in a long, single, open cockpit, equipped with dual control. The front seat was under the wing but the rear one was behind the trailing edge, which had a rectangular cut-out for better upward vision. Alternatively, the seats could be arranged tightly side- by-side, though with slight stagger, which allowed single controls to be shared and eased communication. The RB.1's empennage was conventional, with a broad-chord, rectangular plan tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and carrying elevators with a large central cut-out for rudder movement. Its triangular fin mounted a parallelogram profile rudder which reached down to the keel. It had conventional, fixed landing gear, with its mainwheels on a single axle and a wide track of about . The axle was joined through rubber cord shock absorbers to a fixed pair of transverse steel tubes supported by a pair of steel V-struts mounted on the lower fuselage longerons. Its tailskid was externally mounted on a little steel tube pyramid, with a knee-type rubber cord shock absorber. Operational history The Bult√© RB.1 first flew towards the end of 1928, though the exact date is not known. Five appeared on the Belgian civil aircraft register between 1929 and 1931. One took part in the Tour du France des Avions de Tourisme around France in May 1931 and another in the Auvergne rally in July that year. In the UK sales efforts were handled by Sealandair but no examples were registered.

Legal career =Prosecutor and judge= Shih began his legal career at the Taichung District Prosecutors' Office in 1976. In 1982, he was named a judge of the Taichung District Court. After two years on the bench, Shih was appointed chief justice of the Taichung District Court. Upon stepping down from the Taichung District Court, Shih returned to the Taichung District Prosecutors' Office, where he served as chief prosecutor. Shih received the most votes in a January 2000 poll run by the Prosecutors' Reform Association. Subsequently, Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan named Shih chief prosecutor in Kaohsiung. The next year, Shih was tabbed to lead the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office. He remained in the position until 2004, when he was named Vice Minister of Justice under Chen in November. =Minister of Justice= It was widely speculated that Shih would be Chen's successor. Shih was then appointed in January 2005 by incoming premier Frank Hsieh, and took office on 1 February 2005 with the Hsieh cabinet. Shih retained his position after Su Tseng-chang and later Chang Chun-hsiung assumed the premiership. Throughout his tenure, Shih launched multiple investigations into electoral fraud. He also probed corruption, insider trading, and organized crime. Additionally, Shih promoted initiatives against drug offenses. Starting in 2006, Shih worked to implement a \\"conditional moratorium\\" on the death penalty, reducing executions of people on Taiwan's death row. Shortly after leaving his position as the Ministry of Justice in May 2008, Shih petitioned for retirement as a prosecutor, which would permit him to collect a higher pension. His successor Wang Ching-feng rejected the appeal. Later that year, Shih was charged with fraud in relation to his use of special allowance funds. In 2011, charges against Shih were dropped after the use of special allowance funds was officially decriminalized.

History The rum is named after Severo Arango y Ferro, nicknamed \\"El Dictador\\", who in the 1700s oversaw trade between Spain and the colonies. At the end of the 18th century Severo Arango y Ferro came to Cartagena de Indias in Nueva Granada (today's Colombia). He had plans to improve the tax collection system for Spain in the American Spanish colonies. His strong and powerful nature was quickly recognized and soon became DICTADOR. During his stay at Nueva Grenada he fell in love at first sight (and taste) - he discovered the rum there. His dedication and attachment to a tropical potion led him to become a key supplier of exotic sugarcane spirits, which at the time were the currency of the region. The company was founded by one of his descendants, Don Julio Arango y Parra, in 1913. Dictador rum master blender Hernan Parra Production The Dictador distillery is located in Cartagena de Indias on the Caribbean Sea in Colombia. The privileged position almost on the seafront creates a unique microclimate, ideal for rum aging, with an ambient temperature above 25 degrees, relative humidity above 85 percent per year. The proximity of the sea gives a distinctive taste of rum. Dictador rum is produced from sugar cane honey as opposed to molasses. In the rum production process, depending on its type, fermentation is subjected to so-called \\"Honey\\" - juice obtained from the first pressing of sugar cane. Later - in steel columns or copper alembics - distillation takes place. The distillate obtained in this way goes to oak barrels, in which it is aged. This is where the rum gets its final \\"cut\\" shaping its taste and bouquet. Due to restrictions imposed by the government to protect their own distilleries Dictador rum is not sold in 98% of Colombia. Less than 1% of its total production makes it to the Colombian market.

Placed on the site of an 8th century Saxon church also dedicated to St Peter, it was built in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, but was heavily restored and partially rebuilt in the 19th century. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance. Services for the parish continue and also cover the parishes of St Giles', Shermanbury and St. Peter's, Woodmancote, which form its united benefice. History The ground of the parish of Henfield is mostly composed of Weald clay, but towards the centre of the parish are low ridges of plateau gravel lying on Lower Greensand. On one of these, near the old road that ran from Eatons, near Ashurst, to Hurstpierpoint, stands the church of St Peter, rather to the north-west of most of the village‚Äôs older buildings. The first St. Peter's Church, probably built on the same spot, was founded by thegn Waerbald and his wife Tidburg, to whom Osmund, king of Sussex, granted 15 hides of land for that purpose in the year 770. It has been suggested that this church was a minster, i.e. that it held a community of clergymen, but this remains a disputed point. The 15 hides granted by Osmund can presumably be identified with the lands which appear after the Conquest as Stretham (or Henfield) manor, Oreham manor, Henfield park, and the rectory estate. The early history of Stretham manor, consisting of the church itself and most of the southern and central parts of Henfield parish along with outlying parts in neighbouring parishes, shows the close connection between St Peter's, Henfield and its bishops. By 1066 Stretham manor was the property of the bishopric of Selsey, and in 1086 Domesday Book records it as belonging to the bishopric of Chichester (to which the see had been moved in 1075). The bishops of Chichester kept a house on this estate which in the later middle ages served as Henfield's main courthouse. A farmhouse comprising one wing of the original house still survives under the name Stretham Manor. A vicarage was ordained in 1219, by which date the rectory had become a prebend of Chichester Cathedral, further strengthening the links between St Peter's and its see. The Saxon church survived at least as late as Domesday Book, but nothing now remains of it. Perhaps around 1200‚Äì1220, and certainly no later than 1250, it had been replaced by a simple nave and chancel built of Caen stone, a kind of Middle Jurassic limestone quarried in Normandy. The chancel arch from this building can still be seen, as can two lancet windows in what is now the vestry. Two aisles to north and south were built later in the 13th century, and in the 14th century the porch and the arches separating the nave from the aisles were added. There was much further building in the 15th century: the tower, a westward extension of the nave, and north of the chancel a new chapel, known as the Parham chapel. This last may have been the work of Thomas Beckington, Prebendary of Henfield from 1438 to 1443. In 1530 the dedication of the church, which is usually given as being to St Peter, was recorded as being to Sts Peter and Paul. In 1627 two dormer windows were added to the north aisle; those in the south aisle are of uncertain date but may be from the same period. A gallery on the south side of the church is recorded as being in place in 1718. St Peter's and one of its churchwardens featured in a court case in 1607 involving the theft of a bell from St Leonard's Church, Aldrington, a parish church a few miles away. Aldrington parish was then depopulated and the church was ruinous, and arrangements were made to sell its bell. Although this arrived at St Peter's, \\"it did not travel to Henfield with the consent of the Aldrington parishioners\\": the churchwarden admitted helping to steal it, and \\"the authorities at Henfield Church admitted that they had received of bell material\\" which was used to cast a new bell for the tower. They agreed to pay compensation of ¬£16.5s. to Aldrington parish. The 19th century saw extensive rebuilding of the fabric of the church. First of all the south aisle, which had been said to be badly out of repair as early as 1637, was replaced before 1833 at the expense of the notable botanist William Borrer, a local resident, and a gallery was included for the use of schoolchildren. In 1855 the tower was restored by an unknown architect. In 1870 and 1871 a large-scale restoration was undertaken to the designs of the architects William Slater and Richard Carpenter. Most of the walls were refaced with flint, the chancel was lengthened eastward and raised in height, a new south chancel chapel was built, both aisles were entirely rebuilt, the roof of the nave was opened up and new clerestory lancet windows installed. St Peter's Church was designated a Grade II* listed building on 15 March 1955. Such buildings are defined as being \\"particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest\\". In February 2001, it was one of 54 Grade II* listed buildings, and 1,028 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Mid Sussex. In 2008 a new stone floor was laid, under-floor heating installed, and the 19th-century pews were replaced with chairs. Related buildings Seen from the north-east The prebend is recorded in 1341 as consisting of a house and garden with 60 acres of land. About 1520 it became the property of the diocese, but a few years later in 1533 it was leased for 80 years to Thomas Bishop, lawyer to Bishop Robert Sherburne. From him the lease passed first to his son Sir Thomas Bishop, then to the second Thomas's younger son Henry Bishop, Postmaster General of England, who was temporarily deprived of it during the Commonwealth period. Parsonage House, the successor of the original prebend house, was built in the 16th century or earlier but was refronted in the 18th century; it still stands in Church Street. A vicarage house appears in documents of 1481, 1529, 1636 and 1724, but the present vicarage was built c. 1806 and enlarged c. 1850. In 1812 a church school for boys was opened in Henfield. Its successor, St Peter's Church of England Primary School, occupies buildings on the north-west edge of the village which were built in 1957 and extended in 1983. An iron mission room capable of seating 60 was built on Oreham Common in 1891, but, services there being very badly attended, it was demolished before 1909. Architecture and fittings The church tower and some of the churchyard's 104 clipped yews The church of St Peter as it stands today consists of a nave with north and south aisles and transepts, a chancel flanked by a chapel to the north and a vestry to the south, a porch and a tower. The nave dates from the 13th century, though whether early or late is disputed. The chancel arch, though 13th century, was rebuilt in the 19th. The aisles and chancel are products of the 1870‚Äì1871 restoration. The 15th-century Parham chapel is remarkable for its east window, a lovely example of the Gothic style of Henry VI's reign. The tower is in a rather austere version of the Perpendicular style, \\"as grim\\", Pevsner says, \\"as it would be in Northumberland\\". During the restoration work of 1870‚Äì1871 some murals were uncovered, the most interesting of which, found on the church's north wall, was on a heraldic subject. Medieval murals are quite common in Sussex churches, but this one was dated as late as 1694. There was also formerly a painting of the Decalogue, Creed and Lord's Prayer with cherubs and angels, dating from 1897, which hung in the Parham chapel until the 1950s. The church's notable fittings include an octagonal font, dated variously to the early 13th century or to the 15th century, a 14th-century iron-bound chest, and, in the Parham chapel, a reredos carved by Frank Ernest Howard with figures of the patron saints of the four countries of the United Kingdom. The chapel screen, in the arch between the Parham chapel and the north aisle, was executed by Frances E. Allen in 1969, but it incorporates 15th-century work. There are eight 18th-century bells, said to give \\"one of the best rings in the county\\". The plate is of a similar date, consisting of a salver (1704), flagon (1732), chalice (1733), and two patens and an almsdish (1753). The modern kneelers illustrate in tapestry the animal and plant life of Henfield parish in almost 300 different designs. There are two brasses. One, in the vestry, shows Ann Kenwellmersh (d. 1633) with her hand on the head of her nine-year- old grandson Menelab Rainsford (d. 1627). The other, in the Parham chapel, is of Thomas Bishop (d. 1559), the first of the family to lease the rectory. Also in the Parham chapel is a monument to Thomas's grandson Henry Bishop, the Postmaster General. Two memorial tablets inside the church, on the right as you walk through the door from the porch, name the 60 men of the parish who died in the First World War, and the 14 who died in the Second World War. Stained glass The Mary Magdalene window St Peter's Church is notable for the quality of its stained glass, which includes work by some of the best- known designers in late 19th-century and early 20th-century England. In the north aisle the second window, depicting Fortitude and Charity, was produced c. 1907 by the firm of James Powell and Sons, and the first window (St Luke and St Paul) was designed by the Sussex artist Charles Eamer Kempe in 1903. The north transept's north window was made in 1928 by Kempe and Co after Kempe's death; its east window (Madonna and Child, and St Nicholas with children) by Frederick Charles Eden, a Brighton man, in 1935. In the Parham chapel, the north window is full of local interest, its five lights depicting Lancelot Andrewes, St Richard of Chichester, St Peter (the dedicatee of the church), St Wilfrid (whom Gibbon called the Apostle of Sussex), and St Augustine of Canterbury. It was produced by Kempe and Co in 1920. The chapel's east window, in four lights, is a 1921 work by Geoffrey Fuller Webb. It shows the Captain of the Host of the Lord appearing to Joshua before Jericho (Joshua 5:13‚Äì15), and St John the Divine writing about the Holy City. Between the chapel and the chancel are glass windows engraved with agricultural scenes, which were installed in 1969. The five-light east window of the chancel was designed by Kempe in 1874 or 1875, and shows a Nativity scene, the Crucifixion, and several saints. In the vestry, which is kept locked, is a striking, quasi-Art Nouveau depiction of Mary Magdalene over the text \\"She hath done what she could\\" (Mark 14:8). It was produced by Lowndes and Drury, with the design attributed by one authority to Mary Lowndes, by another to Isobel Lilian Gloag. According to the art historian Peter Cormack it was designed by Gloag and painted by Lowndes. An adjoining office, also locked, has the oldest stained glass in the church, a depiction of Jesus preaching the Sermon on the Mount installed in 1872. Its style suggests it is the work of Clayton and Bell. The three-light south transept window (St Oswald, St George and St Edmund) is by Kempe and Co, 1916. The south aisle's first window by Charles Eamer Kempe, 1898, shows the Annunciation. The second window, designed by Mary Lowndes and produced by James Powell and Sons in 1891, is on the theme \\"Suffer the little children to come unto me\\" (Mark 10:14). Finally the west window, which is not accessible to the public, depicts St Michael, St George and St Raphael. It was made in 1896 and is once again the work of Charles Eamer Kempe. Today Since 1978 St Peter's, Henfield has formed part of the united benefice of Henfield with Shermanbury and Woodmancote, but it remains a distinct parish. The parish is served by a vicar, an assistant priest and an assistant curate. Holy Communion is celebrated on Sunday at 10.00 a.m., sometimes with the Book of Common Prayer liturgy and sometimes with Common Worship, except on the first Sunday of every month when there is a family- friendly service without Communion. There are also sometimes services earlier on Sunday morning, and at 6.30 on Sunday evening. Holy Communion is celebrated on Wednesday at 10.30 a.m. and on Thursday at 7.15 p.m., and services are regularly conducted in two local care homes. The church is open to visitors every day from 8.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. See also * * Grade II* listed buildings in West Sussex * List of places of worship in Horsham District Notes References     Category:13th-century church buildings in England Henfield Henfield Henfield Saint Peter's Church, Henfield ","title":"St Peter's Church, Henfield"},{"id":"54882492","text":"In 1303, the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji captured the Chittor Fort from the Guhila king Ratnasimha, after an eight month long siege. The conflict has been described in several legendary accounts, including the historic epic poem Padmavat, which claims that Alauddin's motive was to obtain Ratnasimha's beautiful wife Padmavati.  Background  The Mewar region in north-western India was ruled by the Guhila dynasty, whose seat was located at the Chittor Fort (Chittorgarh). In 1299, Alauddin's general Ulugh Khan had raided the Mewar region on his way to Gujarat. However, this appears to have been a light raid rather than a serious invasion, and the Guhila king Samarasimha protected his country from the raiders, possibly by paying a tribute. In 1301, Alauddin conquered Ranthambore, which was located between Delhi and Chittor, and then returned to Delhi. The same year, Ratnasimha ascended the throne of Chittor. The later legends based on Malik Mohammad Jaisi's epic poem Padmavat state that Alauddin invaded Chittor to obtain Padmini, the queen of Ratnasimha (called Ratan Sen or Ratan Singh in these legends). According to these legends, a man named Raghava told Alauddin about the extraordinary beauty of Padmini. However, Padmini does not find a mention in the earliest records of Alauddin's conquest of Chittor, such as the chronicles by Amir Khusrau, Barani and Isami. Most modern historians have rejected the authenticity of the Padmini legend.  The siege  Chittor Fort in 2011 On 28 January 1303, Alauddin started his march to Chittor with a large army. After arriving near the fort, he set up a camp between the Berach and Gambhiri rivers. His army then surrounded the fort from all the sides. Alauddin stationed himself at Chitori hillock located to the north of the fort. The siege went on for nearly 8 months, which suggests that the defenders put up a strong resistance. Amir Khusrau, who accompanied Alauddin to Chittor, has described the siege in brief, in his Khaza'in ul-Futuh. However, no detailed account of the siege operations is available. Khusrau implies that the frontal attacks by the invaders failed twice. He states that during the two months of the rainy season, the invaders managed to reach the \\"waist\\" of the hill, but could not advance further. Alauddin ordered the fort to be pelted with stones from siege engines (munjaniqs), while his armoured soldiers attacked it from all sides. The fort garrison may have suffered from a famine or an epidemic. On 26 August 1303, Alauddin entered the fort. After his victory, Alauddin ordered a general massacre of Chittor's population. According to Amir Khusrau, 30,000 Hindus were \\"cut down like dry grass\\" as a result of this order. = Fate of Ratnasimha = Accounts vary about what happened to Ratnasimha, the ruler of Chittor. The early Muslim chroniclers such as Amir Khusrau, Ziauddin Barani and Isami, state that the unnamed ruler (\\"Rai\\") of Chittor surrendered to Alauddin, and was pardoned. The Jain writer Kakka Suri (1336) states that Alauddin took away his wealth, and \\"made him move like a monkey from one city to another\\". The Kumbhalgarh prashasti (eulogistic inscription) of 1460 CE, which is the earliest Hindu record of the siege, states that Ratnasimha \\"departed\\" from the battlefield, after which Lakshmasimha died defending the fort because only the cowards forsake \\"the established traditions of the family\\", while \\"those who are valorous and steady do not give up their pursuit.\\" Modern historians have interpreted the word \\"departed\\" (tasmin gate in Sanskrit) variously, either to mean that Ratnasimha died fighting on the battlefield, or to mean that he deserted the defenders and surrendered. The Padmavat legend claims that Ratnasimha (\\"Ratan Sen\\") died in a combat with the ruler of Kumbhalner, before Alauddin's conquest of the fort. The 17th century chronicler Muhnot Nainsi, who wrote under Rajput patronage, states that Ratnasimha died on the battlefield. = Jauhar = The 16th century legendary poem Padmavat states that Ratnasimha's queen Padmini and other women committed suicide by jauhar (mass self-immolation) to avoid being captured by Alauddin. This claim is also repeated in several later texts. Historian Kishori Saran Lal dismisses the Padmavat as a non-historical text, but believes that a jauhar did happen at Chittor following Alauddin's conquest. On the other hand, Banarsi Prasad Saksena notes that contemporary writer Amir Khusrau does not mention any jauhar at Chittor, although he has referred to the jauhar during the earlier conquest of Ranthambore. Therefore, Saksena believes that the story of jauhar at Chittor is a fabrication of the later writers.  Aftermath  Alauddin assigned Chittor to his son Khizr Khan (or Khidr Khan), who was 7 or 8 years old at the time. The Chittor fort was renamed \\"Khizrabad\\" after the prince. Khizr Khan was given a gold-embroidered robe and a red canopy, which was usually bestowed upon an heir apparent. Alauddin stayed at Chittor for 7 more days, and then left for Delhi, probably after learning about the Mongol invasion. An important inscription at Chittor dated 13 May 1310, recording Alauddin as the ruler, indicates that the place had not been evacuated by the Khaljis till that period. As Khizr Khan was only a child, the actual administration was handed over to a slave named Malik Shahin, who held the office of naib-i barbek, and whom Alauddin called his son. According to the 14th century chronicler Isami, Malik Shahin fled the fort sometime later, because he was afraid of the Vaghela king Karna, who had managed to recapture the neighbouring Gujarat region after Alauddin's 1299 invasion. Later, Alauddin seems to have decided that it was best to govern Chittor indirectly through a Hindu ruler. He transferred the governance of Chittor from Khizr Khan to the Chahamana chief Maladeva (Maldeo), who was supported by the locals. Maladeva was a brother of the Kanhadadeva, and had saved Alauddin's life from an accident during Alauddin's siege of Kanhadadeva's Jalore fort. He contributed 5,000 horsemen and 10,000 infantrymen to Alauddin's campaigns, whenever ordered. He used to bring gifts for Alauddin during his annual visit to the imperial court, where he was honoured in return. Alauddin maintained an imperial garrison at Chittor, and one of his inscriptions (dated May 1310) has been discovered there. According to the 16th century chronicler Firishta, when Alauddin was at his deathbed, the ruler of Chittor rebelled, and executed the imperial soldiers stationed in the fort. After the death of Maladeva around 1321, the fort came under the control of Hammir Singh, a ruler of the Sisodia branch of the Guhilas. However, historian Peter Jackson believes that the fort remained under the control of the governors dispatched from Delhi, even during the reigns of the first two Tughluq rulers (1321-1350), as suggested by epigraphic evidence. According to Jackson, the accounts about Maladeva and Sisodias originated from a Sanskrit epic, and seem to be inaccurate.
