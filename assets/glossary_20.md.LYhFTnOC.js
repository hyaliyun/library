The castle began as a small fortification in to control access to the island, before it was expanded to become a walled town and the island's capital by the early 15th century. The Ottoman Empire took possession in 1479, and a century later rebuilt and enlarged it, giving it largely its present shape. A sizeable town grew outside the castle walls by the 1670s. The fortress was captured by the Republic of Venice in 1684 after a brief siege. Under the Venetians, the castle was converted into a purely military installation; the walled town and the outskirts adjoining the walls were razed to improve its defences, and the capital moved onto the island itself, at the site of the present city of Lefkada. The fortress was modernized in the early 18th century, but was briefly abandoned by the overstretched Venetians in 1715‚Äì1716, during the Republic's last war with the Ottomans. The fortress, like the island, changed hands between France, the Russians, the Septinsular Republic, and the French again in 1797‚Äì1810, before being captured by the British, who controlled it until the cession of the Ionian Islands to Greece in 1864. History =Middle Ages= Located on a long and narrow spit projecting towards the nearby mainland coast of Epirus, the castle is strategically situated to guard the approaches to the island from the mainland. The first castle was probably erected at this location around 1300 by John I Orsini, the Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, who received possession of Lefkada (then known as Santa Maura) in 1295 from his father-in-law, the Despot of Epirus Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas. This first fortification was probably in the northeastern corner of the current castle. The Orsini family lost Lefkada in 1331 to Walter VI of Brienne, who in 1343 ceded the castrum Sancte Maure and the island to the Venetian Graziano Giorgio. In 1360/62, Leonardo I Tocco seized Lefkada, assuming the title of duke. Carlo I Tocco () made the castle the capital of his domains, which apart from the County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos also included much of the Epirote mainland, and enlarged the fortified town. Nevertheless, the settlement appears to have extended beyond the walls on both sides of the castle. In 1413, the Prince of Achaea, Centurione II Zaccaria, launched an attack on Lefkada and its castle with Albanian mercenaries, but it was defeated with help from the Republic of Venice. The Ottomans raided the island in 1430, leading the Tocci to consider ceding it to the Venetians, but in the event the island remained under Tocco rule until captured by the Ottomans in 1479. =Ottoman period= The Venetians briefly occupied the island in 1502‚Äì03, during the Second Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War, but returned it to the Ottomans in the final peace settlement. Under Ottoman rule, the town inside the castle (known as Aya Mavra (, from Greek ) was the capital of the island. A register compiled in 1523‚Äì1536 mentions that the town comprised 194 households, i.e., around 1,000 inhabitants, all of them Greek Christians, and that the garrison numbered 111 soldiers and 9 artillerymen. A lack of water led to the construction of a long aqueduct from the island's interior to the town in 1564. Bringing water to the walled town as well as to the much larger‚Äîsome 700‚Äì800 houses‚Äîopen town that had grown around it, this was of the most important works of Ottoman civil architecture in the western Balkans. On top of the aqueduct was a footpath that was the only access to the island, other than by the sea. In the aftermath of the Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Lepanto, the castle was unsuccessfully besieged by the forces of the Holy League. As a result, it was completely rebuilt and enlarged by the Kapudan Pasha Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha in 1572‚Äì1574. The new castle resembles the earlier Castle of the Morea at Rio. The new fortress was in the shape of an irregular hexagon, some to at its widest; and featured nine large round cannon bastions. The medieval fortress was retained as a citadel on the northeastern corner. By the time Evliya √áelebi visited the castle in 1670/71, only Muslims lived in its stone houses, with the Christians in two adjoining suburbs to the east and west and one on the island itself. In contrast to the walled town, all buildings in the suburbs had purposely been built of wood. Evliya writes that the garrison comprised 1,085 men, but an Ottoman budget document from the same year lists just 285. =Venetian period= The castle was conquered by the Venetians following a sixteen-day siege in 1684, during the Morean War. The Venetian commander, Francesco Morosini, evacuated the walled town and demolished both it and the two suburbs directly outside the walls, turning them into the castle's glacis. The island's capital moved to the remaining suburb, at the site of the modern city of Lefkada. The Venetians modernized the castle by 1713, removing the remains of the medieval citadel; the eastern ramparts, facing the Ottoman-held mainland, were thickened and improved with the addition of two bastions, a ravelin and couvreface; and additional outworks were built on the flanks of the fortress. During the Seventh Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War, following the rapid Ottoman reconquest of the Morea in 1715, the Venetians initially abandoned Lefkada to focus their resources on the defence of Corfu. The castle was abandoned and partly demolished, but after the Siege of Corfu ended in a Venetian victory, the island was reoccupied and the fortifications restored. After a rebellion of the local Greek rebellion in 1769, the fortifications were repaired. =Modern period= The eastern (mainland-oriented) moat of the castle today (2014), with the ruined piers of the wooden access bridge visible Following the Fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, Lefkada, like the other Venetian Ionian Islands, was occupied by the French, who held it until a Russo-Turkish expedition under Ushakov captured it in 1799. Ali Pasha of Ioannina, who coveted possession of the Ionian Islands, besieged Lefkada in 1807, but the local Russian and Greek forces of the Septinsular Republic successfully defended the fortress. French rule was restored in 1807, after the Treaty of Tilsit, but in 1810, the British captured the island. During the subsequent period of the British protectorate, the castle was garrisoned by British troops, who undertook some modernization of its facilities. Following the Union of the Ionian Islands with Greece in 1864, the castle was garrisoned by the Greek army until 1922, when Asia Minor refugees were housed there. The fortress was eventually abandoned, and in 1938 most of the buildings with its walls were demolished.

Events include their version of the Wigstock drag queen festival, a bear fest, athletic events, and an art festival. It is one of the country's largest LGBTQ events. Since its start in 2000 it has grown to be a significant event for the town culminating in the grand finale of Pink Loerie, Knysna Pride parade and its 1000-person after-party held on the final weekend with floats, performers, and DJs. The Knysna loerie is a green bird but the color pink has a long association with LGBTQ culture. Pink Loerie has traditionally been held in late April/ early May but in 2018 was moved to late May. 2020's festivities were cancelled due to the Covid-2019 coronavirus pandemic. It was announced that the Mr Gay World, and Mr Gay All Stars events will be held in conjunction with the 2021 Pink Loerie, with events in both Knysna and Port Elizabeth.  Background  A pair of Knysna turacos or loeries for which the event is named. According to Sowetan Live Magazine, the Knysna township is \\"a destination of expansive lagoons and indigenous forests surrounded by the Outeniqua Mountain range in the heart of the popular Garden Route\\". The local economy is geared towards tourism, including ecotourism, and the area's main local specialty oysters. Pink Loerie was started by local businessmen to entice tourists to the town during the traditionally slow month of May to reinvigorate the economy. South Africa has \\"arguably the most liberal constitution for LGBTQI people\\" but still has to overcome homophobia and the reticence of LGBTQ people to visit. According to Pink Loerie and other groups homophobia and anti-LGBTQ attitudes were introduced to the African continent through colonialism. Same-sex relationships were quite common in Africa prior to colonialism. The Human Rights Watch (HRW) says that anti-gay stigmas often come from colonial-era laws in Africa (1870s-1900). LGBTQ tourism is estimated to be worth over $200 billion a year as of 2019. The Knysna loerie is a green bird but the color pink has a long association with LGBTQ culture. History  The Pink Loerie Mardi Gras and Arts Festival is an annual LGBTQ Pride carnival event and parade held in Knysna, a coastal township in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Since its start in 2000 it has grown to be a significant event for the town culminating in the Knysna Pride parade or Madrid Gras. Pink Loerie was first celebrated in May 2001, and was \\"groundbreaking\\" in the country for the way organisers worked \\"with the town of Knysna to put on the annual LGBTQ arts and culture festival\\". During early years organisers envisioned an event that would emulate Pride events celebrating diversity, the next evolution was to host a parade akin to that of the famous Sydney Mardi Gras. Juan Lerm-Hoffman, one of the co-founders who also co-founded Mr Gay South Africa, wrote: \\"Pink Loerie Mardi Gras was born to benefit the town of Knysna, to create a platform for the entire LGBTI community to celebrate their culture and all the diversities within and to raise money for various charities and last but not least to use the Mardi Gras as a ‚Äòtool‚Äô to educate the masses on the gay community and gay culture, on the difficulties within this culture and to promote tolerance and understanding.\\" Lerm-Hoffman, who grew up in the Eastern Cape province, ran Pink Loerie until new organizers took over in 2009. In 2003 Pink Loerie estimated 3,000 visitors. In 2005, an estimated estimated that 10,000 people watched the parade, and 3,000 to 4,000 visitors spent the weekend in the township. In 2007 attendance was estimated at 8,000 to 10,000 people. Pink Loerie organizes fundraising like a VIP dinner, and silent auction, for charities like old-age homes, animal welfare and others raising thousands of Rands. The grand finale of Pink Loerie is Knysna Pride parade and its 1000-person after-party held on the final weekend with floats, performers, and DJs. International attention focused on Knysna when Mr Gay World 2015, and Mr Gay World 2018 were both held as part of Pink Loerie. Mr Gay World and Pink Loerie will again coincide in the township in 2021. In 2016 Africa's first mass same-sex wedding took place when sixteen couples wed at Pink Loerie. Events include their version of the Wigstock drag queen festival, a bear fest, athletic events, and an art festival. During the 2017 Knysna Fires‚Äîwhere seven people were killed and over 1000 homes were burned down‚ÄîPink Loerie and the Pink Loerie Foundation raised funds and procured relief items for families in distress. The 2018 Pink Loerie was a benefit for the recovery effort. The Pink Loerie Foundation received the Community Outreach Award during the annual 92.2 FM Eastwave Radio Nelson Mandela International Day Community Leadership Awards for their contribution and work during the 2017 Knysna Fires in the Greater Knysna area. The 2018 theme was Sequins and Mascara. Pink Loerie has traditionally been held in late April/early May but in 2018 was moved to late May. 2019's event was postponed due to a shortage of pre-event sponsors. It was restructured in hopes future events would grow even larger. 2020's festivities were cancelled due to the Covid-2019 coronavirus pandemic. It was announced that the Mr Gay World, and Mr Gay All Stars events will be held in conjunction with the 2021 Pink Loerie, with events in both Knysna and Port Elizabeth. It is one of the country's largest LGBTQ events; in 2016 they had 25,000-30,000 people. As of May 2020, John-Louis O‚ÄôNeil is the Pink Loerie organizer. Expressions of us.JPG Expressive in pink.JPG Fun under a pink sun.JPG Pink beauty.JPG Pink bubbles.JPG Pink contemplation.JPG Pink peep.JPG  Pink Loerie Magazine  To secure funds in partnerships sponsors will often pay for ads in what has become Pink Loerie Magazine (PLM). What started as a small one color guide booklet in 2010, evolved to a full color newspaper by 2012, and eventually to a registered glossy full color magazine. The event has traditionally raised as much sponsorships as possible including support from Knysna Tourism, and the Town Council. After expenses have been paid the remaining thousands is split between the named charities. In 2014, R22,450 () was raised for three charities: R5000 to the Knysna Animal Welfare Society, R9450 to the Loeriehof old age home, and R8000 to the Knysna Mayor's Social Relief Fund.

He was sworn in as a Member of the National Assembly on 21 May 2014 and was assigned to the Portfolio Committee on Rural Development and Land Reform in June 2014. At the EFF's leadership conference in December 2014, Mngitxama declined the nomination to serve on the party's Central Command Team. He then became disgruntled with the party's new leadership. In February 2015, he accused the party leader Julius Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu of making a deal with the African National Congress to get rid of seven EFF MPs. On 13 April, Mngxitama was expelled from the EFF and lost his parliamentary membership in accordance to the terms of section 47(3)(c) of the Constitution. In October of the same year, he formed the Black First Land First party. The party pondered contesting the 2016 municipal elections, but went on to not contest it. The party did contest the May 2019 general election and won no representation in parliament or in the nine provincial legislatures. In July, the IEC announced the annulment of the party's registration, following an appeal by the Freedom Front Plus. The party appealed the judgement but it was upheld in November.

Unveiled in 1914, the statue had its right arm broken off in 2008 and has subsequently been dubbed Venus de Hokitika. The memorial was relocated in 2016 from its original location on the side of State Highway 6 to the centre of a roundabout in one of Hokitika's main streets. Description The memorial's height is . It has a square pedestal with a marble statue on top. The pedestal has four plaques that read the following: #1864‚Äì1914. In honour of the Pioneers of Westland, 'The Frontier Line.' #Where the Vanguard Camps To-day the Rear Shall Rest To-morrow. #Fortune's Buffets and Rewards, Ta'en with Equal Thanks. #Daring and Conquering ‚Äì Though not Sharing in the After-Glow. A sub-base was constructed of concrete. Square bases of granite placed on the concrete gave the structure supporting the pedestal a height of . The granite pedestal is framed by four columns made of Labrador granite. A capping stone in dormer style supports the marble statue, the figure of a miner. The miner's left hand rests on a pickaxe. History The vandalised memorial in its original location in 2015 The purpose of the memorial is to commemorate the early pioneers of Westland. The term Westland refers to the West Coast and stems from the time of provincial New Zealand when the area was known as the Westland Province. A committee had formed to organise a statue and fundraise its costs. The chairman of the organising committee was Thomas Wanless Bruce, who at the time was the mayor of Ross. A pound-for-pound grant was sought from the government and Francis Bell in his role as Minister of Internal Affairs approved a grant up to NZ¬£200. The intention was to erect the memorial for the 50th jubilee of Westland but the festivities were held in January 1914. The memorial had been ordered by December 1913. The memorial was unveiled on 8 July 1914 in front of a large crowd. The honour of unveiling fell on Mrs Perry, the Hokitika mayoress. Speeches were then given by mayors of surrounding boroughs (Greymouth, Ross, Kumara), chairmen of surrounding counties (Inangahua County and Westland County), Henry Michel as chairman of the Hokitika Harbour Board, one of the pioneers and the secretary of the memorial committee. The prime minister, members of the cabinet, the leader of the opposition, and members from the West Coast all put in their apologies. The 1914 parliamentary session had just started (on 25 June) and their absence was thus unavoidable. After the singing of the national anthem, God Save the Queen, the memorial was formally handed over to the Hokitika Borough. In the 1989 local government reforms, Hokitika Borough was subsumed by Westland District and ownership of the memorial thus went to the district council. In January 2009, the memorial was vandalised and the statue's right arm was broken off. Subsequently, the memorial was dubbed Venus de Hokitika in reference to the armless statue Venus de Milo. The council took the left arm and the pickaxe into storage but the right hand had gone missing in the vandalism. =Renovation and relocation= Jacqui Grant, the person behind the relocation The Memorial Committee had originally asked for the memorial to be placed in the centre of the intersection of Fitzherbert and Stafford streets. At the time, those streets were the main roads connecting to outlying locations and the streets formed a cross intersection; the leg across the Ross Branch railway line has since been closed. On 24 October 1913, the committee appeared as a deputation in front of the Hokitika Borough Council and formally put the request to them, based on the precedent formed by the Hokitika Clock Tower that had been unveiled in 1903 in the centre of a nearby intersection. Whilst it was stressed that the chosen intersection was more spacious and the based of the memorial was just half the diameter of the clock tower, the council refused the request on concerns that the intersection would become congested. The committee recorded its regret and a further deputation requested on 5 December that the borough council purchase a reserve from the Railway Department of at the corner of the same intersection. This request was accepted by the elected members. The committee also foreshadowed that they intended for the borough council to take on the memorial. In 2012, when a committee worked on preparations for the 2014 sesquicentennial of the town, the idea was mooted to relocate the memorial to outside the Hokitika Museum. District councillor Jacquie Grant disagreed with the proposed location on the grounds that it is \\"out of the way\\" and obtained community support to have the memorial relocated to the intersection of Tancred and Weld streets. Grant also fundraised the amount needed to relocate the memorial so that it did not come as a cost to Westland District Council. The anniversary committee subsequently withdrew their relocation proposal. The Westland Pioneers' Memorial was removed from its original site in early 2016, cleaned, and had the right arm and the pick axe replaced. Later in the same year, the memorial was placed in the roundabout at Tancred and Weld streets. It is thus in the same street as the town's most prominent landmark‚Äîthe Hokitika Clock Tower‚Äîone block closer to the sea.

Early life and education  Angela Haseltine Pozzi was born in Portland, Oregon, in 1957. Pozzi was born into an artistic family and spent much of her early life on the shores of the Oregon coast. She attended the University of Utah earning a bachelor's degree in education in 1984. In 1990, she received her Master's in Education from Portland State University, with an emphasis in Art Education.  Career  Pozzi was a teacher for 30 years. After the sudden death of her husband in 2002 she turned to the ocean for healing. After seeing the detriment of plastic pollution along the Oregon coast, she soon realized the ocean also needed healing. She researched the impact of plastic on marine life and in 2012 she founded the Washed Ashore Project. With plastic debris collected from the beaches bordering Bandon, Oregon, she constructs large sculptures of marine life. With the help of over 10,000 volunteers the organization has collected upwards of 40,000 pounds of waste and created 70 sculptures.  Style  Pozzi creates colorful sculptures from everyday waste items such as bottles and bags. Her large-scale sculptures include a polar bear, puffin, jellyfish, and an octopus. She personifies her sculptures by giving them human names, for example her sculpture titled Edward the Leatherback Sea Turtle. Pozzi uses her work to educate the viewer on conservation and tries to engage them to think about the impacts of plastic use on marine environments.

The painting showcases Momper's large scale, imaginary landscape painting and his interpretation of perspective in distant views while at the same time treating a biblical subject. The painting depicts the story of Tobit, a righteous Israelite of the tribe of Naphtali, living in Nineveh, who is sent to recover is father's money to Media, escorted by the Archangel Raphael. The painting is currently housed at the Rockox House in Antwerp. Subject Tobit's son Tobiah is sent by his father to collect money that he has deposited in Media. Raphael presents himself as Tobit's kinsman, Azariah, and offers to aid and protect Tobias. Under Raphael's guidance, Tobias journeys to Media with his dog. Along the way, while washing his feet in the river Tigris, a fish tries to swallow his foot. By the angel's order, Tobias captures the fish and removes its heart, liver and gall bladder. Upon their arrival in Media, Raphael tells Tobias of the beautiful Sarah, who is plagued by Asmodeus, the daemon of lust. Tobias has the right to marry her because she is his cousin and he her closest relative. The angel instructs the young man to burn the fish's liver and heart to drive away the demon when he attacks on the wedding night. Tobias and Sarah marry, and the fumes of the burning organs drive the daemon to Upper Egypt, where Raphael follows and binds him. Sarah's father had been digging a grave to bury Tobias under the assumption that he would be killed, as the daemon had killed every man Sarah married on their wedding night before the marriages could be consummated. Surprised to find his son-in-law alive and well, Sarah's father orders a double-length wedding feast and has the grave secretly filled. Since the feast prevents him from leaving, Tobias sends Raphael to recover his father's money. After the feast, Tobias and Sarah return to Nineveh. There, Raphael tells the youth to use the fish's gall to cure his father's blindness. Raphael then reveals his identity and returns to heaven, while Tobit sings a hymn of praise. Painting Momper owed much to Pieter Bruegel the Elder, as evinced in this painting. Although he journeyed to Italy, de Momepr chose to follow the example of Brueghel, later becoming part of the more imaginative of two groups of landscapists whose style stemmed from Brueghel's oeuvre. De Momper is considered to have made a great contribution to the development of landscape painting in the period between Brueghel and the generation of Rubens. The Flemish landscapists didn't paint en plain air; they relied solely on their memory and imagination to produce fantastic and exotic landscape painting in a relatively flat land such as Flanders. In the painting, a cliff stands to the left, from whence a path descends into the valley underneath. The path crosses a bridge, overhanging a river flowing into the valley. Gabriel, Tobias and his dog stand close to each other in the foreground, by a curve in the path leading into the dale. Momper was a frequent collaborator of Jan Brueghel the Elder, and he often left the staffage of his painting to fellow artists. Tobias' Journey is likely one of such cases.

In 1942, she led a strike of bank employees in Montreal, the first strike in the Canadian banking industry. She later led a drive to unionize employees at Eaton‚Äôs and helped organize 9,000 Eaton's employees between 1948 and 1952. While the attempt was unsuccessful, the pressure led Eaton‚Äôs to increase employee salaries and benefits. In 1979, Sufrin was one of seven women awarded the Governor General‚Äôs Medal, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Persons Case. Early life Sufrin was born in Montreal in 1913 and raised in Toronto. Her father was a travelling salesman for a men's clothing company and her mother had been a dressmaker before marrying. After graduating head of her class at Vaughan Road Collegiate, she completed a diploma in stenography and bookkeeping. She worked as a teacher and, later, an office worker. Labour activism In the 1930s, Sufrin became involved in the Co-operative Commonwealth Youth Movement (CCYM), the youth wing of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the precursor to the New Democratic Party (NDP). Sufrin was active in the Ontario CCYM throughout the 1930s and, when the CCF established a trade union committee in 1937, she was named secretary. =Banque Canadienne Nationale strike= In 1941, the newly-formed Canadian Congress of Labour (CCL) established the Office and Professional Workers Organizing Committee (OPWOC) after bank workers in Toronto and Montreal expressed interest in unionizing. Sufrin quit her job as an office worker and became a full-time organizer for OPWOC. Given the low wages and poor working conditions of bank employees, including unpaid overtime, penalties for cash shortages, and policies that required employees to seek management's permission before marrying, OPWOC membership grew quickly. Working with few resources and sharing a desk and phone with three men, Sufrin established seven locals in Toronto with approximately 1,000 members. By November 1941, employees of the Banque Canadienne Nationale (BCN) in Montreal were officially chartered as OPWOC Local 5. Management responded by alleging the union had communist ties and intimidating employees, often transferring them to other branches or forcing them to quit. On April 30, 1942, BCN employees erected picket lines outside BCN branches, launching the first bank strike in Canadian history. The number of workers who participated in the strike is unclear because of starkly conflicting figures provided by the BCN and OPWOC, but the Ottawa Journal reported that 17 of BCN's 70 Montreal branches were forced to close while others were kept open by managers working alone. Many of the strikers returned to work after the first week of the strike, though 39 remained on the picket lines. The strike officially ended on May 23 after BCN fired the remaining 39 strikers and the drive to unionize bank workers effectively collapsed. =United Steelworkers= After the BCN strike, Sufrin continued to work as a union organizer. In 1943, she began working for the United Steelworkers (USW) and helped organize 17,000 employees of the John Inglis plant in Toronto. During the year-long union drive, she focused her efforts on recruiting the 7,000 women who were employed there. The work was demanding; Sufrin would often wake up at 5:00 am to distribute leaflets to the early shift and then stay out past midnight distributing them to the swing shift. The drive was successful but Sufrin, her weight having fallen to just 100 pounds, was left physically and mentally exhausted and she suffered what she described as a nervous breakdown. She was transferred to Vancouver later in 1943 where she spent the next three-and-a-half years fulfilling various administrative roles training union officers, managing finances, handling publicity, and editing a paper for the Vancouver Labor Council. =The Eaton Drive= In 1947, the CCL made the decision to attempt to organize employees at Eaton's, then known as the T. Eaton Company. At the time, Eaton's was Canada's largest department store and third-largest employer, behind the federal government and the railroads. It had 40,000 employees across Canada, including 13,000 in Toronto alone. The union specifically targeted the company's three Toronto locations given their proximity to labour's head offices. The Eaton's local was named the Department Store Employees Union and Sufrin, on loan from the USW, was named director. In January 1948, Sufrin headed up a team of five and established a headquarters in a three-room office across the street from Eaton's mail-order warehouse. Her team included Lynn Williams, a union organizer who would later become president of the USW. Over the next four years, Sufrin and her team employed a wide range of gimmicks to recruit new members and allay fears of strikes, ties to communism, and instant dismissal. They distributed leaflets outside stores on a weekly basis. They launched a weekly illustrated newspaper and a series of paid, five-minute radio programs. Activists were given small bags of peanuts with the slogan ‚ÄúDon't work for Peanuts‚Äù as conversation starters, while employees were handed white collars cut from white card that read ‚ÄúDon't Let it be a Yoke‚Äù. Members of other unions wearing badges that read ‚ÄúUnion Pay Is Good ‚Äì I Get It!‚Äù would hand out shopping bags imprinted ‚ÄúJoin Local 1000‚Äù (the number assigned to the Eaton's local) to customers as they entered the store. Union activities also included a number of social events, including a bowling team, a Miss Local 1000 contest, and a float in the Labour Day Parade. Sufrin's team faced a number of obstacles, often with the employees themselves. Eaton's employed a variety of workers with different needs. Sellers of higher end goods such as furs and good furniture tended to identify with the Eaton dynasty rather than with labour unions. Salesmen on commission tended to see themselves as entrepreneurs rather than employees. High turnover rates ‚Äì as high as 20 to 30 per cent per year ‚Äì also presented difficulties in retaining new members and, over the course of four years, the union lost roughly 3,000 members through attrition. Other problems were more political in nature. In 1950, after 5,000 employees had signed membership applications, a revision to the Ontario Labour Relations Act required a $1 initiation fee with every application, meaning that organizers had to go back and attempt to collect it. The union applied for certification in October 1950. Organizers had signed up approximately 6,000 of Eaton's 13,000 Toronto employees, above the 45 per cent threshold that would permit them to apply for certification, but well below the 55 per cent required for automatic certification. However, proceedings stalled for over a year. A vote was finally held in December 1951 and the union was defeated by a margin of 4,769 votes against and 3,967 in favour. Sufrin and her team continued to canvass Eaton's employees for another year, but they were unable to raise the support necessary for another vote. While the campaign was ultimately unsuccessful, the pressure pushed Eaton's to improve employee wages and benefits. Over the course of four years, Eaton's had periodically granted wage increases totalling as much as $20 per week, nearly doubling some employees' salaries. Additionally, Eaton's introduced pension and health plans. =Later career= In 1952, Sufrin returned to the USW where she continued to organize white-collar workers and negotiate new contracts. From 1959 to 1964, Sufrin worked as an industrial relations officer with the Saskatchewan provincial government. She later took a job with the federal labour department researching the problems of women in the workplace. Personal life Sufrin met her husband, Bernard ‚ÄúBert‚Äù Sufrin (1916-1995), an economist and fellow CCF worker, while working at the Saskatchewan government finance office. They married in 1960 and moved to Ottawa in 1964 where Bert worked for the Labour Department of the Women's Bureau. They retired to White Rock, British Columbia by 1972. Sufrin remained active with the NDP and founded the Surrey-White Rock branch of the Choice of Dying Society. Sufrin died in White Rock in 1999 at the age of 86. Williams, who had been Sufrin's colleague during the Eaton's drive, wrote in The Globe and Mail: > To know Eileen was to know the true meaning of loyalty and friendship. She > never failed to keep in touch. She practised what she believed every day of > her life. One of her caregivers (during the last years of her life) was > injured when she tripped over the leash while walking Eileen‚Äôs dog. No > problem: Eileen provided workers‚Äô compensation coverage. Legacy In 1979, Sufrin was awarded the Governor General‚Äôs Medal, one of seven Canadian women honoured on the 50th anniversary of the Persons Case.

It is dedicated to the Archangels Michael and Gabriel. The ktetors were the merchants Dobre S√Ærbu and Radu Cupetu, whose portraits appear in the vestibule; it is sometimes known as the Merchants‚Äô Church. The cruciform church was built between 1748 and 1764. The church suffered damage during the Russo-Austro-Turkish wars. It was repaired by Wallachian princes Alexander Mourouzis in 1793 and by John Caradja in 1813. For a time, a princely school operated in rooms near the church.Alin Ion, ‚ÄúIstoria bisericii cu filosofi din T√¢rgu-Jiu, unicƒÉ √Æn Rom√¢nia‚Äù, AdevƒÉrul, October 14, 2016 The church was initially painted in Byzantine style fresco during the 18th century. In 1843, the iconostasis was painted with support from Pavel Kiselyov. In 1854-1855, the frescoes were painted over in Renaissance style by Mi»ôu Popp, while the spires were lengthened. Repairs, especially of the exterior, took place in 1902 and in 1933-1940. Historian Nicolae Iorga was involved in the latter restoration, suggesting that the spire extensions be removed, the windows narrowed, the facade ledges brought back. The interior paintings were cleaned, while the old exterior frescoes, featuring philosophers and sibyls, were redone by local painter Iosif Keber. Among the figures depicted are Socrates, Aristotle, Pythagoras, Diogenes, Hippocrates and Plutarch. Such subjects are virtually unique for churches in Romania. During the Communist regime, the church stood in front of the local Romanian Communist Party headquarters. As such, it was targeted for demolition, but was saved by vigorous protests from experts. Nevertheless, the church was shut down in 1960 and became a museum in the early 1980s. It reopened as a church on Christmas Eve of 1989, during the Romanian Revolution; further repairs followed. Excavations around the foundation have revealed human bones, suggesting the presence of a cemetery in the past. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

Since 2019 he has served as a Senator and leader of Mouvement r√©formateur.  Early life  Bouchez was born in Frameries on March 23, 1986 to modest, independent parents. His grandparents were soldiers and mine workers originally from Italy. He grew up in Colfontaine and Quaregnon, and attended l‚Äô√âcole des Cannoniers in Mons from 1992-1998 and Coll√®ge Saint Stanislas in Mons for his secondary studies, where he graduated in 2004. Bouchez studied law with a minor in political science at the Universit√© Saint- Louis - Bruxelles from 2004-2007 and received his Master's in public law from the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles two years later. His dissertation, under the guidance of Prof Marc Uyttendaele, was entitled ¬´ Suite √† la pol√©mique de l‚Äôaffaire Fortis : Jusqu‚Äôo√π la n√©cessit√© politique peut-elle aller dans la violation des r√®gles de droit ? ¬ª.  Political career  After finishing his graduate studies in 2009, he began to work in the office of Cabinet minister Didier Reynders as an advisor. At the same time, he worked as a legal assistant at the Facult√©s Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix in Namur and later was appointed the law practice officer at UMons (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles). In December 2011, following the creation of a new government, Bouchez again became an advisor to Reynders, who had been appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. = Local politics = At age 20, he ran in his first election, running as a member of the Mouvement R√©formateur for local elections in 2006 in the city of Mons. Placed fourth on the party list, he received 397 votes, missing election by a few votes. In the 2010 elections, he was listed 8th on the MR's electoral list for the Senate. In 2012, Bouchez was chosen by his colleagues in the MR to run at the top of the electoral list for communal elections in Mons. He received 2,550 votes and served as the √âchevin for Budget, Finance, Employment and Sustainable Development for the city under Elio Di Rupo's PS-MR coalition. During the 2014 regional elections Bouchez was listed as a first substitute on the MR list and received 4,535 votes. When Jacqueline Galant became federal minister of mobility, Bouchez became a Member of the Parliament of Wallonia and a member of the Parliament of the French Community of Belgium. In April 2016, Jacqueline Galant resigned her role in the federal government following several controversies. Because Bouchez was Galant's substitute, he lost his seats in both parliaments following her return. Four days later, as Bouchez was set to return to his role as √âchevin, Mons mayor Elio Di Rupo changed his coalition partner from the MR to the cdH, making Bouchez a communal councilor. In June 2016, Boluchez became more involved in internal party politics. He joined the Centre Jean Gol, a liberal think tank, and worked to organize and brainstorm new policy ideas for the MR. At the Mouvement r√©formateur's 2016 policy convention, he fought against attempts by Louis Michel to get rid of compulsory voting, advocated for a universal basic income, increased taxation on robots taking peoples jobs, proposed a second round of elections so citizens could choose from possible coalition options, and advocated for the criminalization of those who praise the Nazi occupation of Belgium. During the 2018 communal elections, rather than run under the Mouvement Reformateur, Bouchez formed a new opposition electoral alliance called ¬´ Mons en Mieux ! ¬ª (Mons for the Better!). He was joined by members of the cdH (including Opaline Meunier), the PS and Ecolo and the alliance was supported by the FGTB et CSC unions The alliance received 22% of the vote, gaining 11 seats in the local council, with eight of the seats won by people under 35 years old (the most since 1994). Bouchez himself received the third largest number of first preference votes in the city (4,976 votes). However, the PS and Ecolo decided to form a coalition, shutting Bouchez out of a leadership role locally.  Federal politics  Bouchez at his first caucus meeting as leader On March 19, 2019 Charles Michel, leader of the Mouvement R√©formateur, named Bouchez as the party's spokesperson during the federal election campaign. In the 2019 federal elections, Bouchez was placed fourth on the MR electoral list for Hennuy√®re constituency in Braine- le-Comte, a relatively safe area for the MR electorally. He received 16,522 votes in Hainaut province, the second highest number of first-preference votes. However, he was not elected due to vote transfers within the electoral system. Nevertheless, he became a co-opted Senator for the MR, getting sworn in on July 12, 2019.. In the Senate, he worked with his colleagues to increase voting rights for Belgians living abroad in regional elections as well as increasing access to vaccines.. In October 2019, Bouchez was one of five candidates who ran to replace Charles Michel as leader of the Mouvement R√©formateur. On November 28, 2019, Bouchez was elected leader of the party, beating rival Denis Ducarme in the second round with 62% of the vote. On December 10,2019, Bouchez was designated Informateur by King Philippe along with Joachim Coens, leader of CD&V;, in an attempt to find a workable government coalition following the 2019 federal election.. After being unable to find a solution, both men were discharged from their informateur duties on January 31, 2020.  Books  * G.-L. Bouchez, L'aurore d'un monde nouveau, √âditions du CEP, 2017.

During the war he was awarded the Iron Cross, first and second class, and the Bavarian Military Merit Cross. He was discharged from military service as a Vizefeldwebel in the Reserves. After the war he again worked in the field, and then as an office manager in his parents' brick and stone quarry. Erbersdobler joined the Nazi Party in October 1923 shortly before the party was banned as a result of the Beer Hall Putsch. He then served as an Ortsgruppenleiter (Local Group Leader) in his hometown for the V√∂lkisch-Social Bloc, a Nazi front organization active during the ban. Nazi career Erbersdobler rejoined the NSDAP on 27 February 1925 (membership number 14,607) just as soon as the party was again legalized. He became an Ortsgruppenleiter in F√ºrstenzell and briefly in Bayreuth. In 1927 he advanced to Kreisleiter (County Leader) and in 1928 to Bezirksleiter (District Leader). In 1929 he was elected to the Bezirkstag (District Assembly) in Passau. On 1 March 1929 Erbersdobler succeeded Gregor Strasser as Gauleiter for the Gau of Lower Bavaria.

Candidatus Thiodictyon syntrophicum grows best under micro-oxic and low light conditions. There has only been one successful isolate of Candidatus Thiodictyon syntrophicum; Candidatus Thiodictyon syntrophicum strain Cad16T.  Classification  Candidatus Thiodictyon syntrophicum belongs to the family Chromatiaceae and class Gammaproteobacteria. This species is known to be related to the genera Lamprocystis, Thiocystis and Thiocapsa. Strain Cad16T was previously assigned to the genus Lamprocystis, but was recently reassigned to the genus Thiodictyon by Peduzzi et al. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to separate Cad16T from Lamprocystis due to differences in cell morphology/arrangemnet, caretenoid groups and chemolithotrophic growth; all of which are important factors used to consider Cad16T a member of the genus Thiodictyon rather than the genus Lamprocystis.  Environment  The Cad16T strain of Candidatus Thiodictyon syntrophicum was isolated from Lake Cadagno. This lake is meromictic, and its layers create diverse ecological niches which support the growth of diverse and often novel species. Lake Cadagno is euxinic, meaning it is both anoxic and sulphidic at depth.  Strain Cad16T  Cad16T is a novel strain of Candidatus Thiodictyon syntrophicum which was isolated from the chemocline of a crenogenic meromictic lake. 16S rRNA gene sequence data shows that Cad16T is closely related to Thiodictyon bacillosum DSM234T (99.2% sequence similarity) and Thiodictyon elegans DSM232T (98.9% sequence similarity). = Carbon fixation = Candidatus Thiodictyon syntrophicum strain Cad16T has the capability for CO2 fixation, and was found to play a key role in the overall inorganic carbon fixation that occurred in Lake Cadagno. = Sulfur cycling = This strain of Candidatus Thiodictyon syntrophicum is a species of PSB. Researchers discovered that strain Cad16T creates and stores sulfur globules intracellularly. The pure cultures of Cad16T were found to utilize sulfide and elemental sulfur as their electron donors. Cad16T is known to have syntrophic associations and cell-to-cell aggregation with Desulfocapsa sp., which is also a member of the genus Thiodictyon. Desulfocapsa sp. is a sulfate reducing and sulfur disproportionating bacteria found in both mixed culture and within the natural environment.

Zorbas originated as an extratropical cyclone in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Warm sea surface temperatures allowed the system to quickly deepen and transition into a tropical cyclone. Zorbas intensified as it headed northward towards Greece, finally reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and a minimum central pressure of on September 29. Heavy rain and flash flooding from Zorbas killed 5 people in Tunisia. In addition, one person was killed and two were declared missing in Greece. Meteorological history A first outlook about the possible development of a shallow warm-core cyclone in the Mediterranean was issued by ESTOFEX on 25 September 2018, and a second extended outlook was issued on 26 September 2018. On 27 September 2018, an extratropical storm developed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Water temperatures of around 27 ¬∞C (81 ¬∞F) supported the storm's transition into a hybrid cyclone, with a warm thermal core in the center. The storm moved northeastward toward Greece, gradually intensifying and developing characteristics of a tropical cyclone. On September 29, the storm made landfall at peak intensity in the Peloponnese, west of Kalamata, where a minimum central pressure of was reported. ESTOFEX reported on Zorbas as \\"Mediterranean Cyclone 2018M02\\", with the same pressure of at Kalamata, further estimating the minimum central pressure of the cyclone to be , with one-minute maximum sustained winds of and a Dvorak number of T4.0, which all translate into marginal Category 1 hurricane characteristics for the cyclone. Early on 1 October, Zorbas emerged into the Aegean Sea, while accelerating northeastward. On 2 October, Zorbas moved over northwestern Turkey and dissipated. A cold wake was observed in the Mediterranean Sea, with sea surface temperatures dropping along the track of Zorbas due to strong upwelling. It is unknown who named the system Zorbas, but the name is officially recognized for a medicane by the Deutscher Wetterdienst. Preparations Ships were ordered remain docked in the ports of Piraeus, Rafina and Lavrio on Saturday by port authorities due to gale-force winds up to 10 on the Beaufort scale blowing in the Aegean Sea. Ferry services of Rio to Antirrio, Kyllini to Zakynthos, and Kyllini to Kefalonia were also suspended.https://greekcitytimes.com/2018/09/30/cyclone-zorbas-hits-the- peloponnese-causing-flash-flooding-videos/ Impact and aftermath During its formative stages, the storm caused flash flooding in Tunisia and Libya, with around 200 mm (8 in) of rainfall observed. The floods killed five people in Tunisia, while also damaging homes, roads, and fields. The Tunisian government pledged financial assistance to residents whose homes were damaged. In advance of the storm's landfall in Greece, the Hellenic National Meteorological Office issued a severe warning. Several flights were canceled, and schools were closed. The offshore islands of Strofades and Rhodes reported gale-force winds during the storm's passage. A private weather station in Voutsaras measured wind gusts of . The storm spawned a waterspout that moved onshore. Gale-force winds in Athens knocked down trees and power lines. A fallen tree destroyed the roof of a school in western Athens. Dozens of roads were closed due to flooding. In Ioannina, the storm damaged the minaret on the top of the Aslan Pasha Mosque, which dates to 1614. From 29 to 30 September, Zorbas produced flash flooding in Greece and parts of western Turkey, with the storm dropping as much as 200 mm (8 in) in Greece and spawning multiple waterspouts. Three people were reporting missing in Greece after the flash floods; one person was found but the other two individuals remained missing, as of 3 October.

He has studied them not only in the Mediterranean but in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. Exploration of underwater grottoes, together with Jacques Laborel and Jo Hamelin, revealed the existence of sponges dating from very ancient geological periods and the unexpected existence of carnivorous sponges, and surprisingly, the grottoes in some ways mimicked life at much greater depths.

Origins and evolution  The term has been coined by race and racism scholar Ambalavaner Sivanandan and expanded on by other scholars like Liz Fekete. Sivanandan defined it in his 2001 article Poverty is a New Black as \\"xenophobia that bears all marks of the old racism, except that it is not colour coded. It is racism in substance, though xeno in form.\\" Fekete expanded the term to describe Islamophobia in Europe, suggesting that the same phenomenon affects communities that have settled in Europe for decades and have been previously more integrated, but whose members are now seen as foreigners, through scholars are still discussing whether this term should indeed apply to wider context.  Usage  The term xenoracism has been used to describe racism experienced by white Eastern European economic migrants in Western Europe at the turn of the 21st century, following the fall of communism and EU enlargement. Among others, this term has been used to describe the discriminatory treatment of Poles in the United Kingdom as well as Romanichal in the United Kingdom or West Africans in Italy. The term has also been used to describe older phenomena, such as the discrimination against Irish people in the United Kingdom. Additionally, it has been suggested that this term is similar to and overlaps with historical and modern anti-semitism and Islamophobia. Other groups commonly affected, in addition to immigrants, are refugees, asylum seekers, and other displaced people, though some scholars think that racism against such groups may merit a different term. The concept has also been used in the analysis of the racism in the United States.

Design and description The submarines of the K6 sub-class were versions of the preceding K5 sub-class with greater range and diving depth. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of .Bagnasco, p. 187 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor.Chesneau, p. 203 They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the K6s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with four internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of ten torpedoes. They were also armed with a single L/40 anti-aircraft gun and two single AA guns.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 124 Construction and commissioning Ro-49 was laid down on 16 November 1942 by Mitsui Zosensho at Tamano, Japan, as Submarine No. 390. She was named Ro-49 on 31 July 1943 and was attached provisionally to the Maizuru Naval District that day. Launched on 3 August 1943, she was completed and commissioned on 19 May 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-49 was attached formally to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 33 for workups. In mid-July 1944, she and the submarine took part in tests of a submarine version of the Type 13 air- search radar. She was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 11 on 15 August 1944 and then to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet on 10 November 1944. =First war patrol= On 16 November 1944, Ro-49 departed Kure, Japan, to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Philippine Sea east of Luzon in the Philippine Islands. Her hydrophone suffered damage in rough seas, and on 28 November 1944 her commanding officer decided to return to Japan. She returned to Kure on 7 December 1944. =Second war patrol= Ro-49 set out from Kure on 1 January 1945 to begin her second war patrol, again in the Philippine Sea east of the Philippines. On 4 January 1945, she received new orders to patrol in the South China Sea west of Luzon. U.S. forces entered Lingayen Gulf and U.S. forces began their invasion of Luzon on 9 January 1945. Ro-49 was in the South China Sea west-northwest of Iba on Luzon on 12 January 1945 when she sighted two escort aircraft carriers and three battleships with a strong escort. She attacked and her commanding officer reported that she sank what he described as an \\"Idaho-class\\" battleship, but her claim of hitting a battleship was disproven after World War II. On 21 January 1945 he received an order to return to Kure, which she reached on 1 February 1945. She moved to Saeki on 16 March 1945. =Third war patrol= On 18 March 1945, Ro-49 got underway from Saeki for her third war patrol, assigned a patrol area southeast of the Ryukyu Islands. After she sent a routine situation report on 25 March 1945, the Japanese never heard from her again. =Loss= On 26 March 1945, a Japanese submarine attacked United States Navy Task Group 54.3 off the Ryukyus. At 09:32, the heavy cruiser sighted a periscope to starboard, and she made an emergency turn to starboard to evade a torpedo. The light cruiser also sighted torpedo wakes. The attacking submarine scored no hits but escaped without facing a counterattack by the cruisers‚Ä≤ escorts. The identity of the attacking submarine remains unknown, although historians have attributed the attack both to Ro-49 and to a Type C K≈ç-hy≈çteki-class midget submarine, in the latter case also claiming that the attack took place on 27 March 1945. On 5 April 1945, the destroyer was on radar picket duty off Kume Island near Okinawa when she received a signal from the support landing craft reporting the sighting of a submarine. While the submarine was on the surface, Hudson detected it on radar at 0345. Hudson closed the range and fired a star shell to illuminate the area, and the submarine dived, causing it to disappear from Hudson‚Ä≤s radar. However, Hudson established sonar contact on the submerged submarine and made six depth-charge attacks over the next six hours, sinking the submarine at . The identity of the submarine Hudson sank remains unclear. It could have been Ro-49. Some Japanese sources claim that Ro-49 was already missing by 5 April 1945 and that Hudson sank the submarine , although I-56 might have been sunk on 18 April 1945 instead. Some accounts claim that the submarine sank Ro-49 in the Bungo Strait on 24 February 1945, but Ro-49 was active for at least a month after that date. On 15 April 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared Ro-49 to be presumed lost southeast of Okinawa with all 79 men on board. She was stricken from the Navy list on 25 May 1945.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 43 resources, which included 33 contributing buildings, one contributing structure, and nine non- contributing buildings. In addition, the district also contains 33 buildings that are individually listed on the National Register. This historic district is bordered by four other districts: the Crescent Warehouse Historic District and the Davenport Motor Row and Industrial Historic District on the east, the Hamburg Historic District to the northwest, and the West Third Street Historic District on the west. History Davenport was founded in 1836 on land along the Mississippi River that was part of the Black Hawk Purchase, a tract of land in what is now eastern Iowa. It was platted by land company stockholders that included George Davenport, a merchant and trader at Fort Armstrong and the city's namesake, and Antoine LeClaire, a French-Indian interpreter, lawyer, and speculator. Part of the original town plat is within the historic district. Because there was a question concerning the title to the land, lots were slow to sell so LeClaire platted additions on land to the east of the original plat, also in the district. He received the land as the interpreter for the 1832 treaty that ended the Black Hawk War. He set aside one of the squares for St. Anthony's Catholic Church, the town's first church, which has been located there ever since. Scott County Courthouse (1956) Scott County was established by the legislature of the Wisconsin Territory in 1837, and the city fought a protracted battle for the county seat from 1838 to 1840. As part of the deal to gain that distinction, Davenport and LeClaire donated a park square for the courthouse, and the county's three courthouses and its jail have all been built there. The first court sessions were held in St. Anthony's Church until the first courthouse was completed. Davenport was the first city in Iowa to receive rail service. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRI&P;) entered the city in 1856 after the first railroad bridge across the Mississippi River was completed in 1856. The CRI&Ps; mainline followed the base of the river bluff on the north side of the downtown area. From 1901 to 1903 the tracks were elevated along Fifth Street. They are the contributing structure in the historic district. The CRI&P; passenger station was also located in the district, but service ended there in 1968 and the depot was torn down in the 1970s. The city was also served by three other rail lines, five streetcar lines, and an interurban line called the Iowa and Illinois Railway. The latter's station is still extant on Brady Street. The period of significance for the historic district is from 1850, when the present St. Anthony's Church was begun, until 1968 when the present Davenport Public Library was completed. During the intervening years buildings were constructed for civic, commercial, light industrial, entertainment, multiple dwelling, and fraternal uses. By the 1890s the city had become the financial center of the region and the state. The district was the location for the city's financial institutions, including the city's tallest building, Davenport Bank and Trust (1927). Several hotels, including the Davenport Hotel (1907), were built in the district to serve the main train stations and Hotel Blackhawk (1914, 1920) was a convention-oriented hotel. In addition to the county courthouse, the district also includes Davenport City Hall (1895), Central Fire Station (1901), and the United States Courthouse (1933). Light industrial uses included cigar manufacturing, wood planning, and carriage and plow manufacturing before those buildings were converted into other uses. Initially, commerce focused on dry goods, groceries, specialty stores, and wholesale goods before fashionable department stores were built, including the J.H.C. Petersen's Sons' Store (1892) and M.L. Parker (1922). Multiple theaters were located in the district, but only two remain the Capital Theatre (1922) and the former RKO Orpheum (1931). Of the apartment buildings constructed downtown, the Dorothea (1910) was one of the few buildings constructed by a woman.

The accident occurred when a switch from the mainline to a freight siding was found to be open, and the Limited left the mainline, overrunning the siding at high speed. The cause of the accident was never officially determined, but overwhelming evidence points to deliberate sabotage of the switch. The 20th Century Limited had only gone into service three years prior on June 17, 1902. The duration of the New York City to Chicago run had recently been reduced from 20 hours to 18 hours the same month. Incident The 20th Century Limited running on the Boston and Albany Railroad sometime in the early 1900s. Similar to the train involved in the crash. Train No. 26, the 20th Century Limited was approaching the small farm town of Mentor, Ohio from the west, running on a mainline owned by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. Conflicting reports exist as to whether the train was running behind schedule. It was crowded with 67 passengers on board.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mADxrgyqXWE At 9:20 p.m. (EDT), the engine lurched to the left as it entered a freight depot siding at a speed of approximately . The high speed of the consist mixed with the short length of the siding left for no time to prevent the accident, and the engine canted over onto its left side, ejecting fireman Aaron Gorham from his position and fatally crushing the engineer at the regulator. The engine plowed through a Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway freight depot, and in the same beat the boiler exploded. A Chicago sleeping car situated immediately behind the locomotive telescoped into the tender, and caught fire in the resulting explosion. The second, a combination car, landed on top of the carnage and was destroyed much the same. The third car, another sleeper, left the track. No other cars derailed in the crash. Rescuers responded almost immediately, but the heat from the fire kept them at bay. As a result, the ensuing fire burned for almost four or five hours, not being contained until 12:00 a.m. (EDT) on June 22. Physicians came from as far as Cleveland and as nearby as Painesville, to offer aid. Ultimately, 21 passengers were killed due to the wreck or the fire, most burned beyond recognition. Five were seriously injured, and \\"more than a score\\" were minorly injured. Some of the injured were placed aboard a relief train that took them to Cleveland, and others were hurried into ambulances that rushed to nearby hospitals. The last body was pulled from the wreckage at approximately 1:00 a.m. (EDT) on June 22. One of those killed was C.H. Wellman, who had a friend in Mentor by the name of Horace Andrews, the president of the Cleveland Electric Railway Company. Andrews was summoned to the accident site, just in time to receive a final message from Wellman himself for his wife. Investigation Colorized photograph of the scene; likely taken after June 21, due to a car being removed. Speculation in the media pointed at speed as a factor of the accident, an accusation that was discarded as unfounded.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15299772/train-wreck-at-mentor-ohio- in-1905/ It was found that 50 minutes before the Limited had arrived in Mentor, Train No. 10 from Chicago to Boston had passed through the switch without fault. Additionally, no other trains came through the area between the time of No. 10's departure and the wreck. Alex Hammond, the conductor of the Limited, inspected the switch shortly after the disaster, and found that it was set and even locked for the sidetrack. Also, a white light showing the positioning of the track was found to be in the \\"clear\\" position, which was supposed to indicate that the points were set for the mainline. With this evidence, the New York Central Railroad insisted that the accident was the result of willful misplacement of the switch by an unknown party. After an investigation, Assistant General Superintendent D.C. Moon of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern issued a statement that corroborated this belief, stating that he was \\"satisfied that somebody, with a key, opened the switch with malicious intent. The train did not jump the track.\\" Despite efforts, no party was ever found at fault and to this day, the official cause of the accident is undetermined. Aftermath The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway freight depot that was destroyed in the accident was rebuilt in 1909, and is still there today. Directly opposite the freight depot, the former Mentor railroad station at the corner of Station and Hart Streets, became New York Central property when it merged with the LS&MS; in 1914. Passenger service to Mentor ended in 1949, and as of August 2007 the station is now occupied by Deekers Side Tracks, a sports bar.

Background Pippie was bred at Eureka Stud in Cambooya, Queensland and later sold through the 2017 Inglis Classic Yearling sale in Sydney. She was purchased for A$60,000 by her trainer John Meagher. Racing career =2017/18: two-year-old season= Pippie made her race debut on the 5 July 2018 in a 1,000 metre race at Cranbourne. Taken straight to the front by jockey Noel Callow, Pippie streaked away from her rivals to win by 5 lengths. =2018/19: three-year-old season= On 4 August 2018, Pippie contested a 1,000 metre handicap for three year old fillies at Moonee Valley. Jumping slowly from the barriers she settled midfield throughout the race. After briefly hitting the front in the home straight under Noel Callow, she was eventually passed by Multaja from the Godolphin stable and finished in 2nd position beaten by 2 lengths. On 18 August 2018, Pippie contested her first stakes race in the Group 3 Quezette Stakes, run over 1,100 metres at Caulfield. Regular jockey Noel Callow was replaced as rider for Ben Melham in this race. Starting the $3.80 favourite Pippie raced on speed but faded to finish in 7th place, beaten by eventual multiple Group 1 winning mare Sunlight. After her run in the Quezette Stakes, Pippie pulled up sore and it was decided by her trainers to give her a lengthy break. Co-trainer Chris Meagher said, ‚ÄúPippie pulled up sore from the Quezette and we decided to give her plenty of time off. She‚Äôs definitely maturing, but we still have to treat her with kid gloves as she can lighten off quite quickly.‚Äù Pippie resumed her racing career some 11 months later on the 13 July 2019, when she contested a 1,200 metre race at Doomben. Leading all the way, Pippie won by a margin of three and a quarter lengths. =2019/20: four-year-old season= After her first up win at Doomben, Pippie had a month between runs, next contesting a handicap race at Caulfield on the 17 August 2018. She again led all the way to win by three lengths. Co-trainer Chris Meagher commented on her speed after the race, ‚ÄúShe has a high cruising speed. She puts herself there and eliminates bad luck. For her to do that today, pretty well untouched was quite impressive.‚Äù Two weeks later Pippie started the $2.05 favourite in the 2019 Cockram Stakes at Caulfield. This would prove to be Pippie's first win at stakes level in the Group 3 leading all the way to win by a margin of one and a quarter lengths. At her next start in the How Now Stakes at Caulfield on the 21 September 2019, Pippie was attempting to win her fourth race in a row. Starting the odds-on favourite at $1.95, Pippie jumped well and was taken straight to the front, however upon straightening she was eased down by jockey Ben Melham finishing well behind the rest of the field. Melham later stated that he felt the horse had injured herself, although a post-race veterinary examination revealed no abnormalities. With no other explanation than the horse putting in a bad run in the How Now Stakes, Pippie then contested the Begonia Belle Stakes at Flemington on the 2 November 2019. Ridden by Damien Oliver, Pippie was run down late to be beaten one and a quarter lengths into second place. After a three month spell, Pippie's next race would be her first at Group 1 level in the Oakleigh Plate on 22 February 2020. With regular jockey Ben Melham unable to make the weight allocated of 52kg, Linda Meech was selected to ride her in the race. Pippie began brilliantly from her wide barrier and crossed the field of 18 runners to lead in the 1,100 metre race. She was full of running around the home turn and opened up a winning break halfway up the home straight to beat the fast-finishing Zoutori by a half- length. Her winning time of 1:01.93 was just 0.20 seconds outside the track record. Pippie's next run would be in the William Reid Stakes at Moonee Valley on the 20 March 2020 over 1,200 metres. Despite co-trainer Chris Meagher saying pre-race that Pippie ‚Äúwill definitely lead‚Äù, she was unable to find the lead and was beaten three and a quarter lengths into 4th placing after starting at odds of $13. Pippie's next assignments were to be the Robert Sangster Stakes and The Goodwood in South Australia, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, travel restrictions were put in place. Pippie instead contested the $200,000 Vobis Gold Sprint at Caulfield on the 18 April 2020 over 1,200 metres. Installed a $2 favourite due to the set weight conditions of the race, Pippie showed her customary speed to lead the race however was a spent force soon after straightening finishing in 6th position. Co-trainer Chris Meagher stated he was disappointed with the run and that the horse would be spelled immediately. =2020/21: five-year-old season= After a five month break, Pippie resumed racing on the 25 September 2020, in the Moir Stakes over 1,000 metres at Moonee Valley. Ridden by jockey Damian Lane and starting the second favourite at odds of $6.50, Pippie jumped straight to the lead and led all the way to win her second Group 1, defeating the fast finishing Trekking by three quarters of a length. Jockey Lane said after the race, ‚ÄúNever been on one quicker early than Pippie‚Äù.

They may also be called overviews of reviews, reviews of reviews, summaries of systematic reviews, or syntheses of reviews. Umbrella reviews are among the highest levels of evidence currently available in medicine. By summarizing information from multiple overview articles, umbrella reviews make it easier to review the evidence and allow for comparison of results between each of the individual reviews.

Palaeontographical Society, London, 14 pp Owen in 1859 also referred a front of the lower jaws, specimen CAMSM B54421. However, this piece is not of the same individual as the holotype and there is no proof for any connection with Pterodactylus sedgwickii. It was then largely ignored in modern literature until 2013, when Rodrigues and Kellner assigned it to their new genus Camposipterus. However, even they were unsure of this placement, calling it Camposipterus(?) sedgwickii. Finally, in 2020, Holgado and P√™gas assigned it to its own genus, Aerodraco; the genus name means \\"air dragon\\", in reference to the 1901 book Dragons of the Air by Harry Seeley. Description Rodrigues & Kellner established two autapomorphies of Camposipterus(?) sedgwickii. The expanded section of the front snout is suddenly constricted behind the third tooth pair. The tooth sockets of the third tooth pair are much larger than those of the fourth pair. There is a unique combination of traits: the snout is deep; the midline ridge on the palate towards the front reaches a position behind the third tooth pair, which distinguishes Aerodraco from Camposipterus.  Classification  In 2020, Holgado & P√™gas placed Aerodraco in the subfamily Coloborhynchinae, which they placed in the family Anhangueridae. They found it completely unrelated to Pterodactylus, the genus Aerodraco was originally placed within during 1859.

Based on a 2018 short film titled Krista, also directed by Danny Madden, the film stars Shirley Chen, Will Madden, and Jose Angeles as three young adults whose lives intersect in a suburban town. Beast Beast was executive produced by Alec Baldwin, and premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. Plot In a suburban town in the Southern United States, a high school student named Krista is a member of her school's theater program. In her childhood, she produced short videos with her next-door neighbor, the recently graduated Adam. Adam has since started a YouTube channel to which he uploads videos of himself providing demonstrations on using various models of firearms that he owns. However, his videos are receiving little attention online, and his father disapproves of his focusing on his YouTube presence rather than finding a job elsewhere. Nito, a skateboarder, attends the same school as Krista. One day, while idling outside the apartment where he and his apathetic guardian live, Nito meets a fellow tenant named Yoni, who invites Nito to a party that night after seeing him perform a kickflip. At the party, Nito interacts with Krista, who earlier that evening had watched videos of Nito skateboarding online. Later on, police officers arrive to break up the party. In the commotion, a male partygoer tries to grab Krista, and Nito fights him off. Krista escapes but Nito is arrested. After being released from jail, Nito is picked up in a car by Yoni and Yoni's friends Lena and Jarrett. Yoni, Lena, and Jarrett convince Nito to help them steal items such as Hot Pockets and perfume. During school, Nito and Krista grow closer; he tries to show her how to skateboard, and she teaches him how to imitate being slapped and choked for stage purposes. While working on a performance inspired by a past experience Nito had with a parakeet, he and Krista share a kiss. In an effort to attract more viewers and subscribers to his YouTube channel, Adam produces a dramatized video of himself detailing an experience he claimed to have had wherein he fended off an attack by a wild warthog using a firearm. When the video receives a number of negative and insulting comments, Adam becomes infuriated and records a video of himself angrily responding to and threatening the commenters. Lena drives Nito, Yoni, and Jarrett to the house where her boss lives, and demands that they break in and retrieve her vape pen, which her boss confiscated from her. Her boss is Adam's mother, and when Nito, Yoni, and Jarrett enter the house, Adam hears them from his upstairs bedroom. Jarrett begins to ascend the stairs leading up to the house's second floor, and Adam fatally shoots him from the top of the stairs with a rifle. After Adam proceeds to shoot Yoni, Nito attempts to flee, but is shot and killed by Adam after running outside. Krista, walking home from school with a friend, watches Nito die and sees an armed Adam standing in the doorway to the house. The incident is covered by the news, prompting Adam's YouTube channel to receive a surge of popularity. Online commenters and local police officials refer to Adam as a \\"hero\\" for standing his ground against the three intruders. Adam continues to make firearms-based videos that prove successful with his online followers, while Krista becomes an emotional wreck at school over the loss of Nito. When Adam is invited to speak at a conference about firearms, Krista attends and follows him into a restroom to confront him. She forces him to put his hands around her neck and she screams, drawing the attention of police officers in the building. Adam is detained, and the video he made in which he threatens his YouTube commenters is leaked to the public. Meanwhile, Krista returns to her theater classes with a sense of closure.

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on five critic reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Beandrea July of The Hollywood Reporter commended the film's lead performances, screenplay, cinematography, and sound editing, and wrote that, by the film's third act, \\"you realize what the movie is ultimately aiming to be: a cautionary tale about guns in America.\\" Varietys Amy Nicholson praised Angeles's performance and noted the film's humor, though she wrote that the film's third act \\"accelerates from reality to sensationalism, and trades humanity for pulp. Even in the noir climax, Beast Beasts ideas about validation and integrity are worth a grapple. If only the film's own self- identity was more grounded.\\" Monica Castillo of RogerEbert.com wrote that the film \\"will either win you over with Shirley Chen's effervescent screen presence or will doom its goodwill with its third act twist\\", calling it \\"a conflicted work, but not without its merits\\".

He said, \\"Because of my documentary background, we were able to construct a film that used a small crew to reach locations larger films could never go to...If you see David [Cross] hanging off a cliff, braving a thunderstorm, or struggling in freezing water, that's really him. When you see lava tunnels deep underground, that's where we shot.\\"  Release  The film was released virtually on September 18, 2020, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The film's website noted that some of the film's proceeds would be donated to \\"protect wildlife and wild places.\\"  Reception  Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, critic Frank Scheck called the film \\"awfully entertaining\\" and praised Cross's \\"touching and funnily self-effacing turn.\\" The Austin Chronicle's Richard Whittaker praised the film as \\"a beautiful, quiet, lyrical, funny wilderness trip, a meditation on loss and picking up the pieces, and the most perfectly poignant performance of David Cross' acting career.\\"  References  External links * * Category:2020 films Category:American films Category:Films set in Washington (state) ","title":"The Dark Divide"},{"id":"65421099","text":"Xiao Hunian (ËêßËÉ°Ëæá; 953‚Äì1009), also known as Hehan (ÂíåÁΩï) was a Khitan noble lady of imperial China's Liao dynasty. „ÄäËæΩÂè≤¬∑Á¨¨ÂçÅÂõõÂç∑¬∑Êú¨Á∫™Á¨¨ÂçÅÂõõ„Äã‰∫åÂçÅÂõõÂπ¥Êò•Ê≠£ÊúàÔºåÂ¶ÇÈ∏≥È∏ØÊ≥∫„ÄÇÂ§è‰∫îÊúàÂ£¨ÂØÖÊúîÔºåÂπ∏ÁÇ≠Â±±Ê∏ÖÊöë„ÄÇÂπΩÁöáÂ§™Â¶ÉËÉ°Ëæá‰∫éÊÄÄÂ∑ûÔºåÂõöÂ§´‰∫∫Â§∑Êáí‰∫éÂçó‰∫¨ÔºåÈ¶ÄÂÖöÁöÜÁîüÁòó‰πã......‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫îÂπ¥Êò•Ê≠£ÊúàÔºåÂª∫‰∏≠‰∫¨......ÂÖ≠ÊúàÔºåËµêÁöáÂ§™Â¶ÉËÉ°ËæáÊ≠ª‰∫éÂπΩÊâÄ„ÄÇ She was one of the Xiao sisters, and the older sister of Lady Xiao and Xiao Yanyan.

Many creative collectives of the country, educational institutions are staffed with graduates of the conservatory. Pupils of the conservatory work in professional collectives from near and far abroad such as in Russia, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Israel, USA, France, Czech Republic, Canada, Korea, China and others.  History  On 24 July 1944, the Council of People's Commissars of the Kazakh SSR decided to organize from October 1 the State Institute of Arts in the city of Alma-Ata, which was later transformed into the Alma-Ata Conservatory. In 1945, the university was named after the Kazakh kuishi of the 19th century Kurmangazy Sagyrbaev. In the first building, built in 1938, before the conservatory there was a musical and choreographic combine. In the early 1960's, another building and a dormitory with 120 living rooms, 42 rehearsals, reading and sports halls and a spacious hall was built. In the 1981‚Äì1982 academic year, more than 1200 students studied at the conservatory, 234 teachers worked, including over 20 professors and doctors of sciences, about 50 associate professors and candidates of sciences, 5 people's artists of the Soviet Union, 7 people's artists of the Kazakh SSR. In November 2000, the conservatory was provided with an additional modern 4-story building.  Faculties and departments  The institution is provided by 4 faculties: * Faculty of Vocal and Conducting * Faculty of instrumental performance * Faculty of Musicology and Management * Folk Music Faculty There are also a number of university-wide departments: * Department of Innovative Musical and Pedagogical Technologies * Department of Social and Humanitarian Disciplines * Experimental Art Studio School * Physical Education and Sports Section * Section of Kazakh and foreign languages  Building architecture  The building is an example of the \\"national style\\" in 1930's Almaty architecture. The 3-story building of the conservatory is an open rectangle in the plan. The main facade of the building is accented by flanking projections with two- column Corinthian-style porticoes, completed with a triangular pediment, with the main entrance located in one of them. The measured rhythm of Corinthian pilasters in the space between windows dissects the facade vertically. The windows are three-part, in the end part of the risalits - double-leaf. The masonry of the walls is brick, plastered. The layout of the building is of a corridor type with rooms overlooking it. = Memorial status = On 10 November 2010, a new State List of Historical and Cultural Monuments of the Local Significance of the city of Almaty was approved, simultaneously with which all previous decisions on this matter were declared invalid. In this Resolution, the status of a local monument of the building of the Kazakh National Conservatory was preserved. The boundaries of the protected zones were approved in 2014.

Regio III took its name from the double sanctuary of Isis and Serapis, in the area of the Via Praenestina, containing the valley that was to be the future site of the Colosseum, and parts of the Oppian and Esquiline hills. Geographic extent and important features Centred on the Oppian Hill, Regio III was bordered to its south east by the Via Tusculana, to the north by the Clivus Suburanus, and to the west by the Via Labicana. A measurement taken at the end of the 4th century recorded that the perimeter of the region was 12,350 Roman feet (approximately 3.65km).Notitia, REGIO III ISIS ET SERAPIS Drawing of the ruins of the Baths of Trajan (1575) Perhaps the most noticeable structure that resided within Regio III sat in the valley between the Caelian and Oppian Hills. This was the Flavian Amphitheatre, today referred to as the Colosseum. The most important ancient festival held there was the Secular games hosted by the Roman emperor Philip in 248 CE, celebrating the 1000 year anniversary of the foundation of Rome.Gregorovius, pg. 31 The remains of the Baths of Trajan Positioned immediately adjacent to the north of the Colosseum were the Baths of Titus and the enormous Baths of Trajan, the former built over a part of Nero‚Äôs Domus Aurea, the latter dominating the Oppian Hill and its ruins are still visible in modern Rome. Nevertheless, the most important buildings to the ancient Romans within this region were the double temple of Isis and Serapis, neither of which are extant today. This fate also befell the Moneta, the imperial mint that stood nearby. Also destroyed (though the foundations are still visible) is the Ludus Magnus (also known as the Great Gladiatorial Training School), the largest of the four gladiator training schools (ludi) in Ancient Rome built by the emperor Domitian, as well as the Ludus Dacicus, sited on the lower northern slopes of the Caelian Hill.Gregorovius, pg. 32 Alongside these buildings was the \\"Castra Misenatium\\". Here, marines specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at Misenum were housed and were employed to work the velarium at the Colosseum. Finally, the northern limits of Regio III contained the site of the Porticus of Livia, built by the emperor Augustus on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio in 15 BCE, and finished and dedicated to his wife Livia in 7 BCE. At the turn of the 5th century, the Regio contained 12 aediculae (shrines), 160 dom≈´s (patrician houses), 18 horrea (warehouses), 80 balneae (bath houses) and 65 loci (fountains).Notitia, REGIO III ISIS ET SERAPIS Subdivisions At the turn of the 5th century, the Regio was divided into 12 vici (districts) and 2,757 insulae (blocks).

In 1916, at the age of 6, he traveled with his father to Seattle, Washington, where he would live with his uncle even as his father returned to China six years later. John Wong befriended Arthur Chin after moving to Portland, Oregon, where they both enrolled in a Chinese-American- established flight school with tuition costs and expenses paid-for by donations from the Chinese-American community for the promise to join the Chinese military in the looming war against the Empire of Japan at the time. John Wong received his U.S. civilian pilot's license in April of 1932, traveling to China to join the Guangdong Provincial Air Force under General Chen Jitang, and was then sent to Germany along with other native Chinese and Chinese-American volunteer pilots by the Guangdong government, including Arthur Chin, for advanced aerial gunnery training with the Luftwaffe at Lagerlechfeld Air Base in southern Germany. Upon the airmen's return to China, the provincial and warlord air forces have become absorbed into the central Chinese Air Force, and thus Wong was assigned to 17th Pursuit Squadron of the central government's 3rd Pursuit Group as the squadron commander, flying the Boeing P-26 Model 281, and to be stationed at Chuyung Air Base.{{Cite weburl=http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_wong1.htmhttps://acesofww2.com/china/aces/wong/ See also * Louie Yim-qun References Category:Republic of China Air Force personnel Category:Chinese aviators Category:Chinese World War II flying aces Category:1910 births ","title":"John Wong Pan-yang"},{"id":"65421619","text":"Elliot Soto (born August 21, 1989) is an American professional baseball infielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB).

Completed in 1908, the building was designed by architect Arthur Griffin, who was also responsible for the nearby Carnegie library. In 1989, the Renton building was granted historic place category 2 status by Heritage New Zealand. Context The Coach and Horses Hotel, which stood on the corner of Hamilton and Tancred Streets in Hokitika, was purchased by blacksmith James Renton in the 1870s. He used the ground floor for his business, Renton and Company, which expanded to encompass ironmongery and the importing and retailing of general merchandise. The upper floor of the former hotel became family accommodation. As the business grew, Renton and Co. purchased serveral adjacent properties, and in 1898 James Renton passed the ownership of the company to his six sons, while retaining a managerial role. In February 1906, the firm announced its intention to replace their existing premises with a new, larger building in brick to meet the needs of their expanding business. Architecture Young Nelson-based architect Arthur Griffin was engaged to design the new building. Griffin, then aged 22, had recently won a competition for the design of the new Carnegie library in Hokitika on a site directly across the street. Tenders for the construction of the new Renton building were called for in June 1907, and construction was completed by local contractors Stevenson and McMillan the following year. As the new shop and warehouse was nearing completion in January 1908, the West Coast Times described the new building as \\"assuming imposing propoortions, and when finished will be classed amongst the finest business premises on the West Coast\\". The two-storey plastered brick building, rectangular in plan, was designed in neoclassical style, although much more utilitarian and less ornamented than Griffin's recently completed library nearby. However, it shared the distinctive semi-circular arch-head windows with central keystones with the Carnegie library, while the exterior cornices of the Renton building were simpler and lacked the classical dentils of those of the library. Current status In 1945, the company became known as the Renton Hardware Company Limited, and in 1989, the Renton Hardware building received historic place category 2 classification by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand). The property was still owned by the Renton family in 2015, when they sought a resource consent from Westland District Council to demolish the building as part of a proposed sale to Griffen and Smith Mitre 10, conditional on the resource consent being granted to make way for a car park. A seismic assessment by a structural engineer, submitted during the resource consent process, rated the building's structural strength as 10 per cent of the current new building standard and estimated that remediation could cost up to $1 million. After hearings by an independent commissioner, the resource consent was granted. An appeal was taken to the Environment Court by objectors, and an agreement was reached in August 2016 between the Renton family interests and the appellants for the latter to purchase the building with the intention of preserving it as part of a proposed heritage precinct. The new owners obtained their own seismic assessment of the building, putting it at 40 per cent of new building strength. They renamed the building the Okitiki building (Okitiki being a corruption of the name Hokitika used by early European settlers), and undertook work to waterproof and insulate the roof, stiffen the parapets, replace the roof cladding and replace the verandah, bringing the building to 67 per cent of new building strength.

Produced during Murakami's so-called \\"bodily fluids\\" period, the statue depicts an anime-inspired figure ejaculating a large strand of semen. Like its companion piece Hiropon, My Lonesome Cowboy is an example of superflat art, an art movement founded by Murakami in the 1990s to criticize Japanese consumer culture. The sculpture is noted as among Murakami's most famous works. Description My Lonesome Cowboy is an sculpture depicting a smiling nude anime-inspired male figure with spiked hair. The figure's legs are spread, and he is gripping his large erect penis, which is ejaculating semen that circles around his body like a lasso. Both My Lonesome Cowboy and its earlier companion piece Hiropon were produced during Murakami's so-called \\"bodily fluids\\" phase in the late 1990s, in which he depicted highly sexualized figures inspired by otaku culture. The sculpture is evocative of shunga (a type of historic erotic ukiyo-e which often depicted figures with exaggerated genitalia) and hentai (anime and manga pornography). Murakami hired commercial manufacturers to produce the sculpture in order to maintain fidelity to its otaku source material. My Lonesome Cowboy is an example of superflat art, an art movement founded by Murakami in the 1990s to criticize Japanese consumer culture. Its title is a dual reference: first to the 1968 Andy Warhol film Lonesome Cowboys, in regards to the pop art movement the film belonged to that was similarly influenced by consumer culture. It additionally references the 1957 film Loving You, in which Elvis Presley performs the song \\"Lonesome Cowboy\\" in a pose that similarly emphasizes his thighs and pelvis. Casts Murakami produced three casts plus two artist's proofs of My Lonesome Cowboy, with the hair of the figure being of different colors in each of the casts. In 2008, the fourth numbered edition of My Lonesome Cowboy sold at an auction by Sotheby's for USD$15.1 million, nearly four times the amount at which it was valued. At the time, the sale made Murakami one of the most expensive living artists in the world. Reception My Lonesome Cowboy is noted as among Murakami's most famous works. New York Times art critic Roberta Smith wrote that both it and Hiropon \\"mesmerize through an unsettling combination of innocence, carnal knowledge, beauty, exquisite artifice and arrested movement\\", though argued that My Lonesome Cowboy is \\"simplistically macho\\" compared to the more \\"nuanced\\" Hiropon. She nonetheless assesses both pieces favorably, arguing \\"after their shock value has declined, as all shock value must, they are still interesting to look at\\", arguing that both pieces are more successful than the erotic sculptures of Jeff Koons and Allen Jones. Art scholar Grace McQuilten is more critical of the piece, calling it \\"cute and colourful enough to appeal to a general audience at the same time as carrying off a semblance of social critique\\", arguing that it merely \\"reproduce[s] a popular fetish\\" and does not \\"challenge or modify the otaku stereotype\\".

This Film was based on the life of a cow protector. Synopsis Harphool Singh was a British Soldier born in a village Julani near Jind in 1892. His father died during his childhood. He was tortured and locked up by the police, but released after some time. He joined the British Army where he served for ten years and took part in the First World War. When he returned to his village, he murdered the police officer who illegally arrested and tortured him. Then he returned to his home to learn that his mother had passed away. Harphool believes that his mother was tortured and murdered by his stepbrothers, so he left home to start serving as a cow protector. A famous Haryanavi Ragni sung by Azad Khanda tells the story of Harphool Singh Jaat Julani. He was hanged by the police in 1936 in Firozpur Jail.

Produced during Murakami's so-called \\"bodily fluids\\" period, the 7.33 ft (223.5 cm) tall statue depicts an anime-inspired figure expelling streams of breast milk from her nipples. Like its companion piece My Lonesome Cowboy, it is an example of superflat art, an art movement founded by Murakami in the 1990s to criticize Japanese consumer culture. Description Hiropon is an approximately seven-foot tall sculpture depicting a nude anime-inspired woman with exaggerated breasts and nipples wearing a bikini top. Her hands are clutching her nipples, which are expelling streams of breast milk that circle her body to join into a skipping rope-like shape. The sculpture is inspired by otaku culture (enthusiasts, particularly of anime and manga) and lolicon (the fetishization of young-looking girls), Murakami has stated that he was an otaku as a teenager, and that Hiropon was influenced by fantasy and erotica elements in anime and manga. Like its companion piece My Lonesome Cowboy, Hiropon is an example of superflat art, a movement so named for pieces that \\"flatten\\" high and low culture. The sculpture is specifically intended as a critique of the culture of post-occupation Japan, with Murakami arguing that the country's secondary status to the United States led to an initialization of Japanese aesthetics and politics, \\"implod[ing] into fantasies of monsters and superheroes, galactic wars, cyborgs, and schoolgirls.\\" The title of the sculpture references the Japanese term for methamphetamine, with Murakami depicting otaku culture as a form of similarly illicit entertainment. Casts Murakami produced three casts plus one artist's proof of Hiropon, with the hair color and bikini top of the figure differing in each of the casts. A cast of Hiropon sold at an auction in 2002 for USD$427,500. Reception New York Times art critic Roberta Smith wrote that both Hiropon and My Lonesome Cowboy \\"mesmerize through an unsettling combination of innocence, carnal knowledge, beauty, exquisite artifice and arrested movement,\\" noting Hiropon as \\"especially good\\" compared to the \\"simplistically macho\\" My Lonesome Cowboy. She nonetheless assessed both pieces favorably, arguing \\"after their shock value has declined, as all shock value must, they are still interesting to look at,\\" arguing that both pieces are more successful that the erotic sculptures of Jeff Koons and Allen Jones. Art scholar Grace McQuilten is more critical of the piece, aruging that it \\"was not created as a critique of the way women are represented in otaku culture. Instead, it directly appeals to the market.\\" References Category:1997 sculptures Category:Japanese contemporary art Category:Pop art Category:Sculptures of women Category:Nude sculptures ","title":"Hiropon (sculpture)"},{"id":"65422148","text":"This is an incomplete list of notable alumni of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. * Abul Hayat, National Film Award winning actor from Bangladesh and civil engineer, recipient of the Ekushey Padak in the year 2015 which is the second-highest state award given by the Government of Bangladesh * Abul Hossain, an army Major General, former Director-General of BGB, former Engineer-in-Chief of the Bangladesh Army and former commandant of the Military Institute of Science and Technology * Ainun Nishat, academic, hydrology and climate change specialist * Alee Murtuza, former vice-chancellor of this university and renowned civil engineer * Anisul Hoque, writer, novelist, journalist * Aupee Karim, National Film Award winning Bangladeshi actress, model and faculty member at architecture school of American International University-Bangladesh * A.K.M.

Meggs is known for signing the Beatles to their first distribution contract in the United States. He started the music magazine TeenSet for Capitol in 1964, and founded Seraphim Records, a bargain label for classical music. After serving Capitol as chief operating officer for two years, he resigned in 1976 to concentrate on his writing. Capitol enticed him back in 1984 as the president of Angel Records; he revived the label for the digital age. As a writer, he won Best Documentary from the Cowboy Hall of Fame for the 1962 documentary film Appaloosa, and he was nominated for the Edgar Award for his mystery novel Saturday Games (1974). Early life and career Meggs was born in Los Angeles to Canadian-born painter and art director Charles Winfield Meggs and Margarette Brown Meggs. The Meggs line was originally English, settling along the Saint Lawrence River. His maternal ancestry was from Dutch immigrants to America who helped build the Erie Canal. His maternal grandparents were F. L. Moore of Los Angeles and Edward George Brown of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. His paternal grandfather was William E. Meggs of Gananoque, Ontario, Canada. Meggs had three younger sisters: Toby Winfield Meggs, Margarette \\"Peggy\\" Brown Meggs and Victoria \\"Vicky\\" McLaughlin Meggs. Meggs' father took film scripts home from Paramount Pictures to evaluate them with regard to art direction, and Meggs eagerly read the scripts, preferring them to books. He wanted to be a scriptwriter, though he also played French horn and loved classical music. He attended two private schools: first Black-Foxe Military Institute in Hollywood, then St. Luke's in Connecticut. He took college courses at California Institute of Technology and Harvard University, graduating in English. During the Korean War he served with the U.S. Army in counterintelligence, stationed for a year in Japan. After the war, Meggs lived in Laguna Beach, writing freelance for magazines. Meggs married Vassar- educated Boston socialite Nancy Bates Meachen on June 16, 1954, in the Old South Church of Boston, with a reception at the Algonquin Club; they took a road trip across the continent for their honeymoon, to make their home in Pasadena. They moved to Detroit by 1956 so Meggs could write industrial film scripts for the Jam Handy Organization. The couple had one son there, Brook Meachen Meggs, born on October 9, 1956. Capitol Records Meggs joined Capitol Records, a subsidiary of EMI Records, in September 1958 as a manager of merchandising and promotion at the Los Angeles Capitol Records Building. In 1959 he was director of public relations, handling Capitol artists, and also EMI artists visiting from the UK. In March 1962, Capitol moved Meggs to New York City, and nine months later he rose to the position of director of operations for the U.S. East Coast, coordinating with his West Coast counterpart, Fred Martin. His preference for music was in the opera and classical genres, and he reorganized Angel Records, Capitol's classical imprint, for better profitability. Meggs signed an agreement between Angel and the Soviet label Melodiya, which allowed Angel to sell recordings of Soviet artists such as pianist Sviatoslav Richter and conductor Kirill Kondrashin. Meggs signed the Beatles to an American distribution deal In early November 1963, Meggs met with Beatles manager Brian Epstein, who played him a demo copy of the single, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", recorded a few weeks earlier in London. Epstein had previously attempted to get the Beatles signed by Capitol, but the songs \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"She Loves You\\" were not considered good enough by Capitol's Dave Dexter Jr., in charge of reviewing \\"foreign\\" recordings. Meanwhile, Beatles contract holder EMI had been insisting to Capitol head Alan W. Livingston that he accept the band's next song. With this pressure in mind, Meggs listened to the intentional American gospel elements of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and predicted mass appeal; he immediately signed the Beatles to a major distribution deal. He promised Epstein that Capitol would mount a $40,000 promotional campaign in the states. Meggs discovered in early December that the UK single had amassed one million advance orders before it was released there on November 29. This meant that Capitol could expect much larger sales for their scheduled January 13 release. Capitol was faced with a new problem on December 17: a British copy of the single had been flown over the Atlantic to deejay Carroll James of WWDC in Maryland (serving Washington D.C.) who started broadcasting the song, stimulating demand. Other radio stations followed suit, obtaining their own copies by jet airliner. Capitol scrambled to advance the song's release date from January 13 to December 26, and to change the planned pressing from 200,000 to one million. Meggs rolled out the promotional slogan, \\"The Beatles are coming!\\", on advertisements (left) and stickers. Meggs hatched an unusual marketing idea: cover the country with warnings that \\"The Beatles Are Coming!\\", recalling Paul Revere's invented shout, \\"The British are coming!\\"Note that Paul Revere's notional shout \\"The British are coming!\\" is a fabrication. His famous ride was conducted in discreet silence because of squads of British troops hiding near roads. See \\"10 Things You May Not Know About Paul Revere\\" at History.com. In late December, Capitol paid for a small advertisement in Billboard magazine with the words \\"The Beatles Are Coming!\\" and a black mop-top haircut. Mop-top wigs were given to Capitol staff to wear. In early January 1964, the label distributed many thousands of stickers carrying the slogan \\"The Beatles Are Coming!\\" and four mop-top silhouettes in reddish ink, given free to retail sales staff, radio station staff, high school students; anybody who would plaster them around their area. By February 1, 1964, the song reached number 1 in the US, one week before the Beatles appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. Beatlemania had arrived in America. Music journalist Fred Bronson wrote retrospectively about \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", saying, \\"Next to 'Rock Around the Clock', it is the most significant single of the rock era, permanently changing the course of music.\\" Meggs and Fred Martin arranged the Beatles' transportation, lodging, security and schedule in February 1964 during their first visit to New York City and Miami. On the way to John F. Kennedy International Airport to greet the band, Meggs studied the cover of the recently released album Meet the Beatles! upon which his secretary, Stacy Caraviotis, had pasted the name of each band member under the proper photograph, so that Meggs could recognize and address the Beatles by name. Meggs rode in the limousine with the Beatles, and accompanied them to press conferences. Meggs and Paul McCartney got on well together; in 1974 McCartney's Black Lab bore a litter of seven mixed-breed puppies, and he named one Brown Meggs. Meggs took the Beatles melody of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and composed a French horn solo piece titled \\"Variations on 'Komm, gib mir deine Hand'\\", which he performed in the classical style in a New York concert.\\"Happy Occasion\\", Music Business, IX (2), p. 30. August 15, 1964. Meggs conceived the idea of promoting Capitol artist the Beach Boys by way of a fan club magazine. He began the project in March 1964, announcing the fan club formation, and in October 1964 the first issue of The Teen Set magazine was provided as a free insert to the live album Beach Boys Concert. Meggs was the chief editor. Helping Meggs get the right mix was veteran teen magazine journalist and photographer Earl Leaf, serving as guest editor. Issue number two was published in March 1965, printed in a huge run of 500,000. Meggs told Billboard magazine that it was \\"the largest teen-oriented advertising- merchandising campaign in the history of CRDC [Capitol Records Distribution Company].\\" The first issue had been devoted to the Beach Boys exclusively, but the second issue also carried stories about Capitol artists Donna Loren, Bobby Rydell, Peter & Gordon and the Beatles. By November 1965, Meggs had replaced himself as editor with 25-year-old Judith Sims, who understood her readership and took TeenSet into new territory, forming it into one of the best teen magazines of the 1960s. Capitol promoted Meggs to vice president of CRDC in 1964, in charge of merchandising, advertising and public relations, returning to the Hollywood offices, where he started on August 1. Meggs was one of three vice presidents of CRDC, reporting to President Stan Gortikov. Meggs immediately canceled Capitol's two conflicting contracts for advertising agencies, split between east and west coast rivalries, and hired Foote, Cone & Belding to cover all of Capitol's advertising needs.\\"In the Trade\\", Music Business, IX (2), p. 31. August 15, 1964. Meggs founded Seraphim Records in September 1966, to promote high-quality recordings of classical music, sold at bargain prices. Seraphim remastered and re-issued classic recordings by famous artists of EMI such as composer-conductor Paul Hindemith and pianist Myra Hess. Seraphim also drew from unsold stock of other labels, primarily Angel Records, to give the titles another chance at a lower price. Meggs used the slogan, \\"Champagne at beer prices.\\" Graphic artist John Van Hamersveld showed this poster to Meggs and was hired. In 1967, Meggs hired graphic artist John Van Hamersveld on the strength of his artwork for the surfer film poster The Endless Summer. Hamersveld recalled that the first thing Meggs said to him was, \\"You are going to take this job and you can‚Äôt turn it down.\\" Meggs made Hamersveld his personal art director for Capitol; in that role Hamersveld created the covers for the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour, the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St., Skeletons from the Closet: The Best of Grateful Dead and many more. In 1971, Meggs was promoted to worldwide marketing while still covering his old responsibilities in classical. He streamlined the sales side by cutting away one layer of management, removing four division manager positions. Capitol promoted him to chief operating officer in 1974, reporting to CEO Bhaskar Menon. In July 1976, Meggs resigned as COO of Capitol. He said, \\"It occurred to me that I didn't like to go to my office in the morning... I realized there were other things I wanted to do.\\" His writing career had been secondary, and now he wanted to make it primary. He explained, \\"I've seen so many people come to bad ends staying with a career. If you do have personal goals and you're not moving toward them at an acceptable rate, there's no substitute for taking the gamble.\\" Capitol appealed to Meggs in 1984, asking him to return and focus solely on the classical side ‚Äì his favorite aspect. He accepted the position of president of Angel Records, with more autonomy as a separate division of Capitol. Meggs revived the label by reissuing its titles on Compact Disc. He also reworked Seraphim Records by stopping all vinyl pressings, the bargain titles released only on Compact Cassette. Mid-priced lines were to be released on cassette and CD. Meggs left Capitol for the last time in 1990 after his wife was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. During his years at Capitol Records, Meggs worked most closely with pop artists such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Band, Helen Reddy, Grand Funk Railroad, Steve Miller Band, Linda Ronstadt, Bobbie Gentry, and Leo Kottke. Despite his skill in the pop world, he preferred classical and opera music. Brook Meggs said in 1997 that his father liked the music of Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell well enough, \\"and he certainly recognized the Beatles' talent. But from the time he was a kid, classical music was it for him.\\" Author Meggs wrote several non-fiction articles for magazines such as Esquire, True, and McCall's. In 1958, Meggs published an article about English race car driver Richard Seaman who drove for Mercedes Benz. Seaman won the 1938 German Grand Prix but crashed and died the next year. Meggs' account appeared in the book Omnibus of Speed; a collection of short biographical pieces on race car drivers. Sponsored by the Appaloosa Horse Club of Moscow, Idaho, Meggs wrote the script for the documentary film Appaloosa, narrated by television actor Dale Robertson, and shot in Idaho in 1961. Meggs co-directed the 30-minute color film with producer Fred Rice. It was named the best documentary in 1962 by the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center. The filmmakers each received a bronze statuette representing the Charles M. Russell painting Wrangler. Meggs' 1974 book Saturday Games was nominated for the Edgar Allan Poe Awards in the category of Best First Novel, which was won in 1975 by Gregory Mcdonald for Fletch. Saturday Games was a crime mystery: its plot had three bachelor playboys implicated in the death of a free-spirited woman they had all known, and a police detective trying to find the truth. Meggs had first submitted the book to mystery editor Barbara Norville of Bobbs-Merrill Company, but she returned the manuscript with suggestions for improvement. Meggs reworked the book and published through Random House for more money. Meggs based his novel Aria on soprano Maria Callas His 1978 novel Aria revealed the inner workings of the classical record company in their struggle to produce a recording of Giuseppe Verdi's Otello. The New York Times called it \\"required reading\\" for anyone contemplating the record industry. The story is based in part on the debacle of Maria Callas attempting to record La traviata for EMI for more than a decade, the project finally canceling after Aristotle Onassis stopped funding it in 1968 when he left Callas for Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy. Originally published in French in 1985. Translated into English by John W. N. Francis. In 1981, Meggs wrote a historic novel, The War Train, about American soldiers enduring a hellish train ride in March 1916 to Hachita, New Mexico, intending to cross the border and fight Pancho Villa in Mexico. Meggs took the kernel of the story from tales told by his step-grandfather who had been on the train. By studying microfilm records of the cavalry unit, Meggs confirmed the facts of the narrative. A film based on the book was being considered by Mace Neufeld, but the project was ultimately dropped. The Detroit Free Press reviewed The War Train positively except for the mistake of positioning Ty Cobb as shortstop rather than outfielder. In 1986, Meggs wrote Two Fathers' Justice, a television drama film about two fathers reacting to the deaths of their son and daughter, and seeking justice. Meggs co-wrote the sequel, Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent (1994).MSN Entertainment - Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent, Cast & Crew Personal life In 1959 or 1960, Meggs' parents moved to Grass Valley, California, where his mother served on the city council. She ran for state senator in 1964 as the \\"fighting grandma\\" or \\"battling grandmother\\" candidate but lost to Paul J. Lunardi. Meggs played French horn from his school days. In 1964, he obtained a rare French horn from master builder Herbert Fritz Knopf, instrument maker in Markneukirchen, Saxony, East Germany. Though Knopf was behind the Iron Curtain, Meggs' contacts with Melodiya helped convey the four-valve, B-flat instrument out from under Soviet Union control. Meggs first lived with his wife in Pasadena, then Detroit, returning to Greater Los Angeles, then New York City in 1962, moving to La Ca√±ada, California, in July 1964. By 1976, the Meggs were back in Pasadena in the hills west of the Rose Bowl Stadium, in a home designed by and for architect Roland Logan Russell in 1961. The hexagonal-plan home, organized around a central atrium, has been featured as an outstanding example of mid- century modern architecture. It was listed for sale in 2017 at $3.3 million. Meggs' wife Nancy died in 1990 of pancreatic cancer. He moved to an apartment in the Russian Hill neighborhood of San Francisco where he died in 1997 from a brain hemorrhage. Their singer-songwriter son, Brook, lived in California, New York and Texas, but after his father died, he moved to Sudbury, Massachusetts, where his mother had been raised. Much of the historic Meachen family property, of farmland known as the Meachen-Meggs parcel, was sold to the city in 1999 for $3.5 million to be held in public trust for conservation purposes. It is now called Poor Farm Meadows Conservation Land.Sudbury, Massachusetts: 1639‚Äì1999. 1999 Annual Town Report.

It is dedicated to Saint Nicholas. History The city‚Äôs oldest church, it replaced an earlier one that burned. For some four decades, the local Orthodox used churches in neighboring villages, as the Protestant and Catholic authorities of the Principality of Transylvania refused to approve a new one. Finally, the community appealed to Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu, Prince of Wallachia, known for his piety. The latter wrote on their behalf to Michael I Apafi, Prince of Transylvania. Michael agreed on certain conditions: the walls were to be neither too thick nor too high, and were not to obstruct the view of the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Citadel. Moreover, the Reformed Church was to continue its supervision of Orthodox priests in the city.‚ÄúCtitoria domnitorului Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu din FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü‚Äù, BunƒÉ ziua Bra»ôov, September 21, 2013 Above the door, a Romanian Cyrillic inscription features the Wallachian coat of arms, mentions that Br√¢ncoveanu was the ktetor and a construction date of 1698. In 1723, the church was confiscated and handed over to the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, again forcing the local Orthodox to seek other places of worship. For the next fourteen years, it served two bishops as their cathedral: Ioan Giurgiu Patachi and Inocen»õiu Micu-Klein. In 1737, the latter moved the church headquarters to Blaj, and St. Nicholas became a parish church. In 1948, when the new Communist regime outlawed the Greek Catholic Church, the building was transferred to Orthodox control. Repairs took place in 1994-1998, bringing to light the paintings that had been blackened over time. Description Porch with octagonal columns The unknown architect was likely trained at Horezu Monastery. The church features the Br√¢ncovenesc style. Its characteristic decoration appears in two rows on the facade, as well as in two cornices beneath the roof; these are done in unpainted brick. The open porch is surrounded by ten octagonal columns. The bell tower, above the nave, is also octagonal. There are three spires, made of brick and semi-spherical. Also typical of the Br√¢ncovenesc style are the seven windows with frames of carved stone, and the door frame, which preserves the original form. The iconostasis is original, carved out of oak in the same Br√¢ncovenesc manner, then gilt. Inscriptions indicate that the painter came from C√¢mpulung. The iconostasis is the largest surviving Br√¢ncovenesc example, considerably larger than at Horezu or the T√¢rgovi»ôte Princely Church. The altar and nave are painted in fresco, closely adhering to the rules of Byzantine iconography. The vestibule was painted much later by an unknown artist, and is considerably less valuable. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

There were about 300 to 400 coins in the hoard when local antiquary Anatole de Charmasse saw them in 1873, identified 55 types, took down legends and drew sketches. They have since been dispersed. Most recently, Jean Lafaurie has identified 76 coins from the hoard: 75 Merovingian tremisses and one Arab-Byzantine dƒ´nƒÅr from Damascus. Eleven of the coins came from the mint of Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne and the latest datable Merovingian issue was struck in the name of Chlothar II at Marseille between 612 and 629. Pierre Le Gentilhomme, who first published the find in 1938, concluded that it was most likely deposited in the 640s, based on the sequence of moneyers from Chalon. It may have been buried in connection with the battle of Autun and the death of Willibad in September 642 or 643, since according to the Chronicle of Fredegar this was followed by much unrest and plundering. The Arab-Byzantine dƒ´nƒÅr has a high-resolution colour photograph (no. 5). first appeared on the market in 1862. According to Henri Lavoix's catalogue of 1887, it was found with two Merovingian coins. It portrays the emperors Heraclius, Constantine III and Heraclonas on the obverse and bears the shahƒÅda on the reverse. If dated to shortly before 693, when a new coinage was introduced by the Caliph  øAbd al-Malik ibn MarwƒÅn, it is inconsistent with the rest of the Buis hoard. Lafaurie suggested the very early date of 636‚Äì641, contemporary with the emperors depicted. Clive Foss suggests that the dƒ´nƒÅr, which bears no Christian symbol, is among the issues of the Caliph Mu øƒÅwiya I that were rejected as tribute by the Emperor Constans II in 659., based on the account of the contemporary Maronite Chronicle. While it was certainly found not far from Buis, Philip Grierson argued that it could not have belonged to the Buis hoard. Michael McCormick also regards it as a stray find. It is today the \\"only Arab-Byzantine gold coin to have been found outside the Levant\\". The tremisses of the hoard are mostly from the kingdom of Burgundy. The representation of mints along the Rh√¥ne, Sa√¥ne and Meuse rivers reflects Buis's place along the trade route connecting the Mediterranean and the Rhine through eastern Francia. If the dƒ´nƒÅr can be attached to the hoard, it would show the link of this route with Syria.

Biography  He was the second son of the City Architect, Josef Willroider. His older brother, , was also a landscape painter. Like his brother, he began as a carpentry apprentice in his father's workshop before turning to art. He then received drawing lessons from his brother and the landscape painter, Jakob Canciani (1820‚Äì1891). In 1866, at the age of twenty-three, he left Villach to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. There, he received training from Eduard Schleich the Elder and, although he was not accepted into his classes, from Adolf Heinrich Lier. While there, he also took Carl Ebert as his mentor and accompanied him on painting trips. Originally from Stuttgart, Ebert was closely associated with the animal painters, Christian Mali and Anton Braith, and was one of the first in Germany to promote plein aire painting. Willroider was also able to take advantage of Ebert's studio spaces, offered to seven local painters, without charge. He was a regular participant in exhibitions at the Glaspalast, where he received numerous medals, honors and commendations. Later, he would exhibit throughout Germany. His favorite places to paint were in Upper Bavaria, especially around the Starnberger See, also in the Isar valley and Carpathia, in Viktring. After 1886, he expanded his travels to include South Tyrol and Northern Italy. In addition to his painting excursions, he made study trips to the Netherlands in the 1860s and 70s. In 1883, he was named an honorary member of the Academy in Munich. Three years later, he received the title of Professor from Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. After his retirement, he divided his time between Munich and the Starnberger See.

It occurred near Camden, South Carolina, on May 17, 1923, during a school play, killing seventy-seven people. Background The two-story school was located southeast of Camden, South Carolina, and served students at all grade levels. The school was constructed primarily out of wood and was lighted only with oil lamps. Two classrooms were located on the first floor, while an auditorium was located on the second floor. A single wooden stairway provided the only access to the second floor. The school was scheduled to close at the end of the 1922-1923 school year. The fire On May 17, 1923, the day the school was scheduled to close permanently, around 300 people were attending a play in the school's auditorium that took place after the annual graduation ceremony. The play was a short comedy called either Miss Topsy Turvy or Topsy Turvy. During the play's last act, an oil lamp fell from the wall, causing its contents to spill all over the stage and ignite. A group of men attempted to smother the flames with their coats but were unsuccessful. The fire eventually traveled up the stage's curtains and then spread rapidly across the ceiling, causing a panic. Spectators rushed towards the stairway to escape. However, many people were trampled to death at the door to the stairs because the door was so narrow. Others died of smoke inhalation before the flames could reach them. The spectators' excess weight also caused the stairway to collapse, trapping those inside on the second floor of the building. Many of these people survived by jumping out of the school's windows. The school was completely destroyed within an hour. Aftermath Seventy-seven people perished in the fire, including forty-one children and the father of future governor of South Carolina, John C. West. Only about one-quarter of the victims could be identified. Those that were not claimed by family members were buried in a mass grave at the Beulah Methodist Church Cemetery.

He specialized in winter scenes and forest views.  Biography  His father, Johann Jakob Salzer (1798‚Äì1879) came from Dettingen an der Erms to open a paint store, which eventually became a paint factory. He was born to his father's first wife, Elisabeth. After becoming a widower in 1860, his father married again, to the much younger Caroline Haas, who gave birth to his half- brother, , a publisher of evangelical literature. He initially worked in his father's paint factory, while taking lessons from a local artist named Karl Baumann. In 1846, upon Baumann's recommendation, he moved to Munich to continue his artistic training and began his studies with the Tyrolean painter, Joseph Anton Rhomberg, who had been a Professor in Munich since 1827. His circle of friends there included Carl Ebert, Richard Zimmermann, who influenced his style, and Alexander von Kotzebue, a battle painter for whom he provided some landscape backgrounds.Nekrologe. (obituary) In: Kunst-Chronik. 25. August 1876, pg. 738 (Online). In 1863, he returned to Heilbronn and married Emilie von Lobstein, with whom he had four sons. After his father's retirement, he took over management of the paint factory. That, coupled with increasingly poor health, left him little time for painting during the last decade of his life.

He joined the CNT in 1911, which led him to be fired from his job in 1915 for his militancy. He emigrated to Paris, where he remained until 1919. When he returned, he could not secure a job as he found himself on the employer's black list, so he moved to La Felguera where he taught in a rationalist school. In 1922 he returned to Gij√≥n, where he directed the newspaper Vida Obrera. In September 1925 he was elected General Secretary of the CNT, a post which he held until July 1926. He was replaced by Segundo Blanco, whom he had accompanied to the Congress of the Portugal CGT a year earlier. In 1926 he worked as a teacher at the Neutral School (), with the pedagogue Eleuterio Quintanilla. With the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, he was put in charge of directing the CNT's newspaper Solidaridad Obrera and until 1933 he was on the CNT Regional Committee in Madrid. He was became a member of the FAI and the Jovellanos Masonry Lodge. In 1934 he was one of the people in favor of the CNT's participation in the Workers' Alliance, and in 1935 he was commissioned to reorganize the Regional Committee of the CNT in Asturias. When the Spanish coup of July 1936 took place, he was one of the organizers of the Provincial Committee of the Popular Front of Asturias and represented the CNT in the Gij√≥n Defense Council. On October 15, 1936, he was elected Mayor of Gij√≥n, where a street bears his name today. When Franco's troops entered Gij√≥n in October 1937 he fled to Barcelona, where he remained until February 1938, when he was appointed special delegate of the General Council of International Anti-Fascist Solidarity and moved to the United States to raise aid for the Republican cause. After being received by Republican Ambassador Fernando de los R√≠os Urruti in Washington DC and organizing several rallies in New York City. He died in a car accident in Virginia on March 27, 1938, while he was traveling to California to take part in a series of propaganda actions in favor of republican Spain. He left a widow, Florentina Fern√°ndez and two children, Avelino and Amapola.

The nat festival in honour of the spirits of Shwe Kyunbin brother and sister is alive with the teeming crowd from upcountry annually.  Legend  According to oral tradition, the Shwe Kyunbin brother and sister were the grandchildren of the Saopha of Momeik, and became nats when they were pressed under the block of Tectona tree while they were playing near the Shweli River. Their names were Sao Nan Thwe (sister) and Sao Nan Aung (brother), and their ages of becoming nats are 15 and 13 years respectively. Their spirits accompanied the tree as it drifted downriver. When the tree landed near Momeik Mound, near Mingun, the local people tried to threw it back in the river. But the tree kept returning to the spot, and although the tree was decayed, it sprouted leaves. It came to Mingun's chief abbot in a dream that the tree was linked to the spirits of the two children, and a nat shrine was set up there in their honour.  Shrine  The shrine of Kyunbin nats is on the Sagaing-Mingun motor road, next to Momeik Mound, Mingun region. Next to the shrine is the huge tectona tree. It is said that, when the time come to bloom, the blossom of the tree always face towards the shrine. On the each side of the entry, there are Statue of Snake, for the sister to ride, and Statue of Tiger, for the brother to ride. There is another official rest-a-while shrine called Kondauk Nan of Kyunbin Nats at Taungbyone village.  Appanage  Kyunbin brother and sister possessed 12 alluvial lands, along the Mandalay and Sagaing banks of Ayeyarwady River, to venerate them. The 12 lands are Hsin Kyun, Daung Kyun, Thamingyan, Phaye Kyun, Dingar Kyun , Nattaw Kyun, Moegyoe Kyun, Yayle Kyun, Aye Kyun), Paukwe, Kyun Khin (1) and (2). Being Shan nats, they are also venerated by some Shan nat believers.  Festival programs or ritual setting  As Kyunbin Nat Festival is held earlier than other Nat Festivals, there is a saying that the Starter of the Nat Festivals is Shwe Kyunbin. The nat festival of Kyunbin is held three times a year: * Paying obeisance festival from the first to the sixth waxing days of Wagaung: ** 1st day ‚Äì Opening ceremony and meeting of nat royal council ** 2nd day ‚Äì The ritual shower ** 3rd day ‚Äì Swinging of nat statues ** 4th day ‚Äì Swinging of spirit mediums ** 5th day ‚Äì Going round the royal garden ** 6th day ‚Äì Cutting eugenia tree * Going to the battle front on the 13th and 14th waning days of Tabaung, and * Their return from the battle front on the 4th and 5th waxing days of Nayon.

Historical accounts =2nd-century usage by Celsus= In the 2nd century, Celsus, a Greek philosopher, wrote that Jesus's father was a Roman soldier named Panthera. The views of Celsus drew responses from Origen, who considered it a fabricated story. Celsus' claim is only known from Origen's reply. Origen writes: Raymond E. Brown states that the story of Panthera is a fanciful explanation of the birth of Jesus which includes very little historical evidence.Also cited and Celsus' wide-ranging criticism of Christianity included the assertions that Christians had forsaken the laws of their fathers, that their minds had been held captive by Jesus and that the teachings of Jesus included nothing new and were simply a repetition of the sayings of the Greek philosophers. Marcus J. Borg and John Dominic Crossan state that given the antagonism of Celsus towards Christianity, his suggestion of the Roman parentage of Jesus might derive from the memory of Roman military operations suppressing a revolt at Sepphoris near Nazareth around the time of Jesus' birth. The \\"common legionary name\\" Panthera could have arisen from a satirical connection between \\"Panther\\" and the Greek word \\"Parthenos\\" meaning virgin. =Jewish usage in the Middle Ages= The story that Jesus was the son of a man named Pantera is referred to in the Talmud, in which Jesus is widely understood to be the figure referred to as \\"Ben Stada\\": Peter Sch√§fer explains this passage as a commentary designed to clarify the multiple names used to refer to Jesus, concluding with the explanation that he was the son of his mother's lover \\"Pantera\\", but was known as \\"son of Stada\\", because this name was given to his mother, being \\"an epithet which derives from the Hebrew/Aramaic root sat.ah/sete' ('to deviate from the right path, to go astray, to be unfaithful'). In other words, his mother Miriam was also called 'Stada' because she was a sotah, a woman suspected, or rather convicted, of adultery.\\" A few of the references explicitly name Jesus (\\"Yeshu\\") as the \\"son of Pandera\\": these explicit connections are found in the Tosefta, the Qohelet Rabbah, and the Jerusalem Talmud, but not in the Babylonian Talmud. The book Toledot Yeshu, which dates to the Middle Ages and appeared in Aramaic as well as Hebrew as an anti-Christian satirical chronicle of Jesus, also refers to the name Pantera, or Pandera. The book accuses Jesus of illegitimate birth as the son of Pandera, and of heretical and at times violent activities along with his followers during his ministry. Throughout the centuries, both Christian and Jewish scholars have generally only paid minor attention to the Toledot Yeshu. Robert E. Van Voorst states that the literary origins of Toledot Yeshu cannot be traced with any certainty, and given that it is unlikely to go before the 4th century, it is far too late to include authentic remembrances of Jesus. The nature of the Toledot Yeshu as a parody of the Christian gospels is manifested by the claim that the Apostle Peter pretended to be Christian so he could separate them from the Jews and its portrayal of Judas Iscariot as a hero who posed as a disciple of Jesus in order to stop the Christians. Bruce Chilton and Craig A. Evans state that the Toledot Yeshu consists primarily of fictitious anti-Christian stories based on the ongoing friction with the Jews, and that it offers no value to historical research on Jesus. The Blackwell Companion to Jesus states that the Toledot Yeshu has no historical facts as such, and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity. However, the Jerusalem Talmud is far older, compiled in 200 CE (about the time of Celsus) and likely finished about 500 CE. =Ethiopian ecclesiastical literature= A soldier by the name of Pantos/Pantera also appears twice in Ethiopian church documents. In the First Book of Ethiopian Maccabees he is listed as one of three brothers who resists the Seleucid invasion of Judea. Within the text itself he is cited as receiving his name from the act of strangling panthers with his bare hands. This name and personage also appears in the text of the Ethiopian Synaxarion (Tahisas 25), where he is remembered along with his brothers in the canon of Ethiopian saints. Neither text makes any clear identification of this figure with the legendary accounts of the paternal ancestry of Christ.

It is one of the oldest theatres in Lisbon still in operation. Construction and opening In 1866, Francisco Pereira Palha de Faria de Lacerda, a writer and playwright, decided to build his own theatre, forming a joint-stock company of friends and investors, including the Duke of Palmela. The location of the Trindade area of the Chiado was chosen because of historical associations, as there had briefly been a theatre in the area in the 18th century when the Italian businessman, Alessandro Paghetti, had created the Academia da Trindade as Lisbon‚Äôs first popular opera theatre. Three other theatres were already in the Chiado when the Teatro da Trindade was built, the Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos, the D. Maria II National Theatre, and the Teatro Gin√°sio. Miguel Evaristo de Lima Pinto was chosen as the architect and the building he designed followed the Portuguese Pombaline style together with some influence of the Italian neoclassical style then in vogue. It was considered the most comfortable, elegant and technically advanced theatre in Lisbon of its time. There were originally two components, a theatre and a hall. The hall was demolished in 1921. The theatre has three facades. The main one faces the Largo da Trindade and is where the royal entrance was. It is decorated with medallions with the busts of the writers Ant√≥nio Ferreira (1528-1569), Dami√£o de G√≥is (1502‚Äì1574), and Francisco de S√° de Miranda (1481‚Äì1558), as well as a bust of Terpsichore the muse of dance. The hall (Sal√£o do Trindade) was opened in February 1867 for the Carnival and, on 30 November, the Teatro da Trindade opened. Its auditorium has a horseshoe shape. The seating in the stalls, consisting of mahogany chairs, was removable and the floor could be raised to the level of the stage, thus creating a ballroom. An innovation much appreciated by audiences was that chairs had a hook on the back so that the men could hang their hats. Trompe-l'oeil paintings on the ceiling, by Jos√© Proc√≥pio, show Portuguese theatrical personalities such as Gil Vicente, Ant√≥nio Jos√© da Silva, Almeida Garrett, Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, and Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage. The turn of the century After the death of Francisco Palha, in January 1890, the management of the Trindade passed through several hands before it was sold to Ant√≥nio Serr√£o Franco, who contracted an artistic society that appointed as director in 1894. Under Sousa Bastos, the resident company included performers such as Mercedes Blasco and Palmira Bastos. In 1901, management was taken over by Afonso Taveira, who was responsible for guiding the Trindade through the period of instability that included the regicide, the First Portuguese Republic and the beginning of World War I, until his death in 1916. Sale and remodelling On January 22, 1921, the Teatro da Trindade was sold to the Anglo-Portuguese Telephone Company, which wanted to install its offices there. The Sal√£o da Trindade was then totally demolished. A few months later an auction was held to sell all of the property of the theatre, including, furniture and props. The idea that the Teatro da Trindade would close caused indignation amongst the theatre-going public. Knowing that the telephone company did not need the theatre space, Jos√© Loureiro offered to buy the theatre, which was sold to him for ten thousand pounds sterling in 1923. Remodelling was then carried out. The size of the stage enabled the Trindade to put on variety performances that required a large cast. Theatrical groups to play there included the Am√©lia Rey Cola√ßo-Robles Monteiro company, the Portuguese Opera Company (CPO), the Comedians of Lisbon (Os Comediantes de Lisboa) run by Francisco Carlos Lopes Ribeiro and his brother Ant√≥nio and the Teatro Nacional Popular. From 1938 the Trindade was also used for short seasons of cinema. 1962 to the present In 1962 FNAT, the National Foundation for Happiness at Work (Funda√ß√£o Nacional para Alegria no Trabalho)), an organization promoted by Portugal‚Äôs authoritarian Estado Novo government, acquired the Teatro da Trindade. In 1967, remodelling work was carried out, under the direction of Maria Jos√© Salavisa, who chose the blue and gold interior decoration that remains today. In 1991, extensive renovation and restoration work was carried out on the entire building. New facilities were created for the administration and the stage, dressing rooms and service areas were refitted. The previous rehearsal room was converted into a studio room, which created a space for the presentation of experimental theatre. In 2009, the facades were restored, the roof was replaced and public areas were refitted. The theatre continues to be owned and operated by the successor organization to FNAT, known as the National Institute for the Use of Workers' Free Time (Instituto Nacional para o Aproveitamento dos Tempos Livres), or INATEL.

Describing about 75 different hemoglobin, he discovered the most number of hemoglobin types than anyone else. He is regarded as one of the founders of molecular anthropology.  Biography  Hermann Lehmann was born in Halle, eastern Germany. His father Paul Lehmann was publisher of two local newspaper. His mother Bella (n√©e Apelt) died when he was three years old. He had three sisters and one half-brother. He attended the state school at Halle for his elementary education. An economic depression, hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic, forced his father to abandon publication at Halle, and his family moved to Dresden in 1923. He completed secondary education at the Gymnasium zum heiligen Kreuz (now the Kreuzschule) in 1928. Soon after enrolling in a medical course at the University of Freiberg in Breisgau, his father died and moved to Frankfurt to live with his uncle and study there. In 1931, he entered Heidelberg University but before he complete the M.D. course, the rising anti-Semitism of Nazism compelled him to give up his final examination in 1933. Moving to Switzerland, he submitted his already finished thesis on gastric secretion titled Salzsaur√§produktion in Sauglingsmagen nach Histaminreiz. Beobachtet mittels fraktionerter Ausheberung to the University of Basel. The university awarded him an M.D. in January 1934, but without medical license since his medical course was in Germany. He was appointed as a research assistant to Otto Fritz Meyerhof (winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1922) at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Heidelberg. Meyerhof arranged for his visit to the University of Cambridge in 1935, where he met Frederick Gowland Hopkins, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929. Hopkins invited him to move to Cambridge, and it was anecdotally said: \\"Gowland Hopkins told him to leave his white coat hanging behind the door of the laboratory where it would be ready for him on his return!\\" The same year he attended a conference at Moscow, upon the return of which he was accused of attending the Trades Union Conference. As life got more difficult, he went back to England and get enrolled for a Ph.D. course in biochemistry at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1936. Joseph Needham and Dorothy Needham, a researcher couple at Hopkins' laboratory helped him get a grant for Jewish refugees and let him their house. Supervised by Joseph Needham, his thesis was on Aspects of carbohydrate metabolism in the absence of molecular oxygen. He received the degree two years later and immediately worked under the Beit Memorial Fellowships for Medical Research until 1942. As World War II advanced, classified as a \\"friendly alien\\", he was among the jewish refugees rounded up at Huyton in 1940. In October, he was released and volunteered himself in the work efforts. Charles Scott Sherrington, Nobel laurate and former President of the Royal Society, help him get a position in the Emergency Medical Service at Runwell Hospital in Essex. In 1942, he was recruited, again with help of Sherrington, in the Royal Army Medical Corps (R.A.M.C.) to investigate a rampant anaemia in the British Army in India. He was initially a pathologist, raised to Lieutenant Colonel and later appointed Assistant Director of pathology to the North East India Command. It was while working there that he received an application for naturalisation from a \\"certain Captain Lehmann, R.A.M.C.\\", to which he sent a full recommendation. His major woks in the biochemistry of blood originated there as he witnessed high incidence of iron deficiency among the Indian troops. As the war ended he was demobilised in the late 1946, and was appointed in 1947 as a Senior Nutrition Research Officer under Colonial Medical Research Fellowship at Makerere College (now Makerere University) in Kampala, Uganda. In 1949, he returned to England as Consultant Pathologist at the Pembury Hospital in Kent. He moved to St Bartholomew's Hospital in London as a Senior Lecturer in 1951 and worked there until 1963. He was appointed as a biochemist at the Addenbrooke‚Äôs Hospital of the University of Cambridge in 1963. The Medical Research Council established the Abnormal Haemoglobin Research Unit under his supervision that year under the university. He eventually became the first professor of clinical biochemistry in the university in 1967. Between 1963 and 1975 he was Honorary Director of the World Health Organization for the Abnormal Haemoglobin Research Unit. He retired from the university in 1977, and continued a research programme called the National Haemoglobin Reference Centre funded by WHO. In 1940, Lehmann married Benigna Norman-Butler, a musician, with whom he had two daughters, Susan and Ruth, and two sons, Paul and David.  Scientific contributions  Lehmann was a pioneer in the study of the chemistry of blood. One of his first major contributions was on the etiology of anaemia in Uganda. At the Makerere College, he found that anaemia in many Africans was due to parasitic worm infection, specifically hookworm infection. His next major work was the case of pseudocholinesterase deficiency, a deadly blood disease in which individuals have severe sensitivity to certain anesthetic drugs. While working at St Bartholomew's Hospital, he discovered that pseudocholinesterase deficiency is the cause of idiosyncratic hypersensitivity to suxamethonium. He developed biochemical test for the diagnosis, and also discovered the genetic basis of the disease. Lehmanns most important works were on the variants of haemoglobins. He discovered about 75 different types of haemoglobins during his career. His discoveries of haemoglobins related to blood diseases such as sickle cell disease are lasting important in medicine and biochemistry. He was credited as \\"more than anybody responsible for cataloguing the enormous wealth of variations in the hemoglobin mutants and setting our base of understanding of the population genetics, anthropology, and clinical diversity of the structural variants.\\"  Honours and awards  Lehmann received the Darwin's Prize for his Ph.D. thesis at Christ's College in 1938. He won the Rivers Memorial Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1961 for his studies of sickle cell disease in the Andaman Islands. He is regarded as one of the founders of molecular anthropology. He was elected a Fellow of the Christ's College in 1965, and became an honorary fellow in 1982. At Christ's College, he served as Fellows‚Äô Steward, editor of the college magazine, and president of the College Medical Society. The University of Cambridge conferred him the degree of D.Sc. in 1957. He was a honorary professor in the University of Freiburg in 1964. He received the Marin Luther King Prize for Research on Sickle-Cell Anaemia in 1971, Conway Evans Prize of the Royal Society and Royal College of Physicians in 1976, and Wellcome Prize of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1978. He was elected FRS in 1972. He was elected President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1972, and President of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1985.

The painting depicts a scene from Ovid's Metamorphoses, which tells of Minerva visiting the muses on Mount Helicon, to listen to their song and see the Hippocrene. In the painting, the scene takes place in a wooded mountain side. At the same time, a pastel, distant landscape is depicted in the background. The painting is currently housed at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Subject In his metamorphoses, Ovid recounts: > Through all these mighty deeds > Pallas, Minerva, had availed to guide > her gold-begotten brother. Now she sped, > surrounded in a cloud, from Seriphus, > while Cynthus on the right, and Gyarus > far faded from her view. And where a path, > high over the deep sea, leads the near way, > she winged the air for Thebes, and Helicon > haunt of the Virgin Nine. > High on that mount > she stayed her flight, and with these words bespoke > those well-taught sisters; ‚ÄúFame has given to me > the knowledge of a new-made fountain‚Äîgift > of Pegasus, that fleet steed, from the blood > of dread Medusa sprung‚Äîit opened when > his hard hoof struck the ground.‚ÄîIt is the cause > that brought me.‚ÄîFor my longing to have seen > this fount, miraculous and wonderful, > grows not the less in that myself did see > the swift steed, nascent from maternal blood.‚Äù > [...] Pallas, after she had long admired > that fountain, flowing where the hoof had struck, > turned round to view the groves of ancient trees; > the grottoes and the grass bespangled, rich > with flowers unnumbered‚Äîall so beautiful > she deemed the charm of that locality > a fair surrounding for the studious days > of those Mnemonian Maids. Painting Ovid tells about Minerva's visit to the muses on Mount Helicon. The goddess went there to listen to the muses' songs and behold Hippocrene, which sprung from a rock after Pegasus hit it with his hooves. In the painting, several muses are playing music in a wooded mountain side overlooking a dale. Pegasus is seen in the background on the top right corner. On the opposite corner, there walks in Minerva, with Medusa depicted on her shield. As mentioned by Ovid, according to tradition, Pegasus and his brother Chrysaor sprang from the blood issuing from Medusa's neck as Perseus was beheading her.Hesiod, Theogony 281; Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke 2. 42, et al. Harris, Stephen L. and Gloria Platzner. Classical Mythology: Images and Insights. 2nd ed. (New York: Mayfield Publishing), 1998. 234. The way in which Pegasus was born is similar to the manner in which Athena was born from the head of Zeus. After beheading her, Perseus used Medusa's head, which retained its ability to turn onlookers to stone, as a weapon, and then gave it to Athena (Minerva) who placed it on her shield. In the painting, Minerva's association with the muses jibes with the former's identification as sponsor of the arts. A.P. de Mirimonde postulated that the work represents Minerva's visit to the Muses. The scene does not take place on the Parnassus, but on the Helicon, as evinced in the Hippocrene, \\"Horse's Fountain,\\" stemming from beneath Pegasus's hooves. The painting's landscape was realized by de Momper, while Hendrik van Balen painted the figures, and Jan Brueghel the Elder took care of the flowers. In the painting, the foreground gradually merges into the background. The latter's harmonious landscape jibes with the cheerful mood of the Greek mythological characters painted in the foreground.

The Sudha Hospitals had a humble beginning in the small town of Erode in 1985 as a single-specialty hospital centered on cardiology. It was a 20-bed hospital started by Dr. D Kandaswamy.  History  Founded in 1985 as a cardiology center Sudha hospitals expanded into a multispecialty hospital in 1990 subsequently. Later in 1995, a fertility center was started at Sudha hospitals. It was the brainchild of Dr. S Dhanabagyam who envisioned the need of the society in this sector and to offer fertility treatment to the needy based on science. This hospital was among the pioneers of IVF treatment in the Kongu Region. Extending its presence in nearby regions, a center of Sudha hospitals opened in Coimbatore in 2010. Later Chennai, Madurai, Salem, and Colombo got the opportunity to be served by this multispecialty hospital with having their footprints in these cities. In 2012 Sudha Institute Of Medical Sciences was opened. The credit to this can be given to Dr. K Sudhakar and Dr. S Pardeepa.

The stories recount scenes of life in Jaffna in the 1950s. The Big Girl contains 17 finely-written episodes(including ‚ÄúProfessional Mourners‚Äù) of humour, surprise, pathos and rare insight into the daily lives of people, with all the historical, religious, cultural and psychological diversity and complexity. The style of these stories is deceptively simple (although the stories never are). By using simple language and few obvious stylistic devices, every word becomes important. The book which had disappeared from circulation has now been updated and reprinted in its entirety. These stories evocatively capture the ethos of an era now past and will leave someone nostalgic for a simpler time. Background When this book of short stories written by Alagu Subramaniam was first published in 1964, Ceylon had been independent of the British for about 16 years. Then as now, the effect of colonialism was a topic of open discussion. English writers of the past have often written from the perspective of coloniser rather than colonised. However, Ceylonese born Subramaniam writes from a Sri Lankan viewpoint. In the stories we are shown, not told. Alagu Subramaniam makes each story a small jewel of drama and compassion, revealing in large ways and small. =Solomon‚Äôs Justice= One example. ‚ÄúSolomon‚Äôs Justice‚Äù shows how an imported religious tradition (evangelical Christianity) ‚Äì here a too literal understanding of a Christian story ‚Äì can desensitise people to what native traditions themselves preserve. In this story, the collision of traditions is emphasised by the coroner - who wears both white, ‚Äòthe appropriate colour for an Asian funeral‚Äô and black, a ‚Äònecktie, the symbol of European mourning‚Äô. The magistrate, presiding over a dispute about who is wife and who ex-wife to their deceased husband and thus entitled to make funeral arrangements, insists that the disputants keep ‚Äòthe Queen‚Äôs peace‚Äô. But the appropriateness of keeping to standards of European decorum in a Sri Lankan context is immediately questioned ‚Äì ‚Äò‚ÄùThe Queen‚Äôs peace in Buckingham Palace?‚Äô‚Äù The dispute‚Äôs ‚Äòresolution‚Äô is eventually provided by a Mother Superior. Her brutal suggestion: severing the corpse in half, thus solving the problem over the funeral, a ceremony intended as a mark of reverence, love and respect for the deceased. =The Thorn= Other stories show how the displacement of traditional culture can affect so deeply the most vulnerable. ‚ÄúThe Thorn‚Äù shows the emotional effects on a very young girl (learning English reduces her to tears), and demonstrates the casual emotional blackmail involved (your Mother won‚Äôt go to heaven). These effects embed themselves into even the simplest daily act ‚Äì eating a meal ‚Äì causing frustration and distress through the inability to eat ‚Äòproperly‚Äô with a ‚Äòthorn‚Äô (fork), rather than her fingers. =The Scholar= Several stories examine the conflict between a modernising younger generation and an older tradition. In ‚ÄúThe Scholar‚Äù Thambirajah is introduced as successful in the new, modern way (having received a scholarship to study in England for three years). Such success ironically makes him an attractive prospect for a traditional arranged marriage, which his parents duly organise for him. The story turns on this conflict between tradition and modernity, older and younger generations (Tharimbirajah has met another student, Radha, and both want to marry). However in the end the force of tradition wins out (and here force means exactly that, physical force ‚Äì Radha is beaten into submission). The power of tradition is more destructive still than simply separating two young people ‚Äì but read the story to discover its ending. =Professional Mourners= Often critical, these stories nevertheless display a light tone throughout and often a wry humour. In the ‚ÄúProfessional Mourners‚Äù, the tables are abruptly turned at a village funeral when its self-important organiser boasts of his dragging along the low caste professional mourners despite their own mother‚Äôs death that morning. Instead of the expected approval, he finds himself met with howls of condemnation. Released from their obligation, the lower caste women, now suddenly objects of sympathy (perhaps for the first time in their lives), instead elect to stay and begin wailing ever louder. Stung into redoubling his efforts, the deflated Master of Ceremonies only manages to collapse ignominiously beside the corpse as the mourners wail louder still. =Cousin Thampoo= In ‚ÄúCousin Thampoo‚Äù for example, changing the position of a single comma in the story‚Äôs final sentence would have entirely changed the story‚Äôs significance. The story‚Äôs ending as written is the more complex and resonating one, an example of the care, craft and wisdom of writer and stories.

He was a ardent opposer to the dynasty's attempts to reclaim the north from the barbarians that had overran it during the start of the 4th century. He continued to oppose the northern expeditions made by Jin after Former Zhao's self-destruction in 349 but in 350, he found himself in trouble for disobeying a summon from the emperor. He was banished from office and spent the rest of his years in retirement.  Early career  Cai Mo was initially from Chenliu Commandery (Èô≥ÁïôÈÉ°; around present-day Kaifeng, Henan). When he had reached adulthood, he was nominated as a Xiaolian and Xiucai. The Prince of Donghai, Sima Yue, wanted him to serve his government but Cai Mo declined his offer. When the Disaster of Yongjia happened in 311, Cai Mo migrated south to Sima Rui's domain. In the south, he became the future Emperor Ming of Jin's Army Advisor. After the establishment of Eastern Jin in 318, Cai Mo successively held a number of posts under Emperor Yuan of Jin and his successors.(Ë¨®Âº±ÂÜ†ÂØüÂ≠ùÂªâÔºåÂ∑ûËæüÂæû‰∫ãÔºåËàâÁßÄÊâçÔºåÊù±Êµ∑ÁéãË∂äÂè¨ÁÇ∫ÊéæÔºåÁöÜ‰∏çÂ∞±„ÄÇÈÅø‰∫ÇÊ∏°Ê±ü„ÄÇÊôÇÊòéÂ∏ùÁÇ∫Êù±‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞áÔºåÂºïÁÇ∫ÂèÉËªç„ÄÇÂÖÉÂ∏ùÊãú‰∏ûÁõ∏ÔºåÂæ©ËæüÁÇ∫ÊéæÔºåËΩâÂèÉËªçÔºåÂæåÁÇ∫‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉéÔºåÊõÜÁæ©ËààÂ§™ÂÆà„ÄÅÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÁéãÊï¶Âæû‰∫ã‰∏≠ÈÉé„ÄÅÂè∏ÂæíÂ∑¶Èï∑Âè≤ÔºåÈÅ∑‰æç‰∏≠„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 77 In 328, the rebel Su Jun seized the Eastern Jin capital of Jiankang.

That same year, Yu Liang was planning to hold an expedition north to reclaim Jin's former territories from Later Zhao. Cai Mo greatly opposed it and presented a lengthy reasoning for doing so. In it, he states that Zhao's ruler, Shi Hu, though brutal was a very capable administrator and general. He doubted Yu Liang's ability to defeat Shi Hu, comparing Yu Liang and Shi Hu's quelling of Su Jun and Shi Sheng's rebellion respectfully. He also pointed out the failings of Zu Ti when he attempted to conquer north and the difficulties of crossing the rivers separating the two states. Most of the court agreed with him so Yu Liang could not carry out his plan. When Yu Liang did carry out his expedition the following year, he was swiftly defeated by Later Zhao, just as Cai Mo predicted.(Â§™Â∏∏Ëî°Ë¨®Ë≠∞Ôºå‰ª•ÁÇ∫Ôºö„ÄåÊôÇÊúâÂê¶Ê≥∞ÔºåÈÅìÊúâÂ±à‰º∏ÔºåËãü‰∏çË®àÂº∑Âº±ËÄåËºïÂãïÔºåÂâá‰∫°‰∏çÁµÇÊó•Ôºå‰ΩïÂäü‰πãÊúâÔºÅÁÇ∫‰ªä‰πãË®àÔºåËé´Ëã•È§äÂ®Å‰ª•‰øüÊôÇ„ÄÇÊôÇ‰πãÂèØÂê¶Á≥ªËÉ°‰πãÂº∑Âº±ÔºåËÉ°‰πãÂº∑Âº±Á≥ªÁü≥Ëôé‰πãËÉΩÂê¶„ÄÇËá™Áü≥ÂãíËàâ‰∫ãÔºåËôéÂ∏∏ÁÇ∫Áà™ÁâôÔºåÁôæÊà∞ÁôæÂãùÔºåÈÅÇÂÆö‰∏≠ÂéüÔºåÊâÄÊìö‰πãÂú∞ÔºåÂêåÊñºÈ≠è‰∏ñ„ÄÇÂãíÊ≠ª‰πãÂæåÔºåËôéÊåæÂó£ÂêõÔºåË™ÖÂ∞áÁõ∏ÔºõÂÖßÈõ£Êó¢Âπ≥ÔºåÂâ™ÂâäÂ§ñÂØáÔºå‰∏ÄËàâËÄåÊãîÈáëÂ¢âÔºåÂÜçÊà∞ËÄåÊìíÁü≥ÁîüÔºåË™ÖÁü≥ËÅ∞Â¶ÇÊãæÈÅ∫ÔºåÂèñÈÉ≠Ê¨äÂ¶ÇÊåØÊßÅÔºåÂõõÂ¢É‰πãÂÖßÔºå‰∏çÂ§±Â∞∫Âúü„ÄÇ‰ª•ÊòØËßÄ‰πãÔºåËôéÁÇ∫ËÉΩ‰πéÔºåÂ∞á‰∏çËÉΩ‰πüÔºüË´ñËÄÖ‰ª•ËÉ°ÂâçÊîªË•ÑÈôΩ‰∏çËÉΩÊãîÔºåË¨Ç‰πãÁÑ°ËÉΩÁÇ∫„ÄÇÂ§´ÁôæÊà∞ÁôæÂãù‰πãÂº∑ËÄå‰ª•‰∏çÊãî‰∏ÄÂüéÁÇ∫Âä£ÔºåË≠¨Ë´∏Â∞ÑÊìäÁôæÁôºÁôæ‰∏≠ËÄå‰∏ÄÂ§±ÔºåÂèØ‰ª•Ë¨Ç‰πãÊãô‰πéÔºü‰∏îÁü≥ÈÅáÔºåÂÅèÂ∏´‰πüÔºåÊ°ìÂπ≥ÂåóÔºåÈÇäÂ∞á‰πüÔºåÊâÄÁà≠ËÄÖÁñÜÂ†¥‰πãÂúüÔºåÂà©ÂâáÈÄ≤ÔºåÂê¶ÂâáÈÄÄÔºåÈùûÊâÄÊÄ•‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂæÅË•ø‰ª•ÈáçÈéÆÂêçË≥¢ÔºåËá™Â∞áÂ§ßËªçÊ¨≤Â∏≠Êç≤Ê≤≥ÂçóÔºåËôéÂøÖËá™Â∏•‰∏ÄÂúã‰πãÁúæ‰æÜÊ±∫ÂãùË≤†ÔºåË±àÂæó‰ª•Ë•ÑÈôΩÁÇ∫ÊØîÂìâÔºÅ‰ªäÂæÅË•øÊ¨≤Ëàá‰πãÊà∞Ôºå‰ΩïÂ¶ÇÁü≥ÁîüÔºüËã•Ê¨≤ÂüéÂÆàÔºå‰ΩïÂ¶ÇÈáëÂ¢âÔºüÊ¨≤ÈòªÊ≤îÊ∞¥Ôºå‰ΩïÂ¶ÇÂ§ßÊ±üÔºüÊ¨≤ÊãíÁü≥ËôéÔºå‰ΩïÂ¶ÇËòáÂ≥ªÔºüÂá°Ê≠§Êï∏ËÄÖÔºåÂÆúË©≥Ê†°‰πã„ÄÇÁü≥ÁîüÁåõÂ∞áÔºåÈóú‰∏≠Á≤æÂÖµÔºåÂæÅË•ø‰πãÊà∞ÊÆÜ‰∏çËÉΩÂãù‰πü„ÄÇÈáëÂ¢âÈö™Âõ∫ÔºåÂäâÊõúÂçÅËê¨Áúæ‰∏çËÉΩÊãîÔºåÂæÅË•ø‰πãÂÆàÊÆÜ‰∏çËÉΩÂãù‰πü„ÄÇÂèàÁï∂ÊòØÊôÇÔºåÊ¥õÈôΩ„ÄÅÈóú‰∏≠ÁöÜËàâÂÖµÊìäËôéÔºå‰ªäÊ≠§‰∏âÈéÆÂèçÁÇ∫ÂÖ∂Áî®ÔºõÊñπ‰πãÊñºÂâçÔºåÂÄçÂçä‰πãÂã¢‰πü„ÄÇÁü≥Áîü‰∏çËÉΩÊïµÂÖ∂ÂçäÔºåËÄåÂæÅË•øÊ¨≤Áï∂ÂÖ∂ÂÄçÔºåÊÑöÊâÄÁñë‰πü„ÄÇËòáÂ≥ª‰πãÂº∑‰∏çÂèäÁü≥ËôéÔºåÊ≤îÊ∞¥‰πãÈö™‰∏çÂèäÂ§ßÊ±üÔºõÂ§ßÊ±ü‰∏çËÉΩÂæ°ËòáÂ≥ªÔºåËÄåÊ¨≤‰ª•Ê≤îÊ∞¥Âæ°Áü≥ËôéÔºåÂèàÊâÄÁñë‰πü„ÄÇÊòîÁ•ñÂ£´Á®öÂú®Ë≠ôÔºå‰ΩÉÊñºÂüéÂåóÁïåÔºåËÉ°‰æÜÊîªÔºåË±´ÁΩÆËªçÂ±Ø‰ª•Âæ°ÂÖ∂Â§ñ„ÄÇË∞∑Â∞áÁÜüÔºåËÉ°ÊûúËá≥Ôºå‰∏ÅÂ§´Êà∞ÊñºÂ§ñÔºåËÄÅÂº±Áç≤ÊñºÂÖßÔºåÂ§öÊåÅÁÇ¨ÁÅ´ÔºåÊÄ•ÂâáÁáíË∞∑ËÄåËµ∞„ÄÇÂ¶ÇÊ≠§Êï∏Âπ¥ÔºåÁ´ü‰∏çÂæóÂÖ∂Âà©„ÄÇÁï∂ÊòØÊôÇÔºåËÉ°ÂîØÊìöÊ≤≥ÂåóÔºåÊñπ‰πãÊñº‰ªäÔºåÂõõÂàÜ‰πã‰∏ÄËÄ≥ÔºõÂ£´Á®ö‰∏çËÉΩÊççÂÖ∂‰∏ÄÔºåËÄåÂæÅË•øÊ¨≤‰ª•Âæ°ÂÖ∂ÂõõÔºåÂèàÊâÄÁñë‰πü„ÄÇÁÑ∂Ê≠§‰ΩÜË´ñÂæÅË•øÊó¢Ëá≥‰πãÂæåËÄ≥ÔºåÂ∞öÊú™Ë´ñÈÅìË∑Ø‰πãÊÖÆ‰πü„ÄÇËá™Ê≤î‰ª•Ë•øÔºåÊ∞¥ÊÄ•Â≤∏È´òÔºåÈ≠öË≤´Ê∫ØÊµÅÔºåÈ¶ñÂ∞æÁôæÈáå„ÄÇËã•ËÉ°ÁÑ°ÂÆãË•Ñ‰πãÁæ©ÔºåÂèäÊàëÊú™Èô£ËÄåÊìä‰πãÔºåÂ∞áËã•‰πã‰ΩïÔºü‰ªäÁéãÂúüËàáËÉ°ÔºåÊ∞¥Èô∏Áï∞Âã¢Ôºå‰æøÁøí‰∏çÂêåÔºõËÉ°Ëã•ÈÄÅÊ≠ªÔºåÂâáÊïµ‰πãÊúâÈ§òÔºåËã•Ê£ÑÊ±üÈÅ†ÈÄ≤Ôºå‰ª•ÊàëÊâÄÁü≠ÊìäÂΩºÊâÄÈï∑ÔºåÊáºÈùûÂªüÂãù‰πãÁÆó‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÊúùË≠∞Â§öËàáË¨®Âêå„ÄÇ‰πÉË©î‰∫Æ‰∏çËÅΩÁßªÈéÆ„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 96 Later in 339, Chi Jian passed away.

When the second of the four short emperors, Shi Zun, ascended the throne through a coup, thoughts of a northern expedition became popular among the Jin ministers and generals. Cai Mo, however, remained skeptical. When asked why, Cai Mo told them that he does not think that Jin has a capable figure to lead the state to overcome Later Zhao and that the northern expeditions would only end up depleting Jin's resources and demoralise the people.

It is based on the single-player game SCP - Containment Breach, which is itself based on the paranormal fictional stories of the SCP Foundation website. The game is played from a first person perspective as a scientist, armed guard or task force member, escaping test subject, attacking insurgent, or a rampaging anomalous entity (referred to as an SCP). Background SCP - Secret Laboratory is based on the collaborative writing project of the SCP Foundation. The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization that captures and studies entities and objects that violate natural law (called SCPs); the actions of the fictional organization are documented by a collaborative writing website of the same. The SCP Foundation has inspired several independent video games, including SCP - Containment Breach.Schuhart, Jonah (31 August 2020). What SCP Foundation Is (& Why Its Twitch Popularity Is Growing). Screen Rant. Retrieved 11 October 2020. Description SCP: Secret Laboratory is a first-person, multiplayer video game set within the fictional setting of the SCP Foundation. The game takes place in the immediate aftermath of a \\"containment breach\\" caused by the attacking Chaos Insurgency (an armed group opposed to the SCP Foundation). Players can play as an escaped SCP, an attacking member of the Chaos Insurgency, a member of Nine Tailed Fox (an armed group defending the SCP Foundation), an escaping Class-D Personnel (prison inmates used as test subjects), or an escaping scientist. Clark, Dean (2017). SCP Secret Laboratory First Impression: Great Game, If You Can Get it Working. Game Tyrant. Retrieved 11 October 2020. The game is broken up into rounds. The round will end when the last surviving players are all in the same faction (with the exception of Chaos Insurgency and SCPs). Each round can end in one of four possibilities. * SCPs win the round by killing all Class-D personnel, scientists, and Nine Tailed Fox Units, and preventing Class-D and scientists from escaping. * Class-D have two win conditions: At least one Class-D must successfully escape, and the Chaos Insurgency must not be killed. * NTF have three win conditions: At least one scientist must successfully escape, all the SCPs must \\"be contained\\" (in actual gameplay, all SCPs must be killed), and no Class-Ds can escape. * If a Class-D escapes but all of the Chaos Insurgency die, or all of the SCPs die but a scientist doesn't escape, the round will end in a stalemate, resulting in the loss of all factions. On regular intervals, players who have died or joined the game while it was in progress will respawn as Nine Tailed Fox units or Chaos Insurgency units, and can assist their surviving factions to a victory. The selection of team spawns is based on a ticket system.

He is know for translating the Saundarya Lahari into Tamil. Biography Kaviraja Pandithar hailed from the village of Virai, now identified with Viravanallur in south Pandiya Naadu, although the evidence does not seem to be definitive. He was well versed in both Tamil and Sanskrit. He translated Adi Shankara's work Saundarya Lahari into Tamil. He titled the book Abhirami Paadal. His other works include Anandha Maalai, 'Varaahi Maalai, and Kalai Gyana Dheepam. Kaviraja Pandithar's Jeeva Samadhi (tomb), popularly known as Iyer Samadhi, is in Veera Cholam, 40 kilometers from Vembattur in Sivaganga district. Indications from the translation The translation hints several historical facts that would have otherwise went unnoticed. At one place in the translation, Kaviraja Pandithar gives his name as 'Kanalvil vel', suggesting he had the name of Manmatha, which according to scholars would probably be 'Madana Vel'. The work refers to the King as \\"Rajaraja Mannan\\", \\"Varodhaya\\" and \\"Mannavar Mannar\\" and also indicates that Brahmadarayan as his officer. This title for high-ranking Brahmin officers was very popular during the Chola rule. This king is believed to be Vara Rajaraja, who built the Darasuram temple. In his Royal pedigree, king Rajaraja mentions one Kaviraja, which indicates that Kaviraja Pandithar was a poet under him. The village Virai is believed to be a contraction of any village named Vira as there were several villages in the Chola empire prefixed with the word \\"Vira\\", such as Vira- Cholanallur and Vira-Choalpuram. These points to Kaviraja Pandithar's close connection with the Chola court. The Tamil Translation also extols the greatness of Yamala tantram in more than two verses. Commentary Saiva Ellappa Navalar, an 18th-century scholar, has written a commentary on Pandithar's translation. The commentary gives each verse and its meaning with its poetic content and embellishments. The commentary became very popular that it was published as early as the 1800, the time when printing was introduced in India.

It is 219 km (136 m) in length and runs from the tripoint with Turkey in the west to the tripoint with Azerbaijan in the east. Description The border starts in the west at the tripoint with Turkey and proceeds overland to the tripoint with Azerbaijan via a series of irregular lines and a small section in the east along the Debed river. The western, more mountainous section of the boundary contains two lakes situated quite close to the frontier ‚Äì Madatapa (in Georgia) and Arpi (in Armenia). History During the 19th the Caucasus region was contested between the declining Ottoman Empire, Persia and Russia, which was expanding southwards. Russia formally annexed the eastern Georgian Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti in 1801, followed by the western Georgian Kingdom of Imereti in 1804. Over the course of the 1800s Russian pushed its southern frontier southwards, at the expense of the Persian and Ottoman Empires. By the Russo-Persian War (1804‚Äì1813) and the subsequent Treaty of Gulistan, Russia acquired the bulk of what is now Azerbaijan and the southern Syunik region of modern Armenia.John F. Baddeley, \\"The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus\\", Longman, Green and Co., London: 1908, p. 90 Following the Russo-Persian War (1826‚Äì1828) and the Treaty of Turkmenchay Persia was forced to cede the area of Nakhchivan and the rest of modern Armenia.Gavin R.G. Hambly, in The Cambridge History of Iran, ed. William Bayne Fisher (Cambridge University Press, 1991), pp. 145-146 Russia organised its Georgian and Armenian territories into the governorates of Tiflis, Kutaisi and Erivan. Claimed territory of the Georgian Democratic Republic, with the disputed Lori region in pink Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, the peoples of the southern Caucasus had declared the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (TDFR) in 1918 and started peace talks with the Ottomans. (Armenian Perspective) (Turkish Perspective) Internal disagreements led to Georgia leaving the federation in May 1918, followed shortly thereafter by Armenia and Azerbaijan, however the borders between the three republic were contested. The June 1918 Treaty of Batum ended hostilities between the TDFR and the Ottoman Empire. When the Ottomans pulled out of the area of modern Lori Province in October 1918 the area became disputed between Armenia and Georgia, the bulk of which had been the Borchalo and Akhalkalaki uyezds of the former Tiflis governorate. Georgia stated that the southern limits of he former Tiflis governorate should form the border, whereas Armenia said that the boundary should be redrawn so as to reflect the ethnic situation on the ground. After failed peace talks to settle the frontier issue, clashes broke out in October, followed by more stalled peace talks and a short war in December. A ceasefire was brokered by the British under William Montgomerie Thomson on 17 January 1919 and the disputed area was declared a neutral zone pending further peace talks. Thereafter, both Armenia and Georgia pushed into the Kars area of modern eastern Turkey, annexing lands and causing further disputes between over ownership of territory. The issue was rendered moot when in 1920 Russia's Red Army invaded Azerbaijan and Armenia, ending the independence of both, followed in February-March 1921 by Georgia. Turkey took the opportunity to wrest back lands in the east from Armenia, and Georgia occupied the Lori neutral zone with Armenian approval, so as to prevent it falling into Turkish hands. The USSR's border with Turkey was finalised in October 1921 via the Treaty of Kars, thus fixing the western limit of the Armenia-Georgia border. When the Soviets had established a degree of firm control in the area in early 1921 they sponsored a final border delimitation between Armenia and Georgia, splitting the Lori neutral zone in two (mostly in Armenia's favour) and fixing the border at its current location, an arrangement finalised on 6 November 1921. In 1922 all three states were incorporated into the Transcaucasian SFSR within the USSR, before being separated in 1936. The boundary became an international frontier in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its constituent republics. In 1994 the two countries began work on delimiting their border. There is a large Armenian minority in Georgia, concentrated especially in the border province of Samtskhe‚ÄìJavakheti where they form an at times aggrieved majority. However neither the Armenian or Georgian government have pressed for a rectification of the old Soviet-era border between them.

Ireland was the major area of gold working in the Bronze Age British Isles. Irish gold is especially well known from the Irish Bronze Age as jewellery, in the form of gold lunulae, torcs, gorgets and rings. History The first gold was produced in Ireland c. 2500 BC during the late Neolithic/Atlantic Bronze Age. Sun discs and lunulae were produced from hammered gold. Lead-isotope and major-element analyses have shown this gold to mostly be from Cornwall, also a major ancient source of tin. In return, Irish copper was exchanged for this foreign gold. Around 1200 BC torcs began to be produced using new techniques. From 900 BC bracelets, dress-fasteners, sheet gold collars and ear-spools were made in Ireland.

It had a supporting committee named the Bombay Madrigal Singers Organisation (BMSO). History The Bombay Madrigal Singers Organisation was formed in 1947, the year of Indian Independence. After Victor Paranjoti left to form the Bombay Light Opera Sabha, and the BMSO was being run by committee members led by conductor-tenor Cesar Coelho. The choir was, according to Havaldar, mostly Goan with a few Parsis, and almost no one from any other community. The orchestra was collected ad hoc and was often formed of Bollywood musicians, which, Havaldar explained, was problematic as they would need to be coaxed away from the lure of paid employment in the film studios. But the organisation ceased activities after awhile. It was inactive through the 1970s was defunct by 1980. Taking to the outside world In the 1950s and 1960s, according to Alfred J. Braganza, the Bombay Madrigal Singers, under the baton of Victor Paranjoti, \\"performed with success Konkani songs collected and arranged by Prof. Lucio Rodrigues in some of the premier cities of Europe.\\" Overseas participation Wanting to go beyond concerts of local singers, the BMSO also began promoting concerts by international visiting classical music artists. They also promoted concerts by Indian artists. It worked with Bombay-based embassies -- including the British Council, the American Consulate, the Russian Consulate and the Czech Consulate. These institutions would support and sponsor artists travelling in Asia. Visiting artistes would be asked to play for a reduced fee or free. It has been credited with bringing in \\"artistes and orchestras of the best calibre coming here, courtesy the Bombay Madrigal Singers Organisation (BMSO)\\" -- including Karajan, Rubinstein, Kempff, Oistrakh, Ruggiero Ricci, the Bolshoi Ballet, Vienna Boys' Choir. Among the others who came thorough Bombay were Arthur Rubinstein, Mstislav Rostropovich, Marian Anderson, Isaac Stern, Herbert Von Karayan, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. Operas Later, the BMSO put on operas on their own, with local musicians and singers, and Cesar Coelho as conductor. In 1961, with a full Indian cast, they staged their first opera, sometimes later bringing in tenors and baritones from the UK, with British producer named Derek Bond. The cast included Indian female soloists included Goans Celia Lobo and Fay Sequeira. Between 1961 and 1967, the Bombay Madrigal Singers staged La Traviata, Tosca, Il Trovatore, Lucia di Lammermoor, Faust, Norma and Rigoletto. They used Tejpal Hall at Gwalior Tank as their concert venue over fight nights, gaining huge popularity.

Critics describe Tichy's online magazine, Tichys Einblick (\\"Tichy's Insight\\") of right wing extremism. Four members of the jury, Rainer Hank, Ulric Papendick, Nikolaus Piper and Ursula Weidenfeld, resigned following Merz' decision. The four accused Tichy of using the foundation to boost the reputation of his own publications. Two other members of the jury, Thomas Mayer und Frank Sch√§ffler, spoke in support of Tichy. Sch√§ffler saw \\"a struggle within Liberalism between supporters and opponents of Merkel's political course, both in the European debt crisis and in the migration debate.\\" On 23 September 2020, Dorothee B√§r resigned from the foundation in protest against the chairperson Roland Tichy, whose online magazine Tichys Einblick had published an article about the state secretary of Berlin, Sawsan Chebli, that B√§r viewed as sexist. B√§r said that she can no longer support the foundation, as long as it has \\"a chairperson, under whose direction such articles can be published.\\" Following the controversy, German health minister Jens Spahn and the deputy chairperson of the CDU/CSU, Carsten Linnemann, announced that they were pausing their membership in the foundation. The next day, Tichy declared that he would step down at the end of his term as chairperson, at the end of October. Foundation member Jens Weidmann, who had expressed strong criticism of Tichy in a letter to the other members of the foundation, greeted Tichy's resignation, saying that Tichy's role as publicist was not compatible with his role as chairperson of the foundation.

The Flugf√©lag √çslands aircraft was on its way to V√°gar Airport, making a pass over Mykines before crashing into the highest peak of the island. Of the 34 passenger and crew on board, 8 died in the crash. The captain and 7 passengers, all seated on the left side of the plane, were killed instantly. 26 passengers and crew survived, some with serious injuries. Three passengers hiked for an hour to reach Mykines village to alert the authorities. Most of the villagers went up the mountain to aid the survivors before the arrival of the Danish patrol vessel F348 Hvidbj√∏rnen. Accident The Fokker F-27 TF- FIL, listed as flight FI 704, was originally scheduled to fly from Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, to V√°gar, Faroe Islands on 23 September 1979 but due to fog in V√°gar the flight was delayed and again the day after. On 25 September TF-FIL left Reykjav√≠k with an estimated arrival over the \\"MY\\" radio beacon near V√°gar of 15:52. Due to fog at V√°gar, TF-FIL was unable to land and continued on to Bergen Airport in Norway and landed there at 18:22. The following day weather had improved and TF-FIL left Bergen at 08:22 in the morning. The plane arrived over Mykines at about 10:20 but due to foggy conditions, it went into a holding pattern. At 10:52 TF-FIL acknowledged that they would now turn around to the MY beacon and initiate a landing procedure. At about 10:55 TF-FIL reported that it was inbound over MY and descending. About one minute later, TF-FIL impacted on the slopes of the highest point of Mykines. Cause The cause of the accident was that TF-FIL began the descent through cloud procedure from a starting point other than over \\"MY\\" NDB. During this procedure the aircraft hit close to the highest point of Mykines at an altitude of about 1500 ft. The reason for starting the procedure from a position other than \\"MY\\", was probably an interference caused by TF-FIL's weather radar, which caused the ADF to give the crew an erroneous indication that they were passing \\"MY\\" NDB.

Australians have contributed to a variety of genres of Christian music including the liturgical music, classical music, hymns, Christian rock, country gospel, and Christmas music, as well as cross-over contemporary music sung by popular artists such as Johnny O'Keefe, Paul Kelly (folk rock), Nick Cave and Slim Dusty. Notable contemporary Christian music milestones in Australia include Sister Janet Mead's rock version of \\"The Lord's Prayer\\", which was the first Australian record to sell over a million copies in the United States of America, Jimmy Little's Royal Telephone which made him the first Aboriginal to attain a No. 1 hit on the Australian charts, and Guy Sebastian's Receive the Power which welcomed the Pope to World Youth Day 2008. Liturgical music St Pauls Cathedral organ, Melbourne. Christian liturgical music] arrived in Australia with the First Fleet of British settlers in 1788. Liturgical music originating from religious ceremonies both ancient and modern is today practised within a number of Christian traditions in Australia. Historically, Christianity has been by far the predominant religion in Australia, and it remains the majority religion with 52% of the population identifying as Christian in the 2016 census, thus Christian music has been an important component of cultural life in Australia. Post-War immigration has increased the diversity of Christian musical traditions in Australia, through the growth of denominations like the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, though today, the Catholic Church in Australia is the largest denomination (with almost a quarter of the population), followed by the Anglican Church in Australia (13.3%). Historically, the Anglican component was higher, thus Anglican music and Catholic music along with that of smaller protestant denominations like the Uniting Church in Australia has played an important and enduring role in the development of Australian liturgical music traditions.2016 Census data reveals ‚Äúno religion‚Äù is rising fast; Australian Bureau of Statistics - Media Release, 27 June 2017 ;Anglican music Anglican music was initially the pre-dominant Christian musical tradition in Australia, reflecting its privileged position in the early British colonies.

The song was to be sung by Mushu and perfomed by Eddie Murphy. It was restored for the stage musical adaption Mulan Jr.  Production  = Writing = The dragon guardian Mushu was written as an integral part of Mulan, and as such had various songs written for him during production. Keep 'Em Guessing reached the recording phase, and Billy Porter leant his vocal talents to the demo. The song sees Mushu advising Mulan on how to keep her real identity secret while she pretends to be a male soldier. Lyrics included advice like ‚Äú[put on] an act that‚Äôs so convincing, they‚Äôll think you‚Äôre a dude.‚Äù = Reworking = According to songwriters David Zippel and Matt Wilder, Disney and the production team were \\"very fond\\" of the song, and called Porter's demo \\"phenomenal\\". However, Murphy reportedly refused to sing, so the songwriters suggested he try a comedic \\"talk-sing\\" through the number similar to his work as James Brown on Saturday Night Live, however Murphy declined. Zippel later said: \\"We wrote three different versions of it. But that's because we didn't understand at that point that it wasn't that [Eddie Murphy] wasn't liking our songs, he just didn't want to sing in the film.\\" = Removal = The song, intended to be Mushu's introduction to Mulan, but ultimately was cut and replaced by expositional spoken dialogue and they decided the character could show who he was with only a few words. It became one of a few songs written for Mushu that were cut. = Aftermath = The song was restored for the stage musical adaption Mulan Jr.  Critical reception  Radio Times wrote \\"we can‚Äôt help but wonder how that version of the movie would have played out\\". CinemaBlend noted that without this number, the only time Mushu sings is in the line \\"This guy's got 'em scared to death\\" during \\"I'll Make a Man Out of You.\\" Band Wagon felt the song's deletion was a \\"shame\\" because the \\"jazzy number is so unbelievably smooth\\".

The number sees the initial confrontation between Anna and Elsa, where Anna tries to persuade Elsa to return home and hide her power. There have been two versions of this song shown to the public: one which is a boppy showtune (recorded as a demo) and the other a slower ballad (created as an animatic). There was also a reprise written when Elsa and Anna are locked up. The footage of the deleted scene was shown at an open lecture at the Beijing Film Academy. The song's place in the show would eventually evolve into \\"For the First Time in Forever Reprise, and by \\"I Can't Lose You\\" in the stage musical adaption.

A radiation measuring satellite designed to conduct research for the planned Manned Orbital Laboratory project, OV1-2 was the first American spacecraft to be placed into orbit on a western (retrograde to Earth's rotation) trajectory. Plagued with technical issues starting from two months into the flight, the satellite stopped functioning in April 1967. History In the early 1960s, the US Air Force initiated an effort to reduce the expense of space research. Satellite production was standardized to improve reliability and cost-efficiency. The research satellites would fly on test vehicles or be piggybacked with other satellites. In 1961, the Air Force Office of Aerospace Research (OAR) created the Aerospace Research Support Program (ARSP) to request satellite research proposals and choose mission experiments. The USAF Space and Missiles Organization created their own analog of the ARSP called the Space Experiments Support Program (SESP), which sponsored a greater proportion of technological experiments than the ARSP. The OV1 series was originally designed as adaptations of the 2.7 m \\"Scientific Passenger Pods\\" (SPP), which, starting on 2 October 1961, rode piggyback on suborbital Atlas missile tests and conducted scientific experiments during their short time in space. General Dynamics received a $2 million contract on 13 September 1963 to build a new version of the SPP (called the Atlas Retained Structure (ARS)) that would carry a self- orbiting satellite. Once the Atlas missile and ARS reached apogee, the satellite inside would be deployed and thrust itself into orbit. In addition to the orbital SPP, General Dynamics would create six of these satellites, each to be long with a diameter of , able to carry a payload into a circular orbit. Dubbed \\"Satellite for Aerospace Research\\" (SATAR), the series of satellites were originally to be launched from the Eastern Test Range on Atlas missions testing experimental Advanced Ballistic Re-Entry System (ABRES) nosecones. However, in 1964, the Air Force transferred ABRES launches to the Western Test Range, causing a year's delay for the program. Moreover, because WTR launches would be into polar orbit as opposed to the low-inclination orbits typical of ETR launches, less mass could be lofted into orbit using the same thrust, and the mass of the SATAR satellites had to be reduced. The first OV1 satellite to be launched was OV1-1 on January 21, 1965. Though OV1-1's Atlas booster performed properly, the satellite's onboard Altair rocket did not fire, and the probe was lost. OV1-1 was the only satellite launched on an ABRES mission. Starting with OV1-3, launched and lost May 27, 1965, the remaining OV1 satellites all flew on Atlas D and F missiles that had been decommissioned from ICBM duty. Spacecraft design OV1-2 was, like the rest of the OV1 satellite series, long and in diameter, consisting of a cylindrical experiment housing capped with flattened cones on both ends containing 5000 solar cells producing 22 watts of power. Two antennae for transmitting telemetry and receiving commands extended from the sides of the spacecraft. 12 helium-pressurized hydrogen peroxide thrusters provided attitude control. OV1-2 weighed, with its attached Altair booster, . Experiments OV1-2 carried a six experiment package, sponsored by the Biophysics Group of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory to conduct radiation studies in orbit in support of the Manned Orbital Laboratory project. The data collected would be compared to theoretical radiation doses predicted by computer programs on the ground to verify the utility of their models. The experiment package included two tissue-equivalent ion counters and shielded proton-electron dosimeters, a magnetometer, an X-ray detector, and a proton-electron spectrometer. Mission Launched from Vandenberg's 576-B-3 launch pad at 5 October 1965 09:07:08 UTC via Atlas D rocket, OV1-2 was the first OV1 series satellite to mounted in the nose of the launcher rather than the side-mounted ARS, which instead carried a simulated payload for engineering purposes. Upon release into orbit, OV1-2 tumbled around the Earth, the period of the tumble slowly varying but in the tens of seconds. Though the spacecraft performed normally at first, OV1-2's onboard clock failed on December 1, 1965, this closely followed by the failure of the on-board tape recorder (which allowed data to be stored and transmitted later) on January 13, 1966. Real-time operations were carried out in a limited fashion until total spacecraft failure in April 1967. Despite its short lifespan, OV1-2 did contribute to the body of radiation data and helped verify various models of the interaction of the Sun and Earth's magnetic fields. Legacy and status As of 25 September 2020, OV1-2 is still in orbit, and its position can be tracked on-line. The OV1 program ultimately comprised 22 missions, the last flying on 19 September 1971.

From a young age she was surrounded by people involved in the revival of the Arts and Crafts Movement. She was educated by tutors before she went to St Albans High School for Girls which she left in 1917. Her school education was complete but she went on to live in 1921 above the headquarters of the Art-Workers' Guild. The following year she became an active member of the English Folk Dance Society meeting the folk singing revivalist Charles Sharp. The Dancing Master by John Playford from 1675 In 1933 she would take a degree in history at London's Birkbeck College. In 1939 she was working for the BBC cataloguing their large collection of gramophone records. She had decided that this was her role in life to bring order to libraries. In 1957 she completed her book Playford's English Dancing Master. The 1651 book The Dancing Master by John Playford had been designed for teaching dancing.

Life  Conkling was born on September 28, 1850 in New York City, the son of Frederick A. Conkling and Eleonora Ronalds. His brother was Howard Conkling. He was a member of the Seymour-Conkling family. Conkling attended Mount Washington Collegiate Institute. He then studied mining and metallurgy at the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in 1868. He graduated from there in 1870 with a Bachelor of Philosophy. He then attended post-graduate courses at Harvard University, where he studied under Louis Agassiz, Josiah Whitney, Josiah Parsons Cooke, and Nathaniel Shaler. In 1872, Conkling went abroad and studied geology and mineralogy in the University of Berlin. He was then appointed United States geologist for the Wheeler Survey under George M. Wheeler. He left the federal government in 1879 and began studying law under Erastus C. Benedict. He later graduated from Columbia Law School in 1879. He was appointed Assistant United States District Attorney under Stewart L. Woodword from 1881 to 1882. Conkling then opened a law office. In the 1884 United States House of Representatives elections, he was the Republican candidate for New York's 7th congressional district. He lost the election, but won the most votes any Republican received until then in the Democratic district. He was a member of the New York City Common Council from 1887 to 1888. In 1891, he was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Republican, representing the New York County 7th District. He served in the Assembly in 1892 and 1895. In 1896, Conkling married Ethel Eastman Johnson, daughter of painter Eastman Johnson. They had three daughters, Murril R. L., Olga L. G., and Vivian E. H. He was a member of the Episcopal Church. He was a member of the National Municipal League of New York City, the Metropolitan Club, the City Club of New York, and the Country Club of Tuxedo, New York. He published several books, including \\"Appleton's Guide to Mexico,\\" \\"Life and Letters of Roscoe Conkling,\\" and \\"City Government in the United States.\\" Conkling was separated from his wife Ethel since 1912, and their daughters spent most of their time with her. Upon the deaths of the daughters' uncle and aunt Mr. and Mrs. George Loillard Ronalds, they were to inherit the $750,000 estate, with Conkling appointed its guardian and trustee. His daughters accused him of restricting access to their estate funds, and brought him to court. The accusations and the upcoming trial deeply depressed Conkling, and on September 18, 1917, two days before he was to appear in court, he jumped from his home window on 157 E. 70th St. The day before he died, he executed a new will that left most of his $200,000 estate to his daughters.

Bound entanglement was discovered by M. Horodecki, P. Horodecki, and R. Horodecki. Bipartite entangled states that have a non-negative partial transpose are all bound-entangled. Moreover, a particular quantum state for 2x4 systems has been presented. Such states are not detected by the Peres- Horodecki criterion as entangled, thus other entanglement criteria are needed for their detection. There are a number of examples for such states. There are also multipartite entangled states that have a negative partial transpose with respect to some bipartitions, while they have a positive partial transpose to the other partitions, nevertheless, they are undistillable. The possible existence of bipartite bound entangled states with a negative partial transpose is still under intensive study. = Properties of bound entangled states with a positive partial transpose = Next, we concentrate on states with a positive partial transpose. Bipartite bound entangled states do not exist in 2x2 or 2x3 systems, only in larger ones. Rank-2 bound entangled states do not exist. Bipartite bound entangled states with a positive partial transpose are useless for teleportation, as they cannot lead to a larger fidelity than the classical limit. Strong evidence has been presented that bound entangled states with a positive partial transpose in 3x3 systems have a Schmidt number 2. It has been shown that bipartite bound entangled states with a positive partial transpose exist in symmetric systems. It has also been shown that in symmetric systems multipartite bound entangled states exists for which all partial transposes are non-negative. Asher Peres conjectured that bipartite bound entangled states with positive partial transpose cannot violate a Bell inequality. After a long search for counterexamples, the conjecture turned out to be false. While no singlets can be distilled from bound entangled state, they can be still useful for some quantum information processing applications. Bound entanglement can be activated. Any entangled state can enhance the teleportation power of some other state. This holds even if the state is bound entangled. Bipartite entangled states with a non-negative partial transpose can be more useful for quantum metrology than separable states.

Terminology  The term core outcome refers to a short list of clinical endpoints deemed most important to patients, providers, and researchers related to a health condition. The term core outcome should not be confused with the term outcome, which refers to any clinical endpoint that can be measured in research, regardless of importance. Similarly, core outcomes are distinct from core outcome measurement instruments (also known as core outcome measures). While core outcomes provide guidance on what to measure in clinical studies, core outcome measurement instruments provide guidance on how to measure those selected outcomes.COUSIN_guidance_version_5_9_2018.pdf.

General categories of core outcomes may be referred to as outcome domains. In some cases, a core outcome may also be a core outcome measure (e.g., patient weight).  Scope  Core outcome sets are commonly used by clinical investigators who conduct clinical trials for the treatment of a health condition. The patient population associated with a particular core outcome set may vary, as some apply to all patients with that health condition and others apply to a small subset of that population. Core outcome sets are typically used in research, but they may also be used for patient management during routine clinical care. The need to develop core outcome sets was initially identified by methodologists and aggregators of systematic reviews, like Cochrane, who observed that meta-analyses of trials of similar conditions were frequently impeded by the lack of similarity among the outcomes and outcome measures they employed.Schmitt J, Lange T, Kottner J, et al.

The painting was completed in the early 17th century. It is currently part of the private collection of the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna. Painting The Large Mountain Landscape was probably painted in the early 17th century, possibly in the 1620s. Momper reportedly was particulary active in the 1620s, a period wherein he expanded his repertory. Most of Momper's paintings feature a mountainous topography and evince a more imaginative approach to landscape painting than that of other 17th-century landscapists. The viewer stands on a high vantage point. In the foreground, there are a group of horsemen and walking travelers halting in the shade of a cliff. On the path, some people come, some people go. They travel a trail with wooded, steep cliffs on either side. The people travelling on the winding path, falling back to the background, emphasize the sense of dimension. The staffage of small figures in the large painting is at variance with the large rock formations. To the right, the cliff grows into a peak shrouded by clouds. The contrast between staffage and huge natural features may symbolize the sway of nature over man. However, here, as in every other painting by de Momper, nature is the product of the Fleming's imagination working upon distant memories. Issues of \\"statics and tectonics\\" are not addressed here, and indeed the painting adheres to the imaginative landscape painting style of de Momper and his circle.

Nea is former member of the Noah Clan who was murdered by their leader, the Millennium Earl, for betraying the clan. Before passing away, Nea implanted his memories on the series' protagonist, Allen Walker, in order to be reborn. While the earl seeks Nea again, the 14th instead seeks to murder him in revenge and become the new Earl but is constantly fighting a battle against Allen in order to decide who will be the owner of the body. Nea was based on Hoshino's real life; Originally a triplet, Hoshino lost a sibling and based the idea of having the undead Nea on her own sibling based on the tragedy. His design was based on the character Tyki Mikk, The character is voiced by Ayumu Murase in Japanese. Critical reception to Nea's character has been positive for his relationship with Allen and how enigmatic is his identity which is explored across the series alongside his motivations. Creation and development Nea originates from one of the life experiences from Katsura Hoshino. The story of the manga was created with the concept of pairs. This was influenced by Hoshino being a twin sister. As a result, many characters in the series come in the form of pairs. Hoshino part of a set of triplets. But one of the foetuses disappeared in her mother's stomach and only me and her sister were born. Because of this experience, having discussions about that disappeared child is a normal occurrence. Because her named that child, since she was young, Hoshino disappeared other half by their full name. Or wanting to say what if that child is still in my body and breathing together with me or things like that. This also influenced the Noah clan's memories were born from this feeling. Hoshino plans to give Nea a more direct backstory in the future and states that Cross Marian might be associated within his past. Nea is noted for having a similar appearance to the Noah clan member Tyki Mikk. As a result, among other things, Hoshino made Tyki different by having his hair longer. In Japanese, he is voiced by Ayumu Murase both while possessing Allen and when interacting with him. During recordings of Hallow, Hoshino was surprised by Murase's work, finding him suitable for Allen. Murase's switching between two personalities‚ÄîAllen and the Nea D. Campbell‚Äîimpressed the manga author, who thought at first Murase was using a machine to change the tone of them. Although Murase only appeared with the Millennium Earl twice in Hallow, his job left a positive impression. Appearances Nea the extra member of the Noah Family and the younger brother of Mana Walker. He was the only member, other than the Ninth Disciple Road and the Earl, who was able to control the Noah's Ark. Before the story's timeline, he gave this power away to a human and ran, betraying the Earl and the Clan of Noah. He attempted to kill the Earl to become the new Earl himself but was killed in return by the Earl. Later, it was revealed that the 14th had chosen Allen Walker as his next host. Some time before his death, he told General Cross Marian that if Mana was looked after, he would return to him one day. As time passes in Allen's life, Nea starts awakening whenever Allen's body is harmed by divine substance known as Innocence, using the first time to call the Earl. The Noah invade the Black Order Headquarters to kidnap Allen but Nea briefly revives to tell the Earl he wants him dead and replace him as the new leader of the Clan. When Allen is attacked Yu Kanda's Innocence, Nea appears briefly in Allen's mind to name himself \\"Nea, the one who will destroy everything\\". However, the possession is stopped by Allen's golem Timcampy and Mana's curse on Allen's eye. The Noah fail to kidnap Allen who is attacked by Apocryphos, leading to his escape. The Noah searche the missing Allen alongside the Black Order. Nea fully possesses Allen for brief moments and wonders about the current situation. Once the Earl finds hims again, Nea reveals Earl the truth that both were once a single person but split into two person, Nea and Mana. Both Nea and Mana were adopted by Katherine Eve Campbell until they grew up and Mana murdered Nea. Once Nea kills Mana, he will be able to become the new Millennium Earl, shocking Mana. A depressed Mana abandons his brother Although Nea considers Mana his enemy, he tells Black Order member Howard Link that he will destroy humanity. Reception and analysis Reviewers were impressed with the revelation of Nea's revelations and connections with Allen Walker. Allen's curse to transform into the 14th Noah was praised by Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock found the discussion as intense as a battle. Alex Osborn of IGN was confused by the revelation and had to watch the scene again in order to understand the narrative. Anne Lauenroth of Anime News Network noted the revelation has a powerful impact on Allen because of his future and because he starts doubting his guardian Mana ever loved him while it leaves Allen's mental state while dealing with it mysterious. Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post enjoyed the appearance of the 14th Noah in Allen's mind, praising the character's internal conflict. Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin liked Allen's situation with the 14th in volume 21 and wanted to see more of the same, rather than the focus on Kanda's fight against the Akuma of Alma Karma. In the next volume, Chris Kirby, also of The Fandom Post, was impressed by Allen's possession by Nea. Anne Lauenroth wrote that the struggle between Allen and the 14th Noah left the character in need of a friend. Osborn said he was amazed by Allen's first possession by the 14th Noah; although it was \\"disturbing\\", it enhanced the character's development. Lauenroth praised Ayumu Murase's work for voicing two characters; Allen and the 14th Noah at the same time. Chris Kirby of the Fandom Post found that while Nea's character remains ambiguous when Allen abandons the Order, he still remains appealing due to his connections with both Allen and Timcampy, implying more mysteries to be solved across the narrative. The revelation behind the Earl's true identity alongside Nea's allignment was praised as while the series tends to focus on battles, the manga volume focused on him and Nea focused solely on them with appealing art and wondered about the future of the two Earls. In the book Representing Multiculturalism in Comics and Graphic Novels, Jacob Birken wrote that Allen's use of his powers illustrates the series' theme of identity; although Allen seems to become more human through his Innocence, the revelation that he is the 14th Noah mutes that humanity. Manga.Tokyo considered Allen's transformation into Nea is belongs to one of the series' themes: \\"fate\\": \\"We can‚Äôt be sure until the season ends, but judging from the heavy religious imagery, Allen‚Äôs purpose might have been set in stone before even the series begun. He turning into a Noah (taking the appropriate tanning in the process) is probably as important as every other development made in D.Gray-man until now.\\" References Category:D.Gray-man Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Fictional characters based on real people ","title":"Nea D.

History  The university was founded on 15 August 1944. The basis for its opening was the resolution of the Council of People's Commissars of the Kazakh SSR No. 457 \\"On the training of qualified pedagogical personnel from among the Kazakh female youth.\\" Initially, it included three faculties: physics and mathematics, history, language and literature. In 1945, the Faculty of Natural Geography was opened, in 1968: the Faculty of Music and Song. In 1971, the Faculty of Language and Literature was transformed into a Philological Faculty, and the Faculty of History into History and Pedagogy. In 1984, the Faculty of History and Education was divided into the Faculty of History and the Faculty of Preschool Education. After 1954, the question of closing the institute was raised several times, since it allegedly fulfilled its purpose, but the Kazakh SSR authorities decided to keep the university. In 2000, as part of the institute, there were historical-philological and economic faculties, as well as faculties of natural history and educational services. Since 2003, the university has published its own newspaper named Aqtoty. Since 2004, within the framework of the State Program for the Development of Education for 2005‚Äì2010, an original quality management system has been introduced at the institute and the transition to a credit system of education, as well as to a two-stage training system \\"bachelor's - master's\\", has begun. In the ranking of the National Accreditation Center under the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the university has been ranked second among pedagogical educational institutions since 2006. By the Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 805 of 25 December 2018, the Kazakh State Women's Teacher Training University was given the status of National.  Structure  Scientific research at the university is carried out by 32 departments, a research institute for social and gender studies, a fundamental research center and 3 research laboratories. Faculties: * Faculty of Culture and Art * Social and Humanitarian Faculty * Faculty of Natural Sciences * Faculty of Philology * Faculty of Physics and Mathematics * Faculty of Pedagogy and Psychology Today the university employs over 700 teachers.

Campus  The educational building specially for the Women's Teacher Training University was built in 1954 by the architect V. Biryukov and engineer V. Brandt. It is located at Gogol Street, 114. After the construction of a new building at Aiteke bi Street, 99, the administration and a number of departments were transferred to it. The new building was built on the back of the historic building.  Architecture  The building is an architectural monument, built in classic style characteristics using national Kazakh motives. The construction in the volumetric-planning composition of a 3-story, rectangular building was designed in the classicist traditions. The main entrance, located along the central axis of the structure in the projection, is accentuated by a portico flanked by pylons. The first floor is designed as a basement, rusticated. Throughout the projection, the plane of the wall of the first floor is dissected by pilasters that serve as supports for the columns of the portico. The composition solution of the facades is based on the horizontal rhythm of paired window openings. Along the perimeter of the building runs a multi-profile cornice with a small extension, decorated with elements of Soviet symbols and national ornamentation. = Monument status = On 10 November 2010, a new State List of Historical and Cultural Monuments of the Local Significance of the city of Almaty was approved, simultaneously with which all previous decisions on this matter were declared invalid.

Plot The story opens during the Spanish Civil War in Barcelona where the protagonist, Victor Dalmau, has left his medical studies to help the Republicans against the Fascist forces of General Franco. His brother, Guillem, is also a Republican soldier, but he dies in the Battle of Ebro. Victor has to seek the help of his Basque friend, Aitor Ibarra, to send his mother and Guillem's wife, Roser, to France, as the victory of Franco's forces is becoming more and more certain. After many trials, he reunites with Roser in France, and they hear that Winnipeg, a ship chartered by the poet Pablo Neruda, is going to take a certain number of Spanish refugees to Chile. Desperate to grab the chance, Victor and Roser get married reluctantly to qualify for the journey. They embark on this journey, but migration to the new country is not the end of their problem, and there again they are forced to witness the fight between freedom and repression, which seems to be a neverending war. Reception On the review aggregator website Book Marks, which assigns individual ratings to book reviews from mainstream literary critics, the novel received a cumulative \\"Positive\\" rating based on 20 reviews: 8 \\"Rave\\" reviews, 8 \\"Positive\\" reviews, 3 \\"Mixed\\" reviews, and 1 \\"Pan\\" review. Marcela Davison Avil√©s of NPR admires the \\"gifted stories\\" of Allende, noting that \\"A Long Petal of the Sea is a love story for these times. But it's not a story beholden to any era. Its call is immutable, like Neruda's hope\\". The Observer praises the skill with which Allende tells a story of \\"displacement\\", \\"a theme sharpened by her own life story\\". In her review for The New York Times, Paula McLain highlights the themes of this novel: \\"there is the sense that every human life is an odyssey, and that how and where we connect creates the fabric of our existence: the source of our humanity\\". Kirkus Reviews praises Allende's storytelling skill: \\"Allende tends to describe emotions and events rather than delve into them, and she paints the historical backdrop in very broad strokes, but she is an engaging storyteller\\".

He was a member of various communist and syndicalist organisations; becoming one of the leaders of the German Revolution in Braunschweig, and subsequently a member of the Weimar National Assembly, convened in 1919 to draw up a constitution for the new German republic. In 1933, he came to the notice of the authorities as a \\"background member\\" of an anti-government resistance group. In 1945, after he was found dead in the little summer-hut in the his son's allotment (where he lived for the last two years of his life) it was determined that ever since undergoing a succession of severe torture sessions at the hands of the security services during and after 1935, he had suffered without a break from the bone tuberculosis that killed him. His name is accordingly listed on the \\"Reichstag Memorial\\" to the 96 members of the parliament who died \\"unnaturally\\" during the twelve Hitler years.Gerhard Schildt, In: Horst-R√ºdiger Jarck, G√ºnter Scheel (Hrsg.): Braunschweigisches biographisches Lexikon. 19. und 20. Jahrhundert. Hahn, Hannover 1996, , p. 410 Life =Provenance and early years= August Ernst Reinhold Merges was born into a Protestant family in 1870 at Malstatt-Burbach, just outside Saarbr√ºcken (into which it has subsequently been subsumed). He was born just six months before the Battle of Sedan which opened the way for the rapid political unification of Germany, formally in January 1871. The outbreak of war forced the family to relocate to Idar-Oberstein in the hill country a short distance to the north of Saarbr√ºcken. August's mother, Anna, died very soon after his birth. Nikolaus Merges, his father, was a butcher and the author of a teaching manual for journeyman-butchers on making sausages and other meat products. The family came originally from the south-west of Germany, near the frontier north of Basel. Nikolaus Merges had been conscripted for military service, so the infant was sent to live with foster parents. While in foster-care he contracted Rickets, caused by malnutrition. As a result he never grew above 147 cm, was lame in one leg, and lived his life with a bent back. He would become known in some quarters as \\"Krummer August\\" (loosely, \\"bent August\\"). Fortunately his formidable mental abilities more than made up for his physical difficulties. After he grew up and took to public speaking, some thought him garrulous, others eloquent. By the time he was six his father had brought the family back together, and he spent six years attending junior school at Idar-Oberstein. The family then moved away from the Saarbr√ºcken area, settling in Melle (a short distance to the south- east of Osnabr√ºck). August was keen to progress to secondary education, but there was not enough money for that: instead, in 1884, his father sent him away to Bremen to undertake an apprenticeship in tailoring. =Young socialist= He combined his apprenticeship with a passionate autodidacticism, reading voraciously on political and academic topics. It was also during this time in Bremen that he joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which until 1890 was operating under a under a legal ban. In practical terms, the ban was more widely accepted in some parts of Germany than in others. In the booming industrial port-city of Bremen socialism was already becoming well entrenched. By the time he completed his apprenticeship in 1886, Merges was already turning up at public meetings, speaking up for trades unionism and social democracy. He was sent to prison on more than one occasion, but his terms of incarceration were evidently relatively brief, and his eldest son's subsequent notes indicate that August Merges regarded prison as a necessary element in his personal activism.Erinnerungen Alfred Merges, 25.09.1958; in: Bundesarchiv SgY30 EA 0623 After his apprenticeship he moved to Berlin where he pursued his study of tailoring at a vocation college. However, he became convinced that if he spent his life in tailoring it would only be a matter of time before his health was completely destroyed. There was still no question of being able to pursue higher education. Aged 21, and desperate to find an opening in politics, he wrote to the leading SPD Reichstag member, Georg von Vollmar, begging for help in finding him a way to an \\"academic education, in order to be able to devote himself to the socialist cause afterwards\\", and setting out his political abilities and experiences. The letter was kept, has been retained among Georg von Vollmar's papers, but there is no sign that its writer ever received an answer.Brief von August Merges vom 2.2.1891 an Georg von Vollmar; Georg von Vollmar Papers Papers Nr. 1419a Institut vor Social History Amsterdam Merges abandoned his course in Berlin and returned to Bremen where he supported himself as a journeyman-tradesman through tailoring work. He continued with his programme of self-education: after his marriage he would work full-time for the party as an economist at their Alfeld (Hildesheim) trades union building. =Marriage= In 1899 he relocated to Delligsen, a small country town between Hanover and G√∂ttingen, where he continued to work at tailoring and where, that same year, August Merges married Minna Hermes. Their son Alfred was born barely nine months later. Between 1901 and 1907 the marriage produced four more recorded children. =Socialist activism in a period of accelerating social and political tension= In 1906 he was finally able to abandon tailoring work, becoming instead a salaried party official, working in nearby Hildesheim and Alfeld. Two years later, in 1908, he was elected to membership of the Delligsen municipal council. He was by now gaining a reputation in the region as an effective political orator (or \\"agitator\\"). He took a leading role in Labour movement demonstrations, campaigning powerfully for democratic state elections, which meant campaigning against the infamous \\"Dreiklassenwahlrecht\\" (literally \\"Three-class voting entitlement\\"), whereby the 80% of voters paying the lowest amounts in tax had the same levels of influence in election results as the richest 5% paying the highest amounts. (The precise proportions varied slightly over time according to tax rates and levels of prosperity, but the underlying inequality would endure till 1918.) In 1910 or 1911 August Merges relocated with his family to the city of Braunschweig, an important commercial and administrative centre for the region. Here he returned to his former trade, running a tailors' shop. He combined this with work as a promoter and contributing editor with \\"Der Volksfreund\\" (literally, \\"The Friend of the People\\". Founded in 1871, the \\"Volksfreund\\" was one of the longest established regional daily party newspapers anywhere in Germany. His written pieces, like his other political activity, marked him out as a representative of the more radical \\"left-wing\\" elements in the party. The overturning of \\"bourgeois capitalist society\\" was high on his political agenda throughout his political career. =Wartime Pacifist= War broke out in July 1914. Socialist activists in the affected countries were appalled to see \\"patriotism\\" trumping \\"internationalism\\" in the party leaderships. In Germany though not all) of the party's members of parliament backed their parliamentary leadership group by voting in favour of funding for the war. Among the membership, more than four years of war caused a steady increase in anti-war sentiment, as the deaths mounted in the battle zones and extreme hunger became commonplace in the cities. August Merges was among many left-wing members of the party who from the outset campaigned energetically against the \\"capitulation of social democracy\\" in 1914. Hostility to official party backing for the \\"imperialist war\\" triggered the rapid emergence of an implacable opposition faction among party activists inside the party. August Merges was prominent among them. Early in 1915 Merges teamed up with Sepp Oerter and August Thalheimer to set up the \\"Braunschweiger Revolutionsclub\\" in pursuance of their political objectives. He was also close to the anti-war Spartacus League emerging in Berlin. His friendship with Thalheimer gave him a direct link to the movement's central leadership in Berlin: Thalheimer was a regular contributor to \\"Spartakusbriefe\\", the movement's newspaper, from 1916. The \\"Braunschweiger Revolutionsclub\\" comprised approximately fifteen members, all united in their opposition to the party leadership decision to support war funding. Roughly half of them were, like Merges, paid officials of the party or of trades unions linked to it. The others were young people from the \\"Bildungsverein jugendlicher Arbeiter und Arbeiterinnen\\" (loosely, \\"Young workers' education association\\"). Especially for these younger club members, August Merges was something of a role model. He was among the first to sign the letter of protest organised by Rosa Luxemburg and addressed by the Spartacus Leagues \\"International Group\\" to the SPD party executive on 9 June 1915 in which they demanded an end to party support for the war. At the start of 1916 the \\"Braunschweiger Revolutionsclub\\" renamed itself \\"Spartakusgruppe Braunschweig\\". The group's influence and support inside the party continued to grow, and at party conferences and meetings it increasingly found itself sufficiently well represented to be able to determine the outcome of votes taken at the end of debates. In most businesses and factories in the region it was able to appoint \\"Vertrauensleute\\" (trusted Spartacus Group representatives). Towards the end of 1916 Merges found himself detained in \\"protective custody\\" because of his \\"anti-military activities against the war\\".Peter Berger: Brunonia mit rotem Halstuch. Novemberrevolution 1918/19 in Braunschweig. Hannover 1979, p. 110. In 1917 the party finally split over the contentious issue of parliamentary party support in for war funding. In Braunschweig, where anti-war sentiment was particularly strong, a majority of party members transferred their memberships to the breakaway Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\") / USPD. Merges, by this time no longer in prison, was naturally among those switching to the USPD. He was in practice already a member of the Spartacus League and during 1918 also became actively engaged in the emerging International Communists of Germany (\\"Internationalen Kommunisten Deutschlands\\"), a short-lived anti-war group that had originated in Bremen, and which a few months later joined with other organisations at a three day congress held in Berlin between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919, to form the Soviet inspired Communist Party. During 1917/18 he also headed up \\"Deserteurzentrale\\", a group founded by the Spartakists that looked after army deserters, giving them shelter and providing them with (falsified) identity papers and (forged) food stamps. =Revolution= As the military lines in the west collapsed, and just over a week before war ended, on 3 November 1918 addressed a (n illegal) anti-war protest rally in Braunschweig attended by around (or at least: sources differ) 1,000 people. Participants had expected to be addressed by Karl Liebknecht, but Liebknecht had cancelled his visit at short notice, travelling instead that day to Kiel. As a skilful and committed orator, endowed with strong strategic skills, August Merges had a huge influence on political developments in Braunschweig between the end of the war and the middle of 1919. During the early morning of 8 November 1918 the shops opened as usual and the housewives purchased their daily rations, while workers walked or took the tram to their usual workplaces. In the factories, workers found their Spartakist fellow- workers waiting for them, having arrived early. Four days after the outbreak of the naval mutiny in the northern ports, the factory workers' of Braunschweig were now invited to participate in a spectacular and meticulously choreographed series of events in the city centre. A little later, an armed group of USPD members appeared in the city centre at the building used for the production of the \\"Volksfreund\\" (SPD party newspaper) and took it over without difficulty or drama. The revolution would need a newspaper and a printing press. Sources describe this as the first significant revolutionary act undertaken by members of the USPD against the property of the residual so- called \\"majority SPD\\". Merges referred to a quasi-judicial party decision taken in April 1917, following the party split whereby, he recalled, the \\"Volksfreund\\" was promised to the breakaway party: the Braunschweig labour movement were simply taking back property that had been stolen from them. After the building had been seized, a number of soldiers remained in it, identifiable from their red armbands and the rifles slung over their shoulders. A table was placed in front of the main entrance. The sight of August Merges standing on it struck one sympathetic comrade as incongruous: the good little crippled August, who had never so much as killed a fly in his life, stood before the audience with a rifle secured in a large black case mounted on a stout belt. If the effect of his outfit invited mirth, there was nothing comical about the power of his demagogic eloquence. That day August Merges established his credentials for leadership of the November revolution, at least as far as Braunschweig was concerned. At the end of the morning, at the request of Merges, a joint meeting of a new Braunschweig Soldiers' and Workers' soviets was convened. It was determined that a republican structure was necessary for the governance of a \\"Free State\\". Towards the end of the afternoon a delegation led by August Merges made their way to the ducal palace. After twenty minutes the last Duke Braunschweig signed and, without a word, handed back the abdication statement which had thoughtfully been prepared for him. The Soldiers' and Workers' soviets were now in charge, under their chairman identified simply as \\"Husar Sch√ºtz\\". Husar Emil Sch√ºtz is thought to have been a former infantryman, like hundreds of thousands of others recently returned from the military defeat in France. Two days later, on 10 November 1918 the Socialist Republic of Braunschweig was proclaimed by the Soldiers' and Workers' soviets, to be administered by a USPD government. At the suggestion of Sepp Oerter, the soviets proclaimed August Merges as their president. It was in many ways the high-point of his political career. It is not clear how much consensus existed between members Soldiers' and Workers' soviets on the future government structure for the new Socialist Republic. It is therefore not clear whether August Merges was expected to be a hands-on executive president, or a presiding figure. Some sources indicate that \\"real power\\" was to be exercised on a day-to-day basis by the government council of eight \\"people's commissars\\". August Merges proposed the creation of radical Soviet Republic, based on the Soviet model. His party comrade Sepp Oerter, whose opinion carried considerable weight, favoured a more parliamentary approach from the outset, advocating a directly elected state parliament to work alongside the eight \\"people's commissars\\". In any case, it was already clear that the November revolution in Braunschweig as part of a wider series of uprisings across Germany. The longer term objective for the workers' and soldiers' councils became the creation of a unified German republic into which Braunschweig would be absorbed. But the more immediate priority was the creation of a functioning economy and socialist state in Braunschweig. The draft electoral law adopted by the workers' and soldiers' councils of Braunschweig provided for equal and direct voting rights for all persons aged 20 or above, including even women. Provision was also made for voting in elections to be undertaken using a secret ballot. It was one of a number of important precedents. On 23 November 1918 Merges became a participant in the \\"Rat der Volksbeauftragten\\" (loosely, \\"Council of People's Representatives\\"), which was fulfilling some of the functions that would have been the responsibility of the German government, if there had been one in the aftermath of the resignation of Chancellor Max von Baden. When the assembly took a vote on 30 November 1918 to provide for elections to a new National Assembly mandated to devise a new constitution for a new kind of Germany, there were just two votes opposing the idea. One came from a member from Gotha called Geitner. The other opposing vote came from August Merges. The vote significantly raised the public profile of August Merges, who found himself pilloried in print as the \\"red dictator\\" in what his son would later call the \\"capitalist press\\". His objections, which reflected the radical concerns of many leading figures in the Braunschweig commissariat, were based on the marginalising of the workers' soviets and central involvement in the proposal of Friedrich Ebert of the SPD. The USPD leaders in Braunschweig had neither forgotten nor forgiven the 1914 \\"capitulation of social democracy\\" to the demands of an imperialist war. A national election for the National Assembly was held on 19 January 1919. The electorate now included everyone, regardless of gender, aged 20 or more. More than 30 million votes were cast: in the previous national election, held under a more restricted franchise in 1912, slightly more than 12 million votes had been cast. August Merges was one of two members elected from the \\"Braunschweig Socialist Republic\\". However, a month later he delivered a scathing speech attacking the national Ebert- Scheidemann government and the \\"betrayal of the revolution by parliamentarism\\". On 22 February 1919 he resigned both his seat in the National Assembly and renounced his presidency in the state government of the \\"Braunschweig Socialist Republic\\" (as it was still known). In Braunschweig, following state elections on 22 December 1918 in which no party had gained an overall majority in the new state parliament, the USPD was being forced to enter into coalition with the untrusted SPD. The creation of the Communist Party at a congress in Berlin at the beginning of January 1919 had been the result of a coming together of various left-wing groupings, including a large number of defectors from the USPD. The Socialist Republic of Braunschweig was one of several regions in Germany, away from Berlin, where the USPD had remained strong, and the Communists were not yet able to attract significant levels of support from working class voters. On 25 January 1919 August Merges was elected chairman of the Braunschweig region USPD.Volksfreund, 29. Januar 1919. This may have seemed a significant development, but larger forces were in play. During the first three months of 1919 the revolution continued to develop across Germany. Political differences were increasingly being played out on the streets: approximately three months after his election to the regional USPD party chairmanship, August Merges appears to have switched his own political allegiance to the Communist Party. Despite his government involvement at least till 22 February, it is thought that Merges, was the leader of a number of local insurrections during the turbulent early months of 1919, though details of his involvement are hard to pin down. Meanwhile revolution encouraged counter-revolution: a succession of \\"Freikorps\\" (private armies) emerged, manned by (otherwise) unemployed former soldiers and organised by (otherwise) unemployed former generals, who had returned from the war disillusioned, powerfully nostalgic for the \\"good old days\\", and with a taste for violence. On 17 April 1919 General Georg Maercker appeared in Braunschweig with a large Freikorps unit in order to put down the general strike, which had been called by \\"extremist Spartakist elements\\" (almost certainly including August Merges) and was \\"causing chaos\\". Maercker was a pioneer of the post-war Freikorps movement and arrived with his reputation enhanced by his contribution to averting some soviet-style revolution in Berlin. It is only fair to add that one of Maercker's first public actions following his arrival in the \\"Socialist Republic of Braunschweig\\" involved nothing more brutish than holding a press conference. Fearing arrest, August Merges nevertheless went into hiding in Braunschweig, living \\"underground\\" (with his place of residence not registered at the city hall). At some point over the next few weeks he fled to Berlin. = Factionalism and fractiousness among the comrades = By the time of the Second Party Conference, held by the Communist Party in October 1919, August Merges was a party member. The conference took place shortly after the so-called March uprising in central Germany, at a time when the party had been banned, and it was accordingly held under conditions of illegality and secrecy: this means that details of what actually took place are in short supply. It took place in Heidelberg, and is generally referred to as the Heidelberg party conference, but it was also held in nearby Mannheim and at the Wachenburg Castle. August Merges took part. He did not hold back from spelling out his opposition to the insufficiently radical approach being taken by the national party leadership under Paul Levi, Clara Zetkin and Wilhelm Pieck. During the early summer of 1920 Merges resigned from the Communist Party and became a founder member of the \\"anti- parliamentarian\\" Communist Workers' Party (\\"Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands\\" / KAPD). He took most of the Braunschweig members of the Communist Party with him, and served very briefly as a member of the KAPD national party executive.>Olaf Ihlau: Die Roten K√§mpfer. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung in der Weimarer Republik und im Dritten Reich. Meisenhain am Glan 1969, p. 174. Within the KAPD he was noted as a member of the so-called \\"federalist minority\\", calling for the dissolution of communist parties and the creation of \\"Unions\\". He was strongly hostile to any move towards a centralise organisation, and therefore also acutely suspicious of the recently launched Communist International. = Sch√∂ningen incident = On 15 March 1920 August Merges addressed a political rally at Sch√∂ningen, a small town to the east of Braunschweig, and along the main road towards Magdeburg. He had been invited to do this by an action committee of SPD, USPD and Communist Party members that had come together in response to the opening salvoes, in Berlin on 12/13 March, of the (ultimately unsuccessful) Kapp Putsch against Germany's republican government. The workforces at all the significant factories in Sch√∂ningen were already participating in a general strike, and the agricultural workers in at least 18 small towns and villages around Sch√∂ningen had already been on strike even before news came through of the antics of Wolfgang Kapp. Mergers gave a characteristically fiery speech. With a return to civil war a realistic prospect, the speech culminated with a call to disarm the Sch√∂ningen citizen militia, on the grounds that \\"the bourgeoisie do not need to be armed\\". After the speech Merges pulled together an apparently ad hoc \\"workers' commission\\": these men were tasked with demanding the surrender of the weapons of the citizen militia from Adolf Lindemann, its leader. Lindemann, who was also a town councillor, was in the town hall while this was going on: when he became aware of the demand that he should hand over the weapons he refused. A section of the demonstrators now stormed the town hall and extracted Lindemann, applying a combination of threats and physical encouragement. On the town hall steps he again refused to order the hand over of the weapons. Initially the crowd let him go free, but then others of them grabbed him and forced him to accompany them to the castle square (\\"Der Burgplatz\\"), where members of the citizen militia had already gathered in order to protect the weapons stored in the medieval castle. Merges now joined with Mayor Schelz to try and calm the mood and dissuade the angry crowd gathered outside the town hall from following Lindemann and his captors to the castle square, but many demonstrators refused to be put off. Fighting broke out: according to eye witness reports the number involved ranged between 500 and 900 people. The first shots were fired shortly after midday, and the first person to be killed was a militia man called Tankmar Eisfeld. In the end nine people were killed, and at least a further twenty suffered significant injuries. August Merges did not accompany the demonstrators to the castle square, but instead, according to reports, \\"disappeared\\". It was not till after nightfall that government forces arrived, \\"narrowly averting a further bloodbath\\", according to at least one source. By 20.00 order had been restored. A number of arrests took place the next day, and although it is unclear just how long the soldiers remained in town, but it seems likely that they had departed by 26 March, the day on which the factory strikes in Sch√∂ningen following the resignation from the council of Lindemann and an amnesty for most of the after most of the demonstrator-suspects detained following the fighting. Meanwhile there had been a further casualty at Sch√∂ningen on 16 March, when a militia commander was shot. A Colonel Stachow now issued an arrest warrant against August Merges, whom he considered culpable over the incidents: Merges had \\"incited the workers to disarm the legally established citizen militia .... as a result of which fighting and rioting had broken out, during which several people were wounded and killed\\". Despite an army search, August Merges managed to address a meeting at Sch√∂ppenstedt that same day. His audience of workers succeeded in preventing his arrest.Geschichtskommission der DKP Niedersachsen (Hrsg.): Bl√§tter zur Geschichte der nieders√§chsischen Arbeiterbewegung Nr. 1 August 1980. Hannover 1980, p.5 It is not clear whether he was ever arrested in connection with the events at Sch√∂ningen during March 1920: if he was, he cannot have been detained for long. Sources do, in any case, mention that he was prosecuted several times in connection with his political involvements during the 1920s and early 1930s. = The Second World Congress of the Comintern = In July 1920 it turned out that Merges might have set aside his misgivings about the Comintern sufficiently to travel to Moscow so as to attend the organisation's Second World Congress. He was to participate as one in a two man KAPD delegation, together with his party comrade Otto R√ºhle. Before the congress even opened Merges and R√ºhle took the opportunity of a preparatory meeting to object vociferously to the \\"guidelines on the basic tasks of the Communist International\\" which had been prepared by Karl Radek. The document had evidently been approved by all four comrades on the executive committee, which included not just Radek, but also Lenin, Bukharin and Zinoviev. Merges and R√ºhle inferred that acceptance of these ground rules was a pre-condition for attending the congress. The men from the KAPD objected to the centralised and bureaucratic structure on which Radek's guidelines were predicated. They objected to the idea of any sort of \\"power centre\\" for the Comintern. The organisational and structural assumptions underlying the congress preparations were, they asserted, opposed to the core values of the KAPD. Having stated their position, Merges and R√ºhle departed, and started on their return back to Berlin. Before they had travelled very far, they received a renewed invitation to attend the congress, however, accompanied by an assurance that the KAPD delegation would enjoy full voting rights, and their participation would not be constrained by any preconditions. As far as can be determined, however, August Merges and Otto R√ºhle continued on their way home, without attending the congress itself. Naturally the mainstream Communist Party of Germany had also sent a delegation. The KPD team was led by Paul Levi who at this stage was still the party leader. According to a letter which Merges received from a comrade who had remained in Moscow for long enough to attend the congress, \\"when Levi found out in Moscow that R√ºhle and Merges had been given full rights to give their opinions and join in the votes, Levi had delivered an ultimatum on behalf of his delegation: Levi's team would quit the congress if R√ºhle and Merges appeared!\\". Merges and R√ºhle faced strong criticism from comrades over their behaviour while representing the party in Moscow during July and August 1920. R√ºhle was expelled from the (by now splintering) party in October 1920: it is possible that Merges was expelled at the same time. Nevertheless, Merges was present at the party conference at Gotha in February 1921, making a powerfully supportive intervention on behalf of R√ºhle. He contributed a second intervention at the conference on the \\"women question\\". = Radical involvement after 1921 = In October 1921 Merges was involved in setting up the unified \\"anti-parliamentarian anti-authoritarian\\" General Labour Union (\\"Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union\\"/ AAU), a radical communist which, it was reported, combined the political and economic aspirations of communist workers in a single organisation.Prichard, Alex; Kinna, Ruth; Pinta, Saku; Berry, Dave (2012). Libertarian Socialism: Politics in Black and Red. Palgrave Macmillan. The idea was to replace the squabbling splintering parties pf the far-left in Germany (and possibly internationally) with a single political and operational entity. In Braunschweig, along with Merges, the AAU gained approximately twenty members, including the former people's commissioner for education and culture during the early months of the \\"Socialist Republic of Braunschweig\\", Minna Fa√ühauer.Reinhard Bein: Widerstand im Nationalsozialismus. Braunschweig 1930 bis 1945. Braunschweig 1985, p. 111. Merges and Fa√ühauer also both involved themselves with the anarcho-syndicalist Free Workers' Union (\\" Freie Arbeiter Union\\") / FAU, appearing as guest speakers at FAU meetings. In addition, according to a biographical report submitted to East Germany's Institute for Marxism-Leninism by Alfred Merges, his son, in 1958, during this period Merges became \\"very active on behalf of Red Aid\\", a workers' welfare organisation, widely (and almost certainly correctly) believed to have close ties with Moscow. In 1926 Merges was a co- founder of the \\"Spartakusbund linkskommunistischer Organisationen\\" (known more simply as the \\"Spartakus League Nbr. 2\\"). That year he chaired its first (and only) national conference. which took place on 20/21 November in G√∂ttingen. \\"Spartakus League Nbr. 2\\" was a coming together of various \\"Soviet\\" communist and syndicalist groups. During the later 1920s Merges pulled back from political activism. His son later recalled that August and Minna Merges lived in very basic conditions. August still sometimes undertook tailoring work in order to earn some money and / or in order to help out a comrade. Meanwhile his eldest son Alfred spent much of the decade living \\"underground\\" after escaping from jail, in 1923, having been convicted on account of his own political activism, involving \\"violation of the Explosives Law\\". = Under Hitler = The Hitler government took power in January 1933 and quickly transformed Germany into a one- party dictatorship. Merges immediately wrote a political pamphlet with the title \\"Hitler bedeutet Krieg und Untergang\\" (\\"Hitler means war and downfall\\"), which his son Walter and a comrade called Oswald Berger printed and then distributed in front of the Braunschweig labour exchange. Even during those early years of Hitlerism, August and Minna Merges were subjected to numerous house searches by the security services, and many of August's books were confiscated. German unemployment exceeded six million in the wake of the Great depression, representing a record 30% level just before the National Socialists took over the country, but during 1933 and 1934 economic conditions improved rapidly, both out of deference to the economic cycle and on account of rampant government spending supported by deficit funding. The post-democratic Hitler government, during the early years of its rule, was popular even among many working class voters who under other circumstances might have been tempted by state communism. August Merges and his long-standing activist ally Minna Fa√ühauer very soon became convinced that talk of a communist revolution under circumstances in which the masses were not wishing to listen would amount simply to \\"banging one's head against the wall and creating martyrs\\". Younger AAU comrades, such as Hermann Schade, took a less defeatist approach. August Merges was still a magnet for ambitious young revolutionaries. Many, possibly at the prompting of Schade, gathered around him in order to plan and carry out \\"anti-Nazi actions\\". The \\"Schade resistance group\\" - as this emerging \\"council communist union\\" called itself - developed its ideas out of sight, at least in the short term, implementing a self-imposed ban on \\"outwardly visible actions\\". Along with members of the AAU, it als attracted people who had been Communist Party and SPD members before 1933, as well as young people who had not previously been \\"politically organised\\". In 1934 the group began to show its hand, producing a number of political pamphlet with titles such as \\"Kampfsignal\\" (loosely, \\"Battle call\\"), \\"Der Rote Rebell\\" and \\"Die braune Pest\\" (\\"The brown - i.e. Nazi - plague\\"). These were distributed in and around Braunschweig, presumably left in small piles at tram stops or railway stations, on park benches and bandstands, or in public toilets; wherever those interested might find them. August Merges undoubtedly was one of those working on these anti-government publications. In December 1934 four members of the group were arrested by the police. Six or sixteen more arrests followed in April 1935. Sources differ as to whether August Merges was one of those arrested in April, or whether he was arrested only a few weeks later, on 27 May 1935. During his lengthy interrogation sessions by members of the security services he was subjected to serious physical abuse, suffering pelvic and spinal fractures. According to his son he was unable to stand up after the torture, According to at least one source the extent and duration of his suffering was intensified because, during his detention, treatment of his injuries was forbidden. Merges faced trial, with others, at the district high court in Braunschweig early in October 1935. Found guilty of \\"high treason\\", on 7 October he was given a three year prison term. He served some of his time in the infamous jail at Wolfenb√ºttel. He was also detained for some time at Fuhlsb√ºttel, near Hamburg. Here he was identified and derided as one of the \\"November [1918/19] criminals\\": he was subjected to further physical torture. According to his son his weight sank to 74 (European) pounds, On 27 December 1937 Merges was released, having been deemed unfit for further imprisonment (\\"... wegen Haftunf√§higkeit\\"). Following his release he was immediately taken into \\"protective custody\\" on the personal orders of Braunschweig's National Socialist Minister-President, Dietrich Klagges. However, his son Alfred petitioned the People's Court on his behalf, successfully obtaining a conditional release. The conditions amounted to house arrest, in that Merges was not to leave his registered place of residence, and was forbidden from receiving visitors. August Merges would remain under close security service surveillance for the rest of his life, and was subjected to regular, albeit from now on always brief, further periods of detention at the hands of the security services. In 1943 or 1944 his wife and son Alfred managed to have August Merges relocated to the hut on the family allotment. This seems to have been located where it was easier for his family to look after him, and the allotment hut was sufficiently robust to constitute suitable sleeping accommodation. The allotment was bordered by a civilian internment camp, and he was able to strike up some sort of a relationship with one or two of the Polish and Soviet internees in it, as well as with several \\"reliable\\" (presumably politically reliable as in communist and untainted by National Socialism) German comrades. He was nevertheless still subject to surveillance, and Gestapo officers frequently turned up without warning. By 1945 it was widely accepted that the war would be won by the Soviet Union and its western allies, but August Merges did not survive long enough to experience that fearsome liberation. On 6 March 1945 his wife found him dead in the allotment garden in which he lived.  Celebration  Ever since he emerged on the political stage, August Merges had numerous admirers on the extreme left of the political spectrum. A memorial on behalf of the political mainstream came in 1992, a couple of year after reunification, when his name was included on the \\"Reichstag Memorial\\" to the 96 members of the parliament who died \\"unnaturally\\" during the twelve Hitler years. However, the memorial indicates that he died in the prison at Wolfenb√ºttel. That is incorrect. He died in the hut on his son's allotment garden, which is where he was living at the time. Wolfenb√ºttel prison is nevertheless relevant, since it was one of a number of institutions in which he suffered the physical abuse at the hands of the authorities which caused his early death.

It is 428 km (266 m) in length and runs from the tripoint with Armenia in the west to the tripoint with Russia in the east. Description The border starts in the west at the tripoint with Armenia and proceeds overland to the north-east, cutting through Jandari Lake, before turning to the south-east down to the vicinity of Azerbaijan's Mingachevir reservoir. It then utilises the Alazani river as it flows north-east and then north-west, leaving the river due east of Tsnori and proceeding overland to the Russian tripoint. History During the 19th the Caucasus region was contested between the declining Ottoman Empire, Persia and Russia, which was expanding southwards. Russia formally annexed the eastern Georgian Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti in 1801, followed by the western Georgian Kingdom of Imereti in 1804. Over the course of the 1800s Russian pushed its southern frontier southwards, at the expense of the Persian and Ottoman Empires. By the Russo-Persian War (1804‚Äì1813) and the subsequent Treaty of Gulistan, Russia acquired the bulk of what is now Azerbaijan and parts of Armenia.John F.

Map of the former Tiflis Governorate, with the disputed Zakatala okrug in the east Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, the peoples of the southern Caucasus had declared the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (TDFR) in 1918 and started peace talks with the Ottomans. (Armenian Perspective) (Turkish Perspective) Internal disagreements led to Georgia leaving the federation in May 1918, followed shortly thereafter by Armenia and Azerbaijan, however the borders between the three republic were contested. The dispute between Azerbaijan and Georgia centred on the area of Zakatal Okrug (Zaqatala) within the former Tiflis Governorate. When Russia recognised the independence of Georgia via the Treaty of Moscow (1920), it recognised Georgian ownership of Zakatal, prompting protests by the Azeri government.Lang, DM (1962). A Modern History of Georgia, p. 226. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. In May 1920 it was agreed that a Russian-sponsored delimitation would decide the fate of the area. Much of the border was agreed upon at peace talks held on 12 June 1920, with Zaqatala to be decided by the Russian-led commission. In 1920 Russia's Red Army invaded Azerbaijan and Armenia, ending the independence of both, followed in February-March 1921 by Georgia. On 5 July 1921 Russia confirmed that the non-disputed sections of the Azeri-Georgian border would remain as they were, whilst transferring Zakatal to Azerbaijan, with this arrangement finalised by treaty on 15 November 1921. In 1922 all three states were incorporated into the Transcaucasian SFSR within the USSR, before being separated in 1936. The boundary became an international frontier in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its constituent republics. Work began in 1994 on the delimitation of the border but progress has been slow due to overlapping claims. Part of the border around the Red Bridge remains mined, a legacy of the 1990s Nagorno-Karabakh War when Azerbaijan feared that Armenia would take advantage of chaos in Georgia's and utilise the area to launch attacks on its territory. The site of the David Gareja monastery complex, a sacred site to Georgians which sits directly by the border, has proven especially contentious. There is a sizeable Azeri minority in Georgia, concentrated especially in the southern municipalities of Kvemo Kartli region,Jonathan Wheatley.

Education She read fine art at the University of Reading, graduating in 1972. Fountain trained as a teacher at Brighton Polytechnic, qualifying in 1973. Between January 1975 and June 1977 she was a student at the Royal Academy Schools, where she was taught by Jane Dowling and the portrait painter Peter Greenham, among others. At the Royal Academy she was also a student of Roderic Barrett, and as a former student she took part in an exhibition in his memory at the Chappel Galleries in 2006. =Scholarships= Fountain received two scholarships which are reflected in her work. The first, in 1978, was a bursary from the Government of Italy, dedicated to painting and art history in Perugia. The second in 1983 was a bursary from the Richard Ford Foundation, which was founded by Sir Brinsley Ford \\"to enable young painters to study masterpieces in the Prado,\\" Madrid. Career Much of Fountain's work has been informed by the environment of rural east Kent. She is an established, figurative, still life and landscape artist \\"with a particular interest in colour combinations,\\" and a botanical artist. Her still life artwork includes \\"taxidermy, fossils, exotic plants and vegetables.\\" =Commissioned work= Works by Fountain have been varied, and include the Baptismal Roll (2000) which is an illustrated manuscript now kept at Selling Church, Kent, and portraits of Nigel Nicholson and Claire Palley.

Life  Born in Ulm, Speidel received first musical lessons from his father, singer and composer Konrad Speidel (born 16 September 1804 in S√∂flingen bei Ulm; died 6 January 1880 in Ulm; married to Anna Steiner) and attended the Gymnasium in Ulm. From 1850 until 1853, he studied different subjects only as a guest student at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen due to lack of financial means. Besides, he gave piano lessons and from 1852 he wrote reviews for the Augsburger Allgemeine; his first ('Musikalisches aus M√ºnchen') was published on October 28th. Among his circle of acquaintances in Munich were Friedrich Kaulbach, Ernst F√∂rster, Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer, Justus von Liebig, and . In 1853, Speidel came to Vienna, allegedly to report on the marriage of Empress Elisabeth of Austria to Franz Joseph I. He became friends with Carl Rahl and remained in Vienna, where he subsequently worked for numerous newspapers and magazines, including Pester Lloyd (1854), the Danube (1855-1863), the √ñsterreichische Zeitung (1855-1858), the Jagdzeitung and the Morgenpost (1858), the Neuste Nachrichten (1859) and the Wiener Zeitung (1858/59). He wrote about many topics: Theatre, music, art, chats, humoresques, travel letters, genre pictures among others 1860-1864 he worked for the newspaper Vaterlan. With the foundation of Neuen Freie Presse in 1864, Speidel became its first feature editor for four decades. Around the same time, he was also the music critic of the '. While he wrote for the Presse rather in a chosen language, he used a very popular way of expression in the Fremden-Blatt, which could remind one of joke magazines. He only drew his articles with his full name in very special cases, otherwise only with the soon known abbreviation \\"L. Sp.\\", in the Fremden-Blatt. In addition, he used numerous other ciphers: \\"¬ß\\" (also as art consultant of the Neue Freie Presse) in the (Wiener Zeitung), \\"-l\\", \\"‚ñ°\\", \\"X\\", \\"*\\" among others. Speidel became the most important Viennese critic and feature writer of his time and was known and befriended with many of the greats of Viennese music and theatre life of his time, among others Josef Bayer, Ludwig B√∂sendorfer, Johann von Herbeck, Martin Greif, Ludwig Hevesi, Max Kalbeck, Martin Gustav Nottebohm, Ludwig Porges, Johann Vesque von P√ºttlingen and . He was one of the first to recognise the importance of Johann Nestroy, Adalbert Stifter and Anton Bruckner and paid tribute to the operettas of Johann Strauss II. He had a very negative attitude towards the works of Richard Wagner, which often brought him into sharp contrast with his admirers. Speidel was highly regarded as a theatre critic, in 1887 he was even offered the direction of the Burgtheater, but he refused. About his own work, he once said: \\"I have never proofread a work and never looked at a printed feuilleton again.\\"Ludwig Hevesi: Ludwig Speidel, writer. In Biographical Yearbook and German Necrology. Vol. 11, 1906 (1908), . His wife Leontine (n√©e Ziegelmayer; ‚Ä† 6 January 1903) collected the newspaper clippings which later formed the basis of his collected works published in 1910. His brother was the composer (1826-1899) Speidel died in Vienna at the age of 75. He is buried in a grave dedicated to him in the .  Quotes  The source of these quotations is Ludwig Hevesis' article Ludwig Speidel, Writer in Biographischen Jahrbuch und deutscher Nekrolog (1906). * \\"Das Feuilleton ist die Unsterblichkeit eines Tages.‚Äú * A propos Ludwig Anzengruber: \\"As long as Anzengruber wrote, no other German poet has put more solid content into dramatic forms.\\" * A propos Johannes Brahms: \\"An excellent composer, one of the brightest lights of contemporary German music ...\\", but also \\"... a far too worldly-wise, ironic nature, which looks far too deeply into people to care about their current applause.\\" * Speaking of Anton Bruckner: \\"Mesner figure with the emperor's skull\\" * A propos Grillparzer's ': \\"One of the poets seems so fairy-tale like an enchanted Habsburg prince, condemned by day to be the archives director of the Court Chamber and at night writing down memories of his glorious past\\". * A propos Hans Makart: \\"Where this youthful talent is headed, the gods know. It is to be feared, unfortunately, that it will lose itself in empty virtuosity. * A propos Carl Rahl: \\"For the first time since Schubert, Vienna has again produced a great creative artist, but one treats him as if the geniuses in this country were like thistles' heads.\\" * A propos Ferdinand Raimund: \\"If there was a poet in Vienna, it was Raimund.\\" * A propos Franz Schubert: \\"The greatest symphonist after Beethoven\\". * A propos Richard Wagner: \\"Wagner's music, on the other hand, is thoroughly external, sensual in the bad sense of the word, homely, briefly un-German ...\\" \\"Wagner is artistically not the expression of the German spirit, but only a distortion of it [...] he is an inwardly unproductive, an artificial, hollow, reflected nature ...\\" Later, Speidel's attitude to Wagner softened and he wrote \\"Apart from the values or unvalues of Wagner's music, it has one positive characteristic. The positive thing about it is that it arouses enthusiasm\\". * A propos Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller: \\"Waldm√ºller's artistic heyday was short, hardly filling a decade. His best works fall into the 1940s and, just as he had not really wanted to succeed until then, his career rapidly went downhill from 1848 onwards.\\"  Trivia  In 1888, on the occasion of the demolition of the old Burgtheater, Speidel's two speaker's seats were cut out of the rows of seats and worshipped as a souvenir of their long years of use. When Speidel already belonged to the most important critics of Vienna, his laziness of writing and his lack of time became the talk of the town, as he reported e.g. about premieres before the summer break of the theatres only in the following season in autumn. He was the strictest critic of himself. Nothing he wrote was enough for him. \\"If only I could throw this rubbish into the oven,\\" he sighed when he had just finished a feature article that was the literary event of the next morning.

The summit is above sea level. Tor is an Old English word for a high, rocky hill. The higher peak of Shining Tor is about 2km south along The Tors gritstone ridge. The ridge continues to the north past Windgather Rocks and Taxal Edge towards Whaley Bridge. On the west wide of the ridge, water drains into Todd Brook which feeds Toddbrook Reservoir. East of Cats Tor are views of the popular and historic Goyt Valley, Foxlow Edge and Fernilee Reservoir. The moorland ridge on which Cats Tor lies is designated \\"Open Access\\" land for the public, following the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The closest access is from Pym Chair car park, from where a public footpath, laid on large stone slabs, runs south across Cats Tor and continues south along the ridge to Shining Tor. A local legend tells that Pym Chair is the spot where a highway man called Pym robbed passers by on the packhorse route. However another story is that Pym was a preacher who gave sermons there. The open gritstone moorlands of the Upper Goyt Valley (Wild Moor, Goyt's Moss, Burbage Edge, Shining Tor to Cats Tor ridge and Hop Moor) are a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Heather is the main plant but the heathland is habitat for a variety of native grasses, rushes, sedges and shrubs including bilberry, crowberry, cowberry and cross-leaved heath. Hare‚Äôs-tail cottongrass and sphagnum moss are common along The Tors ridge. The area is important for upland breeding birds including a large population of golden plover, as well as red grouse, curlew, lapwing, whinchat, snipe, twite, ring ouzel and merlin. On 30 September 1943 two Republic P-47D Thunderbolt planes crashed on Cats Tor. Both pilots were killed. The USAAF aircraft were from the 2906th Observation Group. The planes were on a training flight from RAF Atcham. Both aircraft flew straight into the hillside in cloud in the mid-afternoon. Cats Tor is a popular location for paragliding, used by the Derbyshire Soaring Club and the Peak Soaring Association. Oldgate Nick, on the northern slope of Cats Tor, is a gritstone buttress with 15 graded rock climbing routes.

The painting was completed sometime between 1600 and 1625. The painting was acquired by Prince Karl Eusebius von Liechtenstein from the art dealer Peter Bousin between 1674 and 1680, and is currently part of the private collection of the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna. Painting Mountains are a staple in the imaginative landscape painting of de Momper, and this painting is no exception. In this oeuvre, a winding path, upon which separate groups of horsemen are travelling, descends to the viewer. The painting has a unnaturally strong contrast between light and dark. Tones become ever lighter and cooler as they progress to the background, where bluish, misty mountains are discernible in the distance. It has been suggested that de Momper's landscape painting was influenced by his alleged travels to Italy, where he reportedly drew sketches of the Alps. De Momper's landscape paintings are more like \\"memories than empirical records.\\" The huge mountains and cliffs, the \\"unexpected vistas into endless space\\" and \\"the picturesque play of light and atmosphere\\" were his main concerns. Momper worked upon his memories with his imagination, and adjusted the product thereof to the style set by Brueghel and Patinir. Dating While de Momper's works are almost never signed nor dated, they can be ordered into groups according to the style assumed by the Flemish in a given period. Landscape with a Mountain Pass showcases the artist's mature abilities, and may be dated to between 1615 and 1625.

He was a strong supporter of the independence of the Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan.  Early life and the Herzegovina uprising  Lazareviƒá was born in 1838 in Hotanj Hutovski near Neum in Herzegovina, Ottoman Empire. From 1853 until 1865 he was educated in Rome, at the Pontifical Urban University, where he was ordained a priest in 1865. He was appointed a chaplain in Prenj, and in 1867 was appointed a parson in Stolac and a provicar of the Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan, which was at the time administered by the Bishop of Dubrovnik. During the uprising of Christians against the Ottoman Empire in 1875, Lazareviƒá was asked by the Ottoman authorities to try to pacify the Catholics involved in the uprising, however, he failed. Out of fear, he didn't return to his parish, but instead left for Dubrovnik on 1 July 1875. Many other priests also fled for Dalmatia, along with the Catholic population. Many churches and houses were destroyed. After the Austrian-Hungarian occupation in 1878, the situation improved, and the refugees returned to their homes. The churches and schools were being renovated and built and the number of Catholics increased. With the arrival of the Austrian-Hungarian troops, Lazareviƒá led the celebrations across the diocese.  Austrian-Hungarian occupation  During the talks about the organisation of the Church in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Governor of Dalmatia General Gavrilo Rodiƒá and Bishop of Dubrovnik Ivan Zaffron opposed the idea that Trebinje-Mrkan should be exempted from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Dubrovnik, however, the Catholic population and clergy wanted their own bishop. Bishop Ivan Zaffron later supported the initiative, and proposed Apostolic Vicar of Egypt Bishop Ljudevit ƒÜurƒçija as a new bishop of Trebinje- Mrkan. However, the Austrian-Hungarian government couldn't meet these requests due to financial obligations and the consideration for the Eastern Orthodox, as it couldn't allow the Catholics who were fewer in numbers, to have more bishops than the Eastern Orthodox, so they agreed in the Convention of 1881 to leave Trebinje-Mrkan under the administration of the bishop of Dubrovnik. The Catholics of Trebinje-Mrkan became frustrated with the lack of material aid from the new authorities, as well as the inactivity of the new Bishop of Dubrovnik Mato Vodopiƒá. Moreover, Bishop Pa≈°kal Buconjiƒá of Mostar-Duvno systematically usurped northern and north-eastern parts of the Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan for his own diocese. Namely, according to Ex hac augusta, the borders of the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno reached Novi Pazar, while the northern border between the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno and the Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan remained unclear. Lazareviƒá wrote to the Propaganda in Rome on 11 June 1887, requesting again the appointment of the new bishop and protection of Catholics from the new authorities. In Sommer of the same year, Lazareviƒá also wrote to the Austrian-Hungarian government in Sarajevo about Bishop Buconjiƒá's encroachment in Trebinje-Mrkan, however, his petition had no positive answer. Lazareviƒá also warned Bishop of Dubrovnik Mato Vodopiƒá about his duties as Apostolic Administrator, but Bishop Vodopiƒá didn't show much interest. Head of the Propaganda Cardinal Giovanni Simeoni asked the State Secretary Cardinal Mariano Rampolla to help with the improvement of the condition of Catholics in Trebinje-Mrkan. Cardinal Rampolla informed the Pope about the situation, who requested the new negotiations with the Austrian-Hungarian government. Cardinal Luigi Galimberti, the new Nuncio in Vienna, started the negotiations with Foreign Minister Count Gustav K√°lnoky, and presented him Cardinal Rampolla's letter. K√°lnoky in turn informed the Minister of Finances B√©ni K√°llay about the situation, after which in June 1888, K√°llay ordered an investigation about the Bishop Pa≈°kal's pretensions to Trebinje-Mrkan. Again, on 5 September 1888, the clergy of Trebinje-Mrkan asked Nuncio Galimberti for the new bishop and requested that Bishop Buconjiƒá respects the borders of Trebinje-Mrkan, as established in the Papal decree Ex hac augusta of 1881. Finally, on 17 June 1889, the Austrian-Hungarian government in Sarajevo and the Joint Ministry of Finance presented their Proposal to Galimberti, in which they suggested that Bishop of Mostar-Duvno should administer Trebinje-Mrkan. The main motive for such a proposal was not to dissatisfy the Eastern Orthodox population. The Austrian-Hungarian government also requested that the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno, even though just an apostolic administrator, should have a regular jurisdiction in Trebinje-Mrkan and that he could appoint the Franciscans to priestly duties. Cardinals Simeoni and Rampolla agreed with the first proposal, but rejected the latter two. The Austrian-Hungarian government was informed about their decision on 23 September 1889. The Propaganda ordered that the bishop of Mostar-Duvno administers Trebinje-Mrkan on 16 June 1890, a decision confirmed by the Pope on 8 July 1890. With the new decree, Bishop Buconjiƒá extended his jurisdiction over the entire Herzegovina.  Mostar  In 1899, Fr. Vide Putica replaced Lazareviƒá as a parson in Stolac. After Bishop of Mostar-Duvno Pa≈°kal Buconjiƒá took over the administration over Trebinje-Mrkan in 1890, Lazareviƒá moved to Mostar, where he served as an advisor to the bishop for Trebinje-Mrkan. In 1907, he was named general vicar of the two Herzegovinian dioceses. Buconjiƒá died in Mostar on 8 December 1910. As requested by the canon law, on 19 December 1910, the Metropolitan Archbishop Josip Stadler named Lazareviƒá administrator in spiritual matters of the two Herzegovinian dioceses after Buconjiƒá's death. The material care of the dioceses was given to the Franciscan Radoslav Glava≈°. The Franciscans saw Lazareviƒá's appointment as a vicar capitular a prelude to his episcopal nomination and a threat to their interests. The clergy of Trebinje-Mrkan once again asked for its own bishop and requested Lazareviƒá's appointment, and later Anƒëelko Glaviniƒá's, a parson in Trebinje. However, Archbishop Stadler wanted to appoint his own General Vicar Stjepan Hadroviƒá to the episcopal office. The clergy of Trebinje-Mrkan saw this as treason and fiercely opposed the Stadler's plan. Provincial of the Franciscan Province of Bosnia Alojzije Mi≈°iƒá, the government's candidate for the episcopal post, wrote to his fellow Franciscan and Apostolic Administrator of Banja Luka Marijan Markoviƒá, that he was advised from the government that the Franciscans should do everything in their power to retain the episcopal seat in Mostar. After all the frictions about the candidate for bishop in Mostar, the Austrian-Hungarian authorities officially proposed Rome Mi≈°iƒá to the post for the second time on 5 January 1912. The Pope accepted the proposal so Buri√°n asked the Emperor to appoint Mi≈°iƒá, which Emperor did on 14 February. Pope proclaimed Mi≈°iƒá the new bishop on 29 April 1912. Lazareviƒá died in Mostar in 1919 and was buried in front of the church in Gradac, Neum.

While the tribe speaks Sorani Kurdish in Kurdistan Region, the ones in Turkey have kept their tribal sub-dialect of Laki called ≈û√™xbizin√Æ or Kirmancek√Æman. Nonetheless, many in Turkey only know Turkish due to the assimilatory policies of Turkey. They lived around Kermanshah in present-day Iran but were expelled towards Ottoman Kirkuk by Safavid Ismail I in the 16th century. Many members of the tribe would later migrate towards Anatolia. Etymology It is believed that the name of the tribe is a compound of the two words sheikh and Bazan. The latter is the name of the region near Sulaymaniyah where they were exiled to before relocating to Anatolia decades after. The name appears in different spellings in Ottoman documents.  History  The tribe was caught between the many wars between the Ottomans and the Safavids in Kurdistan and where forced to leave towards Kirkuk by the Safavids after failed negotiations between Shah Ismail and ≈û√™xbizin√Æ leader Qaz√Æ H√ªsey√Æn. The reason for the exile was the religious beliefs of the tribe since they were Sunni. Entering Ottoman Kurdistan, they were tolerated by Sultan Selim I since he was attempting to gather support from Sunni Kurdish tribes against the Safavids. Due to the support from the ≈û√™xbizin during the Battle of Chaldiran, the tribe received privileges including the liberty to settle wherever they wanted. This allowed members of the tribe to migrate upward towards Anatolia after temporarily staying in Palu. By the end of the 18th century, the tribe lived in Haymana during the winter and around Antalya, Samsun and Aydƒ±n in the summer. In his work on Kurdish tribes in 1908, Mark Sykes mentioned the ≈û√™xbizin tribe near Kirkuk which numbered around 4,000 families. He wrote: Many ≈û√™xbizin Kurds were Peshmerga and fought with the Kurdish leader Mustafa Barzani during the Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish conflict.

His investigations in bryology and lichenology earned him a world-wide reputation. Biography Stirton taught mathematics from 1856 to 1858 at the Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh. At the University of Edinburgh he graduated in 1857 L.R.C.P.Edin and in 1858 M.D.Edin. Soon after acquiring his M.D. he moved to Glasgow and established an extensive practice in obstetrics and gynaecology. In 1876 Stirton was appointed a lecturer in gynaecology at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where for many years he had charge of the gynaecological wards. In 1889 he became a professor of midwifery at Anderson‚Äôs College Medical School and held the professorship for about fifteen years. Stirton made many visits to the Scottish mountains to investigate lichens and mosses and there discovered numerous species that were previously undescribed. Correspondents from Canada, South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and elsewhere sent him cryptogamic collections for study. He described over 100 new lichen species from Australia, including 8 new lichen species from Tasmania. He contributed the section Cryptogamic Flora (an account of mosses and lichens) to the 1876 book Notes on the Fauna and Flora of the west of Scotland (edited by Edward R. Alston). Stirton served as President of the Glasgow Society of Field Naturalists and contributed numerous articles to the Report and Transactions of the Glasgow Society of Field Naturalists,Glasgow Naturalist, Grevillea, the Scottish Naturalist, the Annals of Scottish Natural History, and other periodicals. Stirton was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London in December 1875 and was a Corresponding Member of several European scientific societies. His cryptogamic herbarium is mostly in the Natural History Museum, London with most of the remainder in the Glasgow Museums. In 1859 he visited Egypt and in 1872 published The Climate of Egypt and Nubia, with Medical Hints to Invalids, &c..; In 1860 he married Jessie McLaren. They had two daughters.

During World War II, about 30 teachers went to the front. During these years, scientists evacuated to Alma-Ata worked at the institute: AI Dushechkin, AA Vasilenko and others. From 1930 to 1950, the institute trained 17 graduates of specialists: 1549 people. Many of them became prominent party and state leaders, heads of farms. In 1950, six faculties began to function within the institute and a five-year term of study was introduced. By 1970, 11,284 students studied at the Kazakh Agricultural Institute, including 4,247 in the full-time department. The teaching staff included 511 people. Personnel training was carried out in 15 specialties. In 1971, Kazakh Agricultural Institute was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. From 1985 to 1995, the institute had already 12 faculties. In 1981‚Äì1982, over 10 thousand students studied at the institute, 541 teachers worked, including 2 corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh SSR, corresponding member of the VASKhNIL, 21 professors and doctors of sciences, 222 associate professors and candidates of sciences. = Merger and present = In 1996, through the merger of the Almaty Zooveterinary and Kazakh Agricultural Institute, the Kazakh State Agrarian University (KazGAU) was created, the rector of which was appointed Academician of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kenjegali Sagadiev. In 2001, by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, the university was assigned a special status of a national higher educational institution.  Faculties  * Faculty of Agrobiology and Phytosanitary * Faculty of Technology and Bioresources * Faculty of Veterinary Medicine * Faculty of forestry, land resources and horticulture * Faculty of Hydraulic Engineering, Land Reclamation and Business * Faculty of Engineering  Campus  Kazakh Agricultural Institute campus building The main building of the university was built in two stages in 1934 and 1954. In 1934, according to the project of the architect N. Petrov, the left wing was built, and in 1954 the central part and the right wing of the building were completed according to the design of V. Biryukov. In architectural terms, the building consists of three parts and was built in classic style characteristics with elements of national decor. There is a portico of the main entrance in front of the central three-story projection. Its piers contain multifaceted paired and single semi-columns with ornamental capitals and developed bases. Arches of the \\"eastern type\\" have a complex ornamented archivolt. The developed cornice has two tiers of figured brackets. The central and corner zones of the parapet are deaf. An arched balustrade is placed between them. In the center, above the parapet, there is a two-figured sculptural composition with a coat of arms. The doors behind the portico have a wide ornamented casing. Two-tiered stained-glass windows follow the contour of the arches. The risalit windows outside the portico are rectangular with simple frames. A two-part interfloor belt is located at the level of the third floor window sill. The main volume of the building is two-storied with a plinth passing into the basement. The walls of the basement have a large rustication. In the corners there are three-column porticoes-loggias with square fluted columns and a simple slab capital. The columns are crowned with a multi-stepped developed entablature. Similar columns and pilasters are used in the loggias and in the framing of the stained-glass windows of the vestibules. The windows of the main and side facades have complex-profile platbands. The windows on the courtyard facade are made without platbands. In its central part, the cornice is broken in the form of a semi-pediment, and pseudopilasters with an ornamental cartouche of the capital are made in the piers of the windows. In early 2000's, a large- scale reconstruction of the main building of the university was carried out, while maintaining the main elements of the facade design. On 10 November 2010, a new State List of Historical and Cultural Monuments of Local Significance of the city of Almaty was approved, simultaneously with which all previous decisions on this matter were declared invalid. In this Resolution, the status of a local monument of the main building was preserved. The boundaries of the protected zones were approved in 2014.

It is dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God. Origins The local Orthodox community mainly lived in the Velen»õa and Ora»ôul Nou districts, and was composed of Romanians, Serbs, Aromanians and Greeks. A number of them acquired substantial wealth, were prominent in city life and wished to build a grand church. Two rich, influential judges on the appeals court, noblemen devoted to the Orthodox faith, obtained an audience with Joseph II. They argued that the city‚Äôs only Orthodox church, located in Velen»õa, was too far from other Orthodox areas. In spite of protests, permission was granted, and the Bishop of Arad, Petar Petroviƒá, presided over the cornerstone laying. This is recorded in Greek, Romanian and Serbian inscriptions.

In the summer of 1786, following several days of torrential rain, the structure partly collapsed. Work was completed in 1790, with the first services taking place in November. Once the interior painting was done, the church was consecrated, in 1832. Description at the Oradea Tourism Office site Description Panoramic view The style is late Baroque with clear classicizing elements, as well as a decided provincial stamp. The interior strictly adheres to the norms of Byzantine architecture. The keystone above the iconostasis used to feature a portrait of Vasile Ursu Nicola, better known as the revolt leader Horea and usually considered the only authentic depiction of his face. Today, a copy stands in its stead; the original is at the Oradea Diocese museum. The nickname derives from a mechanism installed in the spire in 1793. The clock and moon are the work of an innovative local mechanic, Georg Rueppe. The mechanism that turns the moon is designed to complete a whole rotation around its axis every 28 days, thus indicating the phases of the moon, based on the daily cycle marked by the clock mechanism. The anchoring wheel of the clock is engraved in German with the designer‚Äôs name and hometown.

It is found growing in very shallow water on reefs in the Indo-Pacific region. It sometimes forms \\"microatolls\\" in the intertidal zone and these massive structures have been used to study trends in sea levels and sea water temperature. Description Porites lutea forms massive, smooth, hemispherical mounds or helmet-shaped colonies up to across. The corallites have thin walls and are closely packed, some in diameter. In contrast to Porites lobata, the corallites are well-filled with skeletal elements, including five tall pali near the centre. The colour of this coral is usually cream or yellow, but other bright colours sometimes occur in shallow-water habitats. Distribution and habitat Porites lutea is native to the tropical Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from Madagascar and the east coast of Africa to Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan and northern and eastern Australia. It occurs on back reef margins, in lagoons and on fringing reefs. It is a common species, often occurring with Porites australiensis and Porites lobata. Ecology This coral can form \\"microatolls\\" in the intertidal zone; these are disc-shaped mounds with dead coral material at the top and living material round the perimeter which continues to grow sideways. Sometimes these structures remain as fossil microatolls in which no living polyps survive but the colony morphology is retained. Fossil microatolls of Porites lutea, combined with precise dating of individual annual growth rings using the uranium‚Äìthorium dating method, allows these structures to be used to determine past relative changes in sea-level. Their use for this purpose on reefs in the South China Sea has shown that during the period 7000‚Äì6550 years before 2000, the sea level was about higher than now, with four or more cycles of fluctuations. In Yemen, the non-native, invasive, encrusting red sponge Clathria aceratoobtusa grows over the surface of the coral, at the rate of about per month, smothering and killing it. A thin white line of dead tissue separates the healthy coral tissues from the advancing sponge. Sometimes fragments of Porites lutea become detached from colonies. These may remain alive and end up further down the reef slope, or moved to a new location by currents or waves; in this way new colonies or even new reefs may form in locations unsuitable for larval settlement. Research The growth rate of corals is influenced by environmental conditions; massive corals lay down a band of calcium carbonate each year, and the thickness of the band indicates the rate of growth. Researchers in Indonesia have studied the growth rate of Porites lutea and correlated it with the El Ni√±o phenomenon. Growth rates were higher on windward slopes with greater wave action, and lower on lee slopes with less water movement. Rates were at their highest in 1992, when the sea temperature was about , and at their lowest in 1998 when it was . The correlation between water temperature and growth rate was complex, but in general growth rates of the coral were lower when the coral was stressed by higher water temperatures. Exposure of Porites lutea to increased concentration of iron causes bleaching through loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae; however the effect is less marked in corals previously exposed to raised levels of iron, suggesting the development of tolerance to the metal.

Themed to the Jurassic World franchise, the coaster is set to open in July 2021. History In May 2018, a permit was filed for the demolition of the defunct Triceratops Encounter walk-through attraction. In mid-January 2019, the stalls and games around the area were removed and a construction wall was erected. A drawing of the layout was also leaked. On June 25, 2019, two weeks after the opening of Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, new Intamin roller coaster track pieces were spotted on the property. It was confirmed that the track would be double-spined, much like Skyrush at Hersheypark. During the 2019 fall season, the land was cleared between Popeye and Bluto's Bilge-Rat Barges and the Hogsmeade area of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. To prevent derbis from floating into the lagoon, a bouy line was installed around the surrounding area. Concrete footers began to be poured in December. When Universal Orlando Resort closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, construction of the coaster was picking up speed. The first segments of track had been added. A new Raptor Encounter was being built next to the Jurassic Park: River Adventure and the Pizza Predattoria restaurant. When the resort reopened in June, sections of track were already being built near the Jurassic Park Discovery Center and the Flying Broomsticks restaurant. Later on, the dive loop, zero-g stall and heartline roll were completed. The ride's top hat was topped off on July 8, 2020. This was said to be the highest point. A Jurassic World flag was put underneath the track. By August, the Jr. Immelmann was complete. In addition, trim brakes were installed on the top hat. Then, the entire track layout was finshed on September 3. A pull-through test was conducted on September 16. Around the same time, scenery was being installed, such as a mountain, rockwork, electric fences and dinosaur sculptures. On September 28, 2020, Universal Orlando Resort announced that the new coaster would be named VelociCoaster. Characteristics VelociCoaster will be an Intamin Blitz Coaster similar to Maverick at Cedar Point and Taron at Phantasialand. The ride will feature a outside top hat with a 80 degree drop and a Jr. Immelmann. It would also have several inversions such as a dive loop, a zero-g stall and a heartline roll. VelociCoaster will have two LSM launches with one being from 0 to in 2.4 seconds. Each train will feature six cars which seat riders two abreast, giving a maximum capacity of 24 riders.

Choral music  In 1906 he founded the Glasgow Bach Choir: since the original Bach Choir in London was established in 1875 with the aim of performing Bach's B minor mass in its entirety, the popularity of Bach's music resulted in similar choirs being formed over the country. Diack also made several English translations of choral works of Bach and Handel for Breitkopf & H√§rtel, one of the main musical publishing houses.  Scottish country dance  In 1923 he became one of the founding members of the Scottish Country Dance Society when he suggested a meeting with Jean Milligan and Ysobel Stewart, who, as principal organisers, rapidly built up the Society. In 1951. under George VI and the future Queen, it became the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society. Diack arranged settings of numerous dances for the publishing company Paterson Sons & Co of Wigmore Street, London, and Buchanan Street, Glasgow.

Biography  Al Khadra was born circa 1938 in Tiris. Her family were Bedouin and her childhood was spent moving through the region so her family could find grazing for their animals. She learnt poetry from a young age by listening to others perform. The first poetry she learnt celebrated female beauty, but after the movement for self-determination from Spain started in the 1970s, her poetry changed to become socially conscious and celebrate the military achievements of the Polisario. Al Khadra is one of several poets, whose work has become a vital part of cultural resistance for the Sahrawi people. She is the only female Sahrawi poet to have documented the Western Sahara War from 1976 to 1991. Subjects of her poems include the Moroccan Western Sahara Wall, also known as the Berm; the Polsario's first tank; the refutation of 'Moroccanisation' of her homeland; and providing fuel for 'revolution'. In 1975, she was forced to move to the Tindouf refugee camp by the Moroccan army. In 2012 she was living in the El Aai√∫n refugee camp.  Media  Al Khadra's granddaughter is the singer Aziza Brahim, who has performed poetry by her grandmother worldwide.

Myers was born to Anglo-Indian parents in Bangalore. His father worked for Indian Railways. His career in radio started in Ghana, where he arrived as a teenager in 1957, three days before independence. Myers became friends with Smokey Hesse, who hosted Jazz Scene on Radio Ghana and let Myers regularly sit in during broadcasts. One day, Smokey realised he had forgotten his script at home, rushed back to get it, and was hit by a bus and killed. Sitting in the studio, and unaware of the accident, Myers was asked to fill in and present the programme instead. He did it so well that he was hired as a broadcaster at the station. He became the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation's top radio personality and the favourite radio voice of Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah. While in Accra, organized a weekly discotheque session that helped popularize rock and roll in the capital and also directed the country's first musical and helped found what became the country's national theatre. During the Congo Crisis he and friends went to Katanga to entertain United Nations peacekeepers in the Congo. Later, Myers was part of a troupe that included an orchestra, and 85 dancers that was sent to Moscow to perform. On the strength of his success at Radio Ghana, he was hired in 1963 by the BBC External Service (BBC World Service since 1965) as the first host of Good Morning Africa for the BBC African Service. On the programme, he \\"anarchically scattered jokes, competitions and fictional guests like the American Vietnam commander ‚ÄòGeneral Wastemoreland‚Äô between the ‚Äòpop, politics and personalities‚Äô of the programme‚Äôs sub-title.\\" Myers's success gave him celebrity in Africa, with fans gathering in the thousands to greet him at airports. Myers was in the cohort of DJs who launched BBC Radio 1 in 1967\\"RADIO ONCE UPON A TIME\\", by Tammy Hughes, The Daily Mirror, 30 September 2017 sharing duties with Terry Wogan presenting Late Night Extra, while also continuing on the BBC Africa Service. He was constrained on his Radio 1 show by the station's restrictive playlist and policies, denying him the on air freedom he had on the World Service. He also began presenting a weekend programme on BBC Africa, PM, named after his initials, where he would interview celebrities such as Shirley Bassey, Carol Channing, David Lean, Stephen Sondheim, Ingrid Bergman, and Sophia Loren. In the early 1970s, the success of Good Morning Africa promoted the World Service to make it the flagship morning programme across the English section as The Good Morning Show, also presented by Myers. He left the BBC in 1974, after 11 years, and moved to Beirut, Lebanon where he opened a nightclub, the Crazy Horse Saloon, only to close it down a few weeks later when the Lebanese Civil War broke out. He moved to Turkey, where he attempted to start another nightclub, before returning to broadcasting in 1976 when he joined Radio Netherlands, where he produced and presented English-language documentaries, features, and other programming aimed at Africa and Asia, as well as for the English section generally, presenting and producing programmes such as Afroscene, Mainstream Asia, Asiascan, Rembrandt Express, and 50+.

The home was built in 1930 for the Baptist Old People's Home organization, which was founded in Maywood in 1906; the large- scale building replaced its original, smaller facilities. At the time, retirement care was shifting from family-centered to institutional practices, and the elderly began to choose retirement home living instead of being forced there by a lack of family or money. When it opened, the facility was racially segregated and only admitted white residents; it also restricted membership to members of the Baptist faith who were over seventy years old. Architect Elmer C. Roberts designed the Tudor Revival building, which features half-timbering on its upper stories, towers enclosing its stairwells, and projecting bays topped by crenellated parapets. Additions were placed on the building in 1955 and 1965 to expand its capacity. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 26, 2017.

XBI uses linearly polarized X-rays with an energy tuned to an elemental absorption edge. The tuned X-rays interact solely with the absorbing element, thus allowing the local anisotropy of the bonding environment of the X‚Äëray absorbing element to be studied. Due to the requirement of linearly polarized tunable X-rays a synchrotron source is necessary. Interaction with the bonding environment of the selected element in the sample changes the incident X-ray polarization plane. A polarization analyzer is used to diffract the rotated component of the polarization plane to an area detector. The greater the vertical component of the polarization plane the greater the intensity observed on the detector. In this way, it is possible to study the distribution of bond environments containing the X-ray absorbing element in a spatially resolved manner. The XBI technique has been shown to be a sensitive method for spatially resolved mapping of the local orientational properties of anisotropic materials. In the case of organic materials, the technique may be applied to study the orientational properties of individual molecules and/or bonds (most applications of the technique so far have focused on studies of orientational ordering of C‚ÄìBr bonds, from XBI measurements carried out using incident linearly polarized X-rays tuned to the bromine K-edge). Applications of the technique have included the study of changes in molecular orientations associated with order-disorder phase transitions in solids and characterization of phase transitions in liquid crystalline materials. XBI can also be exploited for spatially resolved analysis of orientationally distinct domains in materials, giving information the sizes of domains, the orientational relationships between domains, and the nature of domain boundaries.

Malik Bajar Khan was a minor chieftain in Kach Mekran, the westernmost province of Balochistan. The descendants of Bajar Khan, who had a strong Mughal alliance, spread their principality throughout northern India, and strongly opposed the Sikh and British Empire.  History  Malik Bajjar Khan was given zamindari rights over the Thal territory about Shahpur by Babur. He settlednear Khushab. His son and successor Gul Bhalak Khan obtained from Humayun the territory around Sahiwal. His successors served the Mughal government one after the other. In 1530, he Bajjar Khan died and was succeeded by his son Gul Bhalak Khan, who founded several new villages in the Shahpur region and defeated the Khatk tribes with a great massacre in the place named after the battle, Haddanwala (Haddi bone) from a huge number of those killed, whose bones whitewashed the plain for a long time. The village is now known as Khadali . He received from the Emperor a piece of land around Sahiwal, which he settled and introduced into culture. He died in 1547. * Hot Khan. Little is known about this man or about his two closest successors, Mubarak Khan and Budha Khan. * Sahib Khan, the sixth leader of the Sahiwal, was a man of such cruel and oppressive mood that people rebelled against his power and, having overthrown him, made his nephew Langar Khan ruler. * Langar Khan was frivolous and greatly improved his territory, paying great attention to agriculture. Fearing that his four sons (Lal Khan, Mubarak Khan, Bayram Khan and Lashkar Khan) from different wives might quarrel, he built a separate fort for each in the vicinity of Sahiwal, one of which stood in the days of British India. This remarkable method of ensuring peace was not crowned with success, and after the death of Langar Khan in 1735, his sons began to quarrel with each other. * Lal Khan, the elder, held on to his rights and killed his brother Bayram Khan. Lashkar Khan and his nephew Kanun Khan felt safe. When Ahmad Shah Durani first invaded India, Lal Khan gave him every assistance in delivering supplies. Prince Durrani treated him with such respect that Mubarak Khan, his only remaining brother, became jealous of his fame and, having entered into an agreement with Fath Khan from Bukharianwal, sent great forces against him. In the battle that followed, Lal Khan was defeated and killed. * Fatah Khan was only twelve years old when he succeeded his father. He was an intelligent boy and soon avenged his father's death by forcing Mubarak Khan and his family to take refuge in Bahawalpur. Fatah Khan's reign was short-lived. He was taken prisoner during the Afghans invasion, taken to Dera Ismail Khan and executed there. He had no son left, and his two brothers were so young that their mother Bhandi took over the management. * Bhandi had courage and ability, and the Baloch clans obeyed her, and her only fault was that she was a woman. In 1750, Raja Kura Mai, lieutenant of Ahmad Shah Durrani, arrived in Sahiwal and summoned the little leaders to him. Bhandi suspected betrayal and, refusing to obey, called the troops to arms and attacked Raja, but was completely defeated. The children were taken prisoner and, it is believed, executed. *Mubarak Khan now thought his turn was come, and, returning from Bahawalpur, assumed the chiefship without much opposition, and held it till his death, in 1770. *His son Muhammad Khan found it difficult to make head against the Sikhs who were at this time overruning the country. Sirdar Jhanda Singh Bhangi attacked Sahiwal but was repulsed though he took possession of a portion of the territory. Muhammad Khan at length succeeded in recovering this with some loss, but was assassinated soon afterwards by some Sikhs and Baloches, who had come to Sahiwal on pretence of paying him a complimentary visit. *Allah-yar Khan having punished his father's (Muhammad Khan) murderers turned his attention to the improvement of the country, and was engaged in cutting a canal from the Jhelam, when he was killed by a fall from his horse. *Fatah Khan the fourteenth chief was a minor at the time ofhis brother's death, and for some time his mother Allah Jowahi acted as regent, in conjunction with Diwan Dya Ram. When the boy grew up he determined to seize the power which his mother and the Diwan seemed to wish to retain, and his bold policy was completely successful. He then turned his arms against the Sikhs and recovered from them the forts of Nihang and Shaikh Jalil. From Mit Singh Bhangi he took Derah Jarah, and soon became dreaded for his energy and courage. On all sides he recovered ancestral possessions and acquired new ones, till he at length ruled over a larger tract of country than any of his predecessors, and his revenue amounted to about 1,50,000 Rs. When Mahan Singh rose to power Fatah Khan thought it politic to pay him a small tribute; and in 1804 he agreed to give Ranjit Singh yearly, 25 horses and 25 camels. This tribute was, in 1809, commuted to 12,000 Rs. per annum.

He was raised and educated in Concord, New Hampshire, and graduated from Professor Amos Hadley‚Äôs Private School in Concord. He attended Tufts College for two years. Start of career In 1900, Harvey began a business career as a traveling salesman for the Fitchburg Hardware Company. He remained with the company for 11 years, when he bought a hardware store in Chester, Vermont. Harvey owned and operated the store until he became Vermont‚Äôs U.S. Marshal. A Republican, Harvey served on the party's committee in Windsor County for many years. He served several terms as Chester‚Äôs town agent in the 1920s and 1930s. He was a justice of the peace and also served as a trustee of Chester Academy and president of the Chester Board of Trade. United States Marshal In May 1922, Vermont‚Äôs Congressional delegation recommended Harvey to succeed Arthur P. Carpenter as the state‚Äôs U.S. Marshal. President Warren G. Harding concurred and nominated Harvey in June. When Calvin Coolidge succeeded to the presidency on August 3, 1923 while staying at his family‚Äôs home in Plymouth, Vermont, Harvey arrived in Plymouth about three hours after Coolidge was sworn in. Swiftly deputizing several local residents, Harvey took the initiative to provide a bodyguard detail for Coolidge. The guards remained with Coolidge until Secret Service agents from Boston took over the duty after they caught up to his train in Rutland while he was returning to Washington, D.C. For most of his term, Harvey was heavily involved in efforts to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment, which prohibited the manufacture, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages. He continued to serve as U.S. Marshal until June 1935, when he was succeeded by Edward L. Burke. Later life After leaving the marshal‚Äôs office, Harvey frequently carried out duties as a commissioner appointed by the Windsor County Probate Court to settle the estates of individuals who had died without wills. In 1938, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Windsor County Sheriff. In the 1940s, he served as Chester‚Äôs town grand juror. During World War II, he was appointed as the appeal agent for Windsor County Draft Board Number 2. Harvey was a longtime member of the Masons and was a member of Chester‚Äôs St. Luke‚Äôs Episcopal Church.

The French Interior Minister G√©rald Darmanin considered this to be \\"clearly an act of Islamist terrorism.\\" A man from Pakistan, suspected of carrying out the attacks, was arrested near the scene. Six other suspects were subsequently arrested in Paris in connection with the attack.  Background  According to a researcher at the Atlantic Council, the immigration of young males from countries such as Pakistan, which have become increasingly Islamicized and anti-Western, into Europe result in culture collisions. Also, ghettos are forming around Muslim immigrants in the Western countries where they end up; they are turning to their religion as a defence mechanism or point of focus.  Suspect  The main suspect was identified as Zaheer Hassan Mehmood, a 25-year-old man, who is charged with \\"attempted murder in association with a terrorist enterprise.\\" The suspect acknowledged having carried out the attack for religious reasons. His age was unclear in France, as he claimed to be 18 in order to benefit from social welfare benefits. Before the attack, he stated in a video that he was seeking vengeance against Charlie Hebdo for publishing caricatures of Islam's prophet Muhammad. The suspect left his village in the Punjab region in Pakistan, in early 2018 time frame so he could be smuggled to Europe, following the example set by his brothers who were among the least 18 young men from the village who have left to reach Europe. According to Associated Press, villagers considered the suspect a hero for carrying out the Paris attack. The suspect's father championed his son's actions, but was later warned by Pakistani police to speak publicly. In France, the suspect moved to Pantin, a working-class district with immigrants from North Africa, Sub- Saharan Africa and Pakistan.

He was a leader of the church in Upper Egypt and Lower Nubia. He wrote in both Arabic and Coptic. His works include theology, Coptic grammar and poetry. His primary dialect was Sahidic. Life He wrote in Arabic a grammar of the Coptic language entitled Necklace of Composition in the Science of Interpretation.; translates it Necklace of Writing for the Science of Translation. The Arabic is QilƒÅdat al-ta·∏•rƒ´r fƒ´  øilm al-tafsƒ´r. Most of what is known about his life comes from this work. He was born at Qamulah on the right bank of the Nile, the son of a priest named Salib. He entered the nearby monastery of Mar Buqtur on the left bank of the Nile before succeeding Gabriel as bishop of the fortified city of Qus. In 1371‚Äì1372, he took part in the consecration and enthronement of Timothy as bishop of Qasr Ibrim. In 1374, during the patriarchate of Gabriel IV, he took part in the concoction of the chrism (myron) and wrote a description of the Upper Egyptian rite. In the past, his activity was sometimes dated to the eleventh century, but the evidence points towards the second half of the fourteenth. The Berlin manuscript of the Necklace contains a preface to a different (lost) grammar in which the Ecclesiastical Ladder of Yuhanna al-Samannudi is mentioned. If this preface was written by Athanasius, as seems likely, his dates must be pushed back at least to the second half of the thirteenth century. He is not mentioned in any thirteenth-century grammars or dictionaries, nor is he in the index of authors of Ibn Kabar (died 1324). His episcopate corresponds to a rough period for the Copts of Upper Egypt. The city of Qus was targeted by the Banu al-Kanz, who lost their control of Makuria in 1365. There were also outbreaks of plague in 1374‚Äì1375 and 1379‚Äì1381, Nile floods in 1360, 1376, 1382 and 1395, and famines in 1374‚Äì1375 and 1394‚Äì1396. There were even new martyrs in Qamulah in 1378. Works Athanasius' Necklace was originally composed in the Sahidic dialect, but a Bohairic version also exists. Athanasius himself records that these were the only two surviving dialects of Coptic, Bashmuric being extinct by his time. This is, however, the earliest reference to a Bashmuric dialect, which has not been conclusively identified in any of surviving Coptic text. Athanasius' Necklace, moreover, is the first major treatment of Sahidic and he also wrote a commentary (shar·∏•) on his Sahidic grammar. A Sahidic sullam (Copto-Arabic dictionary) is also attributed to him. The Sahidic in Athanasius' account of the rite of the chrism was supplied by his colleague Gabriel, bishop of al-Marg. This is one of the latest descriptions of the unique Upper Egyptian rite. The lost grammar prefaced in the Berlin manuscript, titled Sufficiency of the Seeker,Arabic Bulghat al-·π≠ƒÅlibƒ´n. was in the form of a didactic poem in which Sahidic homonyms were explained through Arabic. Besides his grammatical works, Athanasius also composed poetry between 1365 and 1378. He may also be the author of the Triadon, a long poem in Sahidic that survives in a single manuscript with an Arabic translation. The poet describes himself as a monk from Upper Egypt who moved to Lower Egypt and used his native tongue in order to demonstrate its suitability. His theological works include a treatise (arguzah) on baptism and another in the form of 100 questions from the Canons of the Apostles. Athanasius' is \\"one of the last names that can be mentioned for the 13th- and 14th-century golden age of Copto-Arabic literature\\". His ambit and his preference for Sahidic are representative of the southward shift of the Coptic centre of gravity under the Mamluks. The shar·∏• he wrote on his own grammar was the main source for Raphael Tuki's Rudimenta linguae coptae sive aegyptiacae ad usum Collegii Urbani de Propaganda Fide (1778).

He was the brother of Louis II, Count of Montpensier, Charles III, Duke of Bourbon (also known as The Constable of Bourbon), Louise de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier, and Ren√©e of Bourbon (who became Duchess of Lorraine on 26 June 1515, less than three months before Fran√ßois's untimely death). Life Francis I of France made Fran√ßois de Bourbon Duke of Ch√¢tellerault in 1514. Fran√ßois de Bourbon was the third and youngest son of Gilbert, Count of Montpensier and his noble Italian wife Clara Gonzaga, with both of Fran√ßois's parents dying before he even became a teenager. Fran√ßois fought loyally under the command of his elder brother Charles in Guyenne and Navarre and was rewarded and compensated for his services by Francis I of France (through letters patent) with the Duchy of Ch√¢tellerault (named after the French city of Ch√¢tellerault, alternatively spelled Chatellraud, in Nouvelle-Aquitaine) in February 1514. Fran√ßois de Bourbon was killed in action on 13 September 1515 at the Battle of Marignano (in what is now the northern Italian city of Melegnano, in Lombardy) against the Swiss during the Italian Wars. After Fran√ßois's untimely death, his elder brother Charles, who was already Duke of Bourbon, inherited the Duchy of Ch√¢tellerault. After Charles's death in 1527 during the Sack of Rome, French King Francis I's mother Louise of Savoy inherited the Duchy of Ch√¢tellerault, with it reverting to the royal domain after Louise's death in 1531. Subsequently, the Duchy of Ch√¢tellerault was given to Charles II de Valois, Duke of Orl√©ans, the third and youngest son of Francis I of France. Fran√ßois de Bourbon never married but was nevertheless rumored to have had an illegitimate daughter (or natural daughter) named Isabelle de Bourbon (who alleged married a Spaniard named Laurent Suarez, the Count of Corunna), but this has never actually been proven.

The battle ended in a Seleucid victory and the Parthians becoming Seleucid vassals  Background  The region of Parthia had split off from the Seleucid Empire around 245 BC when its governor Andragoras had declared his independence following the death of Seleucid king Antiochus II and the subsequent seizure of the Seleucid capital Antioch by the Egyptians. He was soon overthrown by the Parni tribe, led by Arsaces the First, who then claimed the kingship of Parthia. The Parni would rule Parthia unopposed for 3 decades.  Prelude  However the Seleucids ended their conflict with Egypt and the Seleucid monarch Antiochus the Great began looking to regain the lost eastern territories. In early 209 BC he entered Media and began preparing to cross a stretch of waterless desert (most likely the Sirjan salt desert), that if successfully traversed would lead him to the Parthian capital Hecatompylos. When the current Parthian king Arsaces the Second heard of this he sent men to destroy the main underground wells along the route, however these men were met by 1000 Seleucid horsemen under a commander known as Nicomedes and were dispersed. Antiochus was then able to cross the desert and arrived at Hecatompylos. Arsaces‚Äôs much smaller Parthian army retreated to find a battle site that gave them a chance of victory and Antiochus pursued them after a brief stay at Hecatompylos. The Parthians retreated into the neighbouring region of Hyrcania, which required armies to travel though narrow passes over the Alborz mountains, the major one being the pass over Mt Labus. Here the Parthians prepared to stop Antiochus  Battle  Antiochus knew attempting to force his full army through the pass would be suicide and instead split his army into many companies who would take different smaller routes over the mountains. In front was a detachment of Cretans shields led by Polyxenidas of Rhodes and many skirmishers led by a man only known as Diogenes. The rear was brought up by mainly infantry led by Nicolaus of Aetolia and the aforementioned Nicomedes. The march proved difficult, with Antiochus‚Äôs army fighting tough weather, which caused many trees and rocks to fall and block the Seleucids way. The Parthians had also constructed blockades and positioned groups of soldiers on the different high points in the pass. This would‚Äôve made it impossible for a purely phalanx army to make it through, however the Parthians failed to prepare for the light skirmishers led by Diogenes and this would be their downfall. Each time the Seleucids saw a group of Parthians Diogenes‚Äôs company climbed to points above the enemy and proceeded to harass and kill them until they retreated. This pattern continued for seven days as Antiochus moved up the mountain. However as the Seleucids neared the summit the Parthians had finally caught on to the tactic and instead all resolved to fight Antiochus on the summit. On the eighth the day the two forces fought each other. The battle between the infantry was a surprisingly close contest, and the Parthians may have possibly prevailed. However once again Diogenes found an alternative route across the summit and appeared behind the Parthians. This caused panic in Arsaces‚Äôs army and they routed, allowing the Seleucids to enter Hyrcania.  Aftermath  Antiochus first took Tambrax, a large unwalled city. Most of its inhabitants fled to the walled Sirynx, which was then put under siege by Antiochus. The siege was hard fought but Antiochus‚Äôs numbers eventually allowed him to force through the defences. After the fall of Sirynx Arsaces knew all was lost and surrendered to Antiochus. Arsaces now ruled Parthia as a vassal of the Seleucid Empire. This state of affairs wouldn‚Äôt last long however, as after the Seleucid defeat against the Romans at Magnesia they began a century long decline, which allowed the Parthians to free themselves again, and eventually conquer all of Persia to become one of the Middle East‚Äôs dominant powers.

The building that currently houses the club is historical and built in 1916 in a Tudor-Craftsman style, and is located at 475 Homer Avenue in Palo Alto. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.  Club history  The Woman's Club of Palo Alto was initially founded on June 20, 1894 by 24 women who gathered at a Presbyterian Church in Palo Alto, California. The first president was Mary Grafton Campbell, a doctor. Early members of the club included Anna Zschokke, a figure in the establishment of the Palo Alto Unified School District; Lydia Mitchell, she co-founded the Palo Alto Red Cross; and Julia Gilbert, a figure in the establishment of the Palo Alto libraries. In 1898, the club formed a circulating library and donated over 2,000 books, which four years later led to the first public library in Palo Alto. In 1911, the club worked for California women's suffrage movement. From 1916 until 1929, the club members were involved in local and national issues concerning World War I, universal suffrage, and women in politics. The club has hosted many speaking events including suffragist Hester Ann Harland, lectures by Stanford University professors, among others. In 2018, many female engineers and university students met at the club to discuss cryptocurrencies and the club served as a safe space for women in technology to meet.  Architectural history  Club members raised money to buy a lot on Homer Avenue, and it took a decade to raise the remaining money for the building construction. The total cost of the new club building was $10,590. Charles Edward Hodges (1864‚Äì1944) was the architect of the building. The style of the building is a Tudor Craftsman design. The exterior features are Craftsman with a porte-cochere doorway, heavy beams, stucco finish with a painted wood wainscoting band of lap siding at the base of the structure. The Tudor design elements include the one and a half story gable, a half timbered frame and a steeply pitched roof. The interior features a Ballroom with maple flooring and fir board and batten siding on three of the walls, and a stage with an Olio drop front curtain. There is a separate Fireside Room with salt glazed tiles from 1910 made by the Steiger Terracotta and Pottery Company of South San Francisco.

It was a courtroom drama written by Abby Mann and directed by George Roy Hill that depicts the trial of four German judicial officials as part of the Nuremberg trials. Claude Rains starred as the presiding judge with Maximilian Schell as the defense attorney, Melvyn Douglas as the prosecutor, and Paul Lukas as the former German Minister of Justice. A scene featuring Claude Rains referring to the Nazis' \\"gas ovens\\" was cut from the audio during the broadcast due to an objection by a gas-company sponsor. The gas company did not want gas appliances to be associated with the horror of Nazi Germany. In 1961, Judgment at Nuremberg was adapted into a film of the same name starring Spencer Tracy and Burt Lancaster, and with Maximilian Schell and Werner Klemperer reprising their roles from the teleplay. Plot =Act I= The play begins with narration by Telford Taylor describing the Nuremberg trials. Captain Byers (played by Martin Milner), the court's adjutant, escorts Judge Haywood (played by Claude Rains), a New England country judge, and his wife to their luxurious living quarters in Nuremberg. In scenes interspersed with actual footage of Nuremberg under the Nazis, Byers takes Haywood on a tour of Nuremberg's bomb- damaged ruins and of Zeppelin Field. The trial begins with Judge Haywood presiding. The defendants are Ernst Janning (played by Paul Lukas), the former Minister of Justice, two judges (Hoffstetter and Lammpe), and the public prosecutor (Hahn). The American prosecutor, General Parker (played by Melvyn Douglas), presents his opening argument. He accuses the defendants of constructing the legal framework for crimes of execution, enslavement, and extermination. Defense attorney Oscar Rolfe (played by Maximilian Schell) presents his opening statement. He describes Janning as a great legal scholar and advocate of democracy who remained in office to save the judiciary from complete domination by Hitler. He notes that Hitler in 1942 brutally attacked Janning for resisting Nazi measures and that Janning was forced to resign. He argues that judges do not make the laws but are sworn to uphold them. Dr. Wickert describes the special courts led by Hoffstetter and Lammpe that oversaw sterilizations and imposed death penalties on Jews, Poles, and others. Rolfe argues that Germany was not alone in enacting sterilization laws, reading from Oliver Wendell Holmes's decision in Buck v. Bell (1927), upholding a compulsory sterilization law for the mentally deficient. Rudolph Peterson testifies that his parents were communists, and he was sterilized pursuant to an order signed by Hoffstetter. Rolfe introduces evidence that Peterson was sterilized as required by the law due to his inability to pass a basic intelligence test. The judges discuss the Communist take over in Czechoslovakia. Judge Norris notes that the real fight for Germany has begun and the Nuremberg trials have become a political liability. =Act II= Parker introduces a letter from Hoffstetter about making an example of Polish workers who refused to work and another from Lammpe condemning a \\"Jewess\\" who sold her breast milk for consumption by German children. Gueter, the defense attorney in the Feldenstein case, testifies that his client was tried and executed under a \\"racial pollution\\" law prohibiting non-Aryans from having sexual relations with Aryans. Maria Wallner, the Aryan woman with whom Feldenstein was accused of sexual relations, testifies and denies having sexual relations with Feldenstein. Janning was the presiding judge who sentenced Feldenstein to death. Wallner served two years in prison for perjury. Parker introduces orders issued by the defendants by which hundreds were arrested and placed in concentration camps. He then plays a film showing the horrors of the concentration camps. Rolfe expresses outrage at the playing of the film in the trial of defendants who were not aware of these atrocities. Rolfe also offers letters from refugees all over the world attesting that Janning saved them from execution. Mrs. Lindnow testifies for the defense. She was employed by Feldenstein and saw her employer visit Wallner quite often. She also saw Wallner kissing Feldenstein and, on one occasion, sitting on Feldenstein's lap. Wallner is recalled to testify. As Rolfe aggressively cross-examines Wallner, Janning stands, protests his lawyer's conduct, and asks to make a statement. A recess is granted, and Rolfe begs Janning, for the sake of Germany's future, not to make his statement. =Act III= A Senator and General speak outside the courtroom. The General believes the trials are working contrary to America's interests. The Senator tells Judge Haywood that America needs the German people as its friends. Janning testifies. He explains the environment of fear in Germany and how Hitler made the people proud and told them there were devils among them. Janning and others sat silent at the lies because they believed their country was in danger and that the abuses were a passing phase. The passing phase became a way of life. He criticizes his lawyer for defending the actions of his time. He admits that the Feldenstein case was not a trial but a sacrificial ritual and that he reached his verdict before he even entered the courtroom. Rolfe interrupts and objects but Janning continues. Hahn shouts that Janning is a traitor. Rolfe makes his closing argument. He argues that Janning feels guilt, but if Janning is guilty so are others. Hitler's intentions were not secret; they were heard in every part of the world. Hahn is unapologetic and claims that Germany was a bulwark against Bolshevism that the world may yet wish to retain. Haywood announces the decision. He describes Janning as \\"a tragic character\\" who \\"loathed the evil that he did,\\" but asserts that \\"compassion for the present torture of his soul must not beget forgetfulness.\\" All defendants are found guilty, and Janning and Hahn are sentenced to life in prison. After the trial, Haywood is visited by Rolfe who conveys Janning's request to see Haywood and predicts that the men sentenced to life will be released within five years. (Telford Taylor confirms in a final narration that the defendants sentenced to prison had, as Janning predicted, been freed.) Haywood visits Janning in prison. Janning expresses respect for Haywood and the verdict, but he asks for understanding that, with respect to the atrocities, he never knew it would come to that. Haywood insists \\"it came to that\\" the first time Janning sentenced to death a man he knew to be innocent. The play closes with an exchange between Haywood and Byers. As the planes from the Berlin airlift are heard in the background, Byers explains that America is fighting for survival. Haywood replies that, \\"It's not enough to survive,\\" and asserts that if we abandon our basic principles, \\"we become the very thing we are fighting.\\" Cast The cast included performances by:Acting roles are presented in the order in which they appeared in the production's closing credits. * Claude Rains as Judge Haywood (chief judge) * Paul Lukas as Ernst Janning (defendant) * Maximilian Schell as Oscar Rolfe (defense attorney) * Martin Milner as Captain Byers (adjutant) * Melvyn Douglas as General Parker (prosecutor) * Ludwig Donath as Dr. Wickert * Peter Capell as Geuter * Werner Klemperer as Emil Hahn (defendant) * Albert Szabo as Rudolph Peterson * Marketa Kimbrell as Maria Wallner * Torben Meyer as Werner Lammpe (defendant) * Gregory Gay as Friederich Hoffstetter (defendant) * Wendell Holmes as Judge Ives * Alex Gerry as Judge Norris * Oliver McGowan as Senator * Tyler McVey as General * Celia Lovsky as Elsa Lindnow * Mary Adams as Mrs. Haywood * John Bleifer as Mr. Halbestadt * Irene Seidner as Mrs. Halbestadt * John Conwell as Interpreter * Tom Tugend as Interpreter * Steven Chase as Man in Corridor Telford Taylor, former brigadier general and chief counsel for the prosecution at the Nuremberg trials, hosted the broadcast.

In a 1970 poll of television editors, it was named \\"the greatest television series of all time.\\" Abby Mann wrote the teleplay for Playhouse 90. Prior to writing it, Mann met with Telford Taylor who said the Judges' Trial was most significant of the Nuremberg trials. Mann then read the transcript of the Judges' Trial, and it \\"haunted him\\". When he was hired at Playhouse 90, he pitched the idea and traveled to Germany to conduct further research. George Roy Hill was the director and Herbert Brodkin the producer. Telford Taylor was credited as technical consultant. Albert Heschong was the art director and George R. Nelson the set decorator. Dick Joy was the announcer.Production credits are taken from the on-screen credits at the close of the production's kinescope. =Censorship and controversy= Mann recalled that the story's indictment of Germany, a country that was then a key ally in the Cold War, was controversial. George Roy Hill, who had been assigned to direct, proved to be a strong advocate for the project. Prior to the broadcast, one of the sponsors, American Gas, Inc., sent a memorandum demanding that reference to the use of gas to kill Jews be omitted. Hill and the cast refused, and Claude Rains proceeded to refer to the extermination of millions of people in \\"gas ovens.\\" The sponsor had CBS remove the words \\"gas ovens\\" so that no sound was broadcast when Rains spoke the words. The censorship was discovered by the press and resulted in negative publicity for the sponsor, one critic stating, \\"Shame on everybody concerned.\\" Writer Rod Serling in a 1959 interview cited the incident as one of the more indefensible examples of sponsor censorship. Serling noted: \\"It mattered little to these guys that the gas involved in concentration camps was cyanide which bore no resemblance, physical or otherwise, to the gas used in stoves. ... They did not want that awful association made between what was the horror and misery of Nazi Germany with their nice chrome, wonderfully antiseptically clean, beautiful kitchen appliances that they were selling. Now this is an example of sponsor interference which is so beyond logic, and which is so beyond taste, this I rebel against.\\"Rod Serling interview, The Mike Wallace Interview, at 8:00-8:44 (1959). Mann later opined that the controversial subject matter and the censorship controversy were the reasons the production did not receive any Emmy Award nominations. =Adaptations= In 1961, Mann's teleplay was adapted into a film, Judgment at Nuremberg, starring Spencer Tracy and Burt Lancaster.

Completed and commissioned in July 1944, she served in World War II, conducting four war patrols, including operations off the Philippine Islands and the Ryukyu Islands. The only Kaichu-type submarine to survive the war, she surrendered in 1945 after its conclusion and was scuttled in 1946. Design and description The submarines of the K6 sub-class were versions of the preceding K5 sub-class with greater range and diving depth. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of .Bagnasco, p. 187 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor.Chesneau, p. 203 They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the K6s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with four internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of ten torpedoes. They were also armed with a single L/40 anti-aircraft gun and two single AA guns.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 124 Construction and commissioning Ro-50 was laid down at Submarine No. 391 on 18 February 1943 by Mitsui Zosensho at Tamano, Japan. She was launched on 31 July 1943 and was renamed Ro-50 that day. She was completed and commissioned on 31 July 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-50 was attached to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. She was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet on 5 November 1944. =First war patrol= On 19 November 1944, Ro-50 departed Kure, Japan, to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Philippine Sea east of Luzon in the Philippine Islands. While she was en route, an Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service floatplane mistakenly attacked her, dropping two depth charges, but she dived to and emerged unscathed from the encounter. Ro-50 was in the Philippine Sea northeast of Luzon‚Ä≤s Lamon Bay on 25 November 1944 when she detected a plane on radar. Believing the plane to have come from a United States Navy aircraft carrier, Ro-50‚Ä≤s commanding officer moved to intercept the carrier. Five hours later, Ro-50 detected propeller noises, and soon thereafter she sighted three aircraft carriers with eight destroyers escorting them in a ring formation. After Ro-50 penetrated the escort screen, she sighted what her commanding officer described as a \\"Wasp-class\\" aircraft carrier dead ahead at a range of only . After she fired four torpedoes at the carrier and dived to , her crew heard a large explosion, and five minutes later her sound operator reported hearing the noises of a sinking ship breaking up that lasted for the next two minutes. Ro-50‚Ä≤s commanding officer claimed to have sunk an escort aircraft carrier and a destroyer in the attack, but postwar analysis disproved his claim, and the explosion and other sounds Ro-50‚Ä≤s crew heard probably were due to premature or end-of-run detonations of her torpedoes. Her target may have been U.S. Navy Task Group 38.3, a component of Task Force 38, because the battleship , operating as a part of that task group, sighted two torpedoes passing ahead of her at the time of Ro-50‚Ä≤s attack, at least one of which appeared to be suffering from a steering problem. Ro-50 returned to Kure on 27 December 1944. =Second war patrol= With 6th Fleet commander-in-chief Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Miwa on hand to see her off, Ro-50 set out from Kure on 23 January 1945 to begin her second war patrol, again in the Philippine Sea east of Luzon. She was off Leyte on 1 February 1945 when she sighted an Allied ship and pursued it, but she discontinued the chase when she identified it as a hospital ship. On 3 February 1945, she was in the Philippine Sea east of Luzon when an Allied warship ‚Äî possibly the U.S. destroyer escort , which reported making a depth-charge attack against a sonar contact that day while on the return leg to Manus Island of a round-trip voyage as a convoy escort ‚Äî pursued and attacked her. She escaped, but suffered damage. On 4 February 1945, Ro-50 received orders from the 6th Fleet to stand by to evacuate Imperial Japanese Navy pilots stranded in the Batulinao area of northern Luzon. On 10 February 1945, however, she encountered an Allied convoy steaming in a single column at east-southeast of Surigao on Leyte. She fired four torpedoes, one of which struck the tank landing ship , which was on a voyage from Hollandia, New Guinea, to Leyte, at about 08:10. The torpedo exploded, blowing off about a third of LST-577, including her bridge. Steaming a few thousand yards to port of LST-577, the destroyer began a search for Ro-50 while another tank landing ship prepared to take LST-577 under tow and the rest of the convoy and its escorts departed the area. Ro-50 surfaced after sundown on 10 February, and at 21:10 Isherwood detected her on radar at a range of . Working up to , Isherwood closed to and turned on her searchlights, but none could bear on Ro-50. Seeing the searchlights, Ro-50 crash-dived, descending to . Isherwood then made sound contact on Ro-50 and dropped a full pattern of depth charges at a shallow setting. The explosion of the depth charges damaged Ro-50, rupturing her diving tank valve, shattering the lenses in both of her periscopes, and causing leaks in all of her torpedo tubes. Isherwood dropped two more full patterns of depth charges before losing contact, and her commanding officer and other members of her crew reported smelling oil. Ro-50 survived the attacks and escaped. When she surfaced, her crew discovered a fragment of a depth-charge on her afterdeck, and her commanding officer reported sinking an American cargo ship. Ro-50 had, in fact, inflicted fatal damage on LST-577, which Isherwood scuttled east of Mindanao at on 11 February 1945. On 14 February 1945, Ro-50 transmitted a situation report to 6th Fleet headquarters and received permission to return to Kure, with orders to conduct a reconnaissance of the Ryukyu Islands en route. An Imperial Japanese Navy floatplane mistakenly attacked her south of Kyushu on 19 February 1945, dropping three depth charges, but she reached Kure on 20 February. She later moved to Maizuru. =Third war patrol= On 20 April 1945, Ro-50 got underway from Maizuru and transited the Bungo Strait to begin her third war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Philippine Sea off Kitadait≈çjima at the northern end of the Dait≈ç Islands southeast of Okinawa. Off Kitadait≈çjima on 28 April, she detected the propeller noises of an Allied task force, but was too far away to attempt an attack. She returned to Kure on 4 May 1945, and later moved back to Maizuru. =Fourth war patrol= Ro-50 departed Maizuru on 29 May 1945, heading for an area in the East China Sea east of Formosa for her fourth war patrol. After she arrived in her patrol area on 6 June 1945, she received orders to move to the waters of the Philippine Sea between Okinawa and Ulithi Atoll. Her patrol was uneventful, and she returned to Maizuru on 3 July 1945. =End of war= Ro-50 was still in Japan when Emperor Hirohito announced the end of hostilities between Japan and the Allies on 15 August 1945. She was transferred from Submarine Division 34 to Submarine Division 15 that day. The only Kaichu-type submarine to survive World War II,combinedfleet.com Kaichu Type she surrendered to the Allies in September 1945. Final disposition The Japanese struck Ro-50 from the Navy list on 30 November 1945. After she was stripped of all useful equipment and material, the U.S. Navy scuttled her along with a number of other Japanese submarines off the Goto Islands on 1 April 1946 in Operation Road's End, sinking her due east of Goto Island, off Kinai Island.

She is merely 10 years old and loses her way back. There she meets a mysterious young boy, who she takes to be a changeling and who guides her back to her manor, disappearing without giving his introduction. Six years later in 1903, James Herondale and his friends, his parabatai Matthew Fairchild - son of the Consul Charlotte Fairchild, Thomas Lightwood, (son of Gideon Lightwood and Sophie Collins) and Christopher Lightwood (son of Gabriel Lightwood and Cecily Herondale), chance upon a Deumas demon while patrolling. This strikes them as odd, for Deumas were rarely encountered. James Herondale goes into the shadow realm for the first time in 3 years, and the demon recognizes him. Demonic activities had been scarce in London as the next generation of Herondales, Fairchilds and Lightwoods had grown up. The next morning, Cordelia Carstairs enters the London society, along with her brother Alastair Carstairs and mother Sona Carstairs. Her father has been arrested for a vampire raid gone rogue, and the Carstairs wish to make powerful allies in London to save their reputation. She is greeted by Tessa, James and Lucie Herondale, who she is set to be parabatai with. Whilst roaming in the park, Lucie tells Cordelia that James is in love - subtly hinting that the object of his affection might be Cordelia herself. Cordelia is stunned, for she never expected him to return the love she felt for him since childhood. The next evening a ball is held by the Herondales at the Institute, welcoming the Carstairs family to the society. Whilst there, James leaves Cordelia stranded on the dance floor when he goes on to greet the mysterious new arrival, Grace Blackthorn, the adopted ward of Tatiana Blackthorn. Luckily Matthew intervenes, saving Cordelia's reputation. James had met Grace in 1999 when Tatiana hired him to cut the briars of her house during his summer vacation in Idris. While dancing, it was revealed that James has been in love with Grace since he was 13 years old. Lucie once again sees the \\"changeling boy\\" who reveals himself to be the ghost of Jesse Blackthorn, the late son of Tatiana. His mother asked Downworlders to preserve his body, so his spirit has remained trapped in the in-between. His mother and Grace can also see him, and he assumed Lucie could only see him as a child. He‚Äôs surprised she can still see him six years later. James is suddenly swept into the Shadow Realm again and there he sees Barbara Lightwood, Thomas's oldest sister, being attacked. Seconds later, Barabara collapses in the ballroom but is saved by Cordelia and Anna Lightwood, Christopher's sister, and she shrugs it off as exhaustion. A grave news arrives as there is a demon attack in Seven Dials. It is revealed that in his childhood, James visited Cirenworth Hall a few years ago and contracted scalding fever. Cordelia had tended to him then and read him her favorite book Layla and Majnun. When he had slipped into the realm again, instead of running away, she had curled up in the bed beside him and let him use her as an anchor to stay tied to their world. The children had parted on proper terms, never once mentioning the incident again. The next morning the youngsters go for a picnic to Regent's Park where Cordelia gets acquainted with Anna Lightwood, Thomas Lightwood and Christopher Lightwood. Anna invites Cordelia to her flat. At James' arrival, she takes him aside and makes him apologize to her for leaving her in the middle of the dance the previous night. James reveals his relationship with Grace to Cordelia who is heartbroken but happy for him. Later Grace comes over to him and they kiss before being attacked by demons, in broad daylight. The demons strike and wound three shadowhunters- Piers Wentsworth, Barbara, and Ariadne Bridgestock. Everybody is immediately rushed to the institute, where Brother Zachariah tends to the wounded along with several other Silent Brothers. Jem singularly seeks out James who relegates his experience of going into the shadow realm before the attacks. In order to be useful, James attempts to disappear into the shadow realm at will, as he had done once before. He succeeds when Matthew sends him into shock by insulting him. In a flashback it is shown that after his illness in Cirenworth Hall, James meets Grace once again, as he had been for preceding years. There he rambles on about Cordelia and that's when Grace points out that he was in love with Cordelia which he half-heartedly denied. Later on, though Grace requested him to use his shadow abilities and retrieve her familial bracelet which was seized by Tatiana and had the Cartwright family symbol on it. The Clave is intimated of the demon inside the greenhouse and Charles reprimands James and tells him to stay away from the Blackthorns for a while. He is disgruntled and calls upon the Fairchilds where he gives some dust he had collected from the alternate dimension to Henry Branwell to assess and draw conclusion. He is joined shortly by Christopher and Thomas and they talk when a missive addressed to Matthew arrives, signed by Grace. James reads it and leaves the house instantly, not informing his friends that the note stated that Grace was in danger. Alastair meanwhile, drops Cordelia to Anna Lightwood's place at her independent apartment in Percy Street. Cordelia notices Anna's heartless nature for the first time when Anna chucks away a mundane woman, who she seemingly had a fling with. However Cordelia admires Anna and strikes a conversation, where she informs Anna that she wishes to be a hero. They are interrupted by Matthew who takes them to meet Malcolm Fade. Jesse visits Lucie in her bedroom and informs her that James' life is in danger, as Grace was being followed by the Blackthorn family demon and would probably murder anyone who wasn't a Blackthorn. She gathers her weapons and goes to save James. Cordelia, Matthew and Anna visit Malcolm and Hypatia Vex, where they inquire about the attacks and if the downworlders might have heard of it. Cordelia saves the warlocks' lives when she captures the waitress, Arabella poisoning the drink. In return they help her by sending for Ragnor Fell who might be able to help them. In a flashback, In 1902, Thomas Lightwood had been gone for his travel year and stopped at Paris, He had met Alastair Carstairs there, and they had toured the whole city amiably. Around that time, Thomas had felt himself warming up to Alastair. Back in the night, James meets up with Grace as per her instructions and she asks James to forsake his Shadowhunter blood, run away, and marry her. It‚Äôs the only way she can escape her cruel mother. James silently considers it but decides there‚Äôs no way he can forsake his family, friends, or parabatai. Grace is angry at his declaration, but she‚Äôs cut short when demons attack them. Lucie, Christopher, Matthew, Thomas, Cordelia and Alastair come to their aid. The strongest demon recognizes James and asks why James is fighting against the creatures who worship his own grandfather. The demon calls Tessa‚Äôs demon father a prince of hell, which is a fallen angel as powerful as Raziel. James is shocked at the revelation. He lets the remaining demons go in the name of his grandfather as long as they go back to their own dimension. They will do so as long as no one present tells any other Shadowhunters about what transpired at the waterfront. After they‚Äôre gone, Tatiana pulls up in her carriage searching for Grace. James begs Grace to come to the Institute with him. His father will grant her safe haven. Tatiana promises to produce evidence that Grace practices black magic and conjures demons‚Äîclaims that would ruin her life and reputation‚Äîif she doesn‚Äôt come home with her. In the London Institute, Ragnor visits the teenagers-sans Cordelia and Alastair, and gives them a lead - Emmanuel Gast, who he thought might be able to dredge up information. A shocking news arrives when Barbara Lightwood is pronounced dead. At the Carstairs manor in Cornwall Gardens, Charles visits late at night. Cordelia, afraid that her brother might tell him of James' grandfather, eavesdrops on her brother and Charles' conversation and finds out that Alistair and Charles are gay and Charles was marrying Ariadne for power only. He was scared of rejection by the society and hence couldn't publicly display his sexual orientation unlike Anna. The next morning, James visits Cordelia and they, along with Matthew and Lucie pay a visit to Emmanuel Gast. However to their dismay he is already dead and Lucie gets locked in a room where she summons Emmanuel's ghost and finds out that he had raised the demon who was wreaking havoc over London. He even claimed that he knew her grandfather but she banished him before he could reveal much. Later they find splinters of wood with strange inscriptions. The four head back to the institute and lie to Will and Tessa about where they‚Äôve been. They question Jessamine about whether ghosts can lie to see if Gast‚Äôs claims were true. They hear a ruckus outside. Charles has arrived in a carriage, bringing Grace and a bloodied Tatiana to the Institute. Once Tatiana is being treated by the Silent Brothers in the infirmary, Grace pulls James aside to talk to him. James takes Grace aside where she informs him that she is now engaged to Charles - who had broken off his engagement with Ariadne whilst she was unconscious. Grace demands her bracelet back from him and when he does return it back, he feels physical pain from the separation. He goes to the Blackfriars Bridge to relieve his heartache. Grace finds Matthew and tells him what has transpired. Before she leaves, she seemingly holds Matthew in place with words alone and kisses him. She threatens to tell James about this kiss if Matthew ever breathes a word of their conversation to anyone. Matthew later finds James sitting on the bridge and in a moment of recklessness James drinks from his flask, and loses consciousness due to exhaustion. The next morning when he wakes up, he finds the hurt gone, and feels oddly light. Cordelia meanwhile had accompanied Anna to the infirmary and seen her put her guard down and sob for Ariadne. Will and Tessa have gone with the Silent Brothers to transport Tatiana and the other remaining wounded Shadowhunters to the Silent City. Grace will be staying with the Bridgestocks near the City to be close to her mother. Cordelia receives a letter from Charlotte, answering her inquiries about her father. He‚Äôs actually already been questioned with the Mortal Sword, which Cordelia was sure would clear his name as it requires the holder to speak only truth. Unfortunately, the demon attack has been erased from his memory, so he cannot clear his name with the sword. Christopher arrives with the results and the group discovers that the shards of wood were pieces of a Pyxis. James informs them that the inscription were written in Old Persian and they realize that the demon was in fact a Mandikhor demon, which can produce smaller demons known as Khora demons. They form a plan to capture the demon but for that they would need a Pyxis. Cordelia recalls seeing one at Hypatia's salon and they decide to approach Anna for aid. James escorts Cordelia home and Sona presumes that they both were getting closer than before and James had marital intentions, to which Cordelia replies in the negative. Cordelia goes to Alastair to gently break the news of Charles‚Äô new engagement to him. Alastair already knew and is not happy when Cordelia tells him she eavesdropped on his recent conversation with Charles. The next evening, James, Cordelia and Matthew accompany Anna to Hell Ruelle, where Hypatia is hosting a party. Anna has Cordelia wear a beautiful dress and James is stunned by her appearance. Lucie, Christopher and Thomas spy on the Enclave meeting and find out that Oliver, Barbara's ex-fiancee had passed away as well, seemingly due to the fact that Barbara had scratched him before her death. This shocked the entire Enclave as demon poison had never been contagious before, and London is placed immediately under quarantine. In Hell Ruelle, Anna seduces Hypatia and Cordelia performs in front of the gathering. James and Matthew are impressed, however they notice Charles entering the club. Matthew pushes the couple away and they hide in The Whispering Room, where James and Cordelia share a passionate kiss. The next morning the Merry Thieves, Lucie, and Cordelia take advantage of the fact that Will and Tessa are gone for day-patrols--an added precaution by the Clave, and empty the Pyxis by letting out a Palpis demon named Agliarept, so that they may use it to trap the Mandikhor. They kill the demon before he could sway them. Since they performed it in the Sanctuary, Magnus walks in on them inquiring about their actions. They explain to him, their plans of ridding the shadow world of the demon and Cordelia implores Magnus to help them out by casting an illusion over Tower Bridge, to protect and distract the mundanes. Magnus agrees. While they are going towards Tower Bridge, Magnus disproves James' theory of his grandfather being Belphegor. In 1900, Cirenworth Hall there was an argument between the Carstairs siblings regarding the possession of Cortana. Cordelia stated that she wanted to be a merciful hero and Alastair merely said that the sword belonged to him as he was the Carstairs heir. However, Cortana flew back into Cordelia's hand, \\"choosing its owner.\\" The group goes to Tower Bridge to try to fight and capture the demon, but it breaks free of the Pyxis. During their fight against the Mandikhor, Cordelia is knocked into the Thames, but Lucie summons all the ghosts of London to her aid and they pull Cordelia out of the waters. When the demon departs, it speaks to James and tries to convince him to go to Belial's realm. Christopher is able to figure out the cure but couldn't find a way to make it work without a key illegal ingredient. James is able to locate where it may be found but before they could retrieve it, Christopher is attacked and poisoned himself. Cordelia's mother reveals that she's pregnant. While receiving treatment in the Silent City, James, Cordelia, and Matthew sneak in and talked with Christopher. Christopher, under the influence of the infection, grabs James's wrist, infecting him, while trying to warn him that he was in danger and all the attacks were about him. Meanwhile, Thomas searches the Chiswick grounds for the malos root and Lucie wanders off to a shed, where she spies on Grace Blackthorn. She notices Jesse Blackthorn's body, in a glass coffin, where he appears to be asleep. She hears Grace talking about her mother hurting James when suddenly a Namtar demon attacks her. It scoffs at her for removing James' bracelet and reaches out to destroy Jesse's coffin when Lucie reveals herself and helps Grace against the attack. Just as they are cornered and about to be injured, Jesse kills it with a sword. Lucie utters his name, astonishing Grace and befuddling her as to how Lucie could see Jesse. Lucie and Thomas Lightwood are able to retrieve the plant to finish the antidote for the poison Christopher had developed. Thomas and Alastair use Henry's lab to create the elixir and go to the Silent City to distribute it, which is a huge success. After fleeing the City, James realizes that the person behind the attacks had to be his demonic grandfather. He enters the shadow realm to confront and stop Belial once and for all. After some time, Cordelia uses Cortana to cut through the Portal to help him. Belial reveals that the Mandikhor demon was raised partially in the physical world and partially in his realm, making it immune to sunlight. They battle the Mandikhor, but are gravely outmatched until James used his connection to Belial's realm to summon a tornado and kill it. Belial then approaches James to proposition him once again, to which Cordelia ran him through with Cortana. With Belial being severely wounded, the realm collapses, and James and Cordelia return to their own realm. Having been poisoned and depleted his strength when reaching into the realm, James is dying when they came back. Matthew tries iratzes but they are not strong enough to save him. Thankfully, unbeknownst to him, the ghost of Jesse Blackthorn gave James his last breath ‚Äî which had been preserved in his locket to one day resurrect himself‚Äîsaving his life. Days later, while still recovering from his ordeal, James is visited by Grace. Grace pleads for his understanding of her actions and then tells him of her mother's involvement in necromancy and her plans against Nephilim. She forces her bracelet back on his wrist and asks that he go to Blackthorn Manor to destroy an automaton there. With the bracelet's control strengthened, James agrees and in the process of destroying it, burns down the manor. At the following council meeting, Tatiana accuses James of having orchestrated the Mandikhor attacks and then burning her house down to destroy her evidence. In an effort to protect him, Cordelia provides him with an alibi, claiming he had been with her the night before, tarnishing her reputation. While Tatiana is being arrested and sent to the Adamant Citadel for the dark magic items found in the rubble of her home, James proposes to Cordelia in order to save her reputation, with the plan to divorce in a year, and Cordelia agrees. At James and Cordelia's engagement party, Matthew drinks heavily in an attempt to drown his sorrows, realizing he is in love with Cordelia. Charles announces his engagement to Grace and later seeks out Alastair, who breaks up with him in a lone corridor with Cordelia there to support him. Because of his drunken state, Matthew reveals the rumors Alastair had spread about their parents to Thomas, in an effort to prevent their friendship, causing Thomas to threaten Alastair, who runs out of the room crying. Ariadne approaches Anna, telling her that she heard her when she spoke to her at the infirmary, making Ariadne realize that Anna still loved her. When Anna asserts her reputation of being a pessimist about love, Ariadne tells her that she will win her back. Grace emerges from the shadows and she and Lucie talk about resurrecting Jesse. Magnus Bane finds Matthew feeling desolate, as he notices the younger boy looking towards James and Cordelia dancing merrily. It is then that he reveals his attraction towards Cordelia and hints about the false marriage. Magnus is intrigued and decides that he needed to stay in London for a little while longer. Cordelia reflects on how drastically her life had changed since her arrival in London. James talks to her and tells her that he wishes she could be happy. He also states that the events of the whispering room had been a pretense. Cordelia is saddened but resolves to spend this one year with James happily. Meanwhile, in Chiswick manor, Tatiana, who is now being banished to the Adamant Citadel, visits her son's coffin. She finds Belial waiting for her, and he says that he will rise much earlier than the Nephilim assumed. He also states that since Tatiana was now in the Adamant Citadel, they will strike at the heart of the shadowhunters-their Adamas. Saying this he vanishes again, leaving Tatiana satisfied.

She was designed and built by the British shipbuilder Yarrows from 1894‚Äì1895 and was claimed to be the fastest warship in the world during her sea trials. She was renamed Pruitki (Russian: –ü—Ä—ã—Ç–∫–∏–π - Nimble) in 1902. The destroyer served as part of the Russian Baltic Fleet, taking part in the First World War and joined the Bolshevik Red Fleet following the October Revolution. She was active during the Russian Civil War and was scrapped in 1922. Design and construction The Imperial Russian Navy was the second navy, after the British Royal Navy, to order destroyers, placing an order with the British shipbuilder Yarrow & Company, a specialist in torpedo craft, which had built five of the Royal Navy's first destroyers (the and classes). Yarrow's design was similar to its designs for the Royal Navy, but the ship's hull made widespread use of Nickel steel, with aluminium being used for some fittings to reduce weight. left The ship was long overall, with a beam of and a mean draught of . Displacement was . The ship was powered by two triple expansion steam engines, fed by eight Yarrow water-tube boilers with steam at and drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , to give a speed of . Armament was a single 75 mm gun, mounted on the roof of the ship's conning tower, together with three 47 mm guns, while two torpedo tubes were fitted on the centreline aft, with up to six torpedoes carried. Ten mines could be carried. The ship had a crew of 54 officers and men. Sokol was laid down in November 1894, and was launched at Yarrow's Poplar, London shipyard on 22 August 1895 (10 August 1895, Old Style), with all machinery already fitted. This allowed the ship to commence preliminary Sea trials the next day, reaching a speed of , with the speed reaching during official trials. These speeds resulted in Sokol being claimed to be the fastest warship in the world. Thirty-one more destroyers of similar design (Twenty-six more Sokols, also known as the Puilki-class and five Tverdi-class destroyers, differing only in mounting larger torpedoes) were built in Russian yards from 1896 to 1908, although they did not manage to match the performance of Sokol. Service Sokol commissioned in October 1895 and arrived at the Russian port of Kronstadt later that month, joining the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Sokol was renamed Pruitki on 22 March 1902 (9 March 1902 Old Style). She underwent a major refit from 1909 to 1910, where she was rearmed as a result of experience from the Russo-Japanese War, with a second 75 mm gun replacing the three 47 mm guns, and the torpedo tubes being replaced by 457 mm (18 in) tubes. Pruitki was obsolete and unsuitable for front line combat use by the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, and in 1915 was fitted for minesweeping. She was employed for minesweeping, patrol, escort duties and as a despatch vessel in the Gulf of Finland and Gulf of Bothnia during the war, joining the 2nd Minesweeping division in January 1916. Pruitki sided with the Bolsheviks following the October Revolution, joining the Red Fleet. In March 1918, Germany intervened in the Finnish Civil War, landing a division of troops (the Baltic Sea Division) to reinforce the Finnish White forces. The advance of the Germans and White Finns soon threatened the port of Helsingfors (now Helsinki), where the Baltic Fleet was based. On 10 April 1918, the Bolsheviks managed to evacuate most of the Baltic Fleet, including Pruitki, which had been supporting the Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic (the \\"Red\\" or Socialist Finns), despite much of the Baltic still being ice-bound. Pruitki arrived at Kronstadt on 19 April, taking ten days for a journey that would normally take half a day owing to the difficulty in navigating the ice in such small ships. In August 1918, as the Russian Civil War progressed, Pruitki, together with her remaining sister ships in the Baltic Fleet, was transferred from Petrograd to the River Volga via the Mariinsk Canal System, reaching Nizhny Novgorod on 24 August. From August to October 1918, Pruitki took part in fighting against White Army forces near Kazan and on the River Kama, later moving to the lower reaches of the Volga and operating in the Northern parts of the Caspian Sea in 1919 to 1920. She was stricken on 16 August 1922 and handed over for scrapping.

Sheila Fitzpatrick is the Bernadotte E. Schmitt Distinguished Service Professor (Emeritus), Department of History, University of Chicago. Synopsis Everyday Stalinism looks at the impact of urbanization and industrialization in the Soviet Union in the 1930s under Joseph Stalin. Focused on a history from below, Fitzpatrick records a history of impoverishment, overcrowding, and social destruction visited upon the average person. It records how ordinary citizens attempted to adapt when possible and circumvent when necessary the new way of life forced upon them by an omnipresent state bureaucracy backed up by a ruthless and brutal state secret police and the waves of terror and turmoil it imposed on Soviet society. Fitzpatrick's 1994 work Stalin's Peasants looked at rural life in the Soviet Union in the 1930s during the period of Stalinist colectivization and the impact it had on the daily life of peasants. Everyday Stalinism completes the story by providing a look at urban life in the Soviet Union during the 1930s and the impact industrialization had on workers and their families and the shockwaves in urban centers created by the massive disruption collectivization caused in Soviet agriculture. Together the works form the story of the two sides of the devastating consequences of Stalinism had on the Soviet Union. Lewis H. Siegelbaum (Michigan State University) writes in Slavic Review, > Her range of sources is enormous. It includes, inter alia, advertisements, > standard personnel questionnaires, movie scenes, and song lyrics. From these > as well as diaries, memoirs, letters, newspaper articles, and travelers' > accounts, she extracts telling details about the symbolic significance of > uniforms and domestically produced champagne, markers of privilege such as > chauffeur driven cars, dachas, and travel allowances, and the crucial role > that patronage played in acquiring them. The types of individuals we meet > along the way include not only the party elite, pampered Stakhanovites and > intellectuals, but also conmen and domestic servants. Fitzpatrick covers a broad range of topics to provide the reader with an understanding of how Stalinism impacted the lives of a wide variety of individuals in the Soviet Union. These include: the inner workings of the Communist party and the expectations placed on members; a contrast of the relative comfort in the lives of party members compared with the poverty and constant depravations the average Soviet citizen faced; the omnipresent state propaganda of building a \\"radiant future\\"; the psychological impact of Stalinism on priviledged insiders, the average individual, and those the party labeled as outsiders and enemies; the system of popular surveillance and denunciation, created and encouraged by the party to enforce communist ideology and practice; the experience of living through or dying in on of the greatest periods of oppression and mass murder in history. Some topics are covered lightly or excluded from Fitzpatrick's coverage of everyday life; the areas of work and occupations, education, and those of friendship and romance are examples. Regarding work and everyday life, Fitzpatrick states, \\"I am interested in the experiences and practices that were common to the urban population as a whole, not just parts of it. This is why work, a part of everyday life that varies greatly from one occupational group to another, is not a central topic in this study.\\" The contrast between the propaganda of abundance and the reality of want form the key theme of the first part of the book. From the start, building socialism in the Soviet Union theoretically meant creating a new classless egalitarian society that was able to produce an abundance of consumer goods as well as support robust industrial production. In reality, it produced a different, but even more rigid hierarchical society which was eventually even less able to support its citizens with consumer goods than what it replaced. The new hierarchy became the new class system and an individual's position within it and their relations to others determined their access to goods. Far from being a production-oriented society, the Stalinist Soviet Union became a prime example of a society forced to focus primarily on obtaining the necessities of life. Fitzpatrick documents the fantasy of the urban Potemkin village that the Soviet government attempted to portray, with the reality of rationing, rampant speculation, shops closed due to the lack of goods, and lengthy queues at those that were open, all of which formed the struggle average citizens faced trying to obtain the essentials of daily life. The strategies people used to survive and the system of blat, essentially the ability to access black markets and the underground economy, are shown to be the alternatives forced upon people to survive. This is all contrasted with the favoritism and relative abundance available to the Soviet elite and those they favored, completing a picture of the different castes within the supposedly classless society. Writing in Social History, Sarah Davies states, > She shows how the chronic housing shortages of the 1930s gave rise to a > number of practices, including fictive marriages, renting out corners of > rooms, and continuing to live with spouses after a divorce. Because of the > shortages of goods, both official and unofficial rationing were a constant > feature of the decade. Speculation emerged as a way of coping with the > inefficiencies of the official distribution system. The 'second economy' was > a vital element of Stalinism. Blat (the use of contacts to exchange goods > and services) was cultivated, and 'friends' became very important for > survival. This was summed up pithily in a contemporary saying: 'One must > have not I00 roubles, but a hundred friends.' ... In this society status > mattered more than money. Like blat, patronage was ubiquitous, as people > lower down the hierarchy relied on the support and protection of those > higher up in order to obtain goods in short supply and to secure privileges. Having set the stage and introduced the life of the average urban dweller, Fitzpatrick introduces more elements of urban life in the following chapters. Chapters include \\"Insulted and Injured\\" which deals with those individuals who were outcasts from Stalinist society and \\"Family Problems\\" where the author discusses how Soviet families were impacted by the economic upheaval, goods shortages, and the general social disruption that accompanied forced industrialization and urbanization. Finally the book concludes with chapters related to the Great Purges that occurred during 1937-38, the rise of surveillance by coworkers, friends, family, and the public at large, \\"denouncers\\" and \\"scapegoating\\" and the terror and uncertainty, not unlike the dekulakisation which occurred earlier in the countryside, that entered the lives of urban dwellers. Reception Oksana Fedotova writes in Russian History, \\"This new book by Sheila Fitzpatrick is an outstanding contribution to the existing body of research into the Soviet past. Extensive use of archival material, combined with a wide range of published sources, and highlighted by references to the contemporary press cuttings, reveal an absorbing picture of everyday life under Stalinism. Against a rich variety of locations that stretched from workers' barracks and communal kitchens to the apartments of senior officials and closed access stores, there unfolds before our eyes an impressive array of characters. Bosses and outcasts, patrons and clients, activists and absconding husbands, elite wives and homeless children, are depicted in a multitude of activities and relationships that characterized the turbulent life of 1930s Russia.\\" Writing in the Journal of Modern History, Jeffrey J. Rossman writes, \\"Meticulously researched, imaginatively organized, and fluidly written, it deserves a wide audience.\\"'' Geoffrey Hosking writes in the The Slavonic and East European Review, \\" Anyone coming to this book from histories of everyday life as we are accustomed to them is in for a surprise. Far from being rigorously excluded, politics is in the driving seat. The first chapter concerns the authorities, in the form of the Soviet state and the Communist Party.

The album was recorded and released a year after his debut album To Be One with You. As on his debut album, Klinghoffer has the participation of guest artists: Jack Irons, who appears on drums for \\"Red Don‚Äôt Feel\\", \\"The Night Won‚Äôt Scare Me\\", \\"Carry\\" and \\"Plank\\"; Redd Kross and Off! bassist Steven Shane McDonald, featured on the song \\"Mother Nature\\"; Billy Mohler performs double bass on the song \\"I Hear You\\". \\"The Night Won‚Äôt Scare Me\\" was released as the first single on the ORG Music label Soundcloud profile through a Rolling Stone article. The album will be released on vinyl (also a limited colored edition of a gold vinyl), CD and digitally.  Background  Along with the release of \\"The Night Won't Scare Me\\", an interview with Klinghoffer was published in Rolling Stone magazine in which he mentioned that he began work on the album in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak in United States. Klinghoffer mentions that during this time, unlike his debut album, he was able to fully concentrate on writing and recording an album in the same period of time. Klinghoffer released a statement about the album's release saying: \\"Do you feel well? How does it feel to hear that, to ask yourself that? Well, it's felt weird to me for a long time. If I hear about your feelings, or am asked about mine, I barely know what you're talking about. I don't feel well. This is a wild time. This album was made during and amongst some very new experiences. I hope it captures some of how it felt during this period. I'll feel better when this is behind\\". The day of the album's release, Klinghoffer commented on it via Twitter and Instagram: \\"Funny that 2020 is what‚Äôs considered ‚Äònormal‚Äô when discussing visual acuity. This year, these days, right now, is anything but normal. I guess we can get into what ‚Äònormal‚Äô really is another time. Right now, I know many people are hurting, suffering, feeling anxious or just frighteningly unsure of the future. There is a hell of a lot of noise out there so I apologize for adding to the pile of it, but, my hope is (if you‚Äôre here and reading this you‚Äôre inclined to listen to the noise that I make) it makes you feel a little bit calmer, a little bit safer, and a little bit more at peace‚Ä¶ if only for a minute. I truly think we‚Äôll be okay. We just have to work together. Again, many many many thanks to everyone for all the love and support. Here‚Äôs to feeling!!!\\".  Music  About the first single of the album \\"The Night Won't Scare Me\\", Klinghoffer told Rolling Stone that the song began with a chord progression that he originally composed for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but the track was completed \\"in a burst of creativity\\" after his departure. \\"The Report\\" was released as the second single, about the song Klinghoffer said that was written the day that William Barr made his \\"obfuscation performance\\" about the Mueller Report. \\"I think I was sitting in bed, watching that scumbag blather, and playing chords that sounded like the image of spiders crawling out of his eyes. That wretched man. That‚Äôs where the music was born\\" is what Klinghoffer told to SPIN magazine. The song changed and finally ended up being a report regarding his state of mind in the present year, for a time was named after the album title.

History In 2012, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Ministry of Culture to work out and implement a tourist project that would unite the cultural and historical centers of North-West Russia. According to the idea, the project was supposed to contribute to the development of the region by attracting investments. In February 2015, the Vologda Oblast hosted an All-Russian conference on the creation of a new historical, cultural and tourist project. The conference was convened at the initiative of the Russian Ministry of Culture.

Her first US solo show was The Great Penetrator (2013), featuring portraits of hoofed animals from a Berlin zoo juxtaposed with images of a street corner and a naked hips and vagina. Her 2016 series #lonelygirl parodied the trend of posting sexualized selfies online through a series of allegorical monkey selfies where a monkey named Jeany is a stand-in for the artist. A photograph of the monkey nibbling on a dildo was featured on the cover of the May 2016 issue of Artforum. Her 2016 series Baby captures images of the heads of babies emerging from the birth canal.

He spent $30,000 for nothing.‚Äù Shin submitted her West portraits to the 2019 Whitney Bienneal, but met with resistance from curators who said they feared that West's celebrity and notoriety would dominate the show. At the time he was widely criticized for his support of Donald Trump and comments about slavery. Two West portraits were eventually accepted when Shin agreed to display five photos from the Baby series, but during the biennial, the curators placed West's large portraits in the basement between the restrooms and coat check. Shin said ‚ÄúI thought it was funny because everybody would see it and also wonder why, and then it‚Äôs like the basement is the area for repressed content.‚Äù Her most recent work is a series of portraits of roosters called Big Cocks. Shin said \\"they‚Äôre extremely, extremely beautiful [...] the short-lived outbursts of angry cock energy look Hellenistic and virile.\\" Though her work is provocative and boundary-crossing, she said ‚ÄúDoing something simply out of a desire to be transgressive is very stupid, you know, just to break certain taboos. It has to have more substance than that, I think.‚Äù Shin is married to the Canadian artist Mathieu Malouf.

The building at the current location on the Henri Dunantlaan was opened in 2011.  History  = Created by mergers = The Jeroen Bosch Hospital resulted from multiple mergers. First a merger between the originally Protestant Willem-Alexander Hospital and the originally Roman Catholic Groot Ziekengasthuis created the Bosch Medicentrum. Next Bosch Medicentrum merged with the Carolus-Liduina general hospital. The new hospital was named after the most famous citizen of 's-Hertogenbosch, Hieronymus Bosch. = Current building = At the location of the Willem Alexander hospital construction of a new hospital started in November 2007. It had to be large enough to replace the three former locations in 's-Hertogenbosch. The former Willem-Alexander Hospital was integrated in the new building, and is now used primarily for offices and laboratories. The new building was delivered in December 2010. The hospitals moved in in April and May 2011. The official opening of the new hospital was done by Crown Prince Willem-Alexander on 24 June 2011. = Covid-19 / Coronavirus= In the Netherlands the early 2020 outbreak of the coronavirus was especially intense in North Brabant. Many inhabitants had been infected on vacation in Austria and Northern Italy. Next they had spread the virus further during Carnival, which is a feast typical for North Brabant and Limburg. It resulted in a high reproduction rate for the virus in North Brabant, and the Jeroen Bosch Hospital becoming especially busy at the time. The hospital even created a temporary extra helipad to transport patients to other hospitals by helicopter. One of the reasons the hospital became so busy treating Covid-19 patients, was that inhabitants of North Brabant that got the virus became much more ill than other Dutchmen. This became visible when maps of victims of Q fever and Corona, and the presence of Intensive animal farming were shown side by side. The correlation was clear, but the causality was less clear. Ignas van Bebber, a surgeon of the JBZ was already involved in research of the effects of particulates. He blamed the high amount of ammonia emitted by animal farms for causing permanent damage to the lung tissue of people living close by. People in Breda and Tilburg celebrated carnival just as well as the people east of 's-Hertogenbosch. However, the air pollution east of 's-Hertogenbosch caused that people living there were much more likely to die from an infection. Services = Locations = The hospital serves an area of 360.000 inhabitants. Therefore there are multiple auxiliary locations in 's-Hertogenbosch and surroundings. Some of them, like the one in Boxtel offer advanced diagnostics. Most of them are simple posts for blood tests, collection of urine or feces samples, or to investigate for possible thrombosis. * Location 's-Hertogenbosch (Henri Dunantstraat 1) (primary location) * Location Boxtel (Liduinahof 35) * Location Drunen (Tinie de Munnikstraat 17) * Location Rosmalen (De Hoef 90) * Location Zaltbommel (Kerkstraat 1 en Gamerschestraat 32a) * Jeroen Bosch Diagnostics (several locations primarily for blood tests in and near 's-Hertogenbosch) * Sport Medical Center (Marathonloop 9 in 's-Hertogenbosch) * Thrombosis services (severals posts in and near 's-Hertogenbosch) = Specializations, research and education = The Jeroen Bosch hospital has 4,000 employees and 240 physicians and surgeons in 29 medical specialisms. These offer almost any medical specialism, leading to a yearly total of 500,000 outpatient treatments, and 60,000 inpatient treatments. It also performs research. Education and training is part of the mission of Jeroen Bosch Hospital. The hospital trains new doctors. I.e. doctors which have already attended university elsewhere learn a medical specialism in the hospital. For new nurses there is a school that combines theoretical and practical education. The specialist rehabilatation hospital Tolbrug is connected to the hospital. It helps patients to rejoin society after severe disease or injury. As a rehabilitation hospital it stands at some distance from the organization of regular hospital care. E.g. the negotiations with insurance companies about rehabilitation care are done separately. It makes that Tolbrug reports only to the executive board of the hospital, and that it e.g. has a separate entrance near the main entrance of the hospital.

The organization is seated in Washington, D.C..  Background  In August 2020, Epic Games updated their Fortnite Battle Royale game app on both Apple's App Store and Google's Google Play to include its own storefront that offered a 20% discount on V-Bucks, the in-game currency, if players bought through there rather than through the app stores' storefront, both which take a 30% revenue cut of the sale. Both Apple and Google removed the Fortnite app within hours, as this alternate storefront violated their terms of use that required all in-app purchases to be made through their storefronts. Epic immediately filed lawsuits against both companies challenging their storefront policies on antitrust principles, arguing that their non-negotiable 30% revenue cut is too high and the restrictions against alternate storefronts anticompetitive. Apple has countersued Epic over their behavior, with their suit expected to go to bench trial in 2021, while Google seeks a compromise with Epic. This lead to both Apple and Google to remove the Fortnite app from their stores. The coalition criticizes the fact that for now the app stores of both Apple and Google charge their clients a 30% fee on any purchases made over their stores. Apple and Google defended themselves by arguing that the 30% transaction fee is a standard in the industry while the Coalition for App Fairness states that there is no other transaction fee which is even close to the 30%. = Foundation = On the 24 September 2020, Epic Games joined forces with thirteen other prominent companies like the music streaming platform Spotify, Match Group who owns the online dating app Tinder, the encrypted mail service ProtonMail and the crypto currency website Blockchain amongst others and established the Coalition for App Fairness.  Aims  The group has broadened their demands for the app stores and now also aim for a better treatment for the apps available in the App Store. They claim that Apple favors its own services before other services available on the market. The group has also been viewing other transaction fees like the 5% fee which is charged by credit card companies, and states that Apple charges up to 600% more and would like the 30% fee, which was only included in 2011 by Apple, adapted to a comparable percentage that charge other providers of payment solutions. Its demands are mainly directed at Apples strict control over its App Store, but to a lesser extent are also directed towards Google. Google allows apps to be downloaded over an independent web link or also another App Store, such as the Epic Game App Store. The organization emphasizes that no app developer should come into the position in which he is discriminated and is not granted the same rights as to the developers of the owner of the app store.

Characters =Drifters= The titular Drifters are heroes, leaders, and great warriors from different eras and cultures that have been brought to an unknown world by Murasaki, where they are meant to fight the Ends. A common element to the Drifters is that, although they are driven by violence, victory, and conquest, most of them are not cruel and do not tolerate the hurting of innocents. Unlike the Ends, the Drifters have no magic abilities unless they were born with them, and therefore must largely rely on their technology and tenacity to survive. ; : :A mysterious and calm bespectacled man who is responsible for the appearance of the Drifters, using them as a means to right the wrong of the Ends' conquest of the unknown world. He is seen sitting in the middle of the door corridor, smoking, and reading a newspaper that gives news of the events relating to the Drifters. In the corridor, he is associated with and accompanied by light. ; : :The leader of the Drifters. Historically, he died in 1600 during the Battle of Sekigahara. When he first arrived in the new world, he was critically injured, only to be brought to Nobunaga and Yoichi's hideout by the young elves, Marsha and Mark. Although impulsive and reckless, Toyohisa possesses a fearless, determined, and chivalrous spirit, assisting the elves and dwarves by liberating them from the Orte Empire. Born and raised in a war-torn era, Toyohisa has a keen sense for battle and tactics, though he remains unaware of these talents himself. Toyohisa primarily uses a nodachi in battle, though he is seen carrying a wakizashi. He also carries a Tanegashima on the back of his waist, which he only uses when his swords are infeasible to use against his enemies. ; : :A famous warlord who conquered most of Japan during Sengoku period. He is known for being the daimy≈ç who took the first step of unification of the Japan, and the first Japanese military commander to utilize arquebuses in battles, using one as his main weapon in battle as a Drifter. Historically, he died during the Honn≈ç-ji incident, the mutiny conducted by Akechi Mitsuhide. As a Drifter, he has only aged six months since arriving in the new world. Nobunaga is highly ambitious and cunning, desiring to establish a multiracial federation in the new world with Toyohisa as their leader. Nobunaga acts as the group's military strategist. ; : :A very effeminate man of nineteen. His full name is , though he is simply known as Nasu no Yoichi. Although he lived hundreds of years before Nobunaga and Toyohisa, Yoichi is the youngest in the group. Born as the youngest of eleven siblings, Yoichi is a powerful warrior and military commander who served Minamoto no Yoshitsune during the Genpei War. Yoichi's exploits were recorded throughout Japanese history, including in The Tale of the Heike, though Nobunaga notes that Yoichi acts very differently from these historical accounts. During the Genpei War, he was forced to commit several dishonorable acts by Yoshitsune, despite having a strong belief of Bushido. Now as a Drifter, Yoichi resolves to maintain his honorable nature, and he is the most level-headed of the trio. Yoichi acts as the group's archer, killing fleeing enemies. ; : :A famous Carthiginian military commander. Now a Drifter and elderly, he is first seen arguing with Scipio Africanus over the latter's \\"plagiarism\\" of Cannae at the Battle of Zama. Despite nearly being killed by the Black King's army, Hannibal still insists that victory is still possible. After being separated from Scipio, Hannibal becomes depressed and senile, but he is still able to articulate battle tactics to his fellow Drifters via indirect means. He acts as Nobunaga's military advisor since being left in Toyohisa's group's care. ; : :Hannibal's Roman adversary during the Second Punic War. As a Drifter, he is as old as Hannibal, who he is seen constantly arguing with, claiming that \\"a winner takes all\\" since he won at Zama. Nevertheless, Scipio respects Hannibal greatly. Originally traveling with Hannibal and the Wild Bunch gang, he was accidentally separated from them and is currently in the company of Naoshi Kanno and Tamon Yamaguchi. ; : :Leader of the Wild Bunch gang. He, along with Sundance Kid, was transported from Bolivia, and is now fighting against the Black King and his armies. Unlike his partner, Butch has a hot-blooded and wild personality. He favors the use of firearms, particularly a pair of pistols, in battle. ; : :A member of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch. He, along with Butch, was transported from Bolivia, and is now fighting against the Black King and his armies. Unlike his leader, Kid possesses a calm and collected personality. Kid favors the use of firearms in battle, such as shotguns and a Gatling gun. ;Naoshi Kanno : :During a battle with the Black King, with the Drifters' side under attack by dragons, Japanese World War II fighter pilot Naoshi Kanno is transported into the world in his plane. When the dragons' attacks trigger memories of the bombing of Tokyo, he attacks the dragons in anger. His plane later crashed and he soon found himself worshiped as a god by a tribe of anthropomorphic dogs, only to be found by Scipio, who decides to use his status to unite the various anthropomorphic animal tribes under him to bolster the Drifters' army. He does not initially trust Butch or Sundance Kid, as they are American, but Butch manages to convince him that they are Bolivian instead. He is addressed as Sugano Nao in the Dark Horse translation, an alternate reading of his name. ; : :An admiral of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Tamon arrived in the new world along with the aircraft carrier Hiry≈´, and has since formed an uneasy alliance with the leaders of Gu-Binnen, a merchant guild, assisting them against the war with the Orte Empire by leading the guild's griffin naval forces. =Ends= The opposing force in the unknown world and primary antagonists of the series, the Ends are, like the Drifters, mainly composed of powerful historical figures who died under unorthodox and often violent circumstances. Unlike the Drifters, however, the Ends are revered humans that have forsaken their humanity, and are thus capable of using supernatural powers. Most of the Ends are driven completely by an intense hate for humanity for the various betrayals each suffered back on Earth. They seem to have been brought into the new world by EASY, who is at odds with Murasaki. ; : :An arrogant and short-tempered young woman with long, black hair, and violet eyes. Apparently at odds with Murasaki, she is responsible for the Ends, an opposing force similar in origin to the Drifters. She primarily uses her laptop to keep tabs on the battles taking place in the other world. In the corridor, she is associated with and accompanied by darkness. ; : :The leader of the Ends. He claims that he once tried to \\"save\\" humans, but he has since shifted his agenda towards non-humans after humans \\"denied\\" his efforts. His identity has yet to be established, but he is shown to possess healing powers and the ability to multiply any life form he wishes, infinitely producing food or wood. He also has puncture scars in both of his palms. His ultimate goal is to eradicate all humans and create a new civilization of non-humans in a perpetual Dark Age, ensuring that they never advance far enough to become as destructive as humans, creating what the Black King believes will be a utopia. In order to achieve this, the Black King has instructed Rasputin to create a simple alphabet and a syncretic religion to allow the different non-human races to find a common ground. ; : :The former vice-commander of the Shinsengumi who died fighting in the name of the Tokugawa Bakufu during the Boshin War. Hijikata has the ability to use smoke to manifest ghostly images of members of the Shinsengumi and uses them to cut apart his enemies. He has become Toyohisa's rival following a battle between the two that ended in a draw. ; : :The heroine of the Hundred Years' War between France and England. Jeanne, who was driven insane after being burned at the stake, now desires nothing more than to see the world burn. As an End - with her Christian crosses now upside down - she has manifested the ability to manipulate fire. Surprisingly, she seems to be self-conscious of her (lacking) femininity, though this could be another result of her insanity. Upon facing Toyohisa, she felt true fear for the first time at fighting someone willing to die in order to win. After being defeated by Toyohisa, Jeanne is able to flee the scene alive due to Toyohisa's personal oath to never kill a woman, leading Jeanne to vow revenge for the humiliation. ; : :A French nobleman who was once one of Jeanne's companions-in-arms, but was later executed for multiple cases of alleged murder, sodomy, and heresy. He possessed incredible strength and durability. He continued to accompany Jeanne to battle as a spearman, remaining loyal to her until his death. He was defeated by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, whereafter he disintegrated into salt. An enraged Jeanne swears to avenge Gilles de Rais's death. He is the first of the Ends to be killed in the series. ; (–ê–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∞—Å–∏—è –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–Ω–∞ –†–æ–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞) : :The youngest daughter of the last Russian tsar, Nicholas II. Anastasia and her family were shot by a Bolshevik firing squad when Anastasia was seventeen. She has the supernatural ability to create blizzards. Anastasia is depicted as an emotionless woman with little interest in the war between the Ends and Drifters. Though they are often at odds due to opposing elements and views, she is believed to have some level of respect for Jeanne, as Rasputin believes that she was angered that Jeanne was humiliated during her battle against Toyohisa. ; (–ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä–∏–π –ï—Ñ–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á –†–∞—Å–ø—É—Ç–∏–Ω) : :A famous Russian mystic who once held a great influence over the Russian Imperial Court because of his ability to supposedly heal the Romanov's hemophiliac heir, Alexei. He now serves the Black King as a spymaster for his army, and is often seen by Anastasia's side. Similar to the Octobrists, Rasputin uses magic to possess others via the use of talismans, which he also uses for communication among the Black King's army. He seems to have a history with Count Saint-Germi as both recognize each other's works and political positions. ; : :A former general and samurai who served under Nobunaga before his betrayal in 1582, resulting in the latter's (historical) death during the Honn≈ç-ji incident. He is eager to kill Nobunaga during the war between the Drifters and the Ends. ; : :A ruthless general of the Minamoto clan and Nasu no Yoichi's former commander. During the Genpei War, Yoshitsune resorted to dishonorable tactics to achieve victory, something Yoichi despises about him. Likewise, Yoshitsune mocks Yoichi for trying to follow the code of Bushido once they are transported to the new world to fight. His status as a Drifter or End is unknown, and he often remarks that he will go the side that provides him with the most amusement. Yoshitsune is currently aligned with the Black King's army. =Orte Empire= The is a country that was established by Hitler. It expanded through the conquest of neighboring territories and continued to adhere to Hitler's principles, which involves the persecution of demihumans races. Recently, the Empire was sold to Toyohisa and the Drifters by Count Saint-Germi, as Hitler had bankrupted the empire before his death. Its capital is . ; :The infamous F√ºhrer and Chancellor of Nazi Germany. Revealed to be a Drifter by Count Saint-Germi, Hitler ended up in the current world fifty years before the current storyline and inspired the local humans through speeches at a tavern to rise up and form the Orte Empire, creating brutal discrimination laws against all non-human species living there at the time. He mysteriously committed suicide soon after; however, his followers continued to revere him as the \\"Father\\" of their country long after his death. ; : :A nobleman and Drifter who owns a quarter of the Orte Empire and was Hitler's closest ally in its formation. It is said that the Empire could not have existed without his \\"betrayal\\", and as such, he is free to live as he pleases without criticism from any of his peers. Despite this position, however, he is not loyal to the Empire and later betrays the Empire when he realizes its impending demise. He forms an alliance with the Drifters and their allies to take over the Empire. In spite of the fact he is well over fifty years old, Saint-Germi appears as a youthful drag queen with an effeminate personality. He has knowledge of the modern era (due to the fact that he is aware of the existence of firearms and gunpowder), as well as some knowledge of Japanese history. ; : :A former tax collector of the elvish colonies. He now works for the elves as a servant. ; : :A cold-blooded knight of the Orte Empire. After being brutally defeated by Toyohisa, he is killed by the elves out of retribution for massacring their people. ; : :An aide to Count Saint-Germi. ; : :An aide to Count Saint-Germi. ;Sacred Band of Thebes :A Greek troop made up entirely of pairs of male lovers. They initially worked for the Orte Empire under Count Saint-Germi, but are handed over to Nobunaga after they arrive in Orte. They are armed with Nobunaga's dwarven muskets and decimate the Black King's troops, cutting a path for Toyohisa and the dwarves to reach Hijikata. =The Octobrist Organization= The are a group of human magicians that are native to the world whose duty is to observe and gather the Drifters together to fight the Ends. Unlike many humans in this world, Octobrists do not subjugate the demihumans. It is led by Abe no Seimei, who is also a Drifter. Known as in the Dark Horse translation. ; : :Although his real name is Abe no Haruakira, Haruakira is known famously as Abe no Seimei, a legendary Japanese magician who devoted his life to the extermination of the Ends soon after he first appeared in the new world as a Drifter. He now serves as the leader of the Octobrist Organization. ; : :A young magician of the Octobrists, code name \\"\\". She is charged with watching Toyohisa's group of Drifters. She seems to be quite incompetent at reconnaissance, and is terrified of the Drifters she must follow. After she is discovered and kidnapped by Toyohisa's group, she tells them the story of the Drifters and Ends. She is often used as comic relief, shown in a generally incompetent, powerless, and cowardly way, and is a frequent target of sexual harassment by Nobunaga (who calls her names such as \\"Olminipples\\"), but can be helpful due to her skills in sorcery, particularly in casting stone walls to assist the Drifters in their plans. Olminu can also serve as a spectator to the story, with the narrative enlightening plot elements through her perception. ; : :Kafet, code name \\"\\", is an assistant to Abe no Seimei. He was first charged with bringing Scipio and Hannibal to Seimei after their arrival to their world. =Elves= The elves are a race of demihumans with long, pointed ears. The elves are a community of hunters and gatherers living in small villages across neighboring territories. Elves live five to six times longer than normal humans, and their maturation rate is slower, thus making the elves appearing younger than they actually are. Fifty years prior to the current storyline, they were defeated in the war against the Orte Empire and were forced to live as serfs. Toyohisa liberated the elves to repay his debt to Marsha and Mark for helping him when he first arrived in the new world. They are the first demihuman race to join the Drifters' army in the war against the Orte Empire and the Ends. The elves are natural-born archers, and are led by Yoichi in battles. ; : :The younger brother of Shara and Marsha. Like the rest of his race, Mark appears as young adolescent boy, though he is actually thirty-six years old. He and Marsha first discovered a wounded Toyohisa when he arrived in their world, and helped him by bringing him to Nobunaga and Yoichi to get his injuries treated. Toyohisa repaid his debt to the brothers by saving them from the Orte soldiers that were trying to kill them and liberating their village from the Orte Empire's tyranny. ; : :The brother of Shara and Mark, and the second oldest child among the three. Like the rest of his race, Marsha appears as young adolescent boy, though he is actually thirty-nine years old. He and Mark first discovered a wounded Toyohisa when he arrived in their world, and helped him by bringing him to Nobunaga and Yoichi to get his injuries treated. Toyohisa repaid his debt to the brothers by saving them from the Orte soldiers that were trying to kill them and liberating their village from the Orte Empire's tyranny. ; : :The older brother of Mark and Marsha. Like the rest of his race, Shara appears as young man, though he is actually 106 years old. He helps lead the elvish rebellion against the Orte Empire after his father is killed by Aram. He is very loyal to Toyohisa and the other Drifters, and often acts as the representative among the elves. =Others= ; : :One of the six Great Dragons that govern the winged dragons. Although he objects to the employment of his subjects as the personal \\"pets\\" of the Black King, he is soon tortured with his powers and made into a living copper mine. ; : :A spy for the Oct who was later killed by Minamoto no Yoshitsune. ; : :A noblemen from Gu-Binnen, a merchant guild, who forms an uneasy alliance with Tamon in the war against the Orte Empire. Shylock is the secretary of the Shylock Bank and Trading House, and the admiral of Gu-Binnen's marine fleet. Calculating and astute, Shylock shows interest in obtaining Tamon's Hiry≈´, but refrains from doing so as not to incur Tamon's wrath.

He was also a member of the SS and the Wehrmacht. He was killed in action on the Russian Front in World War II. Early years The tenth child of a locomotive operator, he grew up in Regensburg. After high school, at the outbreak of World War I in 1914 he enlisted as a volunteer with the 11th Royal Bavarian Infantry Regiment. He attended officer training classes and was promoted to Leutnant in August 1916. In April 1917 he was wounded and taken prisoner by the French. He was awarded the Iron Cross, first and second class. He returned to Germany in April 1920, and was discharged from the service with a 20% disability. He resumed his education, training as an elementary school teacher in Amberg from 1920 to 1922. He passed his teaching examinations in December 1922. In 1923 he became an assistant teacher and in 1925 he was employed as a teacher. In 1930 he took up a teaching position in Auerbach in the Upper Palatinate (Oberpfalz). He was eventually dismissed from public school service on 1 November 1932 due to his political activities. Nazi career On 16 April 1927 Maierhofer joined the Nazi Party (membership number 59,524). He served as Bezirksleiter (District Leader) in Auerbach from 1927. He was named Deputy Gauleiter of the Upper Palatinate in November 1929 when Gauleiter Adolf Wagner was transferred to Greater Munich. As such, he administered the Gau until June 1930 when Edmund Heines came in as Acting Gauleiter. When Heines left to take up a staff position in the Sturmabteilung (SA) high command, Maierhofer was named Gauleiter of the Upper Palatinate on 15 November 1930. In September 1930 he was elected to the Reichstag from electoral constituency 25 (Lower Bavaria) and served only one term until the next election in 1932. In April 1931 he became the editor of a Nazi daily newspaper named Schaffendes Volk. On the resignation of Otto Erbersdobler of the neighboring Gau of Lower Bavaria (Niederbayern) on 1 April 1932, Maierhofer was assigned the leadership of that jurisdiction in addition to his own. On 17 August the Gaue of Upper Palatinate and Lower Bavaria were formally merged and Maierhofer became Gauleiter of the newly named Gau Lower Bavaria- Upper Palatinate (Niederbayern-Oberpfalz). However just several months later, the SA leadership of the Gau filed a complaint alleging that Maierhofer had not properly allocated money due to the SA. He was relieved of his office on 13 January 1933. On 19 January, his Gau was merged with Upper Franconia into Gau Bavarian-East March (Bayerische Ostmark) under the leadership of Hans Schemm, the Upper Franconian Gauleiter. In November 1933 Maierhofer joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) and held several staff positions between 1935 and 1937, including in the office of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS. On 20 April 1936 he attained the rank of SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer. In 1937 he secured a position with the Bavarian State government as an advisor in the Ministry of Education and Culture. In 1937 Maierhofer reentered military service as a Leutnant of the reserves. At the outbreak of World War II, he served on active duty with Infantry Regiment 50 of the 3rd Infantry Division. After 1941, he saw action on the Eastern Front, advancing to the rank of Hauptmann in July 1942. In February 1943 he was promoted to Major as commander of Grenadier Regiment 315 of the 167th Infantry Division, but was killed in action at the Fourth Battle of Kharkov on 22 August 1943.

Chamblis was honorably discharged from his service as a Marine during World War II and eventually relocated to Minnesota with his wife Jeanett in 1958. The couple had one daughter, Reva Chamblis. The couple divorced when Reva was two years old. At almost age thirty, Chamblis received his first camera, a one-step Polaroid, from Jeanett. He then took up documenting ‚Äúthe best‚Äù of the Black Twin Cities.  Photography  Commonly referred to as ‚ÄúThe Pictureman‚Äù to locals, Chamblis was known for circling North Minneapolis neighborhoods, capturing everyday black life in the Twin Cities. During the 1970s, Chamblis started to make a career for himself as a photographer of Black life in Minneapolis, occasionally landing more reliable freelance gigs, including Insight News and Minnesota‚Äôs Black Community.

Among other families, the T√∫z de Lak noble family descended from them. History Archaeologist K√°lm√°n Magyar argued the B≈ë clan was one of the ancient ethnic Hungarian kindreds which had participated in the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in late 9th century. Along with chieftain Bog√°t's kinship, they settled in Somogy County south to Somogyv√°r and centered around B≈ë (present-day wasteland near Somogyj√°d). Fels≈ëb≈ë and Als√≥b≈ë (lit. \\"Upper B≈ë\\" and \\"Lower B≈ë\\", respectively) are today part of the village Bodrog. Historian Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy considered B≈ë, ancestor of the kindred belonged to the escort of Bog√°t and occupied the northern watersheds between Lake Balaton and the Drava river. According to Gy√∂rffy, the name B≈ë derived from the same ancient Hungarian word means \\"rich\\". Members of the clan erected a monastery dedicated to the Holy Cross in B≈ë, at the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries. By 1329, the provostship of B≈ë became a place of authentication. The ruins of the monastery was excavated by K√°lm√°n Magyar between 1979 and 1982. =Izs√©p (T√∫z) branch= The church of Gyugy The first known members of the kindred appeared in contemporary records only in the early 13th century. Two branches ‚Äì T√∫z (or Izs√©p) and Ders ‚Äì elevated by that time. Izs√©p, son of John, entered the service of Prince Coloman, King B√©la IV's brother. Izs√©p acquired a portion of the village Gyugy in the 1230s. Local traditions say he built the still preserved church there. He was killed in the Battle of Mohi. He had three children: John II (fl. 1241‚Äì82), Henry and a daughter.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus B≈ë 1., Somogy branch 1‚Äì3.) John II, who survived the aforementioned battle, inherited his father's possessions in Somogy County, including B≈ë with its clan monastery, half of Magyari (today Buzs√°k) and a portion of Gyugy. John also owned portions in the nearby villages Szentm√°rton (today part of Mez≈ëcsokonya) and Bodrog. As a daughters' quarter, John handed over both properties to his unidentified sister. John sold the land Terebezd and the right of patronage over the B≈ë monastery to vice-judge royal Nicholas Tengerdi in 1257. John became one of the leading noblemen of Somogy County by the early 1260s, acted as judge in various local lawsuits. For his loyal service, he was granted the other half of Magyari by B√©la IV in 1268. John was a faithful soldier of King Ladislaus IV too, who donated a portion of K√∂lked to him in 1274. By that time, John also owned the villages Csavonya and ≈êr. John II had two sons: Trepk and John III. Although Trepk remained nominally loyal to Ladislaus IV then Andrew III, alongside other local nobles, he was forced to acknowledge the legitimacy of the court of oligarch Henry K≈ëszegi, who extended his influence over southeastern Transdanubia, including Somogy County by the early 14th century. It is possible that Trepk divided his fortune between his sons Peter I, John IV, Stephen and Nicholas. They were ancestors of the L√©tai, T√∫z de Lak, K√ºrt√∂si (Messer) and S√∂rnyei families, respectively. Peter was a page in the royal court of Charles I of Hungary. He possessed landholdings in Sz≈ëcs√©ny and L√©ta (today part of Somogyzsitfa). His brother John IV owned the area of K√∂lked and Lak. His elder son Peter II (\\"the T√∫z\\") was the progenitor of the T√∫z family, which flourished in the second half of the 15th century, elevating into the most powerful families for a brief time. Another son Andrew was murdered by a local noble Stephen K√©thelyi in 1348. Trepk's third son Stephen owned K√ºrt√∂s (today part of Pusztakov√°csi. The K√ºrt√∂si family split into several sub- branches in the upcoming decades. The fourth son Nicholas possessed S√∂rnye (today part of Somogys√°rd). One of his sons Michael served as vice-judge royal during the reign of Louis I. His another son Andrew functioned as provost of B≈ë, when he was \\"brutally attacked\\" by a local noble Andrew De√°k (\\"literatus\\") in 1377.

He served as curialis comes of Somogy County in 1266, a precursor office of the position vice-isp√°n (de facto administrator of the county). A contemporary of his distant relative John II (see above), Stephen was one of the four noble judges () in Somogy County since the early 1260s. Although Stephen originated from a relatively less significant branch of the B≈ë clan, his sister married Gregory II Monoszl√≥, a prominent landowner in Southern Transdanubia and Slavonia. The marriage resulted the rapid political and social grow of Stephen's two sons Michael and Peter \\"the Toothed\\" by the end of the 14th century, as their cousins were the influential barons Egyed, Gregory III and prelate Peter Monoszl√≥. When the latter became Bishop of Transylvania, Michael B≈ë was made as his grand provost. Subsequently, he served as Bishop of Zagreb, then Archbishop of Esztergom.

When a Beaver graduates from the third year of the program, they become Cub Scouts. The Scouts Canada section of Beaver Scouts was first inspired by the Beavers which began in Northern Ireland, named so in 1966. It began as an independent group in 1971, until absorbed by Scouts Canada in 1974. Scouts Canada's Beaver Scouts has, in turn, been the inspiration for many other divisions of Beavers scouts across the world.  History and founding  The Canadian Beavers program was developed by three people: Harry McCartney, who was the Manitoba Executive Scout Director and the author of the short story Friends of the Forest; Alan Jones, who was a Winnipeg Scout Executive; and Gordon Hanna, who was part of the United Way Youth Council and was asked by McCartney to be the project's coordinator. As concepts were developed by Jones and Hanna, McCartney would write the next chapter of Friends of the Forest. A one month grant from the United Way was provided to hire Gordon Hanna as the Project Coordinator to help develop and practically test the concepts. Three colonies were initially started in 3 parts of Winnipeg to pilot the ideas: Elmwood, St. James and St. Vital. The first colony in Elmwood had 13 boys join on Sept. 23rd, 1971. The program was an immediate success and grew exponentially. It was made an official part of Scouts Canada in 1974.  Uniform  When in uniform, members normally wear a brown vest, a blue and brown bucket hat (with a tail signifying their year in the program), and an optional neckerchief in purple and blue. A diagram of the uniform, including placement of awards and crests, is provided on the Scouts Canada Website.  Symbols  = Investiture and Tail Ceremony = A new Beaver is called a \\"Kit\\"; a Kit must learn the Beaver Promise, Law, and Motto, and go through the Investiture and Tail Ceremony to become an \\"Eager Beaver\\". The ceremony officially welcomes the Beaver into the Beaver program, and during this ceremony the Beaver receives a tail, neckerchief, and badges for their uniform. The color of the tail received is affixed to the back of their uniform hat, and represents their age: * Brown tails are given to Beavers who begin the scouting year at 5 years of age * Blue tails are given to Beavers who begin the scouting year at 6 years of age * White tails are given to Beavers who begin the scouting year at 7 years of age Beaver scouts must learn the Beaver Scouts promise, law, and motto. * Promise: \\"I promise to love God and help take care of the world.\\" * * Law: \\"A Beaver has fun, works hard and helps family and friends.\\" * Motto: \\"Sharing, Sharing, Sharing\\" = Friends of the Forest = Many of the ideas incorporated into Beaver Scouts lore originate in Founder Harry McCarthy's short story Friends of the Forest, where a colony of beavers discover new humans building a cottage upriver, and befriend them. The story provides many inspirations for names and symbols used in Beaver Scouts, including nicknames that may be given to adult and cub scout leaders; the core values of sharing and cooperation; and the graduation of Eager Beavers into Wolf Cub Scouts. = Structure = An organized group of Beaver Scouts is called a Colony, and optional smaller groups inside the colony are called Lodges. These are analogous to Packs and Lairs, respectively, at the Cub Scout level. Lodges can be given animal names as chosen by the Lodge members. Adult and older leaders inside the colony are referred to as Scouters, and they may have given to them one of the nicknames from Friends of the Forest, such as Hawkeye, Tic Tac, or Echo. A colony may also be assisted by second-year Cub Scouts (Trackers). New Cub Scout Tracker volunteers are given the nickname Grey Paw, and if they help frequently, they may be given a permanent wolf nickname by the colony. Beaver colonies and/or their lodges meet frequently, to engage in activities, games, skits, storytelling; all of which are done to help a Beaver along their personal achievement path on The Pond. A beaver's Pond map stays with them and is updated throughout their days in Beaver Scouting; it is not reset each year. = Swim-up Ceremony = At the end of a white tail's year, they have the option to participate in a Swim-up Ceremony, in which they are formally graduated from Beaver Scouts and into first year Cub Scouts, as Wolf Runners.  Badges  Several classes of badges are made available to Beaver Scouts: * Personal Achievement Badges * Outdoor Adventure Skills Badges * The North Star Award, available to third-year white tails by completing the Northern Lights Quest * The Canadian Path Link Badge (for Beaver Scouts, showing their progression to Cub Scouts)  Footnotes   References  Category:Scouting and Guiding in Canada ","title":"Beaver Scouts (Scouts Canada)"},{"id":"65428361","text":"Emmanuel Episcopal Church is a historic Episcopal church at 203 S.

Architect John Neal Tilton, Jr., who was also a member of the congregation, gave the new church a Gothic Revival design inspired by cathedral architecture; the design bucked the contemporary tradition of giving suburban churches simple designs.

It was the first episode of the second season and featured Jack Palance in the role of Manolete. Producer Martin Manulis later called it \\"the classic clinker of all time.\\" Plot The play told the story of the Spanish bullfighter Manolete. Manolete was the idol of Spain and had made four million dollars when he was killed in the bullring at age 30. Cast The cast included performances by: * Jack Palance as Manolete * Suzy Parker as Tani Morena (Manolete's mistress) * Robert Middleton as Perea * Ray Danton as Antonito * Nehemiah Persoff as Camara (Manolete's manager) * Esther Minciotti as Augustias Production Barnaby Conrad approached producer Martin Manulis and director John Frankenheimer proposing to turn his upcoming book The Death of Manolete into a production for Playhouse 90. Manulis and Frankenheimer were both enthusiastic about the idea and decided to open the second season with the project. Unfortunately, Manulis later recalled, it turned out to be \\"the classic clinker of all time.\\" He cited several reasons for the failure: * First, Manulis wondered how they thought they could shoot the climactic bullfight scene using a fake bull's head that was jerked up down by a couple of stagehands jerking lying just below the camera's view. Paul Monash, who adapted the book for television, also recalled the use of the fake bull's head as \\"one great mistake.\\" * Second, Jack Palance's outfit was drooping at the back and made him look like an old man. * Third, they could not find an actress willing to play the part of Manolete's mistress. They finally settled on Suzy Parker who had \\"promised her mother she would never act and didn't break her promise.\\" Despite the poor quality of the production, it drew attention when \\"every comic in town\\" did a parody of the program. Because of the difficulties with presenting a bullfight on live television, the production relied heavily on film clips of Manolete's performances. Reception In The New York Times, Jack Gould wrote the production \\"never deeply involved the viewer or gave a truly illuminating insight into the man.\\" He did praise John Frankenheimer who \\"technically integrated\\" the newsreel scenes with the live scenes. Critic John Crosby called it \\"large, noisy and disappointing.\\" He also wrote that Suzy Parker could hardly be described as a good actress and \\"should never open her mouth.\\" In the New York Daily News, Kay Gardell wrote that \\"it was more a mood piece than an exciting drama\\" and \\"fell short of hitting a bull's-eye.\\" However, she praised Palance's \\"taut and terrifying\\" portrayal of Manolete.

History The project was announced in July 2015 by Puebla State Governor Rafael Moreno Valle Rosas. Construction began in November 2015 and was completed in early 2017 when it was inaugurated by President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto and Governor Moreno Valle. Initially budgeted to cost 800 million pesos, final project costs totaled 1,113 million pesos. Route The single-track route largely utilizes existing rail rights-of-way to the north and west of Puebla City. The route begins at the Mexican National Railway Museum in Puebla's city centre. The first of the route operates as a tram line without any stops along city streets with mixed vehicle traffic. The remainder of the route utilizes a dedicated at-grade right-of-way from Puebla City to Cholula Station adjacent to the Cholula Archaeological Zone. An additional two intermediate stops, Mercado Hidalgo Station and Momoxpan Station, were constructed but have not been opened. Operations The Puebla-Cholula Tourist Train's rolling stock consists of two 3-car diesel-electric -long trains supplied by Vossloh. The trains have a capacity of 284 people. Average train speed is 30km/hr and the approximate travel time between Puebla and Cholula is 40 minutes. There are three daily departures from each terminal on weekdays and nine daily departures from each terminal on weekends and holidays. Total passengers in 2019 numbered 161,377 users.
