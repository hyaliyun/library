Biography  Jessie Lavington Evans was born in Albury, New South Wales on 25 March 1860 and died in Brighton, Victoria on 12 May 1943.Ancestry database, Memorial ID - 150721815 She sometimes is referred to Jessie Laver Evans. She was one of three sisters. Her father was a storekeeper on the Murray River for many years. One of her sisters Ethel Amelia Murray Evans devoted her time to music, while Jessie Evans painted the Brighton scene.  Career  Jessie Lavington Evans attended the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1880 and her fellow students that year included Tom Roberts, E Phillips Fox, Frederick McCubbin, while Julian Ashton and Rupert Bunny joined in 1881 and Arthur Streeton attended in 1882. Jessie Lavington Evans was a well-known artist, born in Albury in the 1860 and she was the daughter of William Bird Evans who managed T.H Mates Store. Jessie is reputed to have painted the portrait of Thomas and Charlotte Mitchell, early settlers in the area. For more than fifty years, Jessie L. Evans lived with her family at \\"Clifton\\" 14 Dendy Road, Brighton (one block from beach), but was never allowed to work or sell her artworks because it would cast aspersions on her father‚Äôs and the family‚Äôs ability to support her. However, between 1896 and 1899, she maintained an artist‚Äôs studio at 123 & 125 William Street and later 230 Collins Street. In 1880, Jessie L. Evans exhibited at the Intercolonial Industrial Exhibition in Melbourne. She received her artistic training at the National Gallery of Victoria School (1880-1891; 1903- 1904) under Fred McCubbin and George Folingsby, being awarded (1888) 2nd Prize for Still-Life and (1890) 2nd Prize for Best Drawing from Antique. Between 1894 and 1898, she also studied at the Melbourne School of Art under E. Phillips Fox and Tudor St George Tucker, being awarded (1894 and 1897) Prizes for Landscape. In 1890, the Table Talk's art critic said of her interior painting \\"There is clever painting in every detail of the picture, and the drawing is certain,...\\" and of a portrait \\"‚Ä¶a good portrait, finely modelled and free of any suggestion of slap-dash execution.\\" and of a flower piece \\"is crisply and vigorously painted.\\" and of a study of drapery\\" the management of light and shade is noticeably good.\\" In Melbourne, Jessie L. Evans exhibited at student exhibitions at the National Gallery of Victoria and the Melbourne School of Art, and at the Victorian Artists Society until 1896, her artworks always receiving good comments from the art critics. In the late-1890s, Jessie L. Evans had to withdraw from exhibiting and selling her artworks because her father felt that exhibiting artworks for sale was unladylike and cast aspersions upon his ability to support his family. Throughout her adult life, Jessie‚Äôs career was simply listed as \\"house duties.\\"  References  = Footnotes = = Sources = * * Category:19th-century Australian women artists Category:20th-century Australian women artists Category:1860 births Category:1943 deaths ","title":"Jessie Lavington Evans"},{"id":"65208553","title":"ISO 22396"},{"id":"65208562","text":"Raimbek Matraimov (born 3 May 1971) is a Kyrgyz politician. He was the deputy chair of the State Customs Service of Kyrgyzstan (2015 ‚Äì 2017). After being fired in late 2017, Matraimov became a central figure in an ongoing large scale money-laundering case, one of the biggest scandals in the history of Kyrgyz politics.  Early life  Matraimov was born in the village of Agartuu, in Kara-Suu district of Osh oblast, Kyrgyzstan. He started working at the State Customs Service in 1997 as a regular inspector. In 2004 he started his steady rise within the service: he was first appointed head of the human resources department at the Southern department of the State Customs Service, a year later he became deputy head of the Southern department. His longest managing position tenure lasted for six years: from 2007 till 2013 Matraimov was head of Osh department of the State Customs Service. In 2013 he was promoted to chair the whole Southern department, of which Osh department was part of. Finally, in 2015 he became deputy chairman of the whole State Customs Service, his highest government position to date.  Accusations of corruption  = Earliest accusations = First reports that Matraimov had significant unexplained wealth surfaced in 2017, when a number of Kyrgyz media outlets wrote stories about sports clubs that Matraimov had built around his native Southern part of Kyrgyzstan and about a luxurious mansion that he built for himself in the center of Osh, the second biggest city in the country. Matraimov denied claims made by journalists, but despite this he was fired by then president of Kyrgyzstan Almazbek Atambayev in November 2017. = Major investigations = After Atambayev stepped down as the president in December 2017, Matraimov filed a lawsuit against the state, and in 2018 the court made a decision to reinstate him as the deputy head of the Customs Service. Despite the court decision, Matraimov preferred not to return to the position, but at the same time he switched to a more public lifestyle. Previously known as a government official who had barely ever given a single interview to the media, Matraimov released his first ever video statement in May 2019. He again denied any allegations of corruption, and said that he was a victim of a smear campaign by the former president Atambayev. In the same month, the charity foundation run by Matraimov's family organized a volleyball tournament in Osh oblast of Kyrgyzstan, and a number of high-profile Kyrgyz politicians visited it, including Dastan Jumabekov, speaker of the Kyrgyz parliament, and Kubatbek Boronov, then vice prime minister of Kyrgyzstan. Despite this display of his connections in politics, Matraimov kept being a central figure in further corruption investigations by Kyrgyz journalists. On May 30, 2019, the Kyrgyz edition of Radio Liberty published its first major investigation about the possible source of wealth of Matraimov. In the investigation, Radio Liberty journalists claimed that Matraimov earned his wealth while being part of a corruption scheme that allowed a group of Chinese companies led by the secretive Abdukadyr family bring goods into Kyrgyzstan without paying any customs fees. One of the major sources of the investigation, a self-confessed money launderer Aierken Saimaiti who worked for Abdukadyrs, was murdered in Istanbul in November 2019. Although Matraimov denied any links with the murder of Saimaiti, the next part of the journalism investigation about him, heavily based on interviews with Saimaiti, was published on November 21, 2019, ten days after the assassination of Saimaiti. This time it was a joint investigation by Radio Liberty, OCCRP and Kloop, a Kyrgyz media outlet, and it revealed more details about the corruption schemes at the Kyrgyz customs service. According to November investigations, Matraimov not only backed illegal activities of the Abdukadyr family business, but got involved in at least one joint real estate project with them: Matraimov's wife Uulkan Turgunova was revealed to be a co-owner of an estate in Dubai together with one of the Abdukadyr family members. Neither Matraimov, nor his wife have ever had an official salary that would allow them to invest into such an expensive project. = Protests and lawsuit = Four days after the November publications, hundreds of people took part in a protest in front of the Kyrgyz government headquarters in Bishkek, demanding from authorities to investigate corruption scheme described in the new part of the journalism investigation. Matraimov and his family kept on denying all the accusations, and in December 2019 they filed a lawsuit against Radio Liberty and Kloop. While Reporters Without Borders named this lawsuit \\"absurd\\" and called on a court to dismiss it, this never happened. Matraimov and his family demand more than 700,000 Euros of compensation from media outlets, but there have not been any verdict given yet.  Personal life  Matraimov is married to Uulkan Turgunova, who appeared in journalism investigations alongside him. After analyzing Turgunova's private social media accounts, Kyrgyz journalists revealed she owned expensive watches and jewelry that she would not be able to afford with her official salary. Author of one of the stories about Turgunova was physically attacked in Bishkek in January 2020, three weeks after he published a story about her wealth. Iskender Matraimov, Raimbek's brother, has been a member of the Kyrgyz parliament since 2015. At the parliament elections in October 2020, Iskender Matraimov was a candidate from the Mekenim Kyrgyzstan party, which is believed to be heavily linked with the Matraimov family. Tilek Matraimov, another brother of Raimbek, is the head of Kara-Suu district administration.

The incident began with false reports of gunshots after a fight between two people on the Central line platform at Oxford Circus station. The panic coincided with Black Friday sales and the Christmas shopping season, and the streets of Oxford Street and Regent Street were full of shoppers. Many shops barricaded their doors, and the police issued warnings for people in Oxford Street to seek shelter immediately. In the resulting panic, several people were injured by falls and trampling, nine seriously enough to require hospital treatment. By 18:05 GMT, the police declared that there had been no gunshots or terrorism, and ended the incident. Background London had seen several terrorist attacks in 2017, including vehicle ramming attacks on Westminster Bridge in March and London Bridge in June, and an attempted train bombing in September. The terror threat level was \\"Severe\\" meaning that an attack was considered highly likely. Oxford Street and Regent Street are some of the UK's busiest shopping streets, and the incident occurred on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Ten days prior to the incident, a window cleaner was injured in a fall from a building on Oxford Street onto a lorry parked beneath. A Twitter post about this accident describing a lorry surrounded by blood stains would later be taken out of context during the panic as evidence of a non-existent vehicle attack. Incident At 16:38 GMT, there was an altercation between two men on the westbound Central line platform at Oxford Circus station, with some witnesses reporting hearing bangs. People began to flee the station from an exit at the junction between Oxford Street and Regent Street. Seeing this rush, others on the street, including passengers on passing buses, began to panic and ran away through the streets and into nearby shops and restaurants. In the resulting stampede, 16 people were injured, including eight people who needed hospital treatment for minor injuries and one who suffered serious leg trauma. The Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police responded with armed police and closed Oxford Circus station as well as nearby Bond Street station. The London Fire Brigade sent several fire engines to respond to the incident. In a tweet, Metropolitan Police told those in buildings to stay inside and those on Oxford Street to seek shelter. Police went from building to building searching for shooters. At 18:05 GMT, the police declared that there was no evidence of any gun shots and ended the state of emergency, although extra officers remained on the scene to reassure those caught up in the incident. =Media reporting and mass panic= After the first reports of apparent gunfire in Oxford Circus, news about an apparent terrorist attack spread rapidly, fuelled by both news media stories and social media postings. These posts are believed to have worsened the panic and caused it to spread further around the Oxford Circus area. Pop star Olly Murs, who had been in Selfridges Oxford Street store at the time, was particularly criticised for tweeting to 7.8 million followers \\"Fuck everyone get out of Selfridges now gun shots!! I'm inside.\\" Despite not hearing any gun fire or seeing any evidence of a terrorist attack, Murs continued to claim that there had been a shooting in Selfridges for months after the incident. The Daily Mail newspaper's website posted a story with the headline \\"'Gunshots fired' as armed police surround Oxford Circus station after 'lorry ploughs into pedestrians'\\". The piece, which spread as evidence of a terrorist attack, was actually based on a tweet about an unrelated accident 10 days earlier in which someone was injured by a fall onto a vehicle. The article was deleted quickly, and Mail Online apologised for the \\"grave error\\". Aftermath The Metropolitan Police issued CCTV footage of two people wanted for questioning for the initial altercation. Two men aged 21 and 40 handed themselves in to police the next day. They were released without charge, with the Metropolitan Police declaring that they were not searching for any further suspects. The incident has become a case study of mass delusions, the spread of misinformation on social media, and the need for clear information during serious incidents.

The society was named after the theatre play Ludlam's H√∂hle by Adam Oehlenschl√§ger. After the first performance on December 15th 1817, a group of \\"literati\\" (already existing since 1816) met in the \\"Haidvogels Gasthaus\\" (Schlosserg√§√üchen, Vienna) to discuss the performance. As this play had failed with the audience that evening, Castelli suggested giving the group the name \\"Ludlamsh√∂hle\\" as a consolation for the Danish writer. The adjoining room in \\"Haidvogel's Gasthaus\\", where the daily meeting at the regulars' table took place, was declared a clubhouse.Ludlamsh√∂hle: Bringing the 19th Century to the Present The Ludlamsh√∂hle did not pursue any political or artistic goals; the regulars' table every evening served without exception for social gatherings. From today's point of view, the Ludlamsh√∂hle is a prime example of the Biedermeier sociability. During the night of 18-19 April 1826, this society was suspected (unjustified by anything) of \\"endangering the state\\" and was banned. By order of the Viennese police chief Alois von Persa, more than 30 policemen occupied the inn, arrested those present and confiscated all manuscripts found. The private flats of the arrested \\"Ludlamites\\" were also searched until the early hours of the morning. Some of their members continued to suffer years of spying and other harassment. It was precisely this excessive action by the authorities that led to the mythification of the group and its members in the following years.Ludlamsh√∂hle on Aeiou A new member had to prove to the amusement of all that he was capable of increasing the pleasure of the society by joining. He was then examined in the subjects Ludlam History, Ludlam Finance and Frivolity Science, with several whispering seconds being given to the subject. After passing the exam, the new member was given a \\"Ludlam name\\" and the \\"recording song\\" was sung together. Various songs for the society have been preserved by Antonio Salieri, including the texts Es lebe Ludlam and O Gott, o Gott! d¬¥Ludlam ist todt. After 1848, an attempt was made to revive the Ludlamsh√∂hle, but it was a failure. In 1949, the writers , , Theodor Mayer, and joined together in Vienna to form a society called \\"Neue Ludlamsh√∂hle\\" which lasted until 1972. References Further reading * Adam G.

It corresponds to a person that, when given a set of items, evaluates them in the following way: * For each item j, there is a fixed value vj. * There is also a fixed budget B. * The value of the set of items is the minimum between B and the sum of values of items in the set. Budget-additive valuations are useful in the research of online advertising, combinatorial auctions, resource allocation, and market equilibrium.

In order to clarify its independence, GACVS members may not represent WHO in any way. The Committee was established by the WHO in 1999. As part of its responsibilities, GACVS oversees the Vaccine Safety Net.  Purpose  The purpose of the GACVS is to provide a ready group of independent experts that can advise the WHO on issues relating to vaccine safety, enabling the WHO to respond quickly and authoritatively with potential global importance. As part of its responsibilities, GACVS oversees the Vaccine Safety Net.  History and function  WHO established the GACVS in 1999 on a background of advances and increasing knowledge of vaccines accompanied by concerns relating to their safety and subsequent influence on public confidence in vaccine programmes. Its membership consists of 15 experts in several fields that touch on the topic of vaccine safety, including epidemiology, vaccinology, ethics, neurology, internal medicine, and autoimmunity. An example of an issue, on which the Committee might be called to provide guidance, is the matter of short- and long-term national vaccination programmes. According to its 2017 terms of reference, the Committee: * reviews up-to-date knowledge around vaccine safety, * identifies causal relationships * creates task forces as required and when needed * makes recommendations to the WHO * cascades its findings by various means. Members are nominated by the Director of WHO's Department of Essential Medicines and Health Products, and are appointed for an initial term of three years. Current members can only be renewed for one additional term. To maintain independence in advising, it reports that its members may not represent WHO \\"in any capacity or in any forum.\\" Current and former members of the GACVS can be found on the official website. The group meets twice yearly and publishes its findings in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record. Engagements and topics undertaken by the GACVS include the safety of immunization during pregnancy. The GACVS is also aware of its increasing responsibility towards low- and middle-income countries that make vaccines for export. = Vaccine Hesitancy = The GACVS aims to respond quickly and authoritatively in addressing vaccine-related adverse effects, thereby maintaining confidence in vaccines and immunisation coverage with the result that the incidence of disease falls. The GACVS evaluates and interprets reports of adverse effects of vaccines that impact on international vaccination programmes, helping to develop better surveillance systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It also oversees the development of new vaccines throughout clinical testing. The GACVS has been involved in issues relating to vaccine hesitancy regarding several vaccines including vaccines for measles, influenza, human papilloma virus, Japanese encephalitis, rotavirus and hepatitis B.  Evaluation  Upon the 15-year anniversary of the GACVS, a number of members reviewed the Committee's contributions and ongoing challenges.

Alternative forms of the catchphrase include \\"hurting the feelings of 1.3 billion people\\" () and \\"hurting the feelings of the Chinese race\\" (). Origin The phrase first appeared in 1959 in the People's Daily, where it was used to criticise India following a border dispute. In the decades that followed, the phrase has been regularly used to express displeasure of the Chinese government via its various official communication channels. Targets accused of having \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\" range from national governments and international organisations, to companies such as automakers, newspapers, luxury jewellers, and hotel chains, in addition to outspoken individuals including sportspeople, business executives, film actors, and music performers. Phraseology The occurrence of \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\" within the People's Daily by each year. A study conducted by David Bandurski as part of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong selected 143 text samples of the phrase from excerpts from the People's Daily published between 1959 and 2015; from this sample, Japan was most frequently accused of \\"hurting the feelings of the Chinese people\\" with 51 occurrences, while the United States ranked second at 35 occurrences. In terms of specific issues which drew condemnation through the catchphrase, 28 were in relation to the political status of Taiwan, while the Tibetan sovereignty debate drew condemnation with the phrase 12 times. A December 2008 Time article used an informal statistical survey to analyse the occurrence of the phrase within People's Daily publications, pointing out that during the period between 1946 and 2006 there were more than one hundred articles that made accusations against a target that had \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\". The Global Times published an analysis in June 2015 which concluded that, based on their query using the keywords \\"hurt\\" () and \\"Chinese people's feelings\\" (), there were 237 articles published by the People's Daily between May 15, 1946 and May 1, 2015 which made accusations of hurt feelings against 29 different countries; among these, 9 targeted India, 16 targeted France, 62 targeted the United States, and 96 targeted Japan. Victor H. Mair wrote in 2011 that while the phrase \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\" resulted in 17,000 online hits, rewriting the phrase as \\"hurt the feelings of the Japanese people\\" only yields 178 hits, and the same phrase rewritten with 17 other nationalities provides zero hits. In addition, use of the keywords \\"bullying\\" () and \\"looking down upon\\" () results in 623,000 Google hits for \\"bullying China\\", and 521,000 hits for \\"looking down upon Chinese people\\". Wang Honglun (), an associate researcher at the Institute of Sociology at Academia Sinica in Taiwan, found that there were 319 instances of \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\" in the People's Daily from 1949 to 2013, based on data obtained from the People's Daily database. Criticism In August 2016, Merriden Varrall, Director of the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, published an opinion piece in The New York Times titled \\"A Chinese Threat to Australian Openness\\" in which she described a trend where many of the 150,000 Chinese international students in Australia introduce pro-China stances into the classroom while attempting to stifle debate that does not match the official viewpoint of China; later in September 2016, another opinion piece by Varrall in The Guardian expressed that while Chinese students in Australia would frequently use the phrase \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\" whenever China received international criticism, such phrasing is only ever used within the context of China, and would never be used by those of other nationalities to condemn criticism of their own countries. A February 2016 piece in The Economist commented that the supposed outrage of the people is often utilised as a tool to allow the Communist Party of China to abandon its official diplomatic principle of non- interference in the internal affairs of other countries, for instance when China releases official statements claiming that the visits of Japanese politicians to Yasukuni Shrine hurt the feelings of the Chinese people. Historical events =United States= Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama have all been accused by Chinese foreign ministry spokespersons and foreign ministers of \\"hurting the feelings of the Chinese people\\" in relation to their respective meetings with the 14th Dalai Lama. =Holy See= On the National Day of the People's Republic of China in 2000, Pope John Paul II canonised 120 missionaries and adherents who died in China during the Qing Dynasty and Republican era; in response, the People's Daily expressed that the move \\"greatly hurt the feelings of the Chinese race and is a serious provocation to the 1.2 billion people of China\\". The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement stating that the Vatican \\"seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and the dignity of the Chinese nation\\". In 2005, the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (the organisation established by the State Administration for Religious Affairs of the State Council of the People's Republic of China to supervise Catholics in China) stated that the attendance of Taiwanese president Chen Shui-bian at Pope John Paul II's funeral \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, including five million Catholics\\". =Europe= In 2000, the Swedish Academy awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature to Gao Xingjian; the People's Daily wrote that the \\"regressive actions\\" had \\"greatly hurt the feelings of the Chinese race, and are a serious provocation to the 1.2 billion people of China\\". On September 24, 2007, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu expressed that German chancellor Angela Merkel's meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and seriously undermined China- Germany relations\\". The 14th Dalai Lama's later meeting with French president Nicolas Sarkozy in December 2008 drew similar criticisms, with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs releasing a press statement insisting that Sarkozy's actions \\"constitute gross interference in China's internal affairs and offend the feelings of the Chinese people\\"; Xinhua News Agency likewise condemned Sarkozy's meeting as \\"not only hurting the feelings of the Chinese people, but also undermining Sino-French relations\\". On October 23, 2008, the European Parliament awarded the 2008 Sakharov Prize to social activist Hu Jia. Prior to the announcement, China had put extensive pressure on the European Parliament to prevent Hu Jia from winning the award, with Chinese Ambassador to the European Union Song Zhe writing a warning letter to the President of the European Parliament stating that should Hu Jia receive the prize, it would seriously damage Sino-European relations and \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\". =Mexico= On September 9, 2011, Mexican president Felipe Calder√≥n met with the 14th Dalai Lama; on the 10th, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu made an official statement stating that China expressed strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to the meeting, and that the meeting \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\". =Japan= On September 15, 2012, after the Japanese government nationalised control over three of the privately owned islands within the Senkaku Islands, the Xinhua News Agency stated that the move \\"hurt the feelings of 1.3 billion Chinese people\\". =Hong Kong= On October 13, 2016, the Government of Hong Kong condemned lawmakers Leung Chung-hang and Yau Wai-ching as having \\"harmed the feelings of our compatriots\\" in a written statement, following allegations that they intentionally pronounced the word \\"China\\" as \\"Chee-na\\", the Cantonese pronunciation of the Japanese ethnic slur Shina, during their swearing-in ceremony; Xinhua News Agency reported that a representative of the Hong Kong Liaison Office made an official statement condemning the act as \\"challenging the nation's dignity and severely hurting the feelings of all Chinese people and overseas Chinese, including Hong Kong compatriots\\". On August 3, 2019, during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, an unknown protester lowered the national flag of China at Tsim Sha Tsui and threw it into the sea; the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office issued a statement condemning \\"extremist radicals who have seriously violated the National Flag Law of the People's Republic of China... flagrantly offending the dignity of the country and the nation, wantonly trampling on the baseline of the one country, two systems principle, and greatly hurting the feelings of all Chinese people\\". =Canada= Following the arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in December 2018, Xinhua News Agency accused Canada of assisting American hegemonic behaviour, an act which \\"hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\". =Australia= On August 26, 2020, China's deputy ambassador to Australia, Wang Xining, expressed that Australia's co-proposal for an independent investigation into the causes of the COVID-19 pandemic \\"hurts the feelings of the Chinese people\\" during his address to the National Press Club of Australia.

(initially titled Salt is Leaving the Sea) is a 2019 drama film written, directed, and produced by Ertanto Robby Soediskam. It stars Maudy Koesnaedi, Chicco Jerikho, Tutie Kirana, Olga Lydia, Joko Anwar, and Nathania Angela. The film revolves around a forbidden intimate relationship between a sister and a pastor, serving a Catholic church. The Indonesian film premiered at the 2018 Hanoi International Film Festival, followed by a screening in the 2018 Hong Kong Asian Film Festival and 2018 Cape Town International Film Market & Festival. Locally, it premiered in the Jogja-NETPAC Asian Film Festival. The film is theatrically released on 11 April 2019. It only received 80,000 audiences in 30 theatres nationwide. Two versions of the films were released: a cut and uncut version. Although it is said that it is an 85-minute film, Ertanto debunks it. The film received positive reviews by critics and audiences; most saluted its powerful Catholic theme, but some pointed out its lack of clarity in terms of the character's backstory.  Plot  In 1998, Maryam, a 40-year-old woman born from a Muslim family, initially worked as a nun in an orphanage. There, she interacted with people from various religions, until one day, when she has to move to Ambarawa, Semarang, in order to work at St. Stanislaus Girisonta Church* * after meeting seven friendly older sisters, deciding to be their assistant. She is introduced as a new member of the church by Pastor Martin to senior nun Sister Monic and monastery manager Mila. Maryam's frequent routine involves showering old sisters, cleaning the environment, and preparing meals. She is helped by Dinda, a Muslim girl, frequently sending milk. One day, the sisters receive the announcement of Martin being replaced with new pastor Yosef, Monic's foster child. Yosef's presence had been predicted by Martin for a long time. Yosef is set to teach orchestra for Maryam and all sisters. Yosef's virtuoso-level of musical ability made Maryam fell in love with her. Monic warns Yosef on Maryam's attitude but failed to persuade. They got even closer together, even when they knew it is forbidden,In Catholicism, sisters and pastors are technically \\"married\\" to Jesus and thus is not allowed to have any romantic relationship. Doing so will result in removal from the Church, in the assumption that they are not suitable. to the point where they ran on the beach naked and touched each other.Only included in the uncut version. She is guilt-ridden, then questions her faith in serving Jesus, and thus left the church upon the sisters' notice. All the sisters try calming her down. She goes to the train station, and hallucinates Yosef, losing her train. On an unknown date, Maryam goes to Girisonta's confessional, confessing her sins; unbeknownst to her, Yosef is the pastor. He has to disguise himself audibly, causing an average interval between talks of 30 seconds. She leaves right after the sisters pass by.  Cast  * Maudy Koesnaedi as Sister Maryam * Chicco Jerikho as Pastor Yosef * Tutie Kirana as Sister Monic * Olga Lydia as Sister Mila * Joko Anwar as Pastor Martin * Nathania Angela as Dinda  Production  The film was initially titled Salt is Leaving the Sea (Indonesian: Garam Meninggalkan Lautnya),The sea is a large body of salt water. before finally changing to Ave Maryam, a mixture of \\"Ave Maria\\" and \\"Maryam.\\" Before starting production, the film's crew mailed out letters of approval to related organizations, including the Semarang diocese, realizing its theme that can be interpreted as sensitive in the Indonesian general public. After being approved, principal photography was implemented for nine days in Semarang and Yogyakarta on 26 November 2018. The film is a noncommercial project, meaning neither of the film team received any expenses from the box office revenue. Ertanto insists that the film will not have any form of follow-ups. The film's poster is revealed in late September 2018, while the sole trailer of the film is revealed the day after. Before starting shooting, Maudy Koesnaedi initially declined the proposal on being part of the film, but is successfully persuaded by Ertanto. Ave Maryam is the first film Maudy participates, in which she is the main character of said film. The consensus to cast Maudy is purely not based on religion; even Ertanto says that he realized that Maudy is Islam after production, motivated by the general public questioning Maudy's religion due to the film. Maudy claims that her character became the general public's misnomer when mentioning her after her role as Zaenab in Si Doel the Movie, that most people thought of Zaenab's cast as \\"Maryam\\" instead of \\"Maudy.\\"  Music  Unlike other films, Ave Maryam's soundtrack is solely a series of vocals in the film with the lyrics hazed by the tone and echoes, sung by jazz singer Aimee Saras. It is titled \\"Sacred Heart,\\" based on the Sacred Heart. Its label is Sendiri Records.  Release  Still using Salt is Leaving the Sea, the film is screened at the 2018 Hanoi International Film Festival. The film also premiered at the 2018 Hong Kong Asian Film Festival, as well as the 2018 Cape Town International Film Market & Festival. It also screened at the 4th Asean International Film Festival & Awards, where it won in the category of Best Editing. Realizing its taboo theme, Ertanto says that he is ready in facing any kind of backlash, before its local release at the Jogja-NETPAC Asian Film Festival on 30 November 2018. Theatrically, it was only screened at 30 theaters on 11 April 2019, its opening day, in correspondence with other films like Bumi Itu Bulat and Sunyi. It was initially planned to be released in February. The film only received 80,000 audiences up to May, with an estimate of 42,044 up to 14 April and 77,000 up to 24 April. Although it was noncommercial and no expenses were made to the film team, it is estimated to be able to produce Rp. 3.2 billion.Calculation is made by multiplying the audience numbers and Cinema XXI's ticket price, Rp. 40,000. Locally, there are two versions distributed by the Indonesian Film Censorship Board (LSF): a cut, 17+ version, and an uncut 21+ version. The 17+ version is used for theatres, while the 21+ version is used during its screening at the Indonesian Film Plaza Festival on 14 November 2019. News reports that the film is 85 minutes long, but Ertanto debunks it, saying that it is 74 minutes long instead. After a year of being lost, the film is released on Netflix on 3 September 2020 using the LSF's cut version; the general public is disappointed with Netflix for choosing the cut version when they will not receive any legal problems if they release the original. The film is rated 16+ on Netflix.  Theme and reception  Maryam at the beach naked, questioning her faith in serving Jesus, able to represent the film's majority of applause for not solely being Catholic, but also being romantic, as love is considered a universal language. Cecylia Rura of Medcom wrote that the Catholic theme the film revolves on is \\"Ertantio's new move in Indonesia's film universe.\\" Ertanto says that he is bored of Indonesian film, who has always been bringing up Muslim themes, in which Indonesia is dominant. Despite its Catholicism, only Olga Lydia (as Mila) is a real-life Catholic among all the casts. Chicco Jerikho (as Yosef) is a Protestant, while Ertanto and Maudy are Muslims. CNN Indonesia calls the film as a new \\"color\\" on Indonesia's film universe due to its taboo mixture of elements. It appreciated the storyline's morals given clearly without sounding lecturing or monotone. Ical Tanjung's cinematography is also praised for capturing Semarang beautifully. The ending is also marked as \\"soul-floating.\\" A writer of Antara wrote that Ave Maryam is not a simple love story, that its romanticism is not visualized by quotable love words, but rather stares, smiles, and tears. Eranto is also said to be successful in telling a story without much dialogue. Publication Jurnal Ruang says that the title itself is familiar in Islam and Christianism, making any thematic criticism unlikely to occur. Criticisms on lack of portrayal of Maryam's backstory and emotions were shown by CNN Indonesia, as well as Tabloid Bintang.

The scientific journal that published the commentary, Nature Ecology and Evolution, selected the topic for the cover of its September issue, with the headline ‚ÄúWelcome to the anthropause‚Äù. The word is a blended lexical item with phonological overlap, combining the prefix anthropo-, from anthropos (Ancient Greek: ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ) meaning ‚Äúhuman‚Äù, and the English word ‚Äúpause‚Äù; its literal translation is ‚Äúhuman pause‚Äù. The researchers explained in their article that they noticed that people had started referring to the lockdown period as the Great Pause, but felt that a more precise term would be helpful. The word anthropause intentionally links to the proposed geological epoch Anthropocene. It is not capitalised as it is conceivable that the anthropause caused by COVID-19 will not remain the only such event. Anthropause is a neologism that is fast entering common language usage, and has been adopted by social media users, scientists, journalists, artists, and photographers, amongst others. William Gibson, the speculative fiction writer who famously coined the term ‚Äúcyberspace‚Äù in his short story ‚ÄúBurning Chrome‚Äù in 1982, posted a tweet on 23 June 2020 simply entitled ‚ÄúThe Anthropause‚Äù, linking to the article that introduced the term. Several global research projects are underway to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 anthropause. For example, a recent study documented a global reduction of high-frequency seismic noise. Another study, the COVID-19 Bio-Logging Initiative, uses animal tracking data collected before, during and after lockdown, to assess how changes in human activity levels affected the movements and behaviour of a wide range of marine, terrestrial and avian species.

It is developed by Arika and published by Nintendo. It was released exclusively on Nintendo Switch as a free download for members of the Nintendo Switch Online service on October 1, 2020 and will remain playable until March 31, 2021. The game was created to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Super Mario Bros.. Critics gave it mostly average reviews, who praised the game's unique concept, combining Super Mario Bros. with battle royale gameplay, but critiqued the game on its repetition and simplicity. Gameplay A classic level from Super Mario Bros. with additional enemies sent by online opponents. In Super Mario Bros. 35, up to 35 players simultaneously play through separate platforming levels from the original Super Mario Bros., collecting coins and defeating enemies, while also trying to survive the longest, with the last player still alive winning the match. There are also limited time events, with the name Special Battle, in which players compete in a set list of courses with set conditions, such as starting with a power-up or with more time on the in-game timer. Instead of a per level time limit as in Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 35 features an overall time limit, with players starting with 35 seconds and earning extra time by defeating enemies and completing levels. Enemies defeated by players are sent to opponents in real-time, appearing in their levels as an additional hindrance to the player. Similar to Tetris 99, players can either manually target their opponents or choose from four types of opponents to attack: players with the most coins collected, players with the least amount of time remaining, players who attack the player themselves, or simply random players. Along with collecting coins as they play through a level, players can earn a bounty of coins if they knock out any opponents during a match. Collecting 20 coins in a match allows players to spin an Item Roulette that gifts players a random power-up such as super mushrooms, invincibility stars, fire flowers, or POW blocks. Outside of matches players also earn coins based on their placing, all which can be used to power-up Mario before starting each match. Players can also practice any level that they have cleared in the main game mode, and review statistics such as averages of their placements, KOs, and defeated enemies, and stats for coins collected, which unlocks after placing first for the first time. Players level up through play, which unlocks icons that they can use to represent themselves on leaderboards. If the holds down the L button in the select screen, and has cleared all levels at least once, the player can play as Luigi. Development The game was developed by Arika, and began development before the release of Arika's previous game, Tetris 99, in February 2019. Super Mario Bros. 35 was announced on September 3, 2020, as part of the Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary. The game released on October 1 for free for Nintendo Switch Online members, and is to be discontinued on March 31, 2021. Following the game's announcement, similarities were made between Super Mario Bros. 35 and Super Mario Royale, an online fan project by InfernoPlus which Nintendo demanded to be removed 1 year prior, as it was infringing Nintendo's copyright. Arika disputed the claim, stating that it was in development before Super Mario Royale.  Reception  Super Mario Bros. 35 received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Chris Button from GameSpot wrote that the game introduced a new competitive twist to the classic version, and Chris Scullion from Nintendo Life wrote that it takes the classic game and \\"dials it to 11\\". Kotakus Ethan Gach appreciated the concept but felt that the \\"novelty doesn't last long\\", and Seth Macy of IGN reiterated this sentiment, noting that \\"the repetition of the early levels in Super Mario Bros. 35 definitely makes it feel less super\\". One week after release, the game received an update fixing minor bugs and internet stability.The game has been compared to the concept of Fortnite. Major complaints from critics focused on the repetition of early levels. Players only start of with level 1-1 unlocked, and unlock more throughout gameplay, causing many players to be forced to play through the beginning levels. Zachary Cuevas from iMore stated that unlocking new levels is unclear, and Chris Carter from Destructoid wrote that not enough players are choosing different levels before a match, which leads to unbalanced repetition. Chris Button from GameSpot observed that the repetition creates a lack of pacing and little intensity, but that Special Battle is a good competitive alternative. Other minor complaints come the final moments of rounds, where it regularly results in two players going through the game under a test of endurance, rather than skill. Shacknews's Ozzie Mejia states how the final two will \\"find themselves in a deadlock after playing the same levels over and over\\", but appreciates how the in game timer will speed up to fit the moment. Ethan Gach from Kotaku thinks the competition revolves around to the standard platforming rather than against other players. Nintendo Life's Chris Scullion believes the game goes back and forth with the final players, until someone eventually wins. Some players have been accused of hacking to obtain 99,999 coins in a single round to gain an easy supply of power-ups, allowing them to top the leaderboards. Nintendo has started to take action by removing videos published online showing gameplay suspected of involving hacking.

Designed to overwhelm the bandwidth of the targeted system. There are two types of DoS attacks: One is designed to crash services and the other is designed to flood services. The most serious attack is distributed. On 3 September 2020, at 2:53 am EDT, a 16-year-old male from South Miami, Florida was arrested in connection with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on the Miami-Dade County Public Schools's computer network, the fourth largest in the US, causing the system to crash during the first three days of the school year. It occurred as the school system was attempting to conduct internet-based instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. After monitoring the IP addresses using the network, investigators concluded the teenager and several foreign actors had hacked the system. At the time, the school district had contracted K12 to provide the software necessary for the internet-based instruction. Despite its price tag of $15.3 million, K12 was surprisingly susceptible to the attacks. Consequently, the school district sought the help of the FBI and U.S. Secret Service to investigate.  Method used in the attacks  According to an affidavit, the suspect used Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) to launch the attacks. LOIC is an application that uses DDoS-style attacks to disrupt websites. However, investigators say the teen was not the only hacker involved. Numerous other IP addresses were associated with the attacks originating from Russia, the Ukraine, China, Iraq, and other countries. Investigators said the suspect was responsible for eight of at least 24 attacks. After the accused admitted to his involvement, he was charged with the crime of using a computer to defraud, a third-degree felony.  Agencies involved in the investigation  The FBI, the US Secret Service, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement are now investigating. US Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida's 26th congressional district formally asked the FBI for a briefing on the issue. US Senator Marco Rubio from Florida has asked the Department of Homeland Security for information about the attacks as well.

The company was bought by Rowntree's in 1972 then later by Nestl√© in 1988. History =Origin= Hoadley's Chocolates had its origins in A. Hoadley and Company, a jam company founded in South Melbourne in 1889 by English businessman Abel Hoadley, which originally manufactured jams but expanded its range to include preserved fruits, candied fruits and peels, and sauces using fruit from Hoadley's orchards at nearby Burwood In 1895, Hoadley opened the Rising Sun Preserving Works in St Kilda Road, and by 1901 had four preserving factories. To overcome the seasonal nature associated with his fruit products, Hoadley diversified and in 1901 or 1902 bought the former factory of Dillon, Burrows & Co. near Princes Bridge, and shifted his company's emphasis more towards confectionery products and commenced the production of cocoa and chocolate. In 1910 Hoadley sold the jam company to Henry Jones Co-operative Ltd., retaining only the confectionery side of the business and the Princes Bridge factory, trading under the name Hoadley & Sons Ltd. Hoadley soon began looking for investors in a new business venture exclusively making chocolates; application for registration of the new company, Hoadley's Chocolates Ltd, was filed in 1913 and the new company was operating by the end of the year. Hoadley retired the same year and passed control of the company to four of his sons: Walter as Managing Director, Peter as Purchasing Officer, Albert as Marketing Officer and Charles as Chairman of Directors (although in reality this was a minor role due to his active personal life outside the family business). Hoadley died in 1918 but the company continued under his sons. Hoadley's Violet Chocolates, c.1947 The company's first product was the Violet Milk Chocolates (later called Hoadley's Chocolate Assortment) named after Hoadley's wife's favourite flower, launched the year the new company was founded. Later that year the company launched the Violet Crumble; Hoadley originally wanted to just call the product 'Crumble' but discovered this would cause problems in obtaining a trademark, and continued his homage to his wife by calling the product the Violet Crumble. =Expansion= Originally, the sale of Hoadley's products was limited to just Victoria (mainly Melbourne). Earliest records for interstate sales appeared in Western Australia in 1921, with advertisements for Violet Crumble by the Perth department store Boans in the lead-up to Christmas. They were sold by the box, for two shillings and sixpence (25 cents) and individual bars became available for sale the following year. In 1923 Hoadley's registered Violet Crumble as a trademark. Advertisements for Violet Crumble later appeared in interstate newspapers, including 'The Advertiser' (Adelaide), with records dating back to at least 1923. In the 1930s the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, but was brought back to profitability mostly through a series of imaginative marketing campaigns by Albert, such as series of collectable cards, many featuring popular Australian an international sporting celebrities of the day, included with various product lines. During the 1940s sales and profits for the company continued to rise and in 1947 the Poly Waffle was launched, which went on to become Hoadley's second most popular product line behind the Violet Crumble. Like the Violet Crumble and Violet Chocolate Assortment before it, the Polly Waffle followed the company's tradition of a mostly purple wrapper. In the post-war years the company continued to operate under Hoadley's sons and more product lines were introduced to the market. Later (possibly in or around 1962) Albert's son Gordon assumed the role of Managing Director and presided over the company until its takeover by Rowntree's in 1972. =New Ownership= After years of financial struggles in the 1960s, Hoadley's Chocolates was bought out by the British chocolate manufacturer Rowntree's in 1972, when it then became known as Rowntree Hoadley Ltd. The new company rationalised its product line and some of the less popular products from the Hoadley's Chocolates era were discontinued. New confectionery items, many non-chocolate, were added to the product range. In 1988 Rowntree Hoadley was acquired by the Swiss conglomerate Nestl√© and the remaining Hoadley's products were then sold originally under the Rowntree Nestl√© brand and later just as Nestl√©. In 2018 Nestl√© sold the rights to the Violet Crumble to South Australian confectioner Robert Menz. In 2019 Menz also bought the rights to the Polly Waffle from Nestl√©, which the company had discontinued in 2009. Production is expected to recommence in 2021. Products =Confectionery= Advertisement for Hoadley's chocolates, 1957 Hoadley's products prior to the company's takeover by Rowntree's included * 5 Star Bubble Gum: discontinued, date unknown. * Arctic Mints: green and white peppermint-flavoured candy balls with a milk chocolate centre packaged in a cardboard can. Discontinued, date unknown. * Bertie Beetle: introduced in 1963, still in production (now made in New Zealand). * Clancy Bar: wafers with a jam centre coated in dark chocolate. The bar took its name from the poem Clancy of the Overflow and Hoadley's promoted the product through sponsored readings of the poem on various radio stations around the country. Believed to have been first produced in the 1950s (possibly 1956) it is now discontinued, date unknown. * Crumblettes: bite- sized pieces of Violet Crumble packaged in a rectangular box. Discontinued, date unknown. * Lady Beetle: a white chocolate version of Bertie Beetle, possibly with caramel pieces rather than honeycomb. It was only available in showbags but is now discontinued, date unknown. * Luncheon: a wafer bar filled with caramel cream and peanuts coated in milk chocolate. Discontinued, date unknown. * Polly Waffle: introduced in 1947, discontinued in 2009.

The original theme was a pale purple colour featuring a wave-like sculptured lid and a gold ribbon embedded with violets on its upper left. Later designs included a rose theme (available in multiple colours) and an Oriental theme which was marketed as 'Pagoda Chocolates'. These boxes are now sought after by collectors and may be found at auctions and auction sites. =Collectable Cards= During the 1930s and 1940s a number of Hoadley's products came with collectable cards. Collection series included: * Empire Games and Test Teams (cricket) * Victorian Football League players. * Victorian football \\"action\\" series * the Wild West Depending on the series and year of printing, sets had between 50 and 100 cards. These cards are now sought after by collectors and may be found at auctions, auction sites and trading card dealers. =Radio Broadcasts= In 1956 to promote their new Clancy Bar, Hoadley's Chocolates commissioned the reading of the Banjo Paterson poem Clancy of the Overflow (from which the chocolate bar was named) across a number of radio stations across the country (possibly in the evenings of Monday 20th to Wednesday 22 August). Radio stations that participated in this event included: * 2HD Newcastle * 2KA Katoomba * 2UW Sydney * 3UZ Melbourne * 4BC Brisbane * 4SB Kingaroy * 5AU Port Augusta * 5KA Adelaide * 5RM Renmark * 6PM-AM Perth * 7HO Hobart * 7LA Launceston =Showbags= As well as being sold in shops, Hoadley's products wee also available in showbags at annual Australian shows such as Brisbane's Ekka and Sydney's Royal Easter Show. These included: * Bertie Beetle showbag: following the success of the introduction of the Bertie Beetle the product gained its own showbag in 1965, mostly containing a number of Bertie Beetle chocolates and was traditionally the cheapest showbag on sale at the shows. * Hoadley's Chocolate showbag (later the Violet Crumble showbag): contained an assortment of Hoadley's products including one or more Polly Waffles, Violet Crumbles and White Knights. When Hoadley's first began producing Bertie Beetle in 1963, it first appeared in this showbag at the Sydney Royal Easter Show of that year. * Lady Beetle showbag: following the success of the Bertie Beetle showbag, a similar bag featuring the Lady Beetle (a white chocolate version of Bertie Beetle) was launched in the 1970s. It did not prove as successful and was later withdrawn from sale, possibly before the Nestl√© takeover. The contents of these showbags varied over the years. =Sponsorships= In 1966 Hoadley's Chocolates began sponsoring Australia's Battle of the Sounds, an annual contest for unsigned music bands which began the previous year. Hoadley's sponsorship of the contest continued until the company's buy-out by Rowntree's in 1972. For more information, refer Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds Factory Locations Hoadley's factory near Princes Bridge, South Melbourne c.1900 Hoadley's Chocolates had factories and other major premises in the following cities: *Melbourne: Hoadley's original confectionery factory was the former premises of Dillon Burrows & Co. located om the south bank of the Yarra River near Princes Bridge, to the west of St Kilda Road. The factory was demolished around 1983 for the construction of Southbank, with production transferred to the Rowntree Hoadley factory at Campbellfield in the northern suburbs, which was extended in 1977 to cater for increased product lines. The factory is still in operation under Nestl√©'s ownership. *Adelaide: in the post-war years (exact date unknown) Hoadley's opened a large factory in Carrington Street (on or near the corner of Surflen Street) in Adelaide and transferred production of the Violet Crumble from their South Melbourne factory. Following Rowntree's buy-out in 1972 this factory was extensively utilised for Rowntree-Hoadley's expanded product line, especially for many non-chocolate products. In the 1980s production at this factory began scaling back as the company consolidated operations in Melbourne, which lead to large- scale workforce redundancies. By the time of the Nestl√© takeover in 1988, all operations had ceased and the plant had closed. While Nestl√© still maintains a manufacturing presence in Adelaide, it is not in the same premises. *Sydney: a large factory and distribution centre was constructed at Rosebery in South Sydney in the post-war years. Following Rowntree's buy-out in 1972, production was subsequently scaled back and transferred to Rowntree-Hoadley factories in other cities, eventually leaving only the distribution centre before all operations ceased in the late 1970s. In 1981, the derelict premises were destroyed in a major fire. Another factory existing in Annandale in Sydney's inner west, opened c1962 by the company's managing Director Gordon Hoadley. It is believed to have closed in the 1970s when operations were consolidated after the company was bought out by Rowntree's and production transferred to Melbourne. Later Issues =Consumer Backlash= Following Nestl√©'s takeover of Rowntree Hoadley Ltd in 1988, many of the original Hoadley's products were subsequently withdrawn from sale creating backlash from the Australian public. Campaigns were often started by consumer groups pressuring Nestle to re-introduce the discontinued products. In the early-mid 2000s, Nestl√© withdrew the Bertie Beetle Showbag from sale at annual shows, citing production costs as the product was now manufactured in New Zealand and shipped to Australia. A public campaign was started pressuring Nestl√© to bring back the showbag, which was a crowd favourite. In 2007 Nestl√© relented and the showbag was again available, first reappearing in that year's Sydney Royal Easter Show. In 2006 the price of the showbag, traditionally $2, was raised to $3, resulting in public backlash. In 2007 the showbag returned to its previous price and has remained at $2 since. Polly Waffle, late Nestl√© era In mid-2009, Nestl√© introduced a new recipe for the Polly Waffle along with new packaging. The new product was the same appearance as the older one, but contained a more sugary and brittle wafer and was not popular with the buying public. After 62 years production Nestl√© discontinued the Polly Waffle on 23 November 2009 citing poor sales. In 2019 Nestl√© signed a deal with the South Australian confectioner Robert Menz (who previously bought the rights to Violet Crumble from Nestl√© in 2018) for production to resume at that company's factory in Adelaide, partly financed with federal government funding. Production is slated to recommence in 2021. In 2010 Nestl√© discontinued production of \\"fun size\\" packets of Violet Crumble citing production costs. Despite calls from the public to re-introduce these bags, Nestl√© refused. In 2019, after the rights to the product were purchased by and production was transferred to Robern Menz, the bags reappeared in supermarkets. In 2020 the company launched new flavours, including caramel. In 2014 Nestl√© signed a deal that resulted in White Knight bars only being available from the major supermarkets Coles and Woolworths, along with a few small confectionery shops. Previously sold at a lower price reflecting the bar's smaller size (25g), the two supermarkets soon raised the product's price to match that of larger chocolate bars (typically weighing 50g-80g). In spite of public complaints, Nestl√© refused to intervene (nor make the product available for sale through other retailers) and sales subsequently fell. In 2016, Nestl√© discontinued production of the White Knight, citing poor sales. =Production Stoppages= At the peak of its operations the company was the biggest customer in Victoria for sugar produced by CSR, the Colonial Sugar Refining company. In 1988 Rowntree Hoadley temporarily ceased production after running out of sugar after a strike by CSR workers, and stood down around 700 members of its workforce. =Rosebery Fire= On the afternoon of 3 October 1981 a major fire broke out at the Rowntree-Hoadley factory in Rosebery, Sydney. The factory, which had already ceased operations and demolition work begun, was completely destroyed by the blaze, which was not extinguished until the following morning.

It was released on 21 May 2020 as the lead single from their fourth studio album Between You and Me (2020). Background and release In a press release, lead guitarist Jordi Davieson discussed the song's origins, stating: > \\"When do you pull the plug? How do you know if the juice is worth the > squeeze? Do you pick up the pieces and move onto something new? Or stick it > out for another round of romance? The game of love is never an easy one to > play. Like many of the songs from our forthcoming record, \\"On the Line\\" has > been through many different stages. It almost didn't make it on the record. > It wasn't until we revisited it at home from a different angle that > everything fell into place and it turned into a gem. We all connect deeply > with this song and its sentiment and we think others will too.\\" Composition and lyrics Musically, \\"On the Line\\" has been described as a pop and dream pop song. Self-described as a \\"lament disguised as a pop song\\", the track discusses \\"the eternal conundrum of whether a love is worth pursuing\\" and explores \\"the fragility of a weak relationship\\". Live performances San Cisco performed the track on Australian live music program The Sound on 28 July 2020. Critical reception Al Newstead of Triple J described the track as having \\"that classic San Cisco flair\\", further noting, \\"[it has] the contrast of dour lyrics and shiny music that made \\"Awkward\\" and \\"Too Much Time Together\\" so memorable.\\" Tyler Jenke of Rolling Stone Australia noted \\"[it's] one of those songs which hides a far more serious manner than its cheery fa√ßade might indicate.\\" Alex Gallagher of Music Feeds described the track as \\"warm and jubilant\\". Elli Chappelhow of Gigwise thought that San Cisco have \\"mastered the knack of using earworm tracks and pop hooks to really evoke a mood and feeling\\", adding that it \\"[fuses] bright and boppy instrumentals\\". Thomas Bleach felt the song was \\"positive and uplifting\\" in stark contrast to the lyrical content, and called the guitar riffs \\"festival ready\\". Music video The music video was directed by Brendan Hutchens and was premiered on Triple J on 21 May 2020, alongside the song's release. According to Davieson, filming the music video was the first time the band had been together in months. He stated: > \\"It was such a fun day of filming with a great crew. We were super excited > to be able to come out of isolation and join together as a band for the > first time in months to shoot this video. We appreciate that at the moment > not everyone is as lucky as us here in Western Australia [due to reimposed > COVID-19 gathering restrictions], to be able to come together in this way. > We really hope that those who can't will be able to reconnect with loved > ones safely soon.\\" =Synopsis= The video depicts the band practicing together, reuniting after COVID-19 gathering restrictions eased in Western Australia. =Reception= Al Newstead of Triple J and Alex Gallagher of Music Feeds described the music video as \\"cute\\" and \\"very wholesome\\", respectively. The West Australian's Stephanie McKenna felt the video \\"marks a welcome departure from the face masks, jigsaws and sourdough bread baking that have become hallmarks of the past months.

The original name of this platform was Schweizerischen Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Spanienkinder (SAS), in German, and Comit√© neutro de Secours aux Enfants de Espagne, in French.Volunteers of the Swiss Aid pose with a supply truck in Spain in 1937 (Rodolfo Olgiati appears first on the right).  Creation  The Swiss Aid Committee was created in February 1937 at the initiative of Rodolfo Olgiati, secretary of the pacifist organization Service Civil Internacional (SCI), who promoted a plan to act in Spain and bring together the maximum number of Swiss entities to contribute to humanitarian aid, with the go-ahead from the Swiss federal government, which had initially been reluctant due to a strict interpretation of neutrality. In fact, SCI was very important inside the committee and contributed with the largest number of volunteers to the ground (around thirty volunteers throughout the entire war, mostly Swiss). Olgiati was also the secretary of the committee.  Mission  The main beneficiaries of the aid were children and other vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and pregnant and lactating women. Children's evacuation by Swiss Aid in 1937 in Spain. From the initial idea, the Swiss Aid was open to work with both side in conflict but, in the practice, they almost always acted in the Republican faction zone, because in general the Nationalist faction rejected the aid. There were local Swiss Aid groups located in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Murcia. The main tasks of the volunteers were: manage canteens; evacuate children from war zones to safe places; send to children's colonies, shelters and hospitals basic necessities from donations; and logistical support to children's colonies, shelters and hospitals through direct assistance and sponsorship. They worked together with republican institutions and local entities who received refugee children and families. Swiss Aid volunteers also collaborated with the Quakers on many of the missions. SCI members who participated in the Swiss Aid were: Elisabeth Eidenbenz, Ruth von Wild, Karl Ketterer, Irma Schneider, Ralph Hegnauer, Trudi Ketterer, Maurice Dubois, Elsbeth Kasser, Willy Begert and Eleonore Imbelli, among others.  End and evolution  In January 1939, most of the Swiss Aid volunteers left Spain. In a few months, they reorganized in the south of France to assist the thousands of refugees interned in camps and to retrieve children from sponsored colonies who had been evacuated to France. In this context, they founded children's colonies and maternity wards, such as the famous Elna Maternity, and served various internment camps. In 1940, the Swiss Aid adapted to the new situation created by the outbreak of the Second World War so it was refounded with the name of Swiss Cartel for Relief to Children Victims of War, originally in German: Schweizerischen Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr kriegsgesch√§digte Kinder (SAK). It remained a neutral NGO platform, led by the SCI, which extended their action to all refugee children from war zones, because more children started arriving from the north of France due the II Word War. From 1942, the platform was transferred to the Swiss Red Cross, which extended their humanitarian action throughout France, using aid systems that had already been used during the Spanish Civil War.

In another dream, she saw a serpent which proceeded to coil would her. Shortly after this, she was impregnated with Li Xiong.

Early years He was born in Shirley, Massachusetts, the son of Jonathan Atherton and Rhoda Heald. The youngest of six children. His father died when he was 6 months old. He was admitted in 1808, at just five years of age, along with his sister, Sylvia, into the Harvard Shakers. His other sister Nancy was sent to another Shaker community. thumb Life as a Shaker The Shaker community in Harvard, Massachusetts began when a group of dissenters from the local state-funded church, left and set up the \\"Square House\\", having affiliated themselves with Mother Ann Lee, the founder of the Shaker denomination, when she visited Harvard, Massachusetts. After 1821, there was no one single leader, but rather a small nucleus of ministry elders and eldresses with authority over all the Shaker villages, each with their own teams of elders and eldresses who were subordinate to the Ministry. Harvard Shaker Village Atherton would have been referred to within this community as ‚ÄúBrother Simon Atherton‚Äù. However he was elevated to a ministry level, as ‚ÄúElder Atherton‚Äù, a trusted leader within the community. Trustee of the Shaker Society He served as trustee in the community in Harvard for over 50 years from 1838 to 1888. He borrowed the saying: and used it as his motto for the communities herb industry, which is quoted, even today, on the Shaker Workshops page. thumb Dealer in Medicinal Herbs Atherton was a dealer in medicinal herbs for the Shaker Society. The Shaker day journals during his era recorded his efforts ‚ÄúSimon goes to Boston.‚Äù By 1835 the herb industry in Harvard was a major business. In order to support demand, the Harvard Shakers constructed a Herb Drying House in 1848 and a Herb Barn in 1849. thumb Efficient production, drying, and marketing of high-quality herbs resulted in worldwide sales of over 18 tons in 1855. Atherton is credited with building up their seed business. Membership of the community was vital to such expansion and during Atherton‚Äôs time in this community membership went on to peak at 200 in the 1850s. Atherton had become a renowned Shaker businessman who promoted his community to outsiders, with his medicinal herbs whilst in Boston, and would spend at least two days a week at the Massachusetts State House representing the Shaker‚Äôs business interests. He lodged at Boston‚Äôs Quincy House for many years and was regarded as a regular boarder. thumb Personal His sister, Sylvia Atherton (1801-1866) lived in the same Shaker community in Harvard. However, his elder sister, Nancy Atherton (1797-1873) was admitted to the shaker community in Shirley, where became a seamstress, and is buried in the Shirley Shaker Cemetery. Death Atherton died on October 7, 1888, at the age of 85. He is buried at the Shaker Burying Ground in Harvard. Legacy He is listed in the A-Z of Shakers as a ‚Äúnotable shaker‚Äù. , along with Tabitha Babbitt, Grove Blanchard, Elijah Myrick, William Leonard, Augustus Grosvenor, Roxalana Grosvenor, Olive Hatch, Hannah Kendal and Annie Walker. Ancestry He was the third generation of Atherton‚Äôs to have resided in Shirley, Massachusetts, His grandfather Amos married Lydia Gould of Shirley in 1758. Prior to that his paternal ancestors had resided in Lancaster, Massachusetts having been pioneer settlers to the area. He is a direct descendant of James Atherton, who arrived in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in the 1630s. The Atherton family ancestry originated from Lancashire, England.

The discussion around it started during the COVID-19 pandemic. The idea has been questioned by the medical and catering industry for being unscientific and has been criticized by human rights organizations for being virtually a social credit system. However multiple pro-establishment parties have expressed their support for the proposal.  History and Developments  In May 2020, Dr. Pak-Leung Ho, the director of the Centre of Influenza Research of the University of Hong Kong, suggested that the Guangdong‚ÄëHong Kong‚ÄëMacau Area was ready for a more lenient border control policy. He also suggested that the Hong Kong government could introduce a ‚Äúhealth code‚Äù policy to replace the existing quarantine procedure, which was already implemented in Macau and part of Mainland China. The proposed health code mobile app would include the users‚Äô nucleic acid test results so that travelers would not have to present hard copies of their test results. On 11 June 2020, the Hong Kong government disclosed that it would soon announce the details of a mutual recognition system for health codes of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao, intending to restore the traffic between the three regions. It also stated that the government of the three regions were discussing the details and had nearly come to an agreement, and that the details may be announced in as soon as a week if the epidemic remains stable. However, the announcement of the scheme was later postponed, reportedly to 27 June or 28 June. It was also reported that the scheme may be adjusted to be initially between Hong Kong and Guangdong only, and that Macau would only be included in the scheme at a later stage if the scheme is successful. However, the policy was further postponed to August as the epidemic in Hong Kong deteriorated in July. At a press conference held on 21 August, the Chief Executive Carrie Lam stated that the health code policy will be implemented after the epidemic in Hong Kong stabilizes, but its usage will be limited to border control only and will be without any tracking functions. It was suggested by some pro-establishment parties that all citizens should be required to show their health codes before entering a restaurant, to which Carrie Lam has criticized for being impractical.  Reactions  = Pro-establishment parties = On 9 August 2020, multiple pro-establishment parties including the DAB, the BPA, the HKFTU, and the NPP held a joint press conference and urged the government to implement a mutual recognition system for health codes in the Greater Bay Area. The BPA further suggested that citizens without a health code should be prohibited from entering public spaces such as restaurants or malls. = Medical Industry = The pulmonologist Dr. Chi-Chiu Leung commented that the health code policy ‚Äúlacks any scientific evidence‚Äù as an epidemic preventive measure, since there was no successful precedent and that it was contrary to epidemiological analysis. As the COVID-2019 has a quite fluid incubation period, citizens may test negative falsely and as a result travel to multiple locations before any symptoms appear, effectively becoming a superspreader. Thus the health code policy may actually impair the effort against the epidemic. He also opined that in order for the society to resume normal activities, the government should instead focus on controlling this wave of the epidemic while preventing more imported cases. The President of the Hong Kong Medical Association Dr. Kin Choi stated that the users must be tested at least weekly in order for the health code policy to be effective, as otherwise it cannot be guaranteed that the users are truly negative for COVID-19. He further pointed out that without proper support, the health code scheme will just be \\"an activity exclusive to the wealthy\\" . Ivan Law, the vice- chairperson of the HA Employees Alliance, pointed out that an app that allows the government to record every place a citizen has been will be controversial, even in a democratic society . Winnie Yu, the chairperson of the HA Employee Alliance, criticized the government for allowing certain categories of travelers to be exempted from quarantine after entering Hong Kong. As long as the government refuses to completely shut down the border, it is impossible to quench the epidemic from its source. She further pointed out that the social gathering ban and the health code scheme were not epidemic prevention policies, but were in truth political agendas to restrict the citizen's freedom . = Catering Industry = Gordon Lam, convenor at the Hong Kong Small and Medium Restaurant Federation, criticized the government for having its head in the clouds. Gordon pointed out that if a customer was falsely convinced by his/her health code that he/she was free of the virus, it could lead to a new wave of the epidemic. He alternatively suggested that closing the border was the best measure to combat the epidemic. = Information Technology Industry = Wong Ho-wa, an Election Committee member representing the IT industry, once expressed his concern that the health code policy will over-collect personal data. There were multiple doubts regarding the policy that the Hong Kong government has not yet cleared up, including the question of how the governments of Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong will utilize the data, and if there will be a data retention period. There was also the concern that citizen's data would lose the protection by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance as the data will be transferred to Mainland China. Alex Tang, the chairperson of the Hong Kong Information Technology Workers‚Äô Union, pointed out that the health code scheme will effectively force Hong Kong citizens to transfer their personal data to Mainland China . = Human rights organizations = The director of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor Law Yuk Kai pointed out that if the health code policy is implemented in Hong Kong, it will allow the government to classify citizens into different categories and limit some of them from using certain governmental services, effectively implementing a social credit system similar to that in Mainland China.

It was established under the Multi-state co-operative societies act 1984 under the former Ministry of Welfare. Later it came under the control of Ministry of Tribal affairs.In order to empower the downtrodden tribal community it started the procurement of tribal art and craft items firstly in 1999 through its retail outlet called TRIBES INDIA. Mandate thumbFormer Minister for Tribal Affairs Jual Oram launching the TAM Squash ‚Äì a non-alcoholic drink, developed by the TRIFED & IIT-Delhi. The Tribal Co-operative Marketing Federation of India (TRIFED) was formed with the main objective of institutionalising the trade of Minor forest products(MFP) and to provide the tribals of India a fair price for the surplus agricultural products produced by them. It was established in 1987 and became operational in 1988. It also fulfills other objectives as per its mandate as for example it ensures the sustainable harvesting of MFP. It also saves the tribals from the policies of middleman, who buy the MFP from them at cheap rates while providing it to the end users at higher rates. In case of fluctuations in the price of these MFPs, the mandate of TRIFED is to provide adequate compensation to the tribals through Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare. It also provides information to the tribals about the fair price of their products and enables them to bargain for it. In order to support tribal art and craft it organises the tribal art and craft exhibition called \\"Aadi Mahotsav\\"; where tribal craft products from all over the country are exhibited and bought by the art lovers. Initiatives Former Minister of Tribal Affairs, Shri P.R. Kyndiah launching the ‚ÄòVindhya Herbals' herbal products by TRIFED, in New Delhi on 18 May 2008. =Van Dhan Yojna= Van Dhan Yojna was launched on 14 April 2018, initially as a pilot project in Bijapur; Chhattisgarh under which a Van Dhan Vikas Kendra was set up to cater ten Self Help Groups of thirty tribal gatherers each. Out of the total cost of twenty five lakhs which was spent to set it up 25% was met by state government. However; as per \\"TRIFED\\" each such Kendra will constitute 15 tribal Self Help Groups with 20 gatherers each making total number of beneficiary per Kendra to be 300. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs with technical support from the TRIFED aimed to set up 30,000 such centres in the country with the basic motive of skill upgradation and capacity building of tribal gatherers as well as ensure marketability of their raw products by setting up primary processing and value addition facilities. As of June 2020, 1205 tribal enterprises employing 360,000 people through 18000 Self Help Group were established in the country. The scheme created some of the important success stories like that of Nagaland's Langleng district, where tribals used to sell their unique hill broom grass for just ‚Çπ7 per kg. But after being trained through the \\"Van Dhan Kendra\\" under Van Dhan Yojna, they managed to earn ‚Çπ60 per broom which enhanced their income. The perishable nature of Non timber forest products made it difficult for tribal gatherers to make profit out of it, further the poor marketing infrastructure in tribal areas also made it difficult for them to have direct market access for their products. Considering these challenges the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and TRIFED launched the MSP for MFP scheme in 2013‚Äì14. In May 2020 the revised guidelines on the scheme were launched amidst COVID-19 crisis and 23 more Non-Timber forest products were added to the list of MFP to be procured by State implementing agency (SIA). In the backdrop of \\"Van Dhan Yojna\\"; TRIFED along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and Ministry of Food Processing Industries launched the TRIFOOD project in August 2020. The scheme envisaged setting up of tertiary value addition units at Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh and Raigad in Maharashtra for value addition of forest products in a bid to enhance the income of the tribals of catchment area. =Van Dhan Samajik Doori Jagrookta Abhiyaan= Amidst the COVID-19 crisis in 2020 TRIFED, launched this scheme in order to educate the tribals in COVID related safety measures.Nationwide and state specific webinars were organised in order to bring awareness on the issue. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs also revised Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Minor forest products (MFP) to be procured from the tribals under MSP for MFP scheme meanwhile promoting door to door procurement and sale through mobile vans. The program was launched in association with UNICEF. =Tech for Tribals scheme= TRIFED with the support from Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises launched the \\"Tech for Tribal\\" scheme in March 2020. It aims to impart the training to tribal forest product gatherers through a 30 day course developed by the higher educational institutions like IITs. The partner institutions will develop courses relevant to entrepreneurship in value addition and processing of Minor forest products. The scheme will empower the tribal entrepreneurs to run their business with marketable products having quality certification.

As these employ ratings, each voter rates the different candidates on an ordered, numerical or verbal scale. The various highest median rules differ in their treatment of ties, i.e., the method of ranking the candidates with the same median rating. Proponents of highest median rules argue that they faithfully reflect the voter's opinion, that they satisfy the independence of irrelevant alternatives and do not fall within the scope of Arrow's impossibility theorem. Critics point out that highest median rules violate the Condorcet criterion: a candidate can in principle be elected even if all voters but one prefer another candidate.Brams, S. and R. Potthoff (2015) \\"The paradox of grading systems\\" http://www.politics.as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/2578/GradingParadox.pdfFelsenthal, Dan S. and Machover, Mosh√©, ¬´ The Majority Judgement voting procedure: a critical evaluation ¬ª, Homo oeconomicus, vol 25(3/4), (2008) http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.324.1143&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf  Definition and Notations  Let \\\\mathcal{C} be the set of candidates, \\\\mathcal V the set of voters, and \\\\mathcal G an ordered finite set of ratings (e.g. the following ratings: \\"Very good\\", \\"Good\\", \\"Average\\", \\"Bad\\"). For any candidate c \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C}, c's median rating \\\\alpha _c \\\\in \\\\mathcal G is the median rating among the ratings that c received from voters. For example, if there are ten voters and if candidate A receives three ratings \\"Good\\", six ratings \\"Average\\", and one rating \\"Bad\\", its median rating \\\\alpha _A is \\"Average\\". If, for any candidate i eq c, \\\\alpha _i < \\\\alpha _c, then c obtained a higher median rating than all other candidates, and c is elected, regardless of which highest median rule was chosen. When different candidates share the same median rating, a tie-breaking rule is required. This tie- breaking rule characterizes the highest median rule at use. Tie-breaking rules often make use of two additional statistics about a candidate c's ratings: * The share of proponents to c, noted p_c, which is the share of voters attributing to c a rating greater than its median \\\\alpha _c. In the example above, the three ratings \\"Good\\" are above A's median \\"Average\\", so p_A=\\\\frac{3}{10}. * The share of opponents to c, noted q_c, which is the share of voters attributing to c a rating lesser than its median \\\\alpha _c. In the example above, this correspond to the rating \\"Bad\\", so q_A=\\\\frac{1}{10}.  Examples  Example of vote outcome where each choice (or candidate) A, B, C or D wins according to one of the four tie-breaking rule studied: respectively typical judgment (d), usual judgment (s), central judgment (n), and majority judgment (mj). * The typical judgment orders the candidates according to the largest difference between their share of proponents and opponents, i.e. according to the formula: d=\\\\alpha + p - q (the indices c are omitted for simplicity). In the above example, and identifying \\"Average\\" with the grade 0, we have d_A=0+0.3-0.1=+0.2. * The usual judgment is the rule said to offer the best properties, but it orders the candidates according to a slightly more complex formula: n = \\\\alpha + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{p-q}{1-p-q}. * The central judgment orders the candidates according to the highest ratio between the shares of proponents and opponents, that is to say according to the formula: s = \\\\alpha + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{p-q}{p+q+\\\\epsilon} (where \\\\epsilon is an arbitrarily small number that simply allows the denominator to remain positive). * The majority judgment considers the candidate who is closest to having a rating other than its median and breaks the tie based on that rating. This is equivalent to ordering the candidates according to their score mj, defined by the following formula (the symbol \\\\mathbf{1} denotes the indicator function) : mj = \\\\alpha + \\\\mathbf{1}_{p>q}p - \\\\mathbf{1}_{p \\\\leq q}q . * The Bucklin rules are close to the highest median rules but have been developed for ranked rules. They order the candidates according to the formula: b=\\\\alpha - q. In a ranked rule, this is equivalent to counting first choice votes first. If one candidate has a majority, that candidate wins. Otherwise the second choices are added to the first choices. If a candidate with a majority vote is found, the winner is the candidate with the most votes accumulated. Lower rankings are added as needed.Collective decisions and voting: the potential for public choice, Nicolaus Tideman, 2006, p. 204 * Approval voting corresponds to the degenerate case where there are only two possible rating: approval and disapproval. In this particular case, all the tie-breaking rules are equivalent, and the Condorcet criterion is satisfied.

Domingo is allegedly very close to Matteo Messina Denaro.  History  Francesco Domingo assumed the leadership of the Castellammare del Golfo Mafia family in the 1990s, which in the meantime was decimated by numerous arrests, Domingo in turn was arrested in November 2001, accused of Mafia association. Francesco Domingo was then again tried and sentenced to over nineteen years of imprisonment for leading the Castellammare's mafia, in the process that resulted from the operation known as Tempesta, Domingo's nickname in the underworld. According to the investigators, the boss, even during his detention, had maintained the regency of the mafia family, directly managing the extortion to companies from the prison and receiving the proceeds to be poured into the \\"cash\\" of the association, and this through collaboration of his wife Antonella Di Graziano. Released from prison in 2016, Francesco Domingo was subjected to the preventive measure of the special public security surveillance with the obligation to stay in the Municipality of Castellammare. Domingo has a particular inclination to violence, which has always characterized his conduct in the organization. It is precisely because of these characteristics and the extremely dangerous criminal profile of the boss that, at the time of his release, the investigative activity against him was started, appearing highly likely that Domingo, returned to freedom, would again acquire control of the mafia family. The Castellammare family was dedicated to the control of economic activities through intimidation and extortion against building and agricultural entrepreneurs. Domingo was also the contact person for the resolution of disputes within the clan. According to various investigations, the boss has maintained close relations with the branches of the Cosa Nostra in the United States, in particular with the Bonannos, in fact, the affiliates of the New York family made numerous visits to Domingo's villa, in the Gagliardetta district. And they would also ask Domingo for authorization to speak with other exponents of the Alcamo's mandamento, as well as conveyed messages between Domingo and his associates in the United States.

Michael Alfred Raymond Trotobas (20 May 1914 ‚Äì 27 November 1943), code named Sylvestre and known in France as Capitaine Michel, was an agent of the United Kingdom's clandestine Special Operations Executive (SOE) organization during World War II in France. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Trotobas's first mission to France in September 1941 ended with him being arrested by Vichy police and imprisoned for several months until he and other SOE agents contrived to escape in July 1942. On his second mission from November 1942 until November 1943, he created, organised, and led the Farmer network (or circuit), sometimes called the Sylvestre-Farmer network, based in Lille. He led many successful sabotage operations before being betrayed by a member of his network and killed in a gun battle with the German military police. Typically, SOE agents worked with local resistance leaders, assisting and influencing them but not directly commanding resistance groups and fighters. However, \\"Capitaine Michel\\" was both the creator and the commander of the Farmer network, \\"an accomplished organiser, an audacious saboteur, and an inspirational leader.\\" He headed a \\"powerful circuit of more than 800 resisters of the German occupation, with an escape line, an intelligence gathering service, and numerous parachute reception grounds.\\" Early life Trotobas was born 20 May 1914 in Brighton, England the son of Henri Trotobas, originally from the Provence region of France, and Agnes Whelan from near Dublin, Ireland. He grew up in near poverty. In 1933, he joined the Middlesex Regiment. He became a weapons instructor, a good swimmer, and the regiment's light heavyweight boxing champion. In 1939 he and his regiment were sent to France at the beginning of World War II. He commanded a platoon as a Platoon sergeant major and was wounded during the Dunkirk Evacuation in 1940. Commended for bravery, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on 10 January 1941. Special Operations Executive Trotobas came to the attention of SOE because of his ability to speak French and on 2 April 1941 became a member of the organization. During his training he was generally praised by his instructors; his \\"guts and determination,\\" leadership qualities, and military experience were cited, although he was also considered \\"impetuous\\" and impatient. At the completion of his training he was promoted to captain. =First mission= Trotobas parachuted into France on the night of 6/7 September 1941 as part of a group of six SOE agents who scattered after landing near Tendu in Indre Department. At this early stage in the history of SOE, his primary task was exploratory, looking for opportunities to create, organize, and supply with arms and equipment the fledgling French Resistance. The Vichy police, however, had become aware of the SOE agents infiltrating their territory and, captured a dozen agents, nearly all the agents present in Vichy (unoccupied) France. Trotobas was arrested on 27 October in Chateauroux. Prison and escape Trotobas and the other SOE agents were first imprisoned in poor conditions in P√©rigueux, but in March 1942, thanks to the intervention of the American consulate, they were transferred to an internment camp of 2,000 internees near Mauzac-et-Grand-Castang in the Dordogne region of southern France where conditions were much better. The SOE agents began planning an escape, assisted on the outside by SOE agent Virginia Hall and Gaby Bloch, wife of the prisoner Jean-Pierre Bloch. Trotobas's role in planning the escape was to lead the SOE agents in daily exercise sessions to get them physically fit for the challenges they would face after the escape. On 15 July 1942, eleven SOE agents escaped the prison. Trotobas led the way, carrying a strip of carpet to lay down on the ground and trailing a ball of string behind him for signaling‚Äî-one twitch for okay, three for danger to the prisoners who followed him, one by one. He unfastened the lower strands of the double barbed-wire fence to permit the prisoners to crawl under. At one point a French guard came within of Trotobas, who was prepared to kill the guard if necessary. Instead the guard asked who was escaping and when told that it was the English agents, told Trotobas not to make so much noise and walked away. All eleven SOE agents escaped and, after hiding in the woods while an intense manhunt took place, made their way in small groups to meet up with Hall in Lyon by 11 August. From there, they were smuggled to Spain and Portugal and thence back to England.Purnell, Sonia (2019), A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II, New York: Viking, , pp. 113-126 The official historian of SOE, M. R. D. Foot, called the escape \\"one of the war's most useful operations of its kind.\\" Several of the escapees returned later to France and become leaders of SOE networks.. First published in 1966. =Second mission= Trotobas arrived in London on September 17, 1942. On the night of 17/18 November he was back in France, landing by parachute near the town of Montargis, south of Paris. Landing with him was his wireless operator, Arthur Staggs. The two men were to set up the Farmer Circuit in Lille. Anti- German feeling ran high in Lille, which remembered the German occupation of World War I. Lille was an industrial center with communist-led trade unions dedicated in their resistance to the Germans after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Lille was also important in German defenses for the coast of northern France, including air bases and anti-aircraft batteries. Unlike many SOE agents whose priority at that time in the war was to gather intelligence and arm and organize resistance groups, Trotobas's job was explicitly sabotage. His priority was railroads. In his arrival by parachute, most of Trotobas's baggage and equipment was lost and he arrived in Lille with only a small pistol and 250,000 French francs (about 1,250 British pounds). Moreover, he arrived in Lille knowing nobody and with no contacts, but with a knowledge of the city due to his military service. He made the rounds of bars and gambling dens, activities he enjoyed, spending money freely while recruiting people for the resistance among the \\"less savory\\" elements of the society, people who understood \\"the importance of keeping their mouths shut.\\" Many of his best associates were Poles who were refugees from the German occupation of their country. Trotobas's first recruit was Emmanuel Lemercier, a bookseller and a former French soldier with extensive contacts, who he met during a card game. He also met Denise Gilman, a 22 year old waitress, who became his \\"hard-working courier, steadfast companion, lover, and confidant.\\" By late January 1943 he had recruited about 20 persons, including Pierre S√©ailles, 23 years old and a friend from the Mauzac prison, who became his deputy. By August 1943, the Farmer network had more than 800 members scattered over a wide area in northwestern France. Trotobas established his headquarters, which became a bee-hive of activity, in a back room of the Aquarium Cafe owned by Madeleine Thirou near the center of Lille. Trotobas often dressed in the uniform of a French policeman. Trotobas insisted that each of his recruits be fully informed of the risks he or she was taking, sign an oath pledging to follow orders and never to reveal information about the network and its members, and agree to a 17-item list of duties and obligations. Members of the network were identified only by number or code name, never by real name. Trotobas also kept his location and travels secret from all but a few sector and group leaders. Trotobas's organization was \\"an illustration of his meticulous planning and attention to detail.\\" By October 1943, Trotobas had established seven geographic sectors of the Farmer network, each with its leader and all under his supervision. The Farmer network also supported an escape line, helping downed allied airmen and stranded soldiers escape France to Spain. A young black-marketeer named Pierre Duval headed the escape line which was based in the city of Abbeville. Sabotage In February 1943, Trotobas organized his first successful sabotage mission, derailing 40 railway cars and closing the railroad for two days. Over the following months, his growing army of supporters began to carry out 15 to 20 derailments per week, creating delays is the supply of military goods to the large German forces in the Lille region. His largest sabotage operation was the night of 27/28 June 1943 when Trotobas, with a forged Gestapo identification card, and 20 men dressed in gendarmerie uniforms talked their way into the locomotive works in Lille and destroyed four million litres of oil and damaged 22 transformers. The operation demonstrated to SOE in London that sabotage was a viable alternative to air bombing raids which inevitably killed French citizens and jeopardized French support for the allies. The Royal Air Force had attempted unsuccessfully four times to bomb the factory. In London the Ministry of Economic Warfare and the Air Ministry were skeptical of Trotobas's claim of a successful operation and rather than offer congratulations requested photographs of the bombed factory, no easy task as the Germans were now \\"rounding up railway workers, racing through working class districts in their squad cars, and smashing in the doors to drag out wives and children as hostages.\\" Trotobas gained access to the factory with a forged pass identifying him as an official of an insurance agency, persuaded the Germans investigating the ruins to help him take photographs, and sent the photos to London. When the Air Ministry opened the package of photos it found a card saying \\"With the compliments of the Resistance.\\" Weaknesses SOE networks were more secure in rural areas which had a much lighter presence of German soldiers and milice, the pro-German French militia, than industrial cities such as Lille, especially as Lille was near the coastline that was a likely spot for an allied invasion of France. The dense population and German presence near Lille made it difficult to find isolated rural sites for clandestine air drops of arms and equipment. The RAF was reluctant to undertake supply missions near Lille due to the heavy volume of anti-aircraft fire that greeted its aircraft. The distant sites of the air drops meant that the Farmer circuit had to transport supplies by road to its scattered groups, a dangerous undertaking. Moreover, communications with London were difficult and infrequent. The wireless operator assigned to Farmer, Arthur Staggs, proved to be useless and SOE was never able to get a replacement for him to Trotobas. For communication, arms, supplies, and money Trotobas was initially forced to rely on what the Prosper network in Paris would give him. Later, wireless operator Yolande Beekman of the Musician network located in Saint- Quentin, a hazardous journey of south of Lille, communicated with London for the Farmer network. Due to the problem with communications, the first airdrop of supplies for the Farmer network was not until 13 April 1943. Most successful SOE agents maintained a low profile, but Trotobas had both notoriety and a penchant for risk taking. He frequented bars, sought out women companions, and spent freely. Often while drinking he would leave the bar and go out to the street and fire his Sten gun into the air to unnerve the German soldiers in the town. A close associate told the story of how he once confronted a German officer in a jewelry store, displayed the two revolvers he carried, and challenged the officer to try to oppose him. The German declined the challenge. Downfall On 23 June 1943, a young SOE agent and saboteur named Francois Reeve, code named \\"Olivier,\\" joined Trotobas in Lille. Trotobas assigned him to take charge of the Arras sector of the Farmer network, but Reeve upset the tight-knit group heading the Farmer network. Reeve was described by Trotobas's deputy Pierre S√©ailles as \\"not up to the job\\" and by others as \\"boastful and vain, not particularly intelligent\\" and jealous of the reputation of Trotobas. He was also called \\"the human arsenal\\" for his habit of carrying two or three revolvers on his person. Also in June came the destruction of the Prosper network in Paris by the Germans. Prosper was the largest SOE network in France and its demise eliminated many of the people and resources needed by SOE networks in northern France. In July and August came a series of arrests and betrayals by key leaders and associates of the Farmer network. Trotobas was reported by an associate to be traveling with two bodyguards, smoking incessantly, losing weight, and \\"on the verge of a breakdown.\\" He was in bed sick for a few days. With the Germans now aware of him, Trotobas changed his appearance by dying his blond hair black, shaving his mustache, and wearing the uniform of a pro-German paramilitary organization, the Groupe mobile de r√©serve. Denise Gilman also changed her appearance A growing problem for Trotobas was his first recruit to the Farmer network, Emmanuel Lemercier, who resented being pushed out of the position of deputy to Trotobas and became increasingly erratic, making threats to other members of Farmer that he was going to betray them to the Germans. Trotobas planned to send Lemercier to England to get him out of the way, but before that could happen, Reeve executed Lemercier on 3 November 1943. Reeve would later claim that the execution was ordered by Trotobas. Despite the internal strife, Trotobas continued to lead sabotage missions and collect parachuted arms for the resistance. In early November 1944, the Farmer Network carried out four derailments of trains in five days leaving the line \\"absolutely littered\\" with damaged railway equipment. However, on 12 November, an associate named Yvonne Pachy saw him and said he was gaunt, exhausted, suffering from pneumonia, and pessimistic, telling her that he might not see her again. On 24 November Denise Gilman was also ill (possibly pregnant) and Trotobas stayed with her in an apartment that he feared might not be safe, but with the German crackdown, the pair seemed to have run out of hideouts in Lille. Early in the morning of 27 November, Francois Reeve was captured by the Germans without a fight and roughly interrogated. SOE's guidance to captured agents who were being tortured was to try to remain silent for at least 48 hours to allow their colleagues and associates time to change locations and cover their tracks. Reeve lasted less than 2 hours between his capture and leading the Germans to the house where Trotobas was staying, although Reeve later said he believed that Trotobas would not be present in the house. Trotobas was in fact there and at 7 a.m. the German military police broke into the house. Trotobas resisted and killed the leader of the German raiders and wounded another German before being killed himself. His courier and lover Denise Gilman was shot in the stomach and died half an hour later. The monument to the Sylvestre Farmer Network of Capitaine Michel in Lille. A later court of inquiry in England concluded that Reeve was not guilty of deliberate disloyalty, \\"but it cannot be said in his favour that he showed as much consistency and firmness of character when being maltreated by the Germans as has been shown by a great many other agents in similar circumstances.\\" Legacy The Farmer circuit did not die with Michael Trotobas. Pierre S√©ailles become the leader and a report to SOE said that \\"the threads of the organization....remain unbroken and ready for the resumption of activity.\\" A few days after Trotobas's death, the Farmer circuit destroyed 11 locomotives at Tourcoing. The casualties of the Farmer circuit were heavy. Of its 800 1o 1,000 members, more than 300 were killed in action, executed, or disappeared in German concentration camps during 1943 and 1944. Trotobas was declared ineligible for a Victoria Cross as no senior office was present to report on his actions. Thus, he received no commendation from Britain, but France posthumously gave him the Medal of Resistance. After World War II in Lille an organization was formed called the \\"French Association of Friends of Captain Michel.\\" Annually until the 1990s a delegation of the Middlesex Regiment visited Lille and the house where Trotobas was killed. The citizens of Lille named a street and a housing estate after him and a plaque at 20 Boulevard de Belfort, the site of the house where he was killed, commemorates him and his \\"devoted collaborator\\" Denise Gilman. A monument to the \\"Sylvestre-Farmer network of Capitaine Michel\\" is in a cemetery in Lille. In 2018, a blue plaque honoring his memory was unveiled at the site of his birth in Brighton.

Premonitory urges are \\"uncomfortable feelings or sensations preceding tics that usually are relieved by [a particular] movement\\". \\"Individuals with tics may have either a generalized or a localized sensation of tension that is relieved by movement, [that is] the tic.\\" Sensory phenomena in tic disorders include bodily sensations, mental urges, and a sense of inner tension, feelings of incompleteness, and a need for things to be \\"just right\\". Bodily sensations include focal or generalized body sensations (usually tactile, muscular-skeletal/visceral, or both); mental sensations include urge only, energy release (mental energy that builds up and needs to be discharged), incompleteness, and just-right perceptions. Published descriptions of the tics of Tourette's identify sensory phenomena as the core symptom of Tourette syndrome, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria. In contrast to the stereotyped movements of other movement disorders such as choreas, dystonias, myoclonus, and dyskinesias, the tics of Tourette's are temporarily suppressible and preceded by this premonitory urge. Immediately preceding tic onset, most individuals with Tourette syndrome are aware of an urge, which is similar to the need to sneeze or scratch an itch. Individuals describe the need to tic as the buildup of tension in a particular anatomical location, which they consciously choose to release, as if the subject \\"had to do it\\". Examples of the premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one's throat, or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one's throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch. Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye. The presence of sensory phenomena differentiates subjects with Tourette syndrome plus obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) from subjects with OCD alone, and may be an important measure for grouping patients along the OCD-Tourette's disorder spectrum.

On 3 September 2020, the ship caught fire off the eastern coast of Sri Lanka, resulting in the death of a Filipino crew member. After burning intermittently for almost a week, the fire was reported to be extinguished by 11 September. Ship The ship was built as Ikomasan by Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding in Chiba, Japan. Its keel was laid on 14 December 1999, it was launched on 10 August 2000, and was delivered on 29 November 2000. In 2013, the vessel was renamed Diamond Warrior, and again to New Diamond the following year. New Diamond has a gross tonnage of 160,079 GT and a deadweight tonnage of 299,986 DWT. It measures long, with a beam of , and is powered by a single diesel engine that gives it a speed of . At the time of its fire, New Diamond was owned by the Greek company Porto Emporios Shipping Inc.  Fire  On 3 September 2020, a fire broke out in the engine room of New Diamond at around 07:45 local time (SLST), when the ship was about east of Sri Lanka in the Sangaman Kanda Point. At the time, the ship was carrying 270,000 tonnes of oil from Kuwait to the Paradip refinery in India, with 18 Filipino and five Greek crewmembers on board. The cargo was loaded on 23 August 2020 at Mina al Ahmadi and was due to arrive at Paradip on 5 September. The ship was chartered for the voyage by the Indian Oil Corporation. Reuters reported that the fire was triggered by an explosion and was initially brought under control before spreading upwards to the ship's bridge. The Sri Lankan Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) said it believed that the ship's cargo tanks were intact following the fire, but that a slight oil slick had been sighted, perhaps from the fuel oil on board. MEPA said that early on 4 September two explosions were reported from New Diamond, though the Sri Lankan Army said that there was no danger of an oil leak at the time. In the meantime, the government of the Maldives had expressed worry, with a presidential minister saying that the country needed to take all precautions to prevent oil from reaching its shores.  Rescue operations  19 sailors were rescued by the commercial vessel Helen M, two by the Sri Lanka Navy ship , and one by the Navy ship Ranarisi, which landed a rescue party aboard New Diamond. A Filipino crew member died in the fire. 22 crew members were rescued and one person who sustained burn injuries was admitted to the Kalmunai Hospital. A total of four Sri Lankan ships responded to the incident, as well as a surveillance aircraft of the Sri Lanka Air Force. International responders included an Indian Coast Guard ship and three Indian Navy vessels, and two Russian Navy ships that were in Sri Lanka for scheduled exercises at the time. In addition, a Mi-17 helicopter of the Sri Lanka Air Force was also deployed in the search operation. On 6 September, Sri Lanka Navy Commander Nishantha Ulugetenne said that the fire had been brought under control after 36 hours of rescue operations. However, it subsequently ignited again and burned for several more days before being declared contained on 9 September. By then, rescue operations had grown to more than a dozen ships from India and Sri Lanka, while the Sri Lanka Air Force had carried out 176 missions to drop about of water and of fire suppressing chemicals. The fire was extinguished by 11 September, when salvage teams boarded New Diamond to work on staunching a fuel oil leak and prepare the ship for a tow to a port where the cargo of crude oil would be unloaded. In late September, New Diamond was taken under tow for the port of Kandla in western Indian state of Gujarat for the offloading of her cargo of crude oil, though the destination was subsequently changed to the port of Khor Fakkan in the United Arab Emirates, where the oil would be transferred to a different tanker for transport to Paradip. Legal actions On 9 September 2020, MEPA announced that it planned to take legal action against the owner of New Diamond on grounds of violating Sri Lankan environmental protection laws. The captain of New Diamond, Stereo Sterio Ilias, was charged in the Colombo High Court by the Sri Lankan attorney general of causing an oil spill and violating the Marine Environment Protection Authority Act, with a fine of $1 million sought; the court decreased the fine to $65,000 and Ilias was released after paying. The ship's owner was charged $2.4 million for the firefighting effort, which the company paid as a condition of towing New Diamond out of Sri Lankan waters.

Weld was a crypto-recusant who kept his religious allegiance secret in order to stay in public office during a turbulent political period in English history. He was appointed Cup-bearer to the Catholic Queen Henrietta Maria 1639-44 and later as Gentleman of the Privy Chamber 1668-85 under her son, Charles II. He served as a magistrate and in numerous other public roles in London, Middlesex, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire and in Dorset, where he was governor of Portland Castle. In 1641 he bought the Lulworth Estate in Dorset where he started the \\"Lulworth\\" line of the (recusant) Weld family which has continued for over 350 years. Background Sir John Weld (1585-1622), father of Humphrey Weld was the first surviving son of Sir John Weld of Arnolds, Edmonton, Middlesex and Frances n√©e Whitmore of Apley Park, Shropshire. The Whitmores and the Welds intermarried over several generations. His paternal grandfather and namesake was Sir Humphrey Weld, a merchant originally from Shropshire and Lord Mayor of London. Weld graduated in Law from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1629 and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1631. Between 1633-6 he went on a Grand Tour of Europe. Weld's parents and sisters were apparently committed Protestants, but he and his two brothers married into prominent Roman Catholic families and changed their religious adherence. Life On his return to London from the Continent, Humphrey Weld was quickly appointed to the Queen's household as Cup-bearer in 1639 and began his official career. In 1641 he was assessed as a recusant for the London Poll tax. Correspondence between Weld and the secular English Catholic priest, Peter Biddulph, alias 'Fitton' (b. 1600), stationed in Rome, suggests they would have first met in Europe and kept a long association based on the older man's religious influence and connoisseurship of art which led to Weld himself becoming a collector. =Property portfolio= Lulworth Castle, Dorset Weld had acquired a newly built mansion in Aldwych Close on 25 February 1639 or 1640 for the sum of ¬£2,600. He named the large property at the back of Drury Lane then just inside the county of Middlesex, \\"Weld House\\". In 1649 he bought out the rest of the Close and assigned it to his widowed mother, Frances, who three years later, reassigned it back to him. He drew rents from its wealthy occupants, including the ambassadors of France, Portugal and Spain over a number of years.'Site of Weld House', in Survey of London: Volume 5, St Giles- in-The-Fields, Pt II, ed.

In 1641, with the assistance of his brother Sir John Weld of Compton Bassett, he bought the vast Lulworth Manor and its castellated Mock castle from Thomas Howard, 3rd Viscount Howard of Bindon for ¬£42,860.'Lulworth, East', in An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in Dorset, Volume 2, South east (London, 1970), pp. 144-151. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/rchme/dorset/vol2/pp144-151 [accessed 31 August 2020]. He spent most of the Civil War with the Court in Oxford, and he was at Worcester when the Cavalier garrison surrendered in 1646. Meanwhile, his own property at Lulworth had been commandeered by a garrison of Roundheads who caused some damage to the fabric of the castle. Armed with a certificate of (Anglican) church attendance and of having received communion at St Giles in the Fields and at East Lulworth, he petitioned to collect on the damages to his properties during the civil conflict, but was instead fined ¬£996, a moderate sum for him. Though he alleged damage to his property of ¬£2,200 and debts of ¬£12,400, he could still manage to afford to commission paintings from Europe ‚Äòexquisitely done and by the best masters‚Äô. Since some of these were ‚Äòpieces of devotion‚Äô, and since all his servants were recusants, the Dorset committee had sufficient grounds to exact from him the oath of abjuration, which he managed to evade. He had sufficiently purged his recusancy to be allowed to buy back the forfeited estates of his nephew, Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour, and the Bedfordshire property of the Earl of Cleveland, which had been mortgaged to him. =Royal Conduit, controversialist and MP= Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England King Charles II (1665) anon. At the Restoration of Charles II, Weld was made governor of Portland and granted a secret service pension of ¬£1,000 p.a. for maintaining an underground correspondence between the King and the French Court. In 1661 he applied unsuccessfully to the electors of Wareham, six miles from Lulworth, but was returned to the Cavalier Parliament for Christchurch, where his wife and her sisters owned the manor. He had a Protestant Weld cousin in Parliament. Only five committees are attributed to him by full name, and he was probably a less active Member of the Cavalier Parliament than his cousin, George Weld. But as a Middlesex Justice of the peace he was both active and unpopular. Sir Richard Everard, 2nd Baronet complained that Weld's attitude towards those applying the laws against \\"Popery\\", ‚Äòargues more affection to Babylon than to the crown of England‚Äô. As treasurer of the Middlesex workhouse, it was probably Weld rather than his cousin, Sir John Weld, who served on the committee for the additional Poor Law of 1664. Although listed as a court dependant, he lost the Dorset lieutenancy later in 1664, probably as a result of a dispute with Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond over defences at Sandsfoot Castle, but after he petitioned government with local support, it was restored to him. In 1666, he took the chair for his brother's bill to permit foreclosure in 1667‚Äì8. He was given a royal court appointment as Gentleman of the Privy Chamber in 1668, a position he kept until his death, and his pension, which had been suspended, was also restored. On 15 May 1671 he complained that \\"Weld House\\" had been attacked by a mob yelling, ‚ÄòThis is the grand justice that hangs and quarters us all‚Äô, and was saved by the chance arrival of a guard patrol. =Recusancy Commission= Weld was appointed to the first Hampshire 'recusancy commission' of 1675, but struck off four months later. Despite reservations about him, in 1677 Lord Shaftesbury nevertheless considered him ‚Äòworthy‚Äô. In this period Weld had offered to 'discover' lands in Bedfordshire bequeathed to trustees for the benefit of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1678 he was probably appointed to the committee for the bill to enable the trustees of Sir Ralph Bankes to sell his lands. After consultation he pronounced on the spuriousness of the petition which led to yet further enquiries. =During the Popish Plot= During the Popish Plot, it was reported that Weld had been expelled from the House of Commons. Titus Oates swore that he had attended Mass with him at \\"Weld House\\", and that Weld had received a dispensation from the general of the Jesuits to \\"take the oaths and the Test\\", which would enable him ‚Äòby his interest to hinder proceedings in Parliament against the Roman Catholics‚Äô. In his only recorded Commons speech, Weld said: ‚ÄòI desire to know what I am accused of. I never had Mass in my house in my life, nor went to an ambassador‚Äôs house to hear Mass. Let any man spit in my face if he can prove it.‚Äô Weld was on the court list of government supporters at this time, but not on the opposition list of the ‚Äòunanimous club‚Äô. The sale of the Lordship of the manor of Christchurch to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon meant Weld was left without a constituency, and he did not stand again. He procured a Certificate of conformity from St. Martin in the Fields, where his daughter was married to the Earl of Carlingford the following year, in 1663.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, Volume 2. H. Colburn, 1847. pp. 1545-6 view on line However this did not prevent a search of his Middlesex property, \\"Weld House\\", which was partly let to the Spanish Embassy, or his dismissal from local office.

Woods served two terms in the Legislative Assembly of the new province. He was elected in 1841 to the first Parliament of the Province of Canada, representing the riding of Kent in Canada West (now Ontario). He was defeated in the general election of 1844, but re-elected in a subsequent by-election in 1845 when the Kent seat became vacant. Woods was a Compact Tory, a conservative who supported the Family Compact, the oligarchic group which had controlled the government of Upper Canada prior to the merger with Lower Canada. In the general election of 1841 for the first Parliament, he won the election for the Kent riding,C√¥t√©, Political Appointments and Elections, pp. 43-45: \\"First Parliament. 8th April 1841 to 23rd September 1844\\". defeating the Reform candidate for the Kent riding, Samuel Bealey Harrison.Paul G. Cornell, Alignment of Political Groups in Canada, 1841-67 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1962; reprinted in paperback 2015), p. 6. The election was hotly contested, and the returning officer refused to make a return of the writ.Journals of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, 1st Parliament, 1st Session, 1841, pp. 10‚Äì11. Woods successfully petitioned the Legislative Assembly to be declared the winner of the election.Journals of the Legislative Assembly, pp. 33‚Äì34.C√¥t√©, Political Appointments and Elections, p. 59, note (14). Following the election, there was a large public dinner held in his honour in the town of Chatham on July 16, 1841. Amongst those who attended were the defeated candidate, Harrison, and Colonel Prince, who had been elected in the neighbouring riding of Essex. After the dinner, there were toasts to Queen Victoria and to the Governor General of the Province of Canada, and British patriotic songs were sung.Helene Pirkey, \\"Housekeeping and Entertaining in Chatham ‚Äì 1840-1845\\", Kent Historical Society: Papers and Addresses (Chatham: Kent Historical Society, 1986), at pp. 42‚Äì43, quoting a contemporary account in the Western Herald, Sandwich, and at p. 56, quoting from the Chatham Journal, July 28, 1841. Analysing the overall election results, the Governor General, Lord Sydenham, stated that he believed that there were about six Compact Tories who would oppose his administration. Woods was likely amongst those six.Cornell, Alignment of Political Groups in Canada, 1841-67, p. 7. In the first session of the Parliament, Woods voted in support of the union, but also voted with the other Compact Tories in opposition to Sydenham's attempts to form a broad-based government across factional lines. In subsequent sessions, he voted consistently with the other Compact Tories, against proposals that tended to increase the authority of the Assembly over that of the Governor General.Cornell, Alignment of Political Groups in Canada, 1841-67, pp. 93‚Äì97.

It is found in sub-Saharan Africa, India, tropical southern Asia, the Philippines, New Guinea and parts of Australia, and is commonly known as sea bean or burny bean. Description Mucuna gigantea is a large woody liana, growing to a length of about . The stem is at first thickly clad in orange- brown bristly hairs, and bears alternate, trifoliate leaves with petioles up to long. The leaflets are ovate or elliptical, and up to long; the lateral leaflets are oblique, and all leaflets have rounded bases and apiculate tips. The inflorescence grows from the leaf axil, and is a pendulous, umbel-like bunch with the individual flowers on short lateral stalks. Each flower has a cup-shaped calyx with two lips, clad in fine greyish hairs. The corolla lobes are white, creamy-green or pale lilac; the standard is up to long, and the wings and keel slightly longer. The fruits are oblong pods, covered in orange- brown bristly hairs at first, up to long, each margin having two wings. The seeds are disc-like and dark brown or black. Distribution and habitat Mucuna gigantea occurs in tropical Africa, southwestern and southern Asia, various Pacific islands and parts of Australia. In Africa its range extends from the Republic of Congo to Kenya, Tanzania and Madagascar. In Asia, its range includes India, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, and it occurs in various islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It occurs in New Guinea, and in Australia, in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and New South Wales. It mainly occurs in coastal scrubland, and when it occurs inland, as it does particularly in Africa, it is generally found near water, on riverbanks and lake shores, in scrub, at the edges of forests and in woodland. Ecology Drift seeds of three legume species found on the southern Mozambique coast: 1\\\\. Snuff box sea bean (Entada rheedii) 2\\\\. Grey nickernut (Guilandina bonduc) 3\\\\. a,b Varying colour forms of Mucuna gigantea Germination in this species is hypogeal, the cotyledons remaining below the soil surface. The first true leaves are scale-like, and growth is very rapid, a height of a metre or more occurring in three weeks. The tissues are easily damaged, even the flowers turning black when injured. The flowers are a favourite with hummingbirds, and the seeds can be dispersed for long distances by sea currents, giving it a near pan-tropical distribution. Nutrition Analysis of the seeds shows 30.6% crude proteins, 9% crude lipids, 6% ash and 42.8% nitrogen free extract. The beans contain a relatively high proportion of the essential amino acids, leucine and isoleucine, and the minerals potassium, calcium, magnesium and iron are also abundant. Also present is the amino acid levodopa, which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, but the beans also contain toxins, which can only be destroyed by lengthy soaking and boiling. Uses After suitable preparation, the seeds are eaten in Kenya and India. Aboriginal Australians bake them on hot stones, and having removed the skin, grind them into flour, mix this with water, wrap the dough in leaves and further bake it. An extract of the root has been used against schistosomiasis and gonorrhea, and the powdered seeds have been used as a laxative. The intensely irritating hairs from the pods have been used as poison in Malaysia, and have been mixed with food for control of rats.

Opened in 1978, it is the oldest in the state and the only one in North Jersey. It is known for its live entertainment, its familial atmosphere, and its assistance to vulnerable LGBT youth and the local poor. The club was ordered to close in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Though it was able to reopen for limited outdoor service in the summer, its owner, Paul Binetti, announced in June that the venue was experiencing severe financial hardship, and he launched a GoFundMe page in a bid to secure enough funds to remain in business. Description Owned by Paul Binetti, Club Feathers is the last operational gay nightclub in North Jersey. It is known for its live entertainment featuring drag queens and go-go dancers; its weekly event calendar normally includes \\"Pop Wednesday\\", \\"Latin Thursday\\" and \\"Drag Friday\\". Customers describe the club's atmosphere as welcoming and note its tight-knit community of staff and clientele. Binetti stated that \\"[t]he bond between patrons became even stronger after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida in 2016\\". Feathers is often a first stop for local LGBT people after they come out of the closet. It is also active in charity work: in addition to helping disadvantaged queer youth get on their feet, it cooks and serves food to the local poor. History =Early years and operation= Club Feathers opened in River Edge on June 21, 1978, making it the oldest gay nightclub in New Jersey. According to Binetti, \\"[Feathers] opened so that [the New Jersey LGBT] community could have a safe place to call [its] own.\\" In the venue's early years, it was treated as unwelcome in the area: the local government attempted to shut it down it multiple times, and the building was twice set on fire with Molotov cocktails. Eddie Kallen, the club's longtime employee and its current manager, recalled: \\"People used to scream things out the window as they were driving by. They used to throw things at the place.\\" The original owner fought back despite the persistent harassment. Since its inception, Feathers has also served as a de facto support center for LGBT youth. It has helped find work and housing for individuals who have been kicked out of their homes, sometimes footing the bill for their rent. On New Year's Day in 2018, a small fire broke out in a duct in the club's kitchen, shuttering the business for the day. Damage was minimal, and the venue reopened two days later. Celebrities such as The Village People and Cardi B have been regulars at Feathers. =COVID-19 pandemic= Like all the New Jersey nightlife venues, Feathers was ordered to cease operation in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Binetti applied for loans from the Paycheck Protection Program in hopes of securing the club financially, but he was not granted any aid. In June, Feathers reopened for takeout and outdoor dining, functioning on a skeleton staff of four employees and receiving about 50 customers per week, down from a pre-COVID high of 1,500. Binetti changed the business model from nightclub to restaurant, hired a new chef, modified the establishment's menu, and converted its back lot into a seating area in an attempt to maximize revenue under the new arrangements. Nevertheless, although the venue had reopened on June 15, its profits for the month totaled just $1,200. At the end of June, when Governor Phil Murphy walked back plans to reopen indoor dining, Binetti announced that Feathers would no longer be able to tide itself over with outdoor operations alone. On June 28, he launched a $75,000 GoFundMe campaign to raise the funds needed to pay off the overdue rent and taxes that the club had accrued in the four months it was closed. By July 24, donations totaled $45,000, which was enough to cover the rent. Binetti stated that the remaining balance would need to be collected within 45 days in order to keep Feathers afloat. Celebrity performers from RuPaul's Drag Race and The Village People offered to help organize a benefit for the club, but its reduced capacity presented practical problems. As of late July, local drag queens and DJs were regularly donating socially distant performances in Feathers' outdoor dining area to help with fundraising efforts. As of October, staple shows included a weekly drag brunch and other performances by Pissi Myles. Reception Daniel Reynolds of The Advocate wrote that visiting Feathers is \\"a rite of passage for LGBTQ+ New Jerseyans in coming out\\".

She is most known for her illustrations of cats, including in the books The Tyger Voyage by Richard Adams, The Mousehole Cat by Antonia Barber, Katje, The Windmill Cat by Gretchen Woelfle and others. Life and career Bayley was born on August 18, 1949 in Singapore. She grew up in China and Hampshire, England and attended an English boarding school. She originally planned to study to become a fashion designer. Instead, she attended St. Martin's School of Art in London and studied graphic design, focusing on illustration in her later years there under Fritz Wegner and John Farman. After, she studied at the Royal College of Art in London under Quentin Blake. Publisher Tom Maschlerer noticed her final portfolio from the Royal College of Art and commissioned her to illustrate a book. This led to her first book, Nicola Bayley's Book of Nursery Rhymes, being published by Jonathan Cape in 1975. Richard Adams was inspired by Bayley's illustration for the nursery rhyme, \\"Three Thick Thumping Tigers Taking Toast for Tea\\", and he subsequently wrote a prose poem based on her work. The poem was turned into a book called The Tyger Voyage, which Bayley illustrated. Released in 1976, it was Bayley's second book published by Jonathan Cape. In 1977, her book One Old Oxford Ox was published, containing a collection of tongue twisters. In 1984, she created the Copycat series, which included the books Parrot Cat, Polar Bear Cat, Elephant Cat, Spider Cat and Crab Cat. The 1990 book The Mousehole Cat, written by Antonia Barber and illustrated by Bayley, won the British Book Award for illustrated children's books. She wrote and illustrated the 1998 book, The Necessary Cat. Style Bayley's illustrations are painted using a stippling effect, created by using brushes to make thousands of small dots. She works with watercolors, which is her preferred medium. Her illustrations were often based on her own pet cats.

According to British sources, the number of military personnel he commanded stood at 2200, the highest battalion total for a solo commander in Darawiish history. Suleiman Aden Galaydh is also the only Darawiish commander to command three different types of military forces simultaneously, namely a cavalry, spearmen division and riflemen division. He hails from the Aden Gallaydh family, the most prominent family within the Darawiish. Commentary from Colonel Kenna within the British War Office intimate that Suleiman Aden Galaydh's force constitued the flank of the dervish (darawiish) army:https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3640121/3640124/41/ The dervish flank is usually associated with the Golaweyne division of the Darawiish, meaning that Suleiman Aden Galaydh was commander of Golaweyne. > Colonel Kenna sent parties of the tribal horse round on either side of the > bush to take the enemy in the rear ... The enemy were under Suleiman Aden British War Office reports derived from captives in the British camp state that the darawiish flank commander Suleiman Aden Galaydh commanded 2,200 troops, which consisted of three different types of military units, i.e. cavalry, riflemen and spearmen, at 200, 500, and 1500 respectively. This is the highest count of troops commanded by a single dervish commander; its also the most varied brigade commanded by a single dervish commander: > The enemy were under Suleiman Aden; their estimated strength was 500 rifles > and 1,500 spears, with 200 ponies. Fighting style and Gumburu Agaarweyne Suleiman Aden Galaydh's fighting style has been described as a line formation and as highly confident: > The enemy was formed up three deep in a line 1,500 yards long. It being > found that they were in greater strength than had been expected ... The > enemy were under Suleiman Aden ... The confident and determined manner in > which the enemy stood their ground gives reason to hope that the Mullah will > make a stand against the British advance. The year 1903 when Suleiman Aden Galaydh was commander was the year when the battle of Gumburka Cagaarweyne, known to the British soldiers as Gumburu. This battle was described as so deadly, that random birds of prey who were dissected by their owners were found to have human remains inside: British sources agree that the Agaarweyne battle was deadly, and state that the darawiish stole all the equipment belonging to the colonialists and left every single British officer dead; the dead included the British Lieutenant general Arthur William Valentine PlunkettMad Mullah of Somaliland, Douglas Jardine: > ... topee and whistle had, doubtless, been taken from Gumburu‚Äôs stricken > field, as also had been other articles of the Dervish equipment, such as the > black cloth caps of the Yaos, the khaki puggarees of the Sikhs, and the > Mannlicher cartridges belonging to the Mannlicher sporting rifle possessed > by poor Johnston-Stewart, the only weapon of its kind with the force ... > Plunkett, with all officers, had been cut up at Gumburu, and the Obbia force > was still concentrated at Galadi. Aden Galaydh family Suleiman Aden Galaydh hails from the notable Aden Galaydh Ducaale family, one of the most prominent families in the Darawiish. The Aden Galaydh Ducaale family was the most important dervish family during the early colonial dervish battles. They hail from the Ali Geri tribe, one of the only dervish clans whom remained loyal dervishes from the start to the end. In the poem \\"Doqon baan ogayn\\", the Sayid Mohamed, head of state of the Darawiish, compares the efforts of Aden Galaydhs offspring, the contemporaneous patriarch of the family, and by extension his offspring, with a way of life or a prophet, with the following line \\"Dabkuu shidayay Aw-Aaden, waa diinta Nebigiiyee\\", meaning the light shone by the aden galaydh family is that of a prophet or of a way of life itself.https://maktabadda.com/diiwaanka- gabayadii-sayid-maxamed-cabdulle-xasan/doqon-baan-ogayn-suudiyow/ Most of the Aden Galaydh passed away whilst fighting at the Jidbali battle in 1904. One of the few survivors of this family was Saliid Baynax Aaden, Suleiman's nephew, who went on to live in Marqaanweyne from where he recounted incidents and narrations of the anti-colonial battles to the beginning of the century. The brothers Xayd and Beynax are both referred to by Sayid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan, the dervish head of state as \\"gaanaha\\" and \\"garaadada\\", the former meaning a field marshal and the latter a chieftain. This means that three of the Aden Galaydh brothers, were all dervish commanders, namely Suleiman Aden Galaydh, Xayd Aden Galaydh and Beynax Aden Galaydh. =Xayd Aden Galaydh= Suleiman Aden Galaydh wasn't the only notable figure of the Aden Galaydh family to play a major role in the Jidbali battle between the Darawiish and three colonial powers, i.e. the British, Abyssinians and Italians. His brother Xayd Aaden Galaydh was the person who had the foresight to see exactly what was going to occur and proposed moving to A place near Xudun with concealment. This was opposed by Jaamac Boos who opposed this and made the detrimental order that the dervishes have to stand their ground at all costs. This detrimental decision cost the lives of thousands of dervishes including much of the Aden Galaydh family. The suggestion Xayd Aden Galaydh made was as follows: The suggestion made by Jaamac Boos was one that was a proponent of jihad, whilst retrospectively, that of Xayd Aden Galaydh's suggestion was one of logic, that would have allowed the anti-colonial darawiish to divert military disaster that was suffered by them at Jidbali. The description of Xayd Aden Galaydh's death at Jidbaale was especially gruesome, with accounts of his corpse being described as being scattered all over the battlefield. =Beynax Aden Galaydh= His brother Baynax Aden Galaydh is mentioned in the Indha-caadlayaal oration by the Sayid via the line \\"Cantallaaga lna-Aadanaa, cawro sii dhigay e\\" wherein he only addresses qusuusis (advisory council members), after an incident wherein they abandoned their flock in the face of an enemy resulting in besmirching commentary from the Sayid; this incident proves that Baynax Aden Galaydh was also a qusuusi. The Gudban poem tells the most extensive story about the fate of the Aden Galaydh family. The 127th line of this poem (Guxushaaga Beynaxa ilmadu, waataan gabaxleyne), is especially moving as it recounts how Beynax is near permanently sad at how three of his sons died in this battle. Beynax was the eldest of the three brothers.https://org.uib.no/smi/sa/10/10Defeat.pdf References Category:1867 births Category:1904 deaths ","title":"Suleiman Aden Galaydh"},{"id":"65212636","text":"Emmanuel MorrisAnglican Communion is an Anglican bishop in Nigeria:Vanguard, Nigeria he is the current Bishop of Maiduguri,Metro Watch Online one of ten dioceses within the Anglican Province of Jos, itself one of 14 provinces within the Church of Nigeria.Church of Nigeria Notes Category:Living people Category:Bishops of Maiduguri Category:21st-century Anglican bishops Category:Nigerian Anglicans ","title":"Emmanuel Morris"},{"id":"65212663","text":"The Anglican Diocese of LangtangAnglican Communion is one of ten within the Anglican Province of Jos, itself one of 14 provinces within the Church of Nigeria.Church of Nigeria The current bishop is Stanley Fube.Episcopal Church Notes Category:Anglicanism in Nigeria Category:Dioceses of the Province of Jos Category:Bishops of Langtang ","title":"Anglican Diocese of Langtang"},{"id":"65212693","text":"Star Crystal is a 1985 video game published by Ba'rac Limited.

Through her work, in 1926 she met Adolf Ehlers (1898‚Äì1978), a political activist who at around the same time was readmitted to the Communist Party. She became his secretary and then, in 1928, his wife. Ella Schimpf had grown up in a heavily politicised family, and she now participated energetically with her husband in the increasingly polarised politics of the time. After 1933 she engaged in dangerous (and illegal) anti- government resistance, but she nevertheless survived the twelve Hitler years. In 1945 she rejoined the (no longer illegal) Communist Party, but switched the next year to the SPD and built a new political career in Bremen, at times working closely with her husband who became a senator and later, between 1959 and 1963, mayor of the city. Her own focus was mostly on the social and welfare sectors. She was involved in the setting up of several new support organisations. Ella Ehlers' final major role came in 1964 when she was appointed to chair the state committee of the Workers' Welfare organisation.  Life  = Provenance and early years = Ella Schimpf was born in Dresden, the youngest of her parents' three children. Karl Schimpf, father worked as a glazier and cabinet maker. Her mother Maria had worked in one of Dresden's many cigarette factories, but after the births of the children switched to making hand-rolled cigarettes as a \\"home worker\\". Both her parents were active trades unionists and, by 1900, members of the still far from mainstream Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). Politics and socialism were frequently discussed within the family, often with great passion. At the age of eight Ella would join her brother to deliver the pro-SPD Leipziger Volkszeitung (Newspaper), in order to be able to contribute to the family housekeeping budget. = War = In 1914, when she was ten both her parents resigned from the SPD, horrified by the decision of the party leadership in the Reichstag (national parliament) to vote in favour of war credits to help finance the war which had broken out in July. That decision was contentious with many party members; and by the time the war ended four years later had led to a party split and thereby, indirectly, the launch of the Communist Party of Germany During December/January 1918/1919. Her parents joined the Communist Party in 1920. Ella and her siblings joined the Young Communists. = Work and qualification = 1918 was the year in which she left school and went to work in the children's ward at a nearby hospital and, later, at as a domestic assistant at a sanatorium. When she had been younger she had planned to become a teacher, and now she was keen to train and qualify for a career in nursing, but both options were closed off to her by the absence of the necessary funds in the family. Nevertheless, her extensive hands-on experience of childcare would later prove invaluable for her subsequent career in the care sector and, after 1928, in politics. In 1922 a \\"free place\\" came up for a traineeship as a Kindergarten teacher and registered children's nurse: she grabbed her opportunity. = Barkenhoff = Following qualification, Schimpf worked between 1924 and 1928 at the Barkenhoff in Worpswede, a small town set in the flat marshlands to the north of Bremen that had become home to a lively artistic community since the end of the 19th century. The Barkenhoff was a large detached house that had been acquired by the artist-turned-pacifist Heinrich Vogeler in 1894, and which after the First World War was made available by its owner to \\"Red Aid\\", a communist led workers' welfare organisation with well-publicised links to its Moscow based sister organisation (\\"–ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æÃÅ–¥–Ω–∞—è –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞ÃÅ—Ü–∏—è –ø–æÃÅ–º–æ—â–∏ –±–æ—Ä—Ü–∞ÃÅ–º —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—éÃÅ—Ü–∏–∏\\" / –ú–û–ü–†). Red Aid reconfigured the house for use as a rehabilitation home for the children of killed Communist activists and those who had been arrested and detained in the aftermath of the uprisings in the ports and industrial cities during 1918/19. Other sources emphasize the extent to which many of the children looked after in The Barkenhoff were \\"half- orphans\\" (the children of war-widow mothers) and children from families in which the fathers had been too badly wounded in the war to be able to find work and provide for their own children. According to at least one source the Barkenhoff children's home was organised on a \\"collective\\" basis. Elsewhere it is stated that Ella Schimpf/Ehlers was placed in overall charge of it in 1926 and ran it for the next two years. = A very political marriage = It was through the highly politicised children's home at which she worked that in 1926 Ella Schimpf met Adolf Ehlers (1898‚Äì1978). Ehlers was a prominent member of the Communist Party and the newly appointed secretary of \\"Red Aid\\". The two of them quickly formed an intense personal relationship which, as matters turned out, would become life-long. They married at some point between 1928 and 1935: sources differ. The marriage would remain childless. By the time the Ehlers relocated to Berlin in 1928 they were both committed members of the Communist Party which was itself - not for the first time - in a state of intensifying inner turmoil. = Party ructions = In 1929 Ella Ehlers took over the direction of a MOPR (\\"International Red Aid\\") children's home in Elgersburg, in the countryside south of Erfurt in Thuringia, from where every two months she visited her husband who had remained in Berlin. Over the next couple of years she became caught up in the backwash from the ferocious party ructions of the period, both on account of her husband and on her own account. Ever since Ernst Th√§lmann had become party leader in 1925 there had been a drive from the top for the Communist Party of Germany to align itself more closely - and some thought ever more unquestioningly - with the uncompromising anti-Trotskyite \\"hardline\\" version of communism which by this time was being propounded and implemented by the Soviet party under Stalin. One result of this in Germany was an unbending hostility to the centre-left Social Democratic Party, which contributed to a division on the political left of German politics that would prove disastrous in the build-up to 1933. Adolf and Ella Ehlers had relocated to Berlin, and Adolf Ehlers had remained there, in order that he might undertake an important job as national head of the propaganda department for \\"Red Aid\\". Sources indicate that his appointment to the job took effect during or shortly after 1927. However, by 1929 he was becoming increasingly estranged from the Stalinist party leadership, and when the party split during 1929/30 he was one of a large number of senior comrades who ended up as members of the so-called Communist Party of Germany (Opposition), which in the short term sought (unsuccessfully) to replace the \\"mainstream\\" Communist Party. Ella Ehlers had no difficulty in backing her husband and the other members of the break-away party. Sources are not entirely clear about the chronology of the next couple of years, but during or before 1930 Adolf Ehlers lost his job as head of the propaganda with \\"Red Aid\\". Ella Ehlers was having her own problems at Elgersburg with the Comintern \\"permanent representative\\" to Germany, Elena Stasova and with Erna Halbe who had been parachuted in by the party leadership to join her as co-leader at the MOPR children's home. In or before 1931 Ella Ehlers was removed from her position at the children's home and expelled from the party. = Back to Bremen = The Ehlers now moved back to Bremen where in the immediate term they now lived with Ella's older sister Grete Deisen and her husband Wilhelm, who had their home in the Osternburger Street near the city centre. Wilhelm Deisen was a fellow Communist activist who, like the Ehlers, had broken away from the \\"mainstream\\" party. Neither of the Ehlers was able to find work, and they stayed with the Deisen's, accommodated in an improvised apartment in the attic, for longer than any of those involved might have anticipated. A particular difficulty was that Adolf Ehlers had fallen seriously ill. He remained unemployed for six and a half years. Ella Ehlers therefore trained and qualified for office work, after which she took a clerical job with a small Bremen coffee business. Subsequently or concurrently she also undertook typing and office work with the Bergolin paint factory. The proprietor was aware of her anti-government political views, but protected her. Throughout the middle 1930s, till 1938, Adolf and Ella Ehlers were entirely dependent on Ella's wages for putting food on the table. = Politics and resistance = During 1932 the couple joined the Socialist Workers' Party (\\"Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands\\" / SAPD), which had been formed the previous year by break-away former members of the SPD. With German politics increasingly spilling onto the streets as the political parties became ever more polarised, and with the Reichstag (national parliament) becoming gridlocked by the mutual contempt of the principal populist parties (and not helped by continuing refusal of the Communist Party to discuss any sort of parliamentary coalition or collaboration with anyone else), the SAPD was formed out of a fear that political division on the left was opening a path to power for populist nationalists of the right. It proved a prescient fear, and one with which the Ehlers identified. In Bremen most of the former communists who had switched to the (as matters turned out short-lived) KPD(O) as part of the party split of 1929/30 also switched over to the SAPD. In January 1933 the Hitler government seized the opportunity presented by the political gridlock to take power. The new government lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship Political activity (unless on behalf of the ruling National Socialists) was outlawed. \\"Red Aid\\" was banned as part of the Reichstag Fire Decree at the end of February 1933. The Ehlers by now had their own apartment which very soon became a secret meeting place for the now illegal political activity which they continued to undertake with party comrades. Resistance activism under a dictatorship tends to go unreported unless those who engage in it end up in court, in which case records of statements used for the trial often provide a relatively detailed version of what was done or at least alleged. Ella Ehlers appears never to have been caught. Sources recall that during the twelve years of the Hitler government she undertook (and according to at least one source organised) illegal courier work which kept SAPD comrades in touch with one another. Elsewhere it is recorded that she was involved in helping endangered female comrades to escape the country. In 1934 the underground SAPD made contact with the \\"Internationaler Sozialistischer Kampfbund\\" (loosely, \\"International Socialist Militant League\\"), an organisation of German socialists who had set up an exiled leadership group in Sweden. There was a regular exchange of documents involving the SAPD leader August Enderle who was based in Stockholm from 1934 and who evidently had access to a printing press. A communication channel was set up involving members of the International Transport Workers' Federation, working on the ships sailing between the Swedish parts and Bremen. In addition it is recorded that on at least two occasions Ella Ehlers herself made the trip from Berlin to Hamburg in order to meet a woman in a caf√© who gave her printed pamphlets for onward distribution in Germany.Grebing Helga (editor-compiler.) Lehrst√ºcke in Solidarit√§t: Briefe und Biographien deutscher Sozialisten 1945-1949, Stuttgart 1983, pp.48-53 & 327 -328 In connection with her courier work during the war years Ella Ehlers also established firm and lasting friendships both with Irmgard Enderle and with the future Berlin mayor and West German chancellor Willy Brandt, who after 1940 assumed an increasingly prominent role among the German socialist resistance activists based in Norway and Sweden. It is impossible to know how far the security services were aware of the extent of the illegal contacts that Adolf and Elly Ehlers sustained on behalf of the SAPD. Certainly their house was subjected to frequent and thorough searches and they themselves were burdened with a succession of checks and reporting requirements. They nevertheless seem to have avoided lengthy periods of detention. Despite his political record, in 1938 Adolf Ehlers finally managed to find work. He had already worked for the shipbuilders AG Weser between 1918 and 1923, and in 1938 the firm took him back. He immediately became known to those who wished and needed to know as a contact between the workforce and the \\"underground\\" anti-government resistance movement in Bremen. = After the war = Already in 1944 Adolf Ehlers was meeting regularly with Hermann Wolters of the Communist Party. Military defeat had been on the horizon ever since Germany's catastrophic military reverses at Stalingrad in 1942/43, and the men's conspiratorial meetings presumably included discussions of possible post-war options. Those meetings may also have played their part in persuading Adolf and Ella Ehlers to rejoin the Communist Party after War ended and the National Socialist dictatorship ended in May 1945. With no way of immediately organising elections in the rubble of the German cities and towns, The western occupying powers were nevertheless keen to restore the pre-Hitler democratic intuitions with a power balance that should as far as possible (and with the exception of National Socialist representation) reflect the political power balance in 1932/33, which was the last time that broadly democratic elections had taken place in a democratic Germany. In Bremen Adolf Ehlers and Hermann Wolters were nominated to represent the Communist Party in the Senate of Bremen. Adolf Ehlers continued to serve in the senate till 1963. Although most of north-western Germany was placed in the British occupation zone in 1945, Bremen was administered by the US occupation forces for logistical reasons connected with the need by the US military for a large port into which they could ship men and supplies to support their operations in the US occupation zone to the south. To the east lay the Soviet occupation zone. In the immediate post war period those with access to transport were able to move relatively freely between the four occupation zones, and in May 1946 Adolf Ehlers and Hermann Wolters together attended the Leipzig Trade Fair. During their visit they clashed bitterly with comrade Walter Ulbricht, who was emerging as the Soviet-backed leader of a new kind of German one-party dictatorship in the central region of Germany which between 1945 and 1949 was administered under Soviet military control. Political developments during April 1946 had recalled pre-war concerns across the west that the German communist party, like its new successor party in the Soviet zone, risked becoming nothing more than a proxy for Moscow's all-too traditional imperialist ambitions. Towards the end of May 1946 Adolf and Ella Ehlers switched their political allegiance to the Social Democratic Party. When local elections were held in October 1946 Adolf Ehlers won his seat as an SPD member of the \\"Bremen B√ºrgerschaft\\" (state parliament). Between 1945 and 1948 Adolf Ehlers served as Senator for Welfare. In 1947 Health was added to his senatorial portfolio. 1947 was also the year in which he was one of a small group of senators engaged in drafting a new state constitution for Bremen. He then served between 1948 and 1963 as Bremen Senator for the Interior, which made him one of the city's leading political figures during the \\"Wirtschaftswunder\\" years. = \\"Bremer Arbeiterhilfswerk\\" (AHW) = In addition to supporting her husband in his political role, Ella Ehlers undertook a number of major projects of her own. In August 1945 she co-founded and became deputy chair (\\"... zweite Vorsitzende\\") of the \\"Bremer Arbeiterhilfswerk\\" (AHW), a workers' welfare provider in which, at least in these early days, Communists and Social Democrats worked closely together. In the austerity of the immediate postwar years there were major programmes for distributing food, clothes, heating fuel and so-called \\"CARE-packages\\" to be planned and implemented. As part of the AHW operation she organised children's convalescence cures in the village of Lankenau, a short distance outside Bremen to the west. She organised sewing rooms for women who had no prospect of visiting shops to replace their families' worn out clothes and established another much needed programme which involved as necessary/possible sorting, cleaning, mending and redistributing donated second-hand clothes to those who needed them most urgently. Because of the extensive use that the US military were making of the extensive dock facilities, and the millions of US citizens whose parents or grandparents had emigrated via the port during the concluding decades of the nineteenth century, Bremen was already relatively well known in the United States, where a network of volunteer-based welfare charities had sprung up in response to the human tragedies in Europe of the war and its aftermath. Her friendship from their illegal contacts with SAPD activists who had been based in Stockholm during the war years had left Ella Ehlers with good contacts in Sweden. Swiss welfare organisations were also much in evidence in Germany during the immediate post-war years. Through these contacts Ella Ehlers took the initiative on behalf of the AHW of launching an international aid and welfare donations campaign in support of the many needy citizens of Bremen. From Sweden Irmgard Enderle sent additional \\"CARE- parcels\\". Other politically engaged Bremen citizens participating with particular energy in the poverty relief efforts of the AHW included Clara Jungmittag, Charlotte Niehaus, Helene Kaisen and Anna Stiegler. = \\"Kampfgemeinschaft gegen den Faschismus\\" (KGF) = On a more expressly political front Ella Ehlers was a founder member and leading activist in support of her husband in the Fight against Fascism Society (\\"Kampfgemeinschaft gegen den Faschismus\\" / KGF) set up during April/May 1945 by Adolf Ehlers and Hermann Wolters. Based in Bremen, the association had a membership of 6,500 by the end of May 1945. Always intended as a left-wing movement, it was in effect a joint project of the Communist and SPD (parties). However, by October 1945 it had become clear that for the communist members the KGF was in effect a device whereby the two parties might be merged and become a single left-wing party in Bremen and more broadly. The goal of political unity on the left in order to block any risk of a National Socialist revival was an attractive one, but the terms on which the communists wanted to engineer it seemed to involve domination by the Communist elements, taking direction from Moscow. The 1946 party merger in the Soviet zone and its brutally choreographed aftermath indicate that such fears were soundly based. Meanwhile on Bremen, in December 1945, all concerned agreed to the dissolution of the KGF, just seven months after its creation.Hendrik Bunke: Die KPD in Bremen. 1945‚Äì1968 PapyRossa, K√∂ln 2001, = \\"Arbeiterwohlfahrt\\" (AWO) = By 1947 much of the rubble had been cleared from the city, and following the departure of its communist members the \\"Bremer Arbeiterhilfswerk\\" decided to subsume itself into the national Workers' Welfare organisation (\\"Arbeiterwohlfahrt\\" / AWO. After that change took effect, in 1948, Ella Ehlers continued to play an important part in the AWO, accepting the chairmanship of its Bremen branch in 1961. She was intimately involved in setting up the \\"Nachbarschaftshaus am Ohlenhof\\" (subsequently renamed \\"Nachbarschaftshaus Helene Kaisen\\") in Bremen-Gr√∂pelingen. Funded principally by a single large donation from the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee (and including a 150,000 Mark donation from the Henry Ford Foundation), and opened in 1952, it is described in sources as \\"Bremen's first [US-style] community centre\\". Gr√∂pelingen was a central traditionally working class district of the city, particularly badly affected by the war. The choice of Bremen for the generous donation from North America is attributed to the excellent US contacts that Adolf and Ella Ehlers had established and cultivated. It was a major project, on which Ella Ehlers worked closely with Helene Kaisen, wife of Bremen's first post-war mayor, and chairwoman of the association committee that was set up to administer the funding. The Gr√∂pelingen Community Center was only the first in a succession of initiatives in which Ella Ehlers took a lead. These included mother and child homes, day- care centres for the elderly, home-care provision for the sick, \\"meals on wheels\\" provision and local recreation centres for the elderly. One of these, the Bremen-west social centre (\\"Sozialzentrum Bremer Westen\\"), inaugurated in December 1971, was renamed as the \\"Ella Ehlers centre\\" (\\"Ella-Ehlers-Haus\\") in 1991. It would appear that none of these later projects quite matched the Gr√∂pelingen Community Center in terms of the sheer scale of the ambition and vision involved, but they continue, in most cases, to flourish, providing a lasting tribute to a woman whose name will always be associated with implementing practical solutions to identified welfare needs in Bremen. In 1961 Ella Ehlers took over the leadership of the Bremen AWO from her political comrade and friend Charlotte Niehaus, chairing the organisation's regional committee till 1970 and its committee for the entire state (of which she had become chairwoman in 1964) till 1980. After that she continued to participate as honorary chairwoman almost till her death. = Final years = Adolf Ehlers died on 20 May 1978. The marriage had been a good one and there are indications that Ella Ehlers never fully recovered from the loss. The lawyer- politician Henning Scherf was a political ally to Adolf and Elly Ehlers who between 1995 and 2005 served as 6th President of the Senate and Mayor of Berlin. During the final part of Elly Ehlers' life he visited her a number of times. In his 2013 book \\"Altersreise\\" (loosely, \\"The journey through old age\\" he provides a remarkably clear summary of her life during those final weeks. She was in her mid-70s: she appeared fit and healthy, but was nevertheless becoming more withdrawn. She would still attend executive committee meetings of the Bremen AWO (of which she remained honorary president) if she was asked to do so, but no longer turned up uninvited. There were a few occasions on which Scherf himself persuaded her to accompany him to political events. As a young ambitious senator he enjoyed the kudos to be gained by turning up with \\"an old lady with such a biography\\". But on those occasions he was too preoccupied with her celebrity to notice that she was actually becoming more and more lonely. In the end Elly Ehlers hanged herself in her apartment. She tied a rope round her neck, fixed the other end round a heating pipe, and then jumped off the end of the bath on the edge of which she had been standing. There can be no certainty as to her motivation, but friends believe that the continuing grief over her husband's death seven years earlier and the knowledge that her eyesight was failing were both important factors.

In 1761 after her mother‚Äôs death de Barrenechea moved with her father to Valladolid and entered the monastery of Las Huelgas where she received her literary training. On 3 January 1775, de Barrenechea married Juan de Sahag√∫n de la Mata Linares, 1st Count of Carpio. In 1780, they moved to Barcelona as her husband was appointed a Mayor of the Royal Court of Barcelona. There de Barrenechea gave birth to two daughters, Mar√≠a Martina, who died as a child, and Francisca Javiera. After several years, her husband was promoted to Minister of the Royal Council of Orders and the family moved to Madrid. De Barrenechea belonged to the Basque Society (Sociedad Bascongada) and was one of the fourteen women who created the Board of Ladies, associated with the Matritense Economic Society (Sociedad Econ√≥mica Matritense), to which her husband belonged. She was close friends with the Malaga playwright and poet Mar√≠a Rosa G√°lvez, who dedicated a poem to her at her death: La noche. I sing in single verse to the memory of the Countess del Carpio. De Barrenechea wrote three plays: La Aya, Catalin and one more without a title. La Aya was written in early 1780s. Catalin is a neoclassic sentimental comedy that was published by an anonymous editor in Ja√©n in 1783. As a literary figure de Barrenechea was not much appreciated until Catalin was republished in 1998 by Ararteko. Few month before her death de Barrenchea became a model for Goya‚Äôs painting Portrait of the Marquise de la Solana which is currently kept in the Louvre Museum in Paris. De Barrenchea suffered from many illnesses, including tuberculosis. She died on 23 November 1795 in Madrid.

Sold to Baja Ferries in 2013 and renamed La Paz Star she sailed to the Pacific and served on routes along the northern part of the Western Mexican coast. She was sold again to Medferry Shipping in 2016 and the following year returned to European waters. After a refit she served on the Rhodes to Santorini route in Greek waters. She caught fire in June 2017 and, though saved, was afterwards scrapped in Turkey under the name Star.  Description  As built, the ship was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She was assessed at , , . She was powered by two Pielstick 12PC2-5V-400-V diesel engines rated at a total of giving a maximum speed of . She had accommodation for 12 passengers.  History  = Early career = The ship was built in 1978 as Merzario Espania for Stena Container Line's Merzario Line. She was constructed by Hyundai at their Ulsan, South Korea shipyard; her IMO number was 7528659. She first sailed in August 1978 and was later renamed Merzario Hispania. She was sold in 1980 to European Ferries who renamed her Nordic Ferry and operated her under their Townsend Thoresen brand. From December 1980 to February 1981 she was in the Hapag Lloyd Werft shipyards in Bremerhaven, Germany, undergoing jumboisation to increase passenger capacity. After rebuilding, she was assessed at , , . She was afterwards employed on the Felixstowe‚ÄìEuropoort route. = Falklands War = Nordic Ferry was in Europoort on 3 May 1982, preparing to sail for Felixstowe, when she was taken up from trade by the British government for service in the Falklands War. She sailed for the UK and from 4‚Äì9 May underwent an extensive refit for service as a troop and stores ship. Two helipads were installed on her top deck, made from thick steel. Landing aids and 102 helicopter tying-down points were also installed. A replenishment at sea mast with a fuel line was installed to her shelter deck, some of her bulwarks were removed and additional life rafts installed. Internally she was fitted with satellite communications with teleprinters, satellite navigation, additional galley equipment and a reverse osmosis freshwater plant. She displaced 6,455 tons and was capable of making . Together with sister ship and Sealink's St Edmund she carried personnel and equipment of the 5th Infantry Brigade and associated logistics support units. Her main deck was loaded with stores and equipment, at the bow were 15 rows of pallets of ammunition, stacked three-high, followed by six pallet rows of rations, eight of other equipment, containers of refrigerated goods and, at the stern, military vehicles. Since the stern door was the only access, almost everything else had to be unloaded to reach the ammunition. Nordic Ferry carried approximately half of the stores and many of the personnel of 10 Field Workshop, a maintenance support unit. The majority of their stores were never unloaded and remained on board for the duration of the war, the unit never being deployed in its main role and instead being used to guard Argentine prisoners of war. With Nordic Ferry, Baltic Ferry and St Edmund removed from service, capacity on the Harwich/Felixstowe to Holland routes was greatly reduced and Townsend Thoresen chartered two replacement vessels. Nordic Ferry sailed from Portsmouth on 9 May and carried out replenishment at sea and helicopter landing trials in The Solent. She afterwards proceeded to Freetown, Sierra Leone, and sailed in company with Baltic Ferry. The two vessels parted company on 29 May to proceed independently to the Falklands. After unloading her stores she was escorted eastwards by the frigate . On 8 July she picked up 85 Royal Marines from King Edward Point, South Georgia, taking them onboard from a tug backed up to her open stern ramp. Nordic Ferry sailed for the UK on 29 July and upon her arrival was refitted for commercial use, returning to service at Felixstowe on 25 August. In recognition of her service she was awarded the battle honour \\"Falkland Islands 1982\\". = Later career = Stena Transporter in Rotterdam June 2009 As Strada Corsa in Olbia August 2013 After the war Nordic Ferry continued on the Felixstowe‚ÄìEuropoort route. In 1985‚Äì86 she underwent a ¬£5 million refit at the Wilton-Fijenoord shipyard in Schiedam, the Netherlands, to fit her for combined passenger and freight use. She had 27 additional cabins installed, bringing her passenger capacity up to 124. Nordic Ferry afterwards replaced MS Super Viking on the Felixstowe‚ÄìZeebrugge route. She was assessed at , , . Townsend Thoresen was rebranded as P&O; European Ferries in 1987. On 4 February 1987, Nordic Ferry collided with the vessel San Salvador while travelling towards Felixstowe. The subsequent investigation found that San Salvador had proceeded at an unsafe speed of given she had an inoperable radar and visibility of only in poor weather. Although Nordic Ferry was proceeding faster, at , her speed was ruled safe given she was fitted with two excellent radar sets, had a high level of manoeuvrability and an experienced crew. Nordic Ferry was renamed Pride of Flanders by 1993 and in November 1995 was refitted at Harland and Wolff in Belfast to maximise her freight capacity. Following the refit, she was assessed at , . Her beam and depth were now and respectively. Pride of Flanders was sold to Stena Line in 2002 and her name shortened to Flanders, she was later renamed Stena Transporter. In June 2009 she was sold to Strade Blu and served on their Livorno to Olbia, Sardinia route, being renamed Strada Corsa. She was sold again in October 2013 to Baja Ferries and was sailed to the Pacific to service their La Paz to Topolobampo and Mazatl√°n routes in Mexico, during which time she was named La Paz Star. Sold to Medferry Shipping in December 2016 she returned to Europe, traversing the Panama Canal in January 2017 and passing Gibraltar in February. Renamed Med Star, a major refit was carried out to her car decks and stern ramp. She afterwards served on the Rhodes to Santorini route in Greece under charter to Blue Star Ferries and sailing under the Cypriot flag. Having loaded 33 vehicles at Rhodes on 15 June 2017 she suffered a fire in her engine room that spread to the accommodation block. Twenty of her passengers and crew were evacuated in a lifeboat and, after the remaining twelve crew managed to extinguish the fire, Med Star was towed to Rhodes. She was transferred to the Spanopoulos repair yard in Perama but repairs proved uneconomic. Renamed Star and sailing under the Sierra Leonean flag, she was beached at Aliaƒüa, Turkey, for breaking on 8 December 2017. At the time of scrapping her length was measured at .

She is the author of the well-reviewed work of Colombian, Brazilian, and West African histories Fugitive Modernities: Kisama and the Politics of Freedom, about the Qui√ßama people, at home in Angola and within diaspora, especially in Brazil. The book was a finalist for the Frederick Douglass Prize and the Harriet Tubman Prize. Krug's additional studies focus on African American history and Latin America. According to Krug, her principal focus has been in advocacies on behalf of people of color as well as in anti-gentrification activism. She has published essays in Essence and at the race-exploring website RaceBaitR. Krug was an associate professor of history at George Washington University (GWU) (2012-2020) until becoming the focus of controversy after she disclosed in an essay that she had lived for years under assumed racial and ethnic identities (including that of being half-Algerian-American and half-German-American and of being a Bronx- bred Afro-\\"boricua\\" (Afro-Puerto Rican) who went by the self-described \\"salsa\\" name of \\"La Bombalera\\"). In a September 3 2020 blog post, Krug confessed that: \\"I have eschewed my lived experience as a white Jewish child in suburban Kansas City under various assumed identities within a Blackness that I had no right to claim: first North African Blackness, then US rooted Blackness, then Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness.\\" Krug has taken financial support from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture that led to her book, Fugitive Modernities. In 2009, she was awarded a $45,000 Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad Fellowship. Early years and personal life Krug - who pronounces her surname Cruz ( or , or ‚Äîin General American) - grew up in a Jewish family in Overland Park, Kansas, in the Kansas City metropolitan area. She graduated from The Barstow School, a co-ed private college prep school in south Kansas City. She later attended the University of Kansas as a white woman. In her September 2020 blog post, Krug said she had \\"been battling some unaddressed mental health demons for my entire life\\" and, to escape from unspecified emotional \\"issues\\" and \\"severe trauma\\", began passing as a light-skinned person of color in her youth. Krug, who taught university classes in the Washington D.C. area, is known to have an apartment in East Harlem in New York City. According to Krug, she has been a part-time dance instructor.  Works  = Fugitive Modernities = Krug's book, Fugitive Modernities, was well-received among peers after publication in 2018. In it, Krug engages in a \\"rigorous examination of identity formation\\" of Kisama, a mountainous region in Angola that became a destination for those fleeing the slave trade in the late 16th century. Krug's intellectual history of Kisama was \\"impressive in its breadth of research\\" and gave scholars different ways of thinking about how Africans influenced Black people elsewhere around the world. It was also the first history of the Kisama region. Krug argued that \\"Kisama allows us to imagine a more humane and less brutalized form of interpersonal relationship in which the structures erected by states to constrain us are overcome in favor of shared liberation.\\" = Fathers of No Nation = Fathers of No Nation, Krugs's work in progress, is slated to focus on \\"gendered politics of authority and state in S√£o Tom√©, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica from the sixteenth century through the present.\\" = Publications = Books * * Journal article & book chapters   Academic scandal  Medium blogpost = Discrepancies among ethnic claims over time = Prior to Krug's 2020 admission in the essay, one junior scholar noticed that ethnicities of which Krug claimed had changed from being part- Algerian-part-German to Afro-Puerto Rican. Word of this discrepancy reached Yomaira C. Figueroa-V√°squez, an associate professor of Afro-diaspora studies at Michigan State University, who, upon researching the matter, discovered that Krug was from Kansas City and born to parents who were white and Jewish. = Aftermath = Hari Ziyad, the editor-in-chief of RaceBaitr, a website where Krug had published articles, said she had only come forward with the revelation of her ethnic deceptions because they had been discovered by others and was about to be made public against her wishes. \\"She didn't do it out of benevolence,\\" they said. \\"She did it because she had been found out.\\" Similarly, Michigan State University assistant professor Yomaira C. Figueroa believed that pending public revelations of Krug's true racial identity prompted her confession. GWU spokesperson Crystal Nosal said in emails to news organizations that the university was \\"aware of the post\\" and \\"looking into the situation\\". GWU's department of history asked Krug to resign her tenured professorship, saying that \\"With her conduct, Dr. Krug has raised questions about the veracity of her own research and teaching.\\" GWU cancelled her classes after the scandal. On September 9, 2020, GWU confirmed that Krug had resigned from the university. Assistant professor of global diaspora studies at Michigan State University Yomaira Figueroa, believing that Krug \\"took up some of the very few ‚Äî very few ‚Äî resources and spaces that there are available to Black and Latino scholars and use those to her advantage,\\" said to a reporter that she calls for there \\"to be a form of restitution for the things that she [Krug] took. It's egregious.\\" Duke University Press, the publisher of Krug's Fugitive Modernities, said that all proceeds from her book will be donated to a fund that will assist Black and Latinx scholars. = Commentary = Michigan State University's Yomaira Figueroa and Hunter College's Yarimar Bonilla, writing in an op-ed, labeled Krug's various cultural appropriations a current form of minstrelsy. Figueroa told reporters, \\"The very first night that I learned about it, I couldn't sleep, because I just thought how awful it was that someone was perpetrating this identity, but not only that. Kind of preying on the white imagination, and pulling from some of the worst stereotypes that there are about black people and Puerto Rican people, and using that as a cloak for her identity\\" (referring to revelations that Krug had falsely claimed that her parents had been drug addicts and her mother a sex worker). Illinois State University's Tour√© F. Reed believes that Krug did not appropriate legitimate black culture but rather, within a \\"minstrel act\\", its \\"racist caricature.\\" Welcome2theBronx journalist Ed Garc√≠a Conde wrote that Krug was once a salsa teacher of a friend, and that he had once seen her dancing salsa at a festival in East Harlem with a Puerto Rican flag hanging from her shorts. Garcia Conde is of the view that Krug's identification of herself as Afro Latina led her to gain grants and opportunities, thus denying them from others. \\"How many grants and opportunities did she steal by passing as such? How many other real Afro Latinas missed out on a crucial opportunity to advance their careers because of this vulture appropriating a culture that is not hers?\\" Doctoral candidate Lisa Betty of Fordham University wrote in a blogpost, \\"Krug took up space, opportunity, time, and money. I call for reparations.\\"  See also  * Racial misrepresentation * Passing (racial identity) * Blackfishing ** Soul Man (film)#Controversy * List of impostors ** H. G.

He is currently Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and is the Cupola Era Professor in the College of Chemistry. His research considers charge transport and interfacial charge transfer in two-dimensional materials and heterostructures.  Early life and education  Bediako was born in Accra, Ghana to Kwame Bediako, a Ghanaian, and Gillian Mary Bediako, British. He grew up in Akropong, Ghana, but also spent portions of his childhood in Edinburgh. Bediako was a student at the Akosombo International School through elementary and high school. During his time at high school Bediako became interested in chemistry. In 2004 he moved to the United States, for college where he joined Calvin University as an undergraduate student. At Calvin University Bediako did research with Douglas Vander Griend, an inorganic chemistry professor, and became interested in inorganic coordination chemistry. He graduated with honors in 2008, and joined UOP LLC to study new catalysts for industrial applications. After a year in industry, Bediako moved to the East Coast, where he joined the laboratory of Daniel G. Nocera at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bediako eventually earned his master's degree at MIT, where he worked on mechanistic studies of water splitting electrocatalysis, and the development of metal catalysts for solar energy storage. At MIT he also worked on devices that use electricity from photovoltaic cells to generate hydrogen than can be used in fuel cells, and was part of the team who developed the components of the artificial leaf; a device which makes use of bacteria to convert solar energy into a liquid fuel. When Nocera moved to Harvard University, Bediako joined him, and completed his doctoral research on the catalytic behavior of structurally disordered first row transition metal oxides.  Research and career  After completing his doctorate, Bediako remained at Harvard University as a postdoctoral research fellow in Philip Kim's group. Here he looked at quantum transport through two- dimensional van der Waals heterostructures. Here he focussed on isolating ultra-thin layers of materials and precisely positioning them into a super- structure. By stacking materials in such a way, and embedding lithium ions between the individual layers, Bediako showed that it was possible to engineer higher electrochemical capacities. In 2018 Bediako started a faculty position at the University of California, Berkeley. He has been awarded an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award, a United States Air Force Young Investigator Award and a United States Department of Energy Early Career Award.  Select publications   * *  Personal life  Bediako's older brother, Timothy Yaw Bediako, received a PhD in immunology and works as a principal investigator at the West African Center for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens (WACCBIP).

She is the Medical Director of Supportive Care at Ohio State's Comprehensive Cancer Center and President Elect of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer. Lustberg is also an associate editor for the peer-reviewed medical journal covering oncology nursing with respect to cancer survivors called Journal of Cancer Survivorship. Early life and education Lustberg was born in Iran but moved to Maryland with her family at the age of 10. She attended the University of Maryland for her undergraduate degree where she completed a double major in biochemistry and English. She eventually chose to pursue medicine after completing a research rotation at the NCI. From there, Lustberg earned her Medical Degree from the University of Maryland School of Medicine and completed her fellowship in Hematology/Oncology at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. In the final year of her medical school, she married her fiance Mark Lustberg and both were recruited to Ohio State University (OSU). Career During her tenure at OSU, Lustberg has focused on researching \\"physicians‚Äô and patients‚Äô perspectives on cancer survivorship care, prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and early detection of chemotherapy induced cardiotoxicity in breast cancer survivors\\". While working as a breast medical oncologist at The James Cancer Hospital in 2011, Lustberg was involved in a clinical trial aimed at finding a better way to assess early cardiac injury. The following year, she was part of a research team which used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and heart health biomarkers in breast cancer patients to identify which patients were more likely to suffer from cardiac issues. She also received an Idea Grant from Pelotonia to fund her study on breast cancer patients‚Äô chemotherapy-induced cognitive deficits. Using the grant, Lustberg and her research team investigated whether social isolation and feelings of loneliness could reduce a female cancer patients PTEN level, causing a cancer progression. In 2017, Lustberg conducted a study which observed how chemotherapy treatment severely impacted patients walking gait and balance, leading to a greater risk of falls. To reach this conclusion, her team followed 33 patients with stage I-III breast cancer through three months post-treatment. She was subsequently recognized by Forbes magazine as one the United States' exemplary physician in breast cancer oncology. The following year, Lustberg began studying the relationship between Omega-3 fatty acid and joint pain caused by cancer treatment. She has investigated whether Omega-3 fatty acids found that the avid could be used as a preventive measure for joint pain rather than an intervention. Lustberg also received funding from the Alliance NCORP Research Base for her collaborative research project titled \\"Curcumin for Breast Cancer Survivors with Aromatase Inhibitor-induced Joint Arthropathy: A Randomized Double-blinded Controlled Pilot Study.\\" In 2020, Lustberg became the President Elect of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer. She was also named by the magazine Columbus Monthly as one of the top doctors in central Ohio.

The monumental statue in the center of the plaza, dedicated to president Gerardo Barrios, was made by Francisco Durini and inaugurated in 1909. The project for the monument was conceived by brothers Antonio and Carlos Ezeta, with participation of educator Rafael Reyes. The statue, cast in bronze, shows an equestrian statue of the military leader. The statue is placed on a pedestal of granite that shows battle scenes cast in bronze and the coat of arms of El Salvador. The plaza is an important point of reference for the salvadoran capital because it is surrounded by emblematic structures such as the National Palace and the Metropolitan Cathedral. It has also been the scene of various historic moments, such as: * The assassination attempt against president Manuel Araujo (1865‚Äì1913), on 4 February 1913, when four men attacked him with machetes. The president died five days later. * The disturbances in 30 March 1980 during the funeral of archbishop √ìscar Romero, assassinated 6 days earlier during a mass. * The celebration of the end of the Civil War, on 2 February 1992. * The presidential inauguration of the 2019 presidential election, leaving Nayib Bukele as president of the republic for the period of 2019‚Äì2024. In 1999, the plaza was remodeled during the administration of mayor H√©ctor Silva, and once more in 2012 during Norman Quijano's administrations, during which a fountain and a ceramic floor was added. Currently, the plaza is the site of distinct activities of public and religious interest; it is the principal site for the celebration of the patron saint San Salvador during august, since it is where the procesion dedicated to the Divine Savior of the World ends, typically called \\"la bajada\\". It is also the site of parades.  Historical antecedents  Statue of Capit√°n General Gerardo Barrios ‚Äì San Salvador, 1915 In 1566 the convent of Santo Domingo was moved to the site that is now occupied by the Metropolitan Cathedral, the empty lot in front of the convent came to be known as the \\"Plaza de Santo Domingo\\". En el ejemplar de El Constitucional del 25 de octubre de 1866 se public√≥ que el presidente hab√≠a tocado la necesidad de un parque en la capital y que ser√≠a una de sus obras inmediatas. By December 1867, it was reported that foreign imported lamps were to be placed in the Plaza de Santo Domingo and that the same plaza would be the first to receive trees in its perimeter as well as benches; it was also projected that a poplar park was to be constructed after the conclusion of the facade of the first National Palace. By this year as well, the plaza began to be known as the \\"Plaza Central\\" or \\"Plaza Principal\\" after the remodelling efforts by the Spanish general Luis P√©rez G√≥mez. By mid-January 1868, the official government journal, El Constitucional, reported that the plaza was to be known as the Plaza de Armas and implored that beautification works would begin. By the end of the month, the atrium of the Iglesia de Santo Domingo was being surrounded by iron guardrails, a work administered by presbyters don Felipe Novales and don Ysac Paz. In 1875 a kiosk was erected. In 1884 the plaza was paved, by this time the plaza was known as \\"Plaza Bol√≠var\\"; seven years later, the plaza was lit by electric light bulbs for the first time.

Taxonomy  The genus Kiwalges was erected by Gaud and Atyeo in 1970 to contain two species of kiwi feather mites, K. palametrichus and K. phalagotrichus. These species are found on brown kiwi (Apteryx australis), little spotted kiwi (A. owenii), and great spotted kiwi (A. haastii). Gaud and Atyeo noted that these species, and two others they described in the genus Kiwilichus, were not host specific so did not shed much light on the evolutionary origins of the different kiwi species, but no other species in this subfamily had been found on any other ratite birds. Since then feather mites have been found on most ratite species. In 1985, Dallas Bishop described a fifth species of kiwi feather mite from specimens all found on A. haastii. Six came from a kiwi collected near the Totara River, 20 from a Smyth River specimen, and two more from Madman Creek, all in Westland. She named the species Kiwalges haastii, using the same specific epithet as the great spotted kiwi, which honours Canterbury Museum director Julius von Haast. Slide-mounted holotype of Kiwialges haastii  Description  Kiwalges haastii females are of average size for a feather mite, about 360 ¬µm long and 186 ¬µm wide; males are about 300 ¬µm long and 167 ¬µm wide. They are distinguished from the other two Kiwalges species by the positioning of setae on their third leg, the absence of a tubercle on their second leg, and the shape of their propodosomal shield.  Biology  Little is known of this species' biology, but the tick Ixodes anatis also infests kiwi, living in the stable microclimate of a nesting burrow and roughly synchronising its hatching with months when young kiwi are still present in the nest. Feather mites do not suck the blood of their host, but feed on feathers and skin flakes. Some species feed on the preening oil secreted from the uropygial gland, but kiwi have no such gland, so Kiwalges haastii probably feeds on the feathers themselves. Feather mites in other birds can cause some feather damage and skin lesions, but there is no evidence that they are harmful to kiwi. Kiwialges haastii seems to be the only host-specific (monoxenous) species of kiwi mite.  Notes  References  External links  * Kiwalges haastii discussed in RNZ Critter of the Week, 4 Sept 2020.

After graduating with a nursing degree in 1922, she worked as a supervising nurse and headed the educational department for the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City. She worked as a hospital inspector for the state of Utah until 1928, when she moved to San Francisco to attend medical school. While earning her degree at the University of California, San Francisco, she worked as a nurse in the Bay Area. Upon her graduation in 1932, she moved to the Philippines, where she opened a medical practice. During World War II, she volunteered as a civilian surgeon for the United States Army. She was stationed in Baguio and was responsible for the care of nearly 30 soldiers, when the rest of the Army retreated to the Bataan Peninsula. Taken prisoner in 1941, she was held in three internment camps before being liberated. Returning to the United States, she resumed her practice in the Bay Area. She was awarded the Medal of Freedom in 1946. In 1960, she moved her practice to Provo, Utah, where she served as dean of the Brigham Young University College of Nursing until 1964. Allen retired in 1979 and in that year married and relocated to Mesa, Arizona, where she lived until her death in 1989. Early life and education Beulah Estelle Ream was born on January 26, 1897, in Dingle, Idaho, to Nora Ellen (n√©e Crockett) and William Dewine Ream. She was raised on her father's farm with a large family of siblings including: William Wesley (1886), Mitchell Alvin (1888), Lee Emerson (1890), Fabian Dewine (1891), Ida Nora (1893), George Douglas (1895), John Rodney (1900), Milton Parke (1901) and Kenneth Durward (1903). She attended public schools and graduated from the Academy of Idaho in 1916 with teaching credentials. She began teaching in 1917, but the outbreak of the 1918 flu epidemic led her to enroll in nursing school at the (program merged in 1926 into the University of Chicago's School of Nursing and ceased to exist in 1929). She completed her registered nurse requirements in 1922. Career =Nursing and further education (1922‚Äì1932)= After her graduation in 1922, Ream moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, where she worked at the LDS Hospital as a supervising nurse until 1923. She then served as head of the education department until 1925 and worked as a nurse, before becoming a hospital inspector for the State of Utah between 1927 and 1928. Keen to improve her ability to assist her patients, Ream decided to return to school to become a physician and completed her bachelor's degree in 1928 at the University of Utah. She then transferred to the University of California, San Francisco, where she worked as a nurse in the Bay Area until earning her Doctor of Medicine degree in 1932. She completed her internship at the Women's and Children's Hospital of San Francisco. =Physician in the Philippines (1933‚Äì1945)= Upon her graduation, Ream traveled to the Philippines to visit her brother Fabian and his family. In addition to setting up a private practice in Manila, from 1934 she served as the chief medical officer of the Mary Johnston Hospital. In 1937, she married Major Henderson Wilcox \\"Sam\\" Allen, a U.S. Army officer from Kentucky. In 1940, their son Lee was born. Although she could have been evacuated because of the impending Japanese invasion of the Philippines, Allen chose to remain with her husband. He received a medical discharge in December 1941, but, before the family could leave, the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred and Sam was called back to active duty. Santo Tomas Internment Camp Liberation, 1945 On December 8, 1941, Japanese bombers began an air raid at Baguio in the Philippines, where the Allens had made their home. Establishing a makeshift hospital to care for the wounded, Allen volunteered her services to the Army as a civilian physician- surgeon. When the rest of the army retreated to the Bataan Peninsula, she was responsible for the care of nearly 30 soldiers. After the Battle of Bataan, her husband was captured and forced to make the Bataan Death March. He died in the Cabanatuan Internment Camp without seeing his family again. Allen was captured in late 1941 and initially interned with her son at Camp John Hay. She worked as part of the medical staff at the camp hospital. On April 20, 1942, they were moved by bus with other westerners to Camp Holmes Internment Camp, where her second son, Henderson Rey, was born on July 4, 1942. As before, Allen worked in the camp hospital, but had a difficult relationship with its head, Dr. Dana Nance. Allen pressed for improved sanitation controls to limit the cases of dysentery and disease among the camp chickens, suggesting that all garbage be buried. She pushed for the isolation of new internees until it could be determined if they had communicable diseases. Nance ignored her suggestions, as well as her recommendation for the staff to move outside of the hospital so that the patients were not housed in tents. Conditions in the camp were poor and inadequate food supplies often led to malnutrition. Allen gave yeast supplements to the patients to improve their health. Frustrated that women were not allowed to vote on the General Committee that operated the camp, Allen organized a Women's Committee and demanded that the General Committee include both men and women in camp governance. The committee polled the prison population, and though Allen's proposal won the majority of votes, the General Committee ignored the result and maintained a men-only voting policy. Eventually all of Allen's proposals were adopted at the camp, but she was no longer there to see the result. After 18 months of captivity, she asked for a transfer and took her boys to the Santo Tomas Internment Camp, where there was a shortage of physicians, in early 1943. Conditions at Santo Tomas were dire. By 1943, the shortages of drugs, sheets, blankets, mosquito nets and other basic supplies impacted the ability to treat patients. Relief supplies did not arrive until December 1943, requiring doctors to search for substitute medical treatments, but were again at critical shortage levels by the end of 1944 and starvation was a serious problem. There was no food source or regular supply of food, except from the Red Cross. Though obligated to feed the prisoners, the Japanese commandant was unable to secure adequate funds. The General Committee asked for 55 cents per person per day, but the authorities were willing to grant only 35 cents. By late 1944, food supplies were so scarce that inmates were eating vegetable peelings, and the garbage disposal crews became obsolete. When Allen arrived, she was appointed to several committees and at various times headed the camp's children's hospital. She was assigned to serve both the children‚Äôs hospital and the isolation hospital along with D. Chambers, F. O. Smith, and Evelyn M. Withoff. In addition to her appointment on the Medical Board, Allen served on the Food Committee, Committee on Releases to Outside Hospitals, and Public Health Committee and was elected to the Parents' Association Board. On February 3, 1945, the camp was liberated by American troops. Within a few weeks, the Allen family were headed back to the United States, arriving in San Francisco on March 30, 1945. Allen was awarded the Medal of Freedom (later known as the Presidential Medal of Freedom) by General Douglas MacArthur. In 1947, she accepted the Soldier's Medal and Bronze Star Medal on behalf of her husband's service. =Later career (1945‚Äì1979)= Allen, Dean of Nursing, 1962 Allen re-established her medical practice in California. Initially, she worked with her brother Dr. Milton P. Ream, who lived in San Leandro and saw patients in Oakland. She established a home for her sons and her mother in San Francisco and worked in San Francisco, Cupertino, and Palo Alto. She returned to the University of California, taking post-graduate courses. In 1960, she was hired as the dean of the Brigham Young University College of Nursing and moved to Provo, Utah. After four years in the post, she returned to private practice until her retirement in 1979. That year, at the age of 82, she married Joseph Smith Jarvis and moved to Mesa, Arizona. Death and legacy She died on March 17, 1989, in Mesa. Her funeral was held March 20 at the Oak Hills 4th Ward Chapel in Provo, before she was interred at the Golden Gate National Cemetery, in San Bruno, California.

She is buried in Westminster Abbey. Godolphin School is named after her. Life Her birth date is unknown but she was baptised in 1663 in Coulston in Wiltshire. Her parents were Elizabeth and Francis Godolphin. Her mother's father was John Gayer who had been a Lord Mayor of London. Her mother died in childbirth when she was about four and her father remarried but died when she was seven. He had built what became Baynton House in Coulston. Her uncle, Sir William Godolphin became the guardian to her and her brother Francis. Their father had left them an annuity but the bulk of the estate went to his eldest child, William, who was Elizabeth's brother. William died in a duel in 1682 and her brother inherited but Francis took his own life in 1702. She married her cousin so her family name remained as Godolphin. She and her cousin and husband Charles Godolphin received a large inheritance. Her husband was a Member of Parliament and they lived at St James's Street in Piccadilly. They adopted a relative, Frances (Fanny) Quicke, after their only two children both died young. Godolphin School was founded by her using her own money and some from the estate of her husband, the Hon. Charles Godolphin. She created the school originally for the education of eight young orphaned gentlewomen. According to the terms of her will, the students were to be daughters of members of the Church of England, between eight and twelve years of age, born in Salisbury or some other part of Wiltshire, and to have had \\"some portion left to them but not exceeding ¬£400\\". The girls were to be taught to \\"dance, work, read, write, cast accounts and the business of housewifery\\". The new charity was initially to be administered by her nephew William Godolphin and his heirs, The Dean and Chapter declined to take on the task. The school did not open its doors until 9 August 1784, when it was based in Rosemary Lane, in the Cathedral Close, Salisbury. In 1789 the school promised a regime of early rising, \\"agreeable exercise\\" and a diet of wholesome books \\"such as enlarge the heart to Virtue and excellency of Sentiment\\".Prospectus by the headmistress, Mrs Voysey, in 1789 Death and legacy The school dates its foundation to 1726, the date of Godolphin's death. She was buried in Westminster Abbey, joining her husband and their dead children. The inscription records the terms of her will as set out above. Her husband died several years before this bequest was made. Every other year, in November, Godolphin School commemorates its founder Elizabeth Godolphin when the Head Girl, accompanied by members of the Upper Sixth, lay a wreath on her tomb in the cloister of Westminster Abbey. Godolphin School makes available substantial contribution to the fees of some students as part of their founder's legacy.

Kearney of Foreign Affairs said the essays \\"put Piketty‚Äôs arguments into a broad historical and intellectual context and highlight some noteworthy omissions that call into question his book‚Äôs most dire predictions.\\" She lauded the collection as \\"an intellectual excursion of a kind rarely offered by modern economics.\\" However, she said that the contributors overly assume wealthy elites will maintain high positions regardless of left-wing policies and that contributors \\"do not explore those potential policies at great length, nor do they consider the precise mechanisms that would shape pushback from the elites.\\" Kearney described the Brexit vote and Trump's election as evidence against the view that elites can overcome support for more wealth redistribution. Paschal Donohoe of The Irish Times stated that \\"despite its size, this collection misses so much.\\" Donohoe said that the collection's editors fail to be impartial by describing critics' arguments as substance-free, and that there has been potent criticism of Piketty concerning \\"whether laws can exist in economics, whether the digital economy disrupts the accumulation and transfer of wealth, and even whether Piketty confuses wealth with capital.\\" Donohoe also argued, \\"I do not believe that inequality is inevitable.

History  In August 2001, HBO announced the blocks Jam and Magnet for their family channel, HBO Family, both of which first began on August 26, 2001. Magnet's initial programming lineup was 30 by 30: Kid Flicks, The Adventures of Tintin, Animated Tales of The World, Crashbox, Dear America, and The Worst Witch. Later on, Jam and HBO Family's programming were added on Magnet's lineup like The Little Lulu Show, Freshman Year, and What Matters. In 2004, the block moved its timeslot to 1:30pm and runs until 3:30pm. When this happened, some of the programming was dropped and was replaced with a full hour of Crashbox. Also during this time, Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child moved its place from Jam to Magnet. The only show that survived this change was The Little Lulu Show, a show that also aired on Jam. By late 2004, the block dropped its own branding, leaving it unbranded. In January 2005, the block was entirely removed from HBO Family's lineup. Due to this, this caused Animated Tales of the World and Crashbox to move to Jam, while the former did not last long there, the latter still airs to this day, as Jam is now known as HBO Kids.

Beckbury Camp, half a mile north of the hamlet, is an Iron Age univallate hillfort. St Faith's chapel in the hamlet dates back to Saxon times. Farmcote was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, in the form Fernecote. The toponym is derived from the Old English fearn \\"fern\\" and cot \\"cottage\\", and so means \\"fern cottage(s)\\". In the Middle Ages Hailes Abbey held land here, and built Farmcote Grange, the remains of which are still visible. In 1314 Stephen de Stratford was granted lordship of Farmcote Manor, and his Stratford family descendants held the manor until the estate was sold in 1756. Following the dissolution of Hailes Abbey in 1539 the Farmcote Stratfords occupied Great Farmcote Manor House. The manor house, still bearing the arms of the Stratford family, is now a Grade II listed building. Farmcote became a chapelry of the parish of Guiting Power (also known as Lower Guiting), but in 1883 was transferred to the civil parish of Pinnock and Hyde.

It embodies the three theological virtues of Christianity: faith (represented by tridents of gardians on a Christian cross), hope (represented by the anchor of sinners), and charity (represented by the heart of the The Three Marys).  Background  The poet Joseph d'Arbaud with a gardian's trident The Camargue cross was designed in 1926 by the painter-illustrator Hermann-Paul (1864‚Äì1940), at the request of his friend the marquis-writer-manadier Folco de Baroncelli (1869‚Äì1943), considered to be the \\"Inventor\\" of the Camargue. After having founded the Nacioun Gardiano association in 1904, in order to \\"maintain and glorify the costume, customs and traditions of the country of Arles, the Camargue and the bullfighting countries\\", he was inspired by the naval anchors to represent with this cross the \\"Camargue nation\\" of herdsmen and fishermen. The marquess- writer-manadier Folco de Baroncelli (1869‚Äì1943) The poet Joseph d'Arbaud carried a gardian's trident made in wrought iron for him by Joseph Barbanson, a blacksmith from Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, in his workshop at Place de la R√©volution (now Place du Grenier √† Sel). It was d'Arbaud who suggested replacing the three fleur-de-lis (on a cross anchory) that were planned with camargue tridents) as a symbol of the region. The statue was inaugurated by the Committee of Friends of the Marquis de Baroncelli on July 7, 1926, in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer on a platform next to the post office (opposite the current \\"Grand Large\\" building). During this celebration, many personalities, including the Marquis de Baroncelli and his friends, were present: the poet Joseph d'Arbaud, Rul d'Elly, Maguy Hugo (granddaughter of Victor Hugo), Madame de la Garanderie, , the family of the owners of , Pauline M√©nard-Dorian, and her husband, the painter Hermann-Paul. The cross was transferred ten years later to the Pont du Mort (or the Maure), at the western entrance to the village on the road to Aigues-Mortes. After being slightly moved, the original cross was stolen. A copy of the original still stands there. In July 2016, the Camargue cross celebrated its 90th anniversary. It is seen throughout all of Camargue. It is also present in Marseille (Notre-Dame de la Garde basilica, , esplanade de la Bonne M√®re), in Toulon, in Istres, and in Avignon. The town of Radolfzell, Germany, is a twin city with Istres, so the cross can be found there.  Symbolism  The Camargue cross symbolizes the \\"Camargue Nation\\" (or \\"\\") by associating the symbols of the gardians, fishermen and Holy Marys of the Camargue. With its elements of early Christian symbolism, it embodies the three theological virtues: *faith (represented by tridents of the gardians on a Christian cross); *hope (represented by the anchor, which also represents fishermen); and *charity (represented by the symbol of the heart of the Marys of the Sea).

Muslims believe the Quran to be the final revelation of God to mankind, and a completion and confirmation of previous scriptures.Concise Encyclopedia of Islam, Cyril Glasse, Holy Books It was believed to have been revealed to the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad from 620 CE to 632 CE, and canonized in an official, unified text during the caliphate of Rashidun Uthman, around 650 CE. Orthodox Muslims (which includes almost all Muslims) also consider Hadith (the record of the words, actions, and the silent approval of the Islamic prophet Muhammad) to be divine revelation. They are extremely important because they give detailed direction to Muslims on far more issues than does the Quran so that most of the rules of Sharia (Islamic law) are derived from hadith, rather than the Quran. Not only were the hadith collections compiled centuries after the Quran, but their canonization also came much later. The two \\"most famous\\" collections of hadith -- sahihayn of al-Bukhari and Muslim‚Äîbegan to be accepted as authentic by the Malikis and Hanbali school of fiqh in the mid-5th/11th century. While hadith are considered divine revelation, the collections of them do not have the same status as copies of the Quran. Quran =Uthman ibn Affan and the canonization of the Quran= The Quran was canonized only after Muhammad's death in 632 CE. According to Islamic tradition the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan (r. 23/644‚Äì35 AH/655 CE) established the canonical Qur'an, reportedly starting the process in 644 CE, and completing the work around 650 CE (the exact date was not recorded by early Arab annalists). It is generally accepted that the Uthmanic text comprises all 114 surahs (chapters of the Quran) in the order known today. The Qur'anic canon is the form of the Quran as recited and written in which it is religiously binding for the Muslim community. This canonical corpus is closed and fixed in the sense that nothing in the Quran can be changed or modified. According to the traditional Islamic narrative, by the time of Uthman's caliphate, there was a perceived need for clarification of Qur'an reading. The holy book had often been spread to others orally by Muslims who had memorized the Quran in its entirety (huffaz), but now \\"sharp divergence\\" had appeared in recitation of the book among Muslims.Cook, The Koran, 2000: p.119 It is believed the general Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman reported this problem to the caliph and asked him to establish a unified text. According to the history of al-Tabari, during the expedition to conquer Armenia and Azerbaijan there were 10,000 Kufan Muslim warriors, 6,000 in Azerbaijan and 4,000 at Rayy, and a large number of these soldiers disagreed about the correct way of reciting the Quran. What was more, many of the huffaz were dying. 70 had been killed in the Battle of Yamama. The Islamic empire had also grown considerably, expanding into Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Iran, bringing into Islam's fold many new converts from various cultures with varying degrees of isolation. These converts spoke a variety of languages but were not well learned in Arabic, and so Uthman felt it was important to standardize the written text of the Quran on one specific Arabic dialect. Uthman obtained written \\"sheets\\" or parts of the Quran from ·∏§af·π£a, one of the widows of Muhammad. Other parts collected from Companions had been \\"written down on parchment, stone, palm leaves and the shoulder blades of camels\\". He appointed a commission consisting of a scribe of Muhammad, Zayd ibn Thabit and three prominent Meccans, and instructed them to copy the sheets into several volumes based on the dialect of the Quraysh ‚Äî the tribe of Muhammad and the main tribe of Mecca. Uthman's reaction in 653 is recorded in the following hadith from : > \\"So Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, \\"Send us the manuscripts of the > Quran so that we may compile the Quranic materials in perfect copies and > return the manuscripts to you.\\" Hafsa sent it to Uthman. Uthman then ordered > Zaid bin Thabit, Abdullah bin Az Zubair, Said bin Al-As and Abdur Rahman bin > Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. Uthman said > to the three Quraishi men, \\"In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any > point in the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Quran was > revealed in their tongue.\\" They did so, and when they had written many > copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. 'Uthman sent to > every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied and ordered that all > the other Quranic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or > whole copies, be burnt. Zayd bin Thabit added, \\"A Verse from Surat Ahzab was > missed by me when we copied the Quran and I used to hear Allah's Apostle > reciting it. So we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al- > Ansari. [That verse was]: 'Among the Believers are men who have been true in > their covenant with Allah.'\\" When the task was finished Uthman kept one copy in Medina and sent others to Kufa, Ba·π£ra, Damascus, and, according to some accounts, Mecca, and ordered that all other variant copies of the Quran be destroyed. Some non-Uthmanic Qurans are thought to have survived in Kufa, where Abdullah ibn Masud and his followers reportedly refused. This is one of the most contested issues and an area where many non-Muslim and Muslim scholars often clash. =Variants of the Quran= According to Islamic tradition the Quran was revealed to Muhammad in seven ahruf (translated variously as \\"styles\\", \\"forms\\", or \\"modes\\",Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips, Tafseer Soorah Al-Hujuraat, 1990, Tawheed Publications, Riyadh, pp. 29‚Äì30. singular harf). However, Uthman canonized only one of the harf (according to tradition). According to Islamic tradition, the other ahruf were destroyed because after Muhammad's death a rivalry began to develop among some of the Arab tribes over the alleged superiority of their ahruf. In addition, some new converts to Islam began mixing the various forms of recitation out of ignorance.Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips, Tafseer Soorah Al-Hujuraat, 1990, Tawheed Publications, Riyadh, p. 28-29 Consequently, as part of the canonization of the Quran, caliph Uthman ordered the rest of the ahruf to be destroyed. This does not mean that only one \\"reading\\" of the Quran is canonized. The single harf canonized by Uthman did not include vowels or diacritical marks for some consonants, which allowed for variant readings. Seven readings‚Äîknown as Qira'at‚Äîwere noted by scholar Abu Bakr Ibn MujƒÅhid and canonized in the 8th century CE.Shady Hekmat Nasser, Ibn Mujahid and the Canonization of the Seven Readings, p. 129. Taken from The Transmission of the Variant Readings of the Qur'an: The Problem of Tawaatur and the Emergence of Shawaadhdh. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2012. Later scholars, such as Ibn al-Jazari, added three other reciters (Abu Ja‚Äôfar from Madinah, Ya‚Äôqub from Basrah, and Khalaf from Kufa) to form the canonical list of ten Qira'at. Of the ten, the one qira'at has become so popular that (according to one source) \\"for all practical purposes\\", it is the one Quranic version in \\"general use\\" in the Muslim world todayB√∂wering, \\"Recent Research on the Construction of the Quran\\", 2008: p.74 \\\\-- Hafs ‚Äòan ‚ÄòAsim, specifically the standard Egyptian edition of the Qur‚Äôan first published on July 10, 1924 in Cairo. Mass-produced printing press mus'haf (written copies of the Quran) have been credited with narrowing the diversity of qira'at. =Shia belief= Something like 15% of Muslims are part of the Shƒ´‚Äòah (also Shia) branch of Islam. See further citations in the article Islam by country. Shia Islam holds that instead of Islam being led by a caliphate of caliphs chosen from the Companions of the Prophet after the death of the Prophet Muhammad, that Sunni believe in, Muhammad designated his nephew and son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor and the first Imam (leader) of Islam. While Shia use the same Qur'an as Sunni Muslims, they have a different story of its canonization, connected to the initial rift between the two groups, i.e. that the Companions of the Prophet (allegedly) unjustly denied Ali this leadership position. Most Shƒ´‚Äòah believe the Qur'an was gathered and compiled not by Uthman ibn Affan (one of The Companions) but by Muhammad himself during his lifetime. According to influential Shia Marja' Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, Uthman's collection of the Quran was metaphorical, not physical,. Rather than collecting the verses and surahs in one volume (Al- Khoei argues), Uthman united Muslims on the reading of one authoritative recension ‚Äî the one in circulation among most Muslims, having reached them through uninterrupted transmission from Muhammad. According to the Shia website Al-Islam, a minority of Shia believe the Quran was compiled by Ali, \\"after the Prophet‚Äôs death but before people finally accepted him as a caliph\\". While some Shia Muslims disputed the canonical validity of the Uthmanic codex, the majority do not and believe that the text is identical. the Shia Imams always rejected the idea of alteration of Qur'an's text. Only seven Shia scholars have believed in omissions in the Uthmanic codex. However, the story of the canonization of the Quran is of importance in Islam for a number of reasons. Since at least the 10th century anti-Shia Sunni Muslims have accused Shia of claiming that the contemporary Quran differs from what was revealed to Muhammad; of believing that the original Quran was edited to remove any references to (among other things) the rights of Ali and the Imams (descendants of Ali that should be accepted as leaders and guides of the Muslim community).Kohlberg & Amir-Moezzi 2009, p.vii The idea that the Quran was distorted is regard by these Sunnis as an outrageous Shia \\"heresy\\".Kohlberg & Amir-Moezzi 2009, p.24 Twelver Shia (the overwhelming majority of Shia are Twelver Shia) did at one time believe in the distortion of the Quran, according to western Islamic scholar Etan Kohlberg ‚Äî and the belief was common among Shia during the early Islamic centuries, but waned during the era of the Buyid dynasty (934‚Äì1062). Kohlberg claims that Ibn Babawayh was the first major Twelver author \\"to adopt a position identical to that of the Sunnis\\".Kohlberg & Amir-Moezzi 2009, p.27 This change in belief was primarily a result of the Shia \\"rise to power at the centre of the Sunni 'Abbasid caliphate,\\" whence belief in the corruption of the Quran became untenable vis-a-vis the position of Sunni ‚Äúorthodoxy‚Äù.Kohlberg & Amir-Moezzi 2009, p.26 The Brill Encyclopedia of the Quran also states some Shia Muslims have disputed the canonical validity of the Uthmanic codex, And according to Hossein Modarressi, seven early Shia scholars believed there are omissions in the Uthmanic codex. Hadith Second only to the Quran in authority as a source for religious law and moral guidance in Islam, are Hadith‚Äîthe record of what Muslims believe to be the words, actions, and the silent approval of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. While the number of verses pertaining to law in the Quran is relatively few, hadith give direction on everything from details of religious obligations (such as Ghusl or Wudu, ablutionsAn-Nawawi, Riyadh As- Salihin, 1975: p.203 for salat prayer), to the correct forms of salutationsAn- Nawawi, Riyadh As-Salihin, 1975: p.168 and the importance of benevolence to slaves.An-Nawawi, Riyadh As-Salihin, 1975: p.229 Thus the \\"great bulk\\" of the rules of Sharia (Islamic law) are derived from hadith, rather than the Quran.) Scriptural authority for hadith comes from the Quran which enjoins Muslims to emulate Muhammad and obey his judgments (in verses such as , ). Because there were a large number of false hadith, a great deal of effort was expended by scholars in a field known as hadith studies to sift through and grade hadith on a scale of authenticity. In Sunni Islam there are six major authentic hadith collections known as the Kutub al-Sittah (six books) or al-Sihah al- Sittah (the authentic six). The two \\"most famous\\" 'Authentic' (Sahih) ·∏•adƒ´th collections are those of Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim ‚Äî known as the sahihayn (two sahih). These works came out over two centuries after the Uthmanic codex, (the hadith collections do not have original publishing dates but the authors' death dates range from 870 to 915 CE). Because the Kutub al- Sittah hadith collections used by Sunni Muslims were based on narrators and transmitters that Shia Islam believed treated Ali unfairly and so were not trustworthy, Shia follow different hadith collections. The most famous being \\"The Four Books\\", which were compiled by three authors who are known as the 'Three Muhammads'.Momen, Moojan, Introduction to Shi'i Islam, Yale University Press, 1985, p.174. The Four Books are: Kitab al-Kafi by Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni al-Razi (329 AH), Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih by Muhammad ibn Babuya and Al-Tahdhib and Al-Istibsar both by Shaykh Muhammad Tusi. Shi'a clerics also make use of extensive collections and commentaries by later authors. Not only were the hadith collections compiled centuries after the Quran, but their canonization also came much later. Scholar Jonathan A. C. Brown has studied the process of canonization of the two \\"most famous\\" collections of hadith -- sahihayn of al-Bukhari and Muslim‚Äîwhich went from \\"controversial to indispensable\\" over the centuries. > From their very creation, they were subject to withering criticism and > rejection: Muslim was forced to argue that his book was merely meant as a > 'private collection' (94) and al-Bukhari was accused of plagiarism (95).

A Morthouse. or Deadhouse was a specialised secure building usually located in a churchyard where bodies were temporarily interred before a formal funeral took place. These buildings date back to the time when bodysnatchers or resurrectionists frequently illegally exhumed dead bodies that were then sold for dissection as part of human anatomy training at universities, etc. Morthouses were alternatives to mortsafes, watch houses, watch towers, etc. Graveyard security The Christian tradition at the time was that resurrection after death and entry into the afterlife required the body of the deceased to be whole at burial so that person could enter the kingdom of Heaven for eternal life complete in body and soul. The dissection of the corpses of hanged criminals was viewed in this context as part of the punishment.Mort Stone ‚Äì Great Witley Churchyard The level of security depended upon the financial means of the deceased's family, the wealth of the parish, etc. Cast iron mortsafe tombstone, Stewarton. Simpler techniques than morthouses to protect the recently deceased included the family acting as lookouts, high graveyard walls with locked gates, especially deep graves and even using heather, turf, stones, etc. mixed in with the grave's soil to make digging difficult and time consuming. Heavy mortstones could be placed over the grave and even the gravestone itself could be used as a deterrent, such as the especially large solid cast iron example at St Columba's in Stewarton, Ayrshire. Incentives for bodysnatching The law had previously been ill-suited to deal with the problem as the crime of theft only applies to property and the deceased are not defined as property, special care being taken to leave behind rings, mortcloths, etc. Belatedly the Anatomy Act 1832 codified the use of bodies for dissection, etc. and morthouses, etc therefore ceased to have a distinct purpose, the peak time of body snatching being from the 1730s until 1832. In the early 19th century bodysnatching was such a lucrative trade that devising of methods to prevent the taking of fresh corpses became essential. Large sums of money were paid for the recently deceased as the students were largely better off individuals at the time who could afford significant fees and university anatomy departments could otherwise only legally obtain corpses of criminals who had been hanged. Some of the poorer medical students were even involved in the supply of corpses to their colleagues. A mortuary or morgue differs from a morthouse in that is a place primarily used for the storage of human corpses awaiting identification or removal for autopsy prior to burial, cremation, etc. The requirement for corpses to be in good anatomical condition lent itself to methods of delaying burial until the bodies were of no dissection value in buildings with prison-like security systems in place.Canmore - Crail morthouse The Characteristics of Morthouses A watch tower at Dalkeith A metal coffin mortsafe at Colinton near Edinburgh. Morthouses usually did away with the expense of employing watchmen and money was therefore invested in making such buildings as secure as possible with thick stone walls, no windows, metal inner doors and outer doors with extra metal reinforcement to the locks and the wooden body of the door. A lack of ornamentation was common and few had inscriptions other than the date of construction. Some morthouses were built up against existing structures such as the graveyard wall to save on construction costs. A number of morthouses were built partly underground or were effectively subterranean to give added security, some were lead lined to prevent water seeping into the vault and air vents were a common feature. Massive walls were typical if the building was at ground level and one example was circular to make breaking through the wall more difficult. Many had shelves for the coffins and some had rollers for ease of movement of the heavy wooden coffins so that the least physical contact was required. The cadavers in their coffins were generally left in the morthouse for up to six weeks in summer months and as long as three months in winter time. At Udny Green morthouse rules stipulated the secure construction of coffins that had to be air-tight. Corpses that were \\"infectious or otherwise dangerous\\" were required to be enveloped in lead or tin plate. Use was by subscription or by payment of a fee. Some surviving examples of morthouses In Scotland the morthouses are mainly located in the North-East in an area from Crail in the South to Marnock in the North. A few isolated examples are also found in places such as Edinburgh and two examples survive in Ayrshire at Mauchline and Dreghorn. Most old morthouses are used for storage or have been abandoned, whilst a few have been adapted for other purposes. *Belhelvie (NJ9417) ‚Äì dating from 1835.

In 2019 a vacancy opened up in Ward 2 of Nelson Mandela Bay and after becoming the successful candidate for the ward the DA managed to obtain 94% of the vote in the by-election. Gouws still serves in this capacity for the DA in Nelson Mandela Bay. Gouws was also elected to serve as the Spokesperson for Economic Development, Tourism and Agriculture for the DA in Nelson Mandela Bay. He has served in this position from 2019 when Athol Trollip resigned as the caucus leader for the DA in Nelson Mandela Bay and was replaced by Jonothan Lawack who compiled his spokespeople to lead the DA from the opposition benches. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gouws with his caucus leadership formulated a plan that would assist in turning the metro around. Some elements of this plan have been adopted by the ANC government in the metro. Gouws was elected as a Member of the Provincial Council during the DA Eastern Cape's Virtual Congress. It was the first time any political party in Africa had its congress via digital means.  Andile Lungisa Jug Incident (2016)  During a council meeting in Nelson Mandela Bay in 2016, a brawl broke out that lead to glass jugs being thrown around injuring people. Andile Lungisa broke a glass jug over a fellow councillors head and was arrested for Grievous bodily harm. The footage of the incident was taken by Gouws which lead to a successful conviction. Andile Lungisa has however referred the matter back to the court in order to appeal his sentence but is not allowed to appeal his judgement. On the 9th of September 2020 the Supreme Court of Appeals read out their verdict and they upheld the previous sentencing from the initial court judgement that means that he will be serving 2 years in jail with the 3rd year being suspended. He started serving his two year jail term on the 17th of September 2020 at the Port Elizabeth Correctional Centre in North End. He has however appealed to the Constitutional Court to overturn his sentence but not his conviction.  Social Media  Gouws is often quoted by mainstream media outlets regarding his opinion on pertinent topics in South Africa. He is known for his YouTube channel which he started in 2009. His videos focus on current events in South Africa and mostly focus on the political aspect of South Africa. He also does a debate show which is called the Sunday Service, in which he speaks to senior politicians, celebrities and thought leaders about South Africa.  Personal Life  Gouws is a fluent speaker of Afrikaans and English. He has no children. He married Laurynne Meyer on 20 September 2014 in Port Elizabeth.

During this time, compulsory sterilization was motivated by eugenics. There is a lengthy history when it comes to compulsory sterilization in the United States and legislation allowing compulsory sterilization pertaining to developmentally disabled people, the U.S. prison system, and marginalized communities. Compulsory sterilization is the unwanted and/or nonconsensual sterilization of both men and women. The main form of sterilization for women is tubal ligation and for men it is vasectomy.  History and Legislation  = Indiana Eugenics Law = The first law concerning compulsory sterilization to be passed in the United States was in Indiana in 1907. The law was passed by Governor Frank J. Hanly, which permitted that certain individuals in state custody were to be mandatorily sterilized. This law was passed because of the belief held by Indiana authorities that \\"criminality, mental problems, and pauperism were hereditary\\". After the passage of this law, approximately thirty states followed suit and created compulsory sterilization laws based on the so-called scientific theory of eugenics. = Buck v. Bell (1927) = Buck v. Bell is a significant case in the eugenics movement in the United States because in this case the US Supreme Court allowed the forced sterilization of young woman Carrie Buck in the state of Virginia. Because of the ruling of this case, many women were forced to be sterilized as well. Buck, an inmate at the Virginia Colony for the Feebleminded, was deemed \\"feebleminded\\" and \\"sexually immoral\\" after becoming pregnant out of wedlock. After the birth of her child, Carrie Buck was sterilized. This case is so significant because from this, it was found by the Supreme Court that compulsory sterilization was within the police power of states, which therefore permitted the sterilization of both men and women. Still, primarily women like Carrie Buck were the victims of compulsory sterilization. = Patterns of Compulsory Sterilization Following Buck v. Bell = Following the ruling of Buck v. Bell, it was found that nationwide, the amount of sterilizations performed rose dramatically, especially those performed on women. Prior to this ruling, sterilization cases between men and women were about the same. In the years 1928 to 1932, it was found that women were sterilized two times more than men were. As this pattern continued to progress and numbers continued to rise, it was found that approximately 30,000 sterilizations had been performed in the United States, with more than half of them taking place in California. States began to institute more programs concerning compulsory sterilization, and also began to better fund older programs concerning this practice. = Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942) = It was not until 1942 that there was another Supreme Court case, Skinner v. Oklahoma, that concerned the issue of compulsory sterilization, this time one that struck down Oklahoma's Criminal Sterilization Act of 1935. This statue stated that the state of Oklahoma was permitted to sterilize any person who had been convicted of three or more crimes \\"amounting to felonies involving moral turpitude.\\" This was said to be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of this, therefore deeming the Oklahoma Criminal Sterilization Act of 1935 unconstitutional. While this was progress for the repealing of the harsh compulsory sterilization laws nationwide and the Buck v. Bell ruling, it did not completely get rid of compulsory sterilization legislation in the United States. While states began to dissipate their sterilization laws, this case did not overturn Buck v. Bell and it did not completely cease cases of compulsory sterilization in the United States.  Compulsory Sterilization and Developmentally Disabled People  = History = The compulsory sterilization of developmentally disabled people began in the late 19th century, even before the first state sterilization law was passed in 1907. From then on, the forced sterilizations of developmentally disabled people occurred in very high numbers until about the 1940s, when this number started to drop due to states beginning to repeal their laws allowing forced sterilization. The theory of eugenics acted as the reasoning provided as to why developmentally disabled people were targeted and forcibly sterilized at high rates. These people were seen as a \\"danger to society\\" and the goal was to prevent them from reproducing, mostly because of the false pretenses held by society that mental disability was inheritable. One of the first instances recorded of compulsory sterilization in the United States took place at the Kansas State Asylum for Idiotic and Imbecile Youth. Beginning in 1894, Dr. Hoyt Pilcher authorized the sterilization of both boys and girls who lived in the facility. There were many other notable institutions that engaged in the same practices, some of which still operate today and mention their histories of sterilization abuse. Buck v. Bell (1927) reinforced this by allowing the sterilization of Carrie Buck, who was deemed as \\"feeble minded similarly to her mother\\". In this ruling, it was stated by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. that '‚Äòsociety can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind ... three generations of imbeciles are enough\\". Many of these sterilizations took place in California, and it is thought that approximately 20,000 sterilizations of developmentally disabled people took place in California state homes and hospitals in the beginning half of the 20th century. In recent years, much information has been uncovered concerning the forced sterilization of developmentally disabled people in the United States. It was found that developmentally disabled patients of state homes and hospitals were extremely vulnerable and taken advantage of by eugenicists and healthcare professionals and sterilized against their wills. It was also found that many physicians and social workers coerced their patients into being sterilized, with spoken consent not being required. In the present day, most states have repealed their sterilization laws and have passed other legislation to protect the human rights of their citizens. = Present-Day Struggles = Spanning from the early to the mid 20th century, approximately 60,000 people were forcibly sterilized in the United States. Based on the previous rulings of the Supreme Court, it is said that these 60,000 people had their fundamental human rights violated when they were forcibly sterilized. Many of these people demand redress and compensation, but have not been able to totally receive that. While state legislatures and governors in states where compulsory sterilizations were performed have issued apologies and have began investigations into the cases of their citizen's forcible sterilizations, it has not completely amounted to victims getting proper compensation for their struggle. Because many states have repealed or amended their sterilization laws, cases brought about by victims do not fully hold up under present-day statutes. Further, some states' statutes of limitations prevent them from being able to assert claims of their forced sterilization.  Compulsory Sterilization in the United States Prison System  = History = Sterilization in the United States prison system dates back to the same origins as compulsory sterilization of the developmentally disabled. In the 1907 sterilization law passed by Indiana governor Frank J. Hanly, sterilization was made mandatory for \\"criminals, idiots, rapists, and imbeciles in state custody\\". From this, many Indiana men who were being held in Indiana State prisons were given vasectomies by Dr. Henry Sharp. Sharp even argued that \\"we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the future of our race and nation, to see that the defective and diseased do not multiply\\" when defending the sterilization procedures he performed. Following this, over 30 states enacted laws allowing sterilization of both the developmentally disabled and of criminals. In North Carolina, the heads of both state and penal institutions were given the right to sterilize, and often times coerced people into forced sterilization by threatening to revoke social service benefits. As mentioned above, most states have repealed their legislation allowing sterilization, but forced sterilization still continues to be present, and a problem in the United States prison system. = Legislation = Sterilization in the U.S. prison system is something that is both incentivized and done as punishment to inmates. Often times, people convicted of crimes involving child abuse are sentenced to compulsory sterilization, or offered lesser sentences if they agree to sterilization. One example of this was in 1993, Barbara and Ronald Gross were convicted of molesting their children and were both sentenced to ten years in prison. The Gross' were offered to be put on probation instead of serve their sentences by Judge Lynn Brown of Washington County, Tennessee. The circumstances of their probation included Barbara Gross agree to a tubal ligation. There have been many instances of sentences being reduced, or even replaced by probation in which the circumstances require some sort of sterilization or forced birth control. Some cases of this include State v. Wilder, in which a young woman was convicted by a Florida court for smothering her newborn baby. She was sentenced to two years in prison and then ten years on probation, which required her to agree to not conceive during that time. While they told her she could not conceive, they did not say she had to be abstinent during that time period, therefore obliging her to undergo some sort of birth control procedure. Additionally, in multiple rulings concerning women convicted of child abuse, there have been requirements to either get a birth control implant and/or to not conceive during the probationary period. Some of these cases are People v. Johnson and State v. Carlton. = Present-Day Sterilization in the United States Prison System = While sterilization laws have been repealed and new ones have been put in place to protect the bodily autonomy of people, there is still a major problem when it comes to the forced sterilization of women in the U.S. prison system. In California, it was found that over 100 women were unlawfully sterilized between the years of 2006 and 2010. Further, it was reported by the Center for Investigative Reporting that medical staffers at two California prisons with pregnant inmates targeted other inmates for sterilization who they thought would likely return to prison. A nother instance of modern day compulsory sterilization was at the White County Jail in Tennessee. In 2016, Judge Sam Benningfield signed an order that permitted inmates at the White County Jail to get 30 days taken off their sentences if they underwent a birth control procedure. As of February 2017, approximately 32 women had received birth control implants and 38 men had agreed to getting vasectomies. This practice was ceased two years after it began and was said to be in violation of the 14th Amendment‚Äôs Equal Protection and Due Process clauses. These are just some of the recent instances in which sterilization and incentivized birth control have been present in the U.S. Prison System.  Sterilization in Marginalized Communities  = Black Women as Targets = There is a long history when it comes to targeting marginalized women to be forcibly sterilized. While the prevalence of sterilization targeting developmentally disabled people stopped around the 1960s, members of marginalized communities are still the victims of forced sterilization. Relf v. Weinberger (1974) found that poor people were being forced to agree to sterilization when doctors would threaten to deny them welfare benefits and medical care. This case specifically involved Mary Alice and Minnie Relf, two black sisters who were 12-and 14-years-old. Their mother signed a consent form that was not explained to her or read prior, which ultimately lead to the irreversible sterilization of her daughters. This is just one instance of the targeting of marginalized groups for forced sterilization. Further, the practice of \\"Mississippi appendectomies\\", which was another term for compulsory hysterectomies was practiced on women of color in the South at teaching hospitals as practice for medical students. = Recent Allegations = More recently, allegations have surfaced that women at the Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia have been being transferred to a physician who has been performing forced hysterectomies on immigrant women without informed consent. When asked, the women stated that their procedures were not properly explained to them and they were also misinformed when told what procedures they would be undergoing. These claims are still being investigated, as whistleblower Dawn Wooten has just recently filed this complaint.

It consists of a Late Romanesque chancel and nave and a Late Gothic tower. The poets Poul Martin M√∏ller and Christian Winther grew up in the associated rectory to the west of the church. History The church was probably built around 1300. In the Middle Ages, it was dedicated to St. Nicolas, since it was then located close to the sea. The church was both before and after the Reformation owned by the Crown. It later passed into the ownership of the Barony of Frederiksdal. In 1801, the church was sold tto the local residents of the parish. Rasmus M√∏ller was the following year appointed as parish priest of K√∏belev and Vindeby. He was the father of Poul Martin M√∏ller, and his second marriage was to Hanne Winther, widow of the parish priest in Fernsmark, who was the mother of Christian Winther. Poul Martin M√∏ller and Christian Winther grew up together in the rectory and later went to school together in the Latin school in Nyk√∏bing on Falster. Rasmus M√∏ller was in 1820 appointed as stiftsprovst of Lolland Falster and succeeded P. O. Boisen as Bishop of Lolland-Falster in 1831. Ludvig B√∏rresen (17991867), who had for the past 20 years published the weekly magazine Den danske Bondeven, was in 1854 appointed as parish priest in K√∏belev. He was in 1867 succeeded by Frederik Helveg. In 1953, it was converted into a self-owning institution. Architecture East gable The chancel and nave are built in red brick. The east gable has corner lesenes and contains three bricked-in arched windows topped by an arch frieze. Both the original doors to the north and south, as well as a third door for the priest in the south wall of the chancel, have been bricked up. The gables of the Late Gothic tower were rebuilt in connection with a renovation of the church in 1863. An earlier pyramidical tower was also removed at this point, and the windows in the flank walls were enlarged. Interior The flat wooden ceiling was in the Late Gothic period replaced with a star-vaulted ceiling. The altarpiece contains a painting by Christopher Wilhelm Eckersberg from 1841. The pulpit is from 1593 and decorated with hj√∏rnehermer and reliefs of the evangelists. An epitaph from 1657 commemorates parish priest Poul Poulsen Danchel (d. 1668) there is also a portrait painting of a priest by Axel Hou. The Romanesque limestone font was imported from Gotland.

Synopsis  After a brutal invasion of China by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1937, a Chinese professor in Boston named Wu Ming Tai is compelled by his patriotism to return to Beijing to translate a document for the United Nations. This document is considered to be proof of war crimes committed by the Japanese Army. The Japanese are aware of the Professor's return to China and will do anything to stop the publication of this discovery, including kidnapping his brother and forcing him to become a Japanese citizen. When the American Army intervenes, they bomb Japanese fortresses. It is claimed, however, that the Americans want to claim China for themselves by taking control of Chinese fortifications. This plan is halted when an American soldier harasses a Chinese student, and the Americans are forced to withdraw, returning China's independence.

Some early smokeless propellants called bulk propellants were designed for a similar volume and reaction rate as gunpowder, but most modern smokeless powders have improved efficiency offering more energy from smaller charges.Hatcher (1951) p.34 This improved efficiency allows smaller cartridges for increased ammunition capacity. Modern smokeless propellants come in a wide variety of shapes, density, reaction rates, and energy to weight relationships. Similar volumes of different smokeless propellants may produce dangerously different pressures in the same cartridge.Root (1993) p.29  Dispenser design  Adjustable powder measures became available in the 1880s. One of the earliest was designed by John M. Barlow for the Ideal Manufacturing Company of Connecticut. These powder measures typically use gravity feed from a hopper of powder above an adjustable cavity in a rotating cylinder. A lever rotates the cylinder so the cavity moves between an upward position where powder can drain from the hopper into the cavity, and a lower position where the powder can drain from the cavity into an empty cartridge case.Sharpe (1953) pp.197&198  Dispenser operation  Modern smokeless propellant charges are specified by weight rather than volume, so the correct adjustment of the charge cavity is determined by weighing the charge dispensed by that adjustment. Some weight variation may be detected in sequential charges dispensed from the same volumetric adjustment.Jones (1995) p.77 Bridging or compaction of granular propellants may cause these volumetric dispensers to produce dissimilar charges. Uniformity is enhanced by maintaining a similar level of propellant in the feeding hopper and by avoiding non-uniform vibrations while dispensing charges.Sharpe (1953) pp.204-207 Powder measures may dispense more uniform charges of ball propellants than angular extruded Improved Military Rifle propellants.Matunas (1978) p.3  Bibliography   * *  Notes  Category:Handloading ","title":"Powder measure"},{"id":"65215287","text":"Marble bust of Cornelis II Landschot, sculpted by Sebatiaen van den Eynde, circa 1656, Museum Maagdenhuis, Antwerp Sebastiaen van den Eynden (Antwerp, baptized June 20, 1624 \\\\- Antwerp, before 1693) was a Flemish sculptor. He was a member of the Van den Eynde family of artists. Sebastiaen was either the son of Hubert van den Eynde and Norbert van den Eynde's half-brother, or, most likely, the son of Hubert's brother Cornelis, and thus Norbert's cousin and a brother to the architect-entrepreneur Jan II van den Eynde. Sebastiaen van den Eynden became master of the Guild of Saint Luke either in 1661 or 1662. Life Sebastiaen van den Eynde was born in Antwerp, Spanish Netherlands. He was baptized on June 20, 1624. Van den Eynde was born into a renowned family of artists, one of the top families of sculptors in Antwerp. The Van den Eynde were part of the informal Quellinus-Verbrugghen-Willemsens-Scheemaeckers-Van den Eynde association, which turned the sculpture market of Antwerp into one of monopoly. The extensive collaboration between the workshops of the aforementioned families in the late 17th century may be the most important factor to account for the intricate \\"unity of style and approaches that have made disentangling of hands particularly difficult for art historians.\\" koorafsluiting by Sebastiaen van den Eynde, circa 1665, St. James' Church, Antwerp Detail of sculpture above a second koorafsluiting in the apse of St. James' Church, Antwerp, Sebastiaen van den Eynde, circa 1665 Sebastiaen might have been the son of Hubert van den Eynde and Hubert's first wife Elizabeth Schorkens, who died just a few weeks after Sebastiaen's birth in 1624. However, he was most likely the son of Hubert's brother Cornelis, an architect-entrepreneur. In fact, Sebastiaen is not mentioned in any record as being the son of a master of the Guild. As a young man, Sebastiaen took a trip to Italy, spending some time in Rome. He returned to Antwerp as late as 1656. According to the Allgemeines K√ºnstlerlexikon, this may account for his getting his mastership at the Guild as late as at 37 years of age. In 1656, Van den Eynde produced a bust of Cornelis Landschot, an Antwerpian businessman and philanthropist. The sculpture, today housed at the Maagdenhuis Museum, used to stand above the entrance to the chapel of Falconrui. Van den Eynde produced several sculptured pieces of furniture for Antwerp's churches. These include an altar rail in black basanite with balusters and caryatids in white marble produced by Van den Eynde in 1653 for St. James' Church, after a model by Hubert van den Eynde. Van den Eynde produced the Carpenter's altar for the latter church, which has been dated to shortly after when he became a master craftsman in 1661/1662. Still in St. James' Church, there are two intricate koorafsluiting sculpted by Van den Eynde, both with pieces of sculpture in marble on top. They were probably produced around 1665.

Fossils of sister species Bretzia nebrascensis has been found in Nebraska and South Dakota  Description  Bretzia pseudalces is known from fossils of its jaws, teeth, leg bones, vertebrae, and antlers, and overall had approximately the same body size as a modern mule deer. However, it is easily distinguished by its dramatic antlers, which form a large palmate structure from a single anterior tine and posterior beam, superficially resembling a modern moose antlers.  Paleoecology  Bretzia pseudalces fossils are found with Teleoceras, Platagonus and Megatylopus, indicating they lived in the same space. The environment would have been mild and temperate, but seasonal, allowing for water levels to rise and fall. The majority of Psudalces fossils recovered from White Bluffs in the Ringold formation were degraded to various degrees, and bones of fish and small rodents were most commonly found with them, indicating that they were buried in silt and mud from riparian areas, including marshes or oxbow lakes.

Arrested and imprisoned several times, Amnesty International has recognized Yagublu as a prisoner of conscience.  Early life  Tofig Rashid oglu Yagublu was born on February 6, 1961, in the Azerbaijani-populated village of Injaoglu (Shua-Bolnisi), then Georgian SSR of the Soviet Union. In 1989, he applied for withdrawal from the membership of the CPSU. He took part in the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and was twice presented for the title of National Hero of Azerbaijan, but in the end, was not awarded for various reasons. In 2012, the Yeni Musavat online newspaper began publishing Yagublu's war diary.  Political activity  Yagublu joined Musavat in 1992. During the presidency of Abulfaz Elchibey, Yagublu was the first deputy head of the executive power of the Binagadi District, Baku.  Arrests  = Previous arrests = Yagublu has been arrested several times since 1998 when he was sentenced to two years of suspended imprisonment for participating in protests. On February 4, 2013, he was sentenced to 5 years in prison for participating in the anti-government protests. On March 17, 2016, he was pardoned by a presidential decree. In 2014, the Shaki Court of Grave Crimes sentenced Yagublu to five years in prison, officially for inciting mass violence. In October 2019, Yagublu was detained for 30 days, for failing to police orders during peaceful protests according to the official narrative. = Arrest in 2020 = According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Azerbaijan, on March 22, 2020, at about 15:00 in the Nizami District of Baku, a Toyota Corolla driven by Tofig Yagublu collided with a Lada Riva driven by Elkhan Jabrayilov. However, Yagublu's daughter, Nigar Hazi told that when he was in his parked car, another car drove into him, while Elkhan Jabrailov, who was driving, rushed to Yagublu with claims. Nemat Kerimli, one of Yagublu's advocates, claimed that the investigators were biased, and explained that the police had \\"seized Yagublu's mobile phone and wouldn't return it. Yagublu had recorded to his phone how, after the road accident, he was attacked by the man, who was later recognized to be a victim.\\" Nevertheless, head of the press-service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Ehsan Zahidov said that \\"even though the accident was caused by Tofig Yagublu, he started a conflict and beat Elkhan Jabrayilov and his wife Javahir Jabrayilova with fists and a wrench, causing them injuries of varying severity.\\" The Nizami District Police Office opened a criminal case under Article 221.3 of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan (Hooliganism, using weapons or items used as weapons if this was accompanied by violence against the victim or destruction or damage to other people's property). Tofig Yagublu was detained as a suspect. The next day, Tofig Yagublu was remanded in custody for 3 months and taken to Prison #3. However, he did not accept the criminal case against him and said that he was \\"slandered\\". He said that he treated the trial as biased and \\"fulfilling the political order\\" of the Azerbaijani leadership. His daughter Nigar Hazi also denied all charges. On May 21, Human Rights Watch urged the Azerbaijani authorities to set Tofig Yagublu free. On September 1, 2020, the public prosecutor spoke at the trial in the Nizami District Court, chaired by Judge Nariman Mehdiyev, and requested that Tofig Yagublu be sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison. On September 2, Yagublu accused the court and the authorities of fabricating charges, then declared that he will start a hunger strike in protest against this arbitrariness. On September 3, 2020, Tofig Yagublu was sentenced to 4 years and 3 months in prison.  Personal life  He is married and had two daughters and a son. In 2012, one of Yagublu's daughters, Nigar Hazi, was also imprisoned, while his other daughter, Nargiz Yagublu, died in 2015.

Colonial career Casman arrived in Vivi and joined an expedition led by Captain Edmond Hanssens. They left on 21 January 1884 with a column of 30 men, and reached the banks of the Bundi River on 23 January 1884. Rains had made it overflow its banks and turn its valley into a huge swamp. On 7 February 1884 they reached the north Manianga plateau, where Hanssens found a letter from Henry Morton Stanley directing him to come to L√©opoldville and Casman to establish a station at Mukumbi, five days by land northwest of Manyanga, near the source of the Mata River, a right tributary of the Congo. The Bavarian officer Boshaert was to be Casman's deputy. They left Manyanga on 12 February 1884 with 42 Africans who had been trained by Lieutenant Louis Haneuse. They traveled up the right bank of the Congo to Mpangu, then to the Mata River, Kinkumba, the capital of the Songo district, and finally to Mukumbi's huts which Casman reached on 19 February 1884. They smoothed their way with gifts to the local people. By 24 March 1884 two shelters had been erected for Casman's tent and merchandise. On 3 August 1884 he was visited by Lieutenant Willem Frans Van Kerckhoven who had been relieved of his command at Isangila and was concluding treaties with the tribes around Mukumbi.

Taxonomy Cladonia wainioi was described as a new species by Russian lichenologist Vsevolod Savich (1885‚Äì1972) in 1914. The first scientific specimens were collected in the Kamchatka Peninsula. The specific epithet honours Finnish lichenologist Edvard August Wainio. In early molecular phylogenetic analysis of genus Cladonia, Cladonia wainioi was positioned as basal to the rest of the Cladoniae. Stenroos and colleagues proposed placing it in subdivision I of Cladonia, a deviation from the placement in Cladonia section Ascyphiferae proposed by Teuvo Ahti a couple of years before. They suggested that C. wainioi is \\"rather distinct in its cladinioid branching and its production of merochlorophaeic acid\\". Description Cladonia wainioi has greenish to brownish mineral-grey podetia that are covered with small scales (squamulate). The axils (the inner junction of a branchlet with a branch or with another branchlet) are open. Pycnidia are common, while apothecia are rare. Cladonia wainioi is highly branched, and similar in form to the common species Cladonia multiformis and Cladonia furcata. The latter two species, however, have a lichen spot test of PD+ red, while C. wainioi is PD-.

Native Americans have inhabited the area since . History =Prehistory= Paleo-Indians inhabited Maryland beginning in 10,000 B.C. as the Pleistocene ice sheet retreated, having come from other areas of North America to hunt. Around 1,000 B.C., there were 8,000 Native Americans in the area divided into roughly 40 tribes. These early inhabitants primarily spoke Algonquin languages. Members of the Monongahela culture lived in the western portion of Maryland, constructing sites such as the Barton Village Site and Meyer Site. Evidence found at the Barton Village Site suggests that the area was occupied from A.D. 1000‚Äì1500. =17th century= John Smith Captain John Smith explored and mapped the Chesapeake Bay and its surrounding area from 1607 to 1609, interacting with a number of Native American groups along the way. On his 1607 voyage, Smith was captured near the Chickahominy River in Virginia and taken to Powhatan. While in captivity, he learned and recorded a significant amount about the lifestyle, language, and politics of the local Native Americans. The first European settlers in Maryland founded the settlement of St. Mary's City after arriving at St. Clement's Island in 1634. This land was purchased by Leonard Calvert from the Yaocomico people, who inhabited the site prior to colonial arrival. This was a largely peaceful interaction, with the two groups sharing the settlement until the Yaocomico left at the end of the growing season. In 1659, Colonel Edmund Scarborough led unprovoked attacks against the previously peaceful Assateague people. Referred to as the \\"Seaside War of 1659,\\" this series of raids increased natives' resentment of English settlers. Several treaties were signed between Maryland Colony and various local Native American tribes after 1650, including the Assateagues, Nanticokes, and Susquehannocks. Various Native American reservations were also established during this period, including Askiminokonson. =18th century= Treaties between settlers and Native Americans continued in the 18th century, with roughly 3,000 acres being set aside by the colony as Native American reservations. In June 1744, the leaders of the Six Nations gave up all of their claims within the colony. The Nanticoke tribe relinquished their land in June 1768, with the General Assembly's records stating that \\"they are desirous of totally leaving this Province and going to live with their Brethren who have incorporated themselves with the Six Nations.\\" =19th century= The Nanticoke Tribe was recognized by Maryland in 1881 as a legal entity. =20th century= The Baltimore American Indian Center was founded in 1968 to assist Native American residents in the area. =21st century= More than 40,000 people self- identified as being at least part American Indian in the 2010 U.S. Census. Tribes Prior to European arrival and the subsequent removal of indigenous people from the area, Native Americans occupied most of modern-day Maryland. The three main groups in the area were the Algonquin, Iroquois, and Siouan peoples. Native American territorial boundaries were extremely fluid during this period, with tribes often sharing territory and moving regularly. =Algonquin= There was a large Algonquin population within Maryland prior to European arrival. These Algonquin tribes were coastal, often living off the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean. Most Algonquins left the area by the 1700s. Choptank The Choptank tribe lived in modern-day Talbot, Dorchester, and Caroline counties, including the town of Cambridge. They were the only tribe granted a reservation by the Maryland colony, which they lived on until the land was sold to developers by the government in 1822. Lenape The Lenape, or Delaware, tribe had a number of residents within modern-day Cecil County. Like many other Lenape, most of these residents were forced to Oklahoma by the 1850s. Matapeake The Matapeake tribe lived on Kent Island and had contact with William Claiborne in 1631. Due to European encroachment on the island in the 17th and 18th centuries, many Matapeake left and assimilated into other Algonquin tribes. Nanticoke The Nanticoke people inhabited much of the Delmarva Peninsula, including modern-day Salisbury and Princess Anne. This group included several smaller tribes, including the Assategue and Piscataway. A member of the Powhatan Confederacy, the Nanticoke were named \\"Kuskarawaok\\" by John Smith in 1608. Most Nanticoke left Maryland by the 1750s, with others assimilating into European society in the area. =Iroquois= The Iroquois as a people were generally located in areas more northern than Maryland, but three tribes had a significant presence in the area. Massawomeck The Massawomeck's presence in Maryland was mostly within modern-day Allegany County and Garrett County. The tribe conducted raids against the western Maryland Algonquins and traded heavily with other tribes and Europeans. The tribe's fate is largely unknown, disappearing from historical record in 1635. Susquehannock The Susquehannock tribe was present in modern-day Allegany, Cecil, and Harford counties. After warring with Maryland colony from 1642 to 1652, the tribe signed a peace agreement that gave much of the land south of the mouth of the Susquehanna River to Maryland. This effectively ended the tribe's presence in Maryland. Tuscarora The Tuscarora tribe emigrated to Maryland after losing the Tuscarora War, in which they lost much of their land to North Carolinian settlers. Their presence was short-lived, with the tribe passing though Frederick County from 1719 to 1721. The tribe ultimately settled in the Great Lakes Region and became a member of the Iroquois Six Nation Confederation. =Siouan= John Smith did not encounter any Siouan Native Americans during his 1608 exploration. However, the Monacan, Saponi, and Tutelo tribes emigrated through Maryland during the mid-1700s. Some small bands of the Saponi and Tutelo tribes were found in the area following this emigration. The Saponi band settled in Dorchester County, with both groups likely later assimilating into the local Nanticoke tribe. Legal recognition =State recognition= Three tribes are formally recognized by the State of Maryland: * Accohannock Indian Tribe * Piscataway Conoy Tribe (Includes the Piscataway Conoy Confederacy and Sub-Tribes as well as the Cedarville Band of Piscataway Indians) * Piscataway Indian Nation The Maryland Commission on Indian Affairs serves eight groups of Native Americans: * Accohannock Indian Tribe * Assateague Peoples Tribe * Cedarville Band of Piscataway Indians (Sub-group of the Piscataway Conoy Tribe) * Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians * Piscataway Conoy Confederacy and Sub-Tribes (Sub-group of the Piscataway Conoy Tribe) * Piscataway Indian Nation * Pocomoke Indian Nation * Youghiogheny River Band of Shawnee Indian =Federal recognition= There are no federally recognized tribes within Maryland.

It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1978. Overview roof tiles made of fired clay were introduced to Japan from Baekche during the 6th century along with Buddhism. During the 570s under the reign of Emperor Bidatsu, the king of Baekche sent six people to Japan skilled in various aspects of Buddhism, including a temple architect. Initially, tiled roofs were a sign of great wealth and prestige, and used for temple and government buildings. The material had the advantages of great strength and durability, and could also be made at locations around the country wherever clay was available. The Otomefud≈çhara site is located at the western end of a plateau that extends along the left bank of the Omoi River, a tributary of the Watarase River that flows through the west of Oyama city. The ruins of four tile kilns were confirmed by a survey in 1976 lined up on the northern slope of the plateau, along with a clay excavation pit and the foundations of workshops. All of the kilns are anagama-style kilns, and traces of ash spread 80 meters east-west and 30 meters north-south in the valley in front of the ruins. The site has been known for centuries as a location where roof tile shards could be found. The presence of kiln ruins was conformed in 1977 and an excavation survey was conducted over 5 years from 1988. Excavations found 66 roof tiles in a number of styles, including a style similar to Hakuho period tiles, and tiles with arabesque decorations.These same types of tiles have been excavated from the nearby Shimotsuke Yakushi-ji temple ruins and the Shimotsuke Kokubun-ji ruins. The unearthed artifacts are stored and displayed in the adjacent Oyama City Museum, and the site was opened to the public as the Otome Kawaranosato Park, the first historic park in Oyama, in 1998. The site is about a 7 minute walk from Mamada Station on the JR East Tohoku Main Line.

Applied during endoscopy to bleeding lesions, TC-325 is derived from bentonite, and works to achieve hemostasis (control of bleeding) by absorbing water and creating a barrier that leads to mechanical tamponade (pressure) and concentration of clotting factors, resulting in enhanced coagulation (clotting of blood). TC-325 was approved for gastrointestinal bleeding from causes other than gastric or esophageal varices (eg, nonvariceal bleeding). TC-325 results in immediate control of bleeding in about 91% of cases. Technical success has gradually increased between 2011 and 2019, which may be due to device improvements or physician familiarity with the application of TC-325. Uses TC-325 is recommended for temporary control of gastrointestinal bleeding when other treatments are ineffective or not available. TC-325 may also be used for massive bleeding with poor visualization or diffuse bleeding due to cancer. The device is not FDA approved for the treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding. However, TC-325 is 90.4% effective in achieving initial hemostasis in variceal bleeding, and its use was associated with a 4.2% rate of rebleeding. TC-325 use for variceal bleeding is safe. Risks Risks of TC-325 use include failure to control bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation, bowel obstruction, or malfunction of device or delivery system. If TC-325 is used for the control of bleeding at the site of a sphincterotomy or ampullary resection, there is a risk of biliary obstruction. Additional risks include allergy to the TC-325 powder.

The ecoregion is almost completely surrounded by the lower elevation Sumatran lowland rain forests. The area is one of very high biodiversity - because of the relative isolation, and variety of forest types, there are 7 endemic species of mammals and eight endemic species of birds.  Location and description  The Barisan Mountains stretch for 1,600 km along the southwest side of Sumatra, the product of the subducting Australia Plate and the overriding Sunda Plate. The range averages less than 70 km wide, and rises from 44 meters to a maximum elevation of , with a mean elevation of . There are 35 active volcanoes in the region, with the western side steeper, and the eastern slide inclining to lowlands and plains.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Af)). This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60 mm of precipitation every month. Annual precipitation in the mountains averages 2,500 mm. The eastern side of the Barisan Mountains are in a rain shadow, and receive less precipitation than the west side.  Flora and fauna  75% of the ecoregion is covered with closed, broadleaf evergreen forest, another 15% in other types of closed forest, and 7% open forest. There are three main forest types in the ecoregion, based on elevation: the 'lower montane forest', 'upper montane forest', and 'sub-alpine forest'. The lower montane forest has tree species similar to the lowland rain forests, but they are shorter (up to 35 meters), buttresses are rare, llianas (woody vines) are rare, epiphytes become more common, and the lowland domination of trees of the family Dipterocarpaceae gives way to more trees of the oak family Fagaceae, such as Stone oaks (Lithocarpus), and of the laurel family Lauraceae, such as Cinnamomum burmansea. The upper montane forest forms at higher elevations, depending on temperature and cloud level. The trees in this zone are shorter (up to 20 meters, and epiphytes, such as moss and lichens, are more common. The sub-alpine forest zone begins at higher elevations, and features grasses, heath, and bogs. Tees in the sub-alpine zone are scattered and stunted, typically under 10 meters in height. Mammals of conservation interest include the vulnerable Thomas's langur (Presbytis thomasi), the vulnerable Sumatran striped rabbit (Nesolagus netscheri), and the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris).

It was initially located in the Christiania Tivoli amusement park in Oslo from 1893 to 1895, where it was led by Olaf M√∏rch Hansson. It staged performance of works such as Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts, Gabriel Finne's F√∏r afskeden (Before the Farewell), and Gunnar Heiberg's Balkonen (The Balcony). Kalle L√∏chen was among the first actors it engaged. In 1914 it became a silent film theater, one of three theaters in Oslo's Karl Johan neighborhood. It was located in the rear of the property at Karl Johans gate 39 and showed silent films until it was closed on June 1, 1931. It opened newly renovated in red, gold, and black as a theater stage on October 6, 1931, first led by Anton Heiberg, Thorleif Reiss, and Leif Enger. After renovation in the summer of 1933, Per Aabel and Thorleif Reiss took over as directors and led it through a period of staging comedies until 1938, when Aabel appeared in a guest performance at the Central Theater and then moved on to the National Theater. Nanna Stenersen made her debut at the theater in 1933, Ragnhild Michelsen performed there from 1935 to 1940 as well as Teddy Nordgren, and in 1936 Wenche Foss appeared at the theater and had her breakthrough in 1937 as the \\"champagne girl\\" (), until she married in 1939 and announced her transfer to the Central Theater. Thora Neels-Hansson made her debut at the theater in 1938 and left in 1940. During the summers, the theater was rented out for summer revues. After Thorleif Reiss moved on to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation in 1939, the theater briefly closed. The theater reopened on September 3, 1939 with Eigil Beck and AS Comedia as the new owner, new management, and a production of Anita Loos's The Whole Town's Talking with Hauk Aabel. Actors during this period included Frank Robert (1939, debut ‚Äì 1941), Stig Egede-Nissen (1940‚Äì1942), Arne Bang-Hansen (1941‚Äì1945), Axel Thue (1942), Alice M√ºrer Siem (1942, debut), Espen Skj√∏nberg, and Jack Fjeldstad (1942‚Äì1944). The music for the performances was often written by Carsten Carlsen, the husband of Lalla Carlsen, who played at the theater from 1940 to 1943. During the Second World War, the theater was led by Ellen Isefi√¶r, who initially wanted to manage a stage with a more literary orientation and moved away from farces. In May 1944, the theater donated a day's salary and income to the suffering in Bergen. A cabaret with the Danish actress and singer Lulu Ziegler was the highlight of the opening of newly renovated premises (often referred to as Paletten 'The Palette') on September 14, 1945, with Fridtjof Mj√∏en as the artistic director. Calle Moseby was also involved in the theater's management after the war, but the city's theaters frequently moved during this time, and the Carl Johan Theater was part of the Studio Theater from 1946 to 1950. Leo Lenz's comedy Trio (Norwegian title: To og to er tre 'Two and Two Are Three') was its first production, with music by Kristian Hauger and Leif Enger. After the Studio Theater closed in 1950, the Carl Johan Theater was an annex theater for the Oslo New Theater until 1952. After a renovation costing NOK 200,000, the theater reopened on September 25, 1952 with a screening of Jens Bjerre's 1951 documentary film Himalaya ‚Äì Verdens tag (The Himalayas: The Roof of the World). It was now operated by the company Oslo Kinematografer headed by Kristoffer Aamot, who used the theater for showing films. Norway's first screening of a 3D film (with polaroid filters) took place here on January 18, 1953, with cartoons by Norman McLaren, British landscape films, and some ballet. The theater ceased operating in April 1982, when it was decided that the building would be demolished. As a standalone theater it was closed in 1946.

Running large firms in the US and UK, Kellogg also bred award-winning Holstein cattle. Her family estate became the Osbornedale State Park and Osborne Homestead Museum. The museum is one of 13 sites on the Connecticut Women's Heritage Trail, celebrating the state's female trailblazers. Her bequest to the University of Connecticut funded the construction of the Frances E. Osborne Kellogg Dairy Center in Storrs in 1991.  Early life and family  Frances Eliza Osborne was from an old New Engalnd family. Her grandfather, John W. Osborne, co- founded the Osborne & Cheeseman Company, a brass manufacturer. Her father, Wilbur Fisk Osborne (1841‚Äì1907), inherited John Osborne's stake in the company and founded or co-founded several other firms, including the Union Fabric Company and the F. Kelley Company of Ansonia, the Connecticut Clasp Company of Bridgeport, and the Derby Silver Company, which became an affiliate of the International Silver Company. Wilbur Osborne was an American Civil War veteran, attaining the rank of major. He was an alumnus of Wesleyan University, a donor and trustee for Derby Neck Library, and an officer of the Derby Methodist Church. Frances Osborne was born at the Osborne Homestead in Derby, Connecticut, on May 11, 1876. She was the youngest of four children born to Wilbur Fisk Osborne (1841‚Äì1907) and Ellen Lucy Davis, and their only progeny to reach adulthood. Her doting parents nicknamed her \\"Bobbin\\" because, her father said, only the bobbins in his factory's knitting machines moved faster than she did. Her mother managed the family farm while her father ran the family business. Frances Osborne spent her childhood on the farm but studied violin in New Haven and visited her paternal aunt, Helen, in New York City, where her uncle, Henry Edward Krehbiel, took her to concerts and imparted a keen appreciation for opera, theatre, and the visual arts. A sewing needle accident left Frances Osborne blind in one eye in 1893. She never returned for her senior year at Ansonia High School. However, she continued to take lessons in violin and music theory, some at the future Juilliard School. In her twenties she began giving violin lessons in the Naugatuck River Valley. In 1901, she started a women‚Äôs choral group that grew into the Derby Choral Club, a mixed chorus of 250 voices directed by Horatio Parker. The chorus performed for 16 years till Parker's death in 1919. She learned the family business from her father and accompanied him on his travels and speaking engagements. She traveled independently too, attending Daughters of the American Revolution conventions.  Business acumen  On the morning of March 30, 1907, Wilbur F. Osborne died suddenly of a heart attack, after a quiet evening reading and playing chess with his daughter. His wife and daughter inherited his business interests. According to one anecdote, the probate judge suggested that the Osbornes sell the companies and live off the proceeds. Frances retorted, \\"Sell them? No. I intend to run them.\\" Despite the judge's horrified expression and resistance from minority shareholders, Frances was true to her word, running four companies and growing the family fortune. Women in the United States were not allowed to vote until 1920, and female chief executives were few and far between, but Frances Osborne succeeded through determination and business acumen. Osborne served as president of Union Fabric Company, which manufactured covered wire, including corset and hat wires. She served as vice president of Connecticut Clasp Company, which manufactured garment clasps, and as treasurer of the F. Kelly Company, which manufactured paper fasteners, hose supporters and corset and suspender trimmings. She also held stock in Derby Silver Company. In 1916, she became a founding partner of Steels and Busks Ltd. of Leicester, England, which made wires supports and springs for corsets and other women's garments. Her English business ventured doubled her investment in its first year. Osborne also served as the first woman bank director in Connecticut (of the Birmingham National Bank).  Dairy farming  Around 1910, Frances organized a major renovation of her home in Derby. Much of the elegant Colonial Revival remodeling was supervised by architect Henry Killham Murphy. In 1919, at the age of 43, Osborne married Waldo Stewart Kellogg (1870‚Äì1928), a 49-year-old architect from New York with a degree from Cornell University. She had hired his firm several years earlier to design cottages for her employees in Derby. Waldo managed and expanded the Osborndale Farm, while Frances continued to focus on her corporate ventures. The Kelloggs partnered in the raising and breeding of Holstein Friesian dairy cattle and developed a model dairying operation at Lakeview Dairy Farm, part of the Osbornedale estate. Their herd set records in milk production, butterfat, and milkfat and received numerous prizes at exhibitions and fairs throughout New England, New York, and Canada. After her husband died in 1928, Frances Osborne Kellogg carried on the management of Osbornedale Farm, breeding one of the most influential Holstein bulls of all time: \\"Osborndale Ivanhoe.\\" Some dairy publications ranked her among the top ten dairy breeders of all time. She served as president of the American Holstein-Friesian Association, president of the Connecticut Holstein-Friesian Association, director of the Connecticut Jersey Cattle Club, director of the National Dairy Show, and director of the New Haven County Farm Bureau.  Philanthropy  Kellogg was a committed conservationist, serving as the first female vice president of the Connecticut Forest and Parks Association from 1934 to 1938 and serving as a director for 20 years. In 1951, Kellogg donated her home and 350-acre family estate, later the Osbornedale State Park and Osborne Homestead Museum, to the State of Connecticut. She also left an endowment to establish a \\"nature education center,\\" now the Kellogg Environmental Center. Kellogg retained life usage of the estate until her death. Her housekeeper, Eva Little, also had life usage; she died in 1976. The Kellogg Family Trust and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection continue to provide for the upkeep of the park and the staff of the Kellogg Environmental Center and Osborne Homestead Museum. The museum is a 12-room Colonial Revival mansion originally built in 1840 and extensively renovated in 1910. The grounds feature extensive flower and rock gardens. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is one of 13 sites on the Connecticut Women's Heritage Trail, celebrating the state's female trailblazers. Kellogg was very active in the community. As president of the Women‚Äôs Club of Ansonia, Derby, and Shelton, she sponsored many famous musicians and celebrities, including Amelia Earhart and Harry Burleigh, to give lectures at the Sterling Opera House. She served as a trustee of Griffin Hospital, the first female member of the Board of Directors of Birmingham National Bank, member of the Derby Methodist Church, and president of the Board of Directors of Derby Neck Library, which her father had been instrumental in establishing in 1897. Kellogg continued to support the library after her father's death. She even spent afternoons volunteering at the library up until a few weeks before her death. The long-time librarian was Kellogg's cousin, Miss Helen Krehbiel, who died on July 10, 1956. Kellogg also served on the Derby Board of Education for eight years and on the Board of Zoning Appeals for a number of years, being a member at the time of her death. Kellogg's 1956 bequest to the University of Connecticut funded the construction of the Frances E. Osborne Kellogg Dairy Center on Horsebarn Hill Road in Storrs in 1991. The Kellogg Dairy Center is a state-of-the-art, free- stall facility and milking parlor. The building also contains a classroom, laboratory, animal surgery facility, and an area for the public to observe the milking.  Death  After several weeks' illness, Kellogg died at home on September 26, 1956. She was 80 years old. She was interred at the Oak Cliff Cemetery. Kellogg died without issue and was survived by several cousins.

He obtained his M.D. and membership of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1871. He was a surgeon at South Staffordshire General Hospital and Birmingham General Dispensary. He was appointed to the Cancer Hospital in Brompton, London in 1876. This was the first hospital in the world specifically founded to treat cancer patients. It was renamed the Royal Marsden Hospital in 1910. Snow worked at the Cancer Hospital as a staff surgeon until 1905. He was a cancer researcher who lectured and wrote extensively on the topic. Snow is known for his research on melanoma. In 1892, he proposed melanoma to be treated by excision and anticipatory gland excision which was controversial because this was before the acceptance of elective lymph node dissections. In 1893, Snow conducted the first epidemiological study linking cancer and depression. He studied 250 women with uterine and breast cancer. He found that \\"of 250 women suffering from cancer of the mammae and uterus... 171 had expressed history of an immediate antecedent of trouble often in very poignant form, as the loss of a near relative.\\" In 1896, Snow developed the Brompton cocktail made from a combination of morphine and cocaine to relieve pain in cancer patients.\\"The Brompton Cocktail: 19th century origins to 20th century demise ‚Äì by David Clark\\".

Brown, who coined it in the early 1960s at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where he developed undergraduate through doctoral programs in the discipline. To enhance the learning process (John Hill), he invited more than a dozen visiting performers from Africa and Asia and began a world music concert series. The term became current in the 1980s as a marketing/classificatory device in the media and the music industry. There are several conflicting definitions for world music. One is that it consists of \\"all the music in the world\\", though such a broad definition renders the term virtually meaningless.Bohlman, Philip (2002). World Music: A Very Short Introduction, \\"Preface\\". .Nidel 2004, p.3 The term also is taken as a classification of music that combines Western popular music styles with one of many genres of non-Western music that are also described as folk music or ethnic music. However, world music is not exclusively traditional folk music. It may include cutting edge pop music styles as well. Succinctly, it can be described as \\"local music from out there\\",fRoots magazine, quoted in N'Dour 2004, p. 1 or \\"someone else's local music\\".Songlines magazine It is a very nebulous term with an increasing number of genres that fall under the umbrella of world music to capture musical trends of combined ethnic style and texture, including Western elements. Evolving terminology Anda Union at a music festival In the age of digital music production the increased availability of high-quality, ethnic music samples, sound bites and loops from every known region are commonly used in commercial music production, which has exposed a vast spectrum of indigenous music texture to developing, independent artists. An amalgamation of roots music in the global, contemporary listening palette has become apparent, which weakens the role major entertainment labels such as Columbia, Warner, MCA and EMI can play in the cultural perception of genre boundaries. Similar terminology between distinctly different sub-categories under primary music genres, such as world, rock and pop, can be as ambiguous and confusing to industry moguls as it is to consumers. As Damian Burns writes, this is especially true in the context of world music, where branches of ethnically influenced pop trends are as genre-defined by consumer perception as they are by the music industry forums that govern the basis for categorical distinction. Academic scholars tend to agree that, in today's world of consumer music reviews and blogging, global music culture's public perception is what ultimately distils a prevailing basis for definition from genre ambiguity, regardless of how clearly a category has been outlined by corporate marketing forums and music journalism. The world music genre's gradual migration from a clear spectrum of roots music traditions to an extended list of hybrid subgenres is a good example of the motion genre boundaries can exhibit in a globalizing pop culture. The classic, original definition of world music was in part created to instill a perceived authenticity and distinction between indigenous music traditions and those that eventually become diluted by pop culture, and the modern debate over how possible it is to maintain that perception in the richly diverse genre of world music is ongoing. In a report on the 2014 globalFEST, National Public Radio's Anastasia Tsioulcas said, \\"Even within the 'world music' community, nobody likes the term 'world music'. It smacks of all kinds of loaded issues, from cultural colonialism to questions about what's 'authentic' and what isn't (and who might get to police such inquiries), and forces an incredible array of styles that don't have anything in common under the label of 'exotic Other.' What's more: I believe that in many people's imaginations, 'world music' means a kind of fairly awful, gloppy, hippy-ish, worldbeat fusion. It's a problematic, horrible term that satisfies absolutely no one.\\"  1987 industry meeting  Paul Simon had released a Southern African music-influenced album after falling in love with this music. On 29 June 1987, a meeting of interested parties gathered to capitalize on the marketing of non-Western folk music from. Paul Simon had released the world music-influenced album Graceland in 1986.http://www.paulsimon.com/music/graceland/ The concept behind the album had been to express his own sensibilities using the sounds he had fallen in love with while listening to artists from Southern Africa, including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Savuka. This project and the work of Peter Gabriel and Johnny Clegg among others had, to some degree, introduced non-Western music to a wider audience. They saw this as an opportunity. Although specialist music stores had been important in developing the genre over many years, the record companies, broadcasters and journalists had been finding it difficult to build a following because the music, itself, seemed too scarce. At the outset of the 1987 meeting, the musician Roger Armstrong advised the reason why something had to be done: The first concern of the meetings was to select the umbrella name that this music would be listed under. Suggestions included \\"world beat\\" and prefixing words such as \\"hot\\" or \\"tropical\\" to existing genre titles. \\"World music\\" won after a show of hands, but initially it was not meant to be the title for a whole new genre‚Äîjust something the record labels could place on record sleeves to distinguish them during the forthcoming campaign. Afterward, they agreed that despite the publicity campaign, this was not an exclusive club‚Äîand that for the good of all, any label that sold this type of music could use the name. Another issue was the distribution methods at the time. Most main labels were unhappy with the lack of specialist knowledge in their sales force, which led to poor service. Many larger outlets were reluctant to carry the music, because they favored larger releases they could promote within the store. It was difficult to justify a large presentation expense with limited stock going into stores. World music market One of the marketing strategies used in the vinyl market at the time was the use of browser cards, which would appear in the record racks. As part of the \\"world music\\" campaign, it was decided that these would be a two color affair designed to carry a special offer package; to aid the retailer a selection of labels would also be included, presumably for shelf or rack edging. In an unprecedented move, all of the world music labels coordinated together and developed a compilation cassette for the cover of the music magazine NME. The overall running time was 90 minutes, each package containing a mini-catalog showing the other releases on offer. By the time of a second meeting it became clear that a successful campaign required its own dedicated press officer. The press officer would be able to juggle various deadlines and sell the music as a concept‚Äînot just to national stations, but also regional DJs keen to expand their musical variety. DJs were a key resource as it was important to make \\"world music\\" important to people outside London‚Äîmost regions after all had a similarly heritage to tap into. A cost-effective way of achieving all this would be a leafleting campaign. The next step was to develop a world music chart, gathering together selling information from around fifty shops, so that it would finally be possible to see which were big sellers in the genre‚Äîso new listeners could see what was particularly popular. It was agreed that the NME could again be involved in printing the chart and also Music Week and the London listings magazine City Limits. It was also suggested that Andy Kershaw might be persuaded to do a run down of this chart on his show regularly. Criticism The term \\"world music\\" (or \\"global,\\" \\"international,\\" and the like) is a Western musical category encompassing many different styles of music from other parts of the globe. It includes many forms of music that Westerners consider ethnic, indigenous music, folk music, neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition, such as non-Western music and Western popular music, intermingle. World music is defined in opposition, and relative, to Western popular music and Western art music, and its constituent musics are positioned as equivalent to one another, despite the fact that they may have vastly different musical qualities. Therefore, the treatment of so-called world music is unequal to that of the normative music of the global West. This is primarily due to the fact that dominant corporate structures for music distribution and promotion in and originate in those continents, as do their forums for establishing industry genre categories. Therefore, in market context, \\"ethnic\\" music is synthetically defined by a radius that extends from a Western center. Some musicians and curators of music have come to dislike the term \\"world music\\". To these critics, \\"world music\\" is a parochial, catch-all marketing term for non-Western music of all genres. In, label founder and ex-Talking Heads frontman David Byrne wrote an \\"\\" editorial in ' explaining his objections to the term. Byrne argued that the labelling and categorization of other cultures as \\"exotic\\" serves to attract an insincere consumption and deter other potential consumers.

Identified as the ruins of the kokufu (provincial capital) of Shimotsuke Province, the site is protected by the national government as a National Historic Site from 1982. Overview In the late Nara period, after the establishment of a centralized government under the Ritsury≈ç system, local rule over the provinces was standardized under a kokufu (provincial capital), and each province was divided into smaller administrative districts, known as (ÈÉ°, gun, k≈çri), composed of 2‚Äì20 townships in 715 AD. The kokufu complex contained the official residence and offices of the kokushi, the official sent from the central government as provincial governor, along with buildings housing offices concerned with general administration, farming, finance, police and military. In the periphery there was a provincial school (kokugaku), the garrison and storehouses for taxes. The Shimotsuke Provincial Capital ruins are located in the precincts of Miyanobe Shrine, in the countryside on the right bank of a river running along the eastern edge of the city of Tochigi. An excavation survey conducted from 1976 to 1979 confirmed that layout of structures corresponded to that of the semi-standardized format for a government office complex and dated the site to 729 AD in the Nara period. The location also corresponds to the one given in the Wamy≈ç Ruijush≈ç from 935 AD, which contains the earliest surviving listing of the capitals of the provinces and their location. The foundation stones for various buildings were in good preservation. The site was a square area measuring one ch≈ç on each side (approximately 110 meters), surrounded by a wooden palisade. In the center was an administrative building, with a large main hall behind it. Side halls flanked these buildings to the east and west. The complex had a gate in each of the cardinal directions, with the main gate to the south. A road nine- meters in width led from the south gate to the center of the administrative complex. The structures were rebuilt in roughly four periods. The initial construction burned down around 780 AD, and again in 791 AD. The third construction was destroyed in the 9th century and the final construction fell into ruins around the beginning of the 10th century. Most of the site is still unexcavated, and it is believed that the ruins of a settlement which surrounded the provincial capital extend for several hundred meters in all directions. One of the buildings in the administrative complex, a 7 x 2 bay building measuring 22 meters by 4.8 meters, has been reconstructed and the site is open to the public as an archaeological park. Excavated artifacts, including wooden blocks with various inscriptions, lacquerware, and ceramic shards, are exhibited at a museum on site and at the Prefectural Museum in Utsunomiya.

Almeda produced the crosses by breeding purebred a Saanen doe imported from Australia with a Anglo-Nubian buck imported from the United States.

It was cancelled due to community opposition and associated highway revolts.  History  The Freeport‚ÄìRoslyn Expressway was proposed c. 1951, and would have been a \\"cross-island feeder\\"‚Äîor \\"leg\\"‚Äîof the Horrace Harding (Long Island) Expressway's extension to Roslyn (and eventually to Riverhead). The highway would have featured a total of 10 lanes, and had an estimated price tag of $40,000,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Though the plans were supported by Freeport's Northeast Civic Association, citing economic benefits, the expressway was quickly met with fierce community opposition, notably by the Freeport‚ÄìRoslyn Expressway Protest Committee, which successfully garnered tens of thousands of signatures, as well as nearly $20,000 (equivalent to $ in ), from people that were against the expressway's construction. This led to the Freeport‚ÄìRoslyn Expressway proposal being postponed by Nassau County c. March 1952, and ultimately being cancelled that October.  Route description  = Southern segment: Freeport to Baldwin = The section of the expressway between Freeport and Baldwin would have been located parallel (and adjacent) to Milburn Creek. Its southern terminus would be located at Atlantic Avenue. It would follow the creek and Brookside Avenue, traverse the former Milburn Golf Club, and go along the Baldwin side of Milburn reservoir. In addition to running adjacent to Milburn Creek, this routing would have also straddled the school district boundaries, meaning students would not need to cross to the other side of the expressway to get to and/or from school. = Middle segment = The middle segment would have brought the expressway through the heart of Nassau County, providing access to places such as Hempstead, Garden City, Roosevelt Field, and Mineola. = Northern segment = The northern segment would have followed (or paralleled) the alignment of Glen Cove Road, connecting to the Long Island Expressway (its parent route) in East Hills, in the vicinity of Roslyn.

He specialized in genre scenes of village life, with a focus on the fishing community.  Biography  His father was the painter and art restorer, Salvador Mart√≠nez Cubells, who provided him with his first lessons. His grandfather, Francisco Mart√≠nez Yago, was also a painter. Later, he attended the Escuela Especial de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado and the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. His teachers included Emilio Sala, Antonio Mu√±oz Degrain and Carlos de Haes.Biography @ the Real Academia de la Historia In 1899, he moved to Germany, where he settled in Munich; using it as a base for travels throughout Europe. While there, he continued his studies with Heinrich von Z√ºgel and was strongly influenced by the works of Wilhelm Leibl. He also first displayed preferences for marine art, genre scenes and portraits; predilections which came into full focus after 1903, when he visited the Netherlands and was exposed to the Hague School. Upon returning to Spain, he was named a Professor at the and his alma mater, the Real Academia, where he was later named an Academician.Biography @ the Museo del Prado He participated in numerous exhibitions; including the National Exhibtion of Fine Arts, where he received a Third Class prize in 1897, Second Class prizes in 1899 and 1901, and First Class prizes in 1904 and 1912, for \\"Work, Rest and family\\", and \\"Return from the Catch\\", respectively. He was also awarded a gold medal at the Exposici√≥n Internacional de Buenos Aires in 1910 and the Exposici√≥n Nacional de Panam√° in 1916. These awards encouraged him to visit America. He would participate in over forty international exhibitions altogether. Following his father's death in 1914, he built upon his existing collection to create one of the most significant private art collections in Spain. He was the recipient of numerous honors, including the Civil Order of Alfonso XII, the Order of Isabella the Catholic and the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown.

In 1942, Billboard magazine launched a chart ranking the \\"most popular records in Harlem\\". The chart was initially titled the Harlem Hit Parade and based on a survey of New York record stores primarily in the Harlem district of New York City, an area noted for its African American population and regarded as the \\"black capital of America\\". The chart is considered to be the start of the lineage of the magazine's R&B; chart, which as of 2020 is published under the title Hot R&B;/Hip Hop Songs. The chart was first published in the issue of Billboard dated October 24 and six songs reached number one in the remainder of the year. Most of 1942's number ones were in the jazz and swing genres, which were among the most popular styles of music in the early 1940s. The first chart-topper was \\"Take It and Git\\" by tuba player and bandleader Andy Kirk and his band the Twelve Clouds of Joy, which occupied the top spot for a single week. It would prove to be the only chart-topper for Kirk, who remained successful until the end of the 1940s but then broke up his band and largely left the music industry. The only song to spend multiple consecutive weeks at number one in 1942 was \\"White Christmas\\" by Bing Crosby with the Ken Darby Singers and John Scott Trotter and his Orchestra, which reached the top spot in the issue of Billboard dated December 19 and remained there the following week. This was the original release of the song, written by Irving Berlin for the film Holiday Inn, which has remained a perennial favourite for more than 70 years and has been acclaimed by Guinness World Records as the world's best- selling single, with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies worldwide. It also topped the magazine's overall National Best Selling Retail Records chart, the forerunner of the modern Hot 100. \\"Trav'lin' Light\\" by Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra featuring Lady Day had the highest total number of weeks atop the chart in 1942, spending three non-consecutive weeks in the top spot. Lady Day was a pseudonym for singer Billie Holiday, one of the most influential and highly-regarded jazz vocalists of all time; she was credited under her nickname because she was under contract as a soloist to a different record label.

A number also provide hydroelectricity and many old reservoirs also provided motive power for industries, especially for the processing of minerals such as metal ores and slate. Wales has a relatively high rainfall and significant areas of mountainous topography which are sparsely populated which ensures that water is a plentiful natural resource. Much of the south and east of England has significantly lower rainfall and a high population density which puts significant strain on the water supply infrastructure there. Collecting water in deep valleys with high river flows is far more efficient that trying to collect sparse rainfall in a generally flat landscape. Because of this engineers have viewed Wales as a potential supply of water. The rapidly growing populations of the industrial centres of Britain in the industrial revolution made the need for high volume supplies of clean water even more important and Wales was seen as the ideal source. Such engineering and economic views paid scant regard to the social, cultural and linguistic impacts that the constructions of large reservoirs in Wales would create. Some reservoirs have been formed by the raising of dams on water courses, others are natural water bodies, the levels of which have been raised to various degrees both for direct supply of water or else for regulation of supply with water being extracted from the river some way downstream. Many reservoirs which were constructed for one purpose e.g. industry, may now serve different or additional purposes e.g amenity or, as in many cases, have been abandoned entirely. Reservoirs range in size with many under 1 acre in area serving local needs, up to Llyn Trawsfynydd which extends to . Bala Lake (Welsh Llyn Tegid) is a natural lake which at , slightly exceeds Llyn Trawsfynydd in size, but whose height has been slightly raised. Water supply to England  Most Welsh lakes supply the nation itself with water, however, there are lakes and reservoirs which supply England. In the early 1960s, 70 people were forced to leave their homes in Capel Celyn before the whole valley was drowned, and the Llyn Celyn reservoir built in order to supply water to Liverpool, England, 60 miles (95km) away. Birmingham Corporation had one hundred occupants moved out of their homes in the Elan Valley, Powys, in order to build the reservoirs. Wales has its own water company, D≈µr Cymru, but two water companies operate across the border namely Severn Trent Water and United Utilities. Reservoirs in Snowdonia =Local water supply= Within Snowdonia, numerous existing natural lakes were co- opted to provide local water supplies during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Within the Carneddau, Llyn Dulyn and Llyn Melynllyn were dammed in 1881 and 1887 respectively, to provide water to Llandudno whilst Llyn Anafon was dammed in 1930 to do likewise for coastal communities to the north. Llyn Cowlyd has supplied the towns of Conwy and Colwyn Bay with water since the level of the natural lake was raised by a dam in 1897. Bala and surrounding villages have been supplied by the artificially raised waters of Llyn Arenig Fawr. Elsewhere Llyn Elsi has been supplying water to Betws-y-Coed since its damming in 1914 whilst supplies to the village and to nearby Llanrwst are supplemented by water from Llyn Conwy. Barmouth is served by Llyn Bodlyn. The height of Llyn Cwellyn was raised as it took on the role of supplying water to parts of Gwynedd and Anglesey. =HEP schemes= The establishment of an aluminium works at Dolgarrog led to construction of Dolgarrog Power Station which was supplied with water from the damming of the natural lake of Llyn Eigiau and the smaller Coedty Reservoir downstream of it. The latter was constructed in 1924 but the failure of the Eigiau dam in 1925 caused its destruction. It was rebuilt in 1926 and modified in 1956. Water was also sourced for this HEP scheme from Llyn Cowlyd, itself supplemented by a leat from a dammed Ffynnon Llugwy. The latter has provided a water supply for Bangor and east Anglesey since the mid 1970s. The extensive mire of Gors Goch was flooded by the raising of a dam between 1924 and 1928 to form Llyn Trawsfynydd to enable HEP at Maentwrog. Between 1965 and 1991 the reservoir was also used as a source of cooling water for the Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. The UK‚Äôs first major pumped storage scheme was developed at Ffestiniog in 1963. It uses Llyn Stwlan, a natural tarn lake enlarged by the construction of a dam as an upper reservoir and Tanygrisiau reservoir as a lower reservoir. Llyn Stwlan had been previously enlarged in 1898. The development during the 1970‚Äôs of the Dinorwig HEP scheme involved the damming of Marchlyn Mawr as a top water storage facility and the use of the originally natural ribbon lake of Llyn Peris as the lower reservoir for the scheme. Its capacity was increased by the removal of slate debris which had been dumped into it over decades during the operation of the Dinorwic quarry. On a smaller scale, the damming of Llyn Bodgynydd and Llyn Glangors served to provide power to the former Pandora lead mine just as Llyn Parc‚Äôs waters supplied power to Aberllyn lead and zinc mine. Llyn Mair provided both a drinking supply and a source of hydro-electric power for Plas Tan-y-Bwlch from the 1890‚Äôs. Reservoirs in South Wales The growth in the size of towns in industrialising South Wales during the latter part of the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries necessitated the construction of numerous reservoirs for domestic water supply and for industrial use. Cardiff Corporation Waterworks opened both Llanishen Reservoir and Lisvane Reservoir in 1886. It later commissioned the construction of three reservoirs in Cwm Taf to supply water to the capital. Beacons Reservoir was the first to take shape, between 1893-97, Cantref Reservoir was built between 1886-92 and the damming of the largest of the three, Llwyn-on Reservoir began in 1911 with the supply of water starting in the mid 1920s. Cray Reservoir was constructed between 1898-1908 to supply water to Swansea and the city council completed work on Usk Reservoir in 1955. Nearby Neath began to take water from Ystradfellte Reservoir in 1914 (1907) on completion of the rural district council‚Äôs work on the dam on the Afon Dringarth. Newport Corporation built Talybont Reservoir between 1931-1939. Llandegfedd Reservoir began supplying water in 1965 to Cardiff, Newport, Pontypool and other areas nearby. It draws its water from the River Usk, being pumped up from a weir above Usk. Grwyne Fawr Reservoir, the only reservoir within the Black Mountains massif was completed by Abertillery and District Water Board in 1928, serving to supply water to various towns in the traditional county of Monmouthshire. A holding reservoir in Cwmtillery was constructed as a part of the scheme. Blaenycwm Reservoir to the northwest of Brynmawr, was originally constructed as a water supply for Nantyglo Ironworks but enlarged for public supply during the 20th century. Llyn Brianne was constructed in the late 1960s to provide additional water supply to South Wales via the Felindre water treatment works. The original intention was to supplement supplies of water to Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot but a subsequent extension of the trunk mains provides water up to west Cardiff. River regulation Rivers are an effective and cheap means of moving water from high ground to lowland areas where much of the population lives. River regulation reservoirs make use of that opportunity to store winter rainfall and release it, as needed , during drier parts of the year. This makes increased volumes of water available for abstraction down-stream, sometimes right down at the tidal limit as in the case of the River Dee. It also provides flexibility in where the downstream abstractions are made depending on demand on a day-by-day basis. River regulation reservoirs may also play a role in winter flood mitigation. Operational rules may prescribe a maximum water height at the end of Autumn to ensure that the reservoir can absorb any extreme winter rainfall events in the uplands thus mitigating high flows downstream, Llyn Clywedog performs this function on the River Severn. River regulation reservoirs are marginally cheaper to construct since there is no requirement for a take-off tower or associated large volume pipe-work or aqueducts piercing the dam wall. However a number of such reservoirs have installed hydro-electric generating sets to extract power from the released water. Examples of river regulation reservoirs include Llyn Brianne on the River Tywi and Llyn Celyn and Llyn Brenig on the River Dee. Proposals in the past have also included complex inter-river transfer schemes with, in one case, the enlargement of Craig Goch reservoir, the release of water into the River Severn via the Afon Elan and then a pumped transfer into the headwaters of the River Thames. Despite the benefits of such regulation schemes, they have been shown to have a number of adverse environmental impacts. When releases are made they are typically from the reservoir bottom water drawing from the hypolimnion which is often very cold, acidic, iron rich and anoxic . The change in flow rate can also be very rapid which may be a serious hazard for water users who may have no warning of a very sudden increase in flow. Aquatic animals have also been shown to be adversely affected with spawning behaviour and smoltification of salmon affected below Llyn Brianne for example. There may also be unexpected benefits. The operational rules for Llyn Celyn include a specific allocation of releases for recreational purposes to support competitive whitewater sports in the Afon Tryweryn below the reservoir. Canolfan Tryweryn , the national white-water centre for Wales was constructed on the river and maintains the infrastructure of overhead gates etc for all white-water sports which also benefit from the routine releases of water to support river flow, mostly in the summer months. Notable reservoirs * Llyn Trawsfynydd is the only reservoir or lake in the United Kingdom to have provided a source of cooling water for a nuclear power station * Llyn Brianne has the tallest dam in the UK * Llyn Clywedog has the tallest concrete dam in the UK Safety and failures It was, in part, the failure of the Llyn Eigiau dam, and consequent collapse of the dam of a second reservoir (Coedty) downstream, in the then Caernarvonshire (modern Gwynedd) in 1925 with the loss of 16 lives in the village of Dolgarrog which led to the enactment of the Reservoirs (Safety Provisions) Act in 1930. Under this legislation, all reservoir owners in Wales and England were required to have them inspected by a suitably qualified civil engineer, if the capacity exceeded five million gallons (22,700 cubic metres). The Reservoirs Act of 1975 placed further duties upon both owners and local authorities in respect of the safety of those with a capacity of more than 25,000 cubic metres. The Environment Agency assumed safety responsibilities in September 2004 and in 2013 the duties were transferred from the Environment Agency Wales to Natural Resources Wales.

He was one of the pioneer priests in the Roman Catholic Dioese of Geraldton in Western Australia.  Early life  Adolphus Joseph Lecaille was born in Belgium. He expressed a vocation for the priesthood at an early age. Following his initial education in Belgium, he was then sent to Rome, Italy, to attend the Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide which trained missionaries to spread Catholicism through the world. There he studied mathematics, classics, philosophy and theology . He was ordained as a priest in 1856.  Religious life  Lecaille came to West Australia in 1858 when John Brady was Bishop of Perth and Joseph Serra was Coadjutor-Bishop. After a year in Bunbury, Lecaille was appointed to the charge of Greenough, a district including the little port of Geraldton, and in 1859 he arrived upon the scene of his main lifework. He was constantly on the move through the various Greenough settlements, Geraldton and Northampton, nor did he forget the scattered members of his flock far away in the lonely bush. It was before the development of the railways, and the bush tracks were very rough and difficult for any wheeled vehicles. Lecaille established churches and schools in: * Greenough (St. Peter's) * Bootenal *Dongarra (St Thomas') * Nabawa * Northampton * Geraldton * Irwin The first St. Peter's church at Greenough was opened in 1866 and cost ¬£233. It has since been pulled down. At Geraldton the foundation stone of St Francis Xavier's Church was laid in 1870. This same stone was re-laid by Bishop Kelly in 1918 in the base of the north-west tower of the St Francis Xavier Cathedral. Lecaille was also responsible Following the discovery of gold near Cooktown in Queensland in 1872 and the establishment and growth of sugar production during the 1870s, the Bishop of Brisbane, James Quinn petitioned the Roman Curia to create a vicariate in north Queensland to minister to Catholics in the region and to evangelise the Aborigines. The Vicariate Apostolic of Queensland was officially created on 27 January 1877 by Pope Pius IX. The Vicariate consisted of all the land in Queensland north of the line starting at Cape Hinchinbrook and then west to the border with South Australia (now Northern Territory). Lecaille was appointed the first Apostolic Pro-Vicar of the Queensland vicariate with Reverend Father Tarquin Tanganelli as the rector. Lecaille was to be based in Cooktown while Tanganelli was to be based at the Hodgkinson Minerals Area to minister to the needs of the miners and establish churches there. Due to a breakdown in communication, the news of the new Vicariate does not appear to have reached Australia until the arrival of Tanganelli and two other Italian priests in November 1877 to serve in the Vicariate. Lecaille (who was then based in Geraldton) did not take up his appointment in Queensland but remains recorded as holding the position from February to November 1877. As the years went by, the Catholic population in the Geraldton area grew in numbers and other priests were sent to assist. The Holy See then decided to excise this northern area from the Perth Diocese and created the Diocese Geraldton on 30 January 1898. It needed a pioneering bishop and, as Lecaille was a zealous archdeacon, he was offered the bishopric. Father Lecaille requested permission to decline the honour. He was getting old and worn out by his long years of work.  Later life  Soon after the appointment of William Bernard Kelly as Bishop, Lecaille journeyed down to Perth to undertake less arduous duties. He was chaplain to the Order of the Good Shepherd and at the Loretto Convent on Adelaide Terrace. Then he became ill and spent the last two years of his life being cared for by the Sisters at St John of God Hospital. Lecaille died on Thursday 7 May 1908 aged 83 years. He was buried on Saturday 9 May 1908 in the grounds of St Joseph's Orphanage. A Requiem Mass was held for him in Geraldton. In recognition of Lecaille's commitment and contribution to the Geraldton Diocese, on Friday 8 June 1936 the Bishop of Geraldton, James O'Collins exhumed Lecaille's remains from the graveyard at St Joseph's Orphanage and transferred them to Geraldton to be interred in a new mortuary chapel of St Francis Xavier's Cathedral. This chapel was built under the supervision of Dean John Hawes as its architect.The Bishop directed that Holy Mass should be celebrated there once a month for the souls of those buried in the Catholic portion of the cemetery at Utakarra, then about out of the city. The mortuary chapel is on the interior. It is built of stone with a vaulted roof.

Characters often include actors, playwrights, directors, prompters, understudies, set designers, critics, or casting agents. Common settings may include theatre auditoriums, dressing rooms, rehearsal spaces, or other places in which theatre is created and performed. Theatre-fiction may engage with and represent many different varieties of theatre, from performances of Shakespearean tragedy to Kabuki theatre to pantomime or marionette shows. List of Novels and Stories about Theatre The novels and stories in this list share a substantial and sustained focus on theatre. Many of them could be described as \\"theatre-novels\\" or \\"theatre-stories\\", as Graham Wolfe has defined these terms (Wolfe is referring to works whose engagement with theatre as artistic practice[s] or industry \\"is sufficiently developed to become a dominant\\" in the textWolfe, Graham. Theatre-Fiction in Britain from Henry James to Doris Lessing: Writing in the Wings. New York: Routledge, 2019. 4.). In some cases (e.g. Twain's Huckleberry Finn or Tolstoy's War and Peace), only particular segments or chapters focus on theatrical performance or characters associated with theatre; in other cases, the novel or story is dominantly concerned with theatre. * Paul Scarron, Le Roman comique (1651) * Henry Fielding, The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (1749) * Oliver Goldsmith, ‚ÄúThe Adventures of a Strolling Player‚Äù (1759) * Oliver Goldsmith, The Vicar of Wakefield (1766) * Fanny Burney, Evelina (1778) * Thomas Holcroft, Alwyn; or The Gentleman Comedian (1780) * Thomas Holcroft, The Adventures of Hugh Trevor (1794) * J.

It is one of four lighthouses that help guide shipping into the Liffey, and the Port of Dublin, all of which are operated and maintained by the Dublin Port Company. Built in 1882, it also affectionately called The Tea Caddy due to its architecture, and has also been described as \\"resembling a giant mailbox on stilts\\". History Completed in 1882, the green lighthouse consists of a square tower with a lantern room and gallery, which is supported by a series of concrete columns. This gives an overall height of . It is located midway between the end of the North Bull Wall, and Alexandra Quay and the main port. The other lighthouses for the port are Poolbeg at the end of the Great South Wall, North Bull at the end of the North Bull Wall, and North Wall Quay Lighthouse at the entrance to the Alexandra Basin. These lights and the various buoys at the side of the channel follow the convention of green on the right (starboard) and red on the left (port) when entering the dredged channel. The 1923 edition of the British Pilot shows that this has not always been the case, with a partial reversal of colours. Then Poolbeg light was painted black, North Bull had a red tower and North Bank showed an occulting white light from a \\"tower, painted with red and white bands\\". Although the fog bell at North Bank is now disused, in 1923 it was still operational, along with other bells at North Bull and North Wall Quay, whereas Poolbeg had a fog siren. Popular culture A large scale replica of the lighthouse complete with a working green light was built by artist Fergal McCarthy inside the Science Gallery at Trinity College, Dublin in 2015. It was part of the Home/Sick exhibition, McCarthy having been \\"fascinated for several years by the sight of the Northbank Lighthouse at the mouth of the Liffey estuary\\". In 2017, the lighthouse was used as a diving platform by cliff divers who put on a display as a part of the lead up to the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series competition that took place on Inishmore in June of that year. Operations Operated by the Dublin Port Company, it is registered under the international Admiralty number A5886 and it has the NGA identifier of 114‚Äì6632. With a focal height of above sea level, the light can be seen for 16 nautical miles. Its characteristic is an occulting green light, which is lit for seven seconds and eclipsed (or dark) for one second.

In prokaryotes, mRNAs are translated while they are transcribed. This allows communication between RNA polymerase, the multisubunit enzyme that catalyzes transcription, and the ribosome, which catalyzes translation. Coupling involves both direct physical interactions between RNA polymerase and the ribosome (\\"expressome\\" complexes), as well as ribosome-induced changes to the structure and accessibility of the intervening mRNA that affect transcription (\\"attenuation\\" and \\"polarity\\"). Significance Bacteria depend on transcription-translation coupling for genome integrity, termination of transcription and control of mRNA stability. Consequently, artificial disruption of transcription-translation coupling impairs the fitness of bacteria. Without coupling, genome integrity is compromised as stalled transcription complexes interfere with DNA replication and induce DNA breaks. Lack of coupling produces premature transcription termination, likely due to increased binding of termination factor Rho. Degradation of prokaryotic mRNAs is accelerated by loss of coupled translation due to increased availability of target sites of RNase E. It has also been suggested that coupling of transcription with translation is an important mechanism of preventing formation of deleterious R-loops. While transcription- translation coupling is likely prevalent across prokaryotic organisms, not all species are dependent on it. Unlike Eschericia coli, in Bacillus subtilis transcription significantly outpaces translation, and coupling consequently does not occur. Mechanisms Translation promotes transcription elongation and regulates transcription termination. Functional coupling between transcription and translation is caused by direct physical interactions between the ribosome and RNA polymerase (\\"expressome complex\\"), ribosome- dependent changes to nascent mRNA secondary structure which affect RNA polymerase activity (e.g. \\"attenuation\\"), and ribosome-dependent changes to nascent mRNA availability to transcription termination factor Rho (\\"polarity\\"). =Expressome complex= The expressome is a supramolecular complex consisting of RNA polymerase and a trailing ribosome linked by a shared mRNA transcript. It is supported by the transcription factors NusG and NusA, which interact with both RNA polymerase and the ribosome to couple the complexes together. When coupled by transcription factor NusG, the ribosome binds newly synthesized mRNA and prevents formation of secondary structures that inhibit transcription. Formation of an expressome complex also aids transcription elongation by the trailing ribosome opposing back-tracking of RNA polymerase. Three-dimensional models of ribosome-RNA polymerase expressome complexes have been determined by cryo-electron micrscopy. =Ribosome- mediated attenuation= Ribosome-mediated attenuation is a gene expression mechanism in which a transcriptional termination signal is regulated by translation. Attenuation occurs at the start of some prokaryotic operons at sequences called \\"attenuators\\", which have been identified in operons encoding amino acid biosynthesis enzymes, pyrimidine biosynthesis enzymes and antibiotic resistance factors. The attenuator functions via a set of mRNA sequence elements that coordinate the status of translation to a transcription termination signal: * A short open reading frame encoding a \\"leader peptide\\" * A transcription pause sequence * A \\"control region\\" * A transcription termination signal Once the start of the leader open reading frame has been transcribed, RNA polymerase pauses due to folding of the nascent mRNA. This programmed arrest of transcription gives time for translation of the leader peptide to commence, and transcription to resume once coupled to translation. The downstream \\"control region\\" then modulates the elongation rate of either the ribosome or RNA polymerase. The factor determining this depends on the function of the downstream genes (e.g. the operon encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis of histidine contains a series of histidine codons is the control region). The role of the control region is to modulate whether transcription remains coupled to translation depending on the cellular state (e.g. a low availability of histidine slows translation leading to uncoupling, while high availability of histidine permits efficient translation and maintains coupling). Finally, the transcription terminator sequence is transcribed. Whether transcription is coupled to translation determines whether this stops transcription. The terminator requires folding of the mRNA, and by unwinding mRNA structures the ribosome elects the formation of either of two alternative structures: the terminator, or a competing fold termed the \\"antiterminator\\". For amino acid biosynthesis operons, these allow the gene expression machinery to sense the abundance of the amino acid produced by the encoded enzymes, and adjust the level of downstream gene expression accordingly: transcription occurring only if the amino acid abundance is low and the demand for the enzymes is therefore high. Examples include the histidine (his) and tryptophan (trp) biosynthetic operons. The term \\"attenuation\\" was introduced to describe the his operon. While it is typically used to describe biosynthesis operons of amino acids and other metabolites, programmed transcription termination that does not occur at the end of a gene was first identified in Œª phage. The discovery of attenuation was significant as it represented a regulatory mechanism distinct from repression. The trp operon is regulated by both attenuation and repression, and was the first evidence that gene expression regulation mechanisms can be overlapping or redundant. =Polarity= \\"Polarity\\" is a gene expression mechanism in which transcription terminates prematurely due to a loss of coupling between transcription and translation. Transcription outpaces translation when the ribosome pauses or encounters a premature stop codon. This allows the transcription termination factor Rho to bind the mRNA and terminate mRNA synthesis. Consequently, genes that are downstream in the operon are not transcribed, and therefore not expressed. Polarity serves as mRNA quality control, allowing unused transcripts to be terminated prematurely, rather than synthesized and degraded. The term \\"polarity\\" was introduced to describe the observation that the order of genes within an operon is important: a nonsense mutation within an upstream gene effects the transcription of downstream genes. Furthermore, the position of the nonsense mutation within the upstream gene modulates the \\"degree of polarity\\", with nonsense mutations at the start of the upstream genes exerting stronger polarity (more reduced transcription) on downstream genes. Unlike the mechanism of attenuation, which involves intrinsic termination of transcription at well-defined programmed sites, polarity is Rho-dependent and termination occurs at variable position. Discovery The potential for transcription and translation to regulate each other was recognized by the team of Marshall Nirenberg, who discovered that the processes are physically connected through the formation of a DNA-ribosome complex. As part of the efforts of Nirenberg's group to determine the genetic code that underlies protein synthesis, they pioneered the use of cell-free in vitro protein synthesis reactions. Analysis of these reactions revealed that protein synthesis is mRNA-dependent, and that the sequence of the mRNA strictly defines the sequence of the protein product. For this work in breaking in the genetic code, Nirenberg was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968. Having established that transcription and translation are linked biochemically (translation depends on the product of transcription), an outstanding question remained whether they were linked physically - whether the newly synthesized mRNA released from the DNA before it is translated, or if can translation occur concurrently with transcription. Electron micrographs of stained cell-free protein synthesis reactions revealed branched assemblies in which strings of ribosomes are linked to a central DNA fibre. DNA isolated from bacterial cells co-sediment with ribosomes, further supporting the conclusion that transcription and translation occur together. Direct contact between ribosomes and RNA polymerase are observable within these early micrographs. The potential for simultaneous regulation of transcription and translation at this junction was noted in Nirenberg's work as early as 1964.

It now houses the Museu do Combatente (Combatant‚Äôs museum) and the Monument to Overseas Combatants. History Construction of the fort, which follows a polygonal outline on the right bank of the River Tagus, was started in 1780 under the direction of General Guilherme de Valler√©e. A residence for the governor of the fort was added soon after, within the perimeter. On the basis of an inscription over the main entrance, it appears that the fort was completed in 1802. In 1808, during the occupation of Lisbon by French forces commanded by Marshal Junot, the fort was connected to the Bel√©m Tower by an artillery battery, known as the left flank battery. In 1815, after the French had been defeated, a right flank was added. By 1836 the fort was in ruins and it was effectively abandoned until 1870. It underwent extensive modernization between 1870 and 1874, after which it received two Krupp 28 cm Haubitze L/12 howitzers, and became one of a number of forts, known as the Campo Entrincheirado (Entrenched Field) of Lisbon, that formed a defensive perimeter that followed the boundaries of Lisbon at the time. Later, its defence consisted of five 120mm Schneider pieces. During the failed coup attempt of 18 May, 1925, an attempt was made to attack the fort. During the Portuguese Colonial War (19611975) the Fort of Bom Sucesso served as the headquarters of the Military Postal Service. After the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974, which overthrew the authoritarian Estado Novo regime, it hosted the Command of the Military Intervention Group, a body set up by the Revolutionary Council to maintain law and order. Later it was the headquarters of the Association of 25th of April, an organization that brought together the members of the military who initiated the Carnation Revolution. The Combatant‚Äôs Museum On January 13, 1999, the fort was officially handed over to the Portuguese League of Combatants, which manages the museum. It offers a permanent exhibition indoors, as well as three external areas with equipment related to the various branches of the Armed Forces. The permanent exhibition covers World War I, the colonial campaigns (known in Portugal as the overseas campaigns), and peace missions. The museum also has social areas, conference and projection rooms, and a bar.

The younger brother and partner of the more widely known George Jacob Holyoake, Austin Holyoake was himself a significant figure in nineteenth century secularism.  Life  Austin Holyoake was born in Birmingham on 27 October 1826 to George Holyoake (a printer) and his wife Catherine Groves (a horn-button maker). Taking an early interest in the ideas of Robert Owen and the Owenite movement, Holyoake worked for various radical papers as a printer in Birmingham and London, before taking charge of printing The Reasoner (his brother George Jacob's periodical) in 1847. The two brothers entered into a partnership, acquiring their own premises at 147 Fleet Street in 1853. At these premises, known as Fleet Street House, The Reasoner was produced and Austin Holyoake acted as secretary. Edward Royle describes how > The work of the Fleet Street House was divided into three business > departments. In 1856 these were Publishing, under Frederick Farrah; the News > Agency, under Thomas Wilks; and Printing, under John Watts. [George Jacob] > Holyoake was the Director, and his brother Austin, secretary and general > assistant...The printing and publishing business was taken over by Austin in > 1859, lapsed in 1862 when the Fleet Street House was sold, but was revived > as 'Austin & Co.' at 17 Johnson's Court in 1864. This business then passed > successively to Charles Watts, Charles Albert Watts and the Rationalist > Press Association. Austin Holyoake was a member of multiple radical and reformist groups, including the Reform League, and the author of many tracts and pamphlets. A member of the Association for the Repeal of Taxes on Knowledge, he was the last printer in England prosecuted under the Newspaper Stamp Act. Holyoake was sub-editor of Charles Bradlaugh's National Reformer from 1866 to his death, also co-editing with Bradlaugh the Secular Almanac. The two were 'intimate friends and co-workers.' Holyoake was a vice-president, and the first treasurer, of the National Secular Society, founded by Bradlaugh in 1866. Though he did lecture for the secularist movement on occasion, much of Holyoake's work was undertaken behind the scenes: > Austin was, said the Secular Chronicle in 1872, 'one of those quiet, > unostentatious workers who are the real bone and sinew of the Secular body - > like the stage manager, without whose work the play would be incomplete, but > who seldom comes before the curtain to receive the plaudits of the > audience.' Emily Faithfull, who Holyoake instructed in printing techniques. In 1859, he assisted the founders of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women in establishing the suitability of printing as an occupation for women. His employment by Bessie Parkes and Emily Faithfull for this purpose, helped to pave the way for Faithfull's Victoria Press at Great Coram Street, London, which opened in 1860.  Family  Holyoake's first wife, Lucy Pettigrew, died in childbirth in 1855 after four years of marriage. He married his second wife, Jane Baker, in 1858 and had a son and a daughter. Jane was a professional singer, who performed under the name Alice Austin.  Death and Legacy  Austin Holyoake died from consumption on 10 April 1874 at Johnson's Court, and was buried at Highgate Cemetery with the secular service he had composed. He was 47 years old. Along with its announcement of his death, The National Reformer printed Holyoake's 'Thoughts in the Sick-Room', which stated his continuing absence of belief in any god or afterlife: > As I have stated before, my mind being free from any doubts on these > bewildering matters of speculation, I have experienced for twenty years the > most perfect mental repose; and now I find that the near approach of death, > the 'grim King of Terrors,' gives me not the slightest alarm. In 1878 The Secular Chronicle printed a profile of Holyoake, written by Harriet Law, describing 'a career of usefulness cut short'. During a debate in the House of Lords in 1876, the Marquess of Salisbury used the example of Holyoake's service as a warning about changing the rules concerning nonconformist burials > I hold in my hand a burial service by Austin Holyoake, one of the first > sentences of which is directed towards a repudiation of the doctrine of > immortality. I may quote a single verse from a hymn - \\"parsons may preach > and the fanatics rave / Of existence beyond the dark grave. / Their heaven, > they say, is far up above, / But mine is on earth, and I call it Love.\\" Large or Small Families, a pamphlet by Austin HolyoakeIn 1882, Holyoake's close friend, the poet James Thomson, was buried in the same grave with an adaptation of the burial service written by, and given for, Holyoake.

Another writer described him as \\"a first-class actor with an outstandingly good baritone voice, plus a highly developed flair for the dramatic.\\" Sidney Theodore Felstead, Stars who Made the Halls: A Hundred Years of English Humor, Harmony and Hilarity, T. W. Laurie Limited, 1946, p.80 Biography Born in London, he was a waiter at the Surrey Theatre before becoming a stage actor in melodramas. His earliest success was a dramatic sketch, \\"On Guard\\" in 1880, written by Harry Adams. In this, Godfrey first sang a song, \\"Here Upon Guard Am I\\", about the Battle of Balaclava while dressed in full military uniform. After a break in which the theatre orchestra played \\"Rule, Britannia!\\", he returned to the stage in the guise of an elderly tramp, to deliver a monologue saying that he was no longer wanted by society, before dying in a snowstorm. Jeffrey Richards, Imperialism and Music: Britain, 1876-1953, Manchester University Press, 2001, pp.332-334 Dave Russell, Popular Music in England 1840-1914: A Social History, Manchester University Press, 1997, p.129 Chance Newton said that \\"Godfrey's vigorous acting of the neglected old soldier... raised vast audiences to an almost incredible pitch of enthusiasm...\\". Historian Jeffrey Richards says that \\"the appeal of the sketch was the classic combination of melodrama, sentimentality and patriotism.\\" Godfrey continued to perform the sketch to audiences around the country through the 1880s. Godfrey performed a varied range of other songs and monologues, including \\"The Masher King\\", written and composed by Harry Adams and Edward Jonghmans, and first performed in 1884; a \\"masher\\" was a slang term for a dissolute dandy of the type who frequented music halls. Another successful song by Godfrey was \\"Hi- Tiddley-Hi-Ti\\" (1890), with lyrics by E. W. Rogers and music by George Le Brunn.Richard Anthony Baker, British Music Hall: an illustrated history, Pen & Sword, 2014, , p.141 Somewhat in contrast was his patriotic 1893 monologue \\"Fighting with the Seventh Royal Fusiliers\\", written by Le Brunn with words by Wal Pink recounting an incident supposed to have happened at the Battle of Inkerman. According to General Sir Ian Hamilton, the song generated \\"an overwhelming rush of recruits\\" such that \\"recruiting for the regiment had to be closed for a year.\\" Another well-received song was \\"It's the English Speaking Race Against the World\\". Godfrey's performances also included portraits of such British heroes as Francis Drake, Admiral Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and General Gordon. Promoted by Harry Rickards, Godfrey toured in Australia and New Zealand. Godfrey was known to be a heavy drinker, which undermined his health. He died in 1900, aged 49, at Brierley Hill, Staffordshire, \\"The Death of Charles Godfrey\\", Perth Sunday Times, 13 May 1900, p.2 while undertaking a tour of theatres in the Birmingham area.

It is a subsidiary department of the Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries which was formed as a new Indian ministry in 2019. The DAHD or the erstwhile Department of Animal husbandry, Fishiries and Dairying was formed in 1991 by merging together into a separate department, of two divisions of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation namely Animal husbandry and Dairy development.In 1997 the fishiries division of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation and a part of Ministry of Food Processing Industries was transferred to it.In February 2019 the Department of Fishiries was carved out from the Department of Animal husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries and it has been functioning as Department of Animal husbandry and Dairying since then.

They sing in Irish and often reference their support for republicanism. They first began releasing music in 2017 with their single \\"C.E.A.R.T.A.\\" (Gaelic for \\"RIGHTS\\"). After releasing various singles such as \\"Get Your Brits Out\\", they released their first album 3CAG in 2018.  History  The group began when M√≥gla√≠ Bap was out spray- painting with a friend the day before the Irish Language Act march in Belfast. He had written \\"Cearta\\" on a bus stop when the police arrived and arrested his friend while M√≥gal√≠ escaped. The friend refused to speak English, and ended up spending a night in the cells awaiting a translator. This was the inspiration for their song \\"C.E.A.R.T.A.\\", which they intended to release \\"just for the craic. No plans for after,\\" Mo Chara said they wanted to \\"stick the feelers out and see how it would go down. Luckily people enjoyed it, so we're still at it.\\" M√≥gla√≠ Bap has cited his biggest influences as rebel songs due to their satire and humour \\"that idea of turning something dark into something funny\\". Mo Chara has described his musical influences as being listening to old school hip hop, particularly N.W.A., with his uncle, and as he grew up his favourite band were the Stone Roses.  Politics  Kneecap have openly voiced support for a United Ireland, believing that it is inevitable and that Ireland is \\"closer to it than they have been in a long time\\". They have also gone viral when Mo Chara said in an interview that the reason English people know so little about Ireland is that when they began colonising countries they \\"refused to learn their culture and refused to learn their history\\" he then drew comparisons between England and Germany by saying \\"After the World war they (Germany) learnt about the fucking world war and, they've come to terms with the fact that alright the Nazis were a thing and the best thing we can do is acknowledge it and get over it whereas the Brits just want to forget their past because they feel too guilty.\\" They have also shown support for Palestine by flying its flag at concerts.  Controversies  In late 2017 their song \\"C.E.A.R.T.A.\\" was banned from the Irish language radio Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (RT√â) for \\"drug references and cursing\\". Fans started a petition which garnered 700 signatures to put the song back on air. Kneecap defended the song as \\"a caricature of life in west Belfast\\" and \\"a satirical take on life for young people, particularly in west Belfast\\". In February of 2019 they received condemnation from the DUP politician and south Belfast MLA Christopher Stalford, for their chants of 'Brits out' at Belfast's Empire music hall a day after Prince William and Kate Middleton spoke there. They claimed that it was about Brexit. and released an official statement to his comments with a slow motion video of Mo Chara raising his middle finger to a remix of Come Out Ye Black and Tans.

He was \\"the closest thing New England, and the world for that matter, will ever get to a real-life Doctor Dolittle; all sorts of New England birds and animals‚Äìfoxes, wolves, chickadees, bears and bison were known to roam around and in and out of his house.\\" He treated animals like friends, but unlike Doolittle, never claimed to talk to them. He was instrumental in bringing to public attention the near demise of songbirds and of the bison. He founded the American Bison Society, of which President Teddy Roosevelt was honorary chairman. Origins He was born on 1 May 1868 at Calcutta, West Bengal in India, a son of John Baynes (1842‚Äì1903, Portland, Maine), a British inventor, by his wife Helen Augusta Nowill Baynes (1850‚Äì1909). In the 1870s, after his father had failed at running a textiles company in Calcutta, the family moved to New York, where John set up the Baynes Tracery and Mosaic Co., which produced etched memorial tablets, among other products. He patented manufacturing processes with the tastemaker Lockwood de Forest, and Baynes tablets survive at Grace Church in Newark, the Battell Chapel and Norfolk Library in Norfolk, Connecticut, and the Cleveland Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. John claimed (without proof) to have invented \\"photo-modeling\\", a technique for using light to carve sculpture. Ernest's siblings included Lillian Baynes Griffin, a British-born American journalist and photographer, and John R. Baynes, a metal etcher and photographer. Career He received his early education in England and aged 11 moved with his parents to Bronx Park, New York. He graduated as valedictorian of his high school class and subsequently attended the College of the City of New York. In the 1890s he started publishing articles on nature and wildlife in various newspapers. \\"Without the constraints of scholarly publishing, he became a wildlife showman through his articles and appearances.\\" Buffalo conservation Baynes driving his bison team of War Whoop and Tomahawk, 1907 In 1904 he was appointed conservator of the Corbin Park buffalo reserve on the edge of the Blue Mountain Forest in New Hampshire, by Austin Corbin, Jr. (d.1938), whose father the banker and railroad entrepreneur Austin Corbin (1827-1896) had established it. Known as the \\"Blue Mountain Forest Association\\", it was a limited membership proprietary hunting club, the park of which comprised in the towns of Cornish, Croydon, Grantham, Newport and Plainfield. Corbin Sr. imported bison from Oklahoma, Montana, Wyoming, Manitoba and Texas and donated bison to other American zoos and preserves. He also imported exotic species from Europe and Canada, including wild boar from the Black Forest of Germany.Mary T. Kronenwetter, \\"Corbin's 'Animal Garden'\\", Eastman Living online magazine (2011) Having been purchased by a syndicate of hunters in 1944,Outsideinradio.org, \\"Episode 27: Millionaires' Hunt Club\\" (December 29, 2016) the park survives in 2020, surrounded by a chain-link fence, as a non-profit organizationhttp://outsideinradio.org/shows/ep27 with a membership of about 30 wealthy game hunters,Concord Monitor (January 13, 2020) and is referred to as the \\"millionaires hunt club\\", said to be \\"the most exclusive game preserve in the United States\\". The herd of bison, however, was destroyed in the 1940s following an outbreak of brucellosis,Kronenwetter and the main species preserved and hunted are elk and boar. From a natural level of 60 million in America, the bison population had been reduced by human activity to just 1,000 by the 1890s, and in 1904 160 of these beasts lived within Corbin Park. In about 1906 Baynes conducted a survey into surviving numbers of American bison, and found that 2,039 existed, 325 in the wild (25 in the USA, 300 in Canada), and 1,714 in captivity (1,109 in the USA, 175 in Canada and 130 in Europe, 300 elsewhere).The Kansas City March 3 1908, Preserving the American Bison ‚Äî Ernest Harold Baynes Assumes the Self-Appointed Task of Rounding Up and Preserving All the Buffaloes Now in Existence, the Total Number of Which is 2,039; of These 325 Being Wild ‚Äì Three Hundred of the Wild Ones Are in Canada ‚Äì How he \\"Broke\\" Two of Them to Harness After 15 years of work and campaigning by Baynes, the national bison herd had increased to 20,000. He was famous for his tame bison and for driving around the park in a carriage pulled by a pair of bison War Whoop and Tomahawk, trained by him in an effort to promote the usefulness of the breed as draught animals. Baynes commented, \\"Of all the works of the late Mr. Austin Corbin, the preservation of that herd of bison was the one that would earn his country's deepest gratitude. His experiment led to the founding of the American Bison Society and was connected, directly or otherwise, with the formation of some of our national parks.\\"Quoted in Kronenwetter (See also Bison hunting ‚Äì Beginnings of resurgence.) Bird conservation \\"Luncheon for Ernest Harold Baynes and a chickadee\\", 1905 photograph by Louise Birt Baynes He campaigned against wild birds being killed for their plumage. In 1913 he established one of the earliest bird sanctuaries (the Meriden Bird Club) at his home at Meriden, New Hampshire, which occasion was marked by a play being performed there in 1914 written by poet Percy MacKaye and called Sanctuary: A Bird Masque, with actors dressed in bird costumes, including Baynes himself in the role of \\"Shy, the Naturalist\\".The Audubon annual bulletin. Birds; Birds. Illinois Audubon Society 31 Amongst the audience was President Woodrow Wilson. Baynes' activity is believed to have maintained the political appetite to ban the importation of bird feathers, included within the Underwood Tariff bill then being debated in Congress. The play was performed across the country and helped to fuel the bird-protection movement developing in the 1910s.

The game is set to be released on November 12, 2020 for Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and iOS. Gameplay The Pathless is an action-adventure video game played from a third-person perspective. In the game, the player controls the Hunter, who must find a way to lift the curse on an island. The hunter is a master archer. She must use her bows and arrows to shoot talismans scattered throughout the world, which will fill the Hunter's dash meter and allow her to swiftly navigate the game's world. She is also accompanied by an eagle companion, which can carry the player while flying. The eagle loses altitude while carrying the Hunter, though it can gain altitude through flapping its wings. Unlike other open world games, the game does not feature a mini-map. Players need to use \\"Spirit Vision\\" in order to find locations of interest. By exploring the game's world, players would collect crystals which can be used to upgrade the eagle's abilities. Throughout the hunter's journey, she is hunted by invincible cursed spirits which attempt to separate her from her eagle. Players need to avoid alerting them through stealth. Players need to return light to the obelisks scattered in the game's world, which weakens the curse spirits, allowing players to defeat them. Players will lose the crystals they have collected when they are defeated by the cursed spirits. Development The Pathless is being developed by Giant Squid, the creator of Abz√ª (2016). According to creative director Matt Nava, The Pathless \\"is about finding your own way forward\\". Therefore, the team decided to remove the mini- map feature typically seen in open world maps in order to facilitate exploration. The team put heavy emphasis on creating a movement system that is fast and fluid so as to remove the need of incorporating fast travel points. Unlike other games in which the player will respawn at checkpoints when they loses all their health, The Pathless adopts a system in which the players will lose the crystals they have collected instead. According to Nava, this system helps create tension and stake without breaking the player's immersion, which may be the result of respawning the player character. The game was announced at The Game Awards 2018. Initially set to be released in 2019, the game was delayed to early 2020 as the team needed additional time for development. The game is set to be released for Windows via Epic Games Store, iOS via Apple Arcade, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on November 12, 2020.

Professor V.I. Razumovsky became the first university rector.http://sgmu.ru/news/paper/2007/03/art01.html He was a prominent public figure, talented surgeon, and unique scientist who is considered to be the founder of a neurosurgery school in Russia. Construction of major university buildings as well as the university clinic named after S.R. Mirotvortsev was carried out under the supervision of the talented russian architect Karl Hermann Ludwig M√ºffke. In 1930, the Medical Faculty of Saratov University was transformed into an independent institution of higher education, which was known as the Medical Institute.

It has an elevation between 1,000 and 1,600 metres above sea level. It was part of the former Damot Weyde (Woreda), near to Sodo Zuria woreda. It is now under the Diguna Fango woreda. Some writers mention the town as Bilate Tena in their books and journals. Among them Getahun Garedew Wodaje late Head Officer in Education Bureau of Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region is the prior. On the book he wrote about \\"Local Adaptation Practices in Response to Climate Change in the Bilate River Basin, Southern Ethiopia\\", he used these two names, Dimtu and Bilate Tena, in the similar way.  History  David Buxton stated in his book that Dimtu was the name of a market, and it was near the Bilate River. As unwritten source reveals that the name was derived from the word \\"Danttuwa\\", which in Wolaytta language means the junction. It was named so because the market is located, where Bilate River and the \\"Qocuwaa\\" river, which is from Dimtu town, meet. Dimtu is the oldest town in the Wolaita Zone, next to Sodo, the capital of Wolaita. About 81% of town has electric coverages. The town is almost covered by asphalt roads, and is located 333 KM from Addis Abeba to the South-West, and 68 KM from Sodo.  Demographics  Based on the 2018 population projection by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, Dimtu has a total population of 25,294, of whom 15,855 are men and 9,439 are women.

The primary school is the very oldest one when compered to the secondary and preparatory school of the town. It is one of the primary school that established in 1940's after the revolution in the period of Haile Selassie I for education. By this time, it's reported that about 400 primary schools established all over the country and Bilate Tena Primary school is among them.Damtew Teferra and Philip G.

It is a right tributary of the lower Congo River that enters the river below the Inga Falls. If the proposed Grand Inga Dam project goes ahead, the river valley will be flooded to form a huge lake. Early European visitors In 1816 Captain James Hingston Tuckey of the British Royal Navy was the first European to visit the Bundi valley. At that time the Inga plateau was then the base of a chiefdom with 300 people and 70 huts. The market in Inga prospered from imposing levies on British, Portuguese, French and Belgian slave traders going up river, and on slave caravans coming down to the Atlantic coast. Henry Morton Stanley visited in February 1880. He speculated that at some time in the past the Congo had run through the Bundi valley, leaving it almost completely level. He wrote, \\"The Bundi is a beautiful stream of very clear water, brawling in the dry season over rocks and smoothly polished stones and pebbles at the bottom of a deep rocky valley. He said that game was abundant, but unfortunately so were sand-flies, gad-flies and chigoes, while in the yellow creek the crocodiles were numerous. He measured the distance from the Bundi to the Bula River as almost . Guillaume Casman arrived in Vivi and joined an expedition led by Captain Edmond Hanssens. They left on 21 January 1884 with a column of 30 men, and reached the banks of the Bundi River on 23 January 1884. Rains had made it overflow its banks and turn its valley into a huge swamp. The Swedish officer passed the river when travelling from Vivi to Isangila. He wrote in 1887: Grand Inga Dam A 2013 BBC article said the DRC had signed a deal with South Africa to sell it power from the planned Grand Inga Dam hydroelectric power project. A single dam wall would feed six power stations that would produce 40,000 megawatts of electricity. The tall dam would flood the Bundi valley, which was home to 30,000 villagers, turning the valley into a huge lake. The Congo River would now enter the north end of the lake, and leave through turbines at the dam across the south end. In June 2020 it was reported that President F√©lix Tshisekedi was planning to present the Grand Inga projects to meetings of the Africans heads of state, to obtain expressions of interest in buying the energy that would be produced. Opponents of the dam noted that the Bundi valley holds a combination of agricultural lands and natural environments that are home to wildlife. Up to 60,000 people could be displaced, and the network of roads and power lines across the Congo basin could cause create social and environmental damage. No environmental impact study was planned.

His father was a Northumberland journeyman mason and contractor-builder. Kyle was articled to his uncle John Dobson and worked with him on local projects such as Newcastle railway station, some of the Quayside buildings, and the King Street-Queen Street block which was the site of a major fire in 1867. Among his independent works, he designed an extension which forms part of the College of St Hild and St Bede, now part of Newcastle University, besides the Chaucer Building in Grainger Street West, tenements, baths for Newcastle Lunatic Asylum, and baths and a wash house for the general public. Around north-east England he designed a number of nonconformist chapels and parsonages, and he was architect to the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral. As a young man he lay in wait and caught a burglar who was carrying away of lead. He was teetotal and took part in the temperance movement. He was involved in a number of business ventures in Newcastle, and he took active part in local politics. Background Lowford Bridge, designed by Gibson Kyle snr Kyle's paternal grandparents were mason Joseph Kyle (1759 or 1760‚Äì1849),; Deaths Dec 1849 Kyle Joseph Newcastle T 25 307 and Jane Barnes. Kyle's father was also named Gibson Kyle (1789‚Äì1867), Deaths Sep 1867 Kyle Gibson 78 Tynemouth 10b 126; and he was a mason. Kyle's mother was Elizabeth Dobson (1793‚Äì1868). In 1821 along with his brother-in-law John Dobson, Gibson Kyle senior was a witness in the indictment of the bailiffs and burgesses of Morpeth, regarding the \\"ruinous state of the bridge of that town.\\" Kyle senior, the bridge surveyor for the county, reported that the bridge, known as Three Mile Bridge, was so narrow that he had to dismount from his horse at the widest part of the bridge, to let a carriage pass him. It was Gibson Kyle senior who in 1835 designed the replacement Lowford Bridge, a skew bridge that permitted the B6343 road to be straightened a little. His stone arches \\"threatened to collapse\\" but were rebuilt with the assistance of Edward Chapman of Newcastle, who replaced the stone with brick. Gibson Kyle senior was one of the contractors for building Morpeth Gaol (designed by John Dobson in 1822‚Äì1828), and his servant Sarah Detchen who stole from him was the first convict to be jailed there. By 1843 Kyle senior was a journeyman mason, a builder-contractor and an insolvent debtor. Life Richard Gibson Kyle was born in Ponteland, Northumberland, in 1820, and died at 2 Roseville, Bensham, Gateshead on 21 January 1903, aged 82 years. His wife was Mrs Elizabeth Dowson, (Hexham ca.1819 ‚Äì Gateshead 1868), the former \\"active, intelligent and kind\\" matron of Newcastle Infirmary, Deaths Mar 1868 Kyle Elizabeth 49 Gateshead 10a 414 and widowed by 1851.1851 England Census HO107/2406 p.1 They married in Haltwhistle in July 1855, Marriages Jun 1855 Doson Elizabeth and Kyle Gibson Haltwhistle 10b 381 and their son was the architect Alfred Gibson Kyle (1856‚Äì1940). Births Jun 1856 Kyle Alfred Gibson Durham 10a 247 Deaths Mar 1940 Kyle Alfred G. 83 Gateshead 10a 1844 Gibson Kyle was a teetotaller, and belonged to the Newcastle auxiliary of the United Kingdom Alliance. He is buried in Elswick Cemetery, Newcastle. In 1842, Kyle caught a burglar. Thomas Middlemass, who worked in Richard Grainger's Clayton Street shop, had noticed that lead was going missing, and young Kyle was hidden away there to watch for the thief. He saw John Marshall enter by the window and leave with of lead, and Marshall was still carrying it when Kyle caught him. The thief was taken to Court and committed to the sessions. In 1866, Kyle was called for jury service. The jury was reassured that although they would be dealing with a great number of cases, the majority would be \\"very trifling in description.\\" The sessions began with a list of thefts. In 1892, Kyle was called as a witness at the inquest regarding fatalities in the Gateshead Theatre Royal fire of 1892. Eleven people were killed in a crush at the gallery door, during a panic following cries of fire. Expert witnesses, including Kyle, stated that the number of exits and lack of fire precautions made the theatre unsafe. Business and local politics Gibson Kyle was heavily involved in local business issues, including the gas lighting industry in 1859. He or his father took part in the procession of directors of the North Eastern Railway Company at the opening of Jarrow docks in 1859. In 1866 Kyle was a director of the Union Permanent Benefit Building Society, whose offices were at 93 Clayton Street, Newcastle. Kyle was regularly involved in the sale of land with development plans. For example, in 1868 he was selling 13 villa sites on 13 acres of land at the \\"east end of East Bolden.\\" He also sold buildings and he was a director of the Tyne, Wear and Tees Property Trust. For example, in 1864 he was advertising a pub, shops, houses and domestic lettings in Newcastle. He was a moneylender, too. For example, in November 1888 he was offering ¬£200,000 () to lend at 3.75 percent, and in March 1889 he had ¬£45,000 () to lend at 3.5‚Äì4 per cent. In 1868, Kyle was elected a town councillor for the West Ward of Gateshead, on a Ratepayers' Association ticket since he vowed to lower the rates, though he received both cheers and hisses when he won. In 1874 Kyle was elected as a member of Newcastle Town Council for Westgate Ward, the polling having taken place in a shed in the cattle market, where the voting numbers had been low. Career Kyle was apprenticed to his uncle John Dobson. \\"Mr Dobson did not trouble himself much about articled pupils or apprentices. He was always too full of business to give either room or time for the purely elementary education of beginners. Mr Dobson insisted on some proficiency and fitness in those he employed. He was always approachable to his assistants ... He often said, If you err, err on the side of strength. He had a horror of shams, and warned young men of the dangers attending flimsy and cheap construction.\\" Kyle worked alongside Dobson and Richard Grainger, and was Grainger's foreman when some of their major works were carried out. Between them, they changed the face of Newcastle by demolishing and rebuilding. When they built the Central Station, Kyle was clerk of works. With Dobson he built \\"a magnificent pile of buildings on the Quayside,\\" as well as other buildings in the city, including a training college and other public buildings. Kyle's first office as an independent architect was at 16 Market Street, then in May 1865 he moved to 2 St Nicholas' Buildings, Newcastle. By March 1892 he was working from 130 Pilgrim Street, Newcastle. Kyle was appointed architect to the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral, and he designed a \\"large number of churches\\" in the area. He was a \\"stickler for thoroughness,\\" he was one of the founders of the Northern Architectural Association, and when young he was a \\"keen politician.\\" His Newcastle Daily Chronicle obituary said, > \\"There are none to whom the saying that their works live after them is more > appropriate than the great architect, for though his most durable monuments > pass away, they remain to exercise influence for many years, speaking to > those who gaze upon them.\\" In 1869 at Kyle's office in St Nicholas Buildings, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tom Bell aged 23, one of Kyle's assistants, fell through a skylight and was severely injured. He had been looking out of an upstairs window when he climbed out onto a skylight to retrieve a pen. The skylight gave way, and he dropped 40 feet into the lobby. He was \\"greatly stunned\\" and badly cut with broken glass. He was treated at the Infirmary, then taken home by his sisters.

Oswald designed Newcastle General Hospital (formerly the workhouse hospital) in 1870. He was father of architect Joseph Oswald (1851‚Äì1930) who designed the Central Arcade, and Newcastle Breweries' head office in Newgate Street. One of Kyle's last assistants was James Newton Fatkin (c.1882‚Äì1940), who also came from Ponteland. After Kyle's death, Fatkin acquired and developed the business, designing flats at 63 Fern Avenue, Eslington terrace and Osborne Avenue, Newcastle. He designed \\"numerous cinemas throughout the North,\\" and during World War II converted basements into air raid shelters. Joseph G. Angus of Low Fell (b.Gateshead 1842), Births Sep 1842 Angus Joseph George Gateshead XXIV 120 a member of the leather and rubber manufacturing family of Grainger Street West, was articled as an architect to Gibson Kyle. But \\"he was too fond of agricultural pursuits to settle down to plan drawing,\\" so he emigrated to Natal around 1875, and farmed there. Works in association with John Dobson =King Street ‚Äì Queen Street block, Akenside Hill, circa 1863= The block on the left burnt down in 1867, and was rebuilt This is the triangular block bounded to the north by Akenside Hill, to the south by Queens Street and to the east by the upper stepped end of King Street. On 20 December 1867 this new Italian-style block, worth ¬£9,000 () to ¬£10,000 (), designed by Gibson and Kyle as part of Newcastle's Quayside improvement scheme, burnt down in a great fire. > The fire was first discovered in the premises of Messrs Bell and Dunn, > shiphandlers and hardwaremen, where a considerable quantity of very > combustible material was stowed away, consisting of hemp, tar, rosin, and > other articles usually sold by ship chandlers. Soon the premises were in a > complete blaze, and the fire extended, spreading right and left, to the > offices of Mr Southern, timber merchant, 9 Queen Street; Mr J.

Brown, merchants; and Messrs Forster, Blackett and Wilson, lead > merchants, Queen Street, and others. This event occurred on the same spot as a previous explosion and fire of 1854. No-one was hurt on this occasion, and several heroic acts were reported, including that of plumber Caleb Jobling (1823‚Äì1869), Deaths Dec 1869 Jobling Caleb 46 Newcastle T. 10b 42 who was \\"very active in the dangerous task of breaking off the connections of the roofs by which the fire was prevented from spreading to the adjoining buildings.\\" Independent works =Durham Diocesan Training School (extension), 1856‚Äì1858= St Hild and St Bede College, 2017 On 28 May 1856 Kyle was calling for tenders from prospective builders of this extension, which involved \\"erection of the principal's residence, and forming additional dormitories &c.;, in present building.\\" Because it was completed in the same period, Kyle is likely to have designed the Model School which was attached to the main building for teaching experience purposes. In 1858 the Durham Diocesan Female Training School (later called the College of St Hild) was opened close by. The architect of St Hild is unknown. This unlisted building extended by Kyle was known as the Durham Diocesan Training School for Masters between 1839 and 1886 when it was renamed Bede College. It trained elementary school masters, and by 1860 the numbers of pupils had increased from five to fifty. The College of St Hild and St Bede is now part of Durham University. =Former Methodist New Connexion Chapel and schoolroom, Ripon, 1859= Kyle called for tenders on 24 May 1859, for \\"a new chapel and school room for the Methodist New Connexion, in the city of Ripon. in 1877 this building in Cemetery Road was demolished and replaced by the larger Melbourne Terrace Chapel, designed by Edward Taylor of York. =Methodist New Connexion Chapel, Hartlepool, 1859‚Äì1860= On 29 October 1859 the foundation stone for this chapel was laid by Mrs Joseph Love, wife of benefactor Joseph Love of Willington Hall, Greater Willington. There was a \\"large and respectable\\" procession from the Freemasons' Hall, Hartlepool, and a \\"large gathering\\" at the site. There had been special trains booked for the guests, and seating platforms and banners had been set up. There was hymn- singing, a speech and a tea. Kyle's design, seating 800 people, was \\"an elegant structure,\\" and \\"somewhat Byzantine in character.\\" It measured 70 by 42 feet, and included classrooms, schoolrooms and vestries. In the gallery behind the pulpit was an organ by Nicholson of Newcastle. The chapel was opened for services on Easter Sunday, 8 April 1860. There was a \\"spacious lecture hall\\" under the chapel, and a fund-raising bazaar was held there between 9 and 11 April. There were special sermons by guest speaker Rev. S. Hulme of Leeds on the following Sunday, and the public tea was held on Monday 16 April in the chapel's lecture hall. =Methodist New Connexion Chapel, Spennymoor, 1860‚Äì1861= The foundation stone for the Methodist New Connexion Chapel at Spennymoor, Durham, was laid on 10 April 1860 \\"before a large assemblage\\" by benefactor Joseph Love of Durham. This was another of Kyle's designs. Rev. John Stokes preached, and the tea was provided by Tudhoe Ironworks. =Former Primitive Methodist Chapel, Durham, 1860‚Äì1861= This building, later called the Jubilee Primitive Methodist Chapel, replaced a previous 1825 chapel in Silver Street, Durham, at a cost of ¬£1,900 () to ¬£2,000 (). The building committee, naming Kyle as architect, called for tenders for this work to be received by 21 July 1860. This second chapel was in North Road, on a plot extending between the New North Road and Crossgate. The laying of the foundation stone by Solicitor General Sir William Atherton MP, on 22 October 1860, was a major event involving a procession from the town hall and a crowd of 2,000 people. The building was opened in October 1861, although the celebrating began on 19 May. The building \\"held 600, had galleries on 3 sides and boasted a starlight with 51 gas jets suspended from the ceiling.\\" In 1959‚Äì1961 the Jubilee Chapel congregation was merged with Bethel Church and renamed North Road Methodist Church. Kyle's 1861 building was demolished in 1961.Durham County Record Office, Ref. M/DDV 635 =New Connexion Methodist Chapel, Jarrow, 1861= The foundation stone of this New Connextion Methodist Chapel near Ormonde Street at Jarrow was laid on 3 June 1861 by Matthew Stainton of South Shields. Kyle designed it to accommodate 300 people on the ground floor. Either side of the entrance hall were a classroom and vestry. The design was of \\"Italian character.\\" It had: > \\"... pressed bricks to the walling, and molded brick cornices, string- > courses &c.; The entrance doorway [was] well recessed, and, with the various > windows, [had] arched heads. The interior [was] fitted up with open benches > of stained and varnished deal, arranged so as to rise by easy steps from the > level of the preacher's platform. The organ and choristers [were] placed on > a gallery over the entrance and vestry. =Former Free Methodist chapel and schools, Newcastle, 1861= Kyle called for tenders for this building in 1861. It is possibly a red brick rebuild of the 1799 Lower Street Chapel, sold by the Wesleyans to the United Methodist Free Church in 1863. It closed in 1939, and was demolished. =Connexion Chapel at Witton Gilbert, 1861= Witton Gilbert Methodist Chapel, 2006 It is likely that this is the present Wesleyan Chapel at Witton Gilbert, also known as Witton Gilbert Methodist Chapel, which in the 19th century was used by the United Methodists. It is on the north side of the B6312 road, where it branches northward from Front Street. The Witton Gilbert chapel was opened with an \\"overflowing congregation\\" on Sunday 15 December 1861. The stone building was designed in the \\"early pointed period of ecclesiastical architecture.\\" The porch has a \\"pointed doorway with trefoil arch opening, splayed jambs, moulded labels, &c.; The gable fronting the street is pierced with pointed arch window openings, having splayed dressings. The interior fittings [were] of Petersburg pine, wrought, stained and varnished. A platform [was] provided in the recess of the rear gable, to answer for public meetings as well as for the usual Sunday services. Adjoining the chapel [was] a vestry, with an entrance from the porch.\\" Kyle was credited with the design, and James Smith was the builder. =Former Wesley Chapel, Prudhoe Street, Newcastle, 1861‚Äì1862= The Wesley Chapel was a replacement for the smaller Wesley Chapel in Bridge Street. This new one was designed by Kyle for the United Free Methodists at a cost of ¬£3,500. It was built near the police station at the east end of Prudhoe Street. The foundation stone was laid on 3 December 1861 by John Reay of Wallsend, who was presented with a silver trowel. A \\"large number\\" of people came to the ceremony. In his speech, Reay said that he had been a Methodist for over fifty years, he had laid foundation stones for more than ten chapels, and he was a trustee for sixteen schools and chapels. A time capsule in the form of a bottle was placed under the cornerstone, containing a \\"local newspaper, names of the elected trustees, architect and contractors, a copy of the circuit plan, and of a placard announcing the event, and a small coin of the realm.\\" A \\"large company\\" of perhaps 2,000 people attended the \\"public soir√©e,\\" or tea, which followed at the New Town Hall. The chapel was opened for services to \\"numerous congregations\\" on 17 September 1862. It was designed for a congregation of 800 in the \\"Italian Gothic style of architecture.\\" It had two porches giving access to the galleries. On the ground floor were lecture rooms, classrooms to seat 200 children, and vestries. It was \\"built with moulded bricks and white-stone dressings to openings, cornices, tablings &c; ... The whole of the interior woodwork was of Petersburg pine, stained and varnished. Fresh air [was] admitted through the cast-iron columns that support[ed] the galleries, and through ventilators in the walls. The chapel and schoolrooms [were] warmed by hot water apparatus ... Four starlights and ventilating tubes [were] placed in the ceiling of the chapel.\\" Wilson and Berry contracted for the joinery and carpentry, and J. Kyle contracted the mason work. The Building News reported: > It is one of the finest specimens of the combination of art with utility > which the modern architectural revival has given to Newcastle ... The > prevalent red-brick front has been most judiciously relieved by the stone > dressings; and the windows, to the mullions of which a very dark tint has > been given, are most effectively placed with regard to utility, both for > illuminating purposes and architectural effect. In the interior also, the > decorations harmonise well with the various fittings; the panels of the > gallery which run round the building have received a share of decoration > which is too often denied to the same portion of other churches; and the > pulpit, which like the gallery, is of light, polished pinewood, has its > carved panels elegantly inlaid with crimson. The columns which support the > gallery are of iron, and furnish another example of the successful > application of that metal in architecture. In the 1970s, Prudhoe Street was demolished, and the Eldon Square Shopping Centre was built in its place. =Choppington Parsonage, Morpeth, 1867= Choppington Church, with vicarage (right) Kyle called for tenders for the erection of Choppington parsonage, near Morpeth, Northumberland, in April and May 1867. The church itself was designed by Joseph Clarke of London, architect to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. It was intended for the local mining community. When newly built, the church stood \\"on an eminence to the south- east side of the northern turnpike, on the Willow Bridge Farm ... [and was] pleasantly situated, situated as it [was], surrounded by a plantation, through which access [had] been made to the [church] building. The \\"new parsonage house for the incumbent\\" was built after the 1866 church and on its east side, and the Ecclesiastical Commission voted ¬£1,400 () from the Queen Anne's Bounty, for construction. =Former Angus & Co. warehouse, Grainger Street, Newcastle, 1867‚Äì1868= Angus & Col. warehouse, 1868 In April 1867, Kyle was calling for tenders for \\"different works to be done in erecting shops, offices, four-storey warehouse &c.; in St John's Lane (later re-named Grainger Street West), Newcastle. This warehouse, founded on 3 September 1867, and opened on 26 August 1868, and built for India-rubber dealer George Angus, was next to the old Savings Bank. The Angus warehouse is now demolished; the site is now 27 Grainger Street West. It was part of a development called the St John's Lane Improvements, between Grainger Street and Westgate Street. This direct route between Newcastle railway station and the city centre had previously been \\"narrow and inconvenient,\\" with its \\"beggarly and ricketty\\" houses which contained a \\"broad block of buildings that were a hotbed and receptacle of fevers and other epidemic diseases,\\" and a \\"population of the lowest class.\\" The development, to be known as Grainger Street West, would join Grainger Street to the railway station via a \\"broad carriage road and footpaths.\\" The rebuild was, however, delayed, causing \\"great complaints\\" because no-one initially wanted to move premises there. Finally leather factor and merchant George Angus & Co., acquired a L-shaped site and built this three-storey warehouse next to the pre-existing Savings Bank. The foundation stone was laid on 3 September 1867. The time capsule inside the cornerstone contained local daily papers, coins of the realm, and the following document: > This stone was laid on Tuesday, the 3rd day of September, in the year 1867. > It forms the foundation of the first block of buildings erected on the site > of old St John's Lane, at the expense of Geo. Angus Esq., proprietor. It was > designed by Mr. Gibson Kyle, contracted for by Mr. Robert Robson and Messrs. > J. and W. Lowry, and superintended by Mr T. Alderson, clerk of the works. > The foundation stone was laid by John Henry Angus, eldest son of the > proprietor., Sept. 3, 1867. Newcastle on Tyne. Following the ceremony there was a dinner with speeches and toasts. During the excavations for the foundations, some groundworkers contracted by Mr Robson dug too deeply at , and too close to the premises of Mr Bremner, a pork butcher in Scotch Arms Yard. At nearly midnight on 17 July 1868 the premises of Mr Bremner, and the end of the house of Mr Ritson next door, had \\"fallen into Mr Angus' building.\\" Bremner sued for ¬£28 5s 6d. The new build was \\"extensive and beautiful.\\" In the manner of 19th century city warehouses, the decorative front of the building was for sales, and the back was for manufacture and deliveries. The three factory and storage areas at the rear measured by , and there was also a cellar, a glass-roofed counting house and a tan works. The front ground floor was a shop, selling India rubber and gutta- percha. The front upper floors contained office rental space at the front, a \\"display of dressed and fancy French leathers\\" on the first floor and (temporarily) a belt and hose piping factory on the second floor. Next to the building, on the Bigg Market side, a plot containing a large tannery works was purchased for Angus' new hose belt factory. There were 70‚Äì80 employees working on the main site. The Newcastle Journal reported that the commercial French Gothic frontage was \\"noble and pleasing ... tastefully ornamented with carved stone.\\" The Newcastle Daily Chronicle said it was Italian Gothic. The windows gave the upstairs offices \\"an abundance of light.\\" The Newcastle Journal said: > The front is tastefully ornamented with designs in carved stone. The > ornaments of the lower row of capitals consist of oak leaves and acorns, and > wild hemlock, and are emblematic principally of the leather trade, in which > those productions are used. There are also carvings of polyanthuses, > columbine, fern, rose, passion flower, vine, &c.; The building has three > dormer windows, finished with carved finials. Over the entrance is a bull's > head, the crest of the firm. The corbels and capitals in front are > remarkably well finished. The material is all of stone, of a remarkably hard > and durable character, and has been brought from Wide Open and Brunton > Quarries. The architect is Mr Gibson Kyle, of this town. The carving is by > Mr Curry, and is a work of art.\\" At the opening there was a \\"sumptuous\\" dinner in the warehouse cellar for a \\"large number of visitors,\\" including 70 workmen. The bells of St John's and St Andrew's rang merry peals, and the proceedings were jubilant. Gibson Kyle was listed among the guests, but the architectural sculptor Curry was not. The Newscastle Journal reported: > The pillars supporting the upper floor were wreathed with ivy and other > evergreens; and numbers of flags were suspended from the roof and sides of > the warehouse. One of the flags bore the coat of arms of the firm - a bull's > head on a blue ground, with the words Fortis est veritas. A great curiosity > was a half of the hide of a hippopotamus, which was hung against the > southern wall. It weighed , and was thick in the centre. The hide of the > hippopotamus, it appears, is an article of commerce, and is used for > machinery purposes. This extraordinary article was surmounted by the > appropriate adage, Nothing like leather. =Parsonage, Rookhope, 1868= On 9 July 1858, Kyle called for tenders for the construction of a parsonage at Rookhope, Durham. It is now a hotel, known as Rookhope Vicarage.Image of Rookhope Vicarage =Former School at United Methodist Free Church, Willington Quay, Newcastle, 1869= The foundation stone for this school, designed by Kyle for 250 children at a cost of ¬£400 (), was laid on 2 March 1869. The building was completed on 5 September in the same year, \\"the work of erection having been ... vigorously prosecuted.\\" It was a stone and brick extension of the chapel's east end, in the \\"Early English style of architecture.\\" The builders were Batey and Stevens of Willington, Newcastle. In celebration, there were special services in the chapel on 5 September, and on 6 September there was an afternoon tea and a public meeting attended by ministers and gentlemen. One purpose of this meeting may have been to arrange further finance, since the church still owed ¬£200 () for the building works. The school received an average attendance of 239 pupils. The chapel and school survived until at least 1890 when they were shown on an Ordnance Survey map. They have since been domolished. =Chaucer Buildings, 53‚Äì61 Grainger Street, Newcastle, 1869= Chaucer Buildings (centre), 1869 Chaucer Buildings at 53‚Äì61 Grainger Street, Newcastle, is a Grade II listed building. It was built as a Freemasons' hall, together with shops and offices. The style is Venetian Gothic. It has carved capitals, carved ornaments above the windows, and a crocketed gable with a curved finial. =Former South Shields Tabernacle, Laygate Lane, South Shields, 1869‚Äì1870= Laygate Baptist Tabernacle with its ministers, before 1914 Kyle called for tenders from builders, to erect a Baptist chapel in South Shields, with a deadline of 9 July 1869. On Wednesday 28 October 1870, the foundation stone was laid by Mrs Archibald Stevenson for the South Shields Tabernacle, in Laygate Lane, South Shields. The building was erected with stone dressings in the \\"Italian style of architecture.\\" At by it accommodated 750 to 800 people. It had galleries, a platform, and a pulpit at the east end. It was designed by Kyle at a cost of ¬£2,000 (). There was a plan for schools to be added at a later date. The building is now demolished. =Wallsend United Methodist Free Church, 1871= In December 1870, Kyle was calling for tenders for \\"enlarging, partially rebuilding and re-seating\\" work on Wallsend United Methodist Church. =Public restaurant, South Shields (alterations), 1886= This premises was altered by Kyle, and taken over in 5 Market Place, South Shields, by the Public Restaurant Company, a restaurant chain previously known as the Penny Diner System. The customer base was working men and the poor, and the principle was that \\"by a little arrangement and contrivance, food could be provided of a good and substantial character at very much cheaper rates than was generally done.\\" Although the object was, \\"the good they could do, rather than the profit they could make,\\" the company was nevertheless turning a small profit. Soup and bread at this restaurant cost a penny. The company aimed soon to provide \\"dinners of two courses at the price of sixpence.\\" =Central Hall, Blyth (extensions and alterations), 1892= Kyle called for tenders from builders, for the extension and alteration of the Central Hall, Blyth, in March 1892. At that point he was working from 130 Pilgrim Street, Newcastle. =Tenements, Pilgrim Street, Newcastle, 1893= Kyle's plans to build lodging houses and single-room tenements in Pilgrim Street were chosen on 2 March 1893, following a prize competition held by Newcastle's Town Improvement Committee. A description of the plans for the tenements appeared in the Newcastle Daily Chronicle two days later. > The elevation of the building, although necessarily of a plain character, is > relieved by pleasant architectural features. The grouping of the windows, > and the arrangement of the general mass of the building, present a > successful effort to secure a picturesque effect in an essentially > untilitarian structure. There are to be 50 tenements, each possessing from > 226 square feet to 236 square feet, this area being exclusive of bed recess. > The main entrance, nine feet wide, is about the centre of the block from > which a six foot wide fire-proof concrete staircase is approached. The > superintendent's office will be so placed as to overlook the entrance. The > access to all the tenements and out offices is from cement concrete > galleries and landings at rear of the buildings, an arrangement which is > intended to give privacy to the main frontage, which is three stories high. > Each tenant will have a separate entrance lobby as a protection from the > weather. Efficient ventilators, improved sash windows and hinged fanlights > over the doors are to be constructed. The gas lighting will be under the > care of the superintendent, and during the day-time each tenement will be > amply lighted by means of a double window. A coal bunker, bed recess and > sink are provided to every tenement. The attic floor is entirely open for > clothes drying in wet weather, and is amply lighted and ventilated. The > lavatories, dust-bins and wash-houses are placed 20ft to the rear of the > main building, and an access for carts into the yard is provided for in Mr > Kyle's plan. Tenements were becoming known for overcrowding of the poor by 1900 due to developing social conditions, but in 1893 this one was designed for single occupancy. Pilgrim Street had been an important medieval street, but the south side was replaced when the Swan House roundabout and internal motorway were built in 1967. It is not known whether this tenement building still exists. =Tenements and lodging houses, Millers Hill, Newcastle, 1893= in 1893 Kyle designed a block of 50 tenements for married couples, and a lodging house for women, in Miller's Hill, Newcastle, winning first prize in a competition for plans at Newcastle Town Hall. Having inspected the exhibition of plans, the Newcastle Daily Chronicle reported: > The Miller's Hill will almost certainly be improved by the erections to be > built from the prime designs that were yesterday on view. It would be almost > impossible to imagine neater buildings than those contemplated. The front > elevation of the 50 tenements shows an exceedingly charming block, with a > wide entrance, pretty windows, and an altogether tasteful front. The > appearance of the lodging house for women is also very neat, and gains in > attractiveness from the bay window provided for above the entrance ... The > first place was awarded to the fine designs of Mr Gibson Kyle, 130 Pilgrim > Street, Newcastle ... The cost of the Miller's Hill lodging house is to be > ¬£7,000 (). =Former Newcastle Lunatic Asylum baths and wash houses, 1894= Newcastle Corporation employed Kyle and met in the Town Hall on 3 April 1894, to arrange a loan of ¬£10,000 () for a baths and wash houses extension to the city mental hospital. =Former Gallowgate Corporation Baths, Newcastle, 1896= Public Baths, 1896 The Corporation Baths in Gallowgate was Kyle's last work, opened on 10 August 1896. He won the commission for this in open competition. This building replaced previous baths and wash-houses at the corner of Newgate Street, demolished to facilitate the widening of Gallowgate. The building was \\"very neat and tasteful,\\" in the \\"English style of architecture.\\" It had a frontage and a baths entrance in Gallowgate, and a frontage in Strawberry Lane. It was constructed of \\"Ruabon red pressed bricks and stone from the Dunhouse Quarry, near Barnard Castle ... The men's first class bath hall [was] provided with eight fire clay baths and two shower baths. The second class hall [had] eight baths and two shower baths,\\" with room for more. There were similar first and second-class facilities for women, plus \\"other apartments.\\" There was a wash-house entrance in Strawberry Lane, the wash-house having \\"36 compartments, fitted with all the most modern steam and other appliances, required in such places. It was opened by Alderman R.H. Holmes, JP, who was given a \\"gold key\\" by Kyle. Holmes said that \\"such a place was not opened as a business investment; it was opened solely to promote cleanliness, to meet the necessity of the working class population; and he referred to the benefits that such an institution, especially the wash-house department, was calculated to confer on those who used it.\\" This building was demolished in 1972, and the site is now a car park.

In 2019 Ozon was named one of the top-5 most valuable Russian internet companies by Forbes. Ozon is part of Ozon Group, which also owns the online travel booking platform Ozon.Travel and a stake in Russia's largest digital bookstore Litres. The current CEO of Ozon is Alexander Shulgin, who joined the company after serving as CFO and later COO of Yandex.  History  Ozon.ru was established in 1998 as an online bookseller by the Russian software house Reksoft. The company soon expanded its assortment to CDs and DVDs before going on to sell a wide range of goods from clothing to electronics. In 2012, Ozon acquired the shoe seller Sapato.ru and sold it in 2015 to the online fashion retailer KupiVIP. In 2014, Ozon acquired a stake in Litres, the leader in Russia's e-book market. = Leadership = After a series of Russian CEOs, in 2005 Ozon appointed Bernard Lukey, who had advised the company on behalf of Baring Vostok. In 2011 Maelle Gavet became the new CEO of Ozon, prompting comparisons to the \\"Jeff Bezos of Russia.\\" During Gavet's tenure, Ozon worked to popularize e-commerce in the mainly cash-based Russian retail market. Gavet stepped down as CEO in 2015, with her deputy Danny Perekalsky appointed as her successor. Since 2017 the CEO of Ozon is Alexander Shulgin, the former CFO and COO of the Russian tech company Yandex. = Funding = In 1999, ru-Net Holdings, founded by Leonid Boguslavsky along with the Western Baring Vostok Group, UFG and Rex Capital, purchased a controlling stake in the company for $3 million. In 2000, Baring Vostok became a controlling shareholder in Ozon after investing $3 million into the company. In 2007, Ozon raised $18 million in a funding round led by the Geneva-based Index Ventures, which had backed Skype and Dropbox. In 2011, Ozon attracted $100 million in investment from Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten, Boguslavsky's ru-Net and others in what was called the largest private investment in an electronic business in Russia at the time. This was followed by another $150 million funding deal with the Russian conglomerate Sistema and the Russian mobile operator MTS in 2014. MTS and Baring Vostok invested another $92 million into Ozon in 2018. In 2019, Boguslavsky sold his share in Ozon to the company's main shareholders, Baring Vostok and Sistema, for $70 million. In 2019 Ozon secured a $150 million round of financing with the participation of U.S. venture capital firm Princeville Capital, in what was reported to be one of the largest Russian tech investment deals involving Western backers since 2014. = Financial performance = Ozon reported a \\"hypergrowth\\" stage in 2019 as sales for the year increased by 93% to $1.1 billion and the volume of orders more than doubled to 32.2 million. Company turnover by gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew 188% year on year in the second quarter of 2020 and reached RUB 77.4 billion by H12020, an increase of 152% from the same period in the previous year. According to Ozon CFO Daniil Fedorov, the coronavirus pandemic created a new habit of shopping online among Russian consumers.  Products and services  Ozon offers more than 5 million products across more than 20 product categories including clothing, groceries, home goods and electronics. After a large assortment expansion, the volume of orders on Ozon more than doubled in 2019 to 32.2 million. In early 2019, the company launched a service called Ozon.Invest that grants loans to small and medium-sized businesses that sell their products on the Ozon marketplace. Ozon was also the first online retailer in Russia to launch consumer loans for multi-category online purchases, as well as its own debit card with a cashback feature. Ozon has been operating a marketplace platform for third-party sellers since 2018. In June 2020, the marketplace had more than 13,000 sellers who accounted for more than 85% of the assortment on Ozon.  Supply chain and delivery  Ozon developed its own fulfillment infrastructure to deliver orders across Russia's 11 time zones. In 2018 the company had seven fulfillment centers in the Moscow region as well as St. Petersburg, Tver, Kazan, Ekaterinburg, Rostov-On-Don and Novosibirsk. Ozon more than doubled its fulfilment capacity in 2019 to almost 200,000 sqm, as well as investing in its last-mile delivery infrastructure. The company operates its own delivery logistics platform and has a network of over 16,000 pickup points, including automated parcel lockers across Russia, reportedly making it the biggest parcel locker network in the country. The use of brick- and-mortar pickup points where customers can pick up their orders arose out of a lack of reliable third-party delivery services in many parts of Russia. In 2019, Ozon launched an express grocery delivery service in Moscow. The same year the company rolled out its contactless home delivery service, which became a popular option for customers during the coronavirus pandemic in the spring of 2020.

History The Shemsedin Kirjatani House is typical of the area, including two floors and a basement, but was limited by lack of funds to only half a second floor. A central porch on the ground floor serves as the entrance. A hallway leads from the porch to three rooms and the stairs up to the unfinished first floor‚Äôs lobby and east room. The building‚Äôs foundation, basement, and ground floor up to are made from stone with lime mortar, but the walls from there up consist of the wood-studded brick known as bondruk. Three gutters are covered by the roof tiles above the ground floor, while four top the first. The fa√ßade includes some symmetrical elements but is unusual for the area. Elaborate interior features include the geometrically decorated ceilings as well as wooden moldings on those and the windows and cupboards. Mirrors brought from Turkey by a barber owner are a highlight. Entry is through the main gate and a cobblestone courtyard including a mutfaku (fountain) dating to construction. A channel of river stone in front of the house funneled water needed there through the neighboring yards. Recent additions include an annex built in the 1970s on the northwestern side with the current kitchen and bathroom, as well as a renovation of the roof funded by the Kosovo Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports in 2011.
