The peak lies in the southern part of the Hida Mountains (Northern Alps) of Japan, on the border of Ōmachi and Matsumoto in Nagano Prefecture and Takayama in Gifu Prefecture. The priest Banryū (1786–1840) founded a temple there.  History  * July 28, 1828 - Banryū first climbed the mountain. * 1878 - William Gowland became the first non-Japanese man to climb to the top. * August, 1891 - Englishman Walter Weston climbed to the top. * 1922 - Japanese mountaineer Maki Yūkō made the first winter ascent of the mountain. * December 20, 1959 - Senshu University mountain staff is climbing Kitakama (北鎌) Ridge when an avalanche occurs, 9 people were killed.  Outline  Mount Yari is located in the Chūbu-Sangaku National Park. The name derives from its shape, which resembles a spear (槍 yari) thrust into the sky. Because of its shape, it is also called the Matterhorn of Japan. Ridges and valleys reach out from this pyramid-shaped mountain in all directions. The four ridges are Higashikama (東鎌), Yarihotaka (槍穂高), Nishikama (西鎌) and Kitakama (北鎌) to the east, south, west and north, respectively. The four valleys are Yarizawa (槍沢), Hidazawa or Yaridaira (飛騨沢 or 槍平), Senjōzawa (千丈沢) and Tenjōzawa (天丈沢) to the southeast, southwest, northwest and northeast, respectively. During the hiking season, Mount Yari is popular with mountain climbers. One of the most infamous ridges is Kitakama. It became known through its association with mountaineer , who was a model for the novel Kokō no Hito (孤高の人) by Jirō Nitta. The disaster of told in Fūsetsu no Bibāku (風雪のビバーク Snowstorm Bivouac) also contributed to its fame. Despite the existence of variation routes, climbers stand in line for the famous routes during the summer. In the autumn of 2005, a new mountain trail was constructed going up from Hidarimata Valley (左俣谷 Hidarimata-dani) to Mount Okumaru (奥丸山 Okumaru-yama). This made it possible to reach Yari-ga-take walking from Shinhodaka onsen upstream along the Hidarimata Valley following the mountain ridge of Mount Okumaru. Two triangulation points were established at the summit. A milepost stone is fixed to the ground. As a reference point for the Geographical Survey Institute of Japan, it is of little importance and even on topographic maps, the summit of Yari-ga-take appears merely as an elevation point.  Surroundings  There are several mountain huts in the vicinity of the mountain: Yari-ga-take Sansō (槍ヶ岳山荘), Sesshō Hut (殺生ヒュッテ), Hut Ōyari (ヒュッテ大槍), Yarisawa Lodge (槍沢ロッジ), Yaridaira-goya (槍平小屋) and Wasabidaira- goya (わさび平小屋). Being situated in the Japanese Alps, several prominent mountains can be reached from Mount Yari, among them: Sugoroku-dake (双六岳), Nishi-dake (西岳), Ōgui-dake (大喰岳), Naka-dake (中岳), Minami-dake (南岳), Okumaru- yama (奥丸山).

The Piedmontese army won the battle, as the Austrians were unable to break through to relieve the siege of Peschiera and prevent its surrender which happened on the day before the battle. Background Having evacuated Milan after the Five Days of Milan on 22 March 1848, field marshal Radetzky regrouped his forces in the Quadrilatero, composed of the four supporting fortresses of Peschiera, Mantua, Verona and Legnago. The Piedmontese army advanced across Lombardy, brushing aside the covering forces under major general Wohlgemuth guarding the bridge over the Mincio at Goito during an engagement on 9 April 1848.Embree, Radetzky, p. 88-92. The Austrians tried but failed to destroy the Goito bridge. Once across the Mincio, the Piedmontese forces fanned out towards the north and south. On 10 April 1848, the Piedmontese army started to blockade the fortress of Peschiera, garrisoned by ca. 1,700 Austrian troops. Until the siege train arrived, the lack of siege guns hampered the effectiveness of the bombardment. Out of food after 34 days of blockade and 16 days under siege, the Austrians surrendered the fortress on 29 May 1848, just prior to the battle of Goito.Embree, Radetzky, p. 128-137. Meanwhile, Piedmontese and Austrian forces clashed in the battle of Pastrengo on 30 April 1848 on the Rivoli plateau. The first big test of arms occurred just outside Verona during the battle of Santa Lucia on 6 May 1848 where the Piedmontese army failed to defeat the Austrians. With a bloody nose, the Piedmontese army retired to the Mincio. Unable to dislodge the Papal forces at Vicenza, field marshal Radetzky decided to concentrate his forces against the Piedmontese army. On 28 May 1848, he marched his army towards Mantua where a Tuscan Division was warily observing the fortress. While the Piedmontese army's attention was diverted by an Austrian brigade on the Rivoli plateau on 28 and 29 May 1848, field marshal Radetzky engaged and defeated the Tuscan division at the battle of Curtatone and Montanara on 29 May 1848.Embree, Radetzky, p. 138-148. Many of the defeated and disillusioned Tuscan volunteers returned home, marking the end of the Tuscan division as a fighting force. Both the Piedmontese and the Austrian armies were now concentrated on the Mincio side of the Quadrilatero: the Piedmontese south of Peschiera, the Austrians in control of Mantua. Radetzky sent his troops north to relieve Peschiera. The battle From Mantua, Radetzky sent his First and Reserve Corps towards Goito, while his Second Corps and the cavalry were ordered to reconnoiter towards Ceresara.The narrative follows Embree, Radetzky, p. 148-153. See there for further sources. The Piedmontese forces were deployed in two lines. The first line stretched from the banks of the Mincio at Goito westwards. The second line occupied heights above Goito. At around 14:00 on 30 May 1848, the cavalry vedettes of both sides established contact. Brigade Benedek leading First Corps advanced from Sacca towards Goito, coming under artillery fire from the Italian guns on the Somenzari heights at 15:30. The Austrians deployed their own artillery (12 guns and 3 rocket tubes) but were unable to break the Italian artillery superiority. Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, displayed personal bravery by exposing himself to the enemy artillery fire, gaining a scratch wound in the process. While Brigade Benedek remained pinned before Goito, Brigades Wohlgemuth and Strassoldo advanced on his left, brushing aside the feeble opposition (which even fired on its own troops). To stem the Austrian progress, General Bava sent forward the Guards Brigade (on the right) and Aosta Brigade (on the left) at 17:00. The progress of the Guards Brigade was checked by Brigade Gyulai of the Second Corps which was in the process of linking up with the First Corps. Aosta Brigade pressured Brigade Wohlgemuth to withdraw. Brigade Benedek retired too when it was attacked by Neapolitan reinforcements. With darkness approaching at 19:00, both sides withdrew to their initial positions. Around this time, the King of Sardinia received the message about the Austrian surrender of Peschiera, ending the battle with the Italians in general jubilation. Intense rainfall prevented all combat operations during the next day. Informed about the surrender of Peschiera and unable to overcome the Piedmontese army, field marshal Radetzky withdrew his forces on 2 June 1848. The Piedmontese lost 46 killed, 260 wounded and 55 missing in action at the battle of Goito. Austrian casualties were 2 officers and 65 men killed, general Felix Schwarzenberg and 18 officers and 311 men wounded, 2 officers captured, as well as 1 officer and 185 men missing in action. Outcome The battle was a tactical draw, neither side managing to overcome the other; however, the Piedmontese army had fought defensively and had retained control of the field of battle, and prevented field marshal Radetzky from relieving Peschiera, therefore the battle is to be considered as an Italian victory. It lulled however the Piedmontese command into a sense of complacency, which, coupled with the lack of a clear strategical plan, would eventually allow Radetzki to overcome this failure, resume the offensive (proving this in the battle of Vicenza against the Papal forces on 10 June 1848) and eventually deal a decisive defeat to the Sardinian Army at the battle of Custoza.

Prelude The Austrian forces were deployed in a way that threatened any Piedmontese attack against the fortress of Peschiera del Garda, and against Verona. Therefore, the Piedmontese High Command decided to act energetically against it to neutralize this threat, with the II Corps (commanded by General Ettore Gerbaix De Sonnaz), supported by the reserve division.Pieri, p. 210 Although some sources claimed that the troops of the Kingdom of Sardinia were for the most part volunteers from regions of northern Italy, in fact those consisted of four brigades of the Piedmontese regular army. Among the troops at Pastrengo, there were recorded, 1,000 volunteers from Parma, 150 volunteers from Piacenza and 400 students from Pavia and Turin. The Skirmish The Piedmontese attack, while done with superior forces, was executed rather poorly, in frontal actions and without taking adequate advantage of the numerical superiority, nor with proper reconnaissance done before the battle. On the right the brigade \\"Savoia\\" proceeded slowly, hampered by the unknown terrain; on the center and right the brigades \\"Cuneo\\" and \\"Piemonte\\" met with better success, and after three hours at 14:00 the Piedmontese line began to advance. Despite attempts by the Austrian commander to delay it, the offensive proceeded up to the pontoon-bridge on the river Adige. After this success, however, the Piedmontese stopped and did not advance further.Pieri, p. 210-1 As documented by the New monthly magazine: Vol. 83, 1848: \\"On the 30th of April, what is called in the bulletin issued from the headquarters of the Sardinian army, \\"the first battle between the two armies of Italy,\\" was fought. The end proposed was to occupy Bussolengo, Pastrengo, and Piovezzana, and to attempt to force the Adige. The affair commenced at half-past eleven, A.m. The Italian troops succeeded in driving the Austrians from all the positions which they occupied at Pastrengo, and in gaining the heights which command the Adige.\\" Aftermath While a Piedmontese victory, it was not a complete success, since Field Marshal Radetzky still had full use of the vital road that connected him to Trento and the Empire; had this been cut, the Austrian situation would have become critical.Pieri, p. 211 As documented by the New monthly magazine: Vol. 83, 1848: \\"During the night of the 30th, Bussolengo was taken by the Sardinians, and the passage of the Adige effected at Pontone.\\" References Sources * Pastrengo Pastrengo Pastrengo Category:1848 in Italy Category:1848 in the Austrian Empire Category:April 1848 events ","title":"Skirmish of Pastrengo (1848)"},{"id":"9786849","title":"Lincoln County School District (Mississippi)"},{"id":"9786885","text":"Robert Walker (born 6 March 1987 in Örebro, Sweden) is a retired Swedish football player.

Since 2013, Zarnecki has been a Director of the International Space Science Institute (Berne, Switzerland). Between 2004 and 2013 he was a Professor of Space Science (now Emeritus) at the Open University, having previously been a professor and researcher at the University of Kent. Zarnecki has taken part in several high-profile space probe missions and is an expert on space debris, space dust and impacts. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2014, and became President of the Royal Astronomical Society in May 2016, having been vice-president from 2009 to 2011 and President-Elect for the year from May 2015. Early life Born and raised in Finchley, Middlesex, the son of the art historian George Zarnecki, he was educated at Highgate School in north London and was interested in space exploration from an early age. In 1961, the school gave its pupils a day off to witness the first person in space, Yuri Gagarin, visiting the tomb of Karl Marx in Highgate Cemetery nearby. Zarnecki was among those who went. First broadcast on BBC Four television on 10 April 2011. Zarnecki graduated with a BA degree in Natural Sciences from Queens' College, Cambridge in 1971 (promoted to MA in 1975). He undertook doctoral research at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Surrey and subsequently obtained a PhD degree in Physics and Astronomy from University College London in 1977.Professional biography: Professor Jan Charles Zarnecki - website of The Open University Space science In the course of his career, Zarnecki has worked on hardware for many space missions. At first, he worked for British Aerospace and was part of the team that developed the Faint Object Camera for the Hubble Space Telescope. In 1981, he moved to the University of Kent in Canterbury and became the project manager for the Dust Impact Detection System on board the Giotto probe that visited Halley's Comet. In 1988, Zarnecki was involved in plans to provide instrumentation for a proposed asteroid mission called Vesta, but, when this was dropped in favour of the Cassini–Huygens mission to Saturn and its moons, he and his team decided to use their expertise to design the Surface Science Package (SSP) for the Huygens probe. The probe would be released from the main spacecraft (Cassini) and descend to the surface of Saturn's largest moon Titan. The proposal was successful and, in 1990, Zarnecki was appointed as the SSP's Principal Investigator. The next seven years were spent assembling and testing the instrument. With only 70% of necessary funds available, Zarnecki had to be creative with the resources he was assigned. He managed to persuade a group of scientists in Poland to provide part of the instrumentation for free. One major setback came during the final stages of testing when, on 14 January 1996, the package was put through its final vibration test and its casing cracked. After some extensive redesign, the package was delivered to the European Space Agency (ESA). On 15 October 1997, Cassini-Huygens was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral. In 2000, Zarnecki, along with the rest of the SSP team, moved to the Open University in Milton Keynes. There he became involved in the ill-fated Beagle 2 mission to Mars, lost while landing in December 2003. On 25 December 2004, the Huygens probe separated successfully from Cassini and twenty-two days later, on 14 January 2005, it landed successfully on the surface of Titan. The SSP collected over three and a half hours of data, which, thanks to its efficient encoding, could be stored on a single floppy disk. The BBC Four television documentary Destination Titan, first broadcast in April 2011, focused on Zarnecki and the Huygens mission from the perspective of the mission scientists. Between 2007 and 2009, Zarnecki was the Directory of the Centre for Earth, Planetary, Space & Astronomical Research (CEPSAR) at the Open University. He is currently working as the team leader on the ExoMars mission, Europe's first Mars rover mission. He is also co-investigator on the PTOLEMY instrument for the Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Honours and appointments In 2005, Zarnecki won the Sir Arthur Clarke Award for individual achievement, for his work on the Huygens probe. The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) 2006 Laurels for Team Achievement was awarded to the Cassini-Huygens team. In 2006, Asteroid 17920 was named Zarnecki by the International Astronomical Union, in recognition of “..spacecraft instrumentation to study the surfaces and atmospheres of planets, satellites and small bodies\\".

Each piece of Welsh legislation is known as an Act of the Senedd. The first Welsh legislation to be proposed was the NHS Redress (Wales) Measure 2008. This was the first time in almost 500 years that Wales has had its own laws, since Cyfraith Hywel, a version of Celtic law, was abolished and replaced by English law through the Laws in Wales Acts, enacted between 1535 and 1542 during the reign of King Henry VIII.  Legislative competence of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament)  Both the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Act 2006 set out areas of devolved responsibility for the National Assembly for Wales (now known as the Welsh Parliament or Senedd Cymru). The 2006 Act granted the Senedd legislative competence to make laws (known then as Assembly Measures) in clearly defined \\"matters\\". In order to draft laws within its areas of responsibility, but where the powers of legislative competence have not been devolved to it, the Senedd could request these powers using a Legislative Competency Order or could receive the transfer of power and the right to make laws through parliamentary bills at Westminster. Each Order in Council for an area of legislation had to be approved by the Secretary of State for Wales, both Houses of Parliament, and the Queen in Council, in order for the Senedd to legislate in that area. Once the Queen has approved the Order, the new area of legislative competence was added to Schedule 5, Part 1 of the Government of Wales Act 2006. There is a Counsel General for Wales who oversees the approval and creation of these laws, and gives advice to the Welsh Government. The 2006 Act also included provisions which allowed for a referendum to be held on whether to grant the Senedd legislative competence to pass primary legislation which were known as \\"Acts of the Assembly\\" in all matters within twenty subject areas without the need for further Legislative Competency Orders. A referendum under these provisions was held in March 2011 and resulted in a vote in favour of granting the Senedd the competence to pass the Acts of the Assembly. Therefore, the Senedd now has the legislative competence to pass an Act of the Senedd in all twenty devolved areas. Following the devolution of legislative competence to the Senedd in some area of responsibility, it is unlikely that the UK Parliament would draw up legislation in that area without a Legislative Consent Motion being passed by the Senedd to allow them to do so (Assembly Standing Order 26). This is done to preserve the autonomy of the Senedd, and to prevent legislative confusion.  Areas to legislate: The devolved areas  The Royal Badge of Wales These areas are \\"subjects\\" where the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) can make legislation in the form of an Act of the Senedd. *Agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and rural development *Ancient monuments and historic buildings *Culture *Economic development *Education and training *Environment *Fire and rescue services and promotion of fire safety *Food *Health and health services *Highways and transport *Housing *Local government *Public administration *Senedd (Welsh Parliament) *Social welfare *Sport and recreation *Tourism *Town and country planning *Water and flood defence *Welsh language The Senedd can also legislate in areas that affect only the Senedd itself, which is why the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) field is included. However, following the passing of the Wales Act 2017 Wales has moved to a reserved powers model (similar to Scotland), which widens the areas in which the Senedd can legislate beyond those listed above.  Referendum to make Acts of the Assembly  The Welsh Assembly was initially able to make only Measures, but it was given the option to call for a referendum, with added approval from the UK Parliament, to pass Acts. This was considered as having the prospect of changing little of the Measures system, ensuring that Assembly Measures passed before the referendum would still be in force. It was considered that Measures would be a precursor to Acts. The referendum was held on 3 March 2011. The majority of the participants voted 'Yes' to the question \\"Do you want the Assembly now to be able to make laws on all matters in the 20 subject areas it has powers for?\\". Even so, future Welsh order in council laws may face veto from the UK Parliament, but the Senedd still is able to make laws in areas already devolved because once the referendum is approved, there are powers that are already in the Government of Wales Act 2006 to make laws already approved by parliament when the act was passed. The Senedd can still request to make laws in areas using the Order in Council system but if the UK Parliament wants to legislate in a devolved area, it will require a motion to be passed by the Senedd, similar to the way the Scottish Parliament works. The power to make Acts of the Senedd are called Subjects, which are listed in schedule 7, part 1 of the Government of Wales Act 2006.  English law and contemporary Welsh law  English law still applies to Wales under the present devolved settlement. Contemporary Welsh law governs the local aspects of Welsh life, whilst English law governs the more generic aspects. Because Welsh laws are ultimately derived from Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, some commentators consider this new system of laws to be another branch of English law. Unlike Scotland, for example, which has its own criminal and civil justice system, England and Wales still have a unified justice system. English law still applies in Wales, but some laws in England, about matters that are devolved in Wales, may not apply in Wales. Once the Senedd has legislative competency to legislate in an area through an Act of the Senedd, the Senedd can lead Wales down a different route, compared to English law. Some actions can be unlawful in Wales, but not in England or Scotland. For example, using an electric shock collar on a cat or dog is unlawful in Wales, but not in the rest of the United Kingdom.  Wales-only laws  There are Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament that are classed as \\"Wales-only laws\\". Each Act contains provisions for the Senedd to make subordinate legislation on. Sometimes such Acts can also confer power to the Senedd. An example of such a Wales-only law is the Transport (Wales) Act 2006. This Act allowed the National Assembly to make orders to enforce the provisions in the Act. The Act does not confer power to the Assembly to make Assembly Measures. A major difference is also the use of the Welsh language, as laws concerning it apply in Wales and not in England. The Welsh Language Act 1993 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which put the Welsh language on an equal footing with the English language in Wales with regard to the public sector. Welsh can also be spoken in Welsh courts.  Wales as a jurisdiction  As there is no criminal law within contemporary Welsh law, Wales is not generally considered a fourth jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. This is because the judiciary and the courts follow England and Wales law, which is made by the United Kingdom Parliament, and is not specific to Wales. Although Welsh law is recognised as separate in operation, this is not sufficient for Wales to constitute a separate legal jurisdiction. The One Wales agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru (2007-2011) called for a review of criminal justice matters in Wales, and the question of whether they should be devolved to Wales, proposing that a Criminal and Youth Justice System within Welsh law. Currently, however, there has been no such devolution of justice to the Welsh Parliament.One Wales agreement A commission set up in 2017 by the First Minister of Wales known as \\"The Commission on Justice in Wales\\" and chaired by Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, looked into the operation of justice in the country. It aimed to further clarify the legal and political identity of Wales within the UK constitution, which may include the creation of a distinct legal jurisdiction. The commission's report was released in October 2019 and recommended the full devolution of the justice system. This would formalise Wales as the fourth jurisdiction of the UK.

It is a landmark piece in Lesbian dramatic literature as the first mainstream play of its kind. The play follows eight women over the course of one summer on the fictional Long Island seaside town of Bluefish Cove. Set amongst a cluster of beachfront cabins traditionally rented out each summer to the same group of lesbian women, Eva, a newcomer who has left Manhattan to get time away from her husband, is unaware of the sexual orientation of her summertime neighbors. Eva’s neighbor Lil, one of seven lesbians who are making their annual pilgrimage to the Cove, and the only single woman, is likewise unaware that Eva is straight. After some initial confusion and awkward introduction, Eva and Lil end up falling in love. However, Lil – not yet 30 years old - has cancer, and is not expected to last the year. By the time she chooses to reveal this to Eva, she has become quite ill, and dies before autumn. The play focuses on the friendships and journeys of the eight women at Bluefish Cove, and was one of the first pieces of theatre to present lesbians as rounded, three dimensional characters, avoiding the problematic and homophobic tropes that had been necessary to portray queer stories on stage. Chambers' comedic dialogue, sensitivity to human nature and tender treatment of her characters help the play transcend preconceptions and show the universality of these women's journeys, whether straight or gay. Production history Originally produced by The Glines (John Glines), artistic director and Lawrence Lane, managing director, Last Summer at Bluefish Cove opened at the Actors Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, New York City, December 22, 1980 and closed March 1, 1981 after 80 performances. Cast: Jean Smart as 'Lil', Susan Slavin as 'Eva', Janet Sarno as 'Dr. Kitty', Holly Barron as 'Annie', Dulcie Arnold as 'Rita', Lauren Craig as 'Rae', Celia Howard as 'Sue' and Robin Mary Paris as 'Donna'. Other credits include Director: Nyla Lyon, Set Design: Reagan Cook, Lighting Design: Jeffrey Schissler, Costume Design: Giva R. Taylor. In Judy Miller's 1981 Los Angeles production, Jean Smart reprised the role of 'Lil\\", also featuring Lee Garlington (Rae), Camilla Carr (Kitty), Nora Heflin (Annie), Sandra J. Marshall (Eva), Dianne Turley Travis (Sue), Linda Cohen (Rita), and Shannon Kriska (Donna). The production was directed by Hilary Moshereece. The Production Stage Manager was Laurie Moore with Lighting by Dana Winkelman. It opened at the 99-seat Fountain Theater in Hollywood in 1981, running for 2.5 years, 4 nights a week to sold-out audiences. The production, its ensemble and Jean Smart won numerous awards during the run. These include the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Jean Smart for Best Actress, as well as a nomination for Best Ensemble Performance. The production won seven Hollywood Drama-Logue Awards - Production, Direction, Writing (Jane Chambers), Ensemble, Lighting, Sets and Costumes, as well as Robby Awards and Oscar Wilde Awards for all the same 7 categories, and numerous GLAAD awards. The production also received a Certificate of Outstanding Theatre from the City of Los Angeles. Jean Smart was discovered at the LA Production by the casting director for Designing Women, leading to her starring role on that successful TV series. In 1983 Judy Miller produced Bluefish at the 750 seat Theater on the Square in San Francisco featuring Susan Sullivan as Lil, under Marshall W. Mason's direction, for which it received numerous awards. The play has been performed for the past 30 years across the globe, in hundreds of college and regional productions, often to sold-out audiences. Characters Kitty- Has just left her OBGYN clinic to become a full time writer after she took the feminist world by storm with her book The Female Sexual Imperative. A force to be reckoned with in any situation, Kitty is terrified of being publicly outed, and worries that Eva’s arrival at Bluefish Cove might expose her. Rita- Kitty's wide-eyed and level headed secretary – and lover. Punctual, to-the-point, and insightful. Donna- A party girl in her early 20s who faces accusations of being a gold digger in her relationship with the older Sue. Sue- A wealthy and weathered blueblood, involved with the much younger Donna – an age difference which Sue is self- conscious about. Rae- A second-wave feminist through and through – which sometimes clashes with her stereotypically “feminine,” housewife-type sensibilities and likes. Annie- A master sculptor (or, sculptress, depending on who at Bluefish Cove you ask) who’s been involved with Rae for 10 years. Strong, Spunky, and Artistic. Lil – Sarcastic, witty, and knows how to clean a fish in her sleep. Dying of cancer, but keeping the diagnosis close to her chest. The only single lesbian at the start of the play. Eva – Caring and somewhat sheltered, Eva has just left her husband of nearly a decade at the start of the play, and is staying at Bluefish Cove unaware that it is a lesbian colony. Entering a new chapter in her life, Eva is open to new ideas and experiences – including exploring her sexuality. Plot Act One begins with a chance encounter: Lil is a regular at Bluefish Cove, fishing on the coast. Eva is a fairly naïve housewife who has just left her husband, and has rented a cottage at Bluefish Cove on a whim. Lil feels an immediate attraction for Eva, but she misunderstands Lil’s flirting as friendliness, and Lil fails to realize that Eva is straight, inviting her to a party later that night. Bluefish Cove has become somewhat of a lesbian colony, a haven for Lil and her friends. Lil is mortified upon realizing Eva is not a lesbian, but Eva doesn’t take any hints and shows up at the party. To soften the blow, Lil convinces her friends to pretend they are all straight, at least for the party. When Eva arrives, she and Kitty – who is terrified of being outed – stumble through awkward dialogue until Donna and Sue arrive. Not aware that they are supposed to be pretending to be straight, Donna and Sue exclaim that they are lesbians - and that everyone at the cove is a lesbian. Eva realizes her misunderstanding to everyone’s extreme embarrassment and leaves. Later, she returns to Lil and their attraction is actualized – they begin an affair, but Lil conceals her cancer from Eva. Act Two jumps to midsummer. Lil’s cancer has significantly progressed, and she collapses in agonizing pain. Refusing to undergo any further treatment or have any more organs removed, Lil has accepted that this summer at Bluefish Cove will be her last. It is a crushing realization to Lil that this coincides with her first real love, Eva. Still, Eva refuses to be pushed away by Lil’s tough exterior and promises to spend the rest of Lil’s time by her side. The last scene shows Lil’s friends mourning her recent death. A number of commitments have been made in her honor – Kitty decides to reopen her OBGYN practice, Eva considers renting Lil’s cabin next summer…all of the friends feel Lil’s loss, but resolve to maintain their connection to Bluefish Cove, Lil’s favorite place.

It was located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. PMA's student body hailed from 31 local cities and towns, represents 3 New England states, and 4 countries. History The school was founded in 1958. The Academy, located at 209 Lawrence St, is situated on a 22-acre campus formerly known as the Edward F. Searles Estate. In 2008, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary. In October 2016, the estate was opened up for public tours. There are other locations of the school too, like one in Nashua, NH. =October 2017 threat scare= On the afternoon of October 4, 2017, threatening messages were discovered written on a school wall by a student after school hours. This prompted a massive police response and a 1-hour delay of classes the following day, October 5th. Additionally, all students arriving to school on October 5th were required to walk through a metal detector and to have their bags scanned by a computerized program. Police presence remained active throughout the school day on October 5th and many extra safety measures were taken. By the afternoon of October 5th, the Methuen Police Chief as well as the Head of School had announced that there was no longer any imminent threat and that school would proceed as normal the following day. In the late evening hours of October 5th, police reported that a student had confessed to writing the threatening messages on the school wall. Police also confirmed the following day, October 6th, that a juvenile felony charge would be filed against the student in question, who has not yet been identified by authorities. =Impending 2020 Closure= In October 2019, Presentation of Mary Academy announced that the school would close at the end of the 2020 school year. Financial concerns were the primary cause for this decision - enrollment at the school has significantly declined over the past several years and the number of students attending while unable to afford full tuition was increasing. As a private school that does not receive any state or federal tax dollars, all revenue is financed through donations, fundraisers, tuition, and the Sisters of the Presentation. In September, it had announced that the Sisters would leave the property, further adding to the financial stress of the school.

The word pasola means spear in the local language and derives from the Sanskrit sula. According to legend, pasola originated with a woman from the village of Waiwuang. When her husband – a local leader – left home for an extended period, she believed him to be dead and eloped with a new lover from another village. After her husband returned, the woman still chose to stay with her new lover, and the two were married. To forget their leader's sadness, the people of Waiwuang held the festival of pasola. Originally the participants rode horses and threw spears at each other in an attempt to spill blood to the ground,Spirit of Asia – Michael Macintyre – British Broadcasting Corporation, Jan 1, 1980 p. 23 as a way of thanking the ancestors for a successful harvest and ensuring another prosperous rice harvest. The ritual changed over time into more of a mock battle. The spear tips are now blunt and their metal tips removed. Whereas it was once considered an honour to die during pasola, only accidental deaths occasionally occur today. The human and horse blood which used to drench the field is now solely from sacrificed pigs, dogs, and chickens. Armed police are kept on guard to prevent fights from breaking out. Beginning in the 2010s, pasola has been promoted as a \\"game\\" for visiting spectators. The event traditionally begins when a certain kind of sea worm swims to shore, signifying the end of the wet season and the beginning of crop-planting. Today, the elders decide on the date in advance for the sake of tourists. Pasola is always held for four weeks in February and March.

Tung started off as a jockey with his family racing horse stable. He was then recruited to become a horse racing commentator. Due to his fame, he was invited to act in many movies beginning in the late 1970s. He appeared in several films with Jackie Chan during the 1980s and 1990s, such as playing Inspector \\"Uncle\\" Bill Wong in the original Police Story series, including his final movie role in Police Story 4: First Strike in 1996. Tung retired from horse racing commentating in 2000. Tung died in 2006 of lung failure.http://ent.sina.com.cn/f/s/dongbiaoqushi/index.shtml Biography Tung was born in Hong Kong in 1933. He started to learn horse riding when he was eight years old. He became an official horse jockey when he was twelve after graduating from the first post war Hong Kong Jockey Club training. In his short horse jockey career, he went to Singapore, United Kingdom and other countries as a professional horse jockey. After learning to be a horse trainer, Tung served in his family's stables as vice-horse trainers. In 1967, when Rediffusion Television (now Asia Television) began broadcasting horse racing, Tung was recruited to become a horse racing commentator. Due to his frank assessment and criticism in the horse racing circles, he was respectfully called \\"Uncle Biu\\". Due to the loss of broadcasting rights, Tung was not able to continue as a commentator on television and he joined the Hong Kong Jockey Club as a radio show host. It had an effect on the radio industry as the listenership for Radio Television Hong Kong increased significantly. After 1997, when Asia Television lost the horse racing broadcasting rights, Tung went to the Macau Jockey Club as a horse trainer. In his first year as a trainer, Tung won 64 races with the horses from his stables. He also worked as a horse racing commentator in Macau until 2000. He returned to Hong Kong as a horse racing commentator for the 2003-04 horse racing season. In July 2005, Tung retired from the media industry due to heart disease. He had been hospitalized several times due to diabetes and heart diseases. On February 16, 2006, Tung was admitted to St. Paul's Hospital on Hong Kong Island due to physical discomfort. On February 22, 11pm, due to pulmonary fibrosis leading to organ failure, Tung died in the hospital in the company of loved ones, at the age of 73. A funeral committee was set up and Tung's wake was held on March 13, 2006, 4 pm at the Hong Kong Coliseum. Actor and good friend Jackie Chan was one of the pall-bearers. In the afternoon of the next day, Tung was cremated at Sha Tin's crematorium. In his four marriages, Tung had five children. His three daughters are now married. Both of his sons have died, one at a young age, and his second of cancer.

They are closely related to the Lunda and Ndembu to the northeast, but they also share cultural similarities to the Kaonde to the east, and to the Chokwe and Luchazi, important groups of eastern Angola.  Language  The Luvale language belongs the longer Niger-Congo language phylum, and is considered a west central Bantu language. It is recognized as a regional language for educational and administrative purposes in Zambia, where 168,00 people speak it (2006).  History  Prior to settling in the Congo, the Luvale originally came from north of Lake Tanganyika in an area located between the Eastern Rift mountains and Lake Victoria. Oral tradition holds that the first leader among these migrants was Kenga Naweji. During the migration south, she became too old to move, and set up her first camp at Lake Tanganyika. The trek then continued on until they reached the present day Democratic Republic of Congo. This is where the Luvale dynasty originated from Konde Mateti, who had 6 children. The first was Chinguli, believed to be the founder of the tribes in the north of Namibia and south of Angola. The second was Chinyama cha Mukwamayi, the founder of the Luvale chieftainship. Then came Kalumbu, a girl who was followed by a boy called Ndonji, commonly associated with Chokwe. The fifth was another boy called Lukombo who died at an early age. Last to be born was Lueji, a girl- future queen of the Lunda. She would go on to fall in love with the adventurer hunter Tshibinda Ilunga, a Luba prince. This enraged her brothers Chinguli and Chinyama so much that they split from the Lunda. Chinguli was the first to leave and headed southwest, establishing his own chieftainship. He was later followed by his brothers, Chinyama cha Mukwamayi and Ndonji, and his sister, Kalumbu, who went on to found their tribes. Chinyama, still in pursuit of more land, established the Kakenge chieftainship around 1747 near the Lumbala stream in Angola. = Atlantic Slave Trade = The Luvale were the first in the Upper Zambezi to receive Ovimbundu traders from Angola in the 18th century. The Ovimbundu were seeking slaves for the Portuguese and had had been spurned by their Lozi partners. Generally, they were not interested in taking the slaves themselves, but preferred buy them for guns, cloth, jewelry, and other goods. Through their participation, the Luvale became a force to reckon with, and raided nearby tribes to procure slaves for the Ovimbundu. By the mid 19th century, guns were widespread in both Luvale society and culture, and travellers' accounts noted that practically all the major chiefs were also important slave traders. Chiefs Nyakatolo and Kangombe Kayambi were two particular Luvale that became notorious for their involvement in the slave trade. The Luvale also augmented their wealth by exacting payments from caravans, in exchange for passing through their areas uninterrupted. The Luvale would continually expand their domain in search of new raiding targets, coming to clash with the Southern Lunda chieftainships in particular. The slave trade would reach its peak and the 1830s and 1840s, before slowly dying out by the turn of the century. Starting in the 1890s, Luvale slaving parties carried out a series of attacks against the Lunda, which came to be known as \\"the Wars of Ulamba.\\" In an unprecedented move, the Lunda chief Ishinde appealed to the Barotse's leader, Lewanika, for aid against the Luvale. Lewanika, seeking to consolidate his grip over the region, sent a military contingent against the Luvale. The Luvale's slave raiding activities were only completely stopped by British conquest in the early 20th century. In 1907, the slaves in the part of the Upper Zambezi under British administration were officially freed, but a system of debt slavery continued on a limited scale for the decades. = European Rule = Barotseland and its neighbors were brought under formal British influence with the signing of the Lochner Concession in 1890 between Lewanika and the British South Africa Company (BSAC). Lewanika had made the claim that the Upper Zambezi was under his domain, a valid statement in the eyes of the Barotse, as it was supported by their intervention in the Wars of Ulamba. BSAC, which was anxious to counter Portuguese claims, accepted the claim. Because it was advantageous to the interests of the Barotse and the BSAC, Balovale was henceforth considered to be a part of Barotseland. The Lunda, and especially the Luvale, were vehemently opposed to Barotse influence, and complained vigorously to a succession of District Commissioners that the historical justification used for Barotse rule was mistaken. Nevertheless, colonial administrators continued to support Barotse rule, and this would be reflected in the administration of the Barotse Province. Each 'recognized' Lunda and Luvale chief was nominally placed under of a Barotse induna; the language of local administration was Lozi, and all major decisions were referred to the Barotse Province headquarters in Mongu. In 1941, Balovale was formally made independent from the rest of Barotseland. Years prior, Sir Hubert Young, the governor of Northern Rhodesia at the time, had signed a 1936 agreement with the Litunga and the Kuta, setting up Native Courts in Barotseland, including Balovale in it. The Luvale and Lunda opposed this, and refused to accept the jurisidiction of the Barotse courts. The two tribes argued that they should have been consulted for this agreement, and another meeting was held in Livingstone in 1937, attended by the Barotse, Lunda, and Luvale leaders. However, the opposing sides were unable to come to consensus, and it was decided that a commission should look at the claims of both sides. King George VI selected Philip MacDonell as the president of the commission for his prior experience as a judge in Northern Rhodesia and elsewhere. He visited the areas in question and interviewed witnesses, but upon MacDonell's return to England, the government became preoccupied with WWII, and a final decision took some years to be made. On July 9 1941, the Northern Rhodesia Government Gazette announced the change, stating that the King's Commissioner found that the land in the Balovale district did not belong to the Barotse. In accordance with this finding, it was decided that the Lunda and Luvale were entitled to be free from Barotse influence, and will have their own Native Courts, Native Authorities, and Native Treasuries. = Post Independence = Luvale and Lunda tribal strife reached such an intensity that States of Emergency had to be declared in the Zambezi District in the 1940s and 1950s. In August 27, conflict between the Luvale and Lunda once again erupted in northwestern Zambia, leaving hundreds homeless. Zambian President Chiluda had appointed only Lunda to top positions in local government in the region, widening ethnic divisions.  Society & Culture  = Society = The Luvale observe matrilineal descent and prefer cross cousin marriage. Commoner lineage groups play a bigger role than in other northwestern Zambian peoples, and are rather independent of the chiefs. Traditionally, the Luvale do not recognize a paramount leader, but instead pledge allegiance to local chiefs who inherit their positions matrilineally from the maternal uncle. Chiefs ('Mwana nganga') consult with a committee of elders and ritual specialists before making decisions. Villages are divided into manageable sections, which are governed by family headmen. All members of Luvale society are divided into two categories, those descended from the founding matrilineal lines and descended from former enslaved populations. With the advent of colonialism however, a senior chief became custom, referred to as Chief Ndungu. Of the thirteen clans (‘miyachi‘) that make up the Luvale tribe, only the ‘NamaKungu’ has members who can ascend to the throne. Only children of a female chief (‘vamyangana’) can rule. A child of a male chief is called Mwana Uta or 'child of the bow', and can never become a chief. All clans have totems or identifiers (mostly animals) such as hawks, owls, and fish. According to C.M.N. White, a British civil servant who spent many years in the area, each clan has a legendary explanation of how it arose, and a clan recitation ('kulisasula jikumbu') of which identifies a clan member. In July 28 2020, the Luvale royal establishment selected Chinyama Ngundu as the new senior chief, as his predecessor (and uncle) passed away January of that year. However, his ascension remains disputed by other Luvale chiefs. = Art = The Luvale are noted for their masks, many of which are danced during initiation ceremonies to educate the initiates and to mark the territory where the ceremonies take place. They are skilled craftsmen known for making baskets, weaving mats (‘visalo’) pottery, metalwork (‘lutengo’) and stools. Some stools are made exclusively from wood, while some may feature a hide seat on a wooden frame called ‘likupu‘. The most commonly made basket is the ‘mbango’, a medium-sized basket for storing grain or maize meal. They also make musical instruments such as the ‘jinjimba’ (a xylophone), the ‘likembe’ (a small hand piano), and a variety of drums. = Religion = The Luvale recognize Kalunga, a sky god of creation and supreme power; it's held that it has power over every other deity and is omniscient and all seeing. Additionally, Kalunga holds jurisdiction over the spirits of both the living and the dead, blessing the good and punishing the wicked. The Luvale also recognize the mahamba, nature and ancestral spirits. These spirits may belong to the individual, the family, or the community, and must be appeased through offerings in order to maintain good fortune. Evil spirits may also be activated by sorcerers ('orwanga') to cause illness, and must be counteracted to regain health. To accomplish this, individuals will consult with a diviner ('nganga'), who will attempt to uncover the source of the patient's problem. The most common form of divination among Luvale involves basket divination, which consists of the tossing of up to sixty individual objects in a basket. The configuration of the objects is then \\"read\\" by the diviner to determine the cause of illness. = Festivals =  Likumbi Lya Mize  The official traditional ceremony is Likumbi Lya Mize, and is one of the most popular traditional festivals in Zambia. Taking place during the last weekend of August, it includes two initiation ceremonies for girls and boys. ‘The name translates to ‘ceremony of the Mize’ which is the name of the headquarters of the Luvale and is located in the town of Zambezi in North Western Province. The ceremony generally lasts a week and includes activities such as dancing by masked male dancers ('makishi') and by girls who have undergone the wali initiation ceremony, speeches by the chief and government officials, and drumming.  Wali  The wali ceremony occurs when a girl begins her first menstruation cycle. She is taken into seclusion and brought to a fig tree ('muulya'), a symbol of fertility, where she remains until a grass hut (‘litungu’) is built for her. She is given protective medicine by an older woman who acts as a teacher and guide during the process (chilombola’). The initiate (who is referred to as ‘mwali’) is also assigned a younger girl (‘kajilu’ or ‘kasambibiijikilo’) who helps with chores. Like the female initiates, the males (‘tundanji‘) have teachers who guide them through the process. These are called ‘makishi (‘likishi‘ is the singular). During the period of seclusion (which could last between four to six months), girls are prepared for marriage through being taught about hygiene, sex, and domestic chores. On the first day of their seclusion, the girl will make a girdle ('zeva') which she will wear for the duration of the ceremony. They are not allowed to run too fast, lie on her stomach, eat certain foods, be seen with members of the opposite sex, or speak unless necessary. She must also refrain from contact with fire, which is associated with life, and its absence, coldness, is symbolic of death; only her grandmother kindles the fire for her. When a girl returns to her village, she has to be covered in a traditional cotton cloth ('chitenge'). In recent times, seclusion lasts instead only a week to a month. To graduate, she must perform various dances symbolizing the skills she has acquired. She is then covered in oil and red ochre. Afterwards, she is presented to her new husband. Due to a modernized legal system the initiation ceremony now happens later in a woman’s life (before marriage) although it still happens at puberty for Luvale girls from rural areas. Child marriages are now illegal in Zambia, so even if a girl reaches puberty at 13 in a rural area, she may do the wali but not get married straight away. Previously, arranged marriages would take place, but in modern times, couples marry for love.  Mukanda  Luvale males between the ages of 8 and 12 will participate in the 'mukanda', sometimes called the kumukanda, a coming age ceremony. It typically takes place at the beginning of the dry season. There are three distinct stages, the first being the preparation, which begins when a village headman ('chilolo') or important elder, having reached consensus with the families of young uncircumcised boys, publicly announces that the time for the mukanda has come. The candidates are then gathered together at the mukanda, where they are circumcised; at this stage, the initiator of the mukanda ceremony becomes known as the 'chijika mukanda', or the 'planter of mukanda.' They will then invoke the spirits before the muyombo tree to bless and purify the children who will undergo the operation. The Luvale consider uncircumcised men dirty or unhygienic. The second stage is the seclusion, where young boys will leave their homes and live for one to three months in an isolated bush camp. This separation from the outside world marks their symbolic death as children. It is said that in some very rural areas where the mukanda is strictly maintained that if a woman is to pass by the boy's 'bush camp' whilst they are undergoing mukanda then she must be punished, even killed. The initiates ('vatunduji' or 'tundanji') will undergo tests of courage and learn lessons on their future role as men and husbands. They will be taught skills such as making masks, or makishi', wood-carving, basketry, smithing, and other practical skills. They are also allowed to play games and sports. The curriculum also includes cultural instruction in the ancient form of design and calculus known as 'tusona', a tradition of ideographic tracings that are made in sand. Like the female initiates, the boys have teachers who guide them through the process. These are also referred to as ‘makishi' (‘likishi‘ is the singular, meaning mask); each likishi has a distinct role. The makishi wear elaborate masks and dyed woven costumes made from barkcloth. The masks are made of wood and embellished with plant fiber, cordage, beads and other materials to convey the age, gender, social rank and power of the archetypes they embody. Signs and symbols on the masks are meant to indicate the forces of the universe. They represent the spirit of a deceased ancestor who returns to the world of the living to assist the boys in their transition from childhood to adulthood. During the ceremony, they will symbolically arise and assemble from the graveyard ('kuvumbuka). Each boy is assigned a specific likishi, who remains with him throughout the entire process. There are a variety of roles the makishi can take. Although all makishi are men (their identity is never revealed and it said that they dress in graveyards to shield themselves from the public), there are some female representations of women. The following list details many, though not all, of the possible makishi roles. * The 'Chisaluke' represents a powerful and wealthy man with spiritual influence. * The 'Mupala', or 'Kayipu', is the “lord” or king of the mukanda and a protective spirit with supernatural abilities. It's always accompanied by ‘kapalu‘– the bodyguard, or son. He is the biggest and most majestic of all the makishi, with his huge round impressive headdress, which is associated with the chief. * The 'Pwebo', or 'Mwanapwebo', is a female character representing the ideal woman and is responsible for the musical accompaniment of the rituals and dances. Pwebo means 'woman' in the Luvale language. * The 'Chileya' represents a fool with a childish characteristic, mimicking others, dresses in an undignified fashion, and dances like a learner and not an expert. * The 'Chiwigi' is meant to represent a stylish and vain young woman, and wears a wig of braided hair. * The 'Chikungila' is an ambiguous ancestral spirit painted half red and half white; it is said to possess great spiritual power. The white and red halves of its mask are said to show a balance between the positive and the ominous, respectively. * The 'Utenu' is known as \\"the angry one\\"; always in a bad mood, always uttering insults. * The 'Katoyo', or 'Chindele' originally mocked foreigners and outsiders; oftentimes, the colonial powers. * The Katotola also possesses supernatural powers, the one who finds what is hidden. The completion of the mukanda is celebrated with a graduation ceremony, the makishi masquerade. The boys are welcomed back into their community as adult men; the entire village is free to attend the makishi masquerade and pantomime- like performance. After the ritual, the makishi masks are burned or buried, symbolically returning them to the world of the dead. In recent times, masks have incorporated notions of the new; newer representations of makishi might include the face of a boom box, a VCR player, radio, or etc. The mukanda has an educational function of transmitting practical survival-skills as well as knowledge about nature, sexuality, religious beliefs and the social values of the community. In former times, it took place over a period of several months and represented the entire reason behind the makishi masquerade. The practice is not unique to the Luvale, and is also performed by many other groups. Today, it is often reduced to one month in order to adapt to the school calendar. This adjustment together with the increasing demand for makishi dancers at social gatherings and party rallies, might affect the ritual’s original character. = Marriage = As is custom, when a couple is ready to be married, the groom is required to pay a bride price to the woman’s family. In Luvale, the bride price is called ‘matemo’ or ‘vikumba’ ( meaning ‘things’). It is offered to the bride's ('mwenga') relatives as a sign of respect and appreciation. A groom may welcome a bride with a small celebration (‘vitilekela‘). At this timfe, people of his village will greet the bride, encouraging her to be a good person and feed the village’s children and strangers. Some days later, the bride goes through a ritual introducing her to her own hearth. This ‘lighting the fire’ ritual characterizes all female transitions and is also performed for girls who have reached puberty and for new mothers. Sometime later the groom gives gifts (‘vifupa wenga‘) to the bride’s relatives which enable him to eat within their village or villages. This is followed by a return gift to the bride’s matrilineal relatives which thereafter enables them to eat at the groom’s village. Traditionally, the groom was expected to provide everything in the marriage (a house, food, clothes), so the wife leaves her home without her personal items including clothing. However, in modern times due to economic reasons, intercultural marriages and urbanization, the wife usually brings her own kitchen items which are purchased for her as part of a pre-wedding ceremony called a kitchen party. = Food = The Luvale have a largely agrarian economy, and their staple crops are manioc, cassava, yams, and peanuts. Tobacco and hemp is grown for snuff, and maize is grown for beer. The farming and processing of agricultural products is done almost exclusively by the women of Luvale. Slash and burn techniques and crop rotation are practiced to naturally conserve the land. Pigs, chickens, sheep and goats are kept for domestic use. There is an exclusive society of hunters called ‘yanga,‘ who are responsible for catching bigger game, but eveyone contributes to the capture of small game animals. However game has become scarce in much of their region. They are known for being renowned fishermen and export dried catfish to the mining centers of the Copperbelt. = Naming = Like many other African tribes, a child's name is usually influenced by the circumstances surrounding its birth. Children may be named according to the time and place of birth, events or circumstances of birth, birth order, or after kinsmen. Immediately following the birth of a child, the midwife, also known as Chifungiji, bestows a temporary name upon the newborn. When the child's umbilical cord drops off, the parents, usually the father, will bestow a name upon the newborn. The mother is allowed to name the second child; grandparents and uncles may also name subsequent children. Once a child is named by its parents, this name will be permanently used in interactions. It is common that parents will greet the baby in words and songs, using a variety of names; the one that makes the baby smile or soothed is assumed to be the 'right' one. If the child continuously and habitually cries, this indicates the name is inadequate. The name must then be changed to another. This stems from the Luvale belief in reincarnation. Sometimes the name is changed if the child become seriously sick. In that case, a traditional healer ('chimbanda') will treat the child and select a new name, for it is believed the previous name is now associated with misfortune. Examples of names given to describe circumstances include ‘Kahilu’ meaning ‘he who has returned/come back’. The female version is ‘Omba’. Christianity has also had an impact on the naming culture with names being localized, for instance, ‘Daniel’ becomes ‘Ndanyele’. = Lunda = The conflict between the Luvale and Lunda dates back to the Wars of Ulamba, when Luvale frequently raided Lunda settlements for slaves. The Luvale and Lunda have often come into conflict with one another since the 1940s; strife has further intensified over prime agricultural lands, given the region's poor soils. Both groups, in turn oppose their powerful Barotse neighbors to the south.  Demographics  = Zambia = In Zambia, they are found mainly in the North-Western Province of Zambia, centered in the town of Zambezi, previously known as Balovale. They make up approximately 20.4% of the population of the province. Some Zambian Luvale have left their ancestral lands, often for economic reasons, and can be found in other locations in Zambia such as the Lukanga Swamp. There is also considerable rural-to-urban migration to Lusaka. = Angola = In Angola they reside in the east of the Moxico Province. = South Africa = Some Luvale have migrated to South Africa and are often stigmatized as rustics; consequently, they've been frequently limited to the most menial of jobs.  In Popular Culture  * In the Swedish 1997 murder mystery novel \\"Faceless Killers\\", Inspector Kurt Wallander investigates a murderous racist attack on a refugee center in Skane and finds it difficult to communicate with a witness who speaks only the Luvale language. The problem is resolved when a 90-year-old former woman missionary is found, who speaks Luvale fluently and acts as the interpreter.

After attending a public, co-educational primary school, she went on to enroll at all-girls private preparatory academy. She stated that single-sex schooling \\"made me not a feminist. It was normal that women do whatever anybody did. Women were the sports experts. Women were the brains. You weren't in competition with men. You weren't expected to shut up—on the contrary! Even in my era, I never felt that I was particularly put down as a woman ever.\\" George's father encouraged all her interests, including those outside the realm of traditional femininity, such as science and baseball, and when he went to serve in World War II, George assisted in planting a victory garden. = Academic Career = As a young student, George was an outstanding student who developed a strong interest in the French language and French culture. As a teenager she chose to attend Smith College, with the desire to study abroad in France. While studying abroad, she took courses at Sciences Po. She attained her bachelor's degree from Smith College in French and philosophy. George later attended the Sorbonne, attaining a license, a three-year degree, in philosophy. George also attained her doctorate in political science from the University of Paris. = Personal Life = During her time abroad in France, she met French lawyer, Charles-Henry George, 12 years her senior, and later moved to France to marry him in 1956. Quoted about her early years in France she said she felt homesick \\"for my women friends, probably, but not for America, per se. I'd made my choice.\\"interview in Current Biography The couple soon started a family. Susan George obtained her French citizenship in 1994. In 2002 Charles-Henry George died. As of 2013, George had three children and four grandchildren, which she says has further inspired her activism, saying in an interview \\"Either we achieve together a new level of human emancipation, and do so in a way that preserves the earth, or we shall leave behind us the worst future for our children that capitalism and nature can deal them. No one knows in which direction the balance will tip nor does anyone know which actions, which writings, which alliances may achieve the critical mass that leads us one way or another, backwards or forwards. I am acutely conscious of the precariousness of our moment and my four much-loved grandchildren give me added resolve to address it.\\" Career Throughout her career, Susan George has been an antiwar activist as well as criticising what she saw as acts of corporate greed. At a time when women were not often allowed places of power in any organizational hierarchy, George established herself as a leader in the anti-hunger movement. = Early Antiwar Activism = She became a political activist in response to France's war in Algeria and U.S. involvement in Vietnam. George said that the Vietnam War \\"was this sort of gateway to understanding what America could be, which is to say something quite negative, which I had not understood at all when I lived there. I had accepted the usual propaganda.\\" In 1967 she joined the Paris-American Committee to Stop War (P.A.C.S.), and became assistant to the director of an NGO, the American Centre for Students and Artists, in 1969. This sparked the interest of the CIA who had already been looking into P.A.C.S.mentioning of P.A.C.S. on page 13-14 a memorandum on the American Centre for Students and Artists mentioning George In 1971 she began working with the Front Solidarite Indochine, a group that organized antiwar lectures and protests in France. Shortly after, P.A.C.S. was dismantled by the French government. She then collaborated with the directors of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C., to form a new NGO devoted to social justice, which, in 1973, became the Transnational Institute . = Anti-Hunger Activism = In 1974 she attended the World Food Conference in Rome, but was disillusioned due to her feeling that agribusiness representatives dominated the proceedings, saying in an interview that \\"no one who counted took the real reasons for hunger—power and control in the wrong hands—into account.\\" In 1976 her first book was published: How the Other Half Dies: The Real Reasons for World Hunger.William Diebold book review In 1984 she helped in organizing the World Food Assembly, a meeting held in Rome, Italy. = Organizational Involvement = From 1990 to 1995 she served on the board of conservation group Greenpeace International, as well as that of Greenpeace France. George opposed the OECD's proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) in the 1990s, and the ill-fated \\"Millennium Round\\" objectives of the World Trade Organization at Seattle in 1999. From 1999 to 2006 she was vice-president of ATTAC France (Association for Taxation of (financial) Transactions to Aid Citizens) and remains a member of the scientific council. She was awarded the title of honorary president in 2008.announcement of the honorary position on the ATTAC website (french) In 1999 she also participated in the Helsinki Process.list of members of the Helsinki Process Susan George was involved with the World Social Forum since its inception in 2000, and the spin-off European Social Forum. Though she was critical of the forums' initial structure, and believed that more action outside of forums was needed to bring about change, she applauded the steps they made towards changing \\"the political landscape\\". In 2004 she supported John Kerry for president. She canvassed for Kerry in Pennsylvania, but wrote for in a piece for OpenDemocracy \\"we all thought [Kerry] had a very good chance, even though everyone admitted it was hard to get really enthusiastic about him.... The man isn't the most charismatic ever to walk the earth. But at least he's not a proto-fascist or a go-it-aloner, and that's what we seem—apart from a last-minute miracle—to be stuck with now. With four years clear ahead of him and no re-election to worry about, I fear Bush and the ghastly neo- con/neo-liberals around him will now go on the rampage. They can continue with impunity their attacks on the Constitution and on hard-won freedoms...\\". Throughout the latter half of the 2000's, George continued making appearances, such as partaking in the 2006 Table of Free Voices conference, and appearing in the 2008 documentary film, The End of Poverty?.

At the centre of a purpose-built hall was a giant globe, in diameter. The globe was hollow and contained a staircase and elevated platforms which members of the public could climb in order to view the surface of the earth on its concave interior, modelled in plaster of Paris, complete with mountain ranges and rivers all to scale. Punch described the attraction as \\"a geographical globule which the mind can take in at one swallow.\\" In the surrounding galleries were displays of Wyld's maps, globes and surveying equipment. Wyld originally proposed that the globe should be constructed at the Great Exhibition, but its size and Wyld's desire to run it as a promotional venture precluded it from being featured inside the Crystal Palace, so Wyld negotiated with the owners of the gardens of Leicester Square, and after much wrangling secured an agreement to site it there for ten years. The exhibition hall and model of the Earth were hastily constructed to coincide with the Great Exhibition. In its first year the Great Globe was a resounding success, with visitor numbers second only to those of the Great Exhibition, but from 1852 onward public interest in the attraction slowly waned. Though the novelty of a concave globe continued to win accolades for Wyld, he was faced with competition from other educational attractions, and had to adapt the entertainments on offer in order to maintain visitor numbers. Wyld held topical exhibitions and gave lectures on current events, and attempted to transfer ownership of the attraction to the \\"Cosmos Institute\\" to establish a national geographic and ethnological museum. In 1862, when Wyld's agreement for the use of the land expired, the exhibition hall was removed and the globe broken up and sold for scrap. The complicated ownership of Leicester Square gardens, combined with Wyld's failure to honour his agreement to restore the gardens after the removal of the exhibition building, led to extensive legal wrangling and questions in Parliament. Wyld finally sold his interests in the gardens, and in 1874 they were donated to the City of London. Although there were other proposals for giant globes, and a few were constructed, it was not until 1935 that a large concave globe was recreated in the form of Chester Lindsay Churchill's Mapparium at the Mary Baker Eddy Library in Boston, Massachusetts. James Wyld James Wyld (the Younger) (1812–1887) James Wyld was a noted geographer and map-seller. He was the eldest son of James Wyld the Elder (1790–1836) and Eliza (née Legg). In 1838, he married Anne, the daughter of John Hester, and had two children, one of whom, James John Cooper Wyld also became a map publisher. On his father's death in 1836, Wyld became the sole owner of the thriving family mapmaking business based in Charing Cross. His maps, which covered regions as diverse as London and the gold fields of California, were regarded highly, and Wyld himself had an excellent reputation as a mapmaker; he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1839, and he was appointed Geographer to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert (as had been his father before him). He had an opportunistic approach to the business and was a prolific publisher of maps and guides (so much so that Punch claimed that if a country were discovered in the interior of the earth Wyld would produce a map of it \\"as soon as it is discovered, if not before\\" ), but his projects were not always successful; although he profited from the \\"Railway Mania\\" of the later 1830s, he became entangled in a number of court cases with unsuccessful railway companies as a result, and he overreached himself by printing maps and guides of the London rail network which included stations and connections that were planned but subsequently not built. He helped start both the Association of Surveyors and the Surveyors' Institution to lobby against the Ordnance Survey, as he felt its activities threatened his business, but when these associations failed, he pragmatically got his company appointed as one of the six official outlets for the new OS maps. He had an account at the Royal British Bank, which collapsed in 1856, wiping out the savings of many of the depositors, but the extent of his losses is not recorded.Wyld was the chairman of the depositors committee which managed to negotiate a favourable return of 15 shillings in the pound from the shareholders He was also the Liberal MP for Bodmin, though his political career was on hiatus for much of the time that he managed the Great Globe. On his first election in 1848 there were charges of bribery at the polling stations, although it was decided that these accusations could not be substantiated, and he was allowed to take up his seat. His idea for the Great Globe had been many years in the formulation: a correspondent of Notes and Queries mentioned that as early as 1839, Wyld had broached the subject of a concave globe at a meeting to discuss an earlier giant globe project.This plan by William Vialls for a georama in London never progressed past the planning stage. Site Wyld had approached the organizing committee of the Great Exhibition with a plan to erect a giant globe within the exhibition hall. Although he presented it as an educational attraction, Wyld's ulterior motive was to use the globe to promote his map-making business. The size of the proposed exhibit and the organizers' decision that no commercial enterprises should use the exhibition as a platform to sell their goods or services led to the rejection of Wyld's plan. Undaunted, Wyld began to search for an alternate location for his project; the reason later given for not building within the Crystal Palace was purely the lack of space rather than any rejection by the organizing committee of the commercial aspect of the project. An article in The Builder on 30 November 1850 mentioned that negotiations were already underway to secure the gardens of Leicester Square. Described in Charles Dickens' Household Words as a \\"howling desert\\", the gardens were at that time an insalubrious area, \\"with broken railings, a receptacle for dead cats and every kind of abomination\\"Yates p.34 and a meeting place for \\"ne'er well-to-do youths\\".Black p.29 Leicester Square had been Prince Albert's initial choice as a site for the Great Exhibition building, but the site was quickly dismissed as too small.Altick p.230Gibbs-Smith p.6 Wyld made an agreement with the owner of the gardens, Pheobe Moxhay, to acquire the freehold for £3,000, but the Tulk family, who owned the buildings on three sides of the square and already had a judgement against Moxhay's late husband, would have been able to prevent Wyld building. They used this hold over him to negotiate a favourable deal for themselves: they would allow Wyld to use the land for ten years from 25 April 1851, after which he would remove any buildings that he had erected within six months, and each branch of the Tulk family would have a one-year option to buy half the land for £500.The Tulk family had bought part of the Leicester Square estate around 1758 and by an agreement in 1807 John Augustus Tulk had divided the estate with his eldest son Charles Augustus Tulk. Although Wyld and the Tulks attempted to negotiate with the owner of the buildings on the north side of the square, Henry Webb, they were not able to reach an agreement, and they eventually signed the contract without his assent. When Wyld began to prepare the site, Webb announced his intention to take out an injunction to prevent the building work proceeding. Wyld restarted negotiations with Webb and eventually (in July 1851, over a month after the building had been completed) Webb agreed to allow the ten-year agreement with the Tulks to stand. Wyld obviously still felt insecure about his claim on the land and, although he was not an MP himself between 1852 and 1857, over the years a number of bills surfaced in Parliament aimed at either establishing the title to the gardens in his favour or confirming the validity of the erection of the globe building. It appears that Wyld initially intended to seek public funding for the construction but after an estimate of the costs he considered it was unlikely that he would be able to secure reimbursement and decided instead on a purely commercial venture.Wyld p.xi Construction The plan for the Great Globe as published in The Builder on 5 April 1851. The exterior galleries shown in the plan were not finished until after the attraction opened. =Planning= Through an advertisement in The Builder, Wyld contracted Edward Welch as the architect for the project. Welch submitted his first set of plans in January 1851. These plans included the construction of four theatres which Wyld planned to rent out to recoup his expenses, but there was vigorous opposition from the residents of the square, and when Wyld put the plans out to tender, the cheapest quote – from George Myers – was £2,561. Welch negotiated this down to £1,888, but Wyld informed Welch that he considered the price prohibitive. As he was embroiled in negotiations with Henry Webb at the same time, Wyld decided that he would have to settle for something less ambitious and to \\"give up a great part of the original design of the building\\". He showed Welch's initial designs to the architect H.R. Abraham who considered that they were impractical. Wyld was worried about Welch's ability to meet his deadlines and asked him to pass any plans to Abraham for approval. On 4 February, Wyld met with the residents of Leicester Square to present his plans for the gardens. At this meeting he claimed that in addition to the £3,000 he had paid for the freehold he had also agreed to pay £4,500 for the building and the works would cost £12,000; he would have to spend around £21,800 on the project in total, which included the outlay for new gardens and a new enclosure railing. After much discussion and receiving various assurances from Wyld that he would restore the gardens when the building was removed, the residents' committee approved his plan. On 24 February, Wyld asked Welch to retire from the project, promising that he would be paid for the work he had done so far. Wyld then contracted Abraham to produce new plans. Abraham's designs included a new supporting wall for the globe itself (correcting what he saw as Welch's error of leaving the trusses unsupported), as well as buildings to cover the whole area of the gardens which Wyld would be able to rent out to recoup some of his costs. Despite what he had told the residents' committee, Wyld had set a budget of £2,000 for the entire building work and so could not afford the outlying buildings. Abraham's designs – minus the additional buildings, but with a circular Moorish corridor designed by G.A. JermynSometimes seen as G.R. Jermyn – got the final go-ahead on 15 March 1851, even though the new bids for the contract were substantially higher than they had been for Welch's original plans. George Myers' firm was again the cheapest at £2,755 and he was contracted to continue with the work. Both Welch and Abraham were eventually forced to sue to get their fees. =Building work= Though the design of the building was not finalized until mid-March, building work had commenced immediately upon the conclusion of the agreement with the Tulks (Wyld did not actually complete the purchase of the land from Moxhay until April). Before the globe could be erected it was necessary to remove the equestrian statue of George I by C. Burchard that had been erected in the centre of the gardens by Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1747 (perhaps to annoy his father George II, who had in turn been on poor terms with his father).Richardson p.199 Details of the statue's treatment are unclear; for the most part it was reported that it was lowered into a specially constructed pit that was located beneath the building when it was erected, but there were also stories that it was sawn up and buried or that Irish workers had dismantled it and taken pieces for themselves. A question was raised in Parliament as to the fate of the statue (mistakenly identified as George II) and, when questioned, Wyld – who by his own admission spent little time on site because he was \\"absorbed with [his] model\\" – replied that when it was examined it was found to be only lead packed with clay and thrown away with \\"other rubbish\\". In 1862 when the globe building was demolished, the horse's body was found lying on its side, and the head was reported to have been found wrapped in sacking. Work progressed quickly. Wyld directed the project, but day-to-day site management was mostly left to Myers and Horatio Miller, an acquaintance of Wyld's who had taken an interest in the project. Miller was also later involved in a court case against Wyld, claiming that he had not been paid fairly for his work; the court found in Wyld's favour. Under the management of Myers, 300 builders raced to complete the building. The production of the casts which would form the internal surface of the globe was already well-advanced as Wyld had been working on them in a workshop in St Pancras since at least late October 1850. The project was not without its problems however. Although he had been contemplating the idea for many years, Wyld quickly realised once work was underway that the project called not just for money but for inventiveness; there were setbacks in the design and manufacture of the globe that \\"demanded an amount of labour and a degree of application, anxiety, and responsibility, of the extent of which no adequate estimate could be formed\\".Wyld p.xii The Great Globe was not the first project of its kind: a small hollow globe was completed in 1664 for Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and the Georama built by C. F. P. DelanglardSometimes seen as just Langlard in Paris in the 1820s had been on similar lines to Wyld's project – a large globe with the earth represented on the interior surface and a pair of spiral staircases from which visitors could view the attraction. The Georama had been smaller and of a simpler construction though, using material and paper draped over an iron frame, and the methods employed there would not have been applicable to Wyld's larger, more robust version.Altick p.464 The construction difficulties and minor accidents (a shed used by the labourers burned down on 18 May though nobody was injured) delayed the project slightly, but construction continued day and night and as the building rapidly took shape it attracted almost as much attention as the raising of the Crystal Palace. On 29 May, Wyld held a preview for the press and invited guests, and on 2 June 1851, one month after the Great Exhibition started, the Great Globe was ready to open its doors to the public.Wienreb et al. p.481 Abraham's design, although described as having \\"no pretension\\", did not meet with universal approval: for some who remembered Leicester Square as the home of artists Hogarth and Reynolds, the \\"bastard Byzantine architecture\\" was \\"hideous\\" and out of place. The residents of the square were less than pleased with the brick building as Wyld had led them to believe the globe would be housed in a Crystal Palace-like construction of glass and ironwork. The project had cost substantially more than Wyld's budget. In the cases of Miller v Wyld and Abraham v Wyld, he claimed to have set aside £2,000 for the building work, but the estimated final cost was about £5,500, and would have run closer to £13,000 if Wyld had not cancelled the proposed outlying buildings. Abraham opined that Wyld's constant suggestions for (mostly impractical) alterations to the design added to both the cost and duration of the building works. In Household Words, Henry Morley estimated that the cost of producing the model was £20,000 rather than the £13,000 Wyld had quoted to the residents' meeting, or the £4,000 to £5,000 originally estimated. The Great Globe An early view of the Great Globe without the galleries The building, which was reminiscent of the Coliseum in Regent's Park,The British Metropolis p.27 was entered through the newly laid out gardens via one of four loggias facing north (the main entrance), south, east and west, which opened into a large vestibule paved with \\"patent lava\\" and from there through turnstiles into Jermyn's circular corridor. This corridor was hung with examples of Wyld's mapsWells p.80 and there were examples of his guides and globes on display tables. The corridor was decorated with blue arabesques and lit by globe-shaped lamps with crimson tassels hung from ornate beams. The internal pillars were painted in a rich brown and decorated with copies of Moorish architectural designs from the Alhambra in Granada. The inner wall of this corridor was comprised in part by the rendered exterior surface of the Globe itself; the portion visible from within the corridor was painted blue with the positions of the stars in the night sky picked out in silver. The value of the star map as an educational tool was diminished as only a little of the convex face of the Globe was visible above the supporting wall and much of that was obscured by the numerous beams and supports criss- crossing the interior of the corridor. The Architect criticised the internal decoration, much of which was by the theatrical scenery designer William Roxby Beverley, for being too restrained. Besides the circular corridor, Jermyn also designed a Moorish gate for the approach to the Globe's entrance. Four large galleriesThe galleries appear in the plans published in The Builder and later illustrations but not in the earlier illustrations were later built between the loggias to surround the internal corridor and there was a refreshment stand to service the queues waiting to enter the globe. The building was about square and the external walls about high. The domed roof was originally specified in zinc, but Wyld insisted on it being made in lead, which had added to the cost and complexity of the build. Wyld complained that the building had not been finished to a high standard: there were cracks in the plaster and brickwork, leaks from rain, and there were complaints about the smell from the blocked drains almost as soon as the attraction opened to the public. The external diameter of the globe itself was . The frame was formed by 32 large wooden trusses which were in turn supported by a brick enclosure rendered externally in cement. Between the trusses were smaller horizontal ribs from which zinc bands supported plaster casts of the features of the earth created from clay originals. There were about 6,000 of these plaster casts, each about square and thick. These castings had proved particularly problematic – not only did they have to butt together perfectly but they also had to have a tiny curvature to fit to the concave interior of the shell – Wyld had needed three attempts to perfect the design. The production procedure was also time- consuming: the appropriate scale section of the Earth's surface would first be traced out on paper, then transferred to clay modelled with the appropriate topography, from which a mould would be taken; the mould was then tried and any corrections made before a final cast was produced and passed to the painters for decoration. By day the globe was illuminated by the light from the glass set into the dome directly above it and by night with gas lighting. Visitors entered the globe through an opening into the Pacific Ocean, then ascended through a series of four platforms. At each stage they could see a different portion of the world represented on the concave interior face of the globe. The platform scaffolding was built up from the conveniently desolate Southern Ocean; Antarctica was largely unknown at the time – Wyld dismissed stories of the existence of a great Southern continent: The platforms were separated by about and those closer to the Globe's equator were wider so there was always a gap of about between the platform and the surface of the globe. Although the staircase and platforms allowed closer examination of individual sections, the structure prevented an appreciation of the globe as a single unit, and later there were plans for its removal. Some ventilation was provided by a system housed at the North Pole, which had the advantage of being quite featureless and located at the top of the globe, but the heat generated from the gas lighting and the mass of visitors meant the attraction was still uncomfortably hot; Henry Morley remarked that \\"the heat reflected on all sides from the concave surfaces rises to make a little Sahara of the North Pole Station\\", and Punch commented that the temperature was \\"equal to that of any baker's oven.\\" The representation of the Earth's surface was to a scale of 10 miles to the inch (about 6.4 kilometres to the centimetre) in the horizontal plane, but to allow the details of mountain ranges and great craters to be easily observed the altitude scale was ten times that of the surface plane (at one mile to the inch). As the British Quarterly Review remarked in an article on the problems of accurately representing the Earth's features, Wyld would have had to construct a globe with three times the diameter to unify the scales. The depiction of the earth concentrated on physical geography; there were no country names or borders shown. Fertile land was picked out in green and deserts shown in a sandy yellow. The minute detail was less than carefully observed; Wyld aimed for a broad stroke to capture the imagination rather than the accuracy of the Ordnance Survey. Active volcanoes were picked out with a fiery red with cotton wool smoke, and snowy mountains with white crystal that sparkled in the gas light. The Almanack of the Fine Arts for 1852 felt that the globe could \\"scarcely be deemed a work of art\\", but praised some of the fine tinting work.Buss p.144 Attraction This image of the Globe (with completed galleries) shows a placard bearer in the foreground advertising one of Wyld's competitors: The Panorama of Paris and Versailles. The globe was immediately popular; Wyld was a skilful self- promoter and the influx of visitors to London for the Great Exhibition helped in no small part. Figures from the Royal Commissioners showed that admittances to public exhibitions surged in 1851, with some attractions having almost a tenfold increase in visitors; during the five and half months it was open, the Great Exhibition was visited by more than 6 million people. In the first few weeks of the Globe's operation it was seen by an array of \\"distinguished personages\\", including Prince Albert (to whom Wyld had dedicated the project),Wyld p.iv Lord Castlereagh, the Duke of Wellington, the Austrian Ambassador and the King of Belgium. Visitor numbers for the first two years are not recorded,Altick p.467 but around 1.2 million visitors were estimated to have been admitted in 1853 (about 400,000 of these were let in for free). A guide to the attractions of London published to complement the Great Exhibition, Tallis's Illustrated London; in Commemoration of the Great Exhibition of All Nations in 1851. Forming a Complete Guide to The British Metropolis and its Environs by John Tallis included an entry for Wyld's Globe complete with an illustration – a magnanimous gesture on Tallis' part considering that he was one of Wyld's competitors – and most reviews of the Great Globe were complimentary. In 1851, only the Crystal Palace received more visitors. Wyld's Globe was said to be an \\"admirable pendant to the Great Exhibition\\".London as it is to-day pp. 272–3 The globe was open from 10am to 10pm every day except Sundays. Admission cost one shilling, but on Thursdays and Saturdays this rose to two shillings and sixpence. School parties were admitted for half price. Wyld's accompanying guide ran to 132 pages. Wyld produced a book to accompany the exhibition: Notes to Accompany Mr. Wyld's Model of the Earth, Leicester Square, a didactic tome which imparted the wealth of Wyld's geographic and historical knowledge while extolling the virtues of London, Britain, and the Empire and which doubled up as a sales catalogue for Wyld's maps at every opportunity.The introduction makes many mentions of the recent final expedition of John Franklin and ongoing attempts to discover its fate. Franklin had set sail in 1845 in an attempt to traverse the Northwest Passage; he and his crew were not officially pronounced dead until 1854. With the end of the Great Exhibition, Wyld faced a drop in visitor numbers; in an attempt to maintain the popularity of the attraction, he began to expand his half-hourly lectures on the Earth to include popular themes of the day. Although the Globe was still turning a profit, Wyld proposed divesting himself of the enterprise, by selling the land and building to the \\"Cosmos Institute\\" which would add further buildings alongside the Globe to create a national geographic and ethnological museum on the site. Wyld offered to sell the building and land (figures of £20,000–£25,000 were reported as the asking price in The Observer), and to raise the capital for the purchase and the proposed additional building work the Institute issued 50,000 shares of £1. Plans were drawn up by the architect Stephen Geary for the new additions and for the enhancements to the Globe itself; the Institute calculated that the attraction would turn a profit of £4,000 per annum. The issue of the ownership of the land and Wyld's right to sell was a stumbling block though, and the scheme eventually came to nothing despite a bill proposed in Parliament to establish the Institute's title to the land, and the support of \\"a number of noble, learned, and reverend names\\" among them several bishops, the naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, the archaeologist Sir Austen Henry Layard, and the hydrographer Sir Francis Beaufort.Altick p.490 In 1853, Wyld arranged with the prospector John Calvert to exhibit a collection of gold nuggets and precious stones discovered in Australia. The \\"gold\\" was later discovered to be gilded lead casts. Wyld started a court case against Calvert claiming that he had been deceived, but Calvert told the jury that Wyld had always known that the genuine nuggets would not be displayed, had overseen the preparation of the casts and had even planned to drum up ticket sales with an elaborate publicity campaign based around a faked robbery, a charge that Wyld vehemently denied, stating that \\"no one but one who had been the associate of convicts for fifteen years would have ventured to suggest such a question\\" (a none-too-subtle reference to Calvert's time spent in Australia). The jury in the case was unable to reach a verdict, and while opinions differed on whether Wyld had been duped, it was clear that with topical exhibitions he had found a way to reinvigorate the attraction. Wyld put on exhibitions on any subject that was in the public eye; among the most successful were an \\"Oriental Museum\\" which recreated scenes from life in Turkey, Armenia and Albania with dressed rooms and life-size models (and curiously also featured a model of Stonehenge), and a room dedicated to the Crimean War which featured dioramas by the theatrical scene painter Charles Marshall, and later a scale raised-relief map of Sevastopol featuring model armies which was updated daily to show the troop movements. When a large collection of captured Russian weaponry and uniforms was added in 1855 this exhibit attracted greater attention and was visited by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Among the more outlandish attractions were an Arctic exhibition featuring stuffed polar bears alongside a \\"living native of the Arctic regions\\", and the \\"Earthmen\\", a pair of pygmies from a tribe of Southern Africa that according to one hyperbolic advertisement \\"burrowed under the earth ... subsisting on insects and reptiles\\",Durbach p.134 but more reasonably were said to shelter in caves and hollows. Lectures on the exhibits and current events such as the Crimean War or the construction of the Panama Canal were held at regular intervals and \\"guides to knowledge\\" were positioned in the various galleries to assist and inform the visiting public. Competition, closure and demolition A near-neighbour and competitor: the Panopticon of Science and Art which opened in the square in 1854 Although Wyld undoubtedly recouped his investment within the first year of opening, over the remaining nine years of its existence the appeal of the Great Globe slowly waned. The attraction continued to draw crowds, but it was never as successful as in 1851 when the Great Exhibition had pulled visitors into the capital. By the mid-1850s the building was looking shabby and Wyld had been forced to start using it as a venue for variety shows. Competition came from Burford's Panorama in the north of the square which ran topical shows just as Wyld did – Burford ran a panorama show of Sevastopol at the same time as Wyld was exhibiting his model. Burford's Panorama was the oldest of its type in London, having been established in 1790, but there were many similar attractions in the capital, among them the Diorama and the Cyclorama in Regent's Park, the panoramas of \\"London by Day\\" and \\"Paris by Night\\" at the Colosseum, the dioramas at the Gallery of Illustration in Regent Street, and the Panorama of Paris and Versailles in the Linwood Gallery in Leicester Square.London as it is to-day pp. 267–82 The Panopticon of Science and Art, constructed in the square in 1854, also affected visitor numbers. The Panopticon was constructed by a consortium hoping to take advantage of the market for scientific and cultural attractions, but like the Great Globe it struggled to draw sufficient visitors. After two years the Panopticon closed down; it reopened shortly afterwards with the addition of a circus ring, but still proved to be uneconomical and quickly closed again. Renamed the Alhambra, it reopened as a theatre and music-hall in which form it endured until the 20th century. In 1854, the Great Globe was enough in the public eye to inspire an entertainment by James Robinson Planché at the Haymarket: Mr Buckstone's Voyage Round the Globe, but by 1862, there was little question of it continuing to operate even if the Tulks had not been keen to exercise their option to buy. In 1861 in The Adventures of Philip, Thackeray noted that he had heard that the Globe was \\"coming to an end\\". The agreement with the Tulks expired in April 1862, and in the same month, Henry Webb threatened legal action because of Wyld's failure to remove the building and restore the gardens. Wyld was somewhat hamstrung as he had sold the building to William Wilde, the proprietor of the Alhambra, but Wilde had failed to pay and it took two court cases before Wyld regained possession in August. He immediately sold it to a contractor for demolition. In October the building was torn down and the globe itself broken up and sold for scrap. By November the site was completely cleared. Disposal The gardens were finally redesigned in 1874, twelve years after the Great Globe closed and six years after Wyld sold his remaining interest. Wyld's deal with the Tulks had included a promise to restore the gardens, but he showed no signs of making good on the agreement. Stripped of the buildings, the gardens quickly reverted to their former dilapidated state. Even before the globe was dismantled, the building and gardens had deteriorated to such a degree that, speaking in Parliament in July 1861, Lord Overstone commented that \\"in addition to the unsightliness of the structure that had been created in the centre, and the accumulation of everything that was filthy, unseemly, and improper which existed in the enclosure, scenes took place there at a late hour which were most discreditable to the Metropolis\\". The statue of George I was dug up and re-erected, but it had suffered from its ten years underground. The rider may have already been stolen and sold for scrap, and the horse quickly became a target for vandalism; the legs were removed and body was painted with black and white spots. John Augustus Tulk, who had exercised his right to buy half the gardens, was keen to build on the land and proposed creating a covered market to encompass the square and the buildings he owned around it, but the judgement the Tulks had earlier won against Moxhay proved troublesome because it stipulated that the space must be kept as either a garden or a pleasure garden. Popular feeling was that the gardens should be preserved as an open space, and the bill put before Parliament for the establishment of \\"Regent Market\\" was rejected. Tulk attempted to sell his interest in the gardens to a speculator, J. L. Tabberner, but the long negotiations fell through when Tabberner's plans for the garden were rejected and he realized that the other half of the gardens were still owned by Wyld. In January 1865, the Metropolitan Board of Works attempted to seize the gardens under the Town Gardens Protection Act 1863 in order to carry out remedial works. Despite the bill having been proposed precisely for the case of Leicester Square gardens, the attempted seizure was found to be unlawful, and the Board failed to get the decision reversed on appeal.Owen p.148 There were seven descendants of the other branch of the Tulk family that each had been entitled to buy a seventh share of Wyld's remaining half of the garden, and, although the option had expired in 1862, in August 1868 Wyld disposed of his share to them for £1,000. In 1869, Webb, not realising that Wyld had divested himself of his share, attempted to get an injunction to force Tulk and Wyld to restore the gardens, but his request was not granted. The fate of the gardens was finally resolved in 1874 when MP Albert Grant bought the square for £11,060, had it redesigned and donated it to the City of London.Clarke p.256 Legacy Though there was little immediate interest in reviving Wyld's idea, the concept of a giant globe was not altogether forgotten. A slightly smaller convex globe, with a diameter of , featured at the Paris Exposition of 1889.Annual Report of the Smithsonian pp.745–8 Ideas for a gigantic globe at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 were unrealistic – one was for an assembly hall for ten to fifteen thousand people inside a globe supported on the shoulders of a giant, and another was for a globe so large that a lift would be needed to reach the equator and a journey on a specially constructed spiral railway required to reach the North Pole.Hatcher p.50 In 1897, the geographer Thomas Ruddiman Johnston proposed building another giant globe in London. His plan was for a more conventional convex representation of the Earth's topography which visitors could admire from a spiral walkway that would encircle the globe. On a scale of about 8 miles to the inch (roughly 5.2 kilometres to the centimetre), his globe would have been in diameter (almost larger than Wyld's). Although Ruddiman Johnston got as far as preparing some of the sections, the proposal ultimately came to nothing. Élisée Reclus proposed building an even larger version for the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, and plans for the construction were well advanced before the idea was scrapped. Reclus' Great Globe was to be in diameter and feature a 1/500,000 scale globe, a planetarium and a panorama of human evolution. The Cosmorama, an only slightly less ambitious project was built for the Exposition. The Cosmorama, which was located near the foot of the Eiffel Tower, featured a Celestial Sphere.Rayward pp.113–6 Paul Reclus, Élisée's nephew, worked with Sir Patrick Geddes on a globe project for the Outlook Tower in Edinburgh, but none of Geddes' ambitious plans were realised; Reclus produced a small model of what was called \\"The Hollow Globe\\" – a projection of what the earth would look like if it were transparent and viewed from the vantage point of the tower itself – and Geddes created a concave paper celestial sphere which a single person could enter. It was not until 1935 that anything resembling Wyld's Globe was recreated. In 1930 Chester Lindsay Churchill was commissioned to design a new headquarters for the Christian Science Publishing Society. Within his design Churchill included the Mapparium, a giant ball with a concave projection of the earth made up of 608 glass panels and spanned internally by a glass bridge. The Mapparium opened in July 1935 and by October of the same year had received 50,000 visitors.

Despite that, he wanted to become an actor, because he adored Charlie Chaplin. At the age of 15 Wiesnekker started a cook apprenticeship, but did not agree with the “hierarchic structures”. At the age of 16 he planned to become a sports teacher, but soon took up work in a hospital instead. As the job as a male nurse did not satisfy him either, he began working in a ' (“street-kitchen” - a soup kitchen for the homeless and drug-addicted), a job that moulded his character. Later he decided to become an actor. From 1986 to 1989, he frequented the ' (a drama school) in Zürich. Even before he received the diploma, he was engaged by the theatre Schauspielhaus Bochum, Germany. In 1990 he was nominated for the award ' (German talented young actor of the year). Wiesnekker went back to Zürich – despite offers of possible roles abroad. In Zürich he participated in very different productions e.g. in Der Menschenfeind at the Schauspielhaus Zürich. He was already familiar with film acting in 1989, having played a part in short film Karl and afterwards e.g. in the Eurocops series (1991) with Barbara Rudnik (Director: Markus Imboden). Since the summer of 2003 he joint the cast of Swiss sitcom Lüthi und Blanc. In 2005 Wisenekker was awarded the ' (Swiss film award for the best main role) for his role of drug addict policeman Herbert Strähl in Strähl. Ever since then Wiesnekker was able to select his roles himself, even abroad (He speaks German, Swiss German, Dutch, English and French). He likes to learn his lines in crowded pubs.

Although her work covered many areas of theatre and film, she is best known for \\"pushing the envelope\\" of the stage play, devising new forms which challenge and delight unconventional audiences. As a result, her dramatic career is, in many ways, unique in the twentieth century.JELLICOE, (Patricia) Ann, (Mrs Roger Mayne)', Who's Who 2011, A & C Black, 2011; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2010 ; Who's Who 2016, A & C Black, 2016 Biography Jellicoe was born in Middlesbrough, Yorkshire in England in 1927 and from childhood showed an interest and an aptitude for the theatre. She attended Polam Hall School and Queen Margaret's School, York and studied performing arts at the Central School of Speech and Drama. This was followed by experience in repertory and fringe theatre. In 1949, she was commissioned to undertake an investigative study into the relationship between acting and theatre architecture; the finding of this study led her to the Open stage. Jellicoe established a Sunday Theatre Club (Cockpit Theatre Club) where she produced and directed a number of plays exploring the possibilities of this form of Open stage theatre, including a one-act of her own. Thereafter, Jellicoe used many of her plays to further explore her innovative ideas on theatre. In 1956, The Observer established a playwright's competition to find new talent. Jellicoe submitted The Sport of My Mad Mother, which won a prize in the competition.Kate Dorney. Interview with Jellicoe, deposited at British Library. In writing this play Jellicoe applied many of the ideas she had learnt in her early years at Central School. The play was subsequently staged by the Royal Court Theatre and directed by George Devine and Jellicoe. Although originally a commercial failure, the play was later performed internationally in many languages. Set in a Cockney neighbourhood of London, it combines realism, mysticism, music, dance, and ritual to create a powerful, feminist myth about modern civilisation. Jellicoe revised the original 1958 version in 1962 to create a better play. The play's title derives from a Hindu religious saying: \\"All creation is the sport of my mad mother Kali\\" (a Hindu goddess). However, as most Londoners know, \\"the sport of me mad mother\\" is also a Cockney expression implying something highly unusual. Jellicoe's best known play is The Knack first performed at the Royal Court in 1962. A major hit, the play was later adapted into a film version which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes.Internet Movie Data Base Listing. IMDB.com Directed by Richard Lester; the film's cast included Michael Crawford and Rita Tushingham. In it a group of young, London adults clash and commiserate about how to get \\"the knack\\" with the opposite sex. Jellicoe has also written plays for children. One of Jellicoe's most interesting works is a brief essay entitled, \\"Some Unconscious Influences in the Theatre.\\" In a space of about thirty pages, she devises a number of complex yet common-sense theories which account for the reasons why audiences react to stage and screen as they do. =The Colway Theatre Trust= In 1978, Jellicoe set up the Colway Theatre Trust to explore the concept of Community Plays: pioneering work which she continued to develop over the next ten years. Jon Oram became artistic director of Colway Theatre in 1985 – now called Claque Theatre. Colway Theatre Trust are the founders of the Community Play genre. A community play as practised by Colway is the result of no less than 18 months work. They are original plays written for and about a specific community. The writer generally works with a community research team. Plays are traditionally performed in a promenade style where the audience and cast share the same space with action happening on stages around the edge of that space and in the body of the standing audience. In 2000, Colway Theatre relocated to Kent in South East England and changed its name to Claque. The company is of international standing, run by Jon Oram who has written, produced or directed over 40 productions. In 1962, Jellicoe married the photographer Roger Mayne. They moved to Lyme Regis in Dorset in 1975, and lived at Colway Manor (hence the name of the Colway Theatre Trust). After Mayne died in 2014, Jellicoe moved to West Bay in Dorset.

The members of the government are the Prime Minister, the deputy prime ministers, and the federal ministers. It has its legal basis in the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the federal constitutional law \\"On the Government of the Russian Federation\\".Russian Government web portal – Text of 1997 Federal Constitutional Law \\"On the Government of the Russian Federation\\" (in Russian) The Apparatus of the Government of Russia is a governmental body which administrates the activities of the government According to the 1991 amendment to the 1978 Russian Constitution, the President of Russia was the head of the executive branch and headed the Council of Ministers of Russia. According to the current 1993 Constitution of Russia, the President is not a part of the Government of Russia, which exercises executive power. But, the President does appoint the Prime Minister. The Chapter 6 of the Constitution of Russia says, that \\"The Government of the Russian Federation consists of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation (Prime Minister), Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation and federal ministries\\". History The large body was preceded by Government of the Soviet Union. Since the Russian Federation emerged from 1991 to 1992, the government's structure has undergone several major changes. In the initial years, a large number of government bodies, primarily the different ministries, underwent massive reorganization as the old Soviet governing networks were adapted to the new state. Many reshuffles and renamings occurred. On 28 November 1991, President of the RSFSR Boris Yeltsin signed presidential decree No.242 \\"On the reorganization of the government bodies of the RSFSR\\". Yeltsin officially declared the end of the Soviet Union and became the President of the Russian Federation. Yeltsin was a reformer and promised Western-styled democracy. In 1993 the new Russian Constitution was adopted. The new Constitution gained legitimacy through its bicameral legislature, an independent judiciary, the position of the president and the prime minister, and democratic features. These democratic features included competitive multi-party elections, separation of powers, federalism, and protection of civil liberties. In 1999, Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin as the Prime Minister. Later in that year, Yeltsin resigned from the presidency, and Putin took over. In 2000 Putin won the presidential election. The most recent change took place on 21 January 2020, when President Vladimir Putin signed a presidential decree on forming Mikhail Mishustin's Cabinet. Responsibilities and power The Government is the subject of the 6th chapter of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. According to the constitution, the government of the Russian Federation must: #Draft and submit the federal budget to the State Duma; ensure the implementation of the budget and report on its implementation to the State Duma; #Ensure the implementation of a uniform financial, credit and monetary policy in the Russian Federation ; #Ensure the implementation of a uniform state policy in the areas of culture, science, education, health protection, social security and ecology; #Manage federal property; #Adopt measures to ensure the country's defense, state security, and the implementation of the foreign policy of the Russian Federation; #Implement measures to ensure the rule of law, human rights and freedoms, the protection of property and public order, and crime control; #Exercise any other powers vested in it by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, federal laws and presidential decrees.The Constitution of the Russian Federation: Chapter 6 The government issues its acts in the way of decisions (Постановления) and orders (Распоряжения). These must not contradict the constitution, federal constitutional laws, federal laws, and Presidential decrees, and are signed by the Prime Minister. The Government, also assists the Prime Minister, in faithfully carrying out the country's domestic and foreign policy as determined by the President, in general.

It was founded in 1948, and is located on the Cronenbourg Campus of the University of Strasbourg. Each year 90 students graduate from the school with a diplôme d'ingénieur. It is a National School of Engineers, part of the University of Strasbourg and a member of the Fédération Gay-Lussac, which recruits from the common polytechnic entrance examination. It is also part of the Alsace Tech network of nine engineering schools in Alsace. The ECPM offers its students three specialties: chemistry (analytical or organic), polymers or materials.  History  1919 - Creation of the chemical institute by the professors T.Muller and H.Gault. Lectures are taught rue Goethe in Strasbourg. 1948 - Creation at the same place of the Ecole nationale supérieure de chimie (ENSCS) by the professor H. Forestier. 1962 - The Ecole de chimie has place in new premises (tour de la Chimie) on the campus central de l'Esplanade. The first practical sessions from the ENSCS in analytical chemistry begin at the start of the school year 1962. 1968 - The ENSCS becomes a public organization. 1981 - The professor M. Daire introduces the European teaching program. 1986 - The ENSCS becomes Ecole Européenne des hautes études des industries chimiques de Strasbourg (EHICS) 1995 - The EHICS, the Ecole d'application des hauts Polymères and the Magistère matériaux de l'université de Strasbourg-I group together and form the Ecole de chimie, Polymères et Matériaux (ECPM). 1998-1999 - The ECPM moves to new premises on the University's Cronenbourg campus. 2006 - Strasbourg becomes business cluster of the French chemistry. 2009 - The université Louis Pasteur and the other universities of Strasbourg are joined and form l'Université de Strasbourg 2011 - Opening of the new Classe préparatoire intégrée internationale (CP2I) - CHEM.I.ST. at the start of the school year 2011.  Admission to ECPM  → To enter the First year: \\\\- The school recruit essentially with the «Concours Communs Polytechniques» (CCP) or the DEUG (which are national competitive exams). \\\\- The admission could also be done by an interview with a License 3 in Chemistry or in Physics at the university, a DUT (university diploma of technology) for example, in Chemistry, physical measurements optional materials or chemical engineering. \\\\- For international students, they must have a Bachelor of science or an equivalent foreign degree. \\\\- After 2 years in CPI classes at Rennes (ENSCR), Lille(ENSCL), Clermont-Ferrand (ENSCCF) or in Strasbourg (ECPM: referred to the CPI classe's paragraph). → To enter the Second year, students can have access at the ECPM having an interview, with a Master M1 in Physics with a speciality in Polymers or materials. → Admission to the CP2i class in the ECPM, after the Baccalaureate, or an equivalent foreign degree for the international students. There is no competitive exam, but every student should submit their school results. Then there are interviews to evaluate the motivations with the people in charge of the Chem.I.St programme. Approximately 50 students are selected every year. There are nearly 20% international students.  CP2I / Classe préparatoire intégrée internationale  This class allows the students to gain admission to a school of the Fédération Gay Lussac (19 schools) after two years. These 2 years consist of studying engineer's trades in the domain of chemistry. There are 5 CPIs in France: Rennes, Clermont-Ferrand, Lille, Pau and Strasbourg at the ECPM The last one was opened at the start of the 2011-12 school year in Strasbourg. The speciality of this school is that it welcomes a large number of international students, as well as that 20% of the courses are delivered in English and 10% are delivered in German (optional). There are 50 students in each year. To gain admission to the CP2I: * French students register on Admission Post-Bac and follow the steps. Students are selected on the basis of their academic record and a 20-minute interview. * International students submit their dossiers directly to the school. International students are also selected on the basis of their academic record and an interview. General presentation of CPI-CHEM.I.ST : * A strong scientific program: a major part of chemistry, physics and maths during the 2 years with a total, for the first year, of around 700 hours of scientific lesson. We must add Lab Work of this scientific formation, with a total of 102 hours for the first year. The CPI-CHEM.I.ST base of more practical work than in an intensive foundation degree, with high- quality laboratory. The program includes group work to develop the communication, the creativity around scientists projects. Moreover, in 2016, a \\"videxo\\" program was created. During, the \\"videxo\\" student solves a science problem on a board and in the same time someone films him to send the video to the teachers. The goal of this is to promote self-confidence, speaking, and the scientist reflexion which are important qualities for the future engineer. * An international program in a multicultural environment: many students with different cultures and two foreign languages to learn. At the beginning of the formation, students can participate in an English language session for one week in order to learn the fundamentals of the scientific English. Insertions travels are organised at the end of the first year in Germany or in England. The students will participate in lectures and lab work in a foreign university. Most of the time the foreign students come from China. Speciality The speciality is chosen in the second year. Students have four possibilities: Chemistry: Organic Chemistry: With this speciality, students attain a high level in synthesis and characterization of organic chemistry. Analytical Chemistry: Students are trained in techniques of analysis within the context of quality control. Polymers: Students are trained to become flexible engineers in the polymer industry. Materials: Students are trained in physics and chemistry of functional materials. Students become engineers specializing in conception and development of materials with an added value. Community life There are several associations managed by school's students : \\\\- l'Amicale (BDE) (or Student Union ): It manages the associative and festive life of the school, organizes students foyer's functioning, publishes students' directory and organizes events like, for example, new students integration's weekend. About ten clubs exist in the association like the Arts' Office, DéméTerre (sustainable development), Theatre Club, Manga Club, Cine Club, Gastronomy Club, study trip, etc. \\\\- Le Bureau des Sports (BDS° (or Sports Office) : It allows students to do sport, to participate in university competitions and organizes events like a nice trip at the month for a weekend or at the Tournoi Inter-Chimie (TIC) in spring. Moreover, the ECPM won this sports and festive event in 2006 which has been organized in Mulhouse. \\\\- Le \\"Forum Horizon Chimie\\" (FHC) : It's the ECPM's association that organize a forum which happens every year at la Maison de la Chimie in Paris. Moreover, a junior company, Strasbourg Chimie Service, allows students-employed to make some punctual missions like chemical analyses, scientific conferences or translations of publications. It also exists l'Amicale des Ingénieurs de Chimie de Strasbourg (Association of the Strasbourg's Engineers of Chemistry). It's an association aiming at conservation and relations' strengthening between graduates and students. It has in particular for ultimate objective the creation of a robust and big network ECPM, a very great tool for a successful career. -Student common room The ECPM Student common room is the center of the school. It is a place where students can relax after lunch or during off-peak times. It is a big place where you can find a table football, a billiard table, many couches and tables and even a microwave. In fact, it is possible to eat food you’ve brought. Moreover, there is a mezzanine with a hi- fi system, which makes you think of a nightclub and a terrace which is surrounded by trees and is really cozy. Everyone has the right to go to the student common room, the students in the engineering cycle and the CPI’s. Furthermore, the BDE and the BDS (respectively student union and sports office) sometime organize parties in the student common room (for example barbecues) to bring the whole school together. For example, there is the Welcome Party every year for new students. Partners and networks The ECPM participated to many different networks in order to communicate with factories, institutions or students. That different networks are : -The Gay- Lussac federation: The federation was found by Louis Joseph Gay Lussac. It regroups no more than 20 schools of chemistry and chemical engineering. These 20 schools, through their teaching activities, research and training, are working together to raise awareness, develop and promote engineering courses in chemistry. -The network “Alsace Tech“: Alsace Tech regroups 12 reputed engineering, management and architecture schools of Alsace. Its main objective is to promote, to contribute to the national and international influence and to increase the legibility of its schools' members.  Scientific Research  The ECPM is a hub for scientific research. Five laboratories associated with the CNRS form the ECPM's research federation. The fields of research are varied: materials, catalysis, polymers, organic synthesis, analysis of biomolecules. The laboratories collaborate with industries and major European research organizations as part of European agreements. A 1000m² hall with a cleanroom further the exchanges with industry. Associated Laboratories \\\\- The SYBIO Laboratory (Synthèse Organique et Molécules Bioactives) \\\\- Laboratoire de Chimie Bioorganique et Médicale \\\\- The Nierengarten group \\\\- Laboratoire de Synthèse et Catalyse Asymétrique (SynCat) \\\\- Laboratoire de Chimie organométallique  Food services  You can find different kinds of food services in and around the campus. \\\\- Restaurant universitaire (RU): this is the place where the majority of the students come everyday. The choice is between three different main courses: today's special, world's dish, and the grill. Patrons can also take a starter and a dessert, the whole for 3€15. Dining is in a large room with all the campus' students: CPI, engineers, and students of the IUT Louis Pasteur. \\\\- Mini R : It's a new concept ! It's located above the RU. The principle is the same as a cafeteria. You choose what you want: sandwiches, fagottini, fruits, desserts, drinks, and some hot food like pizzas, paninis, pasta and wok boxes, kebab, hot dog, etc. One can eat there or take away. \\\\- Vending machine: in the school, next to the coffee machine. There are several kinds of sandwiches, but all of them are industrial. \\\\- In the common room: it is mainly the place where the engineers eat because they are contributors (prices are less expansive for them). For those bringing food from their flat, you can warm up there; there are ovens and stovetops. \\\\- Fast food and supermarkets: Finally, there is an area next to the IUT Louis Pasteur with fast food like Mac Donald, Mezzo di Pasta or supermarkets (Liddl, Intermarché).  Ranking  According to the Point newspaper, the ECPM was ranked 18th in 2007 and was the leading chemistry schools in that rank (excluding chemical engineering) before the ENSCP which occupied the 30th rank. According to L'Express, the school was ranked 27th as a post-prépa engineering school in 2008, behind the National School of Chemistry of Paris in the category of chemistry schools. Concerning starting incomes, the ECPM was ranked 10th by L'Usine Nouvelle in 2007. In the same newspaper, the ECPM is ranked 6th as a school betting on self-knowledge, that is to say, a school devoting a large part to non-scientific lectures. *see the French article Category:Chemistry education Ecole europeenne Category:Engineering universities and colleges in France ","title":"École européenne de chimie, polymères et matériaux"},{"id":"9787403","text":"Kevin Hughes is an All-Ireland-winning Tyrone Gaelic footballer.

Soon after its creation, the Station developed a new, deadlier vision of bin Laden's activities. The CIA inaugurated a grand plan against al-Qaeda in 1999, but struggled to find the resources to implement it. In 2000, a joint CIA-USAF project using Predator reconnaissance drones and following a program drawn up by the bin Laden Station produced probable sightings of the al-Qaeda leader in Afghanistan. Resumption of flights in 2001 was delayed by arguments over a missile-armed version of the aircraft. Only on September 4, 2001, was the go- ahead given for weapons-capable drones. Conception, birth and growth The idea was born from discussions within the CIA's senior management, and that of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center (CTC). David Cohen, head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, and others, wanted to try out a virtual station, modeled on the Agency's overseas stations, but based near Washington DC and dedicated to a particular issue. The unit \\"would fuse intelligence disciplines into one office—operations, analysis, signals intercepts, overhead photography and so on\\". Cohen had trouble getting any Directorate of Operations officer to run the unit. He finally recruited Michael Scheuer, an analyst then running the CTC's Islamic Extremist Branch; Scheuer \\"was especially knowledgeable about Afghanistan\\". Scheuer, who \\"had noticed a recent stream of reports about Bin Ladin and something called al Qaeda\\", suggested that the new unit \\"focus on this one individual\\" Cohen agreed. 9/11 Commission website The Station opened in January 1996, as a unit under the CTC. Scheuer set it up and headed it from that time until spring 1999. The Station was an interdisciplinary group, drawing on personnel from the CIA, FBI, NSA, DIA and elsewhere in the intelligence community. Formally known as the Bin Ladin Issue Station, it was codenamed Alec Station, after Michael Scheuer's son's name, as referred to by DIA's Able Danger liaison Anthony Shaffer.Inside Able Danger (Shaffer interview), Government Security News, August 2005. By 1999, the unit's staff had nicknamed themselves the \\"Manson Family\\", \\"because they had acquired a reputation for crazed alarmism about the rising al-Qaeda threat\\". The Station originally had twelve professional staff members, including CIA analyst Alfreda Frances Bikowsky and former FBI agent Daniel Coleman. This figure grew to 40–50 employees by September 11, 2001. (The CTC as a whole had about 200 and 390 employees at the same dates.) CIA chief George Tenet later described the Station's mission as \\"to track [bin Laden], collect intelligence on him, run operations against him, disrupt his finances, and warn policymakers about his activities and intentions\\". By early 1999 the unit had \\"succeeded in identifying assets and members of Bin Laden's organization ...\\". New view of al-Qaeda, 1996–1998 Soon after its inception, the Station began to develop a new, deadlier vision of al-Qaeda. In May 1996, Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl walked into a US embassy in Africa and established his credentials as a former senior employee of bin Laden. Al-Fadl had lived in the US in the mid-1980s, and had been recruited to the Afghan mujaheddin through the al-Khifa center at the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn. Al-Khifa was the interface of Operation Cyclone, the American effort to support the mujaheddin, and the Peshawar, Pakistan- based Services Office of Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin Laden, whose purpose was to raise recruits for the struggle against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Al-Fadl had joined al-Qaeda in 1989, apparently in Afghanistan. Peter Bergen called him the third member of the organization (presumably after Azzam and bin Laden). But al-Fadl had since embezzled $110,000 from al-Qaeda, and now wanted to defect. Al-Fadl was persuaded to come to the United States by Jack Cloonan, an FBI special agent who had been seconded to the bin Laden Issue Station. There, from late 1996, under the protection of Cloonan and his colleagues, al- Fadl \\"provided a major breakthrough on the creation, character, direction and intentions of al Qaeda\\". \\"Bin Laden, the CIA now learned, had planned multiple terrorist operations and aspired to more\\"—including the acquisition of weapons-grade uranium. Another \\"walk-in\\" source (since identified as L'Houssaine Kherchtou) \\"corroborated\\" al-Fadl's claims. \\"By the summer of 1998\\", Scheuer later summed up, \\"we had accumulated an extraordinary array of information on [al-Qaeda] and its intentions.\\" > The reams of new information that the CIA's Bin Ladin unit had been > developing since 1996 had not been pulled together and synthesized for the > rest of the government. Indeed, analysts in the unit felt that they were > viewed as alarmists even within the CIA. A National Intelligence Estimate on > terrorism in 1997 had only briefly mentioned Bin Ladin, and no subsequent > national estimate would authoritatively evaluate the terrorism danger until > after 9/11.

First capture plan and US embassy attacks, 1997–98 In May 1996, bin Laden moved from Sudan to Afghanistan. Scheuer saw the move as a (further) \\"stroke of luck\\". Though the CIA had virtually abandoned Afghanistan after the fall of the Soviet puppet regime in 1991, case officers had re-established some contacts while tracking down Kasi, the Pakistani gunman who had murdered two CIA employees in 1993. \\"One of the contacts was a group associated with particular tribes among Afghanistan's ethnic Pashtun community.\\" The team, dubbed \\"TRODPINT\\" by the CIA, was provisioned with arms, equipment and cash by the CTC, and set up residence around Kandahar. Kasi was captured in June 1997. CTC chief Jeff O'Connell then \\"approved a plan to transfer the Afghans agent teams from the [CIA's] Kasi cell to the bin Laden unit\\". By autumn 1997, the Station had roughed out a plan for TRODPINT to capture bin Laden and hand him over for trial, either to the US or an Arab country. In early 1998 the Cabinet-level Principals Committee apparently gave their blessing, but the scheme was abandoned in the spring for fear of collateral fatalities during a capture attempt. In August 1998, militants truck-bombed the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. President Clinton ordered cruise-missile strikes on bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan. But there was no \\"follow-up\\" action to these strikes. New leadership and the new Plan, 1999 In December 1998, CIA chief Tenet \\"declared war\\" on Osama bin Laden. Early in 1999, Tenet \\"ordered the CTC to begin a 'baseline' review of the CIA's operational strategy against bin Laden\\". In the spring he \\"demanded 'a new, comprehensive plan of attack' against bin Laden and his allies\\". J. Cofer Black, CTC Director 1999–2002 As an evident part of the new strategy, Tenet removed Michael Scheuer from the leadership of the Bin Laden Station. (Later that year Scheuer resigned from the CIA.) Tenet appointed Richard Blee, a \\"fast-track executive assistant\\" who \\"came directly from Tenet's leadership group\\", to have authority over the Station. \\"Tenet quickly followed this appointment with another: He named Cofer Black as director of the entire CTC.\\" The CTC produced a \\"comprehensive plan of attack\\" against bin Laden and \\"previewed the new strategy to senior CIA management by the end of July 1999. By mid-September, it had been briefed to CIA operational level personnel, and to [the] NSA [National Security Agency], the FBI, and other partners.\\" The strategy \\"was called simply, 'the Plan'.\\" > [Cofer] Black and his new bin Laden unit wanted to \\"project\\" into > Afghanistan, to \\"penetrate\\" bin Laden's sanctuaries. They described their > plan as military officers might. They sought to surround Afghanistan with > secure covert bases for CIA operations–as many bases as they could arrange. > Then they would mount operations from each of the platforms, trying to move > inside Afghanistan and as close to bin Laden as they could get to recruit > agents and to attempt capture operations. Black also arranged for a CIA team, headed by Alec Station chief Blee, to visit Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud to discuss operations against bin Laden. The mission was codenamed \\"JAWBREAKER-5\\", the fifth in a series of such missions since autumn 1997. The team went in late October 1999. After the meeting, Alec Station believed that Massoud would be a second source of information on bin Laden. > [T]he CIA considered the possibility of putting U.S. personnel on the ground > in Afghanistan. The CIA had been discussing this option with Special > Operations Command and found enthusiasm on the working level but reluctance > at higher levels. CIA saw a 95 percent chance of Special Operations Command > forces capturing Bin Ladin if deployed – but less than a 5 percent chance of > such a deployment. > Once Cofer Black had finalized his operational plan in the fall of 1999 to > go after al-Qa'ida, Allen [the associate deputy director of central > intelligence for collection] created a dedicated al-Qa'ida cell with > officers from across the intelligence community. This cell met daily, > brought focus to penetrating the Afghan sanctuary, and ensured that > collection initiatives were synchronized with operational plans. Allen met > with [Tenet] on a weekly basis to review initiatives under way. His efforts > were enabling operations and pursuing longer-range, innovative initiatives > around the world against al-Qa'ida. Tenet testified that \\"by September 11, 2001, a map would show that these collection programs and human networks nearly covered Afghanistan.\\" =The core 9/11 hijackers emerge= Beginning in September 1999, the CTC picked up multiple signs that bin Laden had set in motion major terrorist attacks for the turn of the year. The CIA set in motion the \\"largest collection and disruption activity in the history of mankind\\" (as Cofer Black later put it). The CTC focused in particular on three groups of Qaeda personnel: those known to have been involved in terrorist attacks; and senior personnel both outside and inside Afghanistan—e.g. \\"operational planner Abu Zubaydah\\" and \\"Bin Ladin deputy Muhammad Atef\\". Amid this activity, in November and December 1999, Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah and Nawaf al-Hazmi visited Afghanistan, where they were selected for the \\"planes operation\\" that was to become known as 9/11. Al-Hazmi undertook guerrilla training at al-Qaeda's Mes Aynak camp (along with two Yemenis who were unable to get US entry visas). The camp was located in an abandoned Russian copper mine near Kabul, and was for a time in 1999 the only such training camp in operation. Atta, al-Shehhi and Jarrah met Muhammad Atef and bin Laden in Kandahar, and were instructed to go back to Germany to undertake pilot training. At about this time the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger also identified a potential Qaeda unit, consisting of the future leading 9/11 hijackers Atta, al-Shehhi, al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al- Hazmi. It termed them the \\"Brooklyn cell\\", because of some associations with the New York district. Evidently at least some of the men were physically and legally present in the United States, since there was an ensuing legal tussle over the \\"right\\" of \\"quasi-citizens\\" not to be spied on.\\"Inside Able Danger\\" (Shaffer interview), Government Security News, August 2005 In late 1999, the National Security Agency (NSA), following up information from the FBI's investigation of the 1998 US embassy attacks, picked up traces of \\"an operational cadre\\", consisting of Nawaf al-Hazmi, his companion Khalid al- Mihdhar and Nawaf's younger brother Salem, who were planning to go to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in January 2000. Seeing a connection with the attacks, a CTC officer sought permission to surveil the men. The CIA tracked al-Hazmi and al- Mihdhar as they traveled to and attended the al-Qaeda summit in Kuala Lumpur during the first week of January 2000. \\"The Counterterrorist Center had briefed the CIA leadership on the gathering in Kuala Lumpur ... The head of the Bin Ladin unit [Richard] kept providing updates\\", unaware at first that the information was out-of-date. When two FBI agents assigned to the station, Mark Rossini and Doug Miller, learned that al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar had entry visas to the United States, they attempted to alert the FBI. CIA officials in management positions over the FBI agents denied their request to pass along this information to FBI headquarters. Michael Scheuer would later deny this, instead blaming the FBI for not having a \\"useable computer system\\".Bill and Dick, Osama and Sandy, Michael Scheuer, Washington Times, 2006, July 4 In March 2000, it was learned that al-Hazmi had flown to Los Angeles. The men were not registered with the State Department's TIPOFF list, nor was the FBI told. There are also allegations that the CIA surveilled Mohamed Atta in Germany from the time he returned there in January/February 2000, until he left for the US in June 2000.\\"January–May 2000: CIA Has Atta Under Surveillance\\", Able Danger , from Complete 9/11 Timeline, Center for Cooperative Research Predator drone, 2000–2001 In spring 2000, officers from the Bin Laden Station joined others in pressing for \\"Afghan Eyes\\", the Predator reconnaissance drone program for locating bin Laden in Afghanistan. In the summer, \\"The bin Laden unit drew up maps and plans for fifteen Predator flights, each lasting just under twenty-four hours.\\" The flights were scheduled to begin in September. In autumn 2000, officers from the Station were present at Predator flight control in the CIA's Langley headquarters, alongside other officers from the CTC, and US Air Force drone pilots. Several possible sightings of bin Laden were obtained as drones flew over his Tarnak- Farms residence near Kandahar. Late in the year, the program was suspended because of bad weather. Resumption of flights in 2001 was delayed by arguments over an armed Predator. A drone equipped with adapted \\"Hellfire\\" anti-tank missiles could be used to try to kill bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders. Cofer Black and the bin Laden unit were among the advocates. But there were both legal and technical issues. In the summer the CIA \\"conducted classified war games at Langley ... to see how its chain of command might responsibly oversee a flying robot that could shoot missiles at suspected terrorists\\"; a series of live-fire tests in the Nevada desert (involving a mockup of bin Laden's Tarnak residence) produced mixed results. Tenet advised cautiously on the matter at a meeting of the Cabinet-level Principals Committee on September 4, 2001. If the Cabinet wanted to empower the CIA to field a lethal drone, Tenet said, \\"they should do so with their eyes wide open, fully aware of the potential fallout if there were a controversial or mistaken strike\\". National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice concluded that the armed Predator was required, but evidently not ready. It was agreed to recommend to the CIA to resume reconnaissance flights. The \\"previously reluctant\\" Tenet then ordered the Agency to do so. The CIA was now \\"authorized to deploy the system with weapons-capable aircraft, but for reconnaissance missions only\\", since the host nation (presumably Uzbekistan) \\"had not agreed to allow flights by weapons-carrying aircraft\\". > Subsequent to 9/11, approval was quickly granted to ship the missiles, and > the Predator aircraft and missiles reached their overseas location on > September 16, 2001. The first mission was flown over Kabul and [Kandahar] on > September 18 without carrying weapons. Subsequent host nation approval was > granted on October 7 and the first armed mission was flown on the same day. After 9/11 Shortly after 9/11, Michael Scheuer came back to the Station as special adviser. He stayed until 2004.Dana Priest, \\"Former Chief of CIA's Bin Laden Unit Leaves\\", The Washington Post, November 12, 2004, p. A04 After the September 11 attacks, staff numbers at the Station were expanded into the hundreds. Scheuer claimed the expansion was a \\"shell game\\" played with temporary (and inexperienced) staff, and that the core personnel \\"remained at under 30, the size it was when Scheuer left office in 1999\\".Julian Borger, \\"We could have stopped him\\", The Guardian (UK), August 20, 2004. (As we have seen, professional staff numbers grew to 40 to 50 by the eve of 9/11.) After 9/11, \\"Hendrik V.\\", and later \\"Marty M.\\", were chiefs of Alec Station's Bin Laden Unit.Tenet, At The Center Of The Storm, p. 232. The Bin Laden Station was disbanded in late 2005. Bin Laden was eventually located in Abbottabad, Pakistan and killed by the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group, commonly known as SEAL Team 6 in Operation Neptune Spear on May 2, 2011.

History Stamps for German South West Africa postmarked Cap Cross 1900 The Portuguese navigator and explorer Diogo Cão was in 1484 ordered by King João II, as part of the search for a sea route to India and the Spice Islands, to advance south into undiscovered regions along the west coast of Africa. While doing so, he was to choose some particularly salient points and claim them for Portugal by setting up on each a stone cross called padrão. During his first voyage, thought to have taken place in 1482, he reached a place he called Monte Negro, now called Cabo de Santa Maria, roughly 150 km southwest of today's Benguela, Angola. During his second voyage, in 1484–1486, Cão reached Cape Cross in January 1486, being the first European to visit this area. During this voyage he proceeded c. 1,400 km farther than during the first one. He is known to have erected two padrãos in the areas beyond his first voyage, one in Monte Negro, and the second at Cape Cross. The current name of the place is derived from this padrão. What can today be found at Cape Cross are two replicas of that first cross.Encyclopædia Britannica: Diogo Cão. Cão's first expedition took place only six years, and the second expedition's end only two years before Bartholomeu Dias successfully rounded the Cape of Good Hope as the first European explorer in 1488.  Padrão  Cape Cross inscription, modern copy at site The original Cape Cross padrão was removed in 1893 by Corvette captain Gottlieb Becker, commander of the SMS Falke of the German Navy, and taken to Berlin. The cross is now held in the Deutsches Historisches Museum. A simple wooden cross was put in its place. The wooden cross was replaced two years later by a stone replica. At the end of the 20th century, thanks to private donations, another cross, more similar to the original one, was erected at Cape Cross, and thus there are now two crosses there. The inscription on the padrão reads, in English translation: Seal reserve A confrontation at the Cape Cross seal colony Today Cape Cross is a protected area owned by the government of Namibia under the name Cape Cross Seal Reserve. The reserve is the home of one of the largest colonies of Cape fur seals in the world. Cape Cross is one of two main sites in Namibia (the other is in Lüderitz) where seals are culled, partly for selling their hides and partly for protecting the fish stock. The economic impact of seals on the fish resources is controversial: While a government- initiated study found that seal colonies consume more fish than the entire fishing industry can catch, animal protection society Seal Alert South Africa estimated less than 0.3% losses to commercial fisheries.

The natural environment of the area attracts visitors, and the village is in close proximity to the Mount Tomah Botanic Garden and the Wollemi and Blue Mountains national parks. The area was first visited by Europeans in November 1804 when George Caley, the explorer and botanist, camped nearby during his unsuccessful attempt to cross the Blue Mountains. The area has had European settlement since at least 1832 when the property 'Bulgamatta' was established; now the location of the Chapel Hill Retreat. During the mid-nineteenth century Bells Line of Road was a busy thoroughfare for herds of sheep and cattle being driven to the Sydney markets. The following description of Berambing, by an anonymous correspondent, was published in January 1861: > Berambing is between two and three miles from the summit of Mount Tomah, > which is concealed by the intervening forest; but its elevation is > considerable, and the climate is cool, bracing, and agreeable, and to those > who can really appreciate nature there is a rich fund of enjoyment, and a > field of research rendered doubly interesting from having been the scene of > some of Allan Cunningham's botanical wanderings...

He was originally from Punjab. He started his career in 1920 as a coal trader in Calcutta, and built up the family fortune through Karam Chand Thapar and Bros. He then started JCT Limited that is into textiles as well as molasses and alcohol. He also took over the Oriental Bank of Commerce, and ventured into paper manufacturing with the Ballarpur Industries Limited. In 1956, he started Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology which was given the status of Deemed University in 1985 and renamed as Thapar University.  Biography  Thapar established Karam Chand Thapar & Bros. Ltd. - the parent company of Karam Chand Thapar & Bros. (Coal Sales) Ltd. (KCT). Having gained some experience of the coal industry in his youth, Thapar set out to establish his own coal trading business based out of the Jharia coalfields in 1919. Soon thereafter, he realized that the epicenter of the coal business was not where the mines were located, but in Calcutta, the then established base of all the large European owned mining companies. A year later, in 1920, he set out for Calcutta, the erstwhile capital of India. That same year, he started a successful coal distribution business based out of Calcutta. As a leader, Thapar managed to consolidate a diverse group of investors and contractors, and incorporate them into his coal distribution network. Thapar did not focus on coal alone but also ventured into other fields like paper, textiles, chemicals, sugar as well as banking (Oriental Bank of Commerce) and insurance (United Indian Insurance). In 1929, the flagship parent company of the Thapar Group, Karam Chand Thapar & Bros. Ltd., was formed. In the course of time, various companies owned and/or managed by KThapar were brought under its umbrella.  Personal life  Born in 1900, Thapar died in 1963 and was survived by four sons: Inder Mohan Thapar, Brij Mohan Thapar, Lalit Mohan Thapar, and Man Mohan Thapar. Following Thapar's death, his third son Lalit was made head of the business, with the undertaking that the latter would ensure that Inder Mohan's son would be given the reins after he would turn 65 and that all of Lalit's brothers would be given their due share of the family business. Lalit stood by his word to his dying father and did over the years divide the group among his brothers; his not marrying helped his cause by not adding more claimants to the group assets. However he gave the reins of the bigger part of the company to Gautam Thapar, son of Brij Mohan, and gave the chemicals division to Vikram Thapar, the son of Inder Mohan. Lalit is Naina Lal Kidwai's uncle  References  External links * Business Houses list * Businessweek mention in 1997 * Telegraph India article on family division * JCT textiles website * Engineering

During World War II, he served as a Flying Officer with the RAAF between 1942 and 1945,Taylor, Percy, \\"Melbourne are Proud of their Great War Record\\", The Australasian, (Saturday, 24 June 1944), p.23. and he saw action in New Guinea and the nearby islands. Two of his brothers served in the Australian Army during the same conflict. On his return he took up his trade as an industrial chemist and analyst in a Melbourne business. La Fontaine died in Sydney in August 1999 and is buried in Macquarie Park Cemetery. Football career Recruited to the Old Paradians by its founder Lou Arthur, La Fontaine vindicated the transport magnate's faith by booting an incredible 143 goals in the football club's inaugural season of 1929. His football career changed dramatically when he was later recruited from University Blacks. In his last year (1933) as an amateur he kicked a record 197 goals for the season. He was considered a brilliant amateur full- forward, and was to earn his fame playing with the Melbourne Football Club as a centreman. He was appointed captain of Melbourne in 1936. He led the club to their hat-trick of premierships in 1939, 1940 and 1941. La Fontaine went on to coach Melbourne from 1949 until 1951. In 1996 La Fontaine was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame.Hall of Fame – Players References Sources * * Second World War Nomonal Roll: Flying Officer Allan Faulkiner La Fontaine (119471).

It was built in the 1860s1 as a three-storey building possibly by the brewer Walkers of Warrington. A long bar ran the length of the pub curving at the end; two other rooms had no bar and were served by waiter service, which disappeared towards the end of the pub's life. The name of the pub probably refers to the fact that Toxteth was a Royal Park - although in the interwar years the name changed to the Admiral Hotel.2 In the 1871 England Census, it is recorded as being at 2 Admiral Street, Toxteth Park and in Ordnance Survey maps of the period it is marked as a PH on the corner of Admiral Street and North Hill Street - with a Freemasons' hall adjacent to it at 80 North Hill Street. However, in some Censuses the hotel is recorded as being at 84 North Hill Street. A history of the Ancient Briton Lodge records that \\"some time prior to 1877 a hotel had been built on the corner of Admiral Street and North Hill Street called the Masonic Arms\\" - although no other record of that name has yet been found.  Walker's Warrington Ales  The census records show that the pub was managed but there is no indication who the owners were; however the photograph from the 1920s shows that the pub was selling Walker's Warrington Ales - beers brewed by Peter Walker & Sons. Currently it is unknown whether they were the original owners. EDIT: The Original owners of The Royal Park Hotel, was Robert Cain & Sons, who sold the brewery to Peter Walker & Son in 1921, to become Walker Cain Ltd : 1921  Landlords  John Roberts is recorded as the Licensed Victualer - along with his wife Harriet - in 1871. Emily Marshall is noted as a Boarder indicating that rooms were indeed used for boarding. Elizabeth Davies is recorded as the Barmaid, and there are two servants: one had the task of being the billiard marker indicating that this was a pub activity at the time - a billiard marker kept the players' scores and chalked them on a scoring board. His duties could also include allocating tables, cues, chalk, and dealing with refreshments. In Toxeth Park Cemetery there is one monumental inscription that mentions the Royal Park Hotel: \\"In loving memory of John ROBERTS, of Marford Hill Gresford and formerly of the Royal Park Hotel in this city who died 21st August 1881, aged 51 years. Also of Harriet, wife of the above who died 7th May 1886, aged 70 years.\\"3 Roberts was born in Flintshire, North Wales and his arrival in Liverpool was no doubt part of the mass movement of people from rural Wales to the greater prosperity in Liverpool. So huge was the influx into Liverpool that Welsh, Scottish and Irish immigrants accounted for over 30% of Liverpool's population by the mid 19th century. Liverpool had become a significant port, the \\"Gateway to the Atlantic\\" and was a commercial centre second only to London. The allure of continued employment in the docks, in shipping and allied industries was overwhelming. From the mid to the end of the 19th century, Liverpool’s population more than doubled from just under 300,000 to over 700,00. At this time there were over 50,000 Welsh people living in the city and it was known as the Capital of North Wales. Toxteth was one of the districts they settled and to accommodate this influx of people rows of terraced houses were quickly built that subsequently became known as the Welsh Streets. One reference claims that in Toxteth, from 1831 to 1877, the local population had grown from 24,000 to 117,000. In the 1891 Census, Robert Fishlock had yet to work at the Royal Park but he was recorded as living on the Scotland Road with his occupation as Public House Manager. He had been born in Brentford, Middlesex. By 1894 (see below) he had moved to the Royal Park. Richard Burnett is recorded as the 'Public House Manager' in the 1901 Census. Aged 28, he had been born in Liverpool and was living at the Royal Park with his wife and two children. (NB: in this Census, the address is 84 North Park Street.) The 1911 Census has Joseph Pantoll aged 57 as the Brewery's Manager at the Royal Park. He was ex-Navy and had been born in Plymouth. His address is given as 84 North Park Street rather than Admiral Street but he also records two people resident at 2 Admiral Street: Ann Cameron, an 83-year-old widow and her granddaughter Margaret Cameron whose occupation is noted as a restaurant waitress. Perhaps she was working as a waitress at the Royal Park. Another 'Welsh' landlord was Henry Thomas. His family too had come from North Wales, moving to Liverpool in the 1830s. He was born just a few streets away in Wynnstay Street in 1891. Before the First World War he had been a mariner and had ended up in New Zealand. At the start of the War he joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, fought in Egypt, Gallipoli and France before returning to Liverpool in 1920 to take over the running of what had now been renamed as the Admiral Hotel. Here he lived with his family: wife Dorothy and two sons, Roy and Paul Thomas. The pub's name varied over the years (licensee in brackets)4: *1871: Royal Park Hotel (John Roberts) *1881: Royal Park Hotel (Mrs Mary Webster) *1894: Royal Park Hotel (Robert Fishlock) *1911: Royal Park Hotel (Joseph Pantoll) *1926: The Admiral Hotel (Henry Thomas) *1927: The Admiral Hotel (John Hughes) *1934: The Admiral Hotel (Wm Henry Taylor) *1938: The Royal Park Hotel (Wm Henry Taylor) *1941 Royal Park Hotel (Cyril Burns) *1946: The Royal Park Hotel (Cyril Burns) *1955: Royal Park Hotel (Edward John Cook) *1966: Royal Park Hotel (but no landlord noted)  Demolition  It is thought that it was during the mid 1970s that the pub was demolished, along with all the properties on the block including the adjacent Toxteth Masonic Hall, leaving an open space that was originally tarmac and part of a school. The school was demolished and the space was converted to football pitches in 2004 but then became derelict by 2010. In 2012 they were renovated and reopened as the Admiral Park Recreation Ground5.

It largely adopts the views in Gillick v West Norfolk Area Health Authority, a decision of the House of Lords in England and Wales.. Background \\"Marion\\", a pseudonym for the 14-year-old girl at the centre of this case, suffered from intellectual disabilities, severe deafness, epilepsy and other disorders. Her parents, a married couple from the Northern Territory sought an order from the Family Court of Australia authorising them to have Marion undergo a hysterectomy and an oophrectomy (removal of ovaries). The practical effect would be sterilisation and preventing Marion from being able to have children and many of the hormonal effects of adulthood. Under the Family Law Act the primary concern for matters involving children is that the court must act in the child's best interests. The majority of the High Court made it clear that it was merely deciding a point of law and that the decision about what was in the child's \\"best interests\\" would be left to the Family Court of Australia after the case. The main legal debate that arose was who has the legal authority to authorise the operation. Three options existed: the parents (as legal guardians of their daughter), Marion or an order of a competent court, such as the Family Court of Australia. The Full Court of the Family Court was asked to decide: > 1.Could the parents, as joint guardians authorize the sterilization > procedure; > 2.If not, does the Family Court have jurisdiction to: > (a)authorize the carrying out of such a procedure; > (b)enlarge the powers, rights or duties of the parents to enable them to > authorize such a procedure; or > (c)approve the consent of the Applicants, as to the proposed procedure. The majority of the Family Court, Strauss and McCall JJ held that the parents, as joint guardians could authorize the sterilization procedure. Nicholson CJ held that the Family Court had jurisdiction to authorize the procedure.Re Marion (No 2) (1992) 17 Fam LR 336. The Department, together with the Attorney-General for Australia, argued that only a court could authorize such a major operation and that the Family Court jurisdiction included any matter relating to the welfare of a child even if it was not a dispute about custody, guardianship or access. The parents, however, \\"argued that the decision to sterilise a child is not significantly different from other major decisions that parents and guardians have to make for children and that the involvement of the Family Court is optional and only of a 'supervisory nature'. Their argument was that, provided such a procedure is in the best interests of the child, parents as guardians can give lawful consent to a sterilisation on behalf of a mentally incompetent child.\\" Judgment The High Court recognised the right of everyone to bodily integrity under national and international law, and made a distinction between therapeutic and non- therapeutic surgical procedures as well as the duty of surrogates to act in the best interests of the incompetent patient. In the case, the High Court ruled that while parents may consent to medical treatment for their children, the authority does not extend to treatment not in the child's best interests. Also, the Court held that if medical treatment has sterilisation as its principal objective, parents do not have the authority to consent on behalf of their child. Obiter dictum The statement by Deane J that parents may grant surrogate consent for the non-therapeutic circumcision of male children is obiter dictum and not part of the judgment. Male circumcision was not at issue in the case and no evidence or testimony was offered regarding male circumcision. See also * E. (Mrs.) v.

Geography (കാര്യവട്ടം) is approximately 14 km north of Thiruvananthapuram on NH 47, between Pangappara (പാങ്ങപ്പാറ) and Kazhakuttam (കഴക്കൂട്ടം). It is about 3 km from Sreekariyam (ശ്രീകാര്യം) and 3.5 km from Kaniyapuram (കണിയാപുരം). According to old timers, the place got its name because the Ettuveettil Pillamar (എട്ടുവീട്ടീല്‍ പിള്ളമാര്‍) (Pillais from the 8 houses) who rebelled against the would-be Prince Marthandavarma (മാര്‍ത്താണ്ഡവര്‍മ്മ)(later King of Travancore) used to meet in a place near the Lord Ayyappa temple located near Kariavattom. It is believed that they used to sit in a circle and discuss matters of importance and hence the name Kariavattom. (Karya means matter and vattom means circle.) The above place name argument is simply unscientific (just think of Kuthiravttom and Aanathalavattom). The Karyam in Karyavattom is attached to Karyakkar of Kazhakkoottam temple.

It is also classed as an entry inhibitor. It also appeared to reduce graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia, in a Phase I/II study. Medical uses Two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, compared 209 people receiving optimized therapy plus a placebo to 426 people receiving optimized therapy plus 150 mg maraviroc once daily and 414 patients receiving optimized therapy plus 150 mg maraviroc twice daily. At 48 weeks, 55% of participants receiving maraviroc once daily and 60% of participants receiving the drug twice daily achieved a viral load of less than 400 copies/mL compared with 26% of those taking placebo; about 44% of the once-daily and 45% of the twice-daily maraviroc group had a viral load of less than 50 copies/mL compared with about 23% of those who received placebo. In addition, those who received the entry inhibitor had a mean increase in CD4+ cells of 110 cells/μL in the once-daily group, 106 cells/μL in the twice-daily group, and 56 cells/μL in the placebo group. Side effects Maraviroc can cause serious, life-threatening side effects. These include liver problems, skin reactions, and allergic reactions. An allergic reaction may happen before liver problems occur. Official labeling of Selzentry has black box warning for hepatotoxicity. The MOTIVATE trials showed no clinically relevant differences in safety between the maraviroc and placebo groups. Mechanism of action Maraviroc is an entry inhibitor. Specifically, maraviroc is a negative allosteric modulator of the CCR5 receptor, which is found on the surface of certain human cells. The chemokine receptor CCR5 is an essential co-receptor for most HIV strains and necessary for the entry process of the virus into the host cell. The drug binds to CCR5, thereby blocking the HIV protein gp120 from associating with the receptor. HIV is then unable to enter human macrophages and T cells. Because HIV can also use other coreceptors, such as CXCR4, an HIV tropism test such as a trofile assay must be performed to determine if the drug will be effective. History Maraviroc, originally designated UK-427857, was developed by the drug company Pfizer in its UK labs located in Sandwich. On April 24, 2007 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel reviewing maraviroc's New Drug Application unanimously recommended approval for the new drug,Gay News From 365Gay.com and the drug received full FDA approval on August 6, 2007 for use in treatment experienced patients. Maraviroc was approved for medical use in the European Union in September 2007. Names Maraviroc is the International nonproprietary name (INN).

Shox features 24 licensed vehicles from real-life makers like Audi, BMW, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Lancia, and Ford. The game introduced a unique concept, “Shox Zones.” Within each track there are specially designated areas, or \\"Shox Zones\\" where players are awarded Bronze, Silver, and Gold placements based on their driving skills. While Shox garnered praise upon release for its visuals, fun gameplay and sense of speed, it did not leave a lasting impact on the genre in the long run. Gameplay Shox: Rally Reinvented features three environments where all tracks are based upon: Arid (a desertlike, sandy environment), Jungle (a jungle-themed, muddy environment), and Ice (an arctic, snowy and icy environment). In every track there are three \\"Shox Zones\\", areas the player must cross while being timed. When the player reaches the end of a Shox Zone, the player is rewarded with cash based on the time taken to cross it, divided into Gold, Silver and Bronze. However, if the player takes too long to cross the zone, beyond the Bronze time, a reward will not be given. Shox doesn't feature the genre's traditional gameplay modes. Instead of time trial, single race, and career modes, Shox has only one: the championship mode where players take one of 24 cars through 30 different races that are spread across five unique leagues. Shox features licensed rally cars, ranging from the Subaru Impreza, Porsche Cayenne and Mitsubishi Lancer, which all feature visual damage and dirt from the tracks. The handling is very arcade oriented. Winning races earns money, which pays for car repairs or new cars. Multiplayer can be played with up to four-player splitscreen, either with races or capture the flag modes. There is also an option to split each controller so four players can be played with only two controllers. Shox also features the concept of a \\"Shox Wave\\", a sort of shockwave that follows the track ahead of the player's car if they successfully pass, within Gold time, through all three Shoxzones, and is activated on the next 'checkpoint' (for lack of a better word) (it is not required to achieve Gold time in each Shox Zone within a single lap). During the duration of its presence, the player continually earns cash, but the Shox Zone system is temporarily disabled. The objective of the Shox Wave, should it be activated, is to drive fast enough to catch up to it before it reaches the next checkpoint. While approaching the Shox Wave, the screen will appear increasingly blurry and distorted and make driving at high speed more difficult. Should the player fail to catch up in time, the Shox Wave will disappear and the Shox Zone system will resume. On the other hand, if the player succeeds, the Shox Wave will speed ahead of the player upon passing the checkpoint, for the player to catch up to again. Development Electronic Arts announced that an off-road rally car racer was in development for the PlayStation 2 at E3 2002. The game was developed by EA UK studio. Development reportedly took only eight months as the GameCube version was eventually scrapped in favor of a holiday season release. The game used the game engine from F1 2002. Described as a cross between Rally Cross and Ridge Racer, Shox is part of the EA Sports BIG lineup, which targeted casual gamers with slick presentation and over-the-top arcade-style gameplay. In Japan, the game was released under the name and was released on January 9, 2003. This version was published under the EA Games label instead of the EA Sports BIG label. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Famitsu gave it a score of 30 out of 40.

The Indo- Pacific Regional Dialogue,the apex level conference of the Indian Navy, is organised by the National Maritime Foundation as the Navy’s Knowledge Partner. Vision Statement To be the foremost resource centre for the development and advocacy of strategies for the promotion and protection of India’s maritime interests. Origin It was established under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860, inaugurated by the then Defence Minister of India, Mr Pranab Mukherjee in February 2005 in New Delhi. The genesis of the NMF lies in a long-felt need to redress India’s historical neglect of its maritime domain and to fill an acute intellectual void, by providing a common platform for discourse between maritime related institutions, organisations and disciplines, country-wide. It was also envisaged that the Foundation would provide an open forum for professional debate amongst the various stakeholders within India’s maritime domain, while serving to heighten maritime awareness amongst India’s policy-makers and intellectual elite, as also civil society at large. Activities As the first think tank in India which is solely focused on matters maritime, National Maritime Foundation conducts research, advocacy and convening activities to support this objective. =Research= The National Maritime Foundation consists of both active defence services researchers as well as civilian researchers focusing on various aspects of the maritime domain. The research areas include Maritime heritage, Maritime law, Maritime security, Maritime energy, Maritime technology, Maritime Trade and Connectivity, Climate Change and Sustainable Development, Blue Economy. NMF regularly publishes books, newsletters, commentaries and issue briefs targeted at decision makers in policy, government, business, and academia. NMF also publishes the maritime journal called Maritime Affair published by Taylor and Francis =Convening= It organises and facilitates study courses, conferences, seminars, lectures and research, in matters relating to relevant aspects of global maritime affairs and offer fellowships, prizes, scholarships and stipends in furtherance of the objectives of the Foundation. Indo Pacific Regional Dialogue The idea of an Indo-Pacific Regional Dialogue (IPRD) was first conceptualised and conducted in 2018, as the apex level conference of the Indian Navy, organised by the National Maritime Foundation as the Navy’s Knowledge Partner.

Sindhis were the first to arrive in Nigeria in the early part of the nineteenth century. Initially, they were primarily engaged in trading but gradually, while retaining their interest in trading, they ventured into other fields such as manufacturing and professional services. In succeeding decades, they made substantial investments, aggregating more than US$4 billion. Sindhi names like Chellaram, Bhojson, Chandrai etc are well known in Nigeria. Indian Sindhis run Superstores and are in the textiles sector, as well as in pharmaceuticals, fishing and engineering industries. Hindus of Indian origin  India and Nigeria were both part of the British Empire. Indians were brought to Africa by the British to build the rail network in Africa. However, most of the Indian population, along with other foreigners from across the Empire, fled to either the United Kingdom, the United States, or back to their country of origin during the Nigerian Civil War. With a fast rising and booming economy that ranks the fifth largest in the world today India has invested over USD 15 billion in Nigeria. There are over 85 well known Indian firms that have set up business in Nigeria creating jobs and opportunities for Nigerians. According to the High Commission of India in Abuja there are an estimated 35,000 Indians in Nigeria. Starting from the 1970s, the Nigerian government and several private firms began to hire Indian doctors, teachers, engineers and other professionals. Towards the end of the 1980s, many of the Indian experts returned to India when, with the substantial reduction in the country’s oil revenues, the country began to face severe economic problems, unemployment and poverty. The Government of Nigeria follows a liberal and non-discriminatory policy in the granting of citizenship to resident foreign nationals. As many as 8,000 Nigerians of Indian origin live in the country. Altogether, including Nigerians of Indian origin and expatriates, 25,000 Hindus live in Nigeria.

The men's 1st XV currently plays in London 3 South West - a league at level 8 of the English rugby union system - following their promotion from Hampshire Premier at the end of the 2018-19 season, while the 2nd XV play in Hampshire 2. History The club was formed in March 1948, with two matches being played during that season, and a full fixture list for two fifteens the following season. In the early days matches were played on Basingstoke Common and later at Whiteditch Field and several other grounds within the locality. A number of local hostelries provided the headquarters until 1958 when the Cricket Pavilion at Mays Bounty became the Club’s home until the move to Down Grange in 1971. The growth of the town resulted in a steady increase in Club strength, and there were three sides in 1963, four in 1966, five in 1970, and an occasional seventh team in 1971. During the seventies the Club was one of the strongest in the County. Playing strength declined for a while in the early eighties, but the wise investments in a strong junior and youth section paid dividends. The advent of the knock-out competitions and leagues was welcomed at Basingstoke. The Club has won the Hampshire Cup ten times and runners-up four times. In 1993 and 1994 Basingstoke RFC reached the fourth round of the Pilkington Cup, losing to Harlequins and London Irish RFC respectively. When league rugby started in 1987/88 the Club was entered into London Division 2 which they won that year, and the following year headed London Division 1, being promoted to National League 4 South (later to become League 5 South), in which they were runners-up two years running. A rather mixed performance in 1994/95 resulted in relegation to London Division 1. In 2008 the club was relegated to the London 2 South division. On two occasions Basingstoke's Sevens team has reached Twickenham and performed valiantly against first class opposition. On the second occasion they reached the final of the plate competition. The club and all the teams are fully supported by Bizz Radio Basingstoke, the local radio station in Basingstoke. Ground The ground fund account was opened at the AGM in 1961 with a sum of £20 which was all the Club could afford. During the late sixties fund raising and negotiations with Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council proceeded slowly. Eventually a ground lease was arranged at Down Grange. Building started in September 1970 and the Clubhouse was opened in January 1971. Once the project became a reality, fund raising improved dramatically, in addition a grant was obtained, and also a loan from the brewery. Two years later in 1973 two more changing rooms, a referees dressing room, a store and the spectator stand to the 1st XV pitch were added, together with other improvements largely to cope with the increasing number of players and supporters. In 1984 the President’s Lounge was built which provided comfortably accommodation for members and their families. The Club was still run entirely on a voluntary basis by members, however, in December 1988 in order to make greater use of the facilities and provide a better service for members, a full-time steward was employed and has been ever since. One more major development took place in 1991, when extensions to provide a dining area, larger kitchen, office, shop and weight training room were built. Internal improvements also included a fully equipped medical room, a new central heating system and enlargement of the bar area. The current capacity at Down Grange is around 2,500 overall including 250 seats.

The breed is also sometimes referred to as the North Devon to avoid confusion with the more recently developed South Devon cattle breed which is yellowish brown. Origin of the breed The native home of the Devon is in southwest England, primarily in the counties of Devon, Somerset, Cornwall and Dorset. The Devon is one of several modern breeds derived from the traditional red cattle of southern England, together with the Hereford, Sussex, Lincoln Red and Red Poll. The early improvers of the Devon breed were Francis Quartly of Great Champson, Molland, North Devon, and his elder brothers Rev. William (of West Molland Barton) and Henry (d. 1840), the eldest, who took over William's herd and lease in 1816. Francis had been left the lease of Champson with its herd by his father James (d. 1793) and commenced his work in improving the breed the year after his father's death. At that time during the Napoleonic Wars most of the farmers of Devon were taking advantage of the high prices offered by butchers for cattle, and the best bloodlines of the old herds were almost lost. Francis Quartly had the foresight to refuse to sell his best specimens and furthermore determined on the risky and expensive strategy of outbidding the butchers to acquire for himself what he judged to be the best representatives of the remnant of the old breed. Thus was founded the Champson herd. Francis and William died unmarried but Henry's eldest son James succeeded him at West Molland and his youngest son John succeeded his uncle Francis at Champson. Both became highly distinguished breeders of Devons.Thornton, p. 24 Also instrumental in the founding of the new breed were John Tanner Davy (d. 1852) of nearby Rose Ash and his brother William (d.1840), of Flitton Barton.Thornton, p. 25 Colonel John Tanner Davy, son of John Tanner Davy, founded the Devon herdbook in 1850. In 1884, the Devon Cattle Breeders' Society was founded and took over the herdbook. Today the Dart family of Great Champson, Molland, long established in that parish, continues to breed the descendants of the Quartly herd in their original home. The herd was founded by George Dart in 1947 with animals purchased from the Molland herd, and is carried on today by the brothers William and Henry Dart.Thornton, p. 198 =In the United States= In 1623 the ship Charity brought a consignment of red cattle (one bull and three heifers) from Devon to Edward Winslow, the agent for Plymouth Colony – these may have been of North Devon type. Although the Devon was originally a horned breed, American stockmen have developed a polled strain of purebred Devons. It traces back to the bull Missouri 9097, a hornless individual born in 1915 in the Devon herd owned by Case and Elling in Concordia, Missouri. The Devon was previously classified as a dual-purpose breed, (dairy and beef). Over the past half century, however, the breed has developed as a beef-type breed. The rate of maturity has been accelerated, and a common criticism of light hindquarters and sickle hocks have been reduced to a minimum. Devons have become longer, taller, and trimmer, but not to such extremes as in some other breeds. The traditional multi-purpose animals still exist in the United States and are now known as the American Milking Devon, though they are very rare. They are registered with the American Milking Devon Cattle Association.American Livestock Breeds Conservancy page on the Milking Devon Devon bullock team, Timbertown, Wauchope, New South Wales =In Australia= Devons were popular for use in bullock teams for hauling cedar and other logs from the forests, which was pit sawn and then transported by bullock drawn wagons and timber junkers to towns and seaports for cabinet making or export. These cattle were among the earliest breeds in Australia and Devons were noted for their docility, early maturing, hardiness and strength which were important attributes to have in a team.ABC Rural Characteristics of the modern breed Devon cattle are red in colour, varying in shade from a rich deep red to a light red or chestnut colour. A bright ruby red colour is preferred and accounts for their nickname, the \\"Red Ruby\\". The hair is of medium thickness and is often long and curly during the winter, but short and sleek in summer. The switch of the tail is creamy white. Mature bulls in good working condition weigh from to about . Mature cows range in weight from about to about . Thus, Devons have enough size to be practical and profitable without the handicap of excessive maintenance cost. Calving problems are seldom encountered although a growing stress on using larger bulls has increased the incidence of difficult births. The functional characteristics of the Devon make them a valuable genetic tool for the commercial beef industry. The breed has long been noted for its fertility, ease of calving, docility, hardiness and ability to adapt to temperature extremes. Devons are active good \\"walkers\\" and are excellent foragers. Their ability to utilize grass and other forages efficiently has heightened their popularity in areas such as southern Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand. In recent years however, the breed has fallen out of favour, as more rapidly growing continental breeds were in demand by both the farmer and butcher because of their speed of maturity and the quantity of higher-value cuts they produce. However, that meat has always been of a lower-eating quality than that of the slower-maturing grass-fed traditional breeds.

Notable among these are the American-influenced Union Bank building at 110–20 St Vincent Street; his 1901–1905 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station;Paton (2006) \\"Design worthy of the city\\". Chapter 4 In: Cameron (2006). and Wemyss Bay railway station on the Firth of Clyde.Walker (1986), p 146. His lengthy career resulted in a wide range of building types, and, with the assistance of skilled draughtsmen such as Richard M Gunn, he adapted his designs to changing tastes and new architectural materials and technologies. Miller moved to Stirling in 1911, at 'Randolphfield', and died there on 28 November 1947.  Early life  James Miller was the son of a farmer, and was born in Auchtergaven, Perthshire, in 1860.Sloan & Murray (1993), Introduction. He spent most of his childhood in Little Cairnie, Forteviot, and was educated at Perth Academy.Dictionary of Scottish Architects – James Miller In 1877 he was articled to the Perth architect Andrew Heiton, and on completion of his apprenticeship, he worked in Edinburgh at the office of Hippolyte Blanc before joining the engineering department of the Caledonian Railway, initially in Perth.  Career  Glasgow Royal Infirmary 1905-1915. In George Square, the McLaren warehouse (1922) and Olympic House (1903) frame an earlier office by James Burnett In 1888, Miller was transferred to the Caledonian Railway's drawing office in Glasgow, and designed a number of railway stations in the West of Scotland under the supervision of the engineer-in-chief, George Graham, and Donald Alexander Matheson, who was to become his successor. Notable designs from this period include the English-domestic style stations at Fort Matilda (1889), Troon (1892) and West Kilbride (1900), and the interchanges between rail and steamer at Gourock Pier (1889) and Greenock Princes Pier (1893). In 1892, having won the competition to design Belmont Church in Hillhead, he set up in full-time practice on his own account and rented an office at 223 West George Street, Glasgow. He continued to design for the Caledonian and other Scottish railway companies, including the distinctive 'chalet style' stations on the West Highland Railway in 1894, and the Scottish Jacobean-style St Enoch subway station for the Glasgow District Subway Company. During the following 40 years, he won competitions and commissions for a wide variety of buildings including for the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition, of which his Sunlight Cottages are the sole remains; in 1901 for the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, which resulted in a bulky and unpopular baronial-style design; and in 1904 for the Glasgow & South Western Railway's Turnberry Hotel. He undertook significant work for the Caledonian Railway at this time, including extensions to Glasgow Central Station and its hotel (1900–1905), Wemyss Bay railway station (1903), with its circular booking office and curving timber walkway to the steamer pier, and Stirling railway station (1915), also with circular elements. He designed the Govan memorial church to Margaret Macgregor. In 1910 he won the competition to design the headquarters of the Institution of Civil Engineers at One Great George Street in London's Westminster, together with the adjacent matching extension to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, which were built of Portland stone in a neo-Baroque style. An American influence began to appear in Miller's work following a 1902 fact-finding visit to the USA by Matheson. An early example was Olympic House (1903), a plain rectangular speculative office development in Glasgow's Queen Street, followed by the Anchor Line Building (1905–07) on St Vincent Place. The façade of this building is of white faience tiles, the first time that a Scottish architect had used this material. It developed further following the appointment in 1918 of Richard M Gunn as chief draughtsman and designer, which resulted in designs such as the McLaren warehouse (1922) in George Square, and the massive classical Head Office for the Union Bank of Scotland (1924) in St Vincent Street. Miller's later commercial architecture during the 1930s featured hints of Egyptian revival decoration and Art Deco, as seen in the Commercial Bank of Scotland (1930–1) at the corner of Glasgow's West Nile and West George streets; and the last of his bank buildings, also for the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at 30 Bothwell Street (1934–35). Both these buildings used white Portland Stone to combat the effects of Glasgow's polluted atmosphere at the time. Major commissions beyond Scotland included Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys (1927) in Leicester, and the neo-Georgian style Dining Hall and 'Cocoa Block' (1929) for Cadbury at Bournville. His final designs were for long, low buildings such as the Glasgow & West of Scotland College of Commerce (1933) in Pitt Street, Glasgow. Miller's domestic work spanned his architectural career. Much of his early work, such as 'Dunloskin', Dumbreck (1890), and Craighuchty Terrace, Aberfoyle (c.1890) is in an English Arts & Crafts style and influenced by his railway architecture. Further commissions for houses in Glasgow followed as a result of Miller's involvement in the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition, including 8 and 10 Lowther Terrace, Great Western Road (1904 and 1910 respectively). Between 1915 and 1923, he designed 'Kildonan', near Barrhill, Ayrshire, for Captain David Euan Wallace MP, a very large property similar in size to Turnberry Hotel, and in a Tudor Revival style. In 1937 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Magnus Mowat, Sir Thomas Hudson Beare, Sir Thomas Henry Holland, John Barber Todd and Sir Alexander Gibb. Miller died on 28 November 1947 at Randolphfield, Stirling, which had been his home since 1911. Family He had three children. Muriel (1901-1999) George (1903-1940) and Mabel (1904-2001) His son George joined the architectural practice in the mid-1930s but died in 1940, at which point James retired.

It abolished the role of the old Roman nobility at the papal court with the exception of the position of Prince Assistant to the Papal Throne. The titles abolished, such as the Grand Master of the Sacred Apostolic Hospice and Marshal of the Holy Roman Church and the Sacred Conclave, remain heredity but are now purely honorary. This position of Prince Assistant had been shared jointly by the Princes Orsini and Colonna, but the former was deprived of the title by Pope Pius XII after he obtained a divorce and the title was conferred upon Prince Torlonia, Prince of Fucino, Canino and Musignano of the Torlonia family. The Prince Assistants are representatives of the Roman nobility, who serve at the feet of the Throne immediately next to the cardinal deacon who stands to the right of the pope. They alternate in fulfilling the functions of the office and no one can substitute for them. Their principal function is to serve on the occasion of official visits by a head of state.

The store also sold DVDs, clothing and tickets to music and comedy events. Due to the history of the business, the large variety of music sold, and promotion of local acts, the store has had a significant influence upon local culture and the music scene within Perth \\\\- in particular chapter 2 Selling a Music Landscape (pp.29-42) by Debbie Hindley  History  78 Records first opened on 19 June 1971 on the first floor of the Padbury Building in Forrest Place. Geoff \\"Hud\\" Hudson, John Hood, and John \\"Scruff\\" McGregor started the store to provide music that was unavailable from other outlets. In its infancy, 78 Records boasted about 300 titles, all on vinyl and mainly imports, with a strong leaning towards blues but also encompassing an extensive range of other genres, though space was constrained as the store was housed in two small rooms. It was the three owners' love of the blues that inspired the store's logo, with its photographic representation of Blind Lemon Jefferson. The name 78 Records derives from the format on which his original recordings were released.78 Records Australia http://www.78records.com.au 78 Records steadily expanded by providing customers with music that was hard to come by in the early 1970s, such as Rolling Stones Sticky Fingers, Jethro Tull's Aqualung and Neil Young's Harvest. In 1973, rumours started regarding the proposed demolition of the Padbury Buildings, which eventuated with the construction of Forrest Chase in the re-designed Forrest Place during the late 1980s. In May 1974, 78 Records moved into what was essentially a tin shed next door to His Majesty's Theatre, Western Australia at 843 Hay Street, which has become affectionately known as \\"the old building\\". The increase in floor size enabled 78 Records to add a lounge area where customers could lounge in beanbags and listen to the music prior to making their purchases, the first such facility in Perth. 78 Records expanded its available music and started its tradition of an in-house band, the West Australian Chainsaw Orchestra, theme days and the selection of the instrumental \\"A Walk in the Black Forest\\" by Horst Jankowski at closing time. During the 843 era, 78 Records also earned a reputation which travelled much further afield than the metropolitan area, and visiting international performers frequented the shop in search of that elusive record they couldn't find anywhere else. Of course, some of them just wanted to check out how many of their own albums were in stock. Joe Cocker, Van Morrison, Elvis Costello, Bette Midler, Lou Reed and Elton John were just some of the artists that came back on their next visit. 843 Hay Street was proposed for demolition in 1987. Wanting to stay in the same area they had become associated with, 78 Records crossed Hay Street to number 884. In 1989, the Basement opened with videos, books, posters, comics T-shirts, and tickets for forthcoming events. 78 Records expanded from solely music-related items with the Basement developing a unique identity of its own with the inclusion of film, interactive media and cult writing. 78 Records moved again in March 1996 to 914 Hay Street, where it was located for 16 years. The first floor of this larger building had its own stage which was frequently used by local, national and international artists. In 2013 the store relocated once again to upstairs premises above 255 Murray Street with entry from a laneway off the Murray Street Mall. Entrance in 2017 On 5 February 2019 the manager of 78 Records announced that the store would be closing on 3 March 2019 after nearly 48 years of operation, citing the rise of streaming services and declining retail conditions as the reason for the closure.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-05/78-records-store-closes-blames- spotify-retail-downturn/10781084 Awards 78 Records won the ARIA Award for Best Independent Retail Outlet in Western Australia in 2007.

The group has also been treated as the class Pteridopsida or Polypodiopsida, although other classifications assign them a different rank. Older names for the group include Filicidae and Filicales, although at least the \\"water ferns\\" (now the Salviniales) were then treated separately. The leptosporangiate ferns are one of the four major groups of ferns, with the other three being the eusporangiate ferns comprising the marattioid ferns (Marattiidae, Marattiaceae), the horsetails (Equisetiidae, Equisetaceae), and whisk ferns and moonworts. There are approximately 8465 species of living leptosporangiate ferns, compared with about 2070 for all other ferns, totalling 10535 species of ferns. Almost a third of leptosporangiate fern species are epiphytes. These ferns are called leptosporangiate because their sporangia arise from a single epidermal cell and not from a group of cells as in eusporangiate ferns (a polyphyletic lineage). The sporangia are typically covered with a scale called the indusium, which can cover the whole sorus, forming a ring or cup around the sorus, or can also be strongly reduced to completely absent. Many leptosporangiate ferns have an annulus around the sporangium, which ejects the spores. Taxonomy The leptosporangiate ferns were first recognized as a group, the \\"Leptosporangiateen\\", by Karl Ritter von Goebel in 1881, who placed the eusporangiate ferns with seed plants and vascular plants into a coeval \\"Eusporangiateen\\". As this classification artificially split the ferns, Christian Luerssen subdivided the homosporous ferns only into Eusporangiatae and Leptosporangiatae in 1884–9. The latter group was treated at a variety of ranks in subsequent systems of classification. The subclass \\"Polypodiidae\\" was first published and used for the homosporous leptosporangiate ferns by Cronquist, Takhtajan and Zimmermann in 1966, typified on Polypodium L.. Other contemporary classifications used the name \\"Filicidae\\" for this subclass. Smith et al. (2006) carried out the first higher-level classification of ferns based on molecular phylogenetics. They included heterosporous water ferns (Salviniales) (placed in a separate subclass by Cronquist et al. due to their highly modified morphology) within the leptosporangiate ferns, which they elevated to the rank of class as the Polypodiopsida (published by Cronquist et al. to include all ferns). The common ancestor of Salviniales, Cyatheales and Polypodiales went through a whole genome duplication. Later classifications renamed the group Polypodiidae, initially as a subclass of Equisetopsida sensu lato. This subclass comprises leptosporangiate ferns as opposed to the remaining three subclasses which are informally referred to as eusporangiate ferns. The following diagram shows a likely phylogenic relationship between subclass Polypodiidae and the other Equisetopsida subclasses in that system In 2014, Christenhusz and Chase grouped all the fern subclasses together as Polypodiophyta and in 2016 the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG) adopted the class Polypodiopsida sensu lato for the four fern subclasses. The following cladogram shows the phylogenic relationship between the subclasses according to the PPG. The first three small subclasses being informally grouped as eusporangiate ferns, in contrast to the Polypodiidae or leptosporangiate ferns. Polypodiidae is shown as a sister group of Marattiidae. = Subdivision = In both the Christenhusz and Chase, and the PPG classification, the extant Polypodiidae are divided into seven orders, 44 families, 300 genera, and an estimated 10,323 species. These seven orders are phylogenetically related as follows (Christenhusz and Chase 2014 in italics, where it differs): =Phylogenetic relationships= The following phylogram shows a likely relationship between the other vascular plant classes and the leptosporangiate ferns. It was formerly unclear about the relationship between Equisetopsida, Psilotopsida, and Marattiopsida, but recent studies have shown that Equisetopsida is most likely sister to Psilotopsida. Discussion of molecular classification There has been some challenge to recent molecular studies, claiming that these provide a skewed view of the phylogenetic order because they do not take into account fossil representatives. However, the molecular studies have clarified relations among families that had already been thought to be polyphyletic before the advent of molecular information but that were left in their polyphyletic ranks because there was not enough information to do otherwise.Kramer, K. U. (1990). Notes on the Higher Level Classification of the Recent Ferns. The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants: Pteridophytes and Gymnosperms. K. Kubitzki, K. U. Kramer and P. S. Green. New York, Springer-Verlag. 1: 49-52 The classification of ferns using these molecular studies, which have generally supported one another, reflects the best information available at present, because traditional morphological characters are not always informative in elucidating evolutionary relationships among ferns. Extinct families The leptosporangiate ferns have a substantial fossil record. For example, fossils assigned to the Dicksoniaceae, a member of the Cyatheales, are known from the Lower Jurassic (). A number of other extinct families have been described. They are not included in the classification systems used for extant ferns, and so most cannot be assigned to orders used in these systems. Taylor et al. (2009) use the order \\"Filicales\\", which corresponds to four Polypodiidae orders in more modern systems: Hymenophyllales, Gleicheniales, Schizaeales and Cyatheales. The unplaced families include: *Anachoropteridaceae *Botryopteridaceae *Kaplanopteridaceae *Psalixochlaenaceae *Sermayaceae *Skaaripteridaceae *Tedeleaceae *Tempskyaceae References  Bibliography    .

Once strictly a ceremonial art derived from , kagura has evolved in many directions over the span of more than a millennium. Today, it is very much a living tradition, with rituals tied to the rhythms of the agricultural calendar, thriving primarily in parts of Shimane prefecture, and urban centers such as Hiroshima.Petersen, David. (2007). Invitation to Kagura: Hidden Gem of the Traditional Japanese Performing Arts. Morrisville: Lulu Press. History The epics Kojiki and Nihon Shoki describe a folktale origin for the dances. In these texts, there is a famous legendary tale about the sun goddess Amaterasu, who retreated into a cave, bringing darkness and cold to the world. Ame-no-Uzume, goddess of the dawn and of revelry, led the other gods in a wild dance, and persuaded Amaterasu to emerge to see what the ruckus was all about.Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697, translated from the original Chinese and Japanese by William George Aston. Book I, part 1, page 44f. Tuttle Publishing. Tra edition (July 2005). First edition published 1972. Kagura is one of a number of rituals and arts said to derive from this event. Originally called , kagura began as sacred dances performed at the Imperial court by shrine maidens (miko) who were supposedly descendants of Ame-no-Uzume. Over time, however, these performed within the sacred and private precincts of the Imperial courts, inspired popular ritual dances, called , which, being popular forms, practiced in villages all around the country, were adapted into various other folk traditions and developed into a number of different forms. Among these are miko kagura, shishi kagura, and Ise-style and Izumo-style kagura dances. Many more variations have developed over the centuries, including some which are fairly new, and most of which have become highly secularized folk traditions. Kagura, in particular those forms that involve storytelling or reenactment of fables, is also one of the primary influences on the Noh theatre. Imperial Kagura The formal Imperial ritual dances (Mikagura) were performed in a number of sacred places and on a number of special occasions. At the Imperial Sanctuary, where the Sacred Mirror is kept, they are performed as part of gagaku court music. Mikagura are also performed at the Imperial harvest festival and at major shrines such as Ise, Kamo, and Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū. Since around the year 1000, these events have taken place every year. According to the ritual department of the Imperial Household Agency, mikagura still take place every December in the Imperial Sanctuary and at the Imperial harvest festival ceremonies. Folk Kagura Satokagura, or \\"normal kagura\\", is a wide umbrella term containing a great diversity of folk dances derived from the Imperial ritual dances (Mikagura), and incorporated with other folk traditions. For the sake of brevity, a selection of traditions from the Kantō region will be used as examples: *Miko kagura – dances performed by shrine maidens (miko) originally derived from ritual dances in which the miko channeled the kami, as part of imperial court dances. These originally had a very loose form, akin to similar god-possession dances and rituals, but over time they have developed, into highly regular set forms. Today, they are performed by shrines during the daijō-sai (大嘗祭) festival and in worship to kami as part of a matsuri. They are also performed at Buddhist temples as a martial arts performance. These dances are often performed with ritual props, such as bells, bamboo canes, sprigs of sakaki, or paper streamers. *Izumo-ryū kagura – Dances based on those performed at Izumo Shrine serve a number of purposes, including ritual purification, celebration of auspicious days, and the reenactment of folktales. Originally quite popular in the chūgoku region, near Izumo, these dances have spread across the country, and have developed over the centuries, becoming more of a secular folk entertainment and less of a formal religious ritual. Susanoo and Orochi in Izumo-ryū kagura *Yutate kagura – A form of dances where miko and priests dip bamboo leaves in hot water and splash the hot water on themselves by shaking the leaves, and then scattering the hot water to people around the area. *Shishi kagura – A form of lion dance, in which a group of dancers take on the role of the shishi lion and parade around the town. The lion mask and costume is seen as, in some ways, embodying the spirit of the lion, and this is a form of folk worship and ritual, as other forms of lion dances are in Japan and elsewhere. Miko kagura *Daikagura – A form of dance deriving from rituals performed by traveling priests between Ise Grand Shrine and Atsuta Shrine, who would travel to villages, crossroads, and other locations to help the locals by driving away evil spirits. Acrobatic feats and lion dances played a major role in these rituals. Around the time of the beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1868), performances derived from this emerged in Edo as a major form of entertainment. In connection with the celebrations surrounding the beginning of the shogunate, lion dances, acrobatics, juggling, and a great variety of other entertainments were performed on stages across the city, all nominally under the auspices of \\"daikagura\\". Over the course of the period, these came to be more closely associated with rakugo storytelling and other forms of popular entertainment, and still today, daikagura continues to be performed and include many elements of street entertainment.

Court Historiographer to King Frederick I of Prussia, he became a figure of ridicule in the \\"Tobacco Cabinet\\" (Tabakskollegium) of Frederick William I. Early life Gundling came from a Franconian family. His father Wolfgang Gundling, who died in 1689, was a pastor at St Sebold in Kirchensittenbach near Nuremberg. Shortly before his birth the family fled to Hersbruck from marauding imperial soldiers. From 1690 to 1693, Gundling attended the Pforta county school in Naumburg, later studying law and history at the universities of Altdorf, Helmstedt and Jena as well as Halle. In 1699 he accompanied the Nuremberg patrician Jacobus von Tetzell on his travels to Holland and England. King Frederick I of Prussia appointed him Professor of History and Law at the Berlin Knights' Academy in 1705, and as historian at the Chief Herald's Office in 1706.Clark, Christopher, Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600-1947, Penguin 2006 The Chief Herald's Office was responsible for verifying the genealogical credentials of nobles seeking public office. Gundling's position was, at first, an enviable one. Like many other foreign intellectuals he was attracted to Potsdam by Frederick I's lavish patronage and enlightenment ideas. He accompanied the king wherever he went, to supply him with erudite conversation, and was served food from his table.Littell, E, The Living Age, Second Series, Vol 2, p.648 Boston, New York & Philadelphia 1853 The king's dining room had had a sort of pulpit erected in it, from which Gundling, as royal newspaper reader, would expound on the topics in the news while the guests were eating.Littell, E, The Living Age, Second Series, Vol 2,p.648 Boston, New York & Philadelphia 1853 The Tobacco Cabinet After the death of the king in 1713, his son, the 'soldier king' Friedrich Wilhelm I dispensed with all of his father's cultured ways and abolished the Knights' Academy, but appointed Gundling to be his Councilor and historian. However his role at the Prussian court came more to resemble that of court jester, as he became the butt of many cruel taunts and practical jokes perpetrated by the King's rowdy and sometimes violent associates in the so-called 'Tobacco Cabinet'. Under the late King Frederick I, the Tobacco Cabinet had been a relaxed and informal social circle, including women, which ran on a convivial basis. His son Frederick William I maintained the institution, but fundamentally changed its character. It became an all-male society, whose members were mostly military men who gathered in sparsely-furnished rooms to smoke, hold discussions and drink to excess.The Cambridge Modern History, Volume 11, edited by Stanley Leathes, G. W. (George Walter) Prothero, Sir Adolphus William Ward, Cambridge University Press 1909 p.210 At sessions of the Tobacco Cabinet, court scholars would be brought in to give expert advice on some topic, and a discussion would follow. Often, the excessive alcohol consumption meant that these debates ended in physical fights for the amusement of College members. At these sessions Gundling was particularly singled out for humiliation.The Holy Roman Empire Reconsidered, edited by Jason Philip Coy, Benjamin Marschke, David Warren Sabean, Spektrum 2010 p.54 In February 1714, he was required to deliver a lecture to assembled guests offering arguments for and against the existence of ghosts, while being made to drink heavily. After his lecture he was escorted by two Grenadier Guards back to his room, where he screamed with terror at the sight of a figure moving around covered in a sheet.Clark, Christopher, Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600-1947, Penguin 2006 On another occasion, while he was drunk, his official Chamberlain's key was cut off his coat, and, in punishment for 'losing' it, he was made to wear a large wooden Chamberlain's key a yard long around his neck;Littell, E, The Living Age, Second Series, Vol 2, p. 649, Boston, New York & Philadelphia 1853 He was invited to dinner and conveyed in a sedan chair from which the bottom fell out while it was moving, forcing him to run to keep up with the bearers, who paid no heed to his cries. A monkey, dressed as Gundling, was introduced to him as his own son, and he was compelled to embrace and kiss it. One night, in the middle of winter, when he was making his way home over the castle drawbridge, he was seized by four burly Grenadier Guards and dropped repeatedly onto the frozen moat below until his weight broke the ice, and he was ridiculed from above as he struggled in agony. Then the king left two young bears in his bedroom to terrify him. He frequently returned home to find his doorway bricked up, and on occasion the quiet of his study was shattered with firecrackers.Littell, E, The Living Age, Second Series, Vol 2, p.649 Boston, New York & Philadelphia 1853 In 1716 Gundling sought to escape his misery by fleeing to his brother Nicholas Jerome Gundlingius, professor and scholar in Halle, but he was brought back. Unauthorized departure from court was considered to be desertion. Some three years after his attempted flight, Gundling underwent one of the cruellest jokes ever played on him. A man named David Fassman was his rival at court, and, after his death, was to take over many of his offices. Fassman had composed a vicious satire on Gundling, called 'The Learned Fool', which the king commanded him to present to the Tobacco Cabinet with Gundling present. Incensed by what he was hearing, Gundling seized a silver pan filled with charcoal which was used for lighting pipes, and flung it at Fassman's face, singeing his eyebrows and lashes. Fassman responded by using the same pan to beat Gundling very severely, and thereafter the two men repeatedly came to blows in the Tobacco Cabinet. Eventually the king commanded them to fight a duel. On the field, Gundling refused to fire and dropped his pistol, but Fassman shot at Gundling, though his pistol was only filled with powder. As a result, he managed to set Gundling's wig on fire, much to the amusement of the king's companions.Littell, E, The Living Age, Second Series, Vol 2, p.649, Boston, New York & Philadelphia 1853 Evidently because of these continued humiliations he developed stomach ulcers, the pain of which he sought to deaden by further alcohol consumption. A second flight led him to Catholic Breslau, where he was offered a post - on the condition that he convert to Catholicism. Gundling refused and returned to Prussia under pressure from the soldier king. On 3 January 1720 he married Anne de Larray, the daughter of an aristocratic Huguenot, who had fled from France to Berlin by way of Holland. Court society correctly believed that the decision to marry was a move on Gundling's part to escape the constraints of his existence as the king's learned fool, or at least to establish a second, domestic aspect to his life in distinction to it, and therefore did everything possible to prevent the project. Satirical drawings and notes about the bride and groom were circulated, and Gundling's food was to have been mixed with a strong laxative before the wedding night. Gundling managed to escape this and other attacks planned for the wedding day by reporting himself sick, and having the marriage take place secretly and earlier than planned. Later life Despite these continued torments Gundling enjoyed, in the formal sense at least, high standing in Prussian public life. The King entrusted him with a number of high state offices, appointed him to the position of President of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and on 25 September 1724 made him a baron. He had a substantial income, horses, carriages and servants, and was able, in most respects, to lead a privileged life. Gundling died on 11 April 1731 in Potsdam as a consequence of his ulcers. Even in death the king did not spare him humiliation. By royal command he had been compelled for a number of years to keep, in his bedroom, a coffin made from a varnished wine barrel, on which the following verse was written: ::Here there lies within his skin ::Half man, half pig, a wondrous thing ::Clever in his youth, in old age not so bright, ::Full of wit at morning, full of drink at night. ::Let the voice of Bacchus sing ::This, my child, is Gundeling ::[...] ::Reader, say can you divine ::Whether he was man or swine?Clark, Christopher, Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600-1947, Penguin 2006 After he died, the king had his body paraded through the streets of Potsdam and then publicly displayed, wearing the outlandish costume he required Gundling to wear for his own amusement, propped up in the barrel. Various ribald songs were composed specially for his funeral, but the king's antics were so outrageous that the local clergy categorically refused to have anything to do with this parody of a funeral ceremony.The Holy Roman Empire Reconsidered, edited by Jason Philip Coy, Benjamin Marschke, David Warren Sabean, Spektrum 2010 p.54 Instead, the funeral sermon was delivered by none other than Gundling's long-time tormentor, David Fassman.Littell, E, The Living Age, Second Series, Vol 2, p.649, Boston, New York & Philadelphia 1853 Work Under Gundling's Presidency of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the Collegium Medico- chirurgicum was founded. Gundling conducted a systematic evaluation of the sources of the humanities taught in Prussian institutions, and the establishment of the Prussian school system was a project led by him. He was also responsible for the comprehensive mapping of Prussia, and between 1713 and 1715 he traveled extensively throughout Brandenburg to obtain information for his Brandenburg Atlas, which he completed 1724.AF Büsching: Full topography of the Mark Brandenburg , 1775, pp. 6-7 (online) In addition, he wrote and published a number of historical and biographical texts and in-depth descriptions of the countryside of Brandenburg and Pomerania. His work on Albrecht the Bear, the first Margrave of Brandenburg, contains the first known mention of the story of how Albrecht converted the Slavic Prince Jaxa to Christianity. He was also regarded as a highly influential figure at the Berlin court, who had a major voice in both the internal and the external policy of Friedrich Wilhelm I. The Austrian envoy to the Potsdam court, Seckendorff, complained to Prince Eugene on 23 October 1726 that 'no-one did the Austrians more harm than a certain Privy Councillor, Gundling, who, much against his will, was forced to act the part of a merry-Andrew, but who was always in the king's company; that he was looked on as an oracle in publicis. Whenever Austrian affairs were being discussed, this man insinuated into the king's ear falsa principia; that he was worth winning by the present of a golden chain and a miniature of the Emperor.' Gundling was accordingly presented with a miniature set in diamonds.Littell, E, The Living Age, Second Series, Vol 2, p.648 Boston, New York & Philadelphia 1853 Assessment English sources have tended to emphasise Gundling's supposed character flaws and misfortunes at the expense of his learned achievements. German sources take a range of views. All are constrained by the fact that the main extant source of information about Gundling is a one-sided diatribe, published four years after his death, by his hated enemy Fassman. Until around the mid-18th Century there were fairly balanced judgments about Gundling. Goethe's great- uncle commented: \\"His published books, all of which are thoroughly written, are without much spirit. It seems therefore, as if the king wanted to make a learned man play-act to soldiers.\\".Martin Sabrow, Herr und Hanswurst; Das tragische Schicksal des Hofgelehrten Jacob Paul von Gundling. DVA Stuttgart München 2001, p.10 The \\"Nürnbergischen scholar-Lexicon\\" of 1755 states: \\"... but he was ridiculed all over the court. His contributions to scholarship nevertheless remain very great and his writings ... are held, without exception, to be thorough\\".Martin Sabrow, Herr und Hanswurst; Das tragische Schicksal des Hofgelehrten Jacob Paul von Gundling. DVA Stuttgart München 2001,p. 12 The more the Age of Enlightenment progressed, the less Gundling's work was held in esteem. By 1750 the Academy of Sciences was keen to distance themselves from their own inglorious history under the Soldier King, and stories about the arbitrary and vicious behaviour of their former President were not something they wished to preserve the memory of. In contrast a 1795 biography detailed the foolish, tragicomic adventures of Gundling, but his merits as a scholar hardly found mention.Martin Sabrow, Herr und Hanswurst; Das tragische Schicksal des Hofgelehrten Jacob Paul von Gundling. DVA Stuttgart München 2001,p. 13 This remained the standard approach until the mid-19th Century. After that, the view of Gundling changed again, in a double sense. On one hand, liberal historians re-evaluated the time before the Enlightenment: Gundling's scholarly qualifications were highlighted and the barren intellectual climate during the lifetime of the soldier king bemoaned.Martin Sabrow, Herr und Hanswurst; Das tragische Schicksal des Hofgelehrten Jacob Paul von Gundling. DVA Stuttgart München 2001, p.18 On the other hand, in the last third of the 19th century, Prussian historians tried to finesse away a view of history in which an ancestor of the ruling Hohenzollerns was responsible for the scandalous treatment of science in general and of Gundling in particular. In their version, the weak-minded court scholar basically had himself to blame for his own fate.Martin Sabrow, Herr und Hanswurst; Das tragische Schicksal des Hofgelehrten Jacob Paul von Gundling. DVA Stuttgart München 2001, p.18 Up to the present day there continue to be attempts of many different sorts to do justice to Gundling, some of which concentrate almost exclusively on his vanity, his drunkenness and the resulting \\"fun\\" while others take a sharply differentiated, source- critical view, which brings his significant scientific achievements into consideration.

Banna was born in Nazareth, where she graduated from Nazareth Baptist School. She lived in Nazareth with her three children. She met her husband, Ukrainian guitarist Leonid Alexeyenko, while studying music together at the Higher Music Conservatory in Moscow and they married in 2001, and got divorced in 2010. Artistic philosophy Banna first achieved popularity in the early 1990s, after recording her own versions of traditional Palestinian children's songs that were on the verge of being forgotten. Many such songs and rhymes sung by Palestinian families again today are said to be thanks to Banna's work in preserving them via her recordings. Rim Banna also composed her own songs and adds melody to Palestinian poetry. Her message was often focused on the suffering of Palestinians, particularly those West Bank. Her music is described as \\"haunting, emotional, at times bordering on kitsch.\\" She describes her music as a means of cultural self-assertion: > A part of our work consists of collecting traditional Palestinian texts > without melodies. So that the texts do not get lost, we try to compose > melodies for them that are modern, yet inspired by traditional Palestinian > music. In this way, Banna did more than mimic the traditional techniques and representations of the pieces she interprets.

Banna accepted the invitation, and the two artists did a show together. The album, dubbed \\"a musical antiwar message to U.S. President Bush from female singers in Palestine, Iraq, Iran, and Norway,\\" brings these women together with others from North Korea, Syria, Cuba, and Afghanistan, to sing traditional lullabies from their lands in duet form with English-language performers whose translation allows the songs to reach a Western audience. =Mirror of My Soul= The Mirrors of My Soul, which was dedicated to all the Palestinian and Arab political detainees in the Israeli prisons, is a stylistic departure from her previous body of work.

Today, most automated identification systems rely on images depicting the species for the identification. Based on precisely identified images of a species, a classifier is trained. Once exposed to a sufficient amount of training data, this classifier can then identify the trained species on previously unseen images. Accurate species identification is the basis for all aspects of taxonomic research and is an essential component of workflows in biological research.  Introduction  The automated identification of biological objects such as insects (individuals) and/or groups (e.g., species, guilds, characters) has been a dream among systematists for centuries. The goal of some of the first multivariate biometric methods was to address the perennial problem of group discrimination and inter-group characterization. Despite much preliminary work in the 1950s and '60s, progress in designing and implementing practical systems for fully automated object biological identification has proven frustratingly slow. As recently as 2004 Dan Janzen updated the dream for a new audience: > The spaceship lands. He steps out. He points it around. It says > ‘friendly–unfriendly—edible–poisonous—safe– dangerous—living–inanimate’. On > the next sweep it says ‘Quercus oleoides—Homo sapiens—Spondias > mombin—Solanum nigrum—Crotalus durissus—Morpho peleides—serpentine’. This > has been in my head since reading science fiction in ninth grade half a > century ago.  The species identification problem  Daisy system. The image is the wing of a biting midge Culicoides sp., some species of which are vectors of Bluetongue. Others may also be vectors of Schmallenberg virus an emerging disease of livestock, especially sheep. (Credit: Mark A. O'Neill) Janzen's preferred solution to this classic problem involved building machines to identify species from their DNA. His predicted budget and proposed research team is “US$1 million and five bright people.” However, recent developments in computer architectures, as well as innovations in software design, have placed the tools needed to realize Janzen's vision in the hands of the systematics and computer science community not in several years hence, but now; and not just for creating DNA barcodes, but also for identification based on digital images. A seminal survey published in 2004, studies why automated species identification had not become widely employed at this time and whether it would be a realistic option for the future. The authors found that \\"a small but growing number of studies sought to develop automated species identification systems based on morphological characters\\". An overview of 20 studies analyzing species’ structures, such as cells, pollen, wings, and genitalia, shows identification success rates between 40% and 100% on training sets with 1 to 72 species. However, they also identified four fundamental problems with these systems: (1) training sets—were too small (5-10 specimens per species) and their extension especially for rare species may be difficult, (2) errors in identification—are not sufficiently studied to handle them and to find systematics, (3) scaling—studies consider only small numbers of species (<200 species), and (4) novel species — systems are restricted to the species they have been trained for and will classify any novel observation as one of the known species. A survey published in 2017 systematically compares and discusses progress and findings towards automated plant species identification within the last decade (2005–2015). 120 primary studies have been published in high-quality venues within this time, mainly by authors with computer science background. These studies propose a wealth of computer vision approaches, i.e., features reducing the high-dimensionality of the pixel-based image data while preserving the characteristic information as well as classification methods. The vast majority of these studies analyzes leaves for identification, while only 13 studies propose methods for flower-based identification. The reasons being that leaves can easier be collected and imaged and are available for most of the year. Proposed features capture generic object characteristic, i.e., shape, texture, and color as well as leaf-specific characteristics, i.e., venation and margin. The majority of studies still used datasets for evaluation that contained no more than 250 species. However, there is progress in this regard, one study uses a dataset with >2k and another with >20k species. These developments could not have come at a better time. As the taxonomic community already knows, the world is running out of specialists who can identify the very biodiversity whose preservation has become a global concern. In commenting on this problem in palaeontology as long ago as 1993, Roger Kaesler recognized: > “… we are running out of systematic palaeontologists who have anything > approaching synoptic knowledge of a major group of organisms … > Palaeontologists of the next century are unlikely to have the luxury of > dealing at length with taxonomic problems … Palaeontology will have to > sustain its level of excitement without the aid of systematists, who have > contributed so much to its success.” This expertise deficiency cuts as deeply into those commercial industries that rely on accurate identifications (e.g., agriculture, biostratigraphy) as it does into a wide range of pure and applied research programmes (e.g., conservation, biological oceanography, climatology, ecology). It is also commonly, though informally, acknowledged that the technical, taxonomic literature of all organismal groups is littered with examples of inconsistent and incorrect identifications. This is due to a variety of factors, including taxonomists being insufficiently trained and skilled in making identifications (e.g., using different rules-of-thumb in recognizing the boundaries between similar groups), insufficiently detailed original group descriptions and/or illustrations, inadequate access to current monographs and well-curated collections and, of course, taxonomists having different opinions regarding group concepts. Peer review only weeds out the most obvious errors of commission or omission in this area, and then only when an author provides adequate representations (e.g., illustrations, recordings, and gene sequences) of the specimens in question. Systematics too has much to gain, both practically and theoretically, from the further development and use of automated identification systems. It is now widely recognized that the days of systematics as a field populated by mildly eccentric individuals pursuing knowledge in splendid isolation from funding priorities and economic imperatives are rapidly drawing to a close. In order to attract both personnel and resources, systematics must transform itself into a “large, coordinated, international scientific enterprise” Many have identified use of the Internet— especially via the World Wide Web — as the medium through which this transformation can be made. While establishment of a virtual, GenBank-like system for accessing morphological data, audio clips, video files and so forth would be a significant step in the right direction, improved access to observational information and/or text-based descriptions alone will not address either the taxonomic impediment or low identification reproducibility issues successfully. Instead, the inevitable subjectivity associated with making critical decisions on the basis of qualitative criteria must be reduced or, at the very least, embedded within a more formally analytic context. SDS protein gel images of sphinx moth caterpillars. It can be used in a similar way to DNA fingerprinting Properly designed, flexible, and robust, automated identification systems, organized around distributed computing architectures and referenced to authoritatively identified collections of training set data (e.g., images, and gene sequences) can, in principle, provide all systematists with access to the electronic data archives and the necessary analytic tools to handle routine identifications of common taxa. Properly designed systems can also recognize when their algorithms cannot make a reliable identification and refer that image to a specialist (whose address can be accessed from another database). Such systems can also include elements of artificial intelligence and so improve their performance the more they are used. Most tantalizingly, once morphological (or molecular) models of a species have been developed and demonstrated to be accurate, these models can be queried to determine which aspects of the observed patterns of variation and variation limits are being used to achieve the identification, thus opening the way for the discovery of new and (potentially) more reliable taxonomic characters. * iNaturalist is a global citizen science project and social network of naturalists that incorporates both human and automatic identification of plants, animals, and other living creatures via browser or mobile apps. * Pl@ntNet is a global citizen science project which provides an app and a website for plant identification through photographs, based on machine-learning * Leaf Snap is an iOS app developed by the Smithsonian Institution that uses visual recognition software to identify North American tree species from photographs of leaves. * FlowerChecker bot is a Facebook Chatterbot that uses visual recognition software to identify plant species from photographs.

The show moved to Sundays from 3am to 5am and was also simulcast on BBC Radio 1Xtra. In October 2017, after 6 years of building the show into a global broadcast staple of the drum & bass genre (and a previous return to Mondays from 1am to 3am), the show made one final move to Tuesdays from 1am to 3am. Shortly thereafter, Friction announced he would 'pass the baton' to Canadian DJ/producer, Rene LaVice, who would take over as host of a new drum and bass show on 1Xtra in November 2017.

It is located north of the centre of the city on the western shore of Wellington Harbour, where the Kaiwharawhara Stream reaches the sea from its headwaters in Karori. It is a largely commercial and industrial area and thus has little residential population. The 2013 New Zealand census gave the suburb's resident population as 144 which is an increase of 81 people, or 128.6 percent, since the 2006 Census. A recent housing development up the hillside towards Te Kainga has increased the resident population. Kaiwharawhara contains some major transport infrastructure. Both State Highway 1 and the North Island Main Trunk railway pass through Kaiwharawhara on their routes from central Wellington northwards. Due to its waterfront location, Kaiwharawhara also has shipping activity, with the Wellington Interislander Ferry terminal located on the boundary of Kaiwharawhara and Pipitea. Kaiwharawhara Railway Station was closed in 2013, and the suburb is now served by buses. Just north of the station the Wairarapa Line (including the commuter Hutt Valley Line) diverges from the North Island Main Trunk railway. In sport, Kaiwharawhara was previously represented in soccer by Waterside, a club formed by dock workers in 1921. In 1988, they merged with the Karori Swifts to form Waterside Karori AFC. Etymology and history In pre-European times, the area was known as Kaiwharawhara, which is Māori for 'food' (kai) and 'the fruit of the Astelia (wharawhara). Jerningham Wakefield during the 1840s commented that the stream was called after the \\"wharrawharra\\", and from this, the name was corrupted to Kaiwarra. The suburb (and the station) was renamed from Kaiwarra to Kaiwharawhara from 9 February 1951 by a decision of the New Zealand Geographic Board.New Zealand Railway Observer volume 18, January–February 1951 page 17 The Old Porirua Road went up the Ngaio Gorge to Ngaio and Porirua. From 1890 Kaiwharawhara was part of the Borough of Onslow until the borough amalgamated with Wellington City in 1919. Factories in the area included John Newton's Caledonian soap works from the 1880s to the 1960s, Charles Schultze's flourmill and Hirst's tannery. William Cable & Company had a foundry. The NEECO factory in the 20th century produced electric stoves for state houses and thousands of Army items like steel water bottles in World War II. From the 1920s the Gorge area had large tanks for bulk petrol storage. The railways started construction of railway houses for staff at the Kaiwarra Settlement in 1920, within two miles of the busiest railway yard ... . Toll-gate left A toll-gate was established at Kaiwarra by the Hutt County Council. It caught all vehicular and other traffic in and out of Wellington and made a substantial charge for the maintenance of roads. Hutt County ran from Cook Strait to Waikanae and the Rimutakas and the money was spent on road improvements that gave little or no benefit to Wellington residents. The toll-gate was removed when Kaiwarra joined the Borough of Onslow in 1890. The Hutt County set up new gates on the Hutt Road and Ngauranga Gorge.Wellington City Libraries accessed 14 April 2017  Further reading  * * References Category:Suburbs of Wellington City ","title":"Kaiwharawhara"},{"id":"9788446","text":"The HAMDY mine is an Egyptian directional fragmentation mine based on the US Claymore mine and produced by the Maasara Company.

Biography  Layzell was born and then educated in Jersey at Victoria College Preparatory and then at Hautlieu School. He helped found the island's hospital radio service, in 1975, as a presenter and later producer of the weekly political programme Midweek. In 1977 he joined Channel Television as a junior reporter, then continuity announcer, before returning to the newsroom as a journalist. He produced and directed a number of documentaries for the ITV network including Summer 1940 (the story of the German occupation of the Channel Islands), Around Britain and The Dakota: 1935–1985 marking the fiftieth anniversary of the first flight of the Douglas DC3 airliner. From 1980 he was a regular presenter of the nightly news programme Channel Report and anchored the station's coverage of the Budget and general elections. In 1988, he left Channel Television to form Colonial American which, through its trading arm Colonial Pictures, has become one of Britain's top 150 independent production companies (source: Broadcast Magazine annual survey). As producer and director his early credits included The Only Way to Cross: 150 years of Cunard (for ITV), The Best of Europe (for Discovery Channel USA) and Mansion: Great Houses of Europe – a series of forty programmes with Marcus Binney, architecture correspondent of The Times. More recently he has written, produced and directed Art Deco Designs and In Search of Style – both with the actress Maureen Lipman – for UKTV and ITV, The Flying Picnic (with Annabel Croft) for ITV Anglia and Sky Travel, Garden Makers (presented by Joe Swift) London Visions with Peter Ackroyd (ITV/Sky Arts), and Peter Ackroyd's Venice (Sky Arts). He directed City at War and Legacy of War (ITV/PBS) jointly presented by veteran CBS newsman Walter Cronkite and ITV News anchor Alastair Stewart. The first of these looks at the reporting of the Second World War by correspondents such as Edward R Murrow, the second examines the post-war re- construction of Europe and the onset of the Cold War. For Discovery Channel he produced Britain's Greatest Ships (the story of the new Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth) and for Sky Arts the long-running series Auction. His latest work is in 3D. For Sky 3D he produced and directed Treasure Houses of Britain with Selina Scott, showcasing Blenheim Palace, Chatsworth, Boughton House, Holkham Hall and Burghley House. In 1990 he joined Marcus Binney, President of Save Britain's Heritage, to save Jersey's Government House from demolition. After a campaign which included a 10,000-strong petition and support from the Queen Mother and the Prince of Wales, the decision was overturned by the States and the house re-furbished. In 1991 he and Marcus Binney and Advocate Christopher Scholefield formed Save Jersey's Heritage to fight for the preservation of the island's built heritage. Among their successful campaigns was the restoration of a row of 18th century cottages in the capital, St Helier. =Political career= He entered the States of Jersey in 1993 as a deputy for the parish of St Brelade on an environmental manifesto Notre Ile: A Charter for Change. Among his first speeches was an alternative 'green budget' proposed on Budget Day 1994. As vice-president of the Planning & Environment Committee for six years he helped introduce a new planning law and Island Plan. As president of the Jersey Transport Authority he helped draw up the Service Level Agreement governing the operation of the island's principal sea routes and represented the island in negotiations to protect Jersey's so-called 'lifeline' air routes. As president of the Home Affairs Committee he steered updated legislation through the States including a new terrorism law, a revised firearms law (in the wake of the Dunblane killings) and a Police and Criminal Evidence law. In 2002 he failed to be re-elected in St Brelade, losing out to political newcomer Sarah Ferguson by 34 votes. In February 2003 he contested a by-election for Senator (an island-wide mandate) but lost out by 200 votes to Ted Vibert. In 2006 he was one of the founding members of the St Aubin Anti- Reclamation Group which opposes plans to reclaim land from the sea for a car park in his old parish of St Brelade. =Aviation= He has had a lifelong interest in aviation. In 1972 he wrote (with Michael de la Haye) Sixty Glorious Years: the History of Aviation in Jersey and, in 1987, Announcing the Arrival – to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of Jersey Airport. He led a group of enthusiasts who bought, at auction in 1990, a four-engined de Havilland Heron formerly owned by Jersey Airlines. It now flies from its former home-base. In 1996 he founded the National Air Pageant and, as chairman, led the campaign to prevent the world's last airworthy de Havilland Comet Canopus being sold overseas. It was saved for the nation by Defence Secretary Michael Portillo and now lies at Bruntingthorpe in Leicestershire.

This mountain should not be confused with another Stob Coire Easain, a Munro “Top” on the Munro Stob Coire an Laoigh The Easains stand in splendid isolation, hemmed in by valleys on three sides, giving Stob Coire Easain a substantial topographic prominence of 611 metres.Wikipedia's list of British Mountains by Relative Height. Gives Topographic prominence as 611 metres. The mountain is the highest point on a nine kilometre long ridge which runs the entire length of the western side of Loch Treig; the eastern side of this ridge drops very steeply to the waters of the loch. To the west of the mountain is the valley of the Allt na Lairig. A subsidiary ridge going north from the summit is initially steep and craggy as it descends to the head of Coire Laire. To the south of the summit the main ridge descends gently over Irlick Chaoile to the lonely country at the head of Loch Treig. All drainage from the mountain goes into the River Spean to find its way to the west coast of Scotland via Loch Linnhe. Because of their close proximity, the Easains are usually climbed together with the best starting point being at the hamlet of Fersit () where there is room to park a number of cars on the verges. The north east ridge of Stob a’ Choire Mheadhoin is followed to the summit; it is then a steep descent and climb across the stony col to the summit of Stob Coire Easain. An alternative walk utilises the West Highland Line, with the walker starting at Corrour railway station and traversing round the head of Loch Treig to gain the main ridge of the Easains, which can then be crossed south to north finishing at Fersit.\\"The Munros\\" Page 78 (Suggests both the given routes of ascent).

Moreover, he was a serial criminal and faked his own death in 1966 in order to escape prosecution for his crimes up to that point. Biography Allen was born as Anthony John Angel on 11 June 1934 in Torbay, though grew up largely in Bournemouth. In the 1950s he married his first wife, Monica, before being caught stealing money from his workplace in 1966. To escape conviction, he faked his own suicide in 1967 by \\"drowning\\" near Beachy Head, a popular spot for suicides in Britain, leaving a pile of clothes and a suicide note. After assuming a new identity, he met Patricia and married her illegally soon after. In July 1968, Allen was convicted of bigamy and other crimes, receiving a suspended prison sentence. In 1970, Allen would be convicted of burning three bags of mail that he was meant to deliver, and spend one year in jail. Allen would go on to divorce his first wife and marry Patricia legally in 1972. By May 1975, Allen and his wife had two children, Jonathan, aged 7, and Victoria, aged 5, and were living in Salcombe, Devon. Allen was also having an affair with Eunice Yabley. Allen claimed that between 25 and 30 May 1975, he and his wife had an argument and she left, returning two days later to take the children. Allen did not report the three missing and none of the three were seen again. His wife's car was later found nearby with dinghy oars inside. Although police investgated at the time, there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution. In 1992, five years after splitting up with Allen, Yabley published an autobiographical book, Presumed Dead, focusing on her relationship with Allen and the unsolved mystery. In it was mentioned that Allen had scratches on his arms in May 1975. The police re- opened the murder enquiry in 2001, when they discovered that the man Allen had named as Patricia's boyfriend had suffered a severe stroke in 1972, and so would have been unable to help Patricia in the manner Allen had said. Allen died on 8 August 2015, still maintaining his innocence.

History and construction The Revd Henry Michell Wagner, who had occupied the position of Vicar of Brighton since 1824, died in 1870, giving his son, the Revd Arthur Douglas Wagner (the curate of St Paul's Church in West Street), the opportunity to continue and improve his father's proposals for new parish churches in Brighton. He undertook three such schemes in the 1870s, two in conjunction with his two half-brothers, but Saint Bartholomew's is the only church which was his sole responsibility throughout. In 1868, Arthur Wagner had built a temporary church on Providence Place, a back street parallel with the main London Road, along with a school accommodating 400 pupils. After his father's death, he resolved to build a more impressive new church in the same area. The original plan, which was submitted to the Town Council in 1871 and approved on 7 June of that year, consisted of a combined church and school building, 322 feet in length, 46 feet wide, and 41¾ feet high. This was amended shortly afterwards to reduce the number of bays in the interior from 13 to 11½; the additional space formed a \\"courtyard\\" area between the church and the existing school building, which was to be retained. Building work began on 8 February 1872; but Wagner's plans changed again, in favour of a significantly taller structure. When they were submitted on 16 September 1873, the revised plans reduced the length to 170 feet, but widened the building to 59 feet and, most significantly, proposed a height of 135 feet to the ridge of the roof. The cross on the roof at the south end (the liturgical west end) adds a further 9 feet to this. Construction based on the new plan started shortly after its submission, and continued for 19 months. The official opening was on 18 September 1874, while building work was still taking place; and with entirely free seating throughout (for up to 1,500 worshippers) it became the first church in Brighton to offer universal free entrance from the date of opening. This was not welcomed by local members of the clergy, who had historically gained reliable incomes from the practice of \\"pew rents\\". Architecture and design A Brighton-based architect, Edmund Scott, was commissioned by Wagner to undertake the design work—although modern interpretations of the modest nature of the work he undertook elsewhere in Brighton and surrounding areas tend to agree that he may have been directed and influenced extensively by Wagner, \\"a client who was prepared to disregard expense\\" on this project. Scott was not associated with any particular architectural movement, and worked alone on most of his projects, many of which no longer survive, although the Gothic Revival St Botolph's Church in the Heene area of nearby Worthing, built in 1873, remains an important example of his work. Two earlier examples of his less grand designs still remain in Portslade in the form of the Early English style St Andrew's Church, built in 1864 as a free and open church with no pew rents, and the original St Nicolas Church School, built in 1872 and now in use as an annex of Portslade Infants School. =Exterior= The exterior appearance is unusual and severe, especially because of the building's height and the manner in which it towers above nearby streets of low-level buildings. Many of the houses and other buildings which originally surrounded the church have been cleared, accentuating the contrast. However, the slightly taller buildings of the nearby New England Quarter development now reduce the church's visual impact from some angles, especially as the land they are built on is at a slightly higher level. High walls of reddish-brown brick, now aged to a purplish-brown colour, are topped by a steeply pitched roof with dark tiling. A mixture of red and black tiles were originally applied, but the roof was re-tiled in its present monochrome form in 1930. Running the length of the east and west sides of the exterior walls are a series of narrow buttresses with tall, pointed windows. On the south side, an unusually large rose window dominates the area below the apex of the roof, upon which stands a 9-foot gilt cross which brings the total height of the structure to 144 feet. The building work was undertaken by a Brighton company, Stanning & Co., and cost £18,000 (1874 prices). This was in contrast to the £25,000 spent on St Peter's church around 50 years previously, under the supervision of Arthur Wagner's father, Henry Michell Wagner. The use of Portland stone on the latter added to the expense; the use of bricks for St Bartholomew's helped to reduce it, as did the abandonment of the revised plan's intention to build 11½ bays. (Only nine were constructed.) Additionally, the northern face of the church was never properly completed, and proposals for additional features such as transepts and a spire mentioned in contemporary publications were never carried out. =Interior= The nave High altar Henry Wilson dating from 1902 Openness and a relative lack of division into smaller sections characterises the interior, giving an impression of vast space which is enhanced by the uninterrupted height: the church is effectively one large hall. Each side wall has several tall arches underneath which side-chapels are located, but these are well integrated with the nave. Above this is a shallow triforium, and above this, immediately below the roof line, is the clerestory with its tall pointed windows. The interior walls are mostly made up of unadorned brickwork identical to that of the exterior. However, built into the northern end wall, above the altar, is a substantial cross, 30 feet high and built from Sussex chalk; and a set of carved wood and stone Stations of the Cross brought from Bruges in 1881 are located on the walls of the side-chapels. Also, the walls above the altar support a range of mosaics by F. Hamilton Jackson, a follower of the Arts and Crafts movement. The High altar and sanctuary themselves are highly decorative, and are among a range of new features introduced under the stewardship of the Revd Arthur W. C. Cocks, who became vicar of St Bartholomomew's in 1895. Architect and designer Henry Wilson, who was the first editor of the Architectural Review magazine when it was founded in 1896 and who was also involved in the Arts and Crafts movement, was responsible for the work undertaken at this time, having been appointed in 1895 upon the death of Edmund Scott. The sanctuary is dominated by a 45-foot baldacchino in red and green marble, with a new altar below housing a silver tabernacle and a white marble shelf with a large crucifix and six candlesticks. In 1908 this was flanked by a pair of white marble columns bearing two further candles. One of the side chapels contains a Lady altar designed in intricate repoussé silver on copper by Wilson in 1902. The High altar's original crucifix was moved to this altar in 1912, with a new crucifix of a different design replacing it. Wilson designed and built a new pulpit, again in a variety of marbles, in 1906. Six red marble columns stand on a base of black marble and support a large block of green Irish marble, similar in colour to that of the baldacchino's marble canopy. At the same time, a large organ gallery was built at the south end of the church to house the organ and up to 150 choristers and orchestra members; and in 1908, a large octagonal font, again in green marble, is located in a recess on the south-eastern side of the church. Wilson's association with St Bartholomew's ended in 1911, when Arthur Cocks left (having converted to Roman Catholicism) and his successor, the Revd Henry Ross, brought his own ideas in. Few of these were carried out, partly because of the disruption caused by World War I, although the mosaics above the altar were completed in 1912. The aborted plans included a second attempt at completing the north end, which was still unfinished; a subsequent third attempt failed to proceed because of a lack of funding, with the re-tiling of the roof being the priority at that time (1930). =\\"Tallest church\\" claims= Many sources claim that St Bartholomew's is the \\"tallest church in England\\", \\"the British Isles\\", or a variation on this. This requires some clarification; many churches are taller when their spires or steeples are included, and even the tallest church - St Walburge's Church in Preston, Lancashire, whose spire reaches - is exceeded in height by four English cathedrals. However, St Bartholomew's lacks any form of steeple or tower, and the quoted height of is therefore the height to the apex of the roof -- with the gilt cross adding a further 9 feet. If towers, steeples and spires are excluded, therefore, the \\"tallest church\\" claim has greater merit. Similarly, when cathedrals are excluded and only parish churches considered, the nave is the largest in Britain. Nevertheless, comparative measurements are difficult to obtain. =Reaction to the building= The stark and unusual design and the relatively opulent interior caused considerable controversy at first, especially among more reactionary Anglicans mistrustful of the Anglo-Catholic nature of Wagner and, by extension, his church. Musgrave (1981) notes that a letter written to the Brighton Herald in 1874, by a writer \\"who signed himself 'a true Protestant and no sham', expressed the deepest disquiet over such features as a certain 'dark spiral staircases... off which little and almost dark rooms, or cells... are built.'\\" The writer accuses these of housing nunneries or anchorites, and questions whether the building is indeed being used solely as a church. In fact, the staircases and \\"cells\\" are merely parts of the triforium. A remarkable debate at the Town Council in 1893, at which it was reported that the overall height of the building was two feet higher than that approved in the plans of 1873, led to a further barrage of criticism. As the statutory fine for the planning violation was only 40 shillings (£2), it was considered irrelevant to impose it on the rich Wagner; but records of the debate indicate that a variety of derogatory descriptions of the building were made, including (as per Musgrave) \\"a cheese warehouse\\", \\"a Noah's Ark in brick\\", \\"a monster excrescence\\", \\"a brick parallelogram\\", \\"a huge barn\\", \\"uselessly large, painfully ugly and sadly out of place\\", and \\"Wagner's folly\\". (References to \\"Noah's Ark\\" are sometimes still heard today, mainly in relation to the shape and dimensions of the building.) Additionally, residents of the houses formerly occupying the land immediately to the west of the church – where the London Road car park, St Bartholomew's school, and the eastern end of the New England Quarter stand today – complained to Wagner that the height of the church caused downward draughts of wind which caused their chimneys to smoke excessively. Wagner's financial resources allowed him to buy some of the houses and reduce the tenants' rents, in order to avoid continued objections. The church today The church is a Grade I-listed building, meaning that it is a building \\"of outstanding or national architectural or historic interest\\". Its size gives it unique acoustics and the ability to accommodate large numbers of people, making it an ideal venue for classical and other music concerts.

The station was located on an embankment at the southern edge of Longton to the east of the road running south (now Liverpool Road). The line was double track and platforms were provided on both sides. The main station building, \\"built in the company's typical red brick style\\" was to the north of the running lines, there was a signal box at the end of the Preston bound platform. There was a small goods yard to the north and east of the station able to accommodate most types of goods including live stock, it was equipped with single line shed and a one ton crane. Early services Upon opening a service of nine trains in each direction was advertised for each weekday, an additional train on Saturdays for the market and four trains each way on Sundays. Takeover The railway company had financial difficulties which led to it being absorbed by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) on 1 July 1897. The L&YR; amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;) on 1 January 1922 just one year before being grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) on 1 January 1923. Later services In 1922 the L&NWR; service had increased to 18 trains stopping here from mainly going to , otherwise one went to and one to . There were an extra three trains on Saturdays and the Accrington train carried on to . The services in the other direction were similar, there were five services each way on Sundays. By 1939 the LMS service was 22 trains each way on weekdays (all to or from Preston, except one to Todmorden, one to Accrington (except on Saturdays) and one to East Lancashire) with three additional services on Saturdays, there were 9 trains each way on Sundays. By January 1962, the London Midland Region of British Railways were operating 11 trains each way, with three to six additional services on Saturdays. There were no trains on Sundays.

The Tykes signed Bryan from Newport Gwent Dragons in May 2006. He made his Tykes début against Nottingham R.F.C. on 1 October 2006 at Meadow Lane as a replacement in a 37-30 victory. \\"I am very pleased to be joining Leeds after a difficult few months in Wales,\\" said Bryan on joining the club, \\"This will give me a chance to restart my career and the club share a lot of my ambitions. Next year will be a fresh start for the Tykes, with the amount of new players signing for the club and young players being promoted, and that is great for me.

Biography Born and raised in Gloucester, Massachusetts, Toups met and married U.S. Navy sailor Emile Joseph Toups, a Mississippi native, in Gloucester, Massachusetts. She returned with him to his home state in 1965, the year he mustered out of the Navy. They settled in Gulfport, Mississippi and raised six children. Her parents realized, on one of their visits to the Gulf Coast, that a stay-at-home mother of six young children needed a diversion. In the late 1980s, Toups rescued a sharp-shinned hawk from the front screened porch of a house in Bay St. Louis. The bird had barreled through the screen in pursuit of a squirrel and had been trapped on the porch, disoriented and unable to find the door and freedom. With only a quilt between her and sharp beak and talons, Toups dropped the bed covering over this formidable raptor, and ... carrying the trailing tails of the quilt, she carried the swaddled bird outside and let it go. Toups founded the Mississippi Coast Audubon Society and advanced its conservation causes, including the high-profile protection program for terns and black skimmers. She sent fledgling birders out across Coast terrain in search of native and visiting birds. She developed the Mississippi Coastal Birding Trail map, and wrote two books on birding the Gulf Coast. There is a trail named after her in Jackson County's Ward Bayou, and she was honoured by many birding societies. A portion of U.S. Highway 90 in Gulfport bordering the nesting areas she sought to protect was renamed the Judith Toups Least Tern Highway in early 2008. Following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, Toups relocated to Decatur, Alabama, where she died, aged 76, from undisclosed causes, on February 27, 2007, aged 76.

Purpose  A stile at Busbiehill, North Ayrshire. 2007. If the gatepost is utilitarian in purpose then gateposts will be made as strictly functional structures; however as part of the 'advertisement' of the status of the family who live beyond, they are often carefully designed and constructed and sometimes highly ornate or individualistic. Gateposts give an additional element of character to the countryside and conurbations, significantly they also play host a habitat for many lichen, moss and liverwort species.  Construction materials  They are often made of wood, such as old railway sleepers, telegraph poles or even tree trunks. For a longer 'life' more resilient iron girders or pipes may be used and concrete posts are sometimes employed. The older examples were often made of stone, such as granite, whinstone, sandstone or limestone. Occasionally standing stones have been moved and re-used as gateposts, especially on Dartmoor and in Cornwall. Bricks are frequently used and some are made from stones or small boulders, tending to be cylindrical in shape.  Slip gate piers and stoups  'L'-shaped grooves to slide in the crossbar. Square concavities to receive the horizontal crossbars Slip gates are a form of gate which permits people and vehicles through an entrance but which blocks the passage of animals. Branches or worked wood crossbars or stangs were used, one field slip gate pier with 'L' shaped grooves and the opposing stile gatepost with square or circular concavities to receive the three or four horizontal crossbars. Most of these have long been converted to carry hinged gates, though one survives unaltered at the Museum of Scottish Rural Life, Kittochside on Wester Kittochside farm, East Kilbride, Scotland. They were sometimes made entirely of wood, such as oak, which is relatively long lasting. The term 'Stoup' is used in Cumbria and some examples are elaborately finished, with dates and initials and even whole names, sometimes with the sort of flowing script more usually found on gravestones. One example is dated as far back as 1663.Rollinson, William (1998). Making Drystone Walls. Pub. Smith Settle. . Pp. 36 - 39. The shape of the stile gateposts is variable, mostly being oblong and square in section; however, some were tombstone- shaped, having two flat sides and a curved top.  Gatepost designs  =Ornate gateposts= A view of the Lodge at Robertland with four gateposts. Circa 1930. Gate of the Winter Palace in St Petersburg. Many houses have driveways of varying lengths and gateposts are a way of making a social statement of status, through the cost implications of an ornate or 'awe inspiring' entrance way. Some entrances had two or even three gates attached to the gateposts, such as at Robertland House in East Ayrshire, Scotland, the side gates being for the use of pedestrians. The gates themselves could be wood or more commonly cast iron, wrought iron or mild steel. A large number of the cast iron gates were removed by the Ministry of Works in World War II to be melted down and used to build weapons, etc. Once removed these gates were rarely replaced. A sign of very high status was to have sufficient wealth to have gatehouses or lodges near the gates. Some estates had several lodges and the owners would at one time have employed people to live in these buildings and their jobs would be to open and close the gates, thereby controlling the movements of livestock and also of visitors, some of whom would be denied access or directed way from the front door to the tradesman's entrance. The date of construction can often be deduced from the style, many being Victorian, due to the wealth creation of the period and the number of large dwellings consequently constructed. Large balls, looking like finials are sometimes precariously perched on top of gateposts, as at Woodway House in Teignmouth, South Devon. =Estate gateposts= Country estates, usually having one owner, tend to show a degree of uniformity in the design of gateposts, which were mostly purchased at the same time. Different estates can sometimes be 'mapped' by the gateposts used, various designs being supplied for the different landowners to choose from. It may be that the same suppliers also made milestones for the turnpike trusts as the two are sometimes of very similar appearance. Many gateposts have been removed to allow for the access of larger modern farm machinery, sometimes only one has been moved and the other left in situ.

It was originally intended as a forum for unconventional ideas without the traditional filter of scientific peer review, \\"as long as (the ideas) are coherent and clearly expressed\\" in order to \\"foster the diversity and debate upon which the scientific process thrives.\\" Medical Hypotheses was the only Elsevier journal that did not send submitted papers to other scientists for review. Articles were chosen instead by the journal's editor-in-chief based on whether he considered the submitted work interesting and important. The journal's policy placed full responsibility for the integrity, precision and accuracy of publications on the authors, rather than peer reviewers or the editor. The publication of papers on AIDS denialism led to calls to remove it from PubMed, the United States National Library of Medicine online journal database. Following the AIDS papers controversy, Elsevier forced a change in the journal's leadership. In June 2010, Elsevier announced that \\"Submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Editor and external reviewers to ensure their scientific merit\\". The journal remains not peer reviewed in the conventional sense—the editor called it \\"not a classical peer review system. I call it a Medical Hypotheses custom-made review system.\\"  Founding and editorship  Medical Hypotheses was founded in 1975 by physiologist David Horrobin, who was the editor-in-chief of the journal until his death in 2003 as well as the head of the Schizophrenia Association in Britain. Horrobin was a controversial figure, a scientist and entrepreneur best known for his promotion of evening primrose oil as a treatment for diseases, leading the British Medical Journal (BMJ) to predict that he \\"may prove to be the greatest snake oil salesman of his age.\\" Horrobin wrote in his inaugural editorial for Medical Hypotheses: \\"The history of science has repeatedly shown that when hypotheses are proposed it is impossible to predict which will turn out to be revolutionary and which ridiculous. The only safe approach is to let all see the light and to let all be discussed, experimented upon, vindicated or destroyed. I hope the journal will provide a new battlefield open to all on which ideas can be tested and put through the fire.\\" In its first edition, Medical Hypotheses published articles from its editorial review board member, virologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet, in vitro fertilization pioneer Ian Johnston, Gerald Kolodny of Beth Israel Medical Center, and Tom Tenforde, later chief scientist of the United States Department of Energy. After Horrobin's death, Bruce G. Charlton, a professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne and theoretical medicine at the University of Buckingham, became the editor, making publication decisions with the informal assistance of an advisory board. Horrobin had described Charlton as \\"the only person I really trust to take it over and run it in an open-minded fashion\\". Notable members of the advisory board included behavioral neurologist António Damásio, cognitive neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran, surgical pioneer Roy Calne, psychiatrist David Healy, philosopher David Pearce, and the Nobel laureate Arvid Carlsson. Mehar Manku became the editor of Medical Hypotheses after Charlton was fired in 2010.\\"New Medical Hypotheses Editor Promises Not to Stir Up Controversy\\" Martin Enserink, ScienceInsider, 25 June 2010. Medical Hypotheses was initially published by Eden Press. Elsevier has been its publisher since 2002.  Abstracting and indexing  The journal is abstracted and indexed in the Science Citation Index, Index Medicus/MEDLINE/PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, Chemical Abstracts, Elsevier BIOBASE/Current Awareness in Biological Sciences, Current Contents/Clinical Medicine, Current Contents/Life Sciences, and EMBASE/Excerpta Medica.  Research  The most widely cited articleaccording to Web of Science from Medical Hypotheses was published in 1991 by Ronald S. Smith in which he proposed the macrophage theory of depression as an alternative to the monoamine theory of depression. Other famous articles featured in the journal include the proposal from Jarl Flensmark of Malmö, Sweden, that schizophrenia may be caused by wearing heeled shoes, and an article from Svetlana Komarova of McGill University positing that facial hair may play a role in preventing the development of cancer. In what psychiatrist and The Guardian columnist Ben Goldacre called an \\"almost surreally crass paper\\", two Medical Hypotheses authors posited \\"mongoloid\\" as an accurate term for people with Down syndrome because those with Down syndrome share characteristics with people of Asian origin, including a reported interest in crafts, sitting with crossed legs and eating foods containing monosodium glutamate (MSG). Correspondence items have presented masturbation as a treatment for nasal congestion. Science reported that a 2009 paper by Georg Steinhauser on navel lint \\"became an instant classic\\". In 2007, journalist Roger Dobson published a book in which he collected and described 100 Medical Hypotheses articles called Death Can Be Cured.  Peer review debate  Horrobin began the journal in response to what he viewed as the limitations of peer review. He wrote, \\"The primary criteria for acceptance are very different from the usual journals. In essence what I look for are answers to two questions only: Is there some biological plausibility to what the author is saying? Is the paper readable? We are NOT looking at whether or not the paper is true but merely at whether it is interesting.\\" According to physiologist John Stein, Horrobin believed from his days as an undergraduate that peer review encourages adherence to currently accepted ideas at the expense of innovation. Also neuroscientist Vilayanur Ramachandran, who is on the journal's editorial review board, told Science: \\"There are ideas that may seem implausible but which are very important if true. This is the only place you can get them published.\\" At October 2012, an international campaign involving 198 scientists published a critical article defending Bruce G. Charlton and the idea of editorial review. = AIDS denialism papers and fallout = In 2009, the journal's publisher, Elsevier, withdrew two articles written by AIDS denialists that had been accepted for publication. One of the withdrawn articles, written by Peter Duesberg and David Rasnick, claimed that there is \\"yet no proof that HIV causes AIDS\\" and was not responsible for deaths in South Africa that another paper had attributed to it and misrepresented the results of medical research on antiretroviral drugs. This paper had originally been submitted to the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes (JAIDS), but it was rejected after peer review. One of the editors of JAIDS later cited problems with the paper, alleging that it had contained cherry-picking and other dishonest claims. The publisher stated that the articles \\"could potentially be damaging to global public health. Concern has also been expressed that the article contains potentially libelous material. Given these important signals of concern, we judge it correct to investigate the circumstances in which this article came to be published online.\\" The withdrawal followed a campaign by scientists who criticised the articles' factual accuracy and the process behind their acceptance. A group of 20 HIV scientists and advocates contacted the National Library of Medicine to request that the journal be removed from the MEDLINE database alleging that the journal lacked scientific rigor and had become a \\"tool for the legitimization of at least one pseudoscientific movement: AIDS denialism.\\" Economist Nicoli Nattrass wrote in an article in AIDS and Behavior that \\"Medical Hypotheses has long been a source of concern in the scientific community because the articles are not peer-reviewed,\\" and that the National Library of Medicine had been requested to review the journal \\"for de-selection from PubMed on the grounds that it was not peer-reviewed and had a disturbing track record of publishing pseudo-science.\\" Nattrass later wrote that as a result of the controversy, Science reported that Elsevier had asked that the journal's editor either raise the standards of review or resign.Martin Enserink, Elsevier to Editor: Change Controversial Journal or Resign . Science, March 8, 2010 A review panel convened by Elsevier recommended that Medical Hypotheses adopt some form of peer review to avoid publication of \\"baseless, speculative, non-testable and potentially harmful ideas\\". Editor Bruce Charlton said that peer review went against the journal's 30-year history and is not supported by either him or the journal's editorial board. Elsevier reportedly told Charlton that his position would not be renewed at the end of the year, and Charlton said he would not resign. On May 11, 2010 Bruce Charlton announced on his blog that he \\"was sacked\\" by Elsevier. Of the journal's 19 editorial board members, 13 wrote to Elsevier to protest the decision to change the journal's editorial policies. The group of scientists wrote that not having peer review \\"is an integral part of our identity, indeed our very raison d'être,\\" and they would resign their positions if it was instituted. One of the members, David Healy of the University of Cardiff School of Medicine, said that the review board members' letter was \\"a defense of Bruce, not of the Duesberg paper.\\" In contrast, board member António Damásio said that the paper should not have been published on the journal's website. In June 2010, Elsevier announced the appointment of Mehar Manku as the new editor, and stated that \\"submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Editor and external reviewers to ensure their scientific merit. All reviewers will be fully aware of the Aims and Scope of the journal and will be judging the premise, originality and plausibility of the hypotheses submitted.\\" Manku was previously the Editor of Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids, another journal founded by Horrobin.

After being convicted—along with three others—for the killings, he served seven years in the Maze Prison before his release in 2000 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Early life  Knight spent his formative years living at his grandmother's farmhouse in the rural area of Aghadowey, County Londonderry, after his parents separated. In early adulthood he developed an addiction to poker gambling machines which resulted in his exposure of stealing money from his grandmother to fund his habit. As a result of this, he was asked to leave the home and subsequently moved to the town of Portstewart, County Londonderry. Living with a loyalist, he started drinking alcohol and involving himself with criminality.Greysteel - Confessions of a serial killer Belfast Telegraph Paramilitary activity His initial starting point within loyalism was selling a magazine for a loyalist prisoners' association. He progressed to the ranks of the UDA and carried out acts like robberies and punishment beatings. Knight was part of a four-man UDA group sent to conduct an attack in revenge for the Shankill Road bombing. Their target was the Rising Sun bar in Greysteel, where Knight, Stephen Irwin, Jeffrey Deeney and Brian McNeill shot eight dead (six Catholics and two Protestants). After the leading gunman, Irwin shouted \\"trick or treat\\", he and Deeney raked the bar with gunfire, while Knight, armed with a shotgun, stood at the door. A total of 19 other people were injured.

He served seven years in the Maze Prison before paramilitary prisoners were granted a general release under the Good Friday Agreement in 2000.Loyalist killer found guilty of assault, The Irish Times, 22 October 2009, retrieved 27 October 2009NI prisoners savour freedom, BBC News, 28 July 2000 Allegations of being an informant According to David McKittrick, there had been rumours that Knight had been a police informer.Was this loyalist murderer in the police's pay?, David McKittrick, The Independent, 18 February 2006, retrieved 27 October 2009 Suspicions have been voiced by John Dallat, a member of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). Dallat, who said he was in touch with police about Knight before the attacks in Greysteel and Castlerock, claimed they might have been prevented since it was known Knight was an extremist. In 2000 Knight attracted the attention of staff at a bank where he was withdrawing large amounts of money from an account into which £50,000 a year was being paid. The bank's concern was that Knight was involved in money laundering, but, when police were contacted, an assurance was given that everything was in order. The money was said to be from a Scottish engineering firm, but the account was quickly closed down.Freed Ulster killer 'paid £50,000 salary for being police informer', Rosie Cowan and Owen Bowcott, The Guardian, 16 February 2009 Police ombudsman Nuala O'Loan investigated Dallat's claim that police had prior information about Greysteel, stating that there was no evidence this was the case. She also stated that Knight's conviction and sentence led her to believe that he was not being protected by police, but added that it was beyond her remit to investigate whether or not he was a paid informer. Alleged membership of Apprentice Boys In 2008 Sinn Féin councillor Billy Leonard claimed that Knight was a member of the Kilrea branch of the Apprentice Boys. It was claimed that Knight took part in a parade in Kilrea and laid a wreath at the cenotaph in the village. The Kilrea branch of the Apprentice Boys denied this as did Knight himself. A spokesman stated that Knight wasn't a member and that they will demand an apology and explanation from Sinn Féin.UFF killer Torrens Knight claim is refuted by Kilrea Apprentice Boys-Coleraine TimesGreysteel Killer-I am a changed man-The Newsletter Knight also stated that John Dallat and Billy Leonard are taking part in a 'hate campaign' against him and challenged the nationalist politicians 'to get off his back'.Torrens Knight-I have changed,leave me alone-Coleraine Times 2009 conviction In October 2009, Knight was found guilty of assaulting two sisters in a bar in Coleraine. As a result, his early release licence was suspended and he was returned to jail.Loyalist killer returned to jail, Éanna Ó Caollaí, The Irish Times, 27 October 2009 He was later sentenced to four months jail for the assault. The judge said \\"The injuries sustained were consistent with a vicious attack on the two women and of particular concern in this case is that you kicked Ms Nicholl while she was on the ground, prone and unable to defend herself.... People who do that can expect no mercy or sympathy from these courts. You acted as a bully when you approached these sisters. You lost control and lashed out\\". After Knight was returned to prison in 2009 it was revealed that Trevor Collins, a member of Jim Allister's Traditional Unionist Voice political party from Garvagh, was collecting signatures campaigning for his release from prison. The TUV said it would not be taking action against Collins for instigating the petition.TUV 'won't take action' over Knight petition, BBC News, 4 December 2009 Knight was released on 6 August 2010.

The virus took its original name from the city of Junín, around which the first cases of infection were reported, in 1958. Morphology and genome structure Argentinian mammarenavirus is a negative sense ssRNA enveloped virion with a variable diameter between 50 and 300 nm. The surface of the particle encompasses a layer of T-shaped glycoproteins, each extending up to 10 nm outwards from the envelope, which are important in mediating attachment and entry into host cells. The Argentinian mammarenavirus genome is composed of two single-stranded RNA molecules, each encoding two different genes in an ambisense orientation. The two segments are termed 'short (S)' and 'long (L)' owing to their respective lengths. The short segment (around 3400 nucleotides in length) encodes the nucleocapsid protein and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC). The GPC is subsequently cleaved to form two viral glycoproteins, GP1 and GP2, which ultimately form the T-shaped glycoprotein spike which extends outwards from the viral envelope. . The long segment (around 7200 nucleotides in length) encodes the viral polymerase and a zinc-binding protein. The virus is spread by rodents. Epidemiology and disease A member of the genus Mammarenavirus, Argentinian mammarenavirus characteristically causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). AHF leads to severe compromise of the vascular, neurological and immune systems and has a mortality rate between 20 and 30%. Symptoms of the disease are conjunctivitis, purpura, petechiae and occasionally sepsis. The symptoms of the disease can be confusing; the condition can be mistaken for a different one, especially during the first week when it can resemble a flu. Since the discovery of Argentinian mammarenavirus in 1958, the geographical distribution of the pathogen, although still confined to Argentina, has expanded. At the time of discovery, Argentinian mammarenavirus was confined to an area of around 15,000 km². At the beginning of 2000, the region with reported cases grew to around 150,000 km². The natural hosts of Argentinian mammarenavirus are rodents, particularly Mus musculus, Calomys spp. and Akodon azarae. Direct rodent-to- human transmission only takes place when a person makes direct contact with the excrement of an infected rodent; this can occur by ingestion of contaminated food or water, inhalation of particles in urine or direct contact of an open wound with rodent feces. Prevention and control An investigational (in the US) vaccine (Candid1) was developed at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) at Ft. Detrick, MD in the 1980s which has shown to be safe, well tolerated and effective in reducing mortality and morbidity due to AHF. The vaccine, which came from an XJ strain of the Argentinian mammarenavirus, was continually passaged a total of 44 times in newborn mouse brains, and a total of 19 times along with cloning in FRhL cells. Over 90% of the volunteers in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials developed antibodies against the Argentinian mammarenavirus, and 99% developed an adequate immune response specific for Argentinian mammarenavirus. Moreover, a large efficacy study among 6,500 people, where 3,255 individuals were randomly selected to take Candid 1 and 3,245 individuals were randomly selected to take a placebo resulted in 23 cases of Junin-like infections, where 22 out of the 23 cases were from the placebo group. This efficacy study resulted in a 95% vaccine efficacy. Currently, the Candid 1 vaccine, otherwise known as the Junin vaccine, is licensed in Argentina by the regulatory agency of Argentina where Argentinian mammarenavirus is endemic to the region. People in laboratories who come in constant contact with Argentinian mammarenavirus are also recommended to take the Junin vaccine to prevent transmission.Pittman, Phillip R., and Stanley A. Plotkin.

The distillery is currently run by Jacopo Poli together with his siblings Giampaolo, Barbara and Andrea. The raw material from which Grappa is made is the grape pomace, the skin of the grape, and what is left after the grape is crushed in order to make wine. The Poli Distillery gathers the grape- pomace from an area that ranges from Bassano del Grappa to the hills surrounding Marostica and Breganze, lands historically famous for the cultivation of grape vines and for the production of Grappa. Poli Distillery distill exclusively fresh grape-pomace coming from the wineries of the area. The still is among the oldest in use today. It consists of cauldrons completely made of copper, as in centuries gone by. The distillation cycle is discontinuous. This means that the grape-pomace is put into the cauldrons and distilled using steam; after about three hours the cauldrons are unloaded and the cycle begins again. Visitors are welcome by appointment. In Bassano del Grappa, in front of the historic wooden bridge \\"Ponte Vecchio\\", the Poli Distillery created the Poli Grappa Museum, where the history of distillation and the history of Grappa are illustrated with efficacy in a small but suggestive area, by means of a brief but detailed educational tour.

History  The Archer Grand Prix was run annually for over fifty years, organised by Stuart Benstead of the Archer Road Club (although Stuart Cook organised the last two events in 2006 and 2007). It was described by British Cycling as a \\"long running classic\\". The first edition was held in 1956 and won by British rider, Alfred Howling. 1968 saw the first non-British winner when Jan Krekels of the Netherlands won the race. The race has in the past, adopted the name of its main sponsor, including Harp, Pernod and Cycling Weekly. Consistently routed around the roads and lanes of the Chiltern Hills, the most recent route was split into a large and small circuit. The large circuit took in Whiteleaf Hill and Hughenden Valley while the small finish circuit included the finish at Winchmoor Hill. The 2007 edition was won by Simon Gaywood riding for the Plowman Craven Associates team from Matt Talbot (Rapha Condor) and Andy Roche (Pinarello). The 53rd version of the race was scheduled to run in Spring 2008 but had to be cancelled because of policing issues. The future of the race then became uncertain; it was scheduled to be held again on 19 April 2009, but sponsorship problems led to a second cancellation.

It was founded in 1735 by (1700-1750) in connection with the establishment of the Georg-August- Universität in the same city. After Abraham Vandenhoeck's death in 1750, his English-born widow, Anna Vandenhoeck, née Parry (d. 1787) successfully continued the business together with Carl Friedrich Günther Ruprecht (born 1730), who had entered the business as an eighteen-year-old apprentice in 1748. At the death of Anna Vandenhoeck in 1787, Ruprecht took over the business which he led until his death in 1816, when he was succeeded by his 25-year-old son Carl August Adolf Ruprecht (1791-1861). The management of the company remained in the hands of the Ruprecht family for seven generations. The traditional core areas of the publications of V&R; are Theology and Religion, History, Ancient History, Philosophy and Philology. Current production also includes schoolbooks and non-academic publications. In 1935, the Göttingen Academy of Sciences gave Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht responsibility for its publications. These include the Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, the Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, and the Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, the last of which is the oldest academic journal in the German-language area. During the Nazi period, V&R; published the journal Junge Kirche (\\"Young Church\\"), the mouthpiece of the anti-Nazi Protestant movement Confessing Church. The periodical was shut down by the authorities in 1941; for the rest of World War II, the company was forced to limit its publishing to philology, natural sciences and text books for school teaching. After the war, it went back to its earlier ambitions to be a comprehensive academic press.

The name is also applied to buildings made within its geographical limits before the constitution of Silesia as a duchy (earlier than 1172) or before this name was given to those territories, and largely depends on the historical moment. Due to historic, geographic and generational diversity, Silesian architecture has known a host of influences.  Romanesque architecture  rotunda in Cieszyn The Romanesque art in Silesia appeared with the Christianization of the region. The first known structure, relics of a church on Ostrów Tumski in Wrocław (Breslau), was built in the mid-10th century. Around 1000 Bolesław I of Poland founded a three-nave cathedral on the same place, styled after the cathedral in Gniezno. Few other buildings of that time are known. The rotunda in Cieszyn (Teschen, Těšín), of Moravian- Bohemian origin, dates back to 1050. The 12th century was a time of great advancement. The first monasteries and minsters, in Wrocław and Lubiąż (Leubus), were built, and the quality of work improved significant, as the builders adopted architectural styles from Southern Germany and Meuse. Outstanding achievements of this era were the cathedral and the abbey church of the Benedictine order in Wrocław, the latter being the most magnificent romanesque building in Silesia. It was planned after its mother church in Tyniec near Kraków, whereas its Westwork was influenced by Thuringian traditions. The church of the first Cistercian monastery in Lubiąż, built by monks from Pforta in Thuringia, was the first of many building made of brick in Silesia. The beginning of the 13th century was marked by a big increase in building activity, caused by the large influx of German settlers (Ostsiedlung). Most of the municipal churches in Silesia, built of stone or brick, emerged at that time. Examples were Głogów (Glogau), Nysa (Neiße), Jelenia Góra (Hirschberg) or Ziębice (Münsterberg). These late Romanesque Silesian churches were a mix of local, Saxon-Thuringian and Bohemian traditions. There are only seven known examples of that time in Upper Silesia, but 67 in Lower Silesia, including secular buildings.  Silesian Gothic  Wrocław Cathedral. Portico built by H. Berthold and P. Franzke between 1465 and 1468 The heralds of Gothic architecture were connected with the building activities of the Cistercians and the patronage of Henry I the Bearded. Two monasteries, in Trzebnica (Trebnitz) and in Henryków (Heinrichau), as well as two residences, in Wrocław and Legnica (Liegnitz), were early examples and referred to architectonic standards in Southern Germany and along the Rhine. They probably indicate to the dynastic connection between Henry I and the House of Andechs. Characteristic attributes of all these buildings were the combination of brick constructions and details made of stone, which were most likely brought in via Altzella in Saxony. Świdnica Cathedral by Lucas Schleierweber The Tatar invasions of 1241 led to the decentralization of Silesia. Baronial patronage decreased whereas episcopal and later municipal patronage increased. The most important construction project of that time was the cathedral of Wrocław, which became the first pure Gothic building in Silesia. The chapel St. Hedwig in Trzebnica was another important structure of that era. Both building cited early French traditions, imported via Saxony, Bohemia and Austria. Most mendicant orders built their monasteries in the second half of the 13th century, most notably in Wrocław, Głogów, Brzeg and Strzelin. At the same time the first hall churches appeared. The most original were in Ziębice and Złotoryja (Goldberg). Old Town Hall in Wrocław represents Saxon and Lusatian influences Silesia's towns needed approximately 50 years after foundation to get their independence. In the 14th century, many of these towns began to build their own big parish churches, and with the assistance of the new Bohemian sovereign a dynamic sacral development program began. Dominant were now Bohemian, Moravian, Southern German and Lower Austrian architectural traditions, but mixed with local traditions which preferred more simple forms. The most characteristic creation of the entire 14th century remained the basilical municipal church with a long nave and no transept. This style was most probably derived from the Cistercian abbey in Zlatá Koruna (Goldenkron) in Bohemia. Although Silesia was now a part of Bohemia, a state of the Holy Roman Empire, the Parler Gothic had almost no influence. Architectural embellishments can only be found in three churches, probably all built by master builder Claus Brynner. This dynamic sacral development program lasted the entire 14th century, and starting at around 1370 many bigger cities added guild and family chapels to their parish churches. At the end of the century, all monastery construction projects ended, and with the spreading of the Hussite Wars to Silesia most building activities were greatly reduced. The expansion of the town hall in Wrocław after 1480 marked a big change in the architectural history of Silesia. As it was obvious that local workshops, represented by Hans Berthold, could not meet the expectations, the city decided to invite experts from Saxony and Lusatia around master builder Paul Preusse. At the beginning of the new century, this influence from Saxony and Lusatia was most notably in western parts of Silesia, where Conrad Pflüger and Wendel Roskopf from Görlitz built city halls and churches in Löwenberg (Lwówek Śląski), Bunzlau (Bolesławiec), Sagan (Żagań) or Gröditzberg (Grodziec), all in the tradition of Benedikt Ried from Prague. Later Lucas Schleierweber from Schweidnitz (Świdnica) continued this Görlitz style and constructed buildings in other parts of Middle Silesia.  Renaissance and Mannerism  Brzeg Castle, one of the finest examples of Italian influenced Renaissance architecture in Silesia The Renaissance era began with the accession of Johann V. Thurzó as Bishop of Breslau. As a great patron of the arts he introduced the new style in Silesia as he commissioned two foundations plates (1505, 1509) at his residence in Jauernig (Javorník, today in the Czech Republic) and the sacristy portal (1517) on the cathedral in Breslau. The latter was probably made by a local artist, whereas most other early Renaissance projects were carried out by Italians from Ticino, the so- called \\"Comasks\\". The most successful were members of the Parr family (Pahr, Bahr or Pario), which built the fortifications in Bolkenhain (Bolków) in 1539 and later worked in Brieg. The oldest preserved Renaissance buildings today are house \\"To the golden crown\\" (1521–28) in Wrocław (demolished in 1906 and rebuilt after World War II) and the castle of Charles I, Duke of Münsterberg- Oels in Ząbkowice Śląskie (Frankenstein), built after 1524 by Benedikt Ried. Many buildings of that time still show the transition from Gothic to Renaissance, for instance the castle in Wojnowice (Wohnwitz) or the city halls in Bolesławiec (Bunzlau), Lwówek Śląski (Löwenberg) and Grodziec (Gröditzberg). Most of these buildings were probably built by Wendel Roskopf, a pupil of Benedikt Ried and author of a collection of exceptional Renaissance houses in Görlitz. He probably also was the constructor of Palais Rybisch in Wrocław, which was completed by an unnamed Italian artist after 1526. The gate of Płakowice Castle by Fr. Parr, showing Ramphold von Talkenberg, his wife and crests of several Silesian families The high building activity in the Middle Ages resulted in cities which were saturated with churches. Only in exceptional cases new churches were planned, for instance St. Blasius (today St. Maria) in Ohlau (Oława), carried out by Bernhard Niuron in 1587. At that time most Silesian churches became Protestant and the interest shifted to small alterations of church interiors. A great exception was the conversion of the medieval church in Rothsürben (Żórawina) by Hans Schneider, which resulted in one of the best examples of Protestant ecclesiastical architecture in Middle Europe. Much more coherent was the development of secular buildings. The first homogeneous Renaissance building was the gate of Legnica Castle, built 1533 by Georg von Amberg. The highlight of Silesian architecture of that time however represented Brzeg Castle and his castle gate, which is deemed to be the symbol of Silesian Renaissance. It was built between 1544–70 by Franziskus Parr, the figurative architectural sculptures, the biggest ensemble in Silesia, were carried out by Saxon master Andreas Walther d.Ä.. It depicts George II of Brieg, his wife Barbara von Brandenburg and his line of ancestors. It was most probably modeled after Dresden's Georgenhof, which Parr visited in 1530, and Italian designs. Similar buildings soon followed in Falkenberg (Niemodlin), Kreppelhof (Zamek Grodztwo) in Landeshut (Kamienna Góra), Sorau (Żary) and Plagwitz (Płakowice, now a district of Lwówek Śląski). Sgraffito appeared first in 1563 in Proskau (Proszków), altogether 300 examples are preserved to this day. Stylistically the early buildings were connected to Bohemian and Lusatian traditions, represented by Wendel Roskopf, Benedikt Ried and Hans Lindener and were still influenced by Gothic ideas. Soon afterwards the buildings of the Comasks from Italy replaced their work. After 1560 Dutch Renaissance styles, imported by pattern-books and master builders like Hans Vredeman de Vries, replaced Italian elements. These Dutch forms were first visible at Oleśnica Castle in 1542. Notable representatives of this era were Gaspare Cuneo, Gerhardt von Amsterdam and Hans Lucas. Buildings influenced by this style were the castles in Alt Warthau (Warta Bolesławiecka) or Gießmanndorf (Gościszów) and the majority of the civic architecture of that time. Sporadically, other traditions emerged too, for example Saxon portals in Liegnitz or Bohemian roofs in Grafenort (Gorzanów) castle. The only new development of sacred architecture in Silesia which fully adopted Mannerism was the palace chapel of Siedlisko (Carolath), commissioned by Valentin von Säbisch. His son Albrecht created the famous Protestant Churches of Peace, which were constrained by political conditions. Without tower, timber framed and built in minimal time they appeared more like commercial construction, a sparse look which was intended. In their simplicity they resembled on northern European Manierism, however they already were a creation of the baroque era.  Silesian Baroque  Main building of the University of Wrocław The beginning and the end of the Baroque were marked by two wars, the Thirty Years' War and the Seven Years' War. The triumph of the Baroque architecture in Silesia was closely connected to the rise of the House of Habsburg and the Counter-Reformation, whereas its decline was marked by the import of Classicism by Prussia, the new owner of Silesia after the Seven Years' War. The religious antagonism of Protestantism and Catholicism led to a sharp contrast of a conservative Protestant Baroque which was in the defence and a vanguard and rousing Catholic Baroque which was in the offensive. The ban to build Protestant churches and the saturation of the region with secular architecture resulted in a decline of building projects. As a consequence most Baroque palaces of the 17th and 18th century were alterations of existing structures. The destruction of the secular courtly culture by the new Polish owners after 1945 led to a widespread deterioration of palaces in Silesia, and today's remaining palaces and holdovers in museums give only a distorted impression of the Baroque era in Silesia. St. Hedwig's church in Legnickie Pole, 1727–31 by K. I. Dientzenhofer Important patrons of the Baroque architecture were two bishops from Breslau: Frederick of Hesse-Darmstadt and Franz Ludwig von Pfalz-Neuburg. During their 50-year incumbency both initiated numerous artistic projects and supported a large array of artists. Cistercian monasteries with their large possession acted as important intellectual and artistic centers, and Cistercian abbots used the arts as an instrument to manifest their prince-like status. They created the conditions for a collaboration of the two workshops of Michael Willmann and Matthias Steinl, which was of pan-European importance. The Jesuits as the main supporters of the imperial Counter-Reformation enriched mainly the civic centers with their buildings, much to the aversion of the Protestant society. They were responsible for the spread of basilicas modeled after Il Gisu, stylistic vocabulary of the Bohemian Dientzenhofer family and the baroque theatricalism found for instance at Leopoldina university in Breslau. Artistically very active were also the Premonstratensians, Augustinians, Franciscans and the Benedictines, the latter being responsible for the church at Wahlstatt (Legnickie Pole) near Liegnitz, an outstanding architectural monument and one of the most famous symbols of the triumph of the church against nonbelievers. The privileged higher Catholic nobility, often immigrated, at that time laid the base for large possessions, whereas the Protestant bourgeoisie lost its role as a patron of the architecture and compensated this loss with outstanding achievents in literature, music and science. Aula Leopoldina of the University of Wrocław, glorification of the Habsburg dynasty, emperor Leopold I., sculptures by Fr.J. Mangoldt, paintings Joh.Chr. Handke, 1731–33 Characteristic for the baroque era in Silesia was the glorification of the died out Silesian Piasts and its successors, the Habsburgs. The mother of the last ruling duke of the Silesian Piasts, princess Louise of Anhalt-Dessau, built a Piast mausoleum in Liegnitz commemorating the extinct dynasty, which shows a unique program by poet Daniel Casper von Lohenstein. The Cistercians regarded themselves as keepers of the Piastic legacy and erected commemorating programs in Leubus and Grüssau (Lubiąż and Krzeszów Abbeys), but also rendered homage to the Habsburgs at the university of Breslau, in Leubus and in Lobris (Luboradz). The early period of the baroque era (1640–80) was marked by the activity of Italian masters, which after the Thirty Years' War filled the gaps in the entire Holy Roman Empire. St. Matthias in Breslau (1654) and Cistercian churches like Grüssau (1670) were first altered, later it affected all churches. The first remodeled palaces (all around 1640) were the residences in Zülz (Biała Prudnicka), Żyrowa, Oberglogau (Głogówek), Palais Heberstein in Grafenort (Gorzanów) by Carlo Lurago (1653–57) and the palace in Proskau (Prószków) by G. Seregni between 1677-83. The palace in Sagan, started by Albrecht von Wallenstein and later in possession of the von Lobkowicz family, was modeled after Bohemian standards. The Jesuit seminar in Neisse (1656–58) was built by Melchior Werner, who represented the first generation of Silesian architects after the war. Church of Peace in Jawor, plans A.v. Säbisch, built by carpenter A. Gamper, painting probably G. Flegel, 1654–56 Important for the Protestant European architecture were the three Churches of Peace in Glogau, Jauer and Schweidnitz. Its constructor, military engineer Albrecht von Säbisch from Breslau, had to deal with a number of political constraints defined at the Peace of Westphalia. The churches should be built outside of the city walls, without stones and without a tower. The result were churches designed after Dutch and French examples, but with local traditions. A second variant of Protestant churches were so called border churches, simple buildings made of cheap materials, located outside of the borders of Silesia in the surrounding countries and used as refuges for the suppressed Silesian Protestants. Palace in Chocianów, 1728-32 by M. Frantz for Melchior Gottlob von Redern Between 1680 and 1740 the Silesian baroque entered a period of prosperity. The palace in Suhlau (Sułów), built in 1680, was the first building made with all representative stylistic elements of the baroque era. The Althans family constructed several palace ensembles in Wölfelsdorf (Wilkanów) and Mittelwalde (Międzylesie), Konrad Ernst Maximilian von Hochberg expanded castle Fürstenstein (Książ; 1718–25, carried out by F. A. Hammerschmidt and F. A. Scheffler), 10 years later Martin Frantz enlarged Kotzenau palace (Chocianów) and created one of the finest baroque garden in Silesia, and even some Palais entre cour et jardin emerged in Gröditzberg and Briese (by Johann Blasius Peintner from Austria). Entire landscape gardens however are rarely preserved and only known thanks to illustrations by Friedrich Bernhard Werner. Lubiąż Abbey, Princes' Hall with paintings by Ph. Chr. Bentum, sculptures by Fr. J. Mangoldt and plastering by I. A. Provisore, 1735-37 After 1680 all great Silesian monasteries were altered. Of special importance here is the abbey of Leubus with its famous representation rooms by Michael Willmann, F.A. Scheffler, Ph. Chr. Bentum and Franz Joseph Mangoldt. St. Elisabeth chapel at the cathedral of Breslau was the most significant import of Italian inspired baroque and the last major work carried out by Italians. 30 years later Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach created the pendant, the electors chapel, which already anticipated neo-classical ideas. The ideas of the Bohemian Baroque were spread by members of the Dientzenhofer family and its students. The first church of this type was the Jesuit church in Liegnitz, built by Christoph and Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer between 1714 and 1727. Later works can be found in Neiße, Liebenthal (Lubomierz), Leubus or Brieg. They were mostly propagated by Silesian Christoph Hackner from Jauer, Martin Frantz from Reval/Tallinn and his students Karl Martin Frantz and Johann Innocenz Töpper. Exaltation of the Holy Cross Church in Jelenia Góra, built 1707-18 by M. Frantz as the Grace Church (German: Gnadenkirche) A reason for the intensified construction activity in the first half of the 18th century was the implementation of the Treaty of Altranstädt, which demanded the restitution of 104 and the erection of 6 new Protestant churches, the so- called Gnadenkirchen (churches of mercy). The abolishment of building regulation except for the erection outside of the townwalls caused the heterogeneity of this group. The churches in Sagan, Freystadt (Kożuchów) and Militsch (Milicz) were timber-framed, the churches in Hirschberg and Landeshut by Martin Frantz modeled after Katarina Church in Stockholm, whereas the Protestant church in Teschen (Cieszyn, Český Těšín), modeled after Catholic Jesuit churches, was an exception. The biggest metropolitan ensembles were carried out in Neiße, Breslau and Liegnitz. Important palaces, which combined residential and professional requirements, in Breslau were built by the family von Hatzfeld, von Spätgen, Hornes and von Schreyvogel, the latter being designed by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. The biggest secular urban developments of that time were the Ritterakademie (knights academy) in Liegnitz, built for aristocratic children of both religious conviction, and the destroyed episcopalian spital in Neiße. Almost no city hall was constructed during the baroque era, and few saved their baroque rebuildings. Palace in Wodzisław Śląski from 1745 as the first neoclassical style object in Silesia The annexation by Prussia marked the beginning of the end of the Baroque era in Silesia. The orientation towards the new political and artistical center in Berlin brought changes in the organization of building activities along. New artists from Prussia took the place of dying Silesian artists (Tausch †1731, Peintner †1732, Hackner †1741, Frantz †1742, Frisch †1745), for instance G.L. Schirmeister in Oels (Oleśnica), J.M. Pohlmann in Oppeln (Opole) or Chr.Fr. Schultze in Breslau. The newly created building inspection department limited the importance of Silesian guilds and adjusted construction plans. Modest Protestant church in Primkenau (Polish: Przemków), drawn by Friedrich Bernhard Werner, church not preserved Between the First and Second Silesian War almost only magazines, barracks, fortification and Protestant churches were built. Towns like Cosel (Koźle, now a district of Kędzierzyn-Koźle), Brieg, Breslau, Glogau, Neiße and Schweidnitz were converted to fortresses. Carlsruhe (Pokój) was the first of a number of Frederician urban foundations, modelled after Karlsruhe in Baden. The liberated Protestant population built large quantities of modest churches in the first years of Prussian rule, which were portrayed by Friedrich Bernhard Werner. The most prestigious project of that time was the construction of the castle church in Breslau, which was remodelled by Carl Gotthard Langhans and became the prototype of all later classical Protestant churches. The final say of the Catholics in Silesia was the monastery complex of the Cistercians in Grüssau (1774–90). The symbol of the changes and the first palace construction after the second half of the 18th century became the royal residence in Breslau (1750-53 by Joh. Boumann d.Ä.), which integrated the palace of the family von Spätgen and was a mix of Frederician rococo and classical components. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, commander of Frederick's army, erected a Maison de plaisance in Minkowsky (Minkowskie) which was akin to Sanssouci, and the palace of family von Maltzan in Militsch was modeled after the New Palace in Potsdam.  Neoclassicism and Historicism  Neoclassical evangelical church in Syców, 1785 by K. G. Langhans After the Treaty of Hubertusburg, a long-lasting phase of political and economic stabilization led to building activities which lasted until the defeat of Prussia in 1806. The destroyed cities were rebuilt, Upper Silesia became industrialized and many defensive fortifications were put up. In 1775 Silesia was split into two separate construction departments, Breslau and Glogau, which were headed by fully independent construction managers (Oberbaudirektoren). The most important of these managers, Karl Gotthard Langhans, developed its own unique neo-classical style, which was of European importance. The sacral architecture was now dominated by the Protestant church. After 1763 the small modest churches of the past were gradually abandoned and large monumental churches were built. Groundbreaking for the development of these churches were the churches in Cosel by Joh.M. Pohlmann and K.G. Langhans and in Polnisch Wartenberg (Syców) by K.G. Langhans in 1785. The new standards of these neo- classical churches were soon adopted by the churches in Waldenburg (Wałbrzych), Reichenbach (Dzierżoniów) and Münsterberg (Ziębice). The building activities of the Catholic Church stagnated until the mid 19th century. Wrocław Opera House by Carl Ferdinand Langhans, 1839-41 The residential architecture between 1740 and 1806 was marked by dynamic changes regarding styles and types. New town palaces however were rarely built. The most important one was Palais Hatzfeldt in Breslau, one of the first neo-classical buildings in Europe, designed in 1764 by I. Ganevale and K.G. Langhans. Other palaces adopted the new style after 1770. The public initiatives affected mainly military buildings: monumental fortifications in Silberberg (Fort Srebrna Góra), Neiße and Glatz (Kłodzko Fortress) as well as new barracks in Breslau and Brieg. According to the welfare policy of Frederick II of Prussia new hospitals and workhouses were erected (Kreuzburg, Breslau), and with the beginning industrialization of Upper Silesia entire residential developments were planned. New administration structures were adopted after the Prussian ministry for Silesia was closed in 1808 and the reforms by Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg were implemented. From now on every building project had to be accepted by the building inspection department, which itself was under the control of the royal police headquarters. Every town appointed its municipal architect and local building deputation controlled the technical aspects of every project. These principles were in effect until 1900. After 1820 positive results of these reforms became visible as a new period of building activity began. Most of these activities were now carried out in the cities, which became dominant in the shaping of Silesia's architectural landscape. Dozens of theaters, houses for different associations, schools, hospitals or asylums were built. The most important artistical center was Breslau, and the most important Silesian architect until 1840 was Carl Ferdinand Langhans, son of Carl Gotthard and creator of the exchange, the theater, the loge \\"Friedrich zum goldenen Zepter\\" in Breslau and the theater in Liegnitz. A new type of apartment buildings began to evolve and the rich bourgeoisie began to live in large villas at the outskirts of the cities. Von Hoym Mausoleum in the park of the palace in Brzeg Dolny, by Gr. Gilly, 1800-03 The architecture of that time was marked by a broad mix of several neo-classical styles, from Palladianism, revolutionary Neoclassicism (Hoym mausoleum by Friedrich Gilly) in Dyhernfurth (Brzeg Dolny) or Palais Hohenlohe with the construction of the palace in Kamenz by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Summer residences for the king of Prussia and his court in Hirschberg valley were the most important phenomenon in the palace architecture, where more than 30 palaces, castles and manors formed a cultural landscape of outstanding importance. In the cities the town walls were razed (first 1807 in Breslau) and replaced by greens, among them the first public parks. The fourth decade of the 19th century was a turning point in the history of the Silesian architecture. Frederick William IV of Prussia ascended the throne in 1840, Karl Friedrich Schinkel died in 1841 and Karl Ferdinand Langhans finally moved to Berlin. Neo-Classizism was slowly replaced by Historism, the Silesian architecture linked more and more with Berlin and with the rise of the Wilhelmine empire the local architecture became fully dominated by German art movements. Neo-Renaissance was soon adopted in two varieties, Italian and Northern- German, the latter being promoted as the \\"national style\\". This German Renaissance was mainly used at state-run building projects, for instance post offices. Palaces and self-governments were often built in neo- Baroque forms, whereas neo- Romanic did not became popular in Silesia. Synagogue \\"Am Anger\\" (Polish: \\"Na Wygonie\\") in Wrocław by Edwin Oppler, 1872 The departure of Karl Ferdinand Langhans left a gap which was soon filled by architects from Berlin. The time until 1914 was now marked by a peculiar rivalry between the architects from Silesia and Berlin. Communal and private building projects carried out by Silesian architects clearly cited local traditions, whereas governmental building projects dominated by architects from Berlin showed stylistic concepts without Silesian characteristics. The state (king, emperor) became the client with the most prestige, on his initiative many administrational buildings (regional councils, archives), prisons, courts of justice, police buildings and academies were constructed. As the leader of the Protestant church the king also founded many churches. The Catholic Church was still one of the biggest principals, especially in Upper Silesia. In 1883 a bishopric building officer was created, the first one being Josef Ebers. Not only churches were erected, but also hospitals, schools and many other buildings; approximately 2.000 Protestant and Catholic institutions in the entire 19th century. After 1850 the Jews became the third important ecclesiastic client and built large and representative synagogues which rivaled the churches of the other denominations. The most spectacular example was the synagogue \\"Am Anger\\" in Breslau, constructed by Edwin Oppler in 1872. They also built many hospitals and care homes. The religious equalization of Protestants, Catholics and Jews, which was typical für the second half of the 19th century in Prussia, was now mirrored by the architectural landscape of Silesia. Gieschewald (Polish: Giszowiec), workers colony, by Georg and Emil Zillmann Thanks to the Prussian reforms in the beginning of the 19th century the bourgeoisie became the dominant group and replaced the patriciate, which partially left their town palaces and concentrated on big industrial investments in Upper Silesia. The bourgeoisie also became the foremost patrons and consumers of the arts and initiated the construction of many theaters, museums or galleries, in addition they also gave an impetus to the beautification of the cities with parks and promenades. Their biggest achievement however was the construction of countless apartment buildings, which led to a rapid growth of the cities and the transition of Breslau to a metropolis. At the same time the division of the suburbs into living spaces for workmen, craftsmen, industry and rich middle classes took place. This however occurred only in Lower Silesia. Most towns in Upper Silesia did not have an old town center but often only one street, and they also did not have suburbs but chaotically scattered small apartment buildings for workers (so called familoki), which were closely connected to the local coal mines. An exception was the workers colony in Nickischschacht and especially Gieschewald, built by Berlin architects Georg and Emil Zillmann for Gesellschaft Georg v. Giesche's Erben. Gerhart Hauptmann Villa The opposite to the Upper Silesian industrial small towns represented the Lower Silesian spas in the Sudetes mountain range. Silesia was without a doubt scenically the most beautiful part of the Kingdom of Prussia, which was the reason for the speedy development of several railway lines to the spas at the foothill of the mountains in the second half of the 19th century. These villages and towns, with its exclusive sanatoriums and hotels, were a prestigious field of work for architects from Breslau, but some of them, like Görbersdorf (the Silesian Davos), were also carried out by non- Silesians like Edwin Oppler from Hanover (although he was born in Silesia). After the royal court left Hirschberg valley (which is also a part of the Sudetes) the region became attractive for a number of famous people from the German intelligentsia, among them Nobel Prize winner Gerhart Hauptmann, whose villa in Agnetendorf (Jagniątków) was designed by one of the best architects from Berlin, Hans Grisebach, or political economist Werner Sombart, who resided in a villa in Schreiberhau by Fritz Schumacher from Hamburg.

John Harrison published in 2002. It received the James Tiptree, Jr. Award and a BSFA nomination in 2002, and was shortlisted for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2003. The Guardian ranked Light #91 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century. Overview The book centres on the lives of three individuals — the physicist (and serial killer) Michael Kearney, on the verge of a breakthrough in theoretical physics sometime in 1999; Seria Mau Genlicher, the cybernetically-altered female pilot of a \\"K-ship\\", and the ex-space pilot and adventurer Ed Chianese. Seria Mau and Ed's stories take place in the year 2400 AD. The lives of these three individuals are linked in many ways, though most tangibly by the presence of a mysterious creature called The Shrander, who appears in many guises to all three characters throughout the novel (with anagrammatic names of Sandra Shen and Dr. Haends). They are also linked by the Kefahuchi Tract, a space-time anomaly described as \\"a singularity without an event horizon\\", an object of awe and wonder that has been the ruin of many civilisations attempting to decode its mysteries. The Shrander takes many forms, most often with the body of an old woman in a maroon wool coat, with a horse's skull for a head which may be similar to its original form. Harrison appears to have taken his inspiration for this strange entity from the legend of the Mari Lwyd, a creature with a horse's skull for a head, bedecked in ribbons, that features in the ancient folklore of Gwent and Glamorgan. Elements of Light originally surfaced in Harrison's short fiction, particularly the stories \\"The Horse of Iron and How We Can Know It\\" and \\"The Incalling\\". The former contains prototypes of the Shrander and Kearney characters, whilst the latter deals with the Sprakes, a clan of dubious urban magicians. Both stories are available in the collected volume of Harrison's short fiction, Things That Never Happen. Characters =Michael Kearney strand (1999 AD)= Michael Kearney: A 40-year-old physicist and serial killer. Plagued by hallucinations of - or visitations from - a mysterious entity he calls \\"The Shrander\\". Brian Tate: Kearney's research partner, whose dedication to his research into the physics of \\"decoherence free space\\" is eroding his marriage and, possibly, his sanity. Kearney and Tate's research ultimately paves the way for humanity to explore space. Anna Kearney: Kearney's ex-wife, a psychologically brittle, (though eternally optimistic) woman of 40. When the novel begins, she is in a relationship, but the impromptu arrival of her ex-husband destroys this, and she and Michael begin their relationship again. Valentine Sprake: A street drunk who first meets Kearney on an overground train, and guesses his terrible secret. The two become partners in magic and crime; it is hinted that Sprake has prophetic abilities, and his sister describes him as \\"one of the five most powerful magicians in London\\", a claim which Kearney mocks. =Seria Mau strand (2400 AD)= Seria Mau Genlicher: Seria Mau signed up to Earth Military Contracts at the age of 13, whereupon she was cybernetically fused to her K-ship, the White Cat. She subsequently went rogue and became a freelance assassin. Though she is in control of a ship of devastating capabilities, Seria Mau has not matured emotionally, and is prone to fits of murderous rage, lust and caprice. Uncle Zip: A \\"tailor\\" (gene manipulator) based on the planet Motel Splendido, who deals in dubious merchandise. It is he who tells Seria Mau where she might find the space pilot Billy Anker. Mona the Clone: A vain, empty-headed young woman who boards the White Cat with a team of salvagers. When they are killed, Seria Mau takes pity on her and allows her to live on board, though their relationship is fraught. It is heavily implied that \\"Mona\\" is one of the most common and fashionable \\"looks\\" for women in the galaxy, and the novel is filled with numerous versions of her. Billy Anker: A decrepit \\"entradista\\" whom Seria Mau meets, rescues, and later murders. A daredevil pilot in his youth, he is a clone of Uncle Zip. =Ed Chianese strand (2400 AD)= Ed Chianese: A thrill-seeker, adventurer and \\"twink\\" (Virtual Reality addict) who finds work as a \\"futurist\\" (essentially a performing oracle) at a circus run by Sandra Shen. Evie and Bella Cray: The Cray Sisters are notorious gangsters, to whom Ed owes money. Their hunt for him wrenches Ed from his various addictions and towards his true destiny. Tig Vesicle: A \\"new man\\", one of a curious race of aliens who invaded Earth centuries ago. He and his wife Neena hide Ed when he is on the run. Annie Glyph: a \\"rickshaw girl\\", genetically modified for the strength and speed required for long shifts pulling a rickshaw. Ed saves her life, and the two of them embark on an affair. Reception Regina Schroeder in review for Booklist described the novel as \\"sometimes space opera, sometimes a kind of noir fiction, Harrison’s novel is a cleverly assembled contemplation of how choices make lives and of opening quantum mechanical doors on bizarre potential futures.\\" Publishers Weekly said that \\"this is space opera for the intelligentsia, as Harrison...tweaks aspects of astrophysics, fantasy and humanism to hum right along with the blinking holograms in a welcome and long overdue return.\\" Kirkus Reviews said this novel was a \\"profoundly thoughtful, complex, fascinating, and sometimes bewildering mosaic. Does it all add up? Well, objectively speaking, not altogether--and perhaps that's the point.\\" References and allusions The novel is replete with references to Harrison's many interests - mountaineering, rock music, etc. In many ways, this is fitting for a novel that is, in part, about human beings and their endless capacity for re-use and re-invention. Song lyrics, references to old TV shows and numerous other allusions are dropped into the narrative at various points. There are at least two allusions to the world of mountaineering in the book: the cruiser named Touching the Void and the remark by Chianese that \\"You don't get the tick unless you come back\\". There are also several references to The Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester, most notably the borrowed line about the vacuum of space \\"smelling of lemons\\". One character is named Otto Rank, presumably after the psychoanalyst. Seria Mau Genlicher's name is almost certainly a reference to Sarah Michelle Gellar, and at one point Kearney's partner Brian Tate reflects on watching reruns of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Several of the chapters are also named after rock songs or albums. Agents of Fortune is an album by Blue Öyster Cult, and \\"Tumbling Dice\\" is named after the Rolling Stones song. In addition, the street gang who are assigned to find Ed Chianese in New Venusport are called The Skeleton Keys of the Rain, after a Bob Dylan lyric. The Shadow Operators, ghosts of old code who congregate in human ships, are apt to quote old song lyrics, including Joe Jackson's \\"Is She Really Going Out with Him?\\". There are also references to old BBC TV shows, particularly in the trash-talk exchanged between Seria Mau and the other K-Captain, Krishna Moire. Seria Mau, upon firing a missile at Moire's pod of ships, declares \\"Here's one I made earlier\\", a catchphrase from Blue Peter, and Moire later responds with \\"It's goodnight from me. And a fucking goodnight to you\\", a profane parody of one of the catchphrases of The Two Ronnies. London locations Many real London locations are utilised; Anna Kearney's flat is in Grove Park, near Chiswick; Kearney and Brian Tate's laboratory is in Bloomsbury; the offices of the venture capitalist that Tate sells his and Kearney's research to (and whom Kearney subsequently murders) is in Walthamstow, Kearney's private members club is in Greek Street, Soho; and Valentine Sprake and his family live in Kilburn. It is here where Kearney finds Sprake dead. Kearney first encounters The Shrander at Charing Cross, and meets a homeless woman who may or may not be her in Soho Square. Anna Kearney also follows Michael, at a distance, from Hammersmith, through Victoria to West Croydon, whereupon they discover the ultimate fate of Brian Tate. The other strands often refer tangentially to Kearney's London; for instance, the backwater planet on which Seria Mau temporarily strands Mona the Clone is situated in a star system called Perkins' Rent, named after a street near Victoria. Sequels Harrison wrote a sequel, Nova Swing, which was published in 2006. Set a generation after the events of Light, it deals with characters alluded to in the first novel, including Liv Hula, who \\"flew dipships\\" with Ed Chianese.

It lies at the northern foot of Wolstonbury Hill and may be regarded as one of the finest stately houses in Sussex, with 56 bedrooms and 28 apartments. The present house was built 1593–95 by George Goring, on the site of an older house. It is set in eight acres (32,000 m²) of gardens at the foot of the South Downs within an historic parkland of some 400 acres, which was granted by royal charter in 1333. Etymology The name Danny may be a corruption of the Saxon Dane(g)hithe, meaning 'valley and haven'. History =Pre-Roman= The outline of a Bronze Age enclosure exists above Danny House on the top of nearby Wolstonbury Hill (now owned by the National Trust and within the South Downs National Park). On the west side of Wolstonbury there is a large artificial plateau thought to be the site of an Iron Age camp. =Roman times= The Sussex Greensand Way Roman road passed through the site of Danny Park in an east-west direction, making an alignment change on the hill to the north of the house. The road survives as a terrace on the shoulder of the hill, a hollow way leading down the hill and a raised strip leading to the stream. A Roman pottery kiln has been found south of the road.I D Margary, Roman Ways in the Weald Phoenix House, Revised 1965 pp171-2 =Domesday Book= The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that 'Robert holds Herst of William', i.e. that Robert de Pierpoint held the land from William de Warenne, who was a son-in-law of William the Conqueror. =13th century= There has been a house of some sort on this site since the 13th century, originally little more than a hunting-lodge, when the medieval Park of Danny was enclosed by the last Sir Simon de Pierpoint in 1343 =Late 16th century= The house in its present form dates from the early sixteenth century but was reconstructed and enlarged by George Goring in 1593, after he had purchased the estate in 1582. It was designed in the shape of the letter E to represent the Queen (Elizabeth I of England) who had been on the throne for over 30 years at the commencement of the reconstruction work. The house represents a fine example of Elizabethan architecture. The current house has two main fronts, the east 16th Century, the south early Georgian. The brick-built east frontage is monumental, the south front stately, the whole building a prominent element in views from the downs. It stands to three storeys. Danny =Mid 17th century= After four generations of Gorings, Danny was sold to Peter Courthope in 1650. In 1652 Danny Great Park was 54 ha (135 acres) with arable land and meadow amounting to about 170 ha (420 acres). The parkland still contains large, noble oaks of varying ages and growth patterns and is used today for a variety of recreational activities. In 1702, Barbara Courthope married Henry Campion, and in 1725 they made Danny their home, and soon undertook extensive alterations, including the re-fronting of the south side of the house as is confirmed by the date 1728 and their initials on the leaden water-pipes. Several generations of Campions followed. = The world’s earliest cricket ground = Cricket is recorded in the Thomas Marchant’s diaries as having been played at Sand Field, Danny Park in 1717. This makes Sand Field the earliest identifiable cricket ground in the world. In July 2017, the tri-centenary of the occasion was celebrated by a match played between Danny House and Hurstpierpoint Cricket Club. =War Cabinet= During World War I, Danny was rented for four months to Prime Minister Lloyd George, where he lived here in a menage a trois with his wife Margaret and his secretary and mistress Frances Stevenson. Regular meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet were held in the Great Hall, where on 13 October 1918 terms of the armistice to be offered to Germany at the end of the Great War were decided, and authority was given to US President Woodrow Wilson to negotiate the Armistice. There were some letters, written at Danny, from Lloyd George to Frances Stevenson, one of which read: \\"My darling Pussy. You might phone from the Treasury on Friday if you can come. Don't let Hankey see you. If Saturday impossible, what about Monday? Fondest love to my own.\\" D. (Hankey was then Cabinet Secretary). =Recent history= Soon after the war Danny House became a school, firstly known as Montpelier College and then Wolstonbury College, which had been transferred from Brighton, but this closed down in 1956. Although the Campion family were no longer residing in the house, the estate continued in the ownership of the Campions until the 1980s when the estate was broken up and the various land holdings, houses and farms were sold to tenants or into private hands. The house was then bought by Mutual Households Association (later the Country Houses Association). After the CHA went into liquidation in 2003,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3319953.stm the house was bought by a private purchaser in 2004. In 2007, Danny House celebrated 50 years as a retirement home.

Available at Project Gutenberg. The theater was a stone building owned by the Venetian Tron family, and took its name from the neighbourhood where it was located, the parish of San Cassiano near the Rialto. It was considered 'public' as it was directed by an impresario, or general manager, for the paying public rather than for nobles exclusively. History The original theater, the first public theatre for spoken plays, was built in 1581. This structure succumbed to fire in 1629, and was soon after rebuilt by the owner, the Tron family. The first operas of the commercially run venture were L'Andromeda and La Maga Fulminata. These were produced in 1637 and 1638 respectively, by Benedetto Ferrari and Francesco Manelli. Ferrari and company stayed until 1639 when the business was acquired by a new company managed by entrepreneur Francesco Caletti-Bruni, with financial backing from Venetian nobleman Cavalli. Caletti-Bruni composed most of the operas performed here in the six years from 1639 to 1645. After the 1650s the theater was surpassed by others, and its number of performances declined. Impresario Marco Faustini managed the Teatro San Cassiano from 1657 to 1660. Towards the end of the 17th century, Venice became the opera capital of the world as another ten opera houses had opened. At this point the Teatro San Cassiano could count first performances of 37 operas. The last performances were held in 1807 and it was demolished in 1812, mainly due to recurring fires. The operatic period dramma in musica coincided with the early years of the commercial San Cassiano and was influenced by its composers.

Plot synopsis The novel is set in the fictional Massachusetts town of Durham shortly after World War I. The Pentland family is rich and part of the upper class, but their world is rapidly changing. The old Congregational church the Pentlands long favored has disbanded as more and more WASPs have left Durham, replaced by immigrant Roman Catholics with very different religious customs. The Pentlands once ruled upper-class society in Durham, and still do. But even upper-class society is changing: Many of the \\"old line\\" families have either died off or moved away, while many nouveau riche have moved into the area who do not share the same old-fashioned values and observe the same old-fashioned norms of behavior that the Pentlands do. The patriarch of the family is old John Pentland. He lives in Pentland Manor, a large and old-fashioned manor house, with his sister, Cassie. Cassie is a fussy, moralistic, snobbish old maid who sticks her nose into everybody's business and who is firmly determined to see that the Pentlands uphold the \\"old ways.\\" Her companion is Miss Peavey, who lacks intelligence but in all other ways is as moralistic and disapproving as Aunt Cassie. John's son and heir, Anson, married the wealthy but low-status Scotch-Irish girl Olivia. The couple have a son, John (nicknamed \\"Jack\\") and a daughter, Sybil. The Pentlands say that they can trace their family heritage back to the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and Anson is writing a book about the family. John Pentland's niece, Sabine, is the black sheep of the family. Her parents died, and her home was lost to creditors. She became Aunt Cassie's ward. But twenty years ago, she married a poor, low-born man named Callender and fled with him to Europe. John Pentland acts as if he is widowed, but about a quarter of the way through the novel the reader realizes that his wife is not dead. For the past two or three decades, Pentland's wife Agnes has been insane, and now lives in an upstairs room in a far wing of the house. She is cared for by a nurse, Miss Egan. Every morning, John Pentland visits her and speaks with her despite her insanity. Afterward, he visits Mrs. Soames, a long-time friend of his wife's, and plays cards. His attention to the widowed Mrs. Soames is unseemly (so Aunt Cassie says), but no one can openly criticize him for it as John Pentland is the patriarch of the family. The novel is set during the early autumn. Olivia is almost 40 years old, and she increasingly feels trapped and stifled by her life. She and her husband have a loveless marriage (they have not shared rooms for years), and their son Jack is constantly ill. The novel opens as Olivia's daughter, Sybil, returns home from a boarding school in Paris. Sabine Callender and her daughter, Therese, have also returned to Durham and are spending the summer at Pentland Manor. Therese is a débutante, and is being \\"introduced\\" to Durham upper-class society. Aunt Cassie and Miss Peavey repeatedly criticize Sabine for being a flapper and for the scandal she brought down on the family. Also visiting Durham that fall is Jean, the son of a Frenchman who married an American woman and who Sybil met in Paris. Sybil is in love with Jean, and creates scandal by pursuing him relentlessly. Also newly arrived in Durham is Michael O'Hara, an Irish immigrant who has achieved wealth and political prominence in Boston. He bought Sabine's former home and is refurbishing it. Aunt Cassie and Miss Peavey are horrified by the arriviste and constantly snub him. Anson is upset by the attentions O'Hara lavishes on his wife and daughter. O'Hara soon tells Sabine that he has fallen in love with Olivia, and Olivia reciprocates. O'Hara says he is willing to sacrifice everything just to love her. Anson Pentland, meanwhile, refuses to give Olivia a divorce for fear it will ruin his career and the family's good name. Several events happen in quick succession: Jack dies, but only Olivia is there to comfort him at the end. Olivia discovers the Pentland groom is having a secret affair with someone in the house. (The reader realizes it is the nurse, Miss Egan.) The night Jack dies, Olivia runs into a momentarily-lucid Mrs. Pentland, who tells her that there is a secret in the attic which could not only destroy but also free the family. (She is quickly hushed by Miss Egan, and soon falls back into muddled incomprehensibility.) Sybil marries Jean, and Olivia is convinced her daughter will find the happiness that she has never had. Several secrets are revealed by the end of the novel, which mark the Pentlands as hypocrites. Olivia learns that John Pentland loves Mrs. Soames (whether he has consummated his affair with her is unclear), and has not divorced his insane wife out of duty. His daily visits with his wife are not performed out of love (as everyone assumes) but out of a desire to divert attention from his affair with Mrs. Soames. Olivia comes to believe that Mrs. Pentland's ravings about a secret in the attic were not madness. She soon discovers a packet of letters that reveals that the Pentland family's ancestor was a bastard child who stole the name from an aristocratic family that had died shortly after arriving in the New World. She suspects Anson knows the truth, and is lying about the family in his book. John Pentland, broken-hearted at the death of his grandson, changes his will and leaves all his money to Olivia. He commits suicide by riding his horse into a deep ravine and falling to his death. Olivia rejects Michael O'Hara's love, realizing that she is the only person strong enough to hold the Pentland family together through the coming years of immense change. John Pentland has given her the chance, through her control of the family fortune, to force the Pentlands to adapt rather than die off like so many other upper- class families have. By leaving with Michael, Olivia believes that she would be taking the easy way out and actually cheapening herself.

He served as a general of the Jacobite army in the 1715 Uprising and subsequently fled to France. Early life Forster was baptized on 29 March 1683, the eldest son of Thomas Forster (1659-1725) of Adderstone, MP for Northumberland from 1705 to 1708. His mother was Frances Forster, daughter of Sir William Forster of Bamburgh Castle. He was educated at Newcastle School, and was admitted at St John's College, Cambridge on 3 July 1700. In 1701, he inherited, with his aunt Dorothy Crew (wife of Lord Crew, Bishop of Durham) the estates of his uncle Ferdinando Forster, of Bamburgh and Blanchland. The estates had incurred substantial debts, and in 1704 the creditors instituted actions in Chancery to force the heirs to sell them. Career Forster was returned as Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Northumberland at the 1708 British general election. In 1709 he and his aunt, sold the indebted estates to his aunt's husband, Bishop Crewe, and were left with very little of the proceeds. In 1710 he voted against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. At the 1710 British general election he was returned again himself for Northumberland in a contest and tried unsuccessfully to return Tory candidates at Berwick-upon-Tweed and Morpeth. He was listed as one of the ‘Tory patriots’ who had opposed the continuation of the war, and one of the ‘worthy patriots’ who had helped to detect the mismanagements of the previous ministry. He supported the efforts of the Earl of Hertford and James Lowther, both Whigs, in carrying forward a bill to regulate trade on the border with Scotland. On 18 June 1713, he voted in favour of the French commerce bill. He was returned again at the 1713 British general election but was inactive in Parliament. He was returned as MP for Northumberland at the 1715 British general election but his activities were diverted into supporting the Jacobite cause. Jacobite rebellion and exile The Forsters were cousins to the Radcliffes. The head of the family Lord Derwentwater, himself a cousin of the Old Pretender, was a leader of the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion. Forster met up with Lord Derwentwater in Northumberland at the head of 300 horse, and proclaimed the Pretender at Warkworth after evading arrest in London on 21 September 1715 on a charge of being ‘engaged in a design to support the intended invasion of the kingdom’. After an unsuccessful attempt on Newcastle he joined another body of rebels north of the border and a detachment from Mar's army. Although having no military experience, Forster, as a Protestant, was elected to lead all Jacobite forces in England. Under his direction Lancelot Errington captured the island of Lindisfarne. Forster relied on advice from Henry Oxburgh, an Irish former soldier. The Jacobites moved southwest from Northumberland into Lancashire, but were faced with converging forces of the British Army under Charles Wills and George Carpenter. In November 1715 Forster was heavily defeated at the Battle of Preston and surrendered. He was imprisoned in Newgate Prison, but escaped to France in 1716. The details of his escape and the text of the royal proclamation ordering his arrest were published by the contemporary commentator Boyer (1716).Boyer, Abel, Political State of Great Britain, Volume IX, London, 1716, pp.387-90 Proclamation for apprehending Thomas Forster He was attainted and expelled from Parliament on 2 February 1716. Several of his former comrades including Derwentwater and Oxburgh were executed. Forster managed to reach Paris, where he was sent money by William Dicconson, the Pretender's treasurer. He then joined the English Jacobites at the Stuart court, where he was made steward of the Household. He had been excepted from the Act of Indemnity, and his brother John succeeded to Adderstone in 1725. His nephew Thomas remarked, in correspondence, that he held out ‘little hopes’ of his ‘getting anything from the succession’. After the Pretender moved to Avignon from Rome he summoned Forster there in October 1727. Death and legacy Forster died unmarried in Boulogne, France on 27 October 1738, aged 55. His body, after being initially buried at Boulogne, was returned to England and reburied at Bamburgh on 7 December. Physical description Forster was described as follows in the 1716 royal proclamation ordering his arrest: A person of middle stature, inclining to be fat, well shaped except that he has stoops in the shoulders, fair complexioned, his mouth wide, his nose pretty large, his eyes grey, speaks the northern dialect\\".

History In 1257 the local lord Rostislav Mikhailovich was crowned as Tsar of Bulgaria in Tarnovo, but soon withdrew to Vidin. By early 1290s Serbia expanded towards the vicinity of Vidin. Threatened by Serbian expansion, Shishman failed to repel the brothers forces, and accepted Serbian suzerainty.The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism by D. Hupchick, page 88 Serbian rule lasted until Serbian king Stefan Milutin´s death, in 1321. As Milutin left no testament, after his death, in Serbia occurred a period of civil war with Stefan Dečanski, Stefan Konstantin and Stefan Vladislav II fighting for power. Shishman took advantage of this situation, set free from Serbian rule, and returned to Bulgarian orbit. In 1323 Shishman was chosen to be Bulgarian tsar. Shishman made an anti-Serbian treaty with the Byzantines, however, after Serbian victory over Bulgarians in the Battle of Velbazhd in 1330, Bulgaria lay militarily crippled and politically subordinated to Serbia's interests.The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism by D. Hupchick, page 89 In 1356, Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander isolated Vidin from the Bulgarian monarchy and appointed his son Ivan Stratsimir (1356–1396) as absolute ruler of the domain of Vidin. In 1365, the state was occupied by Hungarian crusaders, but the occupation was short-lived. Although the initial campaign was not entirely successful because the Hungarians seized the city back, the ensuing negotiations between the Kingdom of Hungary and Ivan Alexander's allies, Vladislav I Vlaicu and Dobrotitsa, the despot of the semi-independent Dobrujan Principality of Karvuna, led to the return of the city to Bulgarian possession. It is thought that Ivan Sratsimir was reinstalled as the region's ruler in the autumn of 1369. In 1393 the whole of Bulgaria, along with the rest of the surrounding region, fell to the Ottoman Empire. This brought an end to Bulgaria's medieval state empire. Vidin was now the only region controlled by the indigenous Bulgarian population and not the invading Ottoman Turks. The Ottomans went on to conquer the despotates of Dobruja, Prilep and Velbazhd as well. Vidin's independence did not last long. In 1396, Stratsimir contributed soldiers to assist the Christian nations' bid to overturn the Ottoman Empire. Following defeat at the hands of the Ottomans outside the city of Nicopolis, Vidin finally fell under the sphere of the Ottomans led by Bayezid I.A Concise History Of Bulgaria, Cambridge Concise Histories, R.

At the center point of the monkey saddle the Gauss curvature is 0, otherwise negative. For a surface in three dimension the focal surface, surface of centers or evolute is formed by taking the centers of the curvature spheres, which are the tangential spheres whose radii are the reciprocals of one of the principal curvatures at the point of tangency. Equivalently it is the surface formed by the centers of the circles which osculate the curvature lines.David Hilbert, Stephan Cohn-Vossen: Anschauliche Geometrie, Springer-Verlag, 2011, , p. 197.Morris Kline: Mathematical Thought From Ancient to Modern Times, Band 2, Oxford University Press, 1990, A surface with an elliptical umbilic, and its focal surface. A surface with a hyperbolic umbilic and its focal surface. As the principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form, there are two at each point, and these give rise to two points of the focal surface on each normal direction to the surface. Away from umbilical points, these two points of the focal surface are distinct; at umbilical points the two sheets come together. When the surface has a ridge the focal surface has a cuspidal edge, three such edges pass through an elliptical umbilic and only one through a hyperbolic umbilic. At points where the Gaussian curvature is zero, one sheet of the focal surface will have a point at infinity corresponding to the zero principal curvature. If \\\\vec p is a point of the given surface, \\\\vec n the unit normal and k_1,k_2 the principal curvatures at \\\\vec p, then : \\\\vec b_1(\\\\vec p)=\\\\vec p+\\\\frac{\\\\vec n}{k_1} \\\\quad and \\\\quad \\\\vec b_2(\\\\vec p)=\\\\vec p+\\\\frac{\\\\vec n}{k_2}\\\\ are the corresponding two points of the focal surface.

Although born in Pampanga, he grew up in Tondo, Manila where he started his checkered career playing in sandlot tournaments and for Abad Santos High School in Manila. At 5'10½\\" tall, he was first spotted in an interscholastic tournament by Valerio Lopez of Mapua where he subsequently enrolled. He eventually shone in the NCAA and the MICAA, playing for such teams as the Jacinto Rubber Shoes, Crispa (where he became one of the pioneering members of that team) and YCO. Known as the \\"Bad Boy\\" of Philippine basketball because of his unforgiving and physical defense, Badion popularized the moves that came to be known as the \\"bicycle drive\\" and the \\"jackknife layup,\\" moves which young players tried to imitate during the 1950s. In the commercial leagues, Badion played for the original batch of the Crispa Redmanizers in the Businessman's Athletic Association (BAA) and the YCO Painters in the Manila Industrial Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA). He starred for the Philippine national team in two Olympic tournaments and the 1958 Asian Games where he and his teammates won the gold medal. He was also a vital cog of the national team that finished seventh in a 15-nation men's basketball tournament in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, playing alongside the likes of Carlos Loyzaga, Antonio Genato, Ramon Campos Jr., Ramon Manulat, Martin Urra and Mariano Tolentino. Voted Mr. Basketball by the Philippine Sportswriters Association eventually made a movie with the same title together with actor Bob Soler in 1957, Badion was also a mainstay of the team that won the inaugural staging of the Asian Basketball Confederation Championship held in Manila in 1960 together with Loyzaga, Kurt Bachmann, Loreto Carbonell, and Eduardo Lim. He was named to the All-Star team with Loyzaga and Most Valuable Player of the said tournament. Unfortunately, Badion suffered a serious knee injury during the Philippines' first-round game against Uruguay in the 1960 Rome Olympics which ultimately forced him into early retirement. He then went into a number of business ventures after retiring and even once became the customs coordinator for Elizalde and Company, Inc. He started his coaching in 1975, leading the Mapúa Cardinals to the NCAA title and the UST women’s basketball team to the UAAP title. He also handled the UST Glowing Goldies in the UAAP and the Army Jungle Fighters in the Philippine Basketball League. Badion died of a heart attack on June 20, 2002.

They went to malls and local shows to promote the new album and developed a strong underground following. The band signed to the Chicago based Victory Records. They then recorded the early 2003 release Never Be Taken Alive. After the release, they toured with bands such as Taking Back Sunday, The Early November, Fall Out Boy, and Copeland. They also appeared on the Vans Warped Tour. Their touring came to an abrupt stop when they were in a van accident in September 2003.

In the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association, Lim played a key role for multi-titled YCO that won the National Open crown a record seven straight time under coaches Leo Prieto and the late Tito Eduque. Lim, a two-time Olympian, played on two Asian Games gold medal teams in 1954 and 1958. He saw action for the Philippine selection that finished ninth at the 1959 FIBA World Championship in Chile. A hard-nosed guard, Lim led San Beda to back-to-back NCAA titles as a collegian. After hanging up his sneakers, Lim went on to become a successful businessman, chairman of the Makati Stock Exchange, and since 1995, chairman emeritus of the Philippine Stock Exchange.

All The Way, Boys! (aka and Plane Crazy) is a 1973 Italian adventure film directed by Giuseppe Colizzi. The film stars the popular quasi-comedy team of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. The duo, known as “The Trinity Boys,” made 18 films together, most in the Spaghetti Western genre, but ... All The Way, Boys! was the first film set in a modern context, although many other slapstick elements of the earlier films were carried over. Plot Salud (Bud Spencer) and Plata (Terence Hill) eke out a living as bush pilots in South America. Beside carrying a few passengers and a small amount of cargo, their most lucrative activity is in faking aircraft crashes, on behalf of Salud's brother (Alexander Allerson), who will be able to collect the insurance money. Flying over the Andes on another flight, the two pilots crash for real in the middle of the piranha-infested jungle. In a native village, they meet Matto (Cyril Cusack), an old man who takes Salud to see a mountain and tells him the story of three friends who killed themselves. There, the duo find an emerald mining operation run by the unscrupulous Mr. Ears (Reinhard Kolldehoff). Ears dictates prices on the black market, uses thugs to keep out competitors, and keeps his workers as slave labor. Plata and Salud decide they will confront Ears, using aircraft to deliver their goods, and offering the natives a much better life. Wanting to fly Matto to Salvador, where he would live in a modern city, Plata and Salud take the old man and his dog along with them, but he passes away on the flight. Plata finds a large emerald tied to a cord that Matto wore. In Salvador, the two inept crooks try to cash in on their find, but end up in jail. After a successful breakout, the pair find themselves pitted against the ruthless Ears, but in the end, right prevails.

Three series were made by the BBC between 1981 and 1983. The show bolstered the careers of Ullman and Henry, as well as being an outlet for young writers including Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, Ian Hislop and Nick Revell. Ullman and Henry went on to greater success after the show, with Ullman initially launching a brief but successful pop career in 1983 before starring in the ITV sitcom Girls On Top in 1985 and then going on to a high-profile career on American television.

During the later stages of Barnes' legal appeals, human rights groups and anti-death penalty advocates raised questions about Barnes' murder conviction, leading to international media attention and diplomatic protests from the government of France. Barnes was executed on March 1, 2000.  Murder and conviction  The murder occurred on November 29, 1989 in Wichita Falls, Texas. Bass, 42, was surprised by Barnes, who had broken into her home while she was at work, then robbed, beaten, stabbed, and killed by a gunshot to the head. She may have also been raped. Barnes's conviction was based on forensic evidence and witness testimony placing him at the crime scene. His fingerprints were on a bedside lamp that was used to bludgeon Bass, traces of his semen were present at the scene, and two patches of blood on his clothing were confirmed by DNA analysis to have been hers. Prosecution witnesses described seeing Barnes trespassing in Bass's yard about one hour before she returned from work. When arrested, he was in possession of a .32 caliber pistol belonging to Bass. Barnes had a prior record for two robberies. He had been unable to afford his own lawyers and the Wichita County Public Defender's office was not equipped to handle his case, so two local attorneys were appointed for him. Their budget and preparation was minimal, no defense investigation was conducted, and no forensic tests were ordered by the defense. Barnes was convicted by the jury after three hours of deliberation and sentenced to death shortly after. Appeals process During Barnes' appeals process, two new attorneys were appointed to his case by a Federal court. European anti-death penalty activists contributed some $16,000 to his defense fund, and the new lawyers paid for forensic tests out of their own pocket. The new defense team uncovered deficiencies in the forensic evidence, serious errors and oversights by the original defense team, and problems with the credibility of prosecution witnesses. *Barnes claimed at trial that he had never had sexual contact, consensual or forced, with Bass. DNA testing some years after the trial showed that the semen on her corpse was his. Barnes then claimed that he and Bass had an existing sexual relationship before the crime but on the advice of his original defense team he did not tell the jury. *At trial, the jury had heard that a brand new lamp was found with Barnes' fingerprints on it. The new defense investigation found that the lamp had not been new, and that Barnes had visited Bass' house after she had bought it. *The bloodstains found on Barnes' clothing, and confirmed by DNA to have been Bass's blood, were very small. This was inconsistent with the extremely violent nature of the killing and the amount of blood found at the scene. Tests revealed that the bloodstains contained an extremely high level of citric acid, which is used as a preservative in crime labs. *The prosecution witness who identified Barnes trespassing at Bass's residence had given inconsistent testimony on different occasions, he described seeing Barnes some 45 minutes after Bass had already returned home. International attention Barnes was executed on March 1, 2000. For his last meal, he requested \\"Justice, Equality, World Peace\\".

One of ASLEF's aims is, In 1978, ASLEF's governing body, the Annual Assembly of Delegates, passed a resolution to campaign against and \\"expose the obnoxious policies of political parties such as the National Front\\" (NF). In February 2002, Jay Lee, a member of the British National Party (BNP)--which had grown from the NF--joined ASLEF. In April 2002, Lee stood as a candidate for the BNP in the Bexley local elections. On 17 April 2002, an ASLEF officer sent a report on Lee to the union's General Secretary, including information that Lee was a BNP activist, had distributed anti-Islamic leaflets and that in 1998 he had been a BNP candidate in Newham. Attached was an article written by Lee for Spearhead, the BNP magazine, and a fax from the Bexley Council for Racial Equality stating that Lee had seriously harassed Anti-Nazi League pamphleteers. On 19 April 2002, the Executive Committee of ASLEF voted unanimously to expel Lee, on the grounds that his membership of the BNP was incompatible with membership of ASLEF, that he was likely to bring the union into disrepute and that he was against the objects of the union. Judgment =Domestic appeals= Jay Lee took ASLEF to the Employment Tribunal to contest his expulsion, under section 174 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which prohibits unions from excluding or expelling persons wholly or to any extent on the ground that the individual is or was a member of a political party. He was successful in his case. ASLEF appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal which overturned the earlier decision, finding that a union could expel a member on the ground of his or her conduct, and referred the case to a second Employment Tribunal. However, the second tribunal upheld Lee's complaint, saying that his expulsion had been \\"primarily because of his membership of the BNP\\". ASLEF was therefore forced to re-admit Lee as a member, in breach of its own rules. Failure to re-admit would have meant paying compensation of at least €8,600. Even though it re- admitted Lee, ASLEF remained exposed to a claim for compensation of up to €94,200. ASLEF lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR, in Strasbourg) on 24 March 2005. The complaint relied on Article 11 of the European Convention of Human Rights (freedom of assembly and association), which states, ASLEF's case was that the union had been prevented from expelling a member due to his membership of the BNP, a political party which advocates views inimical to its own, and that this was an infringement of freedom of association. The nature of the argument is that the United Kingdom's law (i.e. s.174 of TULRCA 1992) which required ASLEF to take back Lee into union membership or face compensation payments, violates union members' freedom of association. So ASLEF was now suing the UK government (rather than Lee). =European Court of Human Rights= Finding in ASLEF's favour, the Court held unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 11 and awarded the union €53,900 for costs and expenses. The Court held that just as a worker should be free to join or not join a union, so is a trade union equally free to choose its members. Article 11 could not be interpreted as imposing obligations on associations to admit anyone who applied to join. Further, where associations are set up by people who share common values, ideals and goals, it would run counter to the very effectiveness of the freedom at stake if they had no control over their membership. The Court's view was that the United Kingdom had not struck the right balance between Lee's right and the rights of ASLEF. The Court was persuaded that expulsion did not impinge in any significant way on Lee's freedom of expression or political activity, nor would he suffer any detriment: there being no \\"closed shop\\", there was no apparent prejudice to him in terms of employment or livelihood. Of greater weight was the union's right to choose its members. Trade unions in the UK and Europe were commonly affiliated to political parties or movements, particularly those on the left. They were not \\"bodies solely devoted to the politically-neutral aspects of the well-being of their members, but were often ideological with strongly held views\\".European Court of Human Rights: Case of Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers & Firemen (ASLEF) v. The United Kingdom (Application no. 11002/05) There had been no suggestion in the Employment Tribunal hearings that ASLEF had erred in concluding that Lee's political values and ideals fundamentally clashed with its own. The UK government argued that UK law would have allowed Lee's expulsion if ASLEF had restricted itself to a complaint solely about Lee's conduct. However, the Court noted that the Employment Tribunal found that ASLEF's objections were primarily based on his BNP membership, and the Court thought it unreasonable to expect ASLEF to use the pretext of a complaint about conduct, since this was carried out by him in the context of his membership of the BNP. In the absence of any hardship suffered by Lee or any abusive and unreasonable conduct by ASLEF, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 11 and found in favour of ASLEF. Significance Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, described the European court's decision as an \\"important and welcome judgment\\", saying that it was \\"common sense\\" that unions \\"should not be forced to accept into membership people opposed to the basic principles of trade unionism.\\" He added, \\"Every union will welcome this clear decision that they can now expel BNP members.\\" The ASLEF General Secretary, Keith Norman, thanked the 18 unions who gave ASLEF financial assistance to allow them to go to the European courts: NUM, CYWU, PFA, UCATT, NATFHE, NAPO, USDAW, EIS, RMT, UNISON, PCS, NUMAST, Community, CWU, CSP, GMB, FBU and NUJ.

In macroeconomics, a general glut is an excess of supply in relation to demand, specifically, when there is more production in all fields of production in comparison with what resources are available to consume (purchase) said production. This exhibits itself in a general recession or depression, with high and persistent underutilization of resources, notably unemployment and idle factories. The Great Depression is often cited as an archetypal example of a general glut. The term dates to the beginnings of classical economics in the late 18th century, and there is a long-running debate on the existence, causes, and solutions of a general glut. Some classical and neoclassical economists argue that there are no general gluts, advocating a form of Say's law (conventionally but controversially phrased as \\"supply creates its own demand\\"), and that any idling is due to misallocation of resources between sectors, not overall, because overproduction in one sector necessitates underproduction in others, as is demonstrable in severe price falls when such alleged 'malinvestment' in gluts clear; unemployment is seen as voluntary, or a transient phenomenon as the economy adjusts. Others cite the frequent and recurrent economic crises of the economic cycle as examples of a general glut, propose various causes and advocate various solutions, most commonly fiscal stimulus (government deficit spending), a view advocated in the 19th and early 20th century by underconsumptionist economists, and in the mid to late 20th and 21st century by Keynesian economics and related schools of economic thought. One can distinguish between those who see a general glut (greater supply than demand) as a supply-side issue, calling it overproduction (excess production), and those who see it as a demand-side issue, calling it underconsumption (deficient consumption). Some believe that both of these occur, such as Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi, one of the earliest modern theorists of the economic cycle.  Classical economic theory  =Introduction= The general glut problem is identified within the classical political economy of the era of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. The problem is that, as labor becomes specialized, if people want a higher standard of living, they must produce more. However, producing more lowers prices and leads to the need to produce yet more in response. If those who have money choose not to spend it, then it is possible for a national economy to become glutted with all of the goods it produces, and still be producing more in hopes of overcoming the deficit. While Say's Law supposedly dealt with this problem, successive economists came up with new scenarios which could throw an economy out of general equilibrium, or require expansion through conquest, which became termed imperialism. =The nature of the general glut= In Classical Economics, the chief economic concern of all economists according to Thomas Sowell (On Classical Economics, 2006, pp. 22) was how to generate and sustain stable economic growth on a national level. Each factory-producer's basic concern is of maximizing return on investment through sales. Yet, concern was also expressed that savings (and not spending money by the wealthy classes) or production of the wrong items contrary to market demand would produce a nationwide economic glut (a.k.a. recession/depression) because of the un-purchased (unconsumed) products which result in unemployment, idle factories, low national output, and wealth fleeting from the nation. Some theorized that a general glut is then (in the basic case over time) avoidable and not inevitable. Say's Law says, Since \\"savings equals investment\\" in a bank or other wise, money is always spent and ultimately reinvested into more or newer production activities which generates demand (both for the production resources and the items produced). Say's Law: Since \\"demand is always present,\\" then, \\"production generates its own demand.\\" Then if a glut exists, producers must react to market demand liquidating glut items and produce the items the market desires. Demand will return and any remaining glut will then be distributed by the market. A company/country only needs to keep producing, or produce more wisely, or respond to market conditions with products that meet consumer's demands to avoid a (national recession/depression) glut. =Say's law= According to French economist Jean-Baptiste Say, the concentration of wealth into resources dedicated to savings and re-investment simply adds to the ability of consumption to consume more. And so, he states, there can be no general glut because investment in \\"production creates its own demand.\\" A producer/country only need liquidate the glut items and redirect its production activities to items the market demands to eliminate the glut and prosperity will return. =Malthus's solution= Thomas Malthus proposed that a glut of production localised in time rather than by industry or field of production would meet the requirement of Say's Law that general gluts cannot exist and yet would constitute just such a general glut. The consequences then are worked out by Malthus, although Simond de Sismondi first proposed this problem before him. Malthus is more famous for his earlier writings which tried to prove the opposite problem, a general over- consumption, as an inevitability to be lived with rather than solved.  Keynesian  Keynesian economics, and underconsumptionism before it, argue that fiscal stimulus in the form of government deficit spending can solve general gluts. This is a demand side theory, rather than the supply-side theory of classical economics; the fundamental ideas are that savings in a recession or depression causes the paradox of thrift (excess saving, or more pejoratively, \\"hoarding\\"), causing a deficit of effective demand, yielding a general glut. Keynes locates the cause in sticky wages and liquidity preference.  Marxian  Karl Marx's critique of Malthus started from a position of agreement. Marx's idea of capitalist production, however, is characterized by his concentration on the division of labor and his notion that goods are produced for sale and not for consumption or exchange. In other words, goods are produced simply for the intention of transforming output into money. The possibility of a lack of effective demand, therefore, is held only in the possibility that there might be a time lag between the sale of a commodity (the acquisition of money) and the purchase of another (its disbursement). This possibility, also originally crafted by Sismondi (1819), endorsed the idea that the circularity of transactions was not always complete and immediate. If money is held, Marx contended, even if for a little while, there is a breakdown in the exchange process and a general glut can occur. For Marx, since investment is part of aggregate demand, and the stimulus for investment is profitability, accumulation will continue unhindered as far as profitability is high. However, Marx saw that profitability had a tendency to fall, which would lead to a crisis in which insufficient investment generates an insufficiency of demand and a glut of markets. The crisis itself would operate to raise profitability, which would start a new period of accumulation. This would be the mechanism for crisis occurring repeatedly.  Post-Keynesian  Some Post-Keynesian economists see the cause of general gluts in the bursting of credit bubbles, particularly speculative bubbles. In this view, the cause of a general glut is the shift from private sector deficit spending to private sector savings, as in the debt-deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher and the Financial Instability Hypothesis of Hyman Minsky, and locate the paradox of thrift in paying down debt. The shift from spending more than one earns to spending less than one earns (in the aggregate) causes a sustained drop in effective demand, and hence a general glut.  Austrian  Austrian economics do not see \\"general glut\\" as a meaningful way of describing an economy, indeed Austrian Economists do not believe it is possible to have too much of everything. In the Austrian analysis, it is the misallocation of resources that should be avoided. Producing too much of the wrong things, and not enough of the right things, is what Austrians believe to be truly wrong with an economyhttps://mises.org/library/says-law-markets See also * Deflation * Depression (economics) * Overproduction * Underconsumption References External links * \\"Population Malthus\\" P James Category:Recessions ","title":"General glut"},{"id":"9789562","text":"1957 Academy Awards may refer to: * 29th Academy Awards, the Academy Awards ceremony that took place in 1957 * 30th Academy Awards, the 1958 ceremony honoring the best in film for 1957 ","title":"1957 Academy Awards"},{"id":"9789564","text":"Kalabha Kadhalan is a 2006 Indian Tamil-language romantic thriller film directed by debutant Igore, starring Arya, Renuka Menon, and Akshaya in the lead roles. This film was a low-budget production, and the soundtrack was composed by Niru. It enjoyed relatively quiet success and shared a box office hit. It shared a similar storyline to a great thriller S. J. Suryah’s Vaali and another 2006 film called Uyir. The film released on 17 February 2006.  Plot  An IT manager named Akhilan (Arya) and a Tirunelveli girl named Anbarasi (Renuka Menon) are a newly married couple. They shift to their new house in Chennai and begin to live a happy life, even though their marriage was not love-based at first. Soon, Anbarasi's family came to visit them, and they leave Anbarasi's stepsister Kanmani (Akshaya), as she wants to pursue her post-graduate studies in multimedia. As Kanmani stays with Anbarasi and Akhilan in the same house, she begins to develop feelings for Akhilan, even though he is her brother-in-law. Kanmani continues to dream of romancing with Akhilan whenever Anbarasi is not around. Akhilan does not want to hurt his beloved wife, who becomes pregnant and has given birth to their son. Tired of dodging Kanmani for almost a year, he seeks advice from a psychiatrist on how to solve his problem. The psychiatrist tells him to try and marry Kanmani off to anyone else. Akhilan secretly comes to Kanmani's village and requests Kanmani's male cousin to pursue and marry her. Following Akhilan's advice, Kanmani's cousin decides to marry Kanmani, but she rejects him constantly. After about a month, Kanmani's cousin kidnaps her, rapes her, and leaves her at Akhilan's apartment. This shocks everyone in the family, especially Akhilan. He admits secretly to Kanmani about his action and also told that the raping plan was not his advice. The whole family forces Kanmani to marry her cousin, because of the shame of the rape being taboo. The marriage takes place, and Kanmani's family leaves to Thirunelveli. The next morning, Kanmani commits suicide and dies. Akhilan, Anbarasi, and their child go back to Kanmani's village. Anbarasi's aunt hits Kanmani's husband as she thinks that it was because of him Kanmani died. Akhilan, standing right beside him, was all over guilty because it was he who planned all this to avoid Kanmani disturbing his married life.

They were units of the United States Army Medical Corps designed to be man-portable by the team manning the hospital. They were eventually replaced by MASH units. History of the Portable Surgical Hospitals During the summer and fall of 1942, a team of Medical Corps officers modified the basic War Department Table of Organization and Equipment (T/O&E;) for a standard 25-bed station hospital (T/O&E; 8-560, 22 July 1942) into a new theater T/O and table of basic allowances (T/BA) (T/O 8-508-S-SWPA, 31 October 1942) for a portable hospital of 25-beds. The new unit was capable of supporting small units in its camp-type version (with 4 female Army nurses and organic vehicles) or battalion and regimental combat teams in its task force version (without the 4 nurses and organic vehicles). Commanded by a Medical Corps captain or major, the new 29-man portable hospital had 4 medical officers (3 general surgeons and a general surgeon/anesthetist) and 25 enlisted men, including 2 surgical and 11 medical technicians. What really marked a radical departure was that all of the unit's equipment, medical and surgical supplies, and rations could weigh no more than the 29 men could personally transport. Hastily assembled and trained, the portable hospitals suffered from many shortcomings in personnel and equipment, which would soon become obvious in jungle fighting. Probably the single most critical problem was the severe limitation placed on the total weight to assure the unit’s portability. From the start, this meant that to be portable, the unit had to give up medical and surgical equipment and supplies that would have been most useful in the field.

History De La Salle College De La Salle College takes its name from St. John Baptist de La Salle (1651–1719), who founded the Brothers' Order in the time of Louis XIV. Today the Order has establishments in over 80 countries. A few Brothers settled in Jersey at the time of the French Revolution and remained in the Island for several years. Then, from 1866 to 1896, a school of up to 300 pupils run by the Brothers' flourished in St. Thomas's Parish. The Brothers left the Island in 1896, but were invited to return in 1917 to found another school. The school was established at Berry House next to St. Thomas's Church in St. Helier and was initially known as St. Aloysius College. Within a year the main site of the school was moved to a property known as \\"The Beeches\\" on Wellington Hill in the parish of St. Saviour. It was at this point that the name De La Salle College was first given to the school. Under the direction of Brother Edward, the first and longest-serving Headmaster (33 years), the school grew significantly in numbers. On opening day, 1 October 1917, there were just a dozen pupils. By the start of the following year the number had increased to 57 and reached 100 by 1921. In 1933 enrollment topped the 200 mark and a school holiday was given to mark the occasion. The transfer of the school from the French Province in Quimper to the Province of London in 1948 marked a distinct change in the fortunes of the school. By 1949 no fewer than 470 pupils were attending the school. New buildings were planned and erected in the mid-1950s. Many past pupils testify to the tremendous spirit in the school even at times when it lacked buildings and facilities. Without this spirit it is difficult to appreciate how the school could have survived. Two significant factors have helped ensure that the school has a bright future well into the next century. The first was the introduction of the Covenant Scheme. Begun in the mid-1960s, it led initially to the opening of the swimming pool and gymnasium and then to a period of rapid expansion. The 6th Form Block, Science Building, C.D.T. workshops, Art Rooms and the Computer Room were completed in quick succession. Secondly, in 1976, the States of Jersey agreed to provide the school with generous financial assistance in the form of a capitation grant for running costs. The 6th Form Block, Science Labs and I.T. facilities, Art Rooms, C.D.T. workshops and Drawing office, a new Infant School, six new classrooms for secondary and a new Junior School were all completed thanks to the help provided through the Covenant Scheme. A “new age” began in the late 1990s when negotiations began with the States of Jersey for capital funding and the building of 8 new classrooms and a library and resources area began in January 2003. Though there is no longer a Brothers’ Community in Jersey, the school retains close links with the Brothers who are Trustees of the College. Lasallian Voices Lasallian Voices is the termly publication of De La Salle College, Jersey. Students can send in stories, poems and other work to be published in the next edition.

The objective is to provide a mechanism capable of describing product data regarding cutting tools, independent from any particular system. The nature of this description makes it suitable not only for neutral file exchange (free of proprietary format constraints), but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases and archiving, regarding cutting tools. Typically ISO 13399 can be used to exchange data between computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), tool management software, product data management (PDM/EDM), manufacturing resource planning (MRP) or enterprise resource planning (ERP), and other computer-aided technologies (CAx) and systems. The usage of the ISO 13399 standard will simplify the exchange of data for cutting tools. Expected results are lower cost for managing the information about tools and a more accurate and efficient usage of manufacturing resources.

It was released in March 1980 on 99 Records. It was originally released on 12\\" vinyl, as 99 Records' first release. The EP was remastered and re-released in 2004 by Acute Records. The re-release includes the bonus track \\"Bad Smells\\". In 2014, Superior Viaduct re-released Lesson No. 1 in its original 12\\" vinyl format as a double LP with \\"Bad Smells\\". History In the late 1970s, Branca was a member of no wave band Theoretical Girls. While he was out of town touring with the Static, Max's Kansas City invited Theoretical Girls to perform for a 1979 Easter festival.Todd 209. Branca convinced the venue to book him for a solo gig, and he assembled a group that included Barbara Ess and Christine Hahn.Masters 124–125. The group performed \\"Instrumental for Six Guitars\\", and its sound convinced Branca to continue composing for multiple guitars. He began performing solo at rock clubs and avant-garde venues such as The Kitchen. Branca \\"wanted to make sure [his music] was understood as rock and nothing else.\\" Composer Ned Sublette plays guitar on the EP and joined Branca's touring band. Branca knew Ed Bahlman, who sold independent singles at a store run by his girlfriend, and asked Bahlman if he would be interested in starting a label and releasing a record by Branca. Bahlman knew little about recording, pressing, and distributing records, but Branca had some experience with Theoretical Records.Savage and Baker 213. Having seen some of Branca's shows, Bahlman agreed and decided to make Lesson No. 1 the first release by 99 Records. Branca needed guitar players to form a large guitar orchestra, and he posted fliers at record stores in downtown New York City. He held auditions at his apartment where he conducted guitar players. Thurston Moore, who performs on \\"Bad Smells\\", auditioned at the recommendation of his girlfriend Kim Gordon but was rejected. Rhys Chatham of the Gynecologists was initially upset after hearing the new band, feeling that it was reusing his ideas. Branca's group performed around New York and was invited to perform at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.Masters 127. When three musicians pulled out, he recruited guitarist Lee Ranaldo. Ranaldo had seen Branca's ensemble perform at The Kitchen and lived in the same building as Branca's friend, pianist Anthony Coleman. Branca bought tickets providing unlimited flights for three weeks for what became his first tour. The tour began in December 1980 and included Ranaldo, Ned Sublette, David Rosenbloom, Jeffrey Glenn, and Stephan Wischerth. They traveled the country performing \\"Lesson No. 1 for Electric Guitar\\", \\"Dissonance\\", and \\"Compositions\\". Ranaldo, who performed with a six-string guitar strung with E6 strings, emerged as a foil to Branca. The two would playfully butt heads or guitars onstage. Some of the tour's audiences were unfamiliar with art music and heckled the band by calling the work \\"devil's music\\". Composition Lesson No. 1 applies repetitive techniques that Branca learned from Chatham and Jeff Lohn. It combines these minimal music compositions with the aesthetics of punk rock. Branca uses dense overtones and shifting melodies created from repeated electric guitar parts. The guitars build during extended crescendoes. \\"Lesson No. 1 for Electric Guitar\\" was inspired by Joy Division's 1980 single \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" and the work of composer Steve Reich.Masters 126. It opens with two-note guitar figures similar to Reich's experiments with phasing. It introduces one-note parts on the organ and bass that gives the sense of harmonic progression, and drums enter the arrangement three minutes into the track. The piece is a structured improvisation where Branca specified the musical and tonal structures, but the strumming technique was improvised.Duckworth 435. \\"Dissonance\\" is performed by Branca and Michael Gross on guitar, F.L. Schröder on bass, Coleman on organ, Wischerth on drums, and Harry Spitz on sledgehammer. Its polyrhythms imitate the constant motion of urban life. \\"Bad Smells\\" was originally commissioned by Twyla Tharp for a dance piece but was instead included on a 1982 spoken word record by John Giorno. The song features five guitarists: Branca, Sublette, Rosenbloom, Moore, and Ranaldo. Reception and impact Upon Lesson No. 1s original release, John Rockwell wrote for The New York Times that \\"the effects and textures Mr. Branca achieves are really remarkable, and the sound…is unlike anything in music.\\" AllMusic called the EP \\"a powerful, wrenching, transcendent piece of rock guitar classicism\\". Slant Magazine said that the EP is \\"primarily interesting as a historical curiosity that provides deeper insight into the genesis of Branca's music\\". Pitchfork Media commented that \\"the sound remains close enough to grab hold of you and lift you into Branca's intense world.\\" The publication included \\"Lesson No. 1 for Electric Guitar\\" in its collection of The Pitchfork 500. Despite only selling a few thousand copies, Lesson No. 1 became a seminal work in New York City's no wave movement. It became an influence on Moore and Ranaldo's work as members of alternative rock band Sonic Youth, and it paved the way for other experimental rock bands such as Swans. \\"Lesson No. 1 for Electric Guitar\\" is included in Soul Jazz Records' 2003 compilation New York Noise.

Bowden brakes and cables designed for use with this rim were introduced in 1896. Westwood rims have also been found ideal for use with drum brakes. They were last used on the roadster cycles found in Britain up to the 1980s and still common in South and East Asia and Africa and becoming common once again in Europe. Westwood rims have rounded sides, so they are not suitable for use with caliper brakes. Westwood rims features a wide single-wall cross section, the inside circumference of the rim has a contoured section shape to aid with strength. Today Westwood profile rims found in the West are mostly used in drum brake system roadsters and, to a lesser degree, in bicycles with coaster brake systems. Variations and sizes Stainless steel Westrick rim Raleigh Bicycle Company developed a variation that combined the rod braking surfaces of Westwood rims with flat sides for caliper braking.

He played principally as a second baseman and in the minor leagues. He did play three seasons in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Wolverines in 1888, the Toledo Maumees in 1890, and the Washington Senators in 1895. Nicholson's only full season in the major leagues came in 1890 with Toledo when he appeared in 134 games, all at second base, and compiled a .268 batting average with 11 triples, four home runs, 72 RBIs and 46 stolen bases. Over the course of 12 minor league seasons, Nicholson appeared in 837 games and compiled a .303 batting average with 48 triples, 37 home runs, and 354 stolen bases. Early years and nickname Nicholson was born in Blaine, Ohio, in 1863. He received the nickname \\"Parson\\" because he refused to play baseball on Sundays. Professional baseball career =Ohio minor leagues= Nicholson began his professional baseball career playing for minor league clubs in Columbus, Barnesville, and Wooster, Ohio, and in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In 1887, at age 24, he compiled a .357 batting average playing in the Ohio State League for teams in Wheeling, West Virginia, and Steubenville, Ohio. =Detroit and Toledo= 1888 baseball card of Nicholson In 1888, Nicholson played for the St. Louis Whites in the Western Association. He joined the Detroit Wolverines late in the season, making his major league debut on September 14, 1888. He appeared in 24 games as a second baseman for Detroit and compiled a .259 batting average. The 1888 Detroit team finished in fifth place with a 68-63 record. With high salaries owed to the team's star players, and gate receipts declining markedly, the team folded in October 1888 with the players being sold to other teams. Nicholson was acquired by the Cleveland Spiders, but the Spiders sold Nicholson to the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League in May 1889 for $500. Nicholson appeared in 87 games for the Mud Hens in 1889 and moved with the team when they joined the American Association and became the Toledo Maumees in 1890. Nicholson appeared in 134 games, all at second base, for the Maumees in 1890, his lengthiest stint in the majors. He compiled a .268 batting average with 11 triples, four home runs, 72 RBIs and 46 stolen bases. =Return to the minors= In 1891, Nicholson returned to the minor leagues, playing for the Sioux City Huskers in the Western Association. During the 1892 season, Nicholson played for three different teams—Joliet/Aurora in the Illinois-Iowa League, Chattanooga in the Southern Association, and Toledo in the Western League. Nicholson then spent the 1893 and 1894 seasons playing for Erie in the Eastern League. He totaled 141 stolen bases in two seasons with Erie and compiled batting averages of .306 and .333. =Washington= Nicholson (middle row, far right) with the 1895 Washington Senators In 1895, Nicholson returned to the major leagues with the Washington Senators. In 10 games for Washington, he compiled a .184 batting average with a triple, five RBIs and six stolen bases. He appeared in his final major league game on May 6, 1895. =Final years in the minors= After being released by the Senators, Nicholson signed with the Detroit Tigers, then of the Western League. During the 1895 season, he hit .348 in 81 games for the Tigers and had three triples and nine home runs. He had the second highest batting average on the Detroit club in 1895. Nicholson continued to play in the minors through the 1899 season. He split the 1897 season playing with three Western League teams and played the 1898 season for Newark in the Atlantic League and Kansas City in the Western League. He concluded his playing career in 1899 as a player- manager for Wheeling in the Interstate League. =Career totals= Over three major league seasons, Nicholson appeared in 168 games, 158 of them at second base. He compiled a .262 batting average with 15 triples, five home runs, 86 RBIs, and 58 stolen bases. Nicholson also appeared in 837 minor league games, 640 at second base, over a span of 12 seasons. During his minor league career, he batted .303 with 48 triples, 37 home runs, and 354 stolen bases. Later years While still an active ball player, Nicholson became the principal owner of a shoe business in Bellaire, Ohio, known as Nicholson and Ball. He continued to operate the shoe business after his playing career ended. He was also elected as the mayor of Bellaire in 1903 and was the superintendent of the Trinity Lutheran Church for 25 years.

It is in size and consists of woodland, meadows, wetlands, and an assortment of past and present municipal uses. The wooded area has been designated as an Environmentally Significant Area (ESA) by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. An ESA designation is useful in highlighting valuable natural areas but this does not affect planning uses. The area is currently zoned as undeveloped parkland. Crothers Woods was named after George W. Crothers who owned and operated an equipment dealership called Crothers Caterpillar which sold and serviced new and used heavy machinery for the construction and mining industries. The company stayed until 1979 when they relocated to Vaughan, Ontario (now as Toromont CAT). Murhal Developments bought the property and eventually sold it to Loblaws which built the store that currently occupies the site just off Millwood Road.Crothers Caterpillar (Aerial photo), Leaside Historical Collection: Education, Community Affairs, Business/Industry, Volume 1, Leaside Public Library, undated.Planning Report for Proposed Development of 1101 Millwood Road, Malone Given Parsons Ltd, May 1983. While there are no clear boundaries, Crothers Woods is generally thought to include both sides of the valley that extends from Pottery Road and the Bayview Avenue extension in the south and west to the Millwood Road bridge in the east. Further east, good quality forest exists on the north side of the valley for another 1.2 km to the western edge of E.T. Seton Park. The land in this part of the valley is owned by the TRCA and managed by the city of Toronto's Parks and Forestry Department. History Name plate from a Crothers Caterpillar vehicle, excavated from the woods, May 2008 Prior to European colonisation, this area of the valley was heavily wooded. The area remained relatively untouched until 1787 when this area was bought from the Mississauga natives as part of the Toronto Purchase. After the establishment of York in 1793, land grants were made for much of the land north of the city including the Don Valley. In the 1800s, the Don River was exploited for its capacity to support water driven mills. At least two mills were constructed in this part of the valley. They were eventually purchased by the Taylor family who owned the Don Valley Brick Works. Due to urban expansion, the city constructed the North Toronto Sewage Treatment Plant in 1929. This handles effluent from local areas, including Leaside and North Toronto. Domtar operated a plant that produced and recycled paper products. It was acquired in 1961 from Howard Smith Paper Mills and began as Tayor's Upper Mill in 1846 and later as York Paper Mills and Don Valley Paper Mill Company.http://www.lostrivers.ca/points/DonPmill.htm Immediately to the north of it was Bate Chemical and Polyresins Inc., manufacturer of oil- and water-based paint resins and adhesives. (It was also subcontracted from Lever Bros to make Ajax Liquid cleaners.) They operated until the late 1980s when they closed. Subsequently, the TRCA purchased the land and demolished all of the buildings except for Bate Chemical's research and development lab building. It was converted into the Toronto Police dog training facility. The rest of the area was cleaned up and the contaminated soil removed. On the north side of the valley, the land where a former brick making operation called Sun Valley Ltd. was used as an industrial landfill. This was used mostly for brick and ash waste from nearby industry. It was shut down in the 1980s. The dump was capped with clean fill and now is marked by a large meadow covered with invasive grasses and plants. It is currently undergoing natural restoration efforts. In particular it has become the Don Valley site for Trees Across Toronto, a citywide tree planting program. Forest Crothers Woods is known as a beech-maple-oak climax forest. It includes such tree species as American beech, sugar maple, black walnut, and red and white oak. There are also a few butternut which are currently listed as an endangered species by the Species at Risk Act. In, 1995, the forest was designated as an ESA partly due to the quality of the forest but also to the presence of rare understory plants. These include greater straw sedge, thin- leaved sunflower, and pale-leaved sunflower.Miller, Gavin, Crothers Woods: Environmentally Significant Area #133, Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, June 1995. The forest is a good place to view common spring ephemerals such as trout lily, trillium, and bloodroot. Animals typical of an urban forest can be seen here. Black-crowned night herons have been spotted near the river and at ponds within Crothers Woods. red-tailed hawks are also frequent visitors and can be seen hovering over the woods. Recently white- tailed deer have been spotted in the woods and it appears they are becoming permanent residents. Mountain biking Due to the steep walls and the extensive gullies that exist through this part of the valley, Crothers Woods attracted the attention of many user groups over the years. A trail network which was begun by motorcyclists in the 1960s was subsequently adopted by cyclists in the 1980s with the advent of the mountain bike. Cycling usage grew steadily over the next decade, corresponding with the North American popularity of the sport, and the trails were also enjoyed by trail runners, dog-walkers, bird-watchers, and hikers. By the early 1990s, some of the trails had become degraded through overuse. At that time, initial efforts were made by the Parks Department to control the environmental damage by blocking off badly eroded trails. However, this activity was postponed after the Metro amalgamation in 1998. In 2004, the city again became involved at the behest of local groups such as the Task Force to Bring Back the Don. Rather than try to limit use, the city adopted a proactive approach and decided to work with all stakeholders and user groups to repair and improve the trail system. For the short term, they brought in consultants from the International Mountain Bicycling Association and put on trail building workshops. These workshops have taught skills necessary to create shared sustainable trails and have resulted in a marked improvement in the quality of the trail system.Care and Maintenance of Trails in the Don Valley, Bring Back the Don, 2004, . While the cycling community has supported this program with volunteer labour, some environmentalists have been less than sanguine about the continued cycling activity in Crother's Woods. For the longer term, the city commissioned a management plan in 2006 on Crothers Woods to come up with guidelines on how to best manage the trails and alleviate the longstanding friction between the various stakeholders and user groups. As the single largest user group of the trails in Crothers Woods, cyclists have recently organized in order to better deal with the city staff and other smaller stakeholder groups. In 2004, a group called the Don Valley Trails Users Club was formed by cyclists, and was intended to serve as an umbrella organization representing all trail users. In 2007, the DVTUC was superseded by a new organization called the Toronto Off Road Bicycling Group, with a stronger mandate to represent cyclists.

It is located on U.S. Route 33 on the western face of North Fork Mountain. This town was never incorporated as a town, but has existed as an area relevant to local people. The area was inhabited by Native American tribes long before being settled by European immigrants. Those who now live in the area are a mixture of German, Swiss, Irish, Scottish, and English descent. The population is now less than fifty persons. History The town allegedly got its name from the local general store where its owner kept a pet monkey, and from that people began calling the place 'monkey town.'. In reality, Virgil Hinkle, the store owner, never owned a pet monkey. The name actually came from Don Burns saying the children hanging out of neighborhood windows reminded him of a monkey town. The name stuck - still appearing on electric and phone bills as late as the 1980s. At one point in the mid 20th century, the town boasted a bus stop, two country stores (one with gasoline pumps), and a post office located in the first (formerly monkeyed) general store. Today all of these innovations have disappeared, with most of the civic works occurring in nearby Franklin which is the county seat. References * The Pendleton Times, Franklin, WV.

Laid down on 4 April 1932, Bévéziers was launched on 14 October 1935 and commissioned on 4 June 1937. = Second World War = At the beginning of the Second World War Bévéziers was assigned to the 8th Submarine Division, based in Brest, alongside her sisters , and . On the declaration of war on 3 September 1939, Bévéziers was sent to patrol the ports on the northern Spanish coastline, where part of the German commercial fleet had taken refuge, and were suspected of supplying German U-boats. At the beginning of October, the boat was sent with the 8th Division to the Antilles. The submarine then escorted two convoys, and from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool, returning to Brest on 20 April 1940. Following some repairs and refitting, the Bévéziers was sent to Casablanca, and was there when the armistice between France and Germany was concluded on 20 June 1940. The submarine then patrolled the Gulf of Guinea and returned to Dakar on 21 August 1940. Under the command of Capitaine de corvette Lancelot, Bévéziers was in dock at Dakar when, on 23 September, Free French and British forces attacked the city. The repair was quickly abandoned and the submarine was hastily refloated. Bévéziers went on to torpedo the British battleship on 25 September, damaging her and putting her out of action for nearly nine months. On 28 October Bévéziers joined Casabianca, and Sidi- Ferruch to form the 2nd Submarine Division, based in Casablanca. She then sailed to Toulon on 3 January 1941, where she was placed under guard before undergoing a refit. On 12 November the boat was rearmed and sent to Madagascar, where she arrived on 19 February 1942. On 5 May 1942, the submarine was taken by surprise during the preliminary bombardments which began the Battle of Madagascar. She quickly put to sea with two thirds of her crew at 0600. Three Fairey Swordfish fired on the boat, which changed course to evade attack. She came under continued attack, which damaged the boat's hull. One of the three Swordfish managed to dismount Bévézierss machine gun, causing the disappearance of two of the crew and the wounding of four more. The submarine then sank. Recovered and refitted by the Allies the following year and placed in reserve, the submarine was scrapped in 1946. A large part of the boat's hull was nevertheless still visible in 2004 in the Port de la Nièvre at Antsiranana. Notes References  * Further reading *Rohwer, Jürgen and Gerhard Hümmelchen.

He played all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball between 1885 and 1893. Alvord made his major league debut in 1885, his first professional season, appearing in two games for the National League St. Louis Maroons, which had played the previous year in the short-lived Union Association. He was one of several players the Maroons tried in place of their regular third baseman, Ed Caskin, who was in the midst of a poor season in which he batted just .179. However, Alvord was unable to get a hit in his two games, and he returned to the minor leagues for the next several seasons. Alvord's next chance in the majors came in 1889 with the Kansas City Cowboys, a team in the American Association, who acquired him from the minor league Toledo Black Pirates for second baseman Sam Barkley in July. He soon took over as the team's starting third baseman for Jumbo Davis, who was released a few weeks later. The Cowboys folded after the season, and Alvord was picked up by the AA's Toledo Maumees, a new team to the league -- but not a new team to Alvord, as they were actually the Black Pirates under a new name in a more prestigious league. 1890 would prove to be Alvord's best season statistically, setting career highs in most categories, including finishing third in the league in triples with 16. The season would not be as good for the Maumees, who folded after a single season, and Alvord's contract was sold to the NL's Cleveland Spiders. However, after just thirteen games, Alvord was headed back to the AA, as he joined yet another newly-organized team, the Washington Statesmen, who had purchased his contract from Cleveland. He spent the rest of the season as the team's primary third baseman, but his statistics took a nosedive from the previous season. The entire American Association folded after the season, and while the Statesmen made the move to the NL and became the Senators, Alvord would not go with them, as he returned to the minors in 1892. He was given one more chance by the Spiders in 1893, but he lasted just three games in what would wind up as his last season in professional baseball.

Personal life Henry Hicks was born on 26 May 1837 in the city of St Davids, Wales. His parents were Anne () and surgeon Thomas Hicks. Hicks married Mary Richardson in February 1864, with whom he had three daughters. He died on 18 November 1899 in Hendon, London. Medical career Hicks studied medicine at Guy's Hospital in London; in 1862, he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and was licensed by Worshipful Society of Apothecaries. Hicks returned to St Davids to practise medicine, and in 1871, he moved his practise to Hendon, London. Focusing on mental health, Hicks received his Doctor of Medicine from the University of St Andrews in 1878, ultimately becoming the head of an asylum in Hendon Grove, solely treating women for mental disorders. Geology career In St Davids, Hicks met the palæontologist John William Salter, and became enamored with the burgeoning field of study. Hicks discovered a new Lingulella in the red, Cambrian-era rocks near his hometown, and wrote of it to the Geological Society of London. This earned him recognition and a grant from the British Science Association, leading him to find up to thirty more Cambrian species in 1868. Post-1868, Hicks included the higher Paleozoic-era strata in his searches. When he began his psychiatric work in Hendon Grove, this allowed Hicks much more time to devote to the geologic deposits in Middlesex. Hicks coined the terms Pebidian and Dimetian to describe the Precambrian rocks around St Davids; both descriptors were still used by scientists as of the 2010s. Across the Geological Magazine, the Proceedings of the Geologists' Association, the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, and the Reports of the British Association, Hicks published 63 papers. He was also the first to discover fossils (of the Silurian) in the Morte Slates Formation. Hicks was active in the British Science Association, Fellow and president of the Geologists' Association from 1883–1885, and made a Fellow of the Royal Society on 4 June 1885; of the Geological Society, the Welshman was awarded the Bigsby Medal in 1883, secretary from 1890–1893, president from 1896–1898, and vice-president in 1899 at the time of his death. In 1886, Hicks published a paper on 'Bone- Caves' situated in a Carboniferous Limestone escarpment forming the north side of a ravine near Tremeirchion, on the east side of the Vale of Clwyd, Denbighshire, North Wales.

He played eight seasons of Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Blues (1887, 1901), Detroit Wolverines (1888), Toledo Maumees (1890), Pittsburgh Pirates (1894), Washington Senators (1894–95, 1899), and Detroit Tigers (1906). Baseball player Scheibeck was born in Detroit in 1865. He played professional baseball in Detroit in three decades and three leagues, for the Detroit Wolverines of the National League in 1888, for the Detroit Tigers of the Western League from 1895 to 1896, and for the Detroit Tigers of the American League in 1906. When he signed with the Tigers in April 1895, the Detroit Free Press wrote: \\"Scheibeck is not only a daring and good fielder, but he is fast on the lines and can do his share of hitting.\\" A baseball card of Scheibeck Scheibeck began his professional baseball career in 1887 playing shortstop for the Duluth Freezers in the Northwestern League. He compiled a .335 batting average and stole 47 bases in 94 games at Duluth. He played the next two seasons for the London Tecumsehs in the International League. In 1888, he had a .305 batting average and 81 stolen bases in 92 games for London. While Scheibeck appeared in three games for the Cleveland Blues in 1887 and one game for the Detroit Wolverines in 1888, his first extended playing time in Major League Baseball was in 1890 with the Toledo Maumees of the American Association. That year, he led the league with 134 games played at shortstop, 282 putouts at shortstop, and 412 assists at shortstop, but also led the league with 92 errors. He also compiled a .350 on-base percentage, drew 76 bases on balls, and stole 57 bases for Toledo in 1890. After a full season in a major league in 1890, Schebeck spent the next three seasons in the minor leagues, playing for the Sioux City Corn Huskers (1891), Atlanta Firecrackers (1892), Omaha Omahogs (1892), Erie Blackbirds (1893), and Los Angeles Angels (1893). Scheibeck returned to the major leagues in 1894 with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He compiled a .353 batting average and .421 on-base percentage in 116 plate appearances for the Pirates. In 1895, his batting average plummeted to .180 while playing for the Washington Senators.

She acted as Regent of the Marquisate of Montferrat for her son, Boniface from 1518 to his death in 1530. Life Anne was the third child of René, Duke of Alençon and his second wife Margaret of Lorraine, daughter of Frederick, Count of Vaudémont and Yolande of Anjou. Her father died two days after her birth. Portrait of Anne's husband, William IX of Montferrat, by Macrino d'Alba =Marriage= She was betrothed to William IX, Marquis of Montferrat of the Palaiologos family in 1501 and married him on 31 October 1508, the day after her sixteenth birthday, in the church of St. Sauveur in Blois. She bore her husband three children: Maria (1509–1530), Margherita, (1510–1566), and Boniface (1512–1530), William's heir who became Boniface IV of Montferrat. In 1517, her eldest daughter, Maria, was betrothed to Federico II Gonzaga, son of Isabella d'Este, who later became Marquis and Duke of Mantua. The marriage contract was annulled, however, after Federico accused Maria of attempting to poison his mistress Isabella Boschetti, wife of the Count of Calvisano. =Regency= On the death of William in 1518, the infant Boniface inherited the Marquisate. Anne, however, acted as regent until his unexpected death in June 1530. She remained involved in the government of Montferrat when Boniface was succeeded as Marquis by her brother-in-law John George, previously commendatory abbot of Lucedio and (unconsecrated) Bishop of Casale. =Later life= Boniface's death also rekindled Federico II Gonzaga's interest in marrying Maria. On the latter's unexpected death in September 1530 his attentions turned to the second daughter, Margherita. Having weighed up the various proposals for Margherita's hand, Anne opted for the link with the House of Gonzaga and the marriage was concluded in October 1531. In 1533 the Marquis John George died, leaving one natural son, but no heir. A dispute over the succession to the Marquisate, an imperial fiefdom, ensued, the contenders being the Gonzaga, the Marquis of Saluzzo and the House of Savoy, all of whom were able to make plausible claims. Meanwhile, the Montferrat was effectively under Spanish domination. In 1536 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor assigned the fiefdom to Margherita Paleologa and her husband, Federico II, Duke of Mantua. Anne, however, returned as de facto ruler. In 1540 Federico II died at Marmirolo and was succeeded by his seven-year-old son Francesco as Marquis of Montferrat and Duke of Mantua. Margherita Paleologo Gonzaga became regent, together with her brother-in-law Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga. On retiring from public life Anne d'Alençon entered the convent of Dominican Sisters of Catherine of Siena which adjoined her palazzo in Casale Monferrato. She died on 18 October 1562, shortly before her seventieth birthday. The Alençon inheritance In 1525, following the Battle of Pavia, Anne's brother Charles IV, Duke of Alençon died leaving his personal property to Anne and to her sister Françoise d'Alençon{snd}}disputed unsuccessfully by Charles's widow, Marguerite, sister of Francis I, King of France. Anne in turn assigned these assets to Isabella Gonzaga, the eldest daughter of Federico and Margherita. Isabella having renounced the inheritance, Margherita succeeded in having them transferred to her third son Ludovico, later Duke of Nevers and founder of the Gonzaga Nevers branch of the House of Gonzaga.

She was a suspected co-conspirator in the murder of Grigori Rasputin.Radzinsky, Edvard, The Rasputin File, Doubleday, 2000, pp. 476-477 As the first wife of Count Nicholas von Zarnekau, she was known for many years as Countess Marianne von Zarnekau. She became one of the first women of nobility to attend the Imperial School of Dramatic Arts, and she appeared under the stage name of Mariana Fiory in MGM's 1944 film, Song of Russia. Early life Grand Duke Paul and Princess Olga Paley Born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, she was a daughter of Olga Valerianovna Karnovich and her first husband, Maj.-Gen. Erik Augustinovich von Pistohlkors. He was an adjutant to Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, the Tsar's uncle. As a child, Marianne had an older brother, Alexander Erikovich von Pistohlkors, and an older sister, Olga Erikovna von Pistohlkors. When she was still a young girl, her mother began an affair with the widowed Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia, causing a scandal in society. The affair resulted in the birth of a son out of wedlock, Vladimir Paley, who later became a famous poet. Olga Valerianovna von Pistohlkors eventually obtained a divorce and married Grand Duke Paul on 10 October 1902 in a Greek Orthodox Church in Livorno, Italy. Since the couple had deliberately disrespected the authority of Tsar Nicholas II by marrying without his permission, they were banished from Russia and moved to France. In 1904, Grand Duke Paul arranged through Prince Regent Leopold of Bavaria for his wife and her children to be granted titles of nobility. They were styled as Count/Countess von Hohenfelsen and granted a coat of arms. Only after much pleading by relatives did the Tsar finally relent in 1905 and allow them to return to St. Petersburg. Olga was then granted the Russian title of Princess Paley, and her son, Vladimir, became Prince Paley. Unlike morganatic wives of other Romanov Grand Dukes, Olga never bore the title of \\"Princess Romanowsky\\", a name that would have associated her visibly with the Imperial Family. As was customary with morganatic Romanov marriages, moreover, neither Olga nor her children were ever considered to be dynastic members of the Imperial House before the Revolution of 1917.Radzinsky, The Rasputin File, p. 105 Marianne von Pistohlkors thus became, at age 15, a countess, and later the daughter of a princess. Upon the Grand Duke's return from France to St. Petersburg in 1905, Marianne also gained two siblings, children of her stepfather's first marriage, whom she had not previously known: a step-sister, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, and a step-brother, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich of Russia. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna became a Princess of Sweden and wrote a series of well-received memoirs. Grand Duke Dmitri was an excellent horseman who participated in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics and later, along with Marianne, became a suspect in Rasputin's murder.Radzinsky, pp. 476-477, 482 While Marianne attended school, her mother gave birth to two more daughters: Irina Pavlovna Romanovskaya-Paleya (1903–1990) and Natalia Hohenfelsen, Countess von Hohenfelsen (1905–1981).\\"Olga Valieranovna Karnovich\\" Peerage.com Both girls went on to become fashion models in the 1920s, and Natalia Paley later became a Hollywood movie star. Between 1905 and the time of Rasputin's murder in 1916, Princess Olga Paley worked hard to make the court of Grand Duke Paul a popular rival to that of the Tsar. The family entertained many important figures in St. Petersburg society, and the house thus became a center of court intrigue.Radzinsky, The Last Tsar According to Gen. Alexander Spiridovich, chief of the Tsar's Secret Personal Police, it was this rivalry between the competing salons of St. Petersburg that eventually resulted in the monk Gregory Rasputin being introduced to the Imperial Family. Rasputin arrived at St. Petersburg in 1907, won admirers, and was adopted in 1908 by Anna Vyrubova, a close friend of the Tsarina.Spiridovich, Gen. Alexander \\"How Rasputin Met the Imperial Family,\\" Alexander Palace Time Machine Marriages Alexander Pistohlkors and his pregnant wife, Alexandra Taneyeva (both at far left), at a gathering of Rasputin's admirers in 1914 Marianne's older brother, Alexander Erikovich von Pistohlkors, was married to Alexandra Taneyeva, the sister of the Tsarina's lady in waiting, Anna Vyrubova. Alexander and his wife were thus drawn into Rasputin's circle of supporters, and their conversation at family gatherings strongly affected the opinions of Princess Olga and Grand Duke Paul. According to Burke's Peerage, Marianne herself married three times: firstly in 1908 to Lt. Col. Peter Petrovich Durnovo, the son of the Tsar's chief of secret police, P.N. Durnovo, and a classmate of Marianne's older brother Alexander; secondly in 1912 to Christopher von Derfelden, another of Alexander's classmates in the Horse Guard; and thirdly, on 30 October 1917, to Count Nicholas Constantinovich von Zarnekau, a cornette in the Horse Guard and the son of Duke Constantine Petrovich of Oldenburg.Burke's Royal Families of the World, Vol. 1, Burke's Peerage, 1977, p. 244ff Murder of Rasputin During World War I, when things began going badly on the Russian Front, the newspapers accused Rasputin of exercising a dark and malevolent influence over the Tsar and Tsarina. Considering it their duty to defend the empire and the honor of the Imperial dynasty, family members (and left and right wing parties in the Imperial Duma) began to plot against him, her and Rasputin. Marianne von Pistohlkors was allegedly one of two women and several men present in the palace belonging to Felix Yussupov on the night that Rasputin was lured there on 17 December 1916. \\"Malanya's also taking part,\\" Yussupov wrote to his wife Princess Irina of Russia in the weeks before the murder. Pistohlkors' nickname was Malanya.Radzinsky, pp. 441, 476-477 She, like Grand Duke Dimitri, was later arrested by the Tsar's secret police following the murder. However, the Tsar later ordered her release. Sympathies were on Pistohlkors' side, according to her mother's memoirs, Memories of Russia 1916-1919. \\"When we arrived at 8 Theatre Square, where Marianne lived, we were stopped by two soldiers who let us through only after taking down our names. All the highest society was at Marianne's! Some ladies she barely knew arrived in order to express sympathy with her. Officers came up to kiss her hand.\\" None of the male co-conspirators ever publicly denounced Pistohlkors or the other woman suspected of involvement, ballerina and film star Vera Karalli. Neither were these women prosecuted in the subsequent legal trials. According to one author, the Tsar kept their names out of the case because he did not want more public displays of sympathy for the murderers of Rasputin. He also knew that his sickly uncle, Grand Duke Paul, was very upset by Dimitri's involvement in the murder and was taking badly the Tsar's decision to exile Dmitri to the Persian front. The Tsar presumably did not want to add to the grand duke's suffering by also charging his stepdaughter.Radzinsky, pp. 476-477 Exile In March 1918, Marianne's half-brother, the poet Prince Vladimir Paley, was arrested by the Bolsheviks and sent to the Urals. He was executed there on 18 July 1918, and his body was dumped in a mine shaft near Alapayevsk. At about this time, Marianne and her new husband, Count Nicholas von Zarnekau, made an effort to help the remaining family of the Grand Duke Paul to escape. According to the memoirs of Marianne's stepsister, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, \\"Once in the beginning of July [1918], late at night, when we had been long asleep, there was a knock at my door. Waking, I saw upon the threshold of my bedroom Marianne Zarnikau, one of my stepmother's daughters by her first marriage. She explained that we must immediately dress and go to Petrograd. She had come from there in an automobile to fetch us. According to information which had come to her the uprising of the Bolsheviks was set for the next day . . . \\" Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1890–1958), step- sister of Marianne von Pistohlkors It proved a false alarm and the family returned to their homes in St. Petersburg, a decision that was a fatal error. The Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich was arrested in August 1918, sent to the St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress, and despite constant pleas for his release by Princess Paley, he was shot on 29 January 1919 and buried in a mass grave. His remains were not discovered until 2011. The Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and her second husband, Prince Roman Putiatin, chose to stay in St. Petersburg, finally escaping to Romania in 1919. Princess Olga Paley escaped via Finland in 1920, and died in Paris on 2 December 1929, at age 64. Marianne and Nicholas von Zarnekau managed to escape from Russia some time after 1923 with the help of her first husband, Peter Dournovo, who arranged for their passage to Finland. They settled in Belgium, and Marianne is mentioned in Anthony Summer's book The File on the Tsar: \\"Countess de Zarnekau, an ex-patriate living in Brussels, told how in about 1923 a nun arrived at their home in Moscow and announced mysteriously that the Tsar and all the family were alive 'somewhere close to the border'. She asked for, and was given, wooly socks to warm the imperial feet. Those who had been able to deal with the little matter of the Tsar's rescue were now apparently having trouble in getting him the right size in socks.\\" Acting career Natalie Paley, younger sister of Marianne von Pistohlkors, became a Hollywood starlet in the 1930s. In 1930, Marianne divorced Count von Zarnekau, her third husband, and launched her acting career in Europe under the stage name of \\"Mariana Fiory\\". In February 1930, she appeared at the Theatre Mathurins in Paris, starring in the role of a German soldier's grieving fiancee in \\"The Man I Killed,\\" a dramatization of the war novel L'Homme que j'ai tue. Playwright Maurice Rostrand reportedly wrote the play specifically for Marianne. The show was a hit and won glowing reviews.\\"Rostand Builds War Play That Elicits Weeps,\\" Oakland CA Tribune, 2 Feb 1930 p. 3 Marianne went on to Rome, to star opposite Emma Gramatica, a popular Italian film actress of the 1930s.Portsmouth NH Herald and Times, 15 July 1937, p. 11 Mariana Fiory, the former Countess von Zarnekau, arrived in the United States in 1936. She first appeared on the New York stage in February 1937 as the lead in Michel Dulud's play \\"Dans le Noir\\" at the Barbizon-Plaza theatre. Mariana then appeared in \\"The Shining Hour\\" with a stock company in New Hampshire, and apparently decided to settle in the U.S.\\"Russian Stars in Rye Beach Play,\\" Portsmouth NH Herald and Times, 15 July 1937, p. 11 Through a friendship with Wally Castelbarco, the daughter of composer Arturo Toscanini, the ex-Countess was signed to appear on NBC.

The production is Ibsen's Rosmersholm' '.\\" In late 1938, Marianne played \\"Tessie Konstantin\\" in the Broadway production of the satire \\"Waltz in Goose Step\\" at the Hudson Theatre.\\"Waltz in Goose Step (1938)\\" BroadwayWorld.com The Brooklyn NY Daily Eagle spotlighted her with a brief interview on 5 November 1938. \\"The Countess Mariana Zarnekau, daughter of Grand Duke Paul and cousin of the late Russian Czar, scorns titles, knows nothing about dictators, and has no quarrels with Stalinists, but 'adores' the stage and the Brooklyn waterfront.\\" Marianne told the reporter she was \\"very, very ready\\" to discourse at length on the worthlessness of royal connections. \\"What did the revolution do for me? Why it set me free, and gave me the chance to fulfill a lifelong ambition to enter the old Imperial Dramatic School and study for the stage.\\" In October 1939, Hollywood columnist May Mann caught up with Mariana Fiory at a smart Russian perfume bar on Fifth Avenue and heard a similar story. \\"I was too young. I did not know what the revolution was all about. We left our palaces and lived crowded in rooms. We were glad to have our lives. . . . I married Count Zarnekau, and we were terribly poor. All of our properties had been seized and we had nothing. I helped to found the first dramatic school in Communistic Russia. Then I went to Paris and starred many seasons on the stage. . . . This spring I starred in 'Window Panes.' I do not long for the old Russia. America is so much more interesting.\\"Mann, May \\"Sparkling Dark Eyes,\\" Ogden UT Standard Examiner, 27 October 1939, p. 10 During World War II, Marianne moved to California, where she appeared with Robert Taylor and several Russian actors in the MGM movie \\"Song of Russia\\" (1944), the story of an American symphonic conductor, trapped in Russia during World War II, who helps with the resistance. Marianne plays \\"Nina.\\" Produced by Joseph Pasternak and directed by Gregory Ratoff, \\"Song of Russia\\" premiered in February 1944.

Igneous textures are used by geologists in determining the mode of origin igneous rocks and are used in rock classification. There are six main types of textures; phaneritic, aphanitic, porphyritic, glassy, pyroclastic and pegmatitic. Aphanitic (a = not, phaner = visible) rocks, in contrast to phaneritic rocks, typically form from lava which crystallize rapidly on or near Earth's surface. When extrusive rocks make contact with the atmosphere they cool quickly, so the minerals do not have time to form large crystals. The individual crystals in an aphanitic igneous rock are not distinguishable to the naked eye. Examples of aphanitic igneous rock include basalt, andesite and rhyolite. Glassy or vitreous textures occur during some volcanic eruptions when the lava is quenched so rapidly that crystallization cannot occur. The result is a natural amorphous glass with few or no crystals. Examples include obsidian. Pegmatitic texture occurs during magma cooling when some minerals may grow so large that they become massive (the size ranges from a few centimetres to several metres). This is typical of pegmatites. Phaneritic (phaner = visible) textures are typical of intrusive igneous rocks, these rocks crystallized slowly below Earth's surface. As magma cools slowly the minerals have time to grow and form large crystals. The minerals in a phaneritic igneous rock are sufficiently large to see each individual crystal with the naked eye. Examples of phaneritic igneous rocks are gabbro, diorite and granite. Porphyritic textures develop when conditions during cooling of a magma change relatively quickly. The earlier formed minerals will have formed slowly and remain as large crystals, whereas, sudden cooling causes the rapid crystallization of the remainder of the melt into a fine grained (aphanitic) matrix. The result is an aphanitic rock with some larger crystals (phenocrysts) imbedded within its matrix. Porphyritic texture also occurs when magma crystallizes below a volcano but is erupted before completing crystallization thus forcing the remaining lava to crystallize more rapidly with much smaller crystals. Pyroclastic (pyro = igneous, clastic = fragment) textures occur when explosive eruptions blast the lava into the air resulting in fragmental, typically glassy material which fall as volcanic ash, lapilli and volcanic bombs.

J. Walker Building, which houses the Madam Walker Legacy Center, was built in 1927 in the city of Indianapolis, in the U.S. state of Indiana, and as Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991. The four-story, multi-purpose Walker Building was named in honor of Madam C. J. Walker, the African American hair care and beauty products entrepreneur who founded the Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company, and designed by the Indianapolis architectural firm of Rubush & Hunter. The building served as the world headquarters for Walker's company, as well as entertainment, business, and commercial hub along Indiana Avenue for the city's African American community from the 1920s to the 1950s. The historic gathering place and venue for community events and arts and cultural programs were saved from demolition in the 1970s. The restored building, which includes African, Egyptian, and Moorish designs, is one of the few remaining African-Art Deco buildings in the United States. The Walker Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. and History Madam C.J. (Sarah Breedlove) Walker (1867–1919), an African-American hair care and beauty products entrepreneur around the turn of the century, began development of the Walker Building and its theatre prior to her death in 1919; however, her daughter, A'Lelia Walker, in collaboration with Freeman B. Ransom, the Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company's attorney, supervised the completion of the project. The building was named in Madam Walker's honor and opened to the public on December 26, 1927, eight years after her death. The four-story, triangular-shaped building at 617 Indiana Avenue was designed by the Indianapolis architectural firm of Rubush & Hunter and built by W. Jungclaus Company. The Walker Building is located along Indiana Avenue, a center \\"of entertainment, business and pride\\" for the city's African American community from the 1920s to the 1950s. The building served as the world headquarters for the Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company, \\"one of the earliest, and for years the most successful, black business empires in the United States.\\" In 1910, Madam Walker established the headquarters for her hair care and beauty business in Indianapolis, Indiana, where her company at one time employed about 3,000 women workers at its on-site factory. The company's new multi- purpose building opened in 1927. In addition to housing the company's headquarters and manufacturing facilities, the Walker building included a Walker beauty school/salon, a fourth-floor ballroom called the Grand Casino, an auditorium/movie theater, a drugstore, the Coffee Pot restaurant/coffee shop, and various professional offices. The Walker Theater Company, a separate entity from the Walker Manufacturing Company, leased the theater space from the manufacturing company and operated it as a stage/movie theater until the mid-1930s when the theater suffered from financial difficulties and outside managers took over its operation. The building's performance spaces were among the many jazz venues lining Indiana Avenue, but the Walker building is only one still standing. Numerous musicians have performed at the Walker theater, including several Indianapolis natives and jazz musicians such as Wes Montgomery, Freddie Hubbard, and J. J. Johnson, among others. The theater also hosted vaudeville acts and film screenings. During the mid-1950s \\"the building and its surrounding neighborhood began a gradual decline\\" as African-American middle-class families began moving to other areas of the city. The theater briefly closed in the 1960s. =Preservation and restoration= \\"By the late 1970s the Walker Building stood nearly abandoned\\" and faced demolition, with only Walker Manufacturing Company remaining housed in the building. A \\"group of Indianapolis citizens recognized the structure's rich history\\" and began a project to preserve the aging building. Although the exact date is not known, it is believed that the theater remained closed from 1978 or 1979 until its restoration was completed and it reopened in 1988. The Madam Walker Building Urban Life Center, an incorporated not-for-profit organization that formed in 1979, \\"purchased the building from the Walker Manufacturing Company and began planning for its restoration\\" with the intention of reestablishing the facility as a cultural center and encouraging economic enterprise. The site was listed on the Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. In 1982 the organization's articles of incorporation were amended to reflect its new name, the Madam Walker Urban Life Center. The first phase of the restoration, which housed offices and the Grand Casino Ballroom, was completed in 1983. A $2.5 million capital campaign raised funds to restore the Walker Theatre with a present-day seating capacity of 935. The influence of African art forms in A'Lelia Walker's original design concept is apparent throughout the restored theatre. Financial support for the restoration came from Lilly Endowment and others donors. In October 1988, the Walker Theatre reopened in the fully restored Walker Building under the management of the Madam Walker Urban Life Center. The Urban Life Center also collaborated on two office structures along Indiana Avenue: Walker Plaza, built in 1989, and 500 Place, which was completed in 1992. The building was designated as a National Historic Landmark on July 17, 1991. In 1996 the Madam Walker Urban Life Center was renamed the Madam Walker Theatre Center to better reflect the organization's purpose. Indiana University and Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis announced in early 2018 its partnership with the Madam Walker Theatre Center to preserve and restore the historic building. When the planned renovations are completed in 2019, IU and IUPUI will offer new programming at the site to continue the center's \\"mission of education, empowerment, entertainment, and the celebration of cultural diversity,\\" as well as serving the local community and assuring the site's economic viability. A grant of more than $15.3 million from the Lilly Endowment will provide the funding for the building's renovation and its transitional operations. The facility will also be renamed the Madam Walker Legacy Center.Madam will not include an \\"e\\" in the new theater's name to reflect the way it was spelled in historical documents. See Olson, \\"$15.3M Walker Theatre rehab to return shine to community gem.\\" See also: Programming Since the Walker building opened in 1927 it has been used as a meeting place and venue for community events and arts and cultural programs. In 1987, the Madam Walker Theatre Center launched the Youth-in-Arts program, which targeted more than 150 youth who may not have the resources to experience the arts outside of their typical school setting. The theatre's educational program was redesigned in 2007. In more recent years the facility's program offerings have been more limited due to the deterioration of the building, aging equipment, and consistent leadership challenges. =Performing arts= The Madam Walker Theatre Center's annual performing arts season opens in early October and continues until early May. Monthly presentations include: *Jazz on the Avenue, with jazz artists in concert on the Main Stage or in a cabaret setting and the Indiana Avenue Renaissance Festival. These programs present local and national artists and aim to educate the community in jazz as an indigenous American art form. *Steppin' on the Avenue, presenting stepping in African American life, as part of the way in which music, song and dance are interrelated in that culture. The program promotes an art form similar to Salsa. *Laughin' on the Avenue, showcasing local and national artists. *Main Stage Series: these programs are primarily presented in the Madam Walker Theatre and include theatre, music, and dance. In some cases, international artists presented under the category of Cultural Connections, usually showcased through workshops and classes, as well as part of the Main Stage season. Artists presented are in many cases in residence at the theatre for two or more days, which aims to allow them to develop and participate in community residency, education, and humanities programming. Educational programs * Project MAPPED, an acronym for Music, Art, Poetry, Performance, Expression, and Dance, is a 12-week interdisciplinary arts curriculum offered 3 days a week in 2-hour intervals targeting grades 3 through 12 and serving students on all performance levels. The program offers chorus & individual voice lessons, string orchestra & individual string lessons, poetry & spoken-word writing, speech lessons, set production & visual arts, and dance (modern, ballet, jazz, tap, and hip hop). Each session culminates with a semiprofessional performance on stage at the Madame Walker Theatre. The sessions are assigned themes dictated by specific historical events or phenomena within American and African-American culture. Students participate in workshops, lecture-demonstrations, and concerts aimed at introducing them to business practices in the music industry, and the creative processes and aesthetics of various genres. * Crushing the Conventional is a concert/lecture/master class series for students, educators and parents showcasing traditional and nontraditional art forms within the African and African-American Diaspora. Admission to these matinee performances is set at an affordable rate. The series occurs during the school day and includes master classes and lectures for parents. * Beyond the Wings is an Arts Administration introductory training initiative of the Center targeting high school students. The program exposes students to basic arts administrative duties and teaches arts administration, with students collecting community service credits which many are required to obtain on a semester basis. * Arts in Education provides arts experiences to Indianapolis Public School students and students in private, suburban and outlying school districts. The program utilizes artists in residence who are participating in humanities or performing arts programs to provide workshops, master classes, lecture- demonstrations and mini-concerts that educate the student to the process, technique and aesthetics of various art forms. The Arts in Education program also includes the Children's Performing Arts Series, which allows students to attend matinée performances at the Madam Walker Theatre. * Madam Walker Academy for Girls provides intermediate-level refinement skills to an underserved segment of the Indianapolis community. Through an ongoing series of workshops, lectures, and activities, participants graduate from the academy with new presentation skills for a variety of settings. The program is open to girls ages 11-17\\\\. * Humanities: the Madam Walker Theatre Center's programming for the humanities is designed to encourage participation at all ages. * Writer's Symposium Series, an ongoing program of the Center designed to familiarize participants with the written word and its place in American culture. The program presents a series of dialogues based in and around the works of local, regional and national authors. * Walker Film Series, a series of films designed to bring visibility to national and international film and video with an emphasis on African and African-American and other ethnic minority filmmakers. * Tours & Living History: The Heritage Center serves as a display space and repository for information regarding C.J. Walker's life and legacy', as well as the lives of African-Americans who have contributed to American culture. This street-level space offers tours, lectures and small heritage programs presented by local living history theatre Freetown Village. =Other uses= The Center also provides facilities for Freetown Village and Iibada Dance Company. It serves as a rental facility for other arts, social, civic and business organizations to host their programs and activities. The theatre is used for pageants, musicals, concerts, lecturers, auditions and rehearsals, motion picture and video screenings, ceremonial awards presentations and other community events. Description The building's ornamentation is loosely based on African motifs, many of which were blended into a \\"more standard Art Deco geometric ornamentation.\\" Some sources describe the Walker Theatre as one of the few remaining African-Art Deco buildings in the United States. A'Lelia Walker commissioned the local architectural firm of Rubush & Hunter to design the 48,000 square foot Walker Building to honor her mother in 1927. The Wm. P. Jungclaus Company constructed the building on a triangular lot at the intersection of North Street, West Street (Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard), and Indiana Avenue in Indianapolis at a cost of $350,000. The Walker Company financed its construction with first and second mortgages. The triangular-shaped building included a theater and ballroom in addition to the Walker Company manufacturing facilities and offices, a Walker beauty school/salon, a drugstore, a restaurant/coffee shop, and office rental spaces.Latham, p. 34. =Exterior= The four-story, Art Deco-style building is constructed with reinforced concrete, yellow brick-faced walls, an asphalt roof, and a concrete foundation. The triangular-shaped building has two main facades along Indiana Avenue and West Street (Dr. Martin Luther King Blvd.). The south (Indiana Avenue) facade includes storefronts and an entrance to the Walker Theatre. The West Street facade includes a stage entrance and emergency exits. Another ground-floor entrance is located at the point of the triangular-shaped building at Indiana Avenue and West Street. Terracotta architectural details surround the ground-level openings on the two main facades. The building's decorative elements contain African, Moorish, and Egyptian motifs and geometric lines. The south facade's upper levels are divided into twelve major bays, while the upper levels of the east facade contains nine major bays. Pilasters with terracotta caps and decorative insets define each bay. Second and third-floor levels include sash windows, but the fourth-floor sash windows have been replaced with casement windows. A parapet extends across ten bays of the south facade with smaller parapets on the east facade and central point of the building. The rear facade is constructed of concrete structural members and red brick. It is one-half story taller than the other facades to accommodate the theater's stage equipment. The theater marquee and box office also include Moorish decorative influences. A one-bay facade facing southeast, toward downtown Indianapolis, once served as the entrance to a drugstore and restaurant/coffee shop. =Interior= Ornamental details on the Madam Walker Theatre The interior ornamentation includes bold colors and Egyptian and Moorish motifs with Art Deco details on the building's stucco walls and ceilings. The theatre, which is the largest section of the building, has a present-day seating capacity of 935. The theatre includes a large stage with a grand drape, pipe organ lofts, an orchestra pit, elaborate decorations, and plush seating, in addition to a small lobby. A wood and lead glass screen separate the lobby area from the theater. The pipe organ lofts also include screens of turned spindles. The stage is flanked with two Egyptian-inspired sphinxes. In addition, the stage walls and ceiling include a variety of designs such as African masks, warrior shields, spears, animals, and other exotic symbols. The theater's decoration also includes brass embellishments. Additional features of the theatre include professional lighting and sound systems, dressing rooms, lobby, box office services, a bar lounge, catering and technical services, and parking spaces. In addition to a theater, the building has additional event venues such as the Grand Casino Ballroom, the Walker Memorial Board Room, and the A'Lelia Bundles Conference Center. The stage and the fourth-floor ballroom have been redecorated over the years. Legacy The Walker Building was listed on the Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. As the Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991. The historic Walker Building, which remains an anchor site along Indiana Avenue, initially served as the headquarters and factory for the Walker Company and as a center of black female employment. It also functioned as a hub \\"of entertainment, business and pride\\" for the city's African American community from the 1920s to the 1950s. The restored building continues to serve the community as a legacy to Madam C.J. Walker's success in the beauty and cosmetology industry, as well as her interest in promoting the arts. It no longer houses the Walker Manufacturing Company, but the building continues to serve as a cultural center for the African American community. The Walker Building is the only extant architectural building of Indiana Avenue's once vibrant nightlife. Since it opened in 1927, the building has offered performances, educational programs, and a gathering place for public and private gatherings and celebrations. As of 2012, the building was one of the city's only National Historic Landmark- owned and operated by African Americans. As a tribute to Madam C.J. Walker, the building's namesake, the facility's ongoing mission is to promote social justice, provide cultural education, and empower \\"the next generation of entrepreneurs, business owners, and civic leaders\\" and serves as a \\"symbol of African-American pride.\\" In pop culture The historic Walker Theatre is referenced in singer/songwriter Leroy Carr's \\"Naptown Blues\\" and Mari Evans's poem, \\"I Am A Black Woman.\\" References Sources     Also,  * Further reading * External links * * Official website Madam C.

Street about a boy and his dog. It was published by J. B. Lippincott Company in June 1954 and reprinted in paperback by Pocket Books in February 1978. It is based on Street's short story \\"Weep No More, My Lady\\", which was published in the 6 December 1941 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. The novel was made into a film of the same name in 1956. Plot summary Skeeter is a 14-year-old orphan who lives with his uncle Jesse in a one-room shack in the swamps of the Pascagoula River in Mississippi. He has heard the sound of a strange animal in the swamp near their shack, and one summer evening he convinces his uncle to help him go out and find it. When they do, they see it is a small animal with short red and white fur that makes a chuckling yodel sound and cleans itself like a cat. Jesse is unsure what the animal is, but Skeeter is convinced it is a dog. The next day, Jesse's friend Alpheus \\"Cash\\" Evans, owner of the general store in the nearby village of Lystra, comes to help Skeeter and Jesse track down the animal. With Evans is his tracking dog Gabe and two vicious hog dogs named Bark and Bellow whom he keeps leashed. Evans releases Gabe at the spot where Skeeter and Jesse saw the animal, and Gabe eventually picks up its scent and starts tracking it. As they listen to Gabe tracking the animal it becomes clear that it is outrunning Gabe. It bursts into the clearing, and Evans releases Bark and Bellow. When the animal stands its ground and fights back against the hog dogs, Evans calls them off and allows it to escape. He acknowledges that Skeeter was right - the animal is a dog. The following day, Skeeter sets out to tame the dog. He is able to locate it, and it proves to be a friendly female who allows him to leash her and bring her with him to the shack. Jesse convinces Skeeter to let her off her leash, and she remains with them. Skeeter decides to name the dog Lady. Skeeter and Jesse take Lady out with them, and when Lady flushes a covey of quail Skeeter becomes determined to train her as a bird dog. However, Lady's behavior makes it clear that she is someone else's dog, and Skeeter fears that Evans will discover who her real owner is. Skeeter is horrified when Lady chases and kills a water rat, something no true bird dog will stoop to. He ties the half-eaten rat around her neck, and brings her back to the shack. There, he find Evans visiting with an English Setter he has just purchased. Evans had planned to give his new dog to Jesse and Skeeter to train (for which he intended to pay them three dollars a week), but seeing Lady with her rat causes him to change his mind. When Skeeter apologizes afterwards, Jesse shrugs it off and tells him to concentrate on training Lady. Within a few months, Skeeter has trained Lady to cast and point like a proper bird dog. A visiting Evans sees Lady pointing at a clump of sage fifty yards away and refuses to believe she has detected birds from so far away. Jesse wagers the cost of a sawblade Evans had given him on credit that Lady is indeed pointing birds. Skeeter is privately dubious, but Jesse wins his bet when a covey of quail break from the sage. Evans is impressed, and he spreads the word about Skeeter's remarkable dog. In time, Evans hears from a traveling salesman out of Mobile, Alabama that a kennel in Connecticut lost a Basenji near Pascagoula. The description of the lost dog, named Isis of the Blue Nile, matches Lady. A sorrowful Evans tells Jesse, who passes the word on to Skeeter. When Lady responds to the name Isis, Skeeter knows he has the lost Basenji, and decides to return her to her rightful owner. A wire is sent to the kennel, and a man named Walden Grover flies down from Connecticut to take possession of Lady. Skeeter himself must put Lady in the crate in Grover's pickup truck, then watch as Grover drives off with her. Evans then asks Skeeter to finish training his English Setter, and the boy accepts. With the $100 reward Grover gave him, the boy buys his toothless uncle a set of false teeth, and puts a down payment on a 20 gauge shotgun for himself. Major themes Good-Bye, My Lady is a coming of age story. When Skeeter tames Lady, Jesse acknowledges the boy's right to keep her, and defers to Skeeter in all matters concerning Lady. Skeeter's growing maturity is also marked by his uncle's willingness to allow him to drink coffee, which is regarded as an adult beverage. As the novel opens, Skeeter is not permitted to drink coffee. After he tames Lady, his uncle allows him heavily creamed coffee, and after he allows Grover to take Lady away, Jesse tells Evans that Skeeter (whom he now refers to by his given name, Claude) drinks his coffee black. James Street, a native of Mississippi, was politically liberal, and his fiction often involved an attempt to reconcile his heritage with his liberal views on race. Good-Bye, My Lady includes an African-American family, the Watsons, who own a farm across the river from Jesse and Skeeter. The Watsons' eldest son, Gates, is a college graduate. Towards the end of the novel Skeeter learns that Gates Watson knew all along where Lady came from, and also about the reward for her return, but remained silent out of friendship for Skeeter. Inspiration and 1942 sequel English Basenji breeder Veronica Tudor- Williams tells of a letter she received from Street in 1942 saying that he first got the idea of writing about a Basenji after seeing a photograph of Veronica Tudor-Williams with some Basenjis in an American magazine. He also wrote that the reader reaction from his first story was so strong that he wrote a sequel, \\"Please Come Home, My Lady\\", reuniting Skeeter with Lady. \\"Please Come Home, My Lady\\" appeared in the 11 April 1942 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. 1956 film After Street's death, Warner Bros. pictures began production of a film version of the novel, starring Brandon deWilde as Skeeter, Walter Brennan as Uncle Jesse, Phil Harris as Cash Evans, and Sidney Poitier as Gates Watson. The film was produced by John Wayne's Batjac Productions, directed by William A. Wellman, and the screenplay was written by Albert Sidney Fleishman. Veronica Tudor-Williams provided the Basenji, named My Lady of the Congo, who played Lady in the film, and also provided four additional dogs to serve as \\"doubles\\" for My Lady. After filming ended, My Lady was adopted by deWilde, and the other dogs were adopted by various members of the film crew. The film version was released on 12 May 1956. It has also appeared under the titles Goodbye, My Lady and The Boy and the Laughing Dog. Good-Bye, My Lady was released by Warner Home Video on VHS on 13 December 1993. The film was released on DVD in December 2010.

Small was the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the 11th Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Background Small grew up in suburban New Rochelle, New York. He graduated from New Rochelle High School followed by Brown University in 1963 where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Spanish literature. He held executive positions in Citicorp and Citibank before becoming the President and COO of the FNMA, a position he held between 1991 and 2000. He is a director of the Chubb Corporation and serves on the boards of Marriott International, Inc., New York City's Spanish Repertory Theatre, the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Time at the Smithsonian The Smithsonian's Board of Regents appointed Small as the Secretary on January 24, 2000 on the strength of his management experience. They hoped he would be able to improve the institution's management and fund-raising, bringing a business style to what had traditionally been a very academic institution. He expanded the commercial sponsorship of museum exhibitions. Roger Sant, the chairman of the executive committee of the Board of Regents, claimed that Small had helped raise $1.1 billion for the institution and contributed half a million dollars himself. Small's plans were met with considerable resistance. In 2001, Small withdrew his proposal to close the Conservation and Research Center in Front Royal, Virginia (now the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute) after strong opposition from scientists. In 2004, Small pleaded guilty to violating federal bird-protection laws (ESA, CITES, MBTA) by owning Amazonian tribal artifacts that contained feathers of protected bird species. In 2006, the Smithsonian agreed to a deal with Showtime Networks to create Smithsonian Networks, a joint venture to create television programming with the Smithsonian's resources. Controversy over the deal emerged when it was disclosed that the network had the right of first refusal for commercial documentaries that rely heavily on Smithsonian collections or staff. In 2007, Acting Smithsonian Inspector General A. Sprightley Ryan reviewed Small's expenses and reported that $90,000 of expenses between 2000 and 2005 were unauthorized, prompting the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington to call on the Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales to investigate whether the spending violated federal law. The U.S. Senate froze a $17 million appropriations increase for the Smithsonian, citing Small's compensation as excessive. On March 26, Small resigned from his position. A subsequent independent report commissioned by the Smithsonian was highly critical of Small's \\"imperialistic and insular\\" management style, including documented resistance to sharing information with the Regents and the audit committee. It also disputed claims earlier made on Small's behalf (see above) on the extent of his personal fund-raising achievements. The Smithsonian in response acknowledged the need to institute reforms in its governance and oversight arrangements. References External links *Lawrence M.

Life Waechter was born in Danzig as a son of a teacher. His family fled over the Baltic Sea after World War II and settled in Sahms (Schleswig-Holstein). Waechter attended the Lauenburg Scholar School in Ratzeburg, where his graphic talents became apparent. He then studied graphic art in Hamburg. In 1962, he moved to Frankfurt and took a job drawing cartoons in an advertisement magazine Die Zeit. His work attracted the attention of the editors of the soon-to-be satire magazine, Pardon. They gave Waechter a preliminary copy and asked for his suggestions. Waechter's constructive criticism earned him a job with the fledgling magazine. While at Pardon, he co-founded the Neue Frankfurter Schule (New Frankfurt School), a group of eminent comic writers and cartoonists. The name was a play on the Frankfurter Schule of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer. The group included Robert Gernhardt, F. W. Bernstein, Bernd Eilert, Eckhard Henscheid, Peter Knorr, Hans Traxler, and Chlodwig Poth. Their work celebrated subversive nonsense, typified by Pardon's regular \\"Welt in Spiegel\\" (\\"In the Mirror\\") feature. Waechter became a father and, by 1970, began writing children's books. Many of these encouraged the reader to complete puzzles and drawings, write in the book, cut it up, or otherwise participate in the story. The books appealed to both children and adults and showcased his artistic talents: simple yet expressive cartoons, carefully cross-hatched pen and ink, collage, and realistic paintings. He would write some forty books throughout his life. They are typified by Anti-Struwwwelpeter (\\"Anti-Strawpeter,\\" a parody of Heinrich Hoffman's popular German children's book, Struwwelpeter), Die Schoepfung (Waechter's re-telling of Biblical creation), and Der Kronenklauer (\\"The Crown Snatchers,\\" an anti-authoritarian fable). In 1979 he co-founded Titanic, another satirical magazine. His cartoons featured regularly until 1992, when he began focusing on teaching, writing books, and writing and directing plays. Waechter's final work was Vollmond (\\"Full Moon\\"), a fantastic tale of a space journey. He completed it while undergoing treatment for lung cancer. He died on September 16, 2005 at the age of 67, leaving behind a wife and three sons.

In the appendix to the first volume of his main work, The World as Will and Representation, Arthur Schopenhauer attempted to assign the psychological cause of Kant's doctrines of the categories and their schemata. Schopenhauer's analysis holds that Kant misused argument by analogy to connect abstract reasoning to empirical perception; Schopenhauer argues that this comparison is baseless, and that its conclusions are thus invalid. From pure intuitions to pure concepts Schopenhauer claimed that Kant had made an important discovery. This was his realization that time and space are known by the human mind (Gemüt) apart from any worldly experience. In fact, they are merely the ways that the mind organizes sensations. Succession is time. Position, shape, and size are space.Critique of Pure Reason, A22 The pure forms of time and space are the basis of the perceptions that constitute experience of objects in the external world. According to Schopenhauer's psychological hypothesis, Kant \\"… aimed at finding for every empirical function of the faculty of knowledge an analogous a priori function … .\\"The World as Will and Representation, Volume I, Appendix, p. 449 Kant's tacit reasoning was similar to the following: \\"If pure intuition is the foundation of empirical intuition, then pure concepts are the foundation of empirical concepts.\\" From this symmetrical analogy, Kant claimed that the human mind has a pure understanding, just as he had previously claimed that the mind has a pure sensibility. This pure understanding, according to Kant, consists of pure concepts or categories which allow the mind to discursively [verbally] think about the objects that are intuitively perceived as being arranged in time and space.Critique of Pure Reason, A80 Using intuitions to substantiate concepts Kant wrote that \\"To demonstrate the reality of our concepts, intuitions are required.\\"Critique of Judgment, § 59 Since empirical concepts are derived from perceptions, examples of the intuitive perceptions can be used to verify the concept. Kant asserted that pure concepts, or categories of the understanding, can also be verified by inspecting their intuitions or schemata. \\"If the concepts are empirical, the intuitions are called examples: if they are pure concepts of the understanding, the intuitions are called schemata.\\" Schopenhauer described the use of examples in the following way: Pure concepts and the pure intuitional form of time Kant preferred to create arrangements in symmetrical, analogous tables or lists. For Kant, the symmetrical analogues of empirical examples are the a priori schemata. But, in the case of pure concepts and their schemata, how could a reference be made to intuitive perceptions? Schopenhauer declares that concepts a priori \\"… have not sprung from perception, but come to it from within, first to receive a content from it. Therefore they have as yet nothing on which they could look back [for verification].The World as Will and Representation, Volume I, Appendix, p. 450 The only intuition that a priori concepts can be referred to is the pure intuitional form of time, according to Kant. Time, the mind's ability to know succession, is the only content of a pure, a priori concept of the understanding, or category. \\"The schemata,\\" he wrote, \\"therefore are nothing but determinations of time a priori according to rules … .\\".Critique of Pure Reason, A145 Kant's use of symmetrical analogy Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata was done, according to him, to help solve the mystery of Kant's way of philosophizing. He tried to show that \\"… after the happy discovery of the two forms of intuition or perception a priori (space and time), Kant attempts, under the guidance of analogy, to demonstrate for every determination of our empirical knowledge an analogue a priori, and this finally extends in the schemata even to a mere psychological fact. Here the apparent depth of thought and the difficulty of the discussion merely serve to conceal from the reader the fact that its content remains an entirely undemonstrable and merely arbitrary assumption.\\"The World as Will and Representation, Volume I, Appendix, p. 450 f. Empirical concepts are ultimately based on empirical perceptions. Kant, however, tried to claim that, analogously, pure concepts (Categories) also have a basis. This pure basis is supposed to be a kind of pure perception, which he called a schema. But such an empiricist analogy contradicts his previous rationalist assertion that pure concepts (Categories) simply exist in the human mind without having been derived from perceptions. Therefore, they are not based on pure, schematic perceptions. References to Schopenhauer's discussion In his 1909 book Kant's Philosophy as Rectified by Schopenhauer, Michael Kelly drew attention to Schopenhauer's discussion of Kant's Schemata. In his Preface, Dr. Kelly justified his book by saying: \\"…a short exposition of Transcendental Idealism with Schopenhauer's constructive and destructive criticism may be of use to those that cannot make a simultaneous study of Kant and Schopenhauer in the original. To think that the former [Kant] can be understood without the latter [Schopenhauer] is a fatal delusion. If anybody should doubt this, let him try to make out what Kant meant by the ' Schematismus,' and he will soon find it advisable to avail himself of the assistance of a man who is worth ten times more than all the post-Kantian philosophers and professors put together.\\"https://archive.org/details/cu31924029023327 In Chapter XI, Kelly provided a condensation of Schopenhauer's explanation of Kant's false analogy between empirical and pure cognitions: > Having sought to find an a priori cognitive faculty corresponding to every > empirical [a posteriori] one, Kant remarked that, in order to make sure that > we are not leaving the solid ground of perception, we often refer back from > the empirical [a posteriori] abstract idea [concept] to the latter [the > perception]. The temporary representative of the idea [concept] thus called > forth, and which is never fully adequate to it, he calls a 'schema,' in > contradistinction to the complete image. He now maintains that, as such a > schema stands between the empirical [a posteriori] idea [concept] and the > clear sensual perception, so also similar ones stand between the a priori > perceptive faculty of the sensibility and the a priori thinking faculty of > the pure understanding. To each category, accordingly, corresponds a special > schema. But Kant overlooks the fact that, in the case of the empirically [a > posteriori] acquired ideas [concepts], we refer back to the perception from > which they have obtained their content, whereas the a priori ideas > [concepts], which have as yet no content, come to the perception from within > [cognition] in order to receive something from it. They have, therefore, > nothing to which they can refer back, and the analogy [of the a priori > schema] with the empirical [a posteriori] schema falls to the ground.

In late February 2000, the Russian military attempted to surround and destroy a large Chechen separatist force (including many foreign fighters) withdrawing from the Chechen capital Grozny to Shatoy and Vedeno in the southern mountains of Chechnya following the 1999–2000 siege and capture of Grozny and the rebel main force's breakout from the city earlier that month.BBC News (6 March 2000) Chechen rebels besieged On 29 February 2000, just hours after Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev had assured his government that the Chechen War was over,Pskov: ready for battle – RT The Independent (15 March 2000) Nation grieves for lost paratroops of Pskov an isolated Russian force composed mainly of a company of paratroopers of the 76th Airborne Division from the city of Pskov found itself cut off by a retreating Chechen column led by Ibn Al- Khattab, commander of foreign fighters in Chechnya. After heavy close-quarters overnight fighting, the Russian positions on the hill were overrun and most of the soldiers were killed. Uncertainty continues to surround many aspects of the engagement, including the number of combatants, casualties, how much artillery support and close air support was provided, and how long the battle even lasted. Battle The goal of a regimental combat group task force of the Russian Airborne Troops (VDV) tactical group in the area, based on the 104th Guards Airborne Regiment of the 76th Division and including also teams from the GRU Spetsnaz, and the elite Vympel group of the FSB, was to block an exit from a gorge, while other Russian forces attempted to encircle a large Chechen force departing the village of Ulus Kert. The 6th Company, part of the regiment's 2nd Battalion, was part of this blocking force. The company's nominal commander was Major Sergey Molodov; however, it was actually led personally by Lieutenant Colonel Mark Yevtyukhin, commander of the entire battalion. With him were a reconnaissance platoon and an artillery forward observer team led by Captain Viktor Romanov.U.S. Army Combined Arms Center (July 2001) ULUS-KERT: An Airborne Company's Last Stand At dawn of 29 February, in dense fog, the Russians were surprised by a large-scale Chechen breakthrough and were attacked from their rear by a reconnaissance group of about 20 rebel fighters, soon joined by many more who then had them surrounded. After suffering heavy losses (including the death of Major Molodov) from the initial ambush, the rest of the Russians retreated to a hilltop designated Height 776, where they hastily dug defensive positions. They received fire support, including from the regimental artillery battalion's 2S9 Nona self-propelled 120 mm mortars; however, a pair of Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters reportedly turned back after being shot at en route. «Мы шли на помощь шестой роте...» – Army.lv The only Russian reinforcement that made it to Height 776 were 14 men of the 4th Company's third platoon, personally led by the battalion's deputy commander, Major Alexander Dostavalov. Attempts by the 1st and 3rd Companies, as well as the rest of the 4th Company, to rescue their surrounded comrades or to stop the breakthrough were largely unsuccessful. Eventually, badly wounded Captain Romanov allegedly called for fire support on his own position before being overrun in the final Chechen attack. According to the Russians, 84 of their soldiers were killed in combat at Height 776, including all of the officers. Only six rank-and-file soldiers survived the battle, four of them injured.

Troshev said 1,000 rebel fighters were involved. This figure was subsequently raised to 1,500–2,000 by Yastrzhembsky and eventually to 2,500 by Troshev. However, according to a statement by Colonel General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, there were only 2,500 to 3,500 separatist fighters left in all of Chechnya at this time.BBC News (10 March 2000): Russia admits heavy losses According to Yastrzhembsky on 6 March, some 70 rebels had laid down their arms at what he called a \\"pocket\\" at Selmentausen, while \\"up to 1,000 might have succeeded in escaping\\". The very first Russian official statements mentioned the death of 100 Chechen fighters at the price of 31 Russian soldiers. According to the article in Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense, separatist casualties in the Argun Gorge area totaled approximately 400 dead, including 200 bodies allegedly found at Height 776. However, the official federal estimate was later raised to about 500 enemy dead, according to the Russian government website,Russian Embassy to Thailand (undated): CHECHNYA: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS and in 2008 the state-controlled English-language TV station Russia Today spoke even of over 700 fighters killed there. On 10 March, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov announced a general order to begin \\"an all-out partisan war\\" and the separatist forces remaining in the still unoccupied territories scattered to launch a long guerrilla war. The Russians thus lost one of their last chances to defeat a large number of the pro-independence fighters in a concentrated position, although in March the federal forces managed to inflict devastating losses against a different column of some 1,000–1,500 fighters (trapping the group under Ruslan Gelayev in the village of Komsomolskoye on 6 March and then killing hundreds of them in the following siege). While there were no civilians in the immediate proximity of the clashes at the uninhabited Height 776, there were severe civilian casualties during the struggle for the broader Argun Gorge area, in particular from the artillery and air attacks on Ulus-Kert, Yaryshmardy and other villages, where thousands of locals and refugees from Grozny were trapped. Furthermore, there were many credible reports of direct atrocities against the population. For example, on 6 March, a group of civilians was detained by soldiers at the notorious Russian checkpoint on the road between Ulus-Kert and Duba-Yurt; 12 men from the group \\"disappeared\\" and the bodies of three of them were unearthed at the nearby village of Tangi-Chu two months later.Human Rights Watch (March 2001): THE \\"DIRTY WAR\\" IN CHECHNYA: FORCED DISAPPEARANCES, TORTURE, AND SUMMARY EXECUTION; The \\"Disappearance\\" of Nineteen People at the Checkpoint Between Duba-Yurt and Chiri-Yurt (13 January, 18 February and 6 March 2000) In an infamous incident later in March, a local girl, Elza Kungayeva, was abducted from her home in Tangi-Chu, then raped and strangled to death by Russian Ground Forces Colonel Yuri Budanov.

Sunday Fund Unlike the General Hospital, which was funded by concerts of the Birmingham Triennial Music Festivals, the Queen's Hospital had no regular large-scale funding. There was a \\"subscription of artisans\\" in 1847 and fetes in Aston Hall in 1856 and 1857. In 1859 the rector of St Martin in the Bull Ring started the Hospital Sunday Fund with church collections donated to Queen's Hospital and other hospitals. As the out-patient facilities at Queen's were grossly inadequate Sampson Gamgee, one of its surgeons, instigated the construction of a new out-patients wing and suggested engaging the help of the working classes in raising funds. At a meeting in Birmingham Town Hall in January 1869, chaired by George Dawson, Gamgee's suggestion was put forward and accepted. An amount of £3,500 was raised in 1871. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 1871. The original fund was then disbanded in 1872. The wing cost £10,000 and was formally opened on 7 November 1873. Saturday Fund On 6 January 1873 Sampson Gamgee raised the suggestion that 'everyone should work overtime for the hospitals on a particular annual Saturday afternoon, to be called \\"Hospital Saturday\\"'. This new scheme called the Birmingham Hospital Saturday Fund was inaugurated on 15 March 1873 with John Skirrow Wright as Chair and Sampson Gamgee as Honorary Secretary, and was the first British scheme for raising money for all voluntary hospitals in an area. By 1879 the collection had dwindled and it was decided to replace them with a fixed weekly contribution of 1d. On 29 December 1891 the fund was incorporated as a limited non-profit company and was able to hold property, and in 1892 Tyn-y-coed, a stone house on a site near Llandudno in North Wales, opened as a convalescent home after its purchase price was donated by two Birmingham sisters, Henrietta and Sarah Stokes. Further homes were opened around the country. In 1895 the BHSF started an ambulance service with four custom- designed cycle ambulances, based on a stretcher held between two bicycles. These were low cost devices which could be kept at police stations around the city and did not need assigned staff or horses. The period after the 1960s saw a merger of similar funds around the country and later, in 2001, the merger of the Hull-based The Health Scheme (THS) with BHSF. On the first Saturday, 15 March 1873, the amount raised was £4,700 from a population of 355,000, an average of 2 3/4d. per head. This figure had increased to £400,000 by 1938. In addition to donations to the Queen's, General, Children's, Women's, Eye, and Dental hospitals, the fund implemented convalescent homes around Britain and an ambulance service. Today it continues as a national non-profit health insurance service.

All Uncle Ray's brand products are currently produced by Uncle Ray's LLC in Detroit, Michigan. Uncle Ray's LLC (formerly Cabana Foods) specializes in potato chips and other snack foods such as onion rings, pretzels, and cheese curls. Uncle Ray's potato chips are sold in 52 chain stores across the U.S and in Canadian Tire Gas Plus (Gas+) stations across Canada. History Ray Jenkins grew up in Detroit, Michigan in poverty. He dropped out of middle school at Grade 8 and took up a job in an iron foundry. He later joined the US Navy, becoming a cook on the USS Bristol. When he returned home, Jenkins decided to open up his own food business. 'Uncle Ray' Jenkins started his career in 1965 when he sold products out of the back seat of his Dodge Dart. This was a partnership with Robert Qualls. \\"We had $150, and we started with chip dip. We had a local dairy make the chip dip, and I sold it to taverns, to bowling allies, to little stores, out of the back seat of my car\\", recalls Jenkins. In 1967, Ray bought 'Cabana,' a pork skins manufacturer, for $1,200 and began selling extruded corn and cheese products. Still operating under the name 'Cabana', Ray purchased a facility in Dearborn, Michigan in 1969. In 1983, he continued his expansion and bought the old Superior Potato Chip factory on the west side of Detroit. Jenkins and Qualls became involved in a contentious legal battle which ended in the early 1990s, when the two men ended their partnership with Jenkins continuing on as the sole owner of the company. In 1993, pondering retirement, Jenkins sold the business to AmeriFoods. The company held Cabana Foods for only two years before selling it back to Jenkins, who changed the company name to Jenkins Foods and launched the 'Uncle Ray's' brand. In April 2006, Ray sold the business to a large privately held company. The new company was established under the 'Uncle Ray's, LLC' name. Jenkins is a Christian. According to him, his belief in God was reinforced after he survived a two-week hospitalization following a hematemesis episode. A brief chapter from Jenkins' autobiography entitled \\"The Life and Times of Uncle Ray\\" can be found on the back of Uncle Ray's brand products. Each offers a moral lesson and includes a bible verse. Uncle Ray's LLC is owned by The H. T. Hackney Company.

It was first broadcast on 15 October 1992.  Synopsis  Richie and Eddie catch a burglar in their living room. Plot The episode begins with Eddie staggering drunkenly into the flat at 1:30am. He went out four and a half hours earlier with £1.75 to buy two fish suppers for himself and Richie, but instead of going to the fish and chip shop, he went to the chemist and spent the money on cheap Old Spice (which was being sold at 25p a bottle), which he drank. While trying to find alcohol around the flat, Eddie drinks a bottle of bleach, and passes out. Richie cannot revive him, and so attaches a noose to his leg and hoists him upstairs to bed. Richie goes to his bedroom to masturbate. A few seconds later, we hear a window smashing. Richie comes out of his bedroom and we hear more objects breaking downstairs. Richie wakes Eddie up. They spend a few minutes deciding what to do. Richie says that the burglars might be looking for drugs, so Eddie suggests throwing Lemsip down the stairs for them. Eddie goes back into his bedroom and brings a service revolver back out with him, and goes to shoot the lock off the hatch into the attic, until Richie asks why they do not use the key and tell him the burglars will hear Eddie shooting his gun. There is no ladder, as it was confiscated by the police when some nurses moved in next door, so Richie has to climb on Eddie's back to reach. Richie falls off Eddie's back, and down the stairs, landing on the burglar (played by Paul Bradley, best known as Nigel Bates in EastEnders). Richie and Eddie tie the burglar to a chair using Sellotape, and try to interrogate him, although they do not really know how to go about doing this. Richie calls the police, but puts the phone down halfway through when Eddie finds the burglar's bag, which is full of silverware. Richie tries ending the phone call by claiming that he has been sleep- telephoning again. They plan to sell the silver and make a new life in the Bahamas, and are walking out of the flat when they realise that something must be done with the burglar. Eddie suggests killing him by feeding him stale fish fingers. They do not have any fish fingers, so Richie sends Eddie onto the roof to get some poisoned pigeon pellets. While outside, we see that a second burglar is on the outer wall of the flat. Eddie falls through the glass roof but gets some pellets, which Richie puts into one of the cups of tea he is making. They take the tea to the burglar but cannot remember which cup contains the poison, especially as all the cups are the same colour, so, after Richie punishes Eddie by shoving a pencil up his nose, they force the burglar to drink all of them. The burglar promptly vomits. The police knock on the door. Richie answers the door to the police while Eddie tries to hide the burglar. Richie claims that he telephoned the police in his sleep, and tries to close the door, but the police officers force their way past Richie into the flat. The police are suspicious about the state of the flat, but Richie says that he caused the mess by \\"sleep-vomiting\\". One of the officers approaches Eddie and asks \\"Do you realise that you have a pencil up your nose?\\" then Eddie says that he has been \\"sleep-doodling\\" again. The officer points out that his paper is upside down and Eddie then says \\"So are my eyes\\". The officers find the shattered glass and Richie says he has been \\"sleep- glazing\\" again. Richie then throws insults to the officers and says that he has just been \\"sleep-slanging\\" again. The officers leave, after hitting Richie on the head with a truncheon for wasting police time. Eddie reveals that he had hidden the burglar by Sellotaping him to the ceiling. While they are attempting to get the burglar down by hitting him with a broom, a second burglar comes in through the window, and knocks Richie and Eddie unconscious with a club. When Richie and Eddie wake up, they are stripped to their underwear. The room has been stripped bare except for two chairs that the pair are tied to. They have mouse traps positioned in front of their genitalia, and Eddie has a note attached to his knee. The episode ends when Eddie reads the note, which says \\"Sue Carpenter\\". This drops their guard, causing the mousetraps to trigger. Consistency errors *In \\"'s Up\\", Eddie says that he does not like fish fingers. However, in this episode Eddie is suggesting to Richie that they use stale fish fingers to poison the burglar only for Richie to remind Eddie that they (both of them) finished them off the previous Thursday.

The First Iconoclasm, as it is sometimes called, existed between about 726 and 787. The Second Iconoclasm was between 814 and 842. According to the traditional view, Byzantine Iconoclasm was started by a ban on religious images by Emperor Leo III and continued under his successors. It was accompanied by widespread destruction of images and persecution of supporters of the veneration of images. The pope remained firmly in support of the use of images throughout the period, and the whole episode widened the growing divergence between the Byzantine and Carolingian traditions in what was still a unified church, as well as facilitating the reduction or removal of Byzantine political control over parts of Italy. Iconoclasm is the deliberate destruction within a culture of the culture's own religious icons and other symbols or monuments, usually for religious or political motives. People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called iconoclasts, Greek for \\"breakers of icons\\" (), a term that has come to be applied figuratively to any person who breaks or disdains established dogmata or conventions. Conversely, people who revere or venerate religious images are derisively called \\"iconolaters\\" (). They are normally known as \\"iconodules\\" (), or \\"iconophiles\\" (). These terms were, however, not a part of the Byzantine debate over images. They have been brought into common usage by modern historians (from the seventeenth century) and their application to Byzantium increased considerably in the late twentieth century. The Byzantine term for the debate over religious imagery, \\"iconomachy,\\" means \\"struggle over images\\" or \\"image struggle\\". Iconoclasm has generally been motivated theologically by an Old Covenant interpretation of the Ten Commandments, which forbade the making and worshipping of \\"graven images\\" (Exodus 20:4, Deuteronomy 5:8, see also Biblical law in Christianity). The two periods of iconoclasm in the Byzantine Empire during the 8th and 9th centuries made use of this theological theme in discussions over the propriety of images of holy figures, including Christ, the Virgin (or Theotokos) and saints. It was a debate triggered by changes in Orthodox worship, which were themselves generated by the major social and political upheavals of the seventh century for the Byzantine Empire. Traditional explanations for Byzantine iconoclasm have sometimes focused on the importance of Islamic prohibitions against images influencing Byzantine thought. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, for example, it was the prestige of Islamic military successes in the 7th and 8th centuries that motivated Byzantine Christians to adopt the Islamic position of rejecting and destroying devotional and liturgical images. The role of women and monks in supporting the veneration of images has also been asserted. Social and class-based arguments have been put forward, such as that iconoclasm created political and economic divisions in Byzantine society; that it was generally supported by the Eastern, poorer, non-Greek peoples of the Empire who had to constantly deal with Arab raids. On the other hand, the wealthier Greeks of Constantinople and also the peoples of the Balkan and Italian provinces strongly opposed Iconoclasm. Re-evaluation of the written and material evidence relating to the period of Byzantine Iconoclasm by scholars including John Haldon and Leslie Brubaker has challenged many of the basic assumptions and factual assertions of the traditional account. Background Byzantine Iconoclasm, Chludov Psalter, 9th century.Byzantine iconoclasm Christian worship by the sixth century had developed a clear belief in the intercession of saints. This belief was also influenced by a concept of hierarchy of sanctity, with the Trinity at its pinnacle, followed by the Virgin Mary, referred to in Greek as the Theotokos (\\"birth-giver of God\\") or Meter Theou (\\"Mother of God\\"), the saints, living holy men, women, and spiritual elders, followed by the rest of humanity. Thus, in order to obtain blessings or divine favour, early Christians, like Christians today, would often pray or ask an intermediary, such as the saints or the Theotokos, or living fellow Christians believed to be holy, to intercede on their behalf with Christ. A strong sacramentality and belief in the importance of physical presence also joined the belief in intercession of saints with the use of relics and holy images (or icons) in early Christian practices. Believers would, therefore, make pilgrimages to places sanctified by the physical presence of Christ or prominent saints and martyrs, such as the site of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Relics, or holy objects (rather than places), which were a part of the claimed remains of, or had supposedly come into contact with, Christ, the Virgin or a saint, were also widely utilized in Christian practices at this time. Relics, a firmly embedded part of veneration by this period, provided physical presence of the divine but were not infinitely reproducible (an original relic was required), and still usually required believers to undertake pilgrimage or have contact with somebody who had. The use and abuse of images had greatly increased during this period, and had generated a growing opposition among many in the church, although the progress and extent of these views is now unclear. Images in the form of mosaics and paintings were widely used in churches, homes and other places such as over city gates, and had since the reign of Justinian I been increasingly taking on a spiritual significance of their own, and regarded at least in the popular mind as capable of possessing capacities in their own right, so that \\"the image acts or behaves as the subject itself is expected to act or behave. It makes known its wishes ... It enacts evangelical teachings, ... When attacked it bleeds, ... [and] In some cases it defends itself against infidels with physical force ...\\". Key artefacts to blur this boundary emerged in c. 570 in the form of miraculously created acheiropoieta or \\"images not made by human hands\\". These sacred images were a form of contact relic, which additionally were taken to prove divine approval of the use of icons. The two most famous were the Mandylion of Edessa (where it still remained) and the Image of Camuliana from Cappadocia, by then in Constantinople. The latter was already regarded as a palladium that had won battles and saved Constantinople from the Persian-Avar siege of 626, when the Patriarch paraded it around the walls of the city. Both were images of Christ, and at least in some versions of their stories supposedly made when Christ pressed a cloth to his face (compare with the later, western Veil of Veronica and Turin shroud). In other versions of the Mandylion's story it joined a number of other images that were believed to have been painted from the life in the New Testament period by Saint Luke or other human painters, again demonstrating the support of Christ and the Virgin for icons, and the continuity of their use in Christianity since its start. G. E. von Grunebaum has said \\"The iconoclasm of the eighth and ninth centuries must be viewed as the climax of a movement that had its roots in the spirituality of the Christian concept of the divinity.\\" The events of the seventh century, which was a period of major crisis for the Byzantine Empire, formed a catalyst for the expansion of the use of images of the holy and caused a dramatic shift in responses to them. Whether the acheiropoieta were a symptom or cause, the late sixth to eighth centuries witnessed the increasing thinning of the boundary between images not made by human hands, and images made by human hands. Images of Christ, the Theotokos and saints increasingly came to be regarded, as relics, contact relics and acheiropoieta already were, as points of access to the divine. By praying before an image of a holy figure, the believer's prayers were magnified by proximity to the holy. This change in practice seems to have been a major and organic development in Christian worship, which responded to the needs of believers to have access to divine support during the insecurities of the seventh century. It was not a change orchestrated or controlled by the Church. Although the Quinisext council did not explicitly state that images should be prayed to, it was a legitimate source of Church authority that stated images of Christ were acceptable as a consequence of his human incarnation. Because Jesus manifested himself as human it was acceptable to make images of him just like it was acceptable to make images of the saints and other humans. The events which have traditionally been labelled 'Byzantine Iconoclasm' may be seen as the efforts of the organised Church and the imperial authorities to respond to these changes and to try to reassert some institutional control over popular practice. The rise of Islam in the seventh century had also caused some consideration of the use of holy images. Early Islamic belief stressed the impropriety of iconic representation. Earlier scholarship tried to link Byzantine Iconoclasm directly to Islam by arguing that Byzantine emperors saw the success of the early Caliphate and decided that Byzantine use of images (as opposed to Islamic aniconism) had angered God. This does not seem entirely plausible however. The use of images had probably been increasing in the years leading up to the outbreak of iconoclasm. One notable change came in 695, when Justinian II put a full-faced image of Christ on the obverse of his gold coins. The effect on iconoclast opinion is unknown, but the change certainly caused Caliph Abd al-Malik to break permanently with his previous adoption of Byzantine coin types to start a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only. This appears more like two opposed camps asserting their positions (pro and anti images) than one empire seeking to imitate the other. More striking is the fact that Islamic iconoclasm rejected any depictions of living people or animals, not only religious images. By contrast, Byzantine iconomachy concerned itself only with the question of the holy presence (or lack thereof) of images. Thus, although the rise of Islam may have created an environment in which images were at the forefront of intellectual question and debate, Islamic iconoclasm does not seem to have had a direct causal role in the development of the Byzantine image debate, in fact Muslim territories became havens for iconophile refugees. However, it has been argued that Leo III, because of his Syrian background, could have been influenced by Islamic beliefs and practises, which could have inspired his first removal of images. The goal of the iconoclasts was to restore the church to the strict opposition to images in worship that they believed characterized at the least some parts of the early church. Theologically, one aspect of the debate, as with most in Christian theology at the time, revolved around the two natures of Jesus. Iconoclasts believed that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of the Messiah at the same time, but only separately. Because an icon which depicted Jesus as purely physical would be Nestorianism, and one which showed Him as both human and divine would not be able to do so without confusing the two natures into one mixed nature, which was Monophysitism, all icons were thus heretical. Leo III did preach a series of sermons in which he drew attention to the excessive behaviour of the iconodules, which Leo III stated was in direct opposition to Mosaic Law as shown in the Second Commandment. However, no detailed writings setting out iconoclast arguments have survived; we have only brief quotations and references in the writings of the iconodules and the nature of Biblical law in Christianity has always been in dispute.  Sources  A thorough understanding of the Iconoclast period in Byzantium is complicated by the fact that most of the surviving sources were written by the ultimate victors in the controversy, the iconodules. It is thus difficult to obtain a complete, objective, balanced, and reliably accurate account of events and various aspects of the controversy. The period was marked by intensely polarized debate amongst at least the clergy, and both sides came to regard the position of the other as heresy, and accordingly made efforts to destroy the writings of the other side when they had the chance. Leo III is said to have ordered the destruction of iconodule texts at the start of the controversy, and the records of the final Second Council of Nicaea record that books with missing pages were reported and produced to the council. Many texts, including works of hagiography and historical writing as well as sermons and theological writings, were undoubtedly \\"improved\\", fabricated or backdated by partisans, and the difficult and highly technical scholarly process of attempting to assess the real authors and dates of many surviving texts remains ongoing. Most iconoclastic texts are simply missing, including a proper record of the council of 754, and the detail of iconoclastic arguments have mostly to be reconstructed with difficulty from their vehement rebuttals by iconodules. Major historical sources for the period include the chronicles of Theophanes the ConfessorC. Mango and R. Scott, trs., The Chronicle of Theophanes Confessor (Oxford, 1997). and the Patriarch Nikephoros,C. Mango, ed. and tr., The short history of Nikephoros (Washington, 1990). both of whom were ardent iconodules. Many historians have also drawn on hagiography, most notably the Life of St. Stephen the Younger,M.-F. Auzépy, tr., La vie d'Étienne le jeune par Étienne le Diacre (Aldershot, 1997). which includes a detailed, but highly biased, account of persecutions during the reign of Constantine V. No account of the period in question written by an iconoclast has been preserved, although certain saints' lives do seem to preserve elements of the iconoclast worldview.I. Ševčenko, \\"Hagiography in the iconoclast period,\\" in A. Bryer and J. Herrin, eds., Iconoclasm (Birmingham, 1977), 113–31. Major theological sources include the writings of John of Damascus,A. Louth, tr., Three treatises on the divine images (Crestwood, 2003). Theodore the Studite,C.P. Roth, tr., On the holy icons (Crestwood, 1981). and the Patriarch Nikephoros, all of them iconodules. The theological arguments of the iconoclasts survive only in the form of selective quotations embedded in iconodule documents, most notably the Acts of the Second Council of Nicaea and the Antirrhetics of Nikephoros.M.-J. Mondzain, tr., Discours contre les iconoclastes (Paris, 1989), Exodus 20:1-17.  The first iconoclast period: 730–787  Argument about icons before the emperor, in the Skylitzis Chronicle An immediate precursor of the controversy seems to have been a large submarine volcanic eruption in the summer of 726 in the Aegean Sea between the island of Thera (modern Santorini) and Therasia, probably causing tsunamis and great loss of life. Many, probably including Leo III, interpreted this as a judgement on the Empire by God, and decided that use of images had been the offence. The classic account of the beginning of Byzantine Iconoclasm relates that sometime between 726 and 730 the Byzantine Emperor Leo III the Isaurian ordered the removal of an image of Christ, prominently placed over the Chalke Gate, the ceremonial entrance to the Great Palace of Constantinople, and its replacement with a cross. Fearing that they intended sacrilege, some of those who were assigned to the task were murdered by a band of iconodules. Accounts of this event (written significantly later) suggest that at least part of the reason for the removal may have been military reversals against the Muslims and the eruption of the volcanic island of Thera,Volcanism on Santorini / eruptive history at decadevolcano.net which Leo possibly viewed as evidence of the Wrath of God brought on by image veneration in the Church.According to accounts by Patriarch Nikephoros and the chronicler Theophanes Leo is said to have described mere image veneration as \\"a craft of idolatry.\\" He apparently forbade the veneration of religious images in a 730 edict, which did not apply to other forms of art, including the image of the emperor, or religious symbols such as the cross. \\"He saw no need to consult the Church, and he appears to have been surprised by the depth of the popular opposition he encountered\\".Warren Treadgold, A History of the Byzantine State and Society, Stanford University Press, 1997 Germanos I of Constantinople, the iconophile Patriarch of Constantinople, either resigned or was deposed following the ban. Surviving letters Germanos wrote at the time say little of theology. According to Patricia Karlin-Hayter, what worried Germanos was that the ban of icons would prove that the Church had been in error for a long time and therefore play into the hands of Jews and Muslims.The Oxford History of Byzantium: Iconoclasm, Patricia Karlin-Hayter, Oxford University Press, 2002. Patriarch Germanos I of Constantinople with icons supported by angels This interpretation is now in doubt, and the debate and struggle may have initially begun in the provinces rather than in the imperial court. Letters survive written by the Patriarch Germanos in the 720s and 730s concerning Constantine, the bishop of Nakoleia, and Thomas of Klaudioupolis. In both sets of letters (the earlier ones concerning Constantine, the later ones Thomas), Germanos reiterates a pro-image position while lamenting the behaviour of his subordinates in the church, who apparently had both expressed reservations about image worship. Germanos complains \\"now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter\\". In both cases, efforts to persuade these men of the propriety of image veneration had failed and some steps had been taken to remove images from their churches. Significantly, in these letters Germanos does not threaten his subordinates if they fail to change their behaviour. He does not seem to refer to a factional split in the church, but rather to an ongoing issue of concern, and Germanos refers to the Emperor Leo III, often presented as the original Iconoclast, as a friend of images. Germanos' concerns are mainly that the actions of Constantine and Thomas should not confuse the laity. At this stage in the debate there is no clear evidence for an imperial involvement in the debate, except that Germanos says he believes that Leo III supports images, leaving a question as to why Leo III has been presented as the arch-iconoclast of Byzantine history. Almost all of the evidence for the reign of Leo III is derived from textual sources, the majority of which post-date his reign considerably, most notably the Life by Stephen the Younger and the Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor. These important sources are fiercely iconophile and are hostile to the Emperor Constantine V (741–775). As Constantine's father, Leo also became a target. Leo's actual views on icon veneration remain obscure, but in any case may not have influenced the initial phase of the debate. During this initial period, concern on both sides seems to have had little to do with theology and more with practical evidence and effects. There was initially no church council, and no prominent patriarchs or bishops called for the removal or destruction of icons. In the process of destroying or obscuring images, Leo is said to have \\"confiscated valuable church plate, altar cloths, and reliquaries decorated with religious figures\\", but he took no severe action against the former patriarch or iconophile bishops. In the West, Pope Gregory III held two synods at Rome and condemned Leo's actions, and in response Leo confiscated papal estates in Calabria and Sicily, detaching them as well as Illyricum from Papal governance and placing them under the governance of the Patriarch of Constantinople.David Knowles – Dimitri Oblensky, \\"The Christian Centuries: Volume 2, The Middle Ages\\", Darton, Longman & Todd, 1969, p. 108-109. = Ecumenical councils = 14th-century miniature of the destruction of a church under the orders of the iconoclast emperor Constantine V Copronymus Leo died in 741, and his son and heir, Constantine V (741–775), was personally committed to an anti-image position. Despite his successes as an emperor, both militarily and culturally, this has caused Constantine to be remembered unfavourably by a body of source material which is preoccupied by his opposition to image veneration. For example, Constantine is accused of being obsessive in his hostility to images and monks; because of this he burned monasteries and images and turned churches into stables, according to the surviving iconophile sources. In 754 Constantine summoned the Council of Hieria in which some 330 to 340 bishops participated and which was the first church council to concern itself primarily with religious imagery. Constantine seems to have been closely involved with the council, and it endorsed an iconoclast position, with 338 assembled bishops declaring, \\"the unlawful art of painting living creatures blasphemed the fundamental doctrine of our salvation--namely, the Incarnation of Christ, and contradicted the six holy synods. ... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, etc. ... let him be anathema.\\" This Council claimed to be the legitimate \\"Seventh Ecumenical Council\\", but its legitimacy is disregarded by both Orthodox and Catholic traditions as no patriarchs or representatives of the five patriarchs were present: Constantinople was vacant while Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria were controlled by Muslims, and Rome did not send a representative. An icon of the Seventh Ecumenical Council (17th century, Novodevichy Convent, Moscow) The iconoclast Council of Hieria was not the end of the matter, however. In this period complex theological arguments appeared, both for and against the use of icons. Constantine himself wrote opposing the veneration of images, while John of Damascus, a Syrian monk living outside of Byzantine territory, became a major opponent of iconoclasm through his theological writings. It has been suggested that monasteries became secret bastions of icon-support, but this view is controversial. A possible reason for this interpretation is the desire in some historiography on Byzantine Iconoclasm to see it as a preface to the later Protestant Reformation in western Europe, in which monastic establishments suffered damage and persecution. In opposition to this view, others have suggested that while some monks continued to support image veneration, many others followed church and imperial policy. The surviving sources accuse Constantine V of moving against monasteries, having relics thrown into the sea, and stopping the invocation of saints. Monks were forced to parade in the Hippodrome, each hand-in-hand with a woman, in violation of their vows. In 765 St Stephen the Younger was killed, and was later considered a martyr to the Iconophile cause. A number of large monasteries in Constantinople were secularised, and many monks fled to areas beyond effective imperial control on the fringes of the Empire. Constantine's son, Leo IV (775–80), was less rigorous, and for a time tried to mediate between the factions. When he died, his wife Irene took power as regent for her son, Constantine VI (780–97). Though icon veneration does not seem to have been a major priority for the regency government, Irene called an ecumenical council a year after Leo's death, which restored image veneration. This may have been an effort to secure closer and more cordial relations between Constantinople and Rome. Irene initiated a new ecumenical council, ultimately called the Second Council of Nicaea, which first met in Constantinople in 786 but was disrupted by military units faithful to the iconoclast legacy. The council convened again at Nicaea in 787 and reversed the decrees of the previous iconoclast council held at Constantinople and Hieria, and appropriated its title as Seventh Ecumenical Council. Thus there were two councils called the \\"Seventh Ecumenical Council,\\" the first supporting iconoclasm, the second supporting icon veneration. Unlike the iconoclast council, the iconophile council included papal representatives, and its decrees were approved by the papacy. The Orthodox Church considers it to be the last genuine ecumenical council. Icon veneration lasted through the reign of Empress Irene's successor, Nikephoros I (reigned 802–811), and the two brief reigns after his.  Decree of the Second council of Nicaea  On October 13, 787 the Second Council of Nicaea decreed that 'venerable and holy images are to be dedicated in the holy churches of God, namely the image of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ, of our immaculate Lady the holy Theotokos, and of the angels and all the saints. They are to be accorded the veneration of honour, not indeed the true worship paid to the divine nature alone, but in the same way as this is accorded to the life-giving cross, the holy gospels, and other sacred offerings' (trans. Price, The Acts of the Second Council of Nicaea [Liverpool 2018], 564-5, abbreviated).  The second iconoclast period: 814–843  Emperor Leo V the Armenian instituted a second period of Iconoclasm in 815, again possibly motivated by military failures seen as indicators of divine displeasure, and a desire to replicate the military success of Constantine V. The Byzantines had suffered a series of humiliating defeats at the hands of the Bulgarian Khan Krum, in the course of which emperor Nikephoros I had been killed in battle and emperor Michael I Rangabe had been forced to abdicate. In June 813, a month before the coronation of Leo V, a group of soldiers broke into the imperial mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles, opened the sarcophagus of Constantine V, and implored him to return and save the empire. Late 14th-early 15th century icon illustrating the \\"Triumph of Orthodoxy\\" under the Byzantine empress Theodora over iconoclasm in 843. (National Icon Collection 18, British Museum). Soon after his accession, Leo V began to discuss the possibility of reviving iconoclasm with a variety of people, including priests, monks, and members of the senate. He is reported to have remarked to a group of advisors that: > all the emperors, who took up images and venerated them, met their death > either in revolt or in war; but those who did not venerate images all died a > natural death, remained in power until they died, and were then laid to rest > with all honors in the imperial mausoleum in the Church of the Holy > Apostles.Scriptor Incertus 349,1–18, cited by . The torture and martyrdom of the iconophile Bishop Euthymius of Sardeis by the iconoclast Byzantine Emperor Michael II in 824, in a 13th-century manuscript Leo next appointed a \\"commission\\" of monks \\"to look into the old books\\" and reach a decision on the veneration of images. They soon discovered the acts of the Iconoclastic Synod of 754. A first debate followed between Leo's supporters and the clerics who continued to advocate the veneration of icons, the latter group being led by the Patriarch Nikephoros, which led to no resolution. However, Leo had apparently become convinced by this point of the correctness of the iconoclast position, and had the icon of the Chalke gate, which Leo III is fictitiously claimed to have removed once before, replaced with a cross. In 815 the revival of iconoclasm was rendered official by a Synod held in the Hagia Sophia. Leo was succeeded by Michael II, who in an 824 letter to the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious lamented the appearance of image veneration in the church and such practices as making icons baptismal godfathers to infants. He confirmed the decrees of the Iconoclast Council of 754. Michael was succeeded by his son, Theophilus. Theophilus died leaving his wife Theodora regent for his minor heir, Michael III. Like Irene 50 years before her, Theodora presided over the restoration of icon veneration in 843, on the condition that Theophilus not be condemned. Since that time the first Sunday of Great Lent has been celebrated in the Orthodox Church and in Byzantine Rite Catholicism as the feast of the \\"Triumph of Orthodoxy\\". Arguments in the struggle over icons =Iconoclast arguments= This page of the Iconodule Chludov Psalter, illustrates the line \\"They gave me gall to eat; and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink\\" with a picture of a soldier offering Christ vinegar on a sponge attached to a pole. Below is a picture of the last Iconoclast Patriarch of Constantinople, John VII rubbing out a painting of Christ with a similar sponge attached to a pole. John is caricatured, here as on other pages, with untidy straight hair sticking out in all directions, which was meant to portray him as wild and barbaric. Nikephoros I of Constantinople upholding an icon and trampling John VII of Constantinople. Chludov Psalter. What accounts of iconoclast arguments remain are largely found in quotations or summaries in iconodule writings. It is thus difficult to reconstruct a balanced view of the popularity or prevalence of iconoclast writings. The major theological arguments, however, remain in evidence because of the need in iconophile writings to record the positions being refuted. Debate seems to have centred on the validity of the depiction of Jesus, and the validity of images of other figures followed on from this for both sides. The main points of the iconoclast argument were: # Iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image (e.g. painting or statue) that was intended to represent Jesus or one of the saints. The Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum held in 754 declared: > \\"Supported by the Holy Scriptures and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, > in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed > and cursed one of the Christian Church every likeness which is made out of > any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters.... If anyone > ventures to represent the divine image (χαρακτήρ, kharaktír - character) of > the Word after the Incarnation with material colours, he is an adversary of > God. .... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in > lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this > notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent > their virtues as living images in himself, he is an adversary of God\\" # For iconoclasts, the only real religious image must be an exact likeness of the prototype -of the same substance- which they considered impossible, seeing wood and paint as empty of spirit and life. Thus for iconoclasts the only true (and permitted) \\"icon\\" of Jesus was the Eucharist, the Body and Blood of Christ, according to Orthodox and Catholic doctrine. # Any true image of Jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature (which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed) and his human nature (which is possible). But by making an icon of Jesus, one is separating his human and divine natures, since only the human can be depicted (separating the natures was considered nestorianism), or else confusing the human and divine natures, considering them one (union of the human and divine natures was considered monophysitism). # Icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an inappropriate innovation in the Church, and a return to pagan practice. > \\"Satan misled men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the > Creator. The Law of Moses and the Prophets cooperated to remove this > ruin...But the previously mentioned demiurge of evil...gradually brought > back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.\\"Epitome, Iconoclast > Council at Hieria, 754 It was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition, of which there was a written record opposing religious images. The Spanish Synod of Elvira (c. 305) had declared that \\"Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration\\", and some decades later Eusebius of Caesaria may have written a letter to Constantia (Emperor Constantine's sister) saying \\"To depict purely the human form of Christ before its transformation, on the other hand, is to break the commandment of God and to fall into pagan error\\"; Bishop Epiphanius of Salamis wrote his letter 51 to John, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 394) in which he recounted how he tore down an image in a church and admonished the other bishop that such images are \\"opposed … to our religion\\", although the authenticity of this letter has also long been disputed, and remains uncertain. However, as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles with traditions of religious images, and especially after the conversion of Constantine (c. 312), the legalization of Christianity, and, later that century, the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire, many new people came into the new large public churches, which began to be decorated with images that certainly drew in part on imperial and pagan imagery: \\"The representations of Christ as the Almighty Lord on his judgment throne owed something to pictures of Zeus. Portraits of the Mother of God were not wholly independent of a pagan past of venerated mother-goddesses. In the popular mind the saints had come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities.\\"Henry Chadwick, The Early Church (The Penguin History of the Church, 1993), 283. =Iconophile arguments= The chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks Mansur (John of Damascus), who, living in Muslim territory as advisor to the Caliph of Damascus, was far enough away from the Byzantine emperor to evade retribution, and Theodore the Studite, abbot of the Stoudios monastery in Constantinople. John declared that he did not worship matter, \\"but rather the creator of matter.\\" He also declared, \\"But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me, as if filled with divine energy and grace.\\" He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the body and blood of Jesus. This distinction between worship and veneration is key in the arguments of the iconophiles. The iconophile response to iconoclasm included: # Assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of God had been superseded by the incarnation of Jesus, who, being the second person of the Trinity, is God incarnate in visible matter. Therefore, they were not depicting the invisible God, but God as He appeared in the flesh. They were able to adduce the issue of the incarnation in their favour, whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them. They also pointed to other Old Testament evidence: God instructed Moses to make two golden statues of cherubim on the lid of the Ark of the Covenant according to , and God also told Moses to embroider the curtain which separated the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle tent with cherubim . Moses was also instructed by God to embroider the walls and roofs of the Tabernacle tent with figures of cherubim angels according to . # Further, in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons. Essentially the argument was that idols were idols because they represented false gods, not because they were images. Images of Christ, or of other real people who had lived in the past, could not be idols. This was considered comparable to the Old Testament practice of only offering burnt sacrifices to God, and not to any other gods. # Regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images, they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition (parádosis, sanctioned in Catholicism and Orthodoxy as authoritative in doctrine by reference to Basil the Great, etc.), and pointed to patristic writings approving of icons, such as those of Asterius of Amasia, who was quoted twice in the record of the Second Council of Nicaea. What would have been useful evidence from modern art history as to the use of images in Early Christian art was unavailable to iconodules at the time. # Much was made of acheiropoieta, icons believed to be of divine origin, and miracles associated with icons. Both Christ and the Theotokos were believed in strong traditions to have sat on different occasions for their portraits to be painted. # Iconophiles further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor, since portraits of the emperor were common and the iconoclasts did not oppose them. Emperors had always intervened in ecclesiastical matters since the time of Constantine I. As Cyril Mango writes, \\"The legacy of Nicaea, the first universal council of the Church, was to bind the emperor to something that was not his concern, namely the definition and imposition of orthodoxy, if need be by force.\\" That practice continued from beginning to end of the Iconoclast controversy and beyond, with some emperors enforcing iconoclasm, and two empresses regent enforcing the re-establishment of icon veneration. Art 19th-century Italian painting, The Iconoclasts, by Domenico Morelli The iconoclastic period has drastically reduced the number of survivals of Byzantine art from before the period, especially large religious mosaics, which are now almost exclusively found in Italy and Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt. Important works in Thessaloniki were lost in the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 and the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). A large mosaic of a church council in the Imperial Palace was replaced by lively secular scenes, and there was no issue with imagery per se. The plain Iconoclastic cross that replaced a figurative image in the apse of St Irene's is itself an almost unique survival, but careful inspection of some other buildings reveals similar changes. In Nicaea, photographs of the Church of the Dormition, taken before it was destroyed in 1922, show that a pre-iconoclasm standing Theotokos was replaced by a large cross, which was itself replaced by the new Theotokos seen in the photographs. The Image of Camuliana in Constantinople appears to have been destroyed, as mentions of it cease. Reaction in the West The period of Iconoclasm decisively ended the so- called Byzantine Papacy under which, since the reign of Justinian I a century before, the popes in Rome had been initially nominated by, and later merely confirmed by, the emperor in Constantinople, and many of them had been Greek- speaking. By the end of the controversy the pope had approved the creation of a new emperor in the West, and the old deference of the Western church to Constantinople had gone. Opposition to icons seems to have had little support in the West and Rome took a consistently iconodule position. When the struggles flared up, Pope Gregory II had been pope since 715, not long after accompanying his Syrian predecessor Pope Constantine to Constantinople, where they successfully resolved with Justinian II the issues arising from the decisions of the Quinisext Council of 692, which no Western prelates had attended. Of the delegation of 13 Gregory was one of only two non-Eastern; it was to be the last visit of a pope to the city until 1969. There had already been conflicts with Leo III over his very heavy taxation of areas under Roman jurisdiction.

VULTURE first appears in House of Mystery #160 (July 1966), and was created by Jack Miller and Joe Certa. Fictional team history VULTURE first appeared in House of Mystery #160 July (1966), created by Jack Miller and Joe Certa. The organization known as VULTURE was a vast international crime cartel that was infiltrated, thwarted and eventually completely destroyed by J'onn J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter. Their secretive leader had a number of aliases: Mister Vulture, Mister V, and Faceless, but was in reality Marco Xavier. Shortly after retiring his John Jones persona, J'onzz comes into conflict with cartel operatives when he travels to the French Riviera. While in the Riviera he investigates Marco Xavier, an international playboy with supposed links to organized crime. He uses his shape-shifting powers to follow Xavier as he leaves his villa in a high powered sports car. However, Xavier loses control of his vehicle and it plunges off a mountain road, and is apparently killed, his body quickly consumed by the blazing crash. J'onn takes advantage of this accident by quickly transforming himself into a Xavier lookalike, and lowers himself from the branch of a cliffside tree before the police arrive. The disguised \\"Marco Xavier\\" is taken to his villa to recover. Slowly but surely and using his disguise as Marco Xavier, the Martian Manhunter works his way up through the cartel. While maintaining the original Marco's role as an outside contractor uninterested in joining Vulture, he is eventually able to smash the group from the inside. J'onn took over the Xavier identity in order to infiltrate VULTURE and they became his main adversaries for the fourteen issues spanning House of Mystery #160-173 (March–April 1968), the final installment in the Martian's original solo feature. Finally, VULTURE maneuvered the Martian Manhunter as Marco Xavier into committing a crime which saw the false playboy hunted as a criminal across Europe. \\"Xavier\\" was conveniently rescued by VULTURE and brought before Faceless, who asserted that he knew about the Martian Manhunter's double identity the entire time. Faceless unmasked to reveal himself as the true Marco Xavier, claiming to have allowed the masquerade to continue in order to lure the Manhunter into the perfect trap (the only explanation for how he survived the car crash was that he 'planned in advance'). Xavier had determined that the Martian Manhunter was vulnerable to fire, and used it to tame the hero before attempting to finish him off with an experimental handgun. Instead, the weapon malfunctioned, seemingly evaporating Xavier, and leaving the Martian Manhunter to sift through the rubble. To date, Faceless and VULTURE have yet to resurface. Yet, their disappearance left a trail of unanswered questions, including whether the original Marco Xavier was in fact the ultimate Faceless, or if perhaps the organization had simply covered its tracks once again. VULTURE appears to be experts of molecular mutation. The American branch's invention has the ability to temporarily transform ordinary men into indestructible giants (House of Mystery #166). An underground branch created beams that can change people into purple-skinned were-creatures (that can breathe fire) and back again (House of Mystery #169) that are used for crime sprees.

The area features heavily in the accounts of David Livingstone's journeys in Central Africa.  Establishing Zambia  Livingstone's exploration of the region coincided with an increased interest in missions in the Evangelical churches in Britain, and, despite his complicated motives, Livingstone became the darling of Evangelical expansion. This interest was largely influenced by, > \\"the result of revivalism among Pietists and Methodists and among the > Evangelicals of the Anglican church. People wanted to convert others to the > same joyous religious experience they had had\\".Cairns 181: 401 The rise in missionary zeal was heightened with the expansion of European empires, opening up unknown territories and bringing other cultures to the attention of the newly formed mission societies. Yet another element of this increased mission activity was the desire not to see a repeat of the recent Indian Mutiny, that the Evangelicals, like Livingstone, felt was, \\"as a result of too little mission activity\\".Ferguson 2004: 154 It is possible the cause of the mutiny was actually of a religious origin with many of the Indians serving in the British Indian Army convinced, \\"that the British did indeed have plans to Christianize India\\",Ferguson 2004: 145 and thereby threatening their faith that was in their view indivisible from their vocation as a soldier, whether as a Hindu, Muslim or Sikh. Livingstone inspired many Evangelicals in his speech at the Senate House in Cambridge University in 1857 in which he stated, > \\"I consider we made a great mistake when we carried commerce into India, in > being ashamed of our Christianity… those two pioneers of civilisation – > Christianity and commerce – should ever be inseparable\\". He concluded the speech with the call, > \\"I go back to Africa to make an open path for Commerce and Christianity; do > you carry out the work I have begun. I leave it with you\\".Ferguson 2004: 155 Following Livingstone's death in 1873, at Ilala by the shores of Lake Bangweulu in North Eastern Zambia, and the subsequent development of preventatives and cures for malaria based on quinine, mission societies stepped in to take up where he had left off by establishing Christianity in Central Africa. In a report on the Church and development in Zambia the London Missionary Society (LMS) was the first organisation to establish a mission station based at Niamikolo close to Lake Tanganyika in 1885PAG 2000: 3 followed by numerous other mission stations throughout the country. Part of the reason for the rapid spread of these stations was their acceptance among some of the smaller tribes of the northern region of Zambia. They perceived that the, \\"missionaries… would provide effective protection\\",PAG 2000:4 from attackers, such as the more powerful Bemba tribe. Other mission stations followed the LMS example and established a presence in other regions. Examples include the Paris Evangelical Mission at Lealui 1892, The Primitive Methodists working among the Illa people in Western Zambia in 1892, the Presbyterians at Mwenzo in 1894. After independence in 1965 these four mission societies were to merge their works and become known as the United Church of Zambia (UCZ). Zambia's increased mission activity was not an isolated case though, globally the number of missionaries rose dramatically during this period. \\"By the end of the century there were as many as 12,000 British missionaries \\"in the field\\", representing no less than 360 different societies and other bodies\\".Ferguson 2004: 160 In shaping Zambia's Christianity, it is important that the influence of the Roman Catholic Church is noted. The, \\"Catholic Church [is] by far the most influential denomination,\\"Gifford 1999: 183 in the nation. Catholic missionaries first established a mission in 1895 among the Bemba tribe. The Bemba tribe had traditionally been hostile to church activity, partly due to the resistance to settlement by Europeans, but also because their presence strengthened the resolve of rival ethnic groups to resist the Bemba. With the death of the Bemba king Chitimukulu Sampa Kapalakasha and his replacement by a less antagonistic king the way was open for the Catholic White Fathers to establish the mission in the area that was to become the Copperbelt Province of Northern Zambia. In Southern Zambia the Catholic mission activity was undertaken by Jesuit Fathers in the early years of the twentieth centuryPAG; 2000, 5-6 along with the Franciscan friars. Zambia still retains the historical divisions of this early Catholic mission activity; the county is still divided into diocese administered by each of these groups. The first Anglican mission station would not begin until 1911. This was established by Leonard Kamungu, a priest from Malawi, at Msoro. Kamungu perhaps reflects an aspect of Christianity that set it apart from many of the other structures of colonialism that severely limited if not actively restricted the ability of the local population to take a part in their development, becoming isolated and voiceless from the ruling European elite. > \\"Though white settlers ... were able to organize themselves in Formal > groups… the colonial authorities provided little space for urban indigenous > people to formally organize. Although there was some tolerance of group > activity under the umbrella of the church.Howell & Pearce 2002: 179-180 Traditional Anglican involvement in Zambia was undertaken by the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), which had been founded in Cambridge as a direct result of the fiftieth anniversary of Livingstone's call for African evangelism. Though unlike many of Livingstone's original audience the UMCA held to a less Evangelical and more Anglo-Catholic form of Christian theology. Consequently, although highly influential, despite its small numbers, modern- day Anglicanism in Zambia does not have the Evangelical fervour that is evident elsewhere in modern-day African nations that were formally British colonial possessions. Livingstone, though certainly at the vanguard of the colonisers, and in that capacity he spelled the end to traditional Zambian society, he is still held in high regard by many contemporary Zambian's. This perhaps reflects an understanding of Livingstone as less of a coloniser and more as a bringer of the Christian faith that today over seventy five percent,Gifford 1999, Smith 1999 more recent surveys put it as high as eighty- five percent,Johnstone & Mandryk 2001; 686 of the population embrace in one form or another. Christianity is still, \\"growing at a rate of nearly 4 percent per year\\",Phiri 1999: 325 in a nation with an annual average population growth rate of 2.7 percent from 1990–99.World Bank: 2001 279 Possibly some of this affection is also because Livingstone is perceived as a defender of the traditional societies as he defied the slave traders who were already destroying communities; one of his multiple motives for being in the region was anti-slavery and towards the end of his life a primary drive in his work. Though, as with many interventions of this nature, the possible motives were not as philanthropic as they first appeared to those under threat. Livingstone saw the oppressed communities as a basis for his \\"potential village preaching centres\\",Cairns 1981: 403 to spread the gospel and in so doing provide a stable base for European culture. Like much of what Livingstone undertook the reality is complex and in many of his wanderings he was actually forced to rely on the slave trade's logistical networks.Ferguson 2004: 159 Again Livingstone's legacy lives on in many development initiatives undertaken on the continent both in religious and secular capacities, a seemingly positive intervention, which carries wider motives and implications. Colonial era During the period of colonial rule in Zambia, up until independence in 1964, the church attempted to straddle the gulf between ministering to the needs of the local population without antagonising the colonial administration and bringing the local population to a point of passive acceptance of colonial rule. The administration viewed church activity as a possibly practical tool of indoctrination, but at times a vehicle for dissent against colonial rule too. The traditional view of the Church during this period was to provide social welfare. Churches became primarily involved in education and healthcare.Gifford 1999: 189 Other initiatives such as orphanages, skills training and agricultural extension were also evident in the development of Zambia during this period. Though at times its role extended into advocacy and the formulation of law and the penal code. In the matter of healthcare the churches saw the provision of affordable healthcare as vital to a population that could not afford private medical treatment. Even in current-day Zambia, the Catholic Church alone is running 15 hospitals, 28 health centres, 54 home based care institutions.PAG: 2000 25 The provision of healthcare had a twofold motivation. Firstly, there was the concern driven by Biblical principles of care for the incapacitated. Examples include the parable of the Good Samaritan Luke 10:25-37, then Jesus' encouragement in Matthew 25:36 \\"I was sick and you looked after me, \\" and the Old Testament reprimand to the leaders of Israel, \\"you have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured,\\" Ezk 34:4, Secondly, it was driven by a perception that the only alternative medical care available to the local population involved traditional healers and their use of, in colonial eyes, unscientific and crude methods as well as possible appeals to animistic or ancestral powers. These latter elements were of particular concern in ecclesiastical circles as, the Church has generally tried to change or discourage cultural practices that are contrary to Christian teaching.PAG: 2000, 31 Christian missions were at the forefront of social change in Zambia. On the question of traditional penal codes, that were either considered too lenient or too harsh depending on the change the missions wished to see imposed, as opposed to a legal code more in line with that in Britain the Church was instrumental in pushing through reform.Chanock 1985: 128 The involvement of missionaries was \\"more than providing correctives – spiritual or otherwise… their real ambition was power\\".Smith 1999: 529 Generally though healthcare had impact on indigenous society it was seen as a reasonably neutral activity by the colonial authorities. Education on the other hand would prove to be a little more of a double edged sword for the colonial administration. Paradoxically, as the state sought to control education policy by taking out of the hands of the churches so the clamour for the demise of colonial rule, from a mission educated local population, rose. Schools were often found associated with the mission stations. The prime focus of education was on rural areas and the schools themselves retained the flavour of the particular denomination that had established them. Though the PAG report notes, \\"the exception was to be found on the Copperbelt where the formation of the United Missions in the Copperbelt in the 1930s ushered in inter-denominational schools.\\"2000: 9 The schools usually offered a rudimentary education in basic reading, Bible study and practical subjects beyond this it was felt the local population would have little use for higher education as it could lead to isolation from their communities. Once more the Bible provided a precedent for missionaries to involve themselves in education, \\"train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it,\\" Proverbs 22:6. For the missionaries the practical outworking of this exhortation in Zambia was threefold: # As a means to evangelism. The Evangelical churches in particular saw the personal study of the Bible as a vital part of the discipleship of converts to Christianity. Therefore, the ability to read was vital to this concept (It also meant that the Church was at the forefront of recording African aural languages so as to produce translated scriptures). All denominations though perceived that giving the children a Biblical education would draw them away from the traditional instruction in the village. # Education was also seen as a method by which European values and culture could be instilled into the population. # Formal education would also provide skilled workers for the mission station. Church workers, construction workers, teachers etc. Later they would also provide skilled labour for commerce, government and the mines.Weller & Linden, 1984 The concept of providing only basic education, as was the case with many mission schools, was called into question following a revolt in Malawi in 1918 in which mission trained teachers and former students played a part. The colonial authorities felt that education needed a more formal basis, to be under closer scrutiny and to provide greater openings for the more apt pupils. \\"The government introduced a proclamation which demanded the registration of schools [and]… empowered magistrates and Native Commissioners to inspect schools.\\"PAG 2000: 9 By 1922 the General Missionary Conference passed a resolution calling for the \\"establishment of one or more government colleges or institutions to provide instruction in agriculture, forestry, pedagogy and the duties of chiefs.\\"PAG: 2000: 10 Further to this the \\"institution [was] to be under the management of a joint council of the nominees or the Administration and representatives of the missions\\", setting the precedent for partnership between the state and church in education. From the 1920s onwards there was to be a gradual erosion of the church's primacy in education in Zambia. Understanding the need for increased professionalism among its staff the Anglican Church \\"closed all its schools for 18 months between 1918 and 1920 and brought all their teachers to Msoro for retraining.\\"PAG 2000: 8 The Advisory Board devised the Native School Code by 1927 establishing the state as the arbiter of educational standards in Zambia. The state now had the power to deregister schools that did not operate for the prescribed number of days in a year or did not cover adequately the curriculum developed by the Board. The number of registered mission schools declined significantly during this period. \\"Of the 547 schools run by the White Fathers only 17 qualified as schools under the new conditions.\\"Carmody 1999: 44 Part of the reason that the Copperbelt Schools were inter-denominational was the pressure from the Board not to allow contending schools to open up in the towns and repeat the rivalry that was prevalent elsewhere leading to small villages with two schools run by competing missions. Following the Second World War the government opened its own schools in some provinces. This event was to draw the Christian denominations and indigenous authorities together in a consensus on education in an attempt to reinforce their positions. Some Churches saw the government policy as an attempt to secularise education and resisted the move openly. In 1951 Local Education Authorities (LEA) were established to take control of government schools and were also authorised to take control of any mission schools that the indigenous authorities, mission societies or any other voluntary organisation no longer wanted to administer. Many of the Protestant missions handed their schools over. \\"By 1963 – the dawn of Zambia's independence – 800 of the 2,100 schools were L.E.A while the rest were mainly agency schools 30 per cent of which were operated by the Catholics.\\"PAG 2000: 14 Despite their decline the mission schools had become the place where the aspiration for independence was established and nurtured, as well as promoting colonial structure they had also encouraged critical thinking enabling students to contest the status quo. \\"It was the mission centres that became the birthplace of post-war African nationalism.\\"Phiri 1999: 329-30 In the wider context the churches had also to become advocates for the people who congregated their buildings for worship and populated their parishes. Although an outside agency they were equipped and informed enough and had sufficient influence both in Zambia and back in Britain to intercede for those who had little voice in the colonial political system. It would not be until after independence that indigenous or even international NGOs would have a comparable voice. Phiri states, \\"since churches remain 'zones of freedom' and in some cases more or less a 'state within a state', they tend to take up the political functions of repressed organizations. This leads to confrontation with the state.1999: 324 Weller & Linden cite a Catholic missionary who reported that a missionary from the Presbyterian mission was compelled to complain \\"to the Foreign Office in London about the behaviour of the company's officials in his area. Villages burnt, and chiefs and headmen put in chains, in order to intimidate them into sending their people to do carrier service.\\"1984: 191 In fact one of the briefs of the General Missionary Council was \\"to watch over the interests of the Native races.\\"PAG 2000: 33 Churches were to involve themselves in diverse campaigns such as poll tax reform, the effects on families due to labour migration and issues of racial inequality. During this period there was a rise in African Indigenous Churches (AICs). These churches were founded and run by Zambian's who either defected from the mission churches dissatisfied with their European bias or their stayed theology or they were founded during the labour migrations of the 1920s into the Copperbelt. \\"Among the labourers were Africans who had been introduced to Christianity in their home regions and who, upon discovering no church whatsoever in the Copperbelt, decided to start a church themselves – one that was entirely directed and sustained by Africans.\\"Smith 1999: 532 also.PAG 2000: 38 It was AICs that would be the initial breeding grounds for nationalist sentiments, and it was this fervour that crept over the denominational lines through informal contacts and into the more politically powerful mainline churches. The imposition of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953 brought some of these issues to a head. In Zambia it was felt that the Federation exacerbate the issues of racial inequality and economically favoured Zimbabwe over Zambia and Malawi. The Christian Council of Northern Rhodesia, that had replaced the General Missionary Conference in 1944, stated its position clearly when it wrote: > \\"Under normal circumstances the Church is bound to support the State and the > forces aimed as preserving law and order, but this obligation is qualified > by the Church's higher loyalty to the law of God. Where the State is > misusing its Stewardship of power; where it is not adequately fulfilling its > function of protecting the God-given freedom of all its citizens; where it > is favouring one section of the community to the detriment of the others, > then a Christian is called to protest ad to take whatever action is > compatible with the Christian Gospel.\\"Weller & Linden 1984: 199 The imposition of the Federation was a response by Britain to shore up an empire it could no longer maintain after the war. In its attempts to preserve its power the colonial government alienated the churches as some of the most powerful civil society groups in the nation, prompting open opposition to its policies. It would not be long before this rift allied with an educated Zambian elite would bring about calls for Zambian independence. It was a lesson that would not be lost on future governments. Independence The drive for an independent Zambia found a secure home in the churches. \\"The Christian Church… formed a crucial part of the associational landscape in many Sub-Saharan countries, consisting not only of a forum for spiritual communication but also a sanctuary for secular resistance.\\"Howell & Pearce 2002: 182 Phiri noted that \\"the mission centres provided a place where the contradictions between Christianity and the politics of racism and colonialism could be discussed in relative freedom… The effect of this was that the anti- colonial struggle in Zambia was clearly driven by Christian beliefs and packaged in Christian social action.\\"1999: 330 The Lumpa Church was established in 1954 by Alice Lenshina, from a village near Lubwa Mission in Chinsali District of Northern Province of Zambia. It quickly spread to the whole of Northern Province, Eastern Province and the Copperbelt, was an AIC. It staid aloof of the nationalist struggle against the colonial rule. This led to the accusation that the Church was actually opposing the struggle as recently had been initiated by the ANC and later UNIP. The main aim of the Lumpa Church was to clean the country of witchcraft. This message was very popular. She helped also to reintegrate widows who could get important positions in her church, for example as prayer leaders or as church choir leaders. Lenshina's movement had specifically spiritual roots, she was \\"a peasant woman who claimed to have died and risen again.\\" Encouraged by Fergus Macpherson, the Scottish missionary of Lubwa Mission to share her story she gathered a large following and formed an independent church. The rapid rise of the Lumpa church and its reluctance to involve itself with anti-colonial struggle led to violent conflicts with the UNIP youth in Chinsali District and then later also with colonial authorities. In 1963 the new majority government with Kenneth Kaunda as prime minister send the army into the district to restore order and to capture Lenshina. Sporadic clashes became an open war, in which the official death toll was 1,111, although it was probably much largerGifford 1999: 184 Lenshina surrendered herself to the army and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Lumpa Church was banned. Tens of thousands of her followers fled to the Congo. The Church only reappeared after the fall of Kaunda in 1988. Much of the latter conflict with the Lumpa Church had been undertaken by the transitional government formed to take over from the colonial administration in 1964. This transitional government was led by Kenneth Kaunda. Kaunda was himself a product of the mission schools,Kaunda 1962: 5-18 as was his father, David, who was \\"a well-educated Malawian preacher and schoolteacher… who moved to Zambia as a missionary.\\"Phiri 1999: 330 Kaunda would emphasize his Christian roots, especially in the lead up to independence and in the early years of his presidency. \\"I was brought up in a Christian home and my Christian belief is part of me now. It is still my habit to turn to God in prayer asking for his guidance.\\"Kaunda 1962:146Gifford 1999: 191 His Christian beliefs ensured the colonial administration were favourably disposed towards Kaunda and the United National Independence Party (UNIP) that he led. His faith also bought him wide support in the churches both African and European led. However, Kaunda also emphasised that it was his understanding of the Bible's teachings that led him to conclude that colonialism \\"was immoral because it denied Africans their God-given dignity\\".Phiri 1999: 331 Though the church was the seedbed for much of the nationalism that brought about independence in Zambia, Phiri notes that the freedoms that nationalism wrought were to allow other secular civil society associations to ease the church aside as the main source of opposition to colonial rule.1999: 331-2 With Kaunda's declarations of faith and independence the church retracted from the political sphere, merely lending support to the government policies when necessary.Phiri 1999: 333 Phiri maintains that this demonstrates the reverse of the phenomenon that Bayart observed in Cameroon in which \\"churches often replace the manifestly political institutions in certain of their functions. When civil society is repressed by a predatory state, a vacuum occurs in the political system.\\" Phiri indicates that the relative freedoms of political association and the improved public spending initiatives of the early years of UNIP rule1999: 332 caused the Church to return to a more traditional pastoral role. Others, such as Gifford,1999: 341-344 suggest that Bayart's observations are too generalised and were specific in geographical and chronological reference only to Cameroon at the time Bayart made them. Therefore, it is difficult to translate these interpretations either to newly independent Zambia or even to the present day circumstances. In 1972 the political freedoms declined markedly and this was rapidly followed by economic volatility as well. In response to, Simon Kapwepwe, the former Vice- President's attempt to form an alternative political party to UNIP Kaunda's government declared Zambia a one party state. The following year Zimbabwe closed its borders to \\"all Zambian exports, except copper, which adversely affected the economy\\".Mthembu-Salter 2003: 1196 Exports were diverted through Tanzania and Angola, but in 1974 the outbreak of civil war in Angola was to have a further impact on the Zambian economy. At this time the price of copper, accounting for 95% of Zambia's export earnings,USAID 2003 began to fall dramatically. By 1976 Kaunda was forced to declare a state of emergency and the dramatic dip in revenue caused the UNIP government to borrow heavily, significantly increasing Zambia's external debt. The worsening economic situation and increasing debt led the IMF to intervene in the 1980s to shore up the economy and impose Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) on Zambia. Kaunda only survived politically with the return and reconciliation with Kapwepwe in 1978. During this period there was also a shift in the power and politics in Zambian ecclesiastical life. The churches began to assemble around three representative bodies: The Episcopal Conference of Zambia (ECZ), the Christian Council of Zambia (CCZ) and the Evangelical Fellowship of Zambia (EFZ). The ECZ was a unified voice for the component elements of the Roman Catholic Church; the CCZ was largely the traditional Protestant mission churches, the UCZ, the Anglicans etc. and the EFZ was started by the Baptists as a more Evangelical body, but as the years have passed has become increasingly Pentecostal.Gifford 1999: 188 Following independence the colonial mission churches came under pressure from two fronts. The first was a growth in AICs that \\"split off from mission churches, usually because of perceived racism, or… to incorporate local elements that the mission churches would not countenance.\\"Brouwer, Gifford & Rose 1996: 164 The second came from the influx of missionaries, especially from the United States, who were sent by Pentecostal and Charismatic churches. The emphasis on the miraculous and an acknowledgement of the impact of the spiritual realm on the physical world had a great impact in Africa, where \\"the traditional culture of African society… draws little distinction between the spiritual and the temporal.\\" The growth in the AICs in particular and probably the memory of the Lumpa uprising caused Kaunda to impose \\"a ban on the registration of new churches\\", in 1988 to \\"stem what he considered to be an 'unprecedented establishment of breakaway churches'\\".Smith 1999: 526 This move though was indicative of a widening gap between the church and state in regards to the economic policies, political ideologies and personal life of Kaunda. During the late 1960s the UNIP government embarked on a more radical socialist agenda which became known as Scientific Socialism. This move alarmed the wider Christian community of Zambia fearing that it could lead to Marxist Humanism in the nation. The ECZ, CCZ and EFZ took the unusual step of issuing \\"a joint statement entitled Marxism, Humanism and Christianity\\". The government fearing a backlash from the public toned down its policies. Phiri comments on this episode, \\"the churches discerned that the UNIP was adopting socialism not necessarily because of an ideological change of heart, but as another method of control.\\"1999: 334 The success of the combined pressure prompted the three bodies to continue to work closely in terms of public policy, which Gifford goes on to note \\"makes Zambian Christianity… virtually unique on the continent\\" in that \\"the co-operation includes Pentecostals.\\"1999:188 The ideological tensions rose again when Kaunda identified his personal political philosophy as \\"Zambian Humanism\\". To Kaunda it was the coming together of his Christian ethics and the values of traditional African society. However, Kaunda's newly expounded philosophical outlook ran headlong into the theological outlook of the churches of the EFZ that were being heavily influenced by the new missionary movement from the United States. Gifford notes that Kaunda's \\"idealistic and utopian combination\\" endured the anger of the EFZ influenced by \\"American Evangelism [for whom] the word humanism carried the worst of connotations\\",1999: 191 Colin Morris, an English Methodist missionary in Zambia who was a friend and strong supporter of Kaunda, described Kaunda's beliefs as syncretistic: \\"he can make himself a cathedral, mosque, temple or synagogue with an ease that makes nonsense of religious divisions.\\"1966: 11 By now Kaunda had lost the trust of the churches who regarded him as a \\"renegade Christian presiding over a corrupt and oppressive government\\".Gifford 1999: 193 The churches refused to co-operate with the 1976 education reforms believing that because of socialism, \\"government's educational ideology was atheistic\\".PAG 2000: 15 The harshness of the SAPs was to cause serious food riots in Zambia during the last years of the UNIP government when subsidies on staples, such as maize meal, were removed. Kaunda was often forced to back-pedal and reinstate the subsidies. In doing so the UNIP government incurred the wrath of the IMF who blacklisted Zambia on the international financial markets, so furthering its poverty. With the halcyon days of post-independence free education and health now in the past the poor in particular needed to look elsewhere for help. Shao says, \\"when a government is unable to build a clinic in a village, the people's tendency is to look to the church for help.\\"2001: 20 the same was true in Zambia at this period. With the waning of Kaunda's star the power of churches was in the ascendancy again and any serious challenger to Kenneth Kaunda would need to show indisputable Christian credentials. The Church and the Christian Nation The political unrest in Zambia, including food riots in which 30 people died and an attempted coup, resulted in a call for multi-party democracy. \\"The demand for Democracy in many countries in Africa, including Zambia, was also an expression of opposition to the effects of structural adjustment.\\"Simutanyi 1996: 825 The beleaguered Kaunda capitulated and called a referendum. In mid 1990, \\"The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), an unofficial alliance of political opponents of the Government, was formed\\"Mthembu-Salter 2003: 1197 under the leadership of the recently ousted Finance Minister Arthur Wina and the leader of the Zambian trade unions, Frederick Chiluba, to fight the democratic corner in the referendum. Kaunda then postponed the referendum by a year, but by then the momentum was too strong even in his own party. By the end of 1990 Kaunda announced that multi- party elections would be held in October 1991. The \\"MMD chose not to disband into many small parties that could easily be defeated by the UNIP. Instead the MMD registered as one party and elected the popular trade unionist Fredrick Chiluba as its presidential candidate.\\"Phiri 1999: 341 Though the churches steered a careful course so as not to actively promote any party Phiri notes that \\"pro-democracy political sermons became frequent in many churches,\\" but concludes, \\"despite their bias towards change, the Churches commendably maintained a non-partisan role, emerging as critical agents of reconciliation during critical times.\\" 1999: 341 Churches were to hold days of prayer for the election process, including election night itself, and, \\"in the few months before the elections, the churches made probably their greatest contribution to a peaceful transition. They joined to form the Christian Churches Monitoring Group, which then became the Zambia Elections Monitoring Coordinating Committee (ZEMEC), which set out to train a grassroots army to observe procedures at all polling stations on election day.\\"Gifford 1999: 196 Jimmy Carter who led the international team of observers notes that at a time of \\"political impasse\\", between Chiluba and Kaunda the Anglican Cathedral in Lusaka provided the \\"acceptable meeting place for both parties. Their meeting, which began with shared prayer, resulted eventually in a redrafting of the constitution that opened the way for the elections.\\"1994: vii Chiluba later credited Carter as being sent from God.Christian Vision 1992 Christians wary of Kaunda's somewhat unorthodox theological positions in the past were further antagonised when the President began openly flirting with Eastern Religious beliefs. The growing perception in Zambia was \\"that Kaunda had not just forsaken true Christianity, but had fallen under the sway of Eastern gurus… in the 1980s he became linked with a Dr M. A. Ranganathan and established his David Universal Temple at State House.\\" Phiri states that the association with \\"Eastern Religions… was not acceptable to Zambian Christians.\\"Phiri 2003: 405 The tensions caused by the perceived drift of Kaunda from Christian orthodoxy were exacerbated when Kaunda alleged \\"churches were preaching hatred\\" in response to negative articles about his regime in two Christian publications. Possibly in an attempt to antagonise the churches even more Kaunda joined with a television project with the Marharishi Mahesh Yogi launching a scheme to make Zambia \\"Heaven on Earth\\"\\" Meditation guru and Zambian strongman Philadelphia Inquirer, 18 Oct 24 October 1991 Kaunda was forced in a television interview to deny practising Transcendental Meditation., this was televised on the state-run channel days before polling. Gifford notes that the response by senior pastors from Ndola, the principal town of the Copperbelt, was to call the project \\"demonic\\" and they \\"deplored the fact that the government 'had banned the registration of more churches but permitted occult systems to enter Zambia'\\".1999: 192 Smith observes that Fredrick Chiluba \\"was situated quite differently than Kaunda – politically and religiously speaking. Politically speaking he symbolised a new generation.\\"1999: 537 not caught up in the dogma of the colonialism verses nationalism debate of Kaunda, but representing the developmental needs of Zambia. In the run up to the elections Chiluba was to use the rift between Kaunda and Christians to his advantage by emphasising his Christianity. He \\"stressed (and his supporters stressed even more) his impeccable credentials as a true spirit-filled believer. Christian motifs were introduced into the political struggle – the diminutive Chiluba being frequently referred to as David challenging Goliath, and even more frequently as Moses, about to bring his people to freedom after almost forty years of fruitless wanderings in the wilderness.\\" Phiri states that \\"Chiluba gained the support of the churches [while] Kaunda simultaneously lost his.\\" At the election on 31 October 1991, Fredrick Chiluba \\"received 75.79% of the votes cast\\" and the MMD won 125 of the 150 seats in the national assembly in elections that, \\"international observers reported… had been conducted fairly\\". Haynes states that this was \\"brought about in part due to the perception that the previous government under K. Kaunda threatened the Church\\".1996: 97-98 Though opposition to SAPs had led to the elections the candidate's personalities their religious beliefs might have masked the economic concerns. Simutanyi notes that \\"during the election campaign the question of the economy was not given serious attention.\\" The excitement elicited among ordinary Zambians at the opportunity to elect a party of their choice enabled the \\"erstwhile opponents of structural adjustment\\" to change political horses midstream and present their rendering of SAPs \\"as a panacea for Zambia' s economic problems… ordinary people showed open support for austerity. For example, at an MMD rally addressed by Chiluba in Kabwe in August 1990, Chiluba asked his audience if they would be prepared for sacrifices when the MMD came to power. They chanted 'YES.'\\"1996: 829 Of course, by embracing SAPs Chiluba and the MMD also ensured that they would be viewed favourably by the IMF and international finance community should they gain power. Chiluba quotes a conversation he had with Jimmy Carter just before the election, \\"he says 'what you say today will matter tomorrow, you have to be very mindful every word you utter should have meaning.'\\"Christian Vision: 1992 These words would come back to haunt Chiluba as his presidency unfolded. Two months after the election Chiluba called for a \\"celebration of praise\\", at State House at which he declared on national television that Zambia was a Christian nation. Phiri speculates that Chiluba's declaration was a personal commitment to God as president that he would lead Zambia guided by his principles based on his Christian faith. \\"One of my informants, Melu, felt that, as far as the president was concerned, the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation was not a political statement… it was some thing he believed he needed to do.\\"2003: 408 Phiri had previously stated that Chiluba \\"often draws little distinction between his personal religious faith and his public role as president\\".1999: 343 Gifford on the other hand sees the declaration as a chance by the Pentecostal and Evangelical Churches to gain an upper hand in politics in Zambia. \\"Following the announcement, there was general euphoria on the past of many born-agains.\\"1999:198 The ECZ and CCZ response was muted as they had not been consulted before the declaration. Gifford suggests, \\"Chiluba may have contacted officials of the EFZ, who no doubt were reluctant to bring in the other bodies because they saw this as their hour, having in the past felt themselves slightly overshadowed by the ECZ and CCZ.\\" Chiluba's patronage of the Evangelical wing of the church continued as he \\"appointed born-again pastors to government posts\\".Gifford 1999: 201 \\"Chiluba was reported to have distributed 140 million kwacha to some of these churches during the 1996 election campaign in the hope of solidifying their political support. Chiluba has offered other perks to churches towards this end as well, including issuing diplomatic passports to clergy… and allocating building plots to churches.\\"Smith 1999: 537 He and Godfrey Miyanda, who began as Minister without Portfolio and later became Vice President, could be \\"found 'preaching' to church constituencies at mass rallies, church fund-raising events and Sunday church services\\",Smith 1999: 539 though Gifford notes of this latter practice \\"in Zambia, it would be hard for a President to do otherwise.\\"1999:201 Phiri also noted that \\"there was an influx of Christian missionaries into Zambia. New charismatic churches or church organisations increased.\\"2003: 409 This is hardly surprising as the Pentecostal church in particular was keen to promote Chiluba's Christian nation. A video produced by Christian Vision talks of Chiluba in terms similar to the account of Joseph in Genesis saying, \\"this man who only a decade ago languished in a Zambian gaol has found God, found freedom, found the support of his people and has been voted president of his country by a massive majority. Shattering the chains of economic stagnation, of increasing poverty and spiritual darkness\\", and aimed to encourage Western Christians to invest money and skills into Zambia based on its status as a Christian nation. It is clear that the motives for Chiluba's declaration are somewhat ambiguous. On one hand Chiluba was calling on God for divine blessing on Zambia at the declaration he quoted 2 Chron 7:14 saying \\"If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn form their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and forgive their sin and will heal their land\\", and as Phiri speculates, \\"one of the reasons why Zambia was declared a Christian nation was Chiluba's belief that a nation whose leader fears God prospers economically.2003: 411 This interpretation of the Bible is heavily influenced by the US faith prosperity teachings that were gaining influence in Zambia, through missionaries, overseas contacts and increasingly by the means of mass media. \\"American sources and missionaries are systematically flooding the continent and forming a crucial, dynamic part of the African revival.\\"Brouwer, Gifford & Rose 1996: 168-169 Gifford comments, \\"the faith paradigm has become widely accepted as Christianity, and is staple fare on Zambian television.\\"1999:232 Chiluba had an understanding of how Pentecostal churches view his presidency as God appointed. Rev. Sky Banda as senior Pentecostal pastor in the nation says of Chiluba, \\"when he finally got into the presidentship position we were very happy. We felt it was a God-ordained situation.\\"Christian Vision 2003 Haynes proposes, \\"independent churches… theologically towards the conservative end of the religious spectrum, regarded government as divinely sanctioned, that they rule because God allows them to.\\"1998: 117 By using scriptures such as Romans 13:1a, \\"Everyone must summit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.\\" Chiluba was confident he would be able to push his harsh economic policies through with little opposition from the Pentecostal wing of the church. An even more powerful inference in Pentecostal terms was that his presidency was like that of an Old Testament king. Using a scripture, \\"the Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master the Lord's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord\\", 1 Sam 24:5, often appropriated by Pentecostal faith prosperity teachers to hide excesses in their ministry and prevent serious investigation,Hand 1997:50 he and his supporters were able to fend off difficult questions from Pentecostal quarters, see also.Phiri 2003: 406 With this seemingly sound scriptural backing Chiluba was able to ask of his Christian supporters to endure hardships beyond those that brought the UNIP government of Kaunda to its knees. Calling once more on faith prosperity doctrines, \\"Chiluba admonished Christians to 'work hard and not to continue begging because there was not poverty in heaven'.\\" Phiri questioned whether Chiluba's actions were in fact in keeping with his former beliefs as a trade unionist, \\"the characteristics of liberal democracy as understood by Chiluba were not put into practice when he declared Zambia a Christian nation.\\"2003: 424 Because of his seemingly unassailable position the MMD threw themselves whole heartedly into an adjustment programme. Haynes comments that the programme \\"was so stringent that the local World Bank representative counselled caution and urged that greater concern be given to the issue of social instability, which he judged to be a direct result of too fervent an application of adjustment policies\\".1996: 210 The policy left many unemployed, raise the price of basic foods with the removal of subsidies (an action that had caused major riots under Kaunda) and increased the cost of education and healthcare.Phiri 1999: 345 The application of this programme was to have a huge impact on the population and it was to finally cause a rift between Chiluba and the church. Phiri states it, \\"contributed to the worsening of the economic standards of 80 percent of Zambians\\".2003: 425 Once more as hardship threatened the population the church was compelled to take up an advocacy role instigating, \\"conflict between Chiluba and the churches… [due to] the social impact of his economic policies\\" This was a crucial moment in the relationship between Chiluba and the church because, \\"the sustainability of economic policies depends to a large extent of the balance of power between groups supporting and those against.\\"Simutanyi 1996: 830 The surprise declaration of the Christian nation had already alienated the CCZ and ECZ and they became increasing less likely to fully support Chiluba just because he was a Christian. The declaration eventually estranged many of the women of Zambia, who had enthusiastically supported Chiluba in 1991, but later felt that he was \\"not gender sensitive and… wonder[ed] whether this had anything to do with the fact that Zambia… [had] been declared a Christian nation.\\"Phiri 2003: 418 Illustrating what Aboum suggests, \\"the relationship between the church and Women is contradictory. On the one had, the Church empowers women, and on the other, it has been slow in applying the revolutionary message of good news for women within its own structures.\\"2001: 125 Put simply, \\"the Church has an empowering role, but a marginalising structure.\\"CAPA 2001: 10 As the economic hardships increased churches came under greater pressure both to provide welfare, but also because of financial hardships within their own organisations. \\"As Africa's economies have collapsed, many African churches have been reduced to a state of penury.\\"Brouwer, Gifford & Rose 1996: 168-155 Indeed, Zambia itself became increasingly reliant on outside AID. Though Christian nation status ensured that Christians in the west would be encouraged to donate more to see Zambia succeed, Zambia's poverty and debt burden increased dramatically during the 1990s. Chiluba's policies were causing the churches to distance themselves from him. \\"In March 1992 [the] EFZ… issued a statement in which it appealed to the Zambian church to 'restrict itself to those matters that are within its competence' and to 'maintain a reasonable distance form government'.\\"Phiri 1999: 344-45 By 1996 the term Christian nation had been written into the opening of the proposed Zambian constitution. This took the debate from whether the declaration in 1991 was a personal statement or policy to a new level. As Phiri says it now, \\"had legal implications or a longer lasting nature than the Chiluba presidency.\\"2003: 410 There were demands from opposition MPs and even a joint communiqué from the ECZ, CCZ and even the EFZ calling for a referendum, but, \\"Chiluba simply offered the constitution to Parliament to approve\\",Phiri 2003: 411 and his confidence was rewarded when the MMD MPs holding a vast majority approved the wording. These actions along with others by Chiluba, including attempting to prevent Kaunda from running for president again, caused UNIP to boycott the forthcoming presidential elections. Chiluba's perceived arrogance coupled with his failures to tackle the economic decline, poverty or corruption caused some pastors to conclude that what was lacking was suitably informed and educated Christians in politics to see the vision of a Christian nation through to its conclusion. Nevers Mumba, a Pentecostal pastor, and a key supporter of Chiluba in 1991 formed the National Christian's CoalitionNCC in 1996. Mumba claimed that this was not a political party, but just an organisation to \\"act as an independent voice in guiding the president in matters of concern to the church\\".Phiri 2003: 413 However this caused great controversy among Christians, some of whom thought Mumba was in fact harbouring political ambitions to become president himself. Mumba challenged the integrity of Chiluba's government and in doing so caused Chiluba to see the NCC as a threat to his power. Under increasing pressure from within the NCC and increasing alienation by other political groups and churches Mumba converted the NCC into a political party and stood at the 1996 elections. The NCC however failed to win a seat. Chiluba was returned by 70% of the vote, but only 40% of the registered electorate turned out and only 60% of eligible electors had ever been registered. The absence of UNIP and voting irregularities caused many, including international observers, to question the validity of the election. In his second term Chiluba continued to lose the confidence of the people of Zambia. In 1997 an attempted coup triggered the arrest of UNIP activists and the house arrest of Kenneth Kaunda. This brought down international condemnation on Chiluba. His separation from his wife Vera in 2000 caused many in church circles to question whether Chiluba's faith was what it once had been. And when Chiluba's demanded to stay on for a third term, despite the fact that it contradicted the constitution he had fought so hard to push through, it diminished his standing even further. In 1991, \\"Chiluba… promised the Christian community that power… [would] not corrupt his character\\", but this had an increasingly hollow ring to it. Gifford comments the make up of the MMD included a large number of Kaunda's regime who had jumped ship to keep their lucrative positions.1999:205-6 \\"In 1994, Vice- President Levy Mwanamasa resigned, alleging Chiluba's government was corrupt.\\"Gifford 1999: 206 When opposed over his demand for a third term, \\"Chiluba reacted undemocratically by expelling twenty-two senior members of the MMD party, including Miyanda.\\"Phiri 2003: 422 On 3 May 2001 an attempt to impeach Chiluba was made to the Zambian parliament and backed by 158 MPs. The next day Chiluba, \\"announced 'I will leave office at the end of my term. Let's take national interests into consideration, this is in the best interest of the nation'… his presidency of Zambia as a Christian Nation ended with his reputation both as a Christian and as a democrat in ruins.\\"Phiri 2003: 423 He handed over power to the newly elected president Levy Mwanamasa, the leader of the MMD, in December 2001. In his first address to the Nation, the new president reaffirmed his commitment to the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation. Pentecostal churches have managed to distance themselves to such a degree they were largely unaffected by Chiluba's fall. The instigation of the NCC by Mumba provided many with a safe method of switching allegiances without abandoning the concept of the Christian nation. Phiri says of Zambian political affairs that it, \\"has not fallen into the pattern of one party that supports the Christian Nation, contesting with another party which opposes it. Zambian politics has come increasingly to be played out between supporters of the Christian Nation.\\"2003: 401 Following Mwanamasa's election he called on Nevers Mumba to become Vice President and in doing so conferred Pentecostal legitimacy on his government without the baggage that surrounded Chiluba. In many ways the Chiluba presidency has enabled the Pentecostal church to secure its voice in with the larger and more established churches in Zambia and among the urban populations in particular it is increasingly seen as one of the most active parts of civil society.

Tones of Twice, are a Scottish hip hop group composed of Mistah Bohze, Defy, Sace and DJ Krash Slaughta. They emerged from the Glasgow Hip Hop scene of the late 80s. History The Group hailing from Glasgow's southside were purveyors of the early British hip hop sound, labeled by some as Britcore. Along with other britcore groups such as Gunshot, Hijack, London Posse, Demon Boyz, Katch 22, Silver Bullet, Hardnoise and Killa Instinct, the groups manage to create a sound and identity which gave rise to the UK hip hop scene, something the UK had struggled with ever since hip hop first arrived. Although acclaimed by critics and fellow artists, and despite selling over 30,000 copies of their EP and compilation releases, the Glasgow band were better known in mainland Europe than they were at home in the UK. In recently years Mistah Bohze, alongside fellow Woodchoppas Dojo artists Chuck and NC Epik, has produced two albums with his new group The Sentinalez.

It can include hereditary hearing loss or hearing loss due to other factors present either in-utero (prenatal) or at the time of birth.  Genetic factors  Genetic factors are thought to cause more than 50% of all incidents of congenital hearing loss. Genetic hearing loss may be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked (related to the sex chromosome).  Hearing loss  = Autosomal dominant hearing loss = In autosomal dominant hearing loss, one parent who carries the dominant gene for hearing loss and typically has a hearing loss passes it on to the child. In this case there is at least a 50% probability that the child will also have a hearing loss. The probability is higher if both parents have the dominant gene (and typically both have a hearing loss) or if both grandparents on one side of the family have hearing loss due to genetic causes. Because at least one parent usually has a hearing loss, there is prior expectation that the child may have a hearing loss. Autosomal dominant congenital hearing loss can be attributed to such causes like Waardenburg Syndrome. = Autosomal recessive hearing loss = In autosomal recessive hearing loss, both parents who typically have normal hearing, carry a recessive gene. In this case the probability of the child having a hearing loss is 25%. Because both parents usually have normal hearing, and because no other family members have hearing loss, there is no prior expectation that the child may have a hearing loss. = X-linked hearing loss = In X-linked hearing loss, the mother carries the recessive trait for hearing loss on the sex chromosome. She can pass on the trait to males and female children, but usually only male children are affected. There are some genetic syndromes, in which hearing loss is one of the known characteristics. Some examples are Down syndrome (abnormality on a gene), Usher syndrome (autosomal recessive), Treacher Collins syndrome (autosomal dominant), Crouzon syndrome (autosomal dominant), and Alport syndrome (X-linked). = Other causes of congenital hearing loss = Other causes of congenital hearing loss that are not hereditary in nature include prenatal infections, illnesses, toxins consumed by the mother during pregnancy or other conditions occurring at the time of birth or shortly thereafter. These conditions typically cause sensorineural hearing loss ranging from mild to profound in degree.  Interventions  A child with a congenital hearing loss should begin receiving intervention before 6 months of age. Studies suggest that children who receive early interventions are better able to develop communication skills (using spoken or sign language). Once a child is diagnosed, doctors or the audiologists can counsel the family and provide options for intervention. In the United States of America, because of a Federal law (the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), children with a hearing loss between birth and 3 years of age have the right to receive interdisciplinary assessment and early intervention services at little or no cost. After age 3, early intervention and special education programs are provided through the public school system. Surgery may be recommended if a child has a permanent conductive hearing loss caused by malformations of the outer or middle ear, or by repeated ear infections. Although fluid in the middle ear usually results in only temporary hearing loss, chronic ear infection can cause a child to fall behind in language skills. In some cases, a doctor may suggest inserting a tube through the eardrum to allow the middle ear to drain. This procedure generally does not require an overnight hospital stay. There are a number of intervention options available for hearing loss, and parents will need to decide which are most appropriate for their child. They will need to consider the child’s age, developmental level and personality, the severity of the hearing loss, as well as their own preferences. Ideally a team of experts including the child’s primary care provider, an otolaryngologist, a speech-language pathologist, audiologist and an educator will work closely with the parents to create an Individualized Family Service Plan. Treatment plans can be changed as the child gets older. Children as young as 4 weeks of age can benefit from a hearing aid. These devices amplify sound, making it possible for many children to hear spoken words and develop spoken language. However, some children with severe to profound hearing loss may not be able to hear enough sound, even with a hearing aid, to make speech audible. A behind-the-ear hearing aid is often recommended for young children because it is safer and more easily fitted and adjusted as the child grows as compared to one that fits within the ear. Today a variety of good quality hearing aids are available – analog or digital body worn (for small children) or ear level for older children. When fitting a hearing aid, a competent audiologist has to assess the child's residual hearing, look at the hearing aid's performance and fit the child with an appropriate instrument. Equally important is the ear mold, which has to be custom made to suit the shape of the child's ear. If a child has profound deafness, the benefits of hearing aids are limited. Cochlear implants may be used instead of hearing aids. They can be surgically inserted in the inner ear of children as young as 12 months of age to stimulate hearing. The surgery requires a hospital stay of one to several days. With additional language and speech therapy, children with cochlear implants may learn to understand speech and speak reasonably well, but the amount of improvement is variable. Assistive devices can be used alone or paired with a hearing aid or cochlear implant to aid listening in difficult or noisy environments. In the United States of America, the type preferred by most deaf adults is American Sign Language (ASL), which has rules and grammar that is distinct from English. There are also several variations of sign language that can be used along with spoken English which are standard in English-speaking countries outside the United States. There is also a visual model of spoken language called cued speech. Learning to lip read is very difficult because many sounds look the same on the lips. Cued speech enables young children with hearing loss to clearly see what is being said, and learn spoken languages with normal grammar and vocabulary. It clarifies lip reading using 8 hand shapes in 4 positions and usually takes less than 20 hours to learn the entire system.

It is known from a handful of localities in southeast Papua, New Guinea (O. meridionalis meridionalis) and several localities along the south coast of Irian Jaya (O. meridionalis tarunggarensis). The specific ephiphet meridionalis, means southern. History O. meridionalis was first collected by Albert Stewart Meek near Samarai, Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea. The holotype is a female held in the British Museum (Natural History) collection. Meek was funded in his expeditions by the scientific author of this species, Lord Walter Rothschild. Distribution and habitat It is strictly a lowland species, favouring primary rainforest. A very few specimens have also been collected at altitude in Irian Jaya by Jan Pasternak, however these specimens were reared from immature stages and emerged crippled (Deslisle, 2004), suggesting that high altitude forests are not favoured habitats. O. meridionalis has also recently been found in close promimity to its sister species, Ornithoptera paradisea, near Timika in Irian Jaya (Gotts, 2003). Host plants for this species are all vines of the genus Pararistolochia (Aristolochiaceae), including the species P. meridionalis in Papua New Guinea. Larvae typically ringbark the host before pupating on nearby plants. O. meridionalis is classified as Near Threatened in Threatened Swallowtail Butterflies of the World: The IUCN Red Data Book and is threatened by habitat loss (rainforest clearing), especially in parts of Papua New Guinea. For example, a well known locality at the Brown River has now been destroyed by logging. There are a few villages farming this species in Papua New Guinea. Most commercially available specimens are now sourced from Irian Jaya and are extremely valuable (prices may exceed US$1000 per pair). Collecting has a negligible effect on population sizes provided the original habitat is left undisturbed. Description Males of O. meridionalis are remarkable in that they have an extremely small amount of wing area relative to its rather bulky body. In particular, the hindwings are very reduced and tetragonal in shape, tapering into a single pair of filamentous tails that are easily broken. The only other tailed Ornithoptera is Ornithoptera paradisea. Specimens of this sex are weak fliers and tend to spend most of the day resting. Females are more normally proportioned and have a flight characteristic more typical of the genus Ornithoptera. Both sexes have been recorded feeding at flowers in numbers early in the morning.

Over his nearly sixty-year career, he exposed UFO hoaxes and engineered hoaxes of his own. He was best known as the publisher of the UFO newsletters Saucer News and its successor Saucer Smear, which became the longest continuously published UFO journal in the world. Many in the UFO community considered Moseley to be a skeptic, as Moseley reported that over the years he accepted, then rejected, a number of explanations for UFOs. According to Jerome Clark, he \\"entertained just about every view it is possible to hold about UFOs,\\" and according to Antonio Huneeus, \\"Moseley was critical and sarcastic regarding just about everything and everybody in UFOlogy. Yet Jim did believe a core of the UFO phenomenon was real and truly unexplained after filtering out all the hoaxes, conspiracy theories, mis- identifications and just plain nonsense that pervades much of the field.\\" Biography =Early life= James Moseley was the son of U.S. Army Major General George Van Horn Moseley, chief of the 4th Section (supplies and evacuation) of General Pershing's Wartime General Staff, and Florence Barber Moseley (née DuBois) whose family owned the Barber Steamship Lines. His parents were married in July 1930, at which time his father was already 55 years old, and James was born the following year. His childhood was spent on army bases until his father's retirement in 1938. James never got along with his father, taking particular exception to his outspoken racist and anti- semitic views, including his claims that America must \\"breed up\\" its own decaying population by copying Nazi eugenics practices, and launch a program of \\"selective breeding, sterilization, the elimination of the unfit, and the elimination of those types which are inimical to the general welfare of the nation.\\" =1950s= His mother died in December 1950, leaving the nineteen- year-old James the beneficiary of a large trust fund. Moseley inherited sufficient money to be able to pursue his own interests, and he never worked a conventional career. He left Princeton University, and spent much of his time initially traveling to South America to engage in what he called \\"grave robbing\\" of pre-Columbian artifacts, then later travelling to UFO conferences, interviewing UFO witnesses and personalities. Moseley took up amateur archaeology and he made many trips to Peru, and to a lesser extent Ecuador and northern Chile, purchasing and digging up pre-Columbian antiquities. The distinction between archaeology and treasure hunting or grave-robbing was not always clear, and some of his activities may not be approved today. Even so, he made some significant finds and several of the mummies he found were placed in Peruvian museums by professional archaeologists. After Nazca Lines were first discovered by the Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejia Xesspe in 1927, Moseley was the first to suggest that there were intriguing Fortean phenomena in Fate Magazine, in October 1955, suggesting a mysterious origin, long before they interested alternative writers such as Erich von Däniken (1968), Henri Stierlin (1983) and Gerald Hawkins (1990). These South American trips indirectly led to his flying saucer involvement, when he agreed to collaborate on a book with Ken Krippene. His interest in UFOs grew out of the incidents involving pilots Kenneth Arnold in 1947 and Thomas Mantell in 1948. His flying saucer career really began in 1953 when he drove across the country \\"tracking the elusive flying saucer\\" in preparation for his planned book. He interviewed almost 100 UFO experts and eyewitnesses: he visited the Pentagon and examined their files on UFO investigations; he visited the Project Blue Book facilities at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, meeting Col. Bob Friend; he interviewed the famous saucer author Major Donald E. Keyhoe, and felt that \\"Keyhoe routinely made too much out of too little, at least in part just to sell books\\"; he went to Mt. Palomar, California, where \\"Professor [George] Adamski was holding court\\" in his hamburger stand; he met Gray Barker, who was to become his long-time friend and collaborator; he interviewed best-selling author Frank Scully; he attended the \\"Giant Rock\\" contactee convention and interviewed many witnesses, researchers and officials. He even met former President Harry S. Truman at his office in Independence, Missouri, and asked him about flying saucers. In what became one of Moseley's favorite anecdotes, Truman responded jokingly, \\"I’ve never seen a purple cow, I never hope to see one.\\" When he returned from this trip, Moseley founded the organization S.A.U.C.E.R.S. (Saucers And Unexplained Celestial Events Research Society). The book with Ken Krippene never eventuated, but Moseley's interest in UFOs deepened during his research and he also came to a realization. \\"I had discovered I wasn’t cut out to be a serious UFOlogist, unless of course one was to count the work I did exposing Adamski and, as time went on, certain other fakers and frauds.\\" In July, 1954, Moseley co-founded Saucer News (originally titled Nexus), a periodical known for its unorthodox, \\"freewheeling\\" style. Beyond the fake feuds (particularly with Gray Barker) and occasional hoaxes, Saucer News also featured serious research and reporting about UFOs, drawing heavily on the material he had gathered during his 1953 cross-country trip. Moseley was among the first to publicize evidence against George Adamski's claims of alien contact in number of issues, culminating in a special exposé issue of Saucer News, and he reported his investigation into the Ralph Horton flying saucer crash, which he also conducted during the 1953 trip. =1960s= Through the 1960s, Moseley became increasingly active among the UFO community, and his public profile grew. He gave many lectures about flying saucers, and even made several trips to Giant Rock in the California desert, a sort of Woodstock for UFO contactees and their followers. He was a semi-regular guest of Long John Nebel's radio show which dealt mainly with anomalous phenomena, UFOs, and other offbeat topics. After that, he moved on to become a regular guest of James Randi on The Amazing Randi Show, also on New York City radio station WOR. In later years, Moseley fell out with both men, referring to them as his enemies. In 1966, there was a new wave of UFO publicity, kicked off by the incident in Michigan where Allen Hynek offered his \\"swamp gas\\" explanation which became famous. Moseley's lecturing took off after this: the story was hot... \\"back in New York City, all the major national news organizations were rushing around trying to find an instant saucer expert to interview and quote. Mine was the only listing in the Manhattan phone book under \\"Saucers\\" (for Saucer News), so everyone came to me.\\" To give his readers a sense of this activity, Moseley published his appearance schedule in Saucer News: during the month of April 1967, for example, he delivered nine formal lectures at universities and colleges, and he gave another six media interviews. Around this time was also when he and Barker made the hoax Lost Creek saucer video. Moseley attended the first large-scale gathering of the Congress of Scientific UFOlogists in Cleveland, Ohio in June of 1964, and he publicized it in his Saucer News. After two more successful gatherings in Cleveland, Moseley decided to hold a really big convention in New York City in 1967. He arranged a wide range of well-known speakers, including Joe Franklin of WOR -TV, Gordon Evans, Art Ford, Frank Stranges, John Keel, Stewart Robb, Gray Barker, James Randi, Long John Nebel, Howard Menger, Ivan Sanderson, and Roy Thinnes, the star of the hit ABC-TV science fiction thriller The Invaders. He secured the Grand Ballroom as well as the East Ballroom of the huge Hotel Commodore, right in the heart of Manhattan. Many UFO publications publicized the event, particularly since 1967 was the 20th anniversary of the Kenneth Arnold sighting. This \\"NYC Saucer Con\\" was a great success, with total attendance variously estimated from \\"well over a thousand\\" to six thousand people. In 1971, Moseley became Permanent Chairman of the National UFO Conference (NUFOC), whose main purpose was to organize and run an annual meeting or convention. Moseley and Philip Klass at the 1983 CSICOP Conference in Buffalo, NY =1970s= Moseley ready to be \\"levitated\\" at the National UFO Conference in Hollywood, California in 2004 Moseley sold Saucer News to his long-time friend Gray Barker in 1968. In 1970, he founded another newsletter that went by several titles until Moseley finally settled on Saucer Smear. He produced the newsletter irregularly, but tried to keep a monthly schedule in later years. It became the longest continuously published UFO journal in the world. Moseley never went online; he never owned a computer. He produced the print version of \\"Saucer Smear\\" on a regular portable electric typewriter. The publication was sent via mail to \\"non-subscribers,\\" and he also authorized others to sell PDF issues and subscriptions from a website. It typically had a joking, gossipy tone and it covered not just UFO cases, but also examined the personalities of UFOlogists and it did not hesitate to poke fun at people if he thought they deserved it. When UFOlogists were feuding, as they often were, Moseley loved to run the vitriolic letters one would send in denouncing the other. The masthead on each issue proclaimed Moseley as the \\"Supreme Commander\\". =1980s and later= In 1984, Moseley established an antiques store in Key West, Florida. There was a pre-Columbian art gallery, largely stocked with material he still had from his trips to South America in the 1950s. In 1992, Moseley donated his Peruvian collection to the Graves Museum of Archaeology and Natural History in Dania, Florida, where it is on permanent display. Moseley co-wrote a memoir with Karl T. Pflock in 2002, entitled Shockingly Close to the Truth! Confessions of a Grave-Robbing Ufologist, in which he recounted “the fun he has had over the years pursuing tall tales and purported evidence of visitors from outer space.” James Moseley died from cancer of the esophagus on November 16, 2012 at a hospital in Key West, Florida; he was 81 years old. UFO investigations and hoaxes =Exposé of George Adamski= George Adamski was a teacher of the occult, who wrote a book in 1953 entitled Flying Saucers Have Landed, which told the story of his encounter with an extraterrestrial named Orthon. The book made him a celebrity in flying saucer circles, and it inspired other people who became known as \\"contactees\\" to make similar claims. Adamski started to produce an abundance of apparent \\"evidence\\": multiple witnesses, physical traces, photographs and later he took movies of the saucer while he claimed to have ongoing contact with the visitors from space and share their message of peace and love with the people of Earth. Moseley had interviewed Adamski in 1953, and while he found the “Professor” interesting and charismatic, he did not find the evidence convincing. He published several articles critically examining Adamski's stories and photographs in issues of Saucer News magazine, and in October 1957 he published a \\"Special Adamski Exposé Issue\\" that collected articles written by Moseley, Irma Baker and Lonzo Dove to present a thorough analysis. The front cover showed how a \\"saucer photo\\" just like Adamski's could be made using a Chrysler hubcap, a coffee can, and ping pong balls. Jerrold Baker told how Adamski had provided him with fraudulent photos and suggested that \\"people would pay good money\\" if Baker claimed the photos were his own. The exposé included interviews and correspondence with Adamski's supporting witnesses, some of whom said they had been mis-quoted, and others who turned out to be long-time associates of Adamski and who admitted that Adamski's story and photographs had been falsified. This was a watershed in the UFO field; it marked the first really serious analytical investigation into the evidence supporting a major claim. More than forty years later, the UFO historian Jerome Clark said \\"...the first serious investigation by a critic of Adamski’s claims was conducted by James W. Moseley in the mid-1950s and published as a special issue of his magazine Saucer News ... Moseley’s debunking of Adamski’s claims remains the definitive one\\". =Straith hoax letter= Moseley was long suspected of having co-created a phony 1957 letter as a prank against self-claimed \\"alien contactee\\", George Adamski. After years of denying his involvement, evading the subject, and hinting at responsibility, Moseley admitted to the hoax in 1985. Adamski had become well known following publication of his 1953 book Flying Saucers Have Landed, and subsequent paraphernalia \\"evidence\\". Moseley published a damning exposé in Saucer News magazine. Just as word of Adamski's fakery was spreading, a letter of support came from an unlikely source. In 1957, Gray Barker acquired some blank U.S. Governmental official letterhead and envelopes from a friendwhite- seal, blue-embossed paper, with the American eagle watermark and the Seal of State impressed. During an evening \\"emboldened by the evil of alcohol\\", Moseley and Barker wrote seven prank letters using this official stationery. Five of the letters were jokes to friends, and two were outright hoaxes: the Adamski letter and one to Moseley's own father, which was never mailed, that \\"objected to his having indulged in extreme right-wing political activities while on a military pension, strongly implying he might lose the latter if he did not refrain from the former”. The letter to Adamski was signed by the fictional \\"R.E. Straith\\", a representative of the non-existent \\"Cultural Exchange Committee\\" of the U.S. State Department. Straith wrote that the government knew that Adamski had actually spoken to extraterrestrials in a California desert in 1952, and that the department also had its own evidence bearing out his claims. It encouraged him to continue his work of communicating his experiences to the public, since the government could not take an official position on the matter. Adamski took great pride in the Straith letter. He publicized its contents, and UFO proponents all over the world used it to validate their claims. When FBI agents investigated it, they informed Adamski that the Straith letter was a hoax and asked him to stop using it as evidence in support of his claims, but Adamski refused and he continued to display the letter in his lectures and talks. FBI agents also questioned Barker about the matter, but no criminal charges were filed. Many investigators tried to confirm or debunk the letter, without any categorical outcomes. Barker himself described it as \\"one of the great unsolved mysteries of the UFO field\\" in his 1967 Book of Adamski. Danny Forinash. \\"55 good things about West Virginia: Men in Black a state native's handiwork\\". State Journal. May 27, 2005. GT10. As late as 1983, researchers Timothy Good and Lou Zinsstag concluded that \\"much of the evidence is circumstantial, but on balance there is more in favour of the letter being genuine.\\" On December 6, 1984, Gray Barker died. The next month, Jim Moseley revealed the truth in Saucer Smear on January 10, 1985. Moseley has admitted to multiple UFO \\"hoaxes\\", and is suspected in many more, but the Straith hoax appears to be the one most remembered by both his fans and his detractors. =Ralph Horton crash case= Horton and the \\"flying saucer\\" Moseley investigated the Ralph Horton flying saucer crash after finding it in the flying saucer file of the Atlanta Constitution. Moseley called the airport and confirmed that the object was a device used by the Air Force to determine wind velocity and direction. It was sent up attached to a balloon and tracked by radar, since radar beams were reflected by the object. Horton retrieved the object from where he had discarded it, and gave it to Moseley, but Moseley subsequently lost it. In later years, Moseley lamented that if he had held on to the object, then it might have been he instead of Pflock who cracked the Roswell UFO Incident. =Lost Creek saucer video= The Lost Creek Saucer sighting was a hoax brainstormed by Gray Barker and James Moseley in early 1966. The idea was to produce footage of a flying saucer. On July 26, 1966, in Lost Creek, West Virginia they had John Sheets — one of Barker's researchers — hold a ceramic \\"boogie\\" saucer on a fishing pole in front of a car, while Moseley drove and Barker filmed. Afterwards, Moseley played the film during his UFO lectures, and Barker sold copies of the footage via his mail-order film business. Both men continued to claim that Sheets had innocently recorded the saucer landing. In \\"Whispers from Space,\\" the footage is shown while Moseley discusses its origins. Moseley later wrote in his book \\"In addition to showing the film on New York–area television and at one of the Saucer News monthly lectures, I incorporated it and the story behind it into my American Program Bureau talk. I had decided I needed a 'prop' for my lectures\\", then describes how he, Barker and Sheets made it. References Further reading * * James W.

The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Preity Zinta, Arjun Rampal, Divya Dutta, Shefali Shah and Jisshu Sengupta. Shefali Shah won the Best Supporting Actress National Award for her role in the movie. It was produced by Arindam Chaudhuri of Planman Motion Pictures. Production Basing the script on Utpal Dutt's semiautobiographical play Aajker Shahjahan, Rituparno Ghosh penned it in 2006, and turned to the actors in February 2007, all of whom accepted the offer. The film began shooting from 28 February 2007 to 10 April 2007; principal shooting took place in Kolkata and some shooting took place in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand. Dubbing for the film ended on 31 August 2007. The Last Lear premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September and received a significant reception, earning many accolades after being showcased at a Gala Presentation. The film was later showcased at the London Film Festival, and the International Film Festival of India in Goa. The film was received positively by critics with many saying that Bachchan has given a career best performance. Plot The story revolves around Harish Mishra (Amitabh Bachchan), a retired Shakespearean theatre actor who spent precisely thirty years and nine months on stage and then suddenly quit, and his first and last act as a cinema artist. He is immensely passionate about Shakespeare, believes that nothing even comparable can ever be written, knows all his plays by heart, lives in those stories, condemns modern cinema and considers theatre as a much higher artform for directors and actors to convey their message to an audience. It is Diwali, a time when box offices are flooded with new releases and Shabnam (Preity Zinta) has to attend the premiere of her latest movie: The Mask. However, she decides to visit her co-star Harish and heads to a cubbyhole of old Kolkata where Harish is bedridden in a coma. He is being taken care by Vandana (Shefali Shah) and a nurse, Ivy (Divya Dutta). Vandana treats Shabnam with spite as she blames her and the entire cast and crew for Harish's condition. But soon they are seen bonding over tea and are involved in a conversation about Harish. In flashbacks, their story and equation with Harish emerges. The movie sees parallel narration from Goutam (Jisshu Sengupta), a journalist who recalls his encounters with the veteran actor. He had suggested Harish for the lead role to his elder brother Siddharth (Arjun Rampal) who happens to be an ambitious perfectionist director. After a casual meeting with Harish, Siddharth realizes that to convince Harish to act in his film, he has to win his trust and establish a relationship with him. And, hence, the impatient young auteur attempts to win the trust and collaboration of the aged performer, who sits raging against the modern world from the sanctuary of his study. Harish finally agrees to act in the film. Shooting happens on the stunning Himalayan foothills of Mussoorie. On the sets he befriends Shabnam and teaches her lessons on acting, life and Shakespeare. As the story unfolds one gets to know his relationship with Vandana, the reason behind his quitting theatre and last but not the least the reason for his illness. The Last Lear becomes a captivating reflection on the comparative artifices of stagecraft and cinema.

Early life, education and military service Morrison was born in Evanston, Illinois. He attended the public schools there and started acting in the pioneering children’s theater headed by Winifred Ward. By age 13 he was playing Tom Sawyer in an elaborate production with the adult roles being played by Northwestern University students. On graduation from high school he spent three summers in a Pennsylvania on-week stock company directed by the legendary Alvina Krause, where he played parts ranging from Ernest in The Importance of Being Earnest to Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. He served two years in the United States Army, and graduated with a Ph.B. from the University of Chicago. It was here that he began a lifelong friendship with Mike Nichols and Paul Sills. He also attended the Yale Drama School as a director and came to New York City in 1953 where he studied in Lee Strasberg's private class and then for a number of years at the Actors Studio. Teaching Morrison created the George Morrison Studio, where he offered acting classes for over 20 years; his students included Gene Hackman and Barbara Harris. (Hackman would later thank Morrison during his acceptance speech for the Best Actor award for his role in The French Connection at the 1972 Academy Awards.) In 1972, Morrison became one of the founding faculty of a new Actor Training Program along with Norris Houghton and Joseph Anthony at the State University of New York at Purchase, where he taught for 18 years and was awarded the Chancellor’s Citation for Outstanding Teaching and is now Professor Emeritus of Theater Arts. His students at Purchase included Edie Falco, Ving Rhames and Stanley Tucci. He retired in 1988 to found, with Paul Sills and Mike Nichols, his classmates from the University of Chicago, a two- year independent conservatory for professional actor training, The New Actors Workshop, in New York City where he served as the president and primary instructor of acting. Directing Morrison's first New York production was Epitaph for George Dillon by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton, which he co- produced and directed. He went on to direct improvisation-based revues off Broadway at The Premise with a company that included Hackman, George Furth, Cynthia Harris and Ron Leibman, and at Upstairs at the Downstairs - a cabaret revue that included Mary Louise Wilson and Jane Alexander. For The American Place Theater, he directed Harry, Noon and Night by Ronald Ribman, with Dustin Hoffman and Joel Grey and in Chicago a long-running production of Pinter’s The Caretaker. On Broadway, he directed Jack Klugman in The Sudden & Accidental Re-Education of Horse Johnson by Douglas Taylor, and for ABC-TV two musical revue scripts by Betty Comden and Adolph Green.

He is one of two John Bevans who played for Wales during the 1970s. Rugby career His début for Wales came on 16 January 1971 during the Five Nations Championship when Wales played England. He crowned the win with a try as Wales ran out 22-6 winners. He played in all of the other games in the tournament, but did not score again, as Wales went on to win the championship and the Grand Slam. Starting his career in rugby union, he played for the Cardiff club and after being capped for Wales in 1971, Bevan toured Australia and New Zealand with the British Lions. He played in 14 matches including the first test and scored a total of 18 tries. The 17 scored in New Zealand equalled the record of Tony O'Reilly. He was a speedy wing (number 11) from Tylorstown South Wales and is chiefly remembered for his role in the Barbarians' victory over New Zealand in 1973, during which he scored a try. During his short international career Bevan scored 5 tries for Wales. In September 1973, Bevan switched to rugby league, and joined Warrington for the then massive signing on fee of £12,000 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £199,700 in 2015). He made 332 appearances for the Warrington club in which he scored 201 tries usually on the . He played for Wales and Great Britain.

Personal history He has taught at many schools including: Ferndale Boys School, Culcheth High School, English Martyrs School and Arnold School in Blackpool. In September 2000, after having stepped down as Director of Coaching for the Welsh Rugby Union, John Bevan joined the teaching staff at Monmouth School as a teacher of Religious Education and Director of Rugby Coaching. He currently coaches teams throughout the school, including the 1st XV who are unbeaten since he has been there. His catchphrase of \\"my granny could do better than that\\" meaning anything from tackle, to run, is perhaps the main reason for Monmouth's record of 123 games unbeaten.

The war was caused by a large fine imposed in 357 BC on the Phocians by the Amphictyonic League (dominated at that moment by Thebes), for the offense of cultivating sacred land; refusing to pay, the Phocians instead seized the Temple of Apollo in Delphi, and used the accumulated treasures to fund large mercenary armies. Thus, although the Phocians suffered several major defeats, they were able to continue the war for many years, until eventually all parties were nearing exhaustion. Philip II used the distraction of the other states to increase his power in northern Greece, in the process becoming ruler of Thessaly. In the end, Philip's growing power, and the exhaustion of the other states, allowed him to impose a peaceful settlement of the war, marking a major step in the rise of Macedon to pre-eminence in Ancient Greece. Sources and Chronology The ancient sources for the Third Sacred War are scant, and generally lacking in firm chronological information.Buckler, p. xiv.Buckler, p. 148. The main source for the period is Diodorus Siculus's Bibliotheca historica, written in the 1st century BC, which is therefore very much a secondary source.Green, Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age. p. xxiv. Diodorus is often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else.Green, Greek History 480-431 BC, pp. 1-13.Cawkwell, p. 31. Diodorus worked primarily by epitomizing the works of other historians, omitting many details where they did not suit his purpose, which was to illustrate moral lessons from history; his account of the Third Sacred War therefore contains many gaps. Beyond Diodorus, further details of the Sacred War can be found in the orations of Athenian statesmen, primarily Demosthenes and Aeschines, which have survived intact. Since these speeches were never intended to be historical material, they must be treated with circumspection; Demosthenes and Aeschines have been described as \\"a couple of liars, neither of whom can be trusted to have told the truth in any matter in which it was remotely in his interest to lie\\".Cawkwell, p. 92. Nevertheless, their allusions in speeches to contemporary or past events indicate some of the gaps in Diodorus's account, and help with the arrangement of a chronology. The accounts of Diodorus, Demosthenes and Aeschines can be further supplemented by fragments of otherwise lost histories (such as that by Theopompus) and by contemporary epigraphic sources. Modern historians' dates for the war have been hotly debated, with no clear consensus.Buckler, pp. 148-195. It is generally accepted that the war lasted 10 years, and ended in summer 346 BC (one of the few firm dates), which yields a date of 356 BC for the beginning of the war, with Philomelos's seizure of Delphi. Diodorus's chronology for the sacred war is very confused—he dates the start and end of the war a year too late, variously says the war lasted 9, 10 or 11 years, and included the siege of Methone twice under different dates—and his dates cannot therefore be relied upon. After Philomelos's defeat at Neon, the Thebans thought it safe to send the general Pammenes to Asia with 5000 hoplites; Pammenes probably met with Philip at Maroneia in 355 BC, presumably on his outward journey. Buckler, the only historian to produce a systematic study of the sacred war, therefore places Neon in 355 BC, and suggests after the meeting with Pammenes, Philip went to begin the siege of Methone. Other historians have placed Neon in 354 BC, because Diodorus says that the battle took place while Philip besieged Methone which Diodorus (at one point) places in 354 BC. Disregarding the dates, most historians agree upon the same sequence of events for the first phases of the Sacred War. The principal question is therefore when that sequence started. Thus, Buckler (as well as Beloch and Cloche) dates Neon to 355 BC, Methone to 355-354 BC, Philip's first Thessalian campaign to 354 BC, and his second to 353 BC. Conversely, Cawkwell, Sealey, Hammond and others lower all these dates by one year, beginning with Neon in 354 BC.Cawkwell, p. 185. Background The war was ostensibly caused by the refusal of the Phocian Confederation to pay a fine imposed on them in 357 BC by the Amphictyonic League, a pan-Hellenic religious organisation which governed the most sacred site in Ancient Greece, the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.Buckler, p. 20-22 The fine was occasioned by the Phocians's illegal cultivation of sacred land on the Kirrhaean plain, which they did not deny; the fine was, however, far beyond the Phocians' ability to pay. Under normal circumstances, refusal to pay the fine would have made the Phocians religious (and therefore political) outcasts in Greece, and liable to have a sacred war declared against them.Buckler p. 16.Worthington, p. 53. Behind the religious element, there probably lay a display of realpolitik in bringing charges against the Phocians, instigated by the Thebans. The Phocians had declined to send troops on the Mantinea campaign of 362 BC, despite Theban requests, and this appears to have caused lasting enmity in Thebes.Cawkwell, p. 63. By 357 BC, with the Athenians embroiled in the Social War, and Alexander of Pherae (an erstwhile ally of the Phocians) dead, the Thebans deemed that the chance to punish Phocis had come. The Amphictyonic League was composed of 12 Greek tribes, primarily of central Greece (the Oetaeans, Boeotians, Dolopes, Phthian Achaeans, Locrians, Magnesians, Malians, Perrhaebians, Phocians, Pythians of Delphi and Thessalians), plus the Dorians (including Sparta) and the Ionians (including Athens), with each tribe having two votes in the council of the league.Aeschines II, 115 Thebes had effectively become the 'protector' of the league in 360 BC, after the civil war had restarted in Thessaly; the Thessalians having previously been the dominant power in the league.Buckler, p. 14. Thus, at this time, Thebes controlled a majority of the votes in the council, and at the autumn meeting in 357 BC, the Thebans were able to have both the Phocians (for the cultivation of the sacred land) and the Spartans (for occupying Thebes some 25 years previously) denounced and fined. Since the fines for both parties were \\"unjustifiably harsh\\", the Thebans probably expected neither party to pay, and thus to be able to declare a sacred war on either. There seems to have been some sympathy in Greece for the Phocians, since other states could see that \\"the Thebans...had used the Amphictyony to pursue petty and destructive vendettas\\".Buckler, p. 21. The Phocians held a special conference to decide what action to take. Philomelos, a citizen of Ledon, advocated a pre-emptive policy of seizing Delphi (which was situated within the boundaries of Phocis), and asserting the ancient claim of Phocis to the presidency of the Amphictyonic League.Cawkwell, p. 64. In this way, the Phocians could annul the judgment against themselves.Buckler, p. 22. The Phocians voted in favour of his proposal, and Philomelos was appointed strategos autokrator (general with independent powers) by the confederacy, with his chief supporter Onomarchos also elected as strategos. Philomelos travelled to Sparta to discuss his proposals with the Spartan king Archidamos III. Archidamos expressed his support, hoping that the Spartan fine would also be annulled, and gave Philomelos 15 talents to raise troops with.Buckler, p. 23. Seizure of Delphi On his return to Phocis, Philomelos began assembling a mercenary army using the 15 talents from Archidamos, and also raised a force of 1000 peltasts from amongst the Phocian citizenry. In approximately July 356 BC, Philomelos marched on Delphi, just before the end of the period in which the Phocians had been required to pay their fine. He easily captured the city of Delphi, along with the sanctuary of Apollo. Philomelos captured the nobles of the Thrakidai family, who had probably been involved in imposing the fine on Phocis, and killed them, seizing their wealth to add to his treasury. He promised the other Delphians that he would not harm them, although he had initially contemplated enslaving the whole city. =Ozolian Locrian expedition to Delphi= The news of Philomelos's move against Delphi resulted in a relief expedition being mounted by the Ozalian Locrians, probably mainly from Amphissa. Philomelos's army met the Locrians in open battle on a small plain between the city of Delphi and the sanctuary, and routed them with heavy losses. Some prisoners were taken, and Philomelos had them thrown from the cliffs that tower over the sanctuary (the Phaidriadai rocks). This was the traditional punishment for sacrilege against Apollo's temple, and through the means of this atrocity, Philomelos was asserting the Phocian claim to the presidency of the sanctuary. Buckler observes that \\"in his first acts, Philomelos set a brutal stamp on the war\\".Buckler, pp. 23-24. =Fortification of Delphi= After defeating the Locrians, Philomelos continued to strengthen his position in Delphi. He destroyed the stones which recorded the verdict against the Phocians, and abolished the government of the city, installing in its place a group of pro-Phocian Delphians, who had been in exile in Athens.Buckler, p. 25. Philomelos ordered the sanctuary be fortified on the western side (natural features defended the other approaches), and a large limestone wall was constructed. He then demanded that the priestess of Apollo (the Pythia) provide him with an oracle; she replied that he \\"could do whatever he wanted\\".Buckler, p. 26. Philomelos called that an oracle, and had it inscribed in the sanctuary, as was customary. This pseudo-oracle provided Philomelos with supposed divine justification from Apollo for his actions. He next sent embassies to all Greek states, asserting the Phocian claim to Delphi, and promising not to touch the treasury of Apollo; Buckler suggests that he did not expect the Greeks to acquiesce to his actions, but hoped to draw support away from the Amphictyons. The Spartans, as expected, endorsed Philomelos's actions, since their fine was now erased, whilst Athens also expressed support, following their general anti-Theban policies.Buckler, p. 27. =Declaration of Sacred War= However, Philomelos's embassies elsewhere met with failure. The Locrians demanded that the Amphictyons avenge them and Apollo, and the Thebans sent embassies to the other council members suggesting that a sacred war should be declared against Phocis.Buckler, pp. 27-28. This was assented to by most Greek states, including the Amphictyonic council members (minus Sparta and Athens), and those well-disposed to Thebes; furthermore, otherwise uninvolved states declared support for the Amphictyonic for reasons of piety. The Amphictyons seem to have decided that the year was too advanced to begin campaigning, and so agreed to launch military action the following year. They may have hoped that in the meantime, the Phocians' sacrilegious behaviour would cause them to reconsider their position.Buckler, p. 28. Start of the War (c. 355 BC) Following the declaration of war against Phocis, Philomelos decided he would need to substantially increase the size of his army. Rather than levy the Phocian citizen body, Philomelos decided to hire more mercenaries; the only way he could afford to do this was by plundering the dedications in the treasury of Apollo.Buckler, pp. 37-39. That the treasury contained much wealth, from years of accumulated donations, is well-established; it is estimated that the Phocians spent some 10,000 talents of Apollo's treasure during the war. In order to overcome the reluctance of mercenaries to fight for a sacrilegious cause, Philomelos increased the rate of pay by half, which allowed him to recruit a force of 10,000 troops over the winter, for the forthcoming war. =Conflict in Epicnemidian Locris and Phocis (c. 355 BC)= Phocian, Boeotian and Thessalian campaigns in 355 BC The following spring, possibly upon hearing news that the Boeotians were ready to march against Phocis, Philomelos took the initiative and marched into Epicnemidian Locris.Buckler, pp. 41-43. Since the Phocian army would be outnumbered by the whole Amphictyonic levy, it is probable that he sought to defeat his enemies one by one, starting with the Locrians. If he could defeat the Locrians, then he was in a position to occupy the narrow pass of Thermopylae and block the union of the Thessalian and Boeotian armies, the main Amphictyonic contingents. Philomelos's army thus crossed into Locris, probably using the Fontana pass from Triteis to Naryx, or possibly the Kleisoura pass from Tithronion to the same general area of Locris. The Locrians sent a force of cavalry to oppose him, which the Phocians easily defeated. However, this battle gave the Thessalians time to pass through Thermopylae and arrive in Locris. Philomelos immediately attacked the Thessalians, and defeated them near the town of Argolas, whose location is not definitively known. Buckler suggests, on the basis of topographical considerations, that the modern village of Mendenitsa must be ancient Argolas. Philomelos then laid siege to Argolas, but failed to capture it, and instead pillaged as much Locrian territory as possible. The Boeotian army, under the command of Pammenes, then arrived on the scene, and rather than oppose them, Philomelos backed off, allowing the Boeotians to link up with the Locrians and Thessalians. Philomelos had thus failed in his strategy of dealing with the Amphictyons separately, and he now faced an army at least equal in size to his own. He therefore decided to retreat before the Amphictyons could bring him to battle, and probably using the Kleisoura pass, he returned with his army to Phocis. Battle of Neon In response to Philomelos's retreat, Pammenes ordered the Amphictyonic force to cross into Phocis as well, probably by the Fontana pass, in order to prevent Philomelos marching on Boeotia.Buckler, pp. 44-45. The two armies converged on Tithorea (whose acropolis, Neon, gives the battle its name), where the Amphictyons brought the Phocians to battle. Details of the battle are scant, but the Amphictyons defeated the Phocians, and then pursued the survivors up the slopes of Mount Parnassos, slaying many. Philomelos was injured, and rather than risk capture, threw himself off the mountain, falling to his death. Onomarchos, who was second in command, managed to salvage the remainder of the army, and retreated to Delphi, whilst Pammenes retired to Thebes with the Boeotian army. Second phase (c. 354-353 BC) The Amphictyons seem to have concluded that their victory at Neon had effectively ended the war, and the Phocians would sue for peace.Buckler, p. 45. Otherwise, it is difficult to understand why Pammenes did not march on Delphi, or even sack the undefended Phocian cities in the Kephisos valley. In failing to follow up their victory, the Amphictyons wasted the best opportunity they had during the course of the war to end it. The Thebans seem to have been so sure that the war was ended that they agreed to send 5,000 hoplites under Pammenes to help the rebellion of the Persian satrap Artabazus, shortly after the Battle of Neon.Buckler, p. 50. The Thebans needed the money Artabazos offered them, and although they had generally been on good terms with the Persian king, they obviously felt the offer was too good to refuse. It is likely the troops were dispatched before the Phocian decision to fight on became clear, unless the Thebans thought that their remaining troops were a match for any army the Phocians could field.Buckler, p. 51. This was to prove a serious mistake for the Thebans, and the Amphictyonic cause in general. Rather than contemplate surrender after the retreat from Neon, Onomarchos had rallied the Phocians, and insisted that they should continue the war.Buckler, pp. 45-47. A meeting of the Phocian Confederation was held to discuss the future course of action, to which their Athenian and Spartan allies were invited. If they surrendered, the Phocians would face additional fines for their sacrilege, and for plundering the treasury; however, to fight on meant perpetrating still further sacrilege, and effectively committed the Phocians to winning a total victory against the Amphictyons. Whilst some were inclined towards peace, the majority were swayed by Onomarchos's orations and policies, quite possibly backed up by the threat of force from the mercenary army, and voted to continue the war. Buckler highlights the particular importance of the Phocian mercenary force on the decisions made by (or for) the Phocian Confederation during the course of the war, and also the peculiar consequences it had for the Phocians: \\"The primary loyalty of that army would go to its commander and paymaster, not to the Phocian Confederacy. In effect, continued war forced the Phocians to put their faith in the hands of a man who could act regardless of their wishes but the responsibility for whose acts would be theirs.\\" His position now secure, Onomarchos had his chief opponents arrested and executed, and confiscated their property to add to his war-chest. He then set about raising a new army, doubling the size of Philomelos's force, until he had 20,000 men and 500 cavalry at his disposal. Raising such a large force required extensive depredations of Apollo's wealth; bronze and iron dedications were melted down and recast as weapons, whilst gold and silver offerings were melted down and used to make coinage. Although raising such a large army would have taken a considerable time, Onomarchos had the whole winter after Neon in which to do so.Buckler, p. 47. =First Phocian campaign in Epicnemidian Locris (c. 354 BC)= First Phocian campaign in Epicnemidian Locris and Doris, 354 BC =Phocian campaign in Doris (c. 354 BC)= =First Phocian campaign in Boeotia (c. 354 BC)= First and second Phocian campaigns in Boeotia, 354-353 BC =First conflict in Thessaly (c. 354 BC)= The Sacred War appears to have laid way for renewed conflict within Thessaly. The Thessalian Confederation were in general staunch supporters of the Amphictyonic League, and had an ancient hatred of the Phocians.Cawkwell, p.66. Conversely, the city-state of Pherae had allied itself with the Phocians.Sealey, p. 445. In either 354 or 353 BC the ruling clan of the city of Larissa appealed to Philip II of Macedon to help them defeat Pherae.Cawkwell, p. 61Hornblower, p. 272.Buckler, p. 63. Thus, Philip brought an army into Thessaly, probably with the intention of attacking Pherae.Buckler, p. 64. Under the terms of their alliance, Lycophron of Pherae requested aid from the Phocians, and Onormarchos dispatched his brother, Phayllos with 7,000 men; however, Philip repulsed this force before it could join up with the Pheraeans.Buckler, p. 66. Onomarchos then abandoned the siege he was currently prosecuting, and brought his whole force into Thessaly to attack Philip. It is possible that Onomarchos hoped to conquer Thessaly in the process, which would both leave the Thebans isolated (Locris and Doris having already fallen to the Phocians), and give the Phocians a majority in the Amphictyonic council, thus enabling them to have the war declared over.Buckler, p. 67. Onomarchos probably brought with him 20 000 infantry, 500 cavalry and a large number of catapults, and outnumbered Philip's army. The exact details of the campaign that followed are unclear, but Onomarchos seems to have inflicted two defeats on Philip, with many Macedonians killed in the process.Diodorus XVI, 35 Sealey, pp. 447-448. Polyaenus suggests that the first of Onomarchos's victories was aided by the use of the catapults to throw stones into the Macedonian phalanx, as it climbed a slope to attack the Phocians.Polyaenus II, 38.1 After these defeats, Philip retreated to Macedon for the winter. He is said to have commented that he \\"did not run away but, like a ram, I pulled back to butt again harder\\".Cawkwell, p. 60. =Second Phocian campaign in Boeotia (c. 353 BC)= In 353 BC, Onomarchos took advantage of the fact that Thebes, financially exhausted, sent out a troop of 5,000 Theban soldiers as mercenaries to support the revolt of Artabazus, satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, against the Persian king. He led an attack against Locris and captured Thronion, which constituted a key strategic point on the route network of central mainland Greece. He turned south and invaded Doris and eventually Boeotia, where he was finally controlled by the allied Boeotians close to Chaeronea.Ashley, J.R., The Macedonian Empire: The era of Warfare under Philip II and Alexander the Great 359–323 B.C., Jefferson, North Carolina and London 1998 =Second conflict in Thessaly (c. 353 BC)= Philip returned to Thessaly the next summer (either 353 or 352 BC, depending on the chronology followed), having gathered a new army in Macedon. Philip formally requested that the Thessalians join him in the war against the Phocians; the Thessalians, even if underwhelmed by Philip's performance the previous year, realistically had little choice if they wanted to avoid being conquered by Onomarchos's army.Buckler, pp. 73-74. Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that he could, and according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry. Pagasae At some point during his campaigns in Thessaly, Philip captured the strategic port of Pagasae,Diodorus XVI, 31 which was in effect the port of Pherae.Cawkwell, p. 61. It is unclear whether this was during the first or second campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell suggest that it took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field. By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had learnt his lesson from the previous campaign, and intended to cut Pherae off from outside help before attacking it.Buckler. p. 74. Battle of Crocus Field Meanwhile, Onomarchos returned to Thessaly to try to preserve the Phocian ascendancy there, with approximately the same force as during the previous year. Furthermore, the Athenians dispatched Chares to help their Phocian allies, seeing the opportunity to strike a decisive blow against Philip. Subsequent events are unclear, but a battle was fought between the Macedonians and the Phocians, probably as Philip tried to prevent the Phocians uniting forces with the Pheraeans, and crucially, before the Athenians had arrived. According to Diodorus, the two armies met on a large plain near the sea, probably in the vicinity of Pagasae. Philip sent his men into battle wearing crown of laurel, the symbol of the Apollo; \\"as if he was the avenger...of sacrilege, and he proceeded to battle under the leadership, as it were, of the god\\".Justin VIII, 2 In the ensuing battle, the bloodiest recorded in ancient Greek history, Philip won a decisive victory against the Phocians. In total, 6,000 Phocian troops were killed including Onomarchos, and another 3,000 taken prisoner. Onomarchos was either hanged or crucified and the other prisoners drowned, as ritual demanded for temple-robbers. These punishments were designed to deny the defeated an honourable burial; Philip thus continued to present himself as the pious avenger of the sacrilege committed by the Phocians.Buckler, p. 75. Re- organisation of Thessaly It was probably in the aftermath of his victory (if not before) that the Thessalians appointed Philip archon of Thessaly.Buckler, p. 78. This was an appointment for life, and gave Philip control over all the revenues of the Thessalian Confederation, and furthermore made Philip leader of the united Thesslian army.Cawkwell, p. 62. Philip was now able to settle Thessaly at his leisure. He first probably finished the siege of Pagasae, to deny the Athenians a landing place in Thessaly. Pagasae was not part of the Thessalian Confederation, and Philip therefore took it as his own, and garrisoned it. The fall of Pagasae now left Pherae totally isolated. Lycophron, rather than suffer the fate of Onomarchos, struck a bargain with Philip, and in return for handing Pherae over to Philip, he was allowed, along with 2000 of his mercenaries, to go to Phocis.Buckler, p. 79. Philip now worked to unite the traditionally fractious cities of Thessaly under his rule. He took direct control of several cities in western Thessaly, exiling the dissidents, and in one case refounding the city with a Macedonian population; he tightened his control of Perrhaebia, and invaded Magnesia, also taking it as his own and garrisoning it; \\"when finished, he was lord of Thessaly.\\"Buckler, p. 80. Thermopylae Once satisfied with his reorganisation of Thessaly, Philip marched south to the pass of Thermopylae, the gateway to central Greece. He probably intended to follow up his victory over the Phocians by invading Phocis itself, a prospect which greatly alarmed the Athenians, since once he was past Thermopylae, he could also march on Athens. The Athenians therefore dispatched a force to Thermopylae and occupied the pass; there is some debate as to whether other contingents may have joined the Athenians at Thermopylae. The Athenians were certainly there, since the Athenian orator Demosthenes celebrated the defense of the pass in one of his speeches. Cawkwell suggests that the Athenian force was the one that Diodorus says was dispatched under Nausicles consisting of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and that they were joined by the remnants of the Phocians and the Pheraean mercenaries.Cawkwell, p. 66. However, Buckler argues that Diodorus never mentions Thermopylae, and the force under Nausicles was sent to help the Phocians the following year; instead, he believes that another Athenian force held the pass unassisted. Although it might have proved possible to force the pass, Philip did not attempt to do so, preferring not to risk a defeat after his great successes in Thessaly.Buckler, p. 81. Third phase (c. 352-346 BC) Meanwhile, the Phocians regrouped under Onomarchos's brother, Phayllos. After the huge Phocian defeats at Neon and Crocus Field, Phayllos had to resort to doubling the pay for mercenaries, in order to attract enough to replenish his army. Despite their defeats however, the majority of the Phocians were still in favour of continuing the war. Over the winter of that year, Phayllos engaged in diplomatic efforts to gather more support from Phocis's allies, and succeeding in widening the theatre of conflict in the next campaigning season.Buckler, p. 85. Uniquely in Greek history, the Phocians were able to absorb huge losses in manpower, thanks to their pillaging of Temple of Apollo, a factor which was to contribute to the war dragging on indecisively until 346 BC. =Third Phocian campaign in Boeotia (352 BC)= Third Phocian campaign in Boeotia, 352 BC =First conflict in the Peloponnese (352 BC)= =Second Phocian campaign in Epicnemidian Locris (351 BC)= =Second conflict in the Peloponnese (351 BC)= =Fourth Phocian campaign in Boeotia (351 BC)= Fourth Phocian campaign in Boeotia, and second, third and fourth Boeotian campaigns in Phocis, 351-347 BC =Second Boeotian campaign in Phocis (349 BC)= =Fifth Phocian campaign in Boeotia (349 BC)= Fifth and sixth Phocian campaigns in Boeotia, 349-347 BC =Euboea (349–348 BC)= =Third Boeotian campaign in Phocis (348 BC)= =Sixth Phocian campaign in Boeotia (347 BC)= =Fourth Boeotian campaign in Phocis (347 BC)= Philip had not involved himself in the Sacred War since his victory at the Crocus Field in 352 BC. In the meantime, it had become clear that the Sacred War could only be ended by outside intervention. The Phocians had occupied several Boeotian cities, but were running out of treasure to pay their mercenaries; conversely, the Thebans were unable to act effectively against the Phocians. The Phocian general Phalaikos was removed from his command in 347 BC, and three new generals appointed, who successfully attacked Boeotia again. The Thebans appealed to Philip for aid, and he sent a small force to their assistance. Philip sent force enough to honour his alliance with Thebes, but not enough to end the war—he desired the glory of ending the war personally, in the manner of his choosing, and on his terms.Cawkwell, p. 95.Buckley, p. 476. Settlement of the Sacred War =Preliminaries= Athens and Macedon had been at war since 356 BC, after Philip's capture of the Athenian colonies of Pydna and Potidea. Philip had then been drawn into the Sacred War, on behalf of the Thessalians, as described above. Since Athens was also a combatant in the Sacred War, the war between Athens and Macedon was inextricably linked with the progress of the Sacred War. In 352 BC, Philip's erstwhile ally, the Chalkidian League (led by Olynthos), alarmed by Philip's growing power, sought to ally themselves with Athens, in clear breach of their alliance with Philip. In response, Philip attacked Chalkidiki in 349 BC, and by 348 BC, had completely destroyed the Chalkidian League, razing Olynthos in the process. The prominent Athenian politician Philocrates had suggested offering Philip peace in 348 BC, during the Olynthian war. The war between Athens and Philip thus continued through 347 BC, as did the Sacred War.Cawkwell, p. 91. In early 346 BC, Philip let it be known that he intended to march south with the Thessalians, though not where or why. The Phocians thus made plans to defend Thermopylae, and requested assistance from the Spartans and the Athenians, probably around 14 February. The Spartans dispatched Archidamus III with 1,000 hoplites, and the Athenians ordered everyone eligible for military service under the age of 40 to be sent to the Phocians' aid. However, between the Phocians' appeal and the end of the month, all plans were upset by the return of Phalaikos to power in Phocis; the Athenians and the Spartans were subsequently told that they would not be permitted to defend Thermopylae. It is not clear from the ancient sources why Phalaikos was returned to power, nor why he adopted this dramatic change of policy. Cawkwell suggests, based on remarks of Aeschines, that the Phocian army restored Phalaikos because they had not been properly paid, and further that Phalaikos, realizing that the army could not be paid and that the Phocians could no longer hope to win the war, decided to try to negotiate a peace settlement with Philip.Cawkwell, p. 96. =Peace between Macedon and Athens= When the Athenians received this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae could no longer be defended, then Athenian security could no longer be guaranteed. By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon. The embassy had two audiences with Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for the terms of the peace settlement. The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the Athenian Assembly, along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement.Cawkwell, pp. 98-101. On 23 April, the Athenians swore to the terms of the treaty in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors. =Embassies to Philip= Bust of Philip II of Macedon, who was instrumental in ending the Third Sacred War After agreeing to the peace terms with Macedonian ambassadors in April, the Athenians dispatched a second embassy to Macedon, to extract the peace oaths from Philip; this embassy travelled to Pella at a relaxed pace, knowing that Philip was away on campaign against the Thracian king Kersebleptes.Cawkwell, p. 101. When they arrived, the Athenians (again including Demosthenes and Aeschines) were rather surprised to find embassies from all the principle combatants in the Sacred War were also present, in order to discuss a settlement to the war.Cawkwell, p. 102. When Philip returned from Thrace he received both the Athenian and other embassies. The Thebans and Thessalians requested that he take the leadership of Greece, and punish Phocis; conversely, the Phocians, supported by the Spartans and the Athenian delegations, pleaded with Philip not to attack Phocis. Philip, however, delayed making any decisions; \\"[he] sought by every means not to reveal how he intended to settle things; both sides were privately encouraged to hope that he would do as they wanted, but both were bidden not to prepare for war; a peacefully arranged concordat was at hand\\"; he also delayed taking the oaths to the Peace of Philocrates.Cawkwell, p. 103. Military preparations were ongoing in Pella during this period, but Philip told the ambassadors that they were for a campaign against Halus, a small Thessalian city which held out against him. He departed for Halus before making any pronouncements, compelling the Athenian embassy to travel with him; only when they reached Pherae did Philip finally take the oaths, enabling the Athenian ambassadors to return home. =Occupation of Thermopylae= It was in the aftermath of finally ratifying the Peace that Philip applied the coup de grace. He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks that he and his army was heading for Halus, but it seems certain that he also sent other units straight to Thermopylae. Thus, when he swore oaths to the Athenian assembly in Pherae, his troops were already very close to Thermopylae; by the time the Athenian ambassadors arrived home (9 July), Philip was already in possession of the pass. By delaying the oaths, and making what was effectively a feint against Halus, he prevented the Athenians from seeing their imminent danger, and from having time to garrison the Thermopylae.Cawkwell, p. 109.Buckley, p. 478. =Peace settlement= All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy, and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace.Cawkwell, p. 104. However, the Athenians were still ignorant of this turn of events when Phocian ambassadors came to Athens to plead for military aid around 9 July. The Athenian council recommended that the peace be rejected, and Thermopylae be occupied in order to help save Phocis; since, as far at the Athenian embassy knew, Philip's troops were still in Pherae, there seemed to be ample time to occupy the pass. By 12 July the news that Philip was \\"in the gates\\" arrived in Athens; the Athenians then knew that the situation was hopeless, and instead of acting on the previous recommendation of the council, the Assembly instead passed a motion re- affirming the Peace of Philocrates. Now that he was in control of Thermopylae, Philip could be certain of dictating the terms of the end of the Sacred War, since he could now use force against any state that did not accept his arbitration. He began by making a truce with Phalaikos on 19 July; Phalaikos surrendered Phocis to him, in return for being allowed to leave with his mercenaries and go wherever he wished.Cawkwell, p. 106. Cawkwell suggests that Phalaikos probably collaborated with Philip in 346 BC, allowing Philip to take Thermopylae in return for lenience for him and his men. Otherwise, it is difficult to see how Philip could have advertised his campaign so far in advance (and been so confident of success), and yet not been stopped at Thermopylae. Philip restored to Boeotia the cities that Phocis had captured during the war (Orchomenos, Coroneia and Corsiae), and then declared that the fate of Phocis would not be decided by him, but by the Amphictyonic Council. This caused great panic in Athens, since the Phocians could never hope for mercy from the Amphictyons, and since Athens had also (having allied with Phocis) shared in the same sacrilege.Cawkwell. p. 107. However, it is clear that Philip was dictating the terms behind the scenes;Buckley, p. 479. allowing the Amphictyons the formal responsibility allowed him to dissociate himself from the terms in the future.Cawkwell, p. 110 In return for ending the war, Macedon was made a member of the Amphictyonic council, and given the two votes which had been stripped from Phocis. This was an important moment for Philip, since membership of the Ampictyony meant that Macedon was now no longer a 'barbarian' state in Greek eyes.Hornblower, p. 275. The terms imposed on Phocis were harsh, but realistically Philip had no choice but to impose such sanctions; he needed the support of the Thessalians (sworn enemies of Phocis), and could not risk losing the prestige that he had won for his pious conduct during the war.Hornblower, p. 277. However, they were not as harsh as some of the Amphictyonic members had suggested; the Oeteans had demanded that the traditional punishment for temple robbers of being pushed over a cliff be carried out. Aside from being expelled from the Amphictyonic council, all the Phocian cities were to be destroyed, and the Phocians settled in 'villages' of no more than fifty houses; the money stolen from the temple was to be paid back at a rate of 60 talents per year; He did not, however, destroy the Phocians, and they retained their land. The Athenians, having made peace with Philip, were not penalised by the Amphictyonic council, and the Spartans also seem to have escaped lightly.Cawkwell, p. 108. Philip presided over the Amphictyonic festival in the autumn, and then much to the surprise of the Greeks, he went back to Macedon and did not return to Greece for seven years. He did however retain his access, by garrisoning Nicaea, the closest town to Thermopylae, with Thessalian troops. Aftermath The destruction of the Phocian cities and the heavy fine imposed on the Phocian confederation certainly caused the Phocians to bear a grudge against Philip II. Seven years later the Locrians brought charges against the Athenians in the amphictyonic council and a special session of the council was set in order to deal with that matter. The Athenians, however, did not send envoys and neither did the Thebans. This was a clear insult to the council and Philip II intervened once more as a regulator. The Fourth Sacred War broke out, ending in the total subjugation of Greece to the kingdom of Macedonia. The Phocians recovered gradually from the repercussions of the Third Sacred War and managed to be reinstated in the Amphictyony in 279 BC, when they joined forces with the Aetolian League fighting against the Gauls. However, a serious side-loss of the Third Sacred War remained the destruction of a large number of ex votos and other precious offerings to the sanctuary of Apollo, which deprived not only the sanctuary itself but also the later generations of some magnificent pieces of art.

He was prominent in the government of Shehu Shagari, serving as Minister of Social Development, Youth and Sports (1979-1981), Minister of State of Finance (1981), Minister of Aviation (1981-1982) and FCT Minister (1982-1983) Born in Safana, Northern region of Nigeria, Danmusa obtained in General Certificate Education through self study and then proceeded to the Institute of Administration, Ahmadu Bello University. He started work in the civil service, beginning at Katsina Native Authority before transferring service to North Central State. His foray in politics began in 1977 when he became a member of the Constituent Assembly, thereafter he pitched his tent with the National Party of Nigeria in the 1979 elections. In 1982, he succeeded John Kadiya as FCT minister, at the time, two districts within the capital city's phase one plan were moving towards completion. During the regime, there was focus on developing infrastructure in the accelerated district later known as Garki, this district will accommodate the first civil service workers and construction workers. The other is the North-West district (Wuse) which was also nearing completion. During the fourth republic, Danmusa was National Vice Chairman of the People's Democratic Party in 1999. In 2006, he was a member of the Board of Trustees of PDP and was campaign coordinator of the failed presidential bid of Gov Victor Attah. He comes from a respectable family from the long line of the Abubakar Danmusa family also known as Yandakawa which its ancestors can be traced back to Mali. He is the 6th born out of 27 children. his father Alhaji Abubakar Danmusa was the king of the town, Danmusa in Katsina state who isn't actually from there but migrated with his family.

He fought in the Easter Rising in the GPO and was a member of the IRA during the war of independence.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8Doe-I-4Z4 He later became Chief of Staff of the Irish Army. Background Sweeney was born and raised in Burtonport, a town in The Rosses, a district in the west of County Donegal in Ulster. He came from an Irish Nationalist family; his father had been jailed during the Land War as well as being a president of the local branch of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and a founder of the Irish Volunteers in Donegal. He received his secondary education at St. Enda's School in Rathfarnham, where Patrick Pearse was Headmaster.O’Donnell, Peadar The Gates Flew Open (1932) Ch 24 Pearse solidified Sweeney's nationalist beliefs, and in 1914 Sweeney joined the Irish Volunteers himself. By September 1914 he was a student in University College Dublin and he had transferred to Pearse's unit in the Dublin Brigade, who styled themselves \\"Pearse's own\\" and had many former students of Pearse amongst their number. In 1915 Sweeney was sworn into the Irish Republican Brotherhood by Pearse. Easter Rising Sweeney was active during the events of the Easter Rising, where he fought in Dublin's Liberty Hall and later the GPO. Following the surrender of rebel forces, Sweeney was interned in Frongoch internment camp in Wales. By October 1916, he'd been released, whereupon he rejoined the Volunteers and once again resumed his studies at UCD. During following summers he returned to Donegal and reorganised the Volunteers in that county. Irish Revolutionary Period In 1918 Sweeney was suffering from influenza and decided to take a break from UCD and return to Donegal. While there he was appointed a commandant of the local Volunteers as well as being elected as a Sinn Féin MP for West Donegal in the 1918 Irish general election, defeating the sitting nationalist Hugh Law. Aged 21, Had he taken his seat in the British Commons he would have been the youngest member of the house, however as per Sinn Féin's abstentionist policy he did not and instead attended the meeting of the first Dáil, the new parliament of Ireland created by the Nationalists. He was the youngest Teachta Dála that day and he remains second youngest ever TD to date. In March 1920 he was arrested and jailed by the British authorities, first being sent to Belfast before being transferred to Wormwood Scrubs, London. He was released in April 1920 following his participation in a mass hunger strike by Irish prisoners against their imprisonment. Following his release, he became Officer Commanding of the West Donegal Brigade of the Irish Republican Army and fought in the Irish War of Independence. During that time he rose through the ranks and became the commanding officer of the 1st Northern Division. Following the end of the War of Independence and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Sweeney choose the Pro-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War. In the lead-up to the civil war, he was involved in smuggling arms across the border to northern nationalists, which lead to clashes with British troops. During one such clash seven of his men were killed at Pettigo. In 1921 he was one of six Sinn Féin candidates elected unopposed to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland for Donegal. Again he did not attend and instead participated in the Second Dáil. In 1922 he was re-elected as a Pro-Treaty Sinn Féin candidate for Donegal and participated in the Third Dáil. During the Civil War, he was made a General in the newly formed National Army and placed in command of its units in the North-West of the Island. The period saw Sweeney execute a number of captured Republicans, including a former friend, Charlie Daly. Life in the Irish Free State In 1923 he choose to leave politics and did not try to retain his seat as a TD. Instead, he remained in the National Army. In 1924 he was briefly acting Chief of Staff during the Irish Army Mutiny. By 1929 he had risen to the rank of Chief of Staff proper, a promotion that happened to coincide with the rise of Fianna Fáil to government. Many feared an outbreak of violence once again if Cumann na nGaedhael did not accept this change. Sweeney declared his view on the matter, stating that will of the people would be protected under his command. Sweeney remained in the Army until his retirement in December 1940. He later became Secretary of the Irish Red Cross in the Republic of Ireland. Having spent most of his life in Dublin, he died in 1980 aged 83 before being buried in a full military ceremony back in Donegal.

Series Eight's unusual episode count (twelve episodes, originally thirteen before an episode was dropped, and the 1985 Christmas Special which was filmed as part of the Series Eight filming block) owes to the fact that it was originally penned as a double- length series, that the BBC could choose to break over two separate series of broadcasts if they so opted to, as they had done with Series Three and Four; and the DVD releases also reflect this option by releasing Series Eight as two halves, although ultimately Series Eight was broadcast as one long series. A run-down of upcoming episodes in several BBC in-house literature for the then- forthcoming 1984-85 production season makes mention of an ultimately 'missing' final episode of Series 8, \\"Computer Games\\"; Although a script for this episode exists, the episode doesn't appear to have entered production, seemingly due to the final recording slot instead given over to recording the 1985 Christmas Special.

In that way, regular categories recapture many properties of abelian categories, like the existence of images, without requiring additivity. At the same time, regular categories provide a foundation for the study of a fragment of first-order logic, known as regular logic.  Definition  A category C is called regular if it satisfies the following three properties:Pedicchio & Tholen (2004) p.177 * C is finitely complete. * If f : X → Y is a morphism in C, and Image:Regular_category_1.png : is a pullback, then the coequalizer of p0, p1 exists. The pair (p0, p1) is called the kernel pair of f. Being a pullback, the kernel pair is unique up to a unique isomorphism. * If f : X → Y is a morphism in C, and Image:Regular_category_2.png : is a pullback, and if f is a regular epimorphism, then g is a regular epimorphism as well. A regular epimorphism is an epimorphism that appears as a coequalizer of some pair of morphisms.  Examples  Examples of regular categories include: * Set, the category of sets and functions between the sets * More generally, every elementary topos * Grp, the category of groups and group homomorphisms * The category of rings and ring homomorphisms * More generally, the category of models of any variety * Every bounded meet- semilattice, with morphisms given by the order relation * Every abelian category The following categories are not regular: * Top, the category of topological spaces and continuous functions * Cat, the category of small categories and functors  Epi-mono factorization  In a regular category, the regular-epimorphisms and the monomorphisms form a factorization system. Every morphism f:X→Y can be factorized into a regular epimorphism e:X→E followed by a monomorphism m:E→Y, so that f=me. The factorization is unique in the sense that if e':X→E' is another regular epimorphism and m':E'→Y is another monomorphism such that f=m'e', then there exists an isomorphism h:E→E' such that he=e' and m'h=m. The monomorphism m is called the image of f.  Exact sequences and regular functors  In a regular category, a diagram of the form R\\\\rightrightarrows X\\\\to Y is said to be an exact sequence if it is both a coequalizer and a kernel pair. The terminology is a generalization of exact sequences in homological algebra: in an abelian category, a diagram :R\\\\;\\\\overset r{\\\\underset s\\\\rightrightarrows}\\\\; X\\\\xrightarrow{f} Y is exact in this sense if and only if 0\\\\to R\\\\xrightarrow{(r,s)}X\\\\oplus X\\\\xrightarrow{(f,-f)} Y\\\\to 0 is a short exact sequence in the usual sense. A functor between regular categories is called regular, if it preserves finite limits and coequalizers of kernel pairs. A functor is regular if and only if it preserves finite limits and exact sequences. For this reason, regular functors are sometimes called exact functors. Functors that preserve finite limits are often said to be left exact.  Regular logic and regular categories  Regular logic is the fragment of first-order logic that can express statements of the form \\\\forall x (\\\\phi (x) \\\\to \\\\psi (x)), where \\\\phi and \\\\psi are regular formulae i.e. formulae built up from atomic formulae, the truth constant, binary meets (conjunction) and existential quantification. Such formulae can be interpreted in a regular category, and the interpretation is a model of a sequent \\\\forall x (\\\\phi (x) \\\\to \\\\psi (x)), if the interpretation of \\\\phi factors through the interpretation of \\\\psi.Carsten Butz (1998), Regular Categories and Regular Logic, BRICS Lectures Series LS-98-2, (1998). This gives for each theory (set of sequents) T and for each regular category C a category Mod(T,C) of models of T in C. This construction gives a functor Mod(T,-):RegCat→Cat from the category RegCat of small regular categories and regular functors to small categories. It is an important result that for each theory T there is a regular category R(T), such that for each regular category C there is an equivalence \\\\mathbf{Mod}(T,C)\\\\cong \\\\mathbf{RegCat}(R(T),C), which is natural in C. Here, R(T) is called the classifying category of the regular theory T. Up to equivalence any small regular category arises in this way as the classifying category of some regular theory.  Exact (effective) categories  The theory of equivalence relations is a regular theory. An equivalence relation on an object X of a regular category is a monomorphism into X \\\\times X that satisfies the interpretations of the conditions for reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity. Every kernel pair p_0, p_1: R \\\\rightarrow X defines an equivalence relation R \\\\rightarrow X \\\\times X. Conversely, an equivalence relation is said to be effective if it arises as a kernel pair.Pedicchio & Tholen (2004) p.169 An equivalence relation is effective if and only if it has a coequalizer and it is the kernel pair of this. A regular category is said to be exact, or exact in the sense of Barr, or effective regular, if every equivalence relation is effective.Pedicchio & Tholen (2004) p.179 (Note that the term \\"exact category\\" is also used differently, for the exact categories in the sense of Quillen.) = Examples of exact categories = * The category of sets is exact in this sense, and so is any (elementary) topos. Every equivalence relation has a coequalizer, which is found by taking equivalence classes. * Every abelian category is exact. * Every category that is monadic over the category of sets is exact. * The category of Stone spaces is regular, but not exact.

A hydraulic pump is a mechanical source of power that converts mechanical power into hydraulic energy (hydrostatic energy i.e. flow, pressure). It generates flow with enough power to overcome pressure induced by the load at the pump outlet. When a hydraulic pump operates, it creates a vacuum at the pump inlet, which forces liquid from the reservoir into the inlet line to the pump and by mechanical action delivers this liquid to the pump outlet and forces it into the hydraulic system. Hydrostatic pumps are positive displacement pumps while hydrodynamic pumps can be fixed displacement pumps, in which the displacement (flow through the pump per rotation of the pump) cannot be adjusted, or variable displacement pumps, which have a more complicated construction that allows the displacement to be adjusted. Hydrodynamic pumps are more frequent in day-to-day life. Hydrostatic pumps of various types all work on the principle of Pascal's law. Gearpump with external teeth, note the rotational direction of the gears. Hydraulic pump types =Gear pumps= Gearpump with internal teeth Gear pumps (with external teeth) (fixed displacement) are simple and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of gear pumps for hydraulics will be between about 1 to 200 millilitres. They have the lowest volumetric efficiency ( \\\\eta_v \\\\approx 90 \\\\% ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps)Parr, Andrew (2011). \\"Hydraulics and Pneumatics a technician's and engineer's guide\\", p. 38. Elsevier. These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. Some gear pumps can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern gear pumps are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear and causes the unit to seize or break down. A gerotor (image does not show intake or exhaust) =Rotary vane pumps= Fixed displacement vane pump A rotary vane pump is a positive-displacement pump that consists of vanes mounted to a rotor that rotates inside a cavity. In some cases these vanes can have variable length and/or be tensioned to maintain contact with the walls as the pump rotates A critical element in vane pump design is how the vanes are pushed into contact with the pump housing, and how the vane tips are machined at this very point. Several type of \\"lip\\" designs are used, and the main objective is to provide a tight seal between the inside of the housing and the vane, and at the same time to minimize wear and metal-to-metal contact. Forcing the vane out of the rotating centre and towards the pump housing is accomplished using spring-loaded vanes, or more traditionally, vanes loaded hydrodynamically (via the pressurized system fluid). =Screw pumps= Principle of screw pump (Saugseite = intake, Druckseite = outflow) Screw pumps (fixed displacement) consist of two Archimedes' screws that intermesh and are enclosed within the same chamber. These pumps are used for high flows at relatively low pressure (max ). They were used on board ships where a constant pressure hydraulic system extended through the whole ship, especially to control ball valves but also to help drive the steering gear and other systems. The advantage of the screw pumps is the low sound level of these pumps; however, the efficiency is not high. The major problem of screw pumps is that the hydraulic reaction force is transmitted in a direction that's axially opposed to the direction of the flow. There are two ways to overcome this problem: # put a thrust bearing beneath each rotor; # create a hydraulic balance by directing a hydraulic force to a piston under the rotor. Types of screw pumps: # single end # double end # single rotor # multi rotor timed # multi rotor untimed. =Bent axis pumps= Bent axis pumps, axial piston pumps and motors using the bent axis principle, fixed or adjustable displacement, exists in two different basic designs. The Thoma-principle (engineer Hans Thoma, Germany, patent 1935) with max 25 degrees angle and the Wahlmark-principle (Gunnar Axel Wahlmark, patent 1960) with spherical-shaped pistons in one piece with the piston rod, piston rings, and maximum 40 degrees between the driveshaft centreline and pistons (Volvo Hydraulics Co.). These have the best efficiency of all pumps. Although in general the largest displacements are approximately one litre per revolution, if necessary a two-liter swept volume pump can be built. Often variable-displacement pumps are used, so that the oil flow can be adjusted carefully. These pumps can in general work with a working pressure of up to 350–420 bars in continuous work. =Inline axial piston pumps= Axial piston pump, swashplate principle By using different compensation techniques, the variable displacement type of these pumps can continuously alter fluid discharge per revolution and system pressure based on load requirements, maximum pressure cut-off settings, horsepower/ratio control, and even fully electroproportional systems, requiring no other input than electrical signals. This makes them potentially hugely power saving compared to other constant flow pumps in systems where prime mover/diesel/electric motor rotational speed is constant and required fluid flow is non-constant. =Radial piston pumps= Radial piston pump A radial piston pump is a form of hydraulic pump. The working pistons extend in a radial direction symmetrically around the drive shaft, in contrast to the axial piston pump.

Assuming the monster is dead, Victor returns to his wife Elizabeth and daughter Emily. A police inspector named Bellbeau investigates some mysterious mutilations killings, and Victor is blackmailed by his former assistant, who lost an eye in his fight with the monster. Victor grows more and more paranoid, having terrifying nightmares about his creature, believing him to be pure evil.

Victor's daughter, Emily, spends time with her grandfather, a wise blind man who warned his son Victor about his experiments. When the monster finds his way to the grandfather's cabin, he becomes good friends with Emily and the old man, because they can see that he only wants to be loved, and they give him the name Franken. Victor wanted to rid himself of all the evidence of his experiments, so he decided to hunt the monster down and shoot him. From Emily, the monster learns about God. When a fire breaks out in the woods, Emily's mother is killed, and Franken can only rescue Emily's grandfather. When Philip tries to shoot Franken, he is accidentally killed by the monster. Emily thinks Franken did it on purpose and shoots his hand, and Franken is once again alone. He seeks refuge in a church, where gazes upon the crucifix, and notices that both Christ and himself has a hole though their hands, he breaks into tears, and begs god for forgiveness. Victor believes that his creation killed his wife, he finds him the church, but Franken escapes. The grandfather tells Emily that it was not Franken's fault that her mother died, and she sets out to find him. At the mountains, Inspector Bellbeau and his police force open fire on the monster. Emily comes to his rescue, and for the first time, Franken speaks her name. Tired of a life he never wanted, the monster commits suicide by throwing himself off of a cliff. Victor, driven mad by all the terror he caused, shoots himself in the chest. Inspector Bellbeau visits Franken's grave, as the red scarf Emily gave the monster blows away in the wind while Emily now lives with her grandfather.

History  right The El Musel port was built as a result of the industrial revolution that began in the second half of the 19th century in Asturias, based on iron and steel manufacturing and more particularly on coal mining in the central basins of the region. Right from the start, these two industrial activities were to be promoted by bankers and native and essentially foreign experts. Alejandro Aguado, Pedro Duro Benito, Policarpo Herrero Vázquez, José Tartiere Lenegre, Luis Belaunde Costa, Numa Guilhou, Adriane Paillette, Guillermo Schulz, Luis Adaro Magro, Jerónimo Ibrán Mulá and Isidoro Clausel de Coussergues are just some of the most representative names in an extensive group of industrialists and experts who were the true originators of Asturian industrialisation. The implementation of these industries was in turn to promote the progress of trade, the growth of the main urban centres and the adaptation of new communicational routes in the shape of roads, rail and ports, introducing a new capitalist production system into the region in contrast to the traditional agricultural economy. Since the 1840s, mining- industrial development was to reveal the deficient state of tracks and roads and the inadequacy of the Asturian port facilities. The regions rough orthography made communications with the Castilian meseta difficult by both road and rail (the Gijón-Oviedo-León line over the Pajares bridge did not begin running until 1884) and the only way of ensuring the sale of the new industrial products was by sea, leading the need for a large commercial port in the central area close to mines and factories. Back then, the Port of Gijón was a small dock left dry at low tide, completely inadequate to meet the demands of the new economic situation. Several alteration and extension projects were then presented by the likes of the French engineer Eugene Flachat (1848-1850) and by José Elduayen, (approved in 1853), the engineer to have planned the Langreo Railway that took the coal from the Nalón basin to the local docks of Gijón as of 1857, completing the communications between Sama and Gijón that began with the building of the coal road between 1838 and 1842. Another project was drafted by Pedro Antonio de Mesa in 1856, of which the part corresponding to the Santa Catalina or Lequerica sea wall was completed in 1864 to shelter vessels from storms while waiting their turn to load cargo. By the end of the century, projects were still being approved to enlarge the Bombé (now Claudio Alvargonzález street) and Santa Catalina quays that, after continuous delays, were not completed until the start of the next century. The growing demand for port infrastructures and the lack of means from the public authorities led to the involvement of private initiative in the enlarging, building and operating of the Local Port of Gijón. Hence, in 1870 Anselmo Cifuentes was awarded the tender to build the Victoria or El Muellín quay (where the former fish market building is located) and in 1879 La Sociedad del Fomento de Gijón was constituted to build and run the quays and docks on his behalf. Moreover, the increase in traffic and fleets from the coal industry also led to the establishing of ship repair and construction shops, with the installation in 1888 of the first industrial shipyard in Gijón on Natahoyo beach in 1888, the wharf of the company Cifuentes, Stoldtz y Cía. and today home to Naval Gijón. All of this intense activity confirmed the urgent need to kit out larger facilities to provide docks and service areas in line with the intense port traffic that existed. The shortfalls thus left the port open to new alternatives or solutions. In 1986, the bulk carrier Castillo de Salas ran aground while anchored outside El Musel. The ship was waiting for its turn to dock in the busy port.  Port of Gijón Expansion  right The Port of Gijón is the top dry bulk port in the Spanish ports system with an average annual traffic of more than 20 million tons the last years, 16 million of which are unloaded through the EBHISA dry bulk terminal. It is sixth in the general ranking of Spanish ports and the fourth in benefits. Designed in 1992 to unload a maximum of 12 million tons, has improved its unloading facilities and quays to deal with up to 17 million tons a year, although with occupancy indexes above that advised and with a vessel draught limit of 18 metres, which is detrimental to the service provided and a lack of competitiveness in relation to other ports. The forecast for iron ore and coal traffic at the Port of Gijón by the year 2010 stands at 20 million tons, notably exceeding the capacity of the present terminal. Enlarging the Port of Gijón will allow for modern, new facilities capable of meeting the needs of its customers, adapting to future demand and serving the modernisation of Asturian industry. The actual expansion project of the Port of Gijón consists of constructing a new breakwater that, starting from Cape Torres and running for a total length of 3,834 metres along three differently structured alignments, was to form a wharf containing 140 Ha of sheltered waters. It also includes the construction of a quay located to the north of the wharf that measured 1,250 metres in length with draughts ranging between 23 and 27 metres and a width of over 400 m to allow for the simultaneous berthing of three bulk carriers of and 20 metres of draught. The inner slopes located to the West and South of the wharf complete the backfill protection, with a length of 1,732 m to give a total surface area of 145 Ha with land entirely reclaimed from the sea. The new dry bulk terminal to be established in these facilities will have an unload capacity of over 25 million tons and a 60 Ha storage area to allow for the storing of up to 2 million tons of iron ore and coal. Image:Expansion.jpgExpansion project Image:Expansion3.jpgType Cross sections Image:Expansion2.jpgSituation foreseen for 2008 Investments underway =New Aboño Musel Connection= This investment was started due to the considerable increase in traffic between the Marcelino quay bulk terminal and the storage area concession on the Aboño quay level through the present tunnel that does no meet the appropriate conditions due to its sections, access slopes and complicated layout. The new track starts where the Norte Dock meets Cape Torres and includes a 390m long tunnel before running parallel to the Cape slope along the Aboño quay level to reach the current road. This track will be eminently for use by the port and, where applicable, will also allow for access to the port expansion work, separating any local traffic that may continue to use the present tunnel. =Aboño Quay Level Enlargement= This involves the provision of an 85,000 m2 area next to the northern side of the current quay level, moving the enclosure around 220 m and extending the channelling of the estuary. The enclosures will be 240m along the aforementioned extension and 430m west-east to reach the rock wall of Cape Torres. These containment walls will be made up of different sections according to the stretch, with a paving core and 50 to 4,000 kg layers of riprap and blocks of 15 to 80 t. A concrete containing wall will be built with a similar mass to the current one. Given the extensive experience of this Port Authority in the recovery of blocks, the work is to be carried out using almost all existing blocks and containing walls, which will involve a thorough study of the process to dismantle the present dock and its transferral to the new one to ensure it is protected at all times and to ensure that the fewest risks possible are taken with regard to the present facilities. =La Osa Quay Enlargement (investment underway)= The La Osa quays take their name from the sandbank of the same name on which the Levante dock was built, which protects the port from north-easterly storms. The Levante dock runs over the La Osa and La Figar sandbanks and gave its name to the most ambitious project of the Port of Gijón in the 20th century and that formed the El Musel we know today. This dock, the building of which began in 1964, together with its breakwater, has become absorbed by the La Osa Quays Enlargement project except for its initial section, reclaiming from the sea and protected by a sloping dock measuring around . in length and with variable sections. The project consists of two independent actions: A barrage and a surface area enlarging the La Osa Quays and additional Backfill of the La Osa Quays, the backfill being obtained from the dredging of sand from the port entrance. The total budget amounts to 38,000,000 euros. This project, co-financed by the European Union, assists in the reduction of social and economic disparities among EU citizens References Autoridad Portuaria Gijón External links * Autoridad Portuaria Gijón * Puertos del Estado Musel, Gijon Musel, El Musel, El Spain Category:Gijón ","title":"El Musel"},{"id":"9790976","text":"Give'n It was originally a demo released by the band Pepper in 2000.The demo was released on Cornerstone RAS.

Despite legal provisions, freedom of the press in Turkey has steadily deteriorated from 2010 onwards, with a precipitous decline following the attempted coup in July 2016. The Turkish Government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has arrested hundreds of journalists, closed or taken over dozens of media outlets, and prevented journalists and their families from traveling. By some accounts, Turkey currently accounts for one-third of all journalists imprisoned around the world. Since 2013, Freedom House ranks Turkey as \\"Not Free\\".Freedom House, Turkey 2015 Press Freedom report Reporters Without Borders ranked Turkey at the 149th place out of over 180 countries, between Mexico and DR Congo, with a score of 44.16.Reporters Without BordersTurkey In the third quarter of 2015, the independent Turkish press agency Bianet recorded a strengthening of attacks on opposition media under the Justice and Development Party (AKP) interim government. Bianet's final 2015 monitoring report confirmed this trend and underlined that, once the AKP had regained a majority in parliament after the AKP interim government period, the Turkish government further intensified its pressure on the country's media. According to Freedom House, > The government enacted new laws that expanded both the state’s power to > block websites and the surveillance capability of the National Intelligence > Organization (MİT).

Several dozen > journalists, including prominent columnists, lost their jobs as a result of > such pressure during the year, and those who remained had to operate in a > climate of increasing self-censorship and media polarization. In 2012 and 2013 the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) ranked Turkey as the worst journalist jailer in the world (ahead of Iran and China), with 49 journalists sitting in jail in 2012 and 40 in 2013. Twitter's 2014 Transparency Report showed that Turkey filed over five times more content removal requests to Twitter than any other country in the second half of 2014, with requests rising another 150% in 2015. During its 12-year rule, the ruling AKP has gradually expanded its control over media. Today, numerous newspapers, TV channels and internet portals dubbed as Yandaş Medya (\\"Partisan Media\\") or Havuz Medyası (\\"Pool Media\\") continue their heavy pro-government propaganda. Several media groups receive preferential treatment in exchange for AKP- friendly editorial policies. Some of these media organizations were acquired by AKP-friendly businesses through questionable funds and processes. Media not friendly to AKP, on the other hand, are threatened with intimidation, inspections and fines. These media group owners face similar threats to their other businesses. An increasing number of columnists have been fired for criticizing the AKP leadership.  History  Regional censorship predates the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. On 15 February 1857, the Ottoman Empire issued law governing printing houses (\\"Basmahane Nizamnamesi\\"); books first had to be shown to the governor, who forwarded them to commission for education (\\"Maarif Meclisi\\") and the police. If no objection was made, the Sultanate would then inspect them. Without censure from the Sultan books could not be legally issued.Şahhüseyinoğlu, H. Nedim. \\"Censorship of Thought and the Press from Yesterday to Today\\" (Turkish). Ankara: Paragraf, 2005. , quoted in an online summary On 24 July 1908, at the beginning of the Second Constitutional Era, censorship was lifted; however, newspapers publishing stories that were deemed a danger to interior or exterior State security were closed. Between 1909 and 1913 four journalists were killed—Hasan Fehmi, Ahmet Samim, Zeki Bey, and Hasan Tahsin (Silahçı).Radikal of 24 July 2001; article in Turkish by Ahmet Çakır Following the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924, the Sheikh Said rebellion broke out as part of the complex ethnic conflict that erupted with the creation of a secular Turkish nationalist identity that was rejected by Kurds, who had long been loyal subjects of the Caliph. Sheikh Said, a Naqshbandi sheikh, accused Turkish nationalists of having \\"reduced the Caliph to the state of a parasite\\". The uprising was crushed brutally and martial law was imposed on February 25, 1925. Disagreement in the ruling Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi (Republican People's Party) ultimately favored more hardline measures and under İsmet İnönü's leadership, the Takrir-i Sükun Kanunu was proposed on March 4, 1925. This law granted the government unchecked powers, and had a number of consequences including the closure of all newspapers except for Cumhuriyet and Hakimiyet-i Milliye (both were official or semi-official state publications). The effect was to censor any criticsm of the ruling party, and socialists and communists were arrested and tried by the Independence Tribunals that were established in Ankara under the law. Tevhid-i Efkar, Sebül Reşat, Aydınlık, Resimli Ay, and Vatan, were among the newspapers closed and several journalists arrested and tried at the tribunals. The tribunals also closed down the offices of opposition party Terakkiperver Cumhuriyet Fırkası on June 3, 1925 under the pretext that their openly stated support for the protection of religious customs had contributed to the Sheikh Said rebellion. During World War II (1939–1945) many newspapers were ordered shut, including the dailies Cumhuriyet (5 times, for 5 months and 9 days), Tan (7 times, for 2 months and 13 days), and Vatan (9 times, for 7 months and 24 days). When the Democrat Party under Adnan Menderes came to power in 1950, censorship entered a new phase. The Press Law changed, sentences and fines were increased. Several newspapers were ordered shut, including the dailies Ulus (unlimited ban), Hürriyet, Tercüman, and Hergün (two weeks each). In April 1960, a so-called investigation commission (\\"Tahkikat Komisyonu\\") was established by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. It was given the power to confiscate publications, close papers and printing houses. Anyone not following the decisions of the commission were subject to imprisonment, between one and three years. Freedom of speech was heavily restricted after the 1980 military coup headed by General Kenan Evren. During the 1980s and 1990s, broaching the topics of secularism, minority rights (in particular the Kurdish issue), and the role of the military in politics risked reprisal.Questions and Answers: Freedom of Expression and Language Rights in Turkey, Human Rights Watch, April 2002 Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law (Law 3713), slightly amended in 1995 and later repealed, imposed three-year prison sentences for \\"separatist propaganda.\\" Despite its name, the Anti-Terror Law punished many non-violent offences. Pacifists have been imprisoned under Article 8. For example, publisher Fatih Tas was prosecuted in 2002 under Article 8 at Istanbul State Security Court for translating and publishing writings by Noam Chomsky, summarizing the history of human rights violations in southeast Turkey; he was acquitted, however, in February 2002. Prominent female publisher Ayşe Nur Zarakolu, who was described by The New York Times as \\"[o]ne of the most relentless challengers to Turkey's press laws\\", was imprisoned under Article 8 four times. Since 2011, the AKP government has increased restrictions on freedom of speech, freedom of the press and internet use, and television content, as well as the right to free assembly. It has also developed links with media groups, and used administrative and legal measures (including, in one case, a $2.5 billion tax fine) against critical media groups and critical journalists: \\"over the last decade the AKP has built an informal, powerful, coalition of party-affiliated businessmen and media outlets whose livelihoods depend on the political order that Erdogan is constructing. Those who resist do so at their own risk.\\"Foreign Policy, 2 June 2013, How Democratic Is Turkey? Since his time as prime minister through to his presidency Erdogan has sought to control the press, forbidding coverage, restricting internet use and stepping up repression on journalists and media outlets. NTV broadcast van covered with protest graffiti during the Gezi Park protests, in response to relative lack of coverage of mainstream media of the protests, 1 June 2013 Foreign media noted that, particularly in the early days (31 May – 2 June 2013) of the Gezi Park protests, the events attracted relatively little mainstream media coverage in Turkey, due to either government pressure on media groups' business interests or simply ideological sympathy by media outlets.BBC, 4 June 2013, Turks deprived of TV turn to Twitter for protest news The BBC noted that while some outlets are aligned with the AKP or are personally close to Erdoğan, \\"most mainstream media outlets – such as TV news channels HaberTurk and NTV, and the major centrist daily Milliyet – are loath to irritate the government because their owners' business interests at times rely on government support. All of these have tended to steer clear of covering the demonstrations.\\" Ulusal Kanal and Halk TV provided extensive live coverage from Gezi park.Deutsche Welle, 1 June 2013, Solidarity with Istanbul protesters grows in Turkey and abroad Turkey's Journalists Union estimated that at least \\"72 journalists had been fired or forced to take leave or had resigned in the past six weeks since the start of the unrest\\" in late May 2013 due to pressure from the AKP government. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, head of the Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi (CHP) party, said 64 journalists have been imprisoned and “We are now facing a new period where the media is controlled by the government and the police and where most media bosses take orders from political authorities.” The government says most of the imprisoned journalists have been detained for serious crimes, like membership in an armed terrorist group, that are not related to journalism.\\"Turkey: 72 Journalists Forced Out for Covering Protests, Union Says\\", The New York Times (Reuters), 23 July 2013.

Bianet's periodical reports on freedom of the press in Turkey published in October 2015 recorded a strengthening of attacks on the opposition media during the AKP interim government in the third quarter of 2015. Bianet recorded the censorship of 101 websites, 40 Twitter accounts, 178 news; attacks against 21 journalists, three media organs, and one printing house; civil pursuits against 28 journalists; and the six-fold increase of arrests of media representatives, with 24 journalists and 9 distributors imprisoned.Bianet, Increasing Pressure on Press: Democracy in Question, MEDIA MONITORING REPORT 2015 3RD QUARTER. The increased criminalisation of the media follows the freezing of the Kurdish peace process and the failure of AKP to obtain an outright majority at the June 2015 election and to achieve the presidentialisation of the political system. Several journalists and editors are tried for being allegedly members of unlawful organisations, linked to either Kurds or the Gülen movement, others for alleged insults to religion and to the President. In 2015 Cumhuriyet daily and Doğan Holding were investigated for \\"terror\\", \\"espionage\\" and \\"insult\\". On the date of Bianet's publication, 61 people, of whom 37 journalists, were convict, defendant or suspect for having insulted or personally attacked the then-PM, now-President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The European Court of Human Rights condemned Turkey for violation of the freedom of expression in the Abdurrahman Dilipak case (Sledgehammer investigation),Bianet on the Dilipak caseEuropean Court of Human Rights Press Release , 15 September 2015, p.5-6 and the Turkish Constitutional Court upheld the violation of the freedom of expression of five persons, including a journalist. RTÜK could not yet choose its President; it still warned companies five times and fined them six times. The Supreme Electoral Council ordered 65 channels twice to stop broadcasting the results of the June 2015 election before the end of the publishing ban. Attack to media freedom went far beyond the AKP interim government period. The January 2016 updated Bianet's report confirmed this alarming trend, underlining that the whole 2014 figure of arrested journalists increased in 2015, reaching the number of 31 journalists arrested (22 in 2014) Once regained the majority on November 1, 2015 elections, the Turkish government intensified the pressure on the country's media, for example by banning some TV channels, in particular those linked to the Fethullah Gülen movement, from digital platforms and by seizing control of their broadcasting. In November 2015, Can Dündar, Cumhuriyet's editor in chief and its Ankara representative Erdem Gül were arrested on charges of belonging to a terror organisation, espionage and for having allegedly disclosed confidential information. Investigation against the two journalists were launched after the newspaper documented the transfer of weapons from Turkey to Syria in trucks of the National Intelligence Organization previously involved in the MİT trucks scandal. Dündar and Gül were released in February 2016 when the Supreme Court decided that their detention was undue. In July 2016, in the occasion of the launch of the campaign \\"I'm a journalist\\", Mehmet Koksal, project officer of the European Federation of Journalists declared that \\"Turkey has the largest number of journalists in jail out of all the countries in the Council of Europe. The situation further deteriorated as consequence of the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt of 15 July 2016 and the subsequent government reaction, leading to an increase of attacks targeting the media in Turkey. Mustafa Cambaz, a photojournalist working for the daily Yeni Şafak was killed during the coup. Turkish soldiers attempting to overthrow the government took control of several newsrooms, including the Ankara-based headquarter of the state broadcaster TRT. They also forced a TV channel's anchor to read a statement at gunpoint while the member of the editorial board were held hostage and threatened. Also, soldiers seized the offices in Istanbul of Doğan Media Center which hosted several media outles, including Hürriyet daily newspaper and the private TV station CNN Türk, holding journalists and other professionals hostage for many hours during the night. During the coup's night, in the streets of Istanbul, a photojournalist working for Hürriyet and the Associated Press was assaulted by civilians that were demonstrating against the coup. In the following days, after the government regained power, the state regulatory authority named Information Technologies and Communications Authority shut down 20 independent online news portals. On July 19, the Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council decided to revoke the licence of 24 TV channels and radio stations for being allegedly connected to the Gülen community, without providing much details on this decision. Also, following the decision of declaring the state of emergency for three months taken on 21 July, a series of limitation to freedom of expression and freedom of the media have been imposed. The measures within the regime of emergency include the possibility to ban printing, copying, publishing and distributing newspapers, magazines, books and leaflets. An editorial criticizing press censorship published May 22, 2015 and inclusion of Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as one of a rising class of \\"soft\\" dictators in an op-ed published in May 2015 in The New York Times resulted in a strong reaction by Erdogan. In an interview Dündar gave in July 2016, before the coup attempt and the government reaction, the journalist stated that \\"Turkey is going through its darkest period, journalism-wise. In has never been an easy country for journalists, but I think today it has reached its lowest point and is experiencing unprecedented repression\\".  Legislative framework  The Constitution of Turkey, at art. 28, states that the press is free and shall not be censored. Expressions of non-violent opinion are safeguarded by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Turkey in 1954, and various provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed by Turkey in 2000. Many Turkish citizens convicted under the laws mentioned below have applied to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and won their cases. Yet, Constitutional and international guarantees are undermined by restrictive provisions in the Criminal Code, Criminal Procedure Code, and anti-terrorism laws, effectively leaving prosecutors and judges with ample discretion to repress ordinary journalistic activities. The 2017 Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights' report on freedom of expression and media freedom in Turkey reiterated that censorship problems stem mainly from the Turkish Criminal Code and the Turkish Anti- Terrorism Law No. 3713. Prosecutors continued to bring a number of cases for terrorism or membership of an armed organization mainly based on certain statements of the accused, as coinciding with the aims of such organization. Beside the Article 301, amended in 2008, and Article 312, more than 300 provisions constrained freedom of expression, religion, and association, according to the Turkish Human Rights Association (2002). Article No. 299 of the Turkish Criminal Code provides for criminal defamation of the Head of the State. which is being increasingly enforced. 18 persons were in prison for this offence as of June 2016. Article No. 295 of the Criminal Code is increasingly being enforced as well, imposing a “press silence” (Yayın Yasağı) on topics of relevant public interest such as terrorist attacks and bloody blasts. The silence can be imposed on TVs, print media, radios as well as to Internet content, hosting and service providers. Violating this norm can lead up to three years of detention. Many of the repressive provisions found in the Press Law, the Political Parties Law, the Trade Union Law, the Law on Associations, and other legislation were imposed by the military junta after its coup in 1980. As to the Internet, the relevant Law is Law No. 5651 of 2007. According to the Council of Europe Commissioner and to the Venice Commission for Democracy through Law, the decrees issued under the state of emergency since July 2016, conferred an almost limitless discretionay power to the Turkish executive to apply sweeping misure against NGOs, the media and the public sector. Specifically, many NGOs were closed, the media organizations seized or shut down and public sector employees as well as journalists and media workers arrested or intimidated. =Article 299= Article 299 is a provision in the Turkish Penal Code that criminalizes insulting the President of Turkey. The article has been part of Turkey's penal code since 1926, but had rarely been used before Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's becoming President. The article states: > (1) The person who insults the President shall be punished by imprisonment > from 1 year to 4 years. (2) If the crime is committed publicly, the > punishment will be increased by 1/6. (3) For this crime to be prosecuted, > the permission of the Justice Ministry shall be necessary. The article has been widely used to suppress freedom of expression and as per the Stockholm Center for Freedom, thousands have been imprisoned since 2014 when Recep Tayyip Erdoğan became President. In 2019 alone, more than 36,000 people including 318 minors between the ages 12 and 17 faced criminal investigations for \\"insulting\\" Erdoğan. According to human rights lawyer Kerem Altıparmak, over 100,000 Turkish citizens have been investigated and over 30,000 court cases been opened under this provision. The list of persons includes human rights activists, members of parliament, lawyers, journalists, TV show actors, students, writers, artists, cartoonists, ordinary citizens and even minors below the age of 17. =Article 301= Article 301 is a provision in the Turkish penal code that, since 2005 made it a punishable offense to insult Turkishness or various official Turkish institutions. Charges were brought in more than 60 cases, some of which were high-profile.Lea, Richard. In Istanbul, a writer awaits her day in court, The Guardian, July 24, 2006. The article was amended in 2008, including changing \\"Turkishness\\" into \\"the Turkish nation\\", reducing maximum prison terms to 2 years, and making it obligatory to get the approval of the Minister of Justice before filing a case.CafeSiyaset: 301 yeni hali ile yürürlüğe girdi (\\"New version of Article 301 takes effect\\") Changes were deemed \\"largely cosmetic\\" by Freedom House, although the number of prosecutions dropped. Although only few persons were convicted, trials under Art. 301 are seen by human rights watchdogs as a punitive measure in themselves, as time-consuming and expensive, thus exerting a chilling effect on free speech. * Novelist Orhan Pamuk, at the time a Nobel Prize candidate, was prosecuted under Article 301 for discussing the Armenian Genocide; Pamuk subsequently won the prize. * Perihan Mağden, a columnist for the newspaper Radikal, was tried under the article for provocation, and acquitted on July 27, 2006; Mağden had broached the topic of conscientious objection to mandatory military service as an abuse of human rights. * The case of the Academics for Peace is also relevant: on January 14, 2016, 27 academics were detained for interrogations after having signed a petition with more than other 1.000 people asking for Peace in the South- East of the country, where there are ongoing violent clashes between the Turkish Army and the PKK. The academics accused the government of breaching international law. An investigation started upon those academics under charges of “terrorism propaganda”, “incitement to hatred and enmity” and for “insulting the State” under Article No. 301 of the Turkish Criminal Code. =Article 312= Article 312 of the criminal code imposes three-year prison sentences for incitement to commit an offence and incitement to religious or racial hatred. In 1999 the mayor of Istanbul and current president Recep Tayyip Erdogan was sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment under Article 312 for reading a few lines from a poem that had been authorized by the Ministry of Education for use in schools, and consequently had to resign. In 2000 the chairman of the Human Rights Association, Akin Birdal, was imprisoned under Article 312 for a speech in which he called for \\"peace and understanding\\" between Kurds and Turks, and thereafter forced to resign, as the Law on Associations forbids persons who breach this and several other laws from serving as association officials. On February 6, 2002, a \\"mini-democracy package\\" was voted by Parliament, altering wording of Art. 312. Under the revised text, incitement can only be punished if it presents \\"a possible threat to public order.\\" The package also reduced the prison sentences for Article 159 of the criminal code from a maximum of six years to three years. None of the other laws had been amended or repealed as of 2002. =Other= Defamation and libel remain criminal charges in Turkey (Article 125 of the Penal Code). They often result in fines and jail terms. Bianet counted 10 journalists convicted of defamation, blasphemy or incitement to hatred in 2014. Article 216 of the Penal Code, banning incitement of hatred and violence on grounds of ethnicity, class or religion (with penalties of up to 3 years), is also used against journalists and media workers. Article 314 of the Penal Code is often invoked against journalists, particularly Kurds and leftists, due to its broad definition of terrorism and of membership in an armed organisation. It carries a minimum sentence of 7,5 years. According to the OSCE, most of 22 jailed journalists as of June 2014 had been charged or condemned based on Art. 314. Article 81 of the Political Parties Law (imposed by the military junta in 1982) forbids parties from using any language other than Turkish in their written material or at any formal or public meetings. This law is strictly enforced. Kurdish deputy Leyla Zana was jailed in 1994, ostensibly for membership to the PKK. In 1991, laws outlawing communist (Articles 141 and 142 of the criminal code) and Islamic fundamentalist ideas (Article 163 of the criminal code) were repealed. This package of legal changes substantially freed up expression of leftist thought, but simultaneously created a new offence of \\"separatist propaganda\\" under Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law. Prosecutors also began to use Article 312 of the criminal code (on religious or racial hatred) in place of Article 163. The 1991 antiterrorism law (the Law on the Fight against Terrorism) has been invoked to charge and imprison journalists for activities that Human Rights Watch define as “nonviolent political association” and speech. The European Court of Human Rights has in multiple occasions found the law to amount to censorship and breach of freedom of expression. Constitutional amendments adopted in October 2001 removed mention of \\"language forbidden by law\\" from legal provisions concerning free expression. Thereafter, university students began a campaign for optional courses in Kurdish to be put on the university curriculum, triggering more than 1,000 detentions throughout Turkey during December and January 2002. Actions have also been taken against the Laz minority. According to the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey only recognizes the language rights of the Jewish, Greek and Armenian minorities. The government ignores Article 39(4) of the Treaty of Lausanne, which states that: \\"[n]o restrictions shall be imposed on the free use by any Turkish national of any language in private intercourse, in commerce, religion, in the press or in publications of any kind or at public meetings.\\" Pressured by the EU, Turkey has promised to review the Broadcasting Law. Other legal changes in August 2002 allowed for the teaching of languages, including Kurdish. However, limitations on Kurdish broadcasting continue to be strong: according to the EU Commission (2006), \\"time restrictions apply, with the exception of films and music programmes. All broadcasts, except songs, must be subtitled or translated in Turkish, which makes live broadcasts technically cumbersome. Educational programmes teaching the Kurdish language are not allowed. The Turkish Public Television (TRT) has continued broadcasting in five languages including Kurdish. However, the duration and scope of TRT's national broadcasts in five languages is very limited. No private broadcaster at national level has applied for broadcasting in languages other than Turkish since the enactment of the 2004 legislation.\\" TRT broadcasts in Kurdish (as well as in Arab and Circassian dialect) are symbolic,Turkish TV allows Kurds airtime, BBC News, 9 June 2004 compared to satellite broadcasts by channels such as controversial Roj TV, based in Denmark. In 2003 Turkey adopted a freedom of information law. Yet, state secrets that may harm national security, economic interests, state investigations, or intelligence activity, or that “violate the private life of the individual,” are exempt from requests. This has made accessing official information particularly difficult. Amendments in 2013 (the Fourth Judicial Reform package), spurred by the EU accession process and a renewed Kurdish peace process, amended several laws. Antiterrorism regulations were tweaked so that publication of statements of illegal groups would only be a crime if the statement included coercion, violence, or genuine threats. Yet, the reform was deemed as not reaching international human rights standards, since it did not touch upon problematic norms such as the Articles 125, 301 and 314 of the Penal Code. In 2014 a Fifth Judicial Reform package was passed, which among others reduced the maximum period pretrial detention from 10 to 5 years. Consequently, several journalists were released from jail, pending trial. New laws in 2014 were nevertheless detrimental to freedom of speech. * February 2014 amendments to the Law no. 5651 (\\"Internet Law\\") allowed the Telecommunication Authority (TİB) powers to block websites on vague grounds of privacy protection, with only ex-post court intervention within 48h to confirm the block. A September 2014 amendment to Law no. 5651 had also allowed TİB to block websites “for national security, the restoration of public order, and the prevention of crimes”; this was later overturned by the Constitutional Court in October. * April 2014 amendments to secret service regulations (Law Amending the Law on State Intelligence Services and the National Intelligence Organization) granted more powers to the MİT, including the faculty to access any personal data without a court order, as well as personal legal immunity for breaches of the law. It also made it a crime, punished with up to 9 years in prison, to acquire or publish information on MİT activities. * December 2014 amendments to the Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes made it possible to search persons or premises under simple “reasonable suspicion,” rather than “strong suspicion based on concrete evidence.” Police resorted to such grounds already in October, even before their actual approval, to raid the home of journalist Aytekin Gezici in Adana, after he had criticised the government on Twitter. * August 2016, Turkey closed the Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication which had been tasked with regulation of censorship and surveillance orders since 2005. The transfer of executive powers to the Information and Communication Technologies Authority eliminated ministerial oversight of internet blocking orders as part of a wider set of reforms to introduce an executive presidency. In June 2018, Esenyurt municipality in Istanbul has taken down Arabic shop signs, citing a new regulation stipulating that shop signs must include at least 75 percent Turkish words. Esenyurt had one of the highest populations of Syrian refugees in Istanbul after the start of the Syrian civil war and many Syrian businesses started to pop up. = ECHR oversight = Turkey is one of the Council of Europe member states with the greatest number of ECHR-recognised violations of rights included in the European Convention on Human Rights. Of these, several concern Article 10 of the Convention, on freedom of expression. * The Tanıyan v. Turkey case (no. 29910/96) concerned the confiscation orders were issued for 117 of the 126 issues of the Yeni Politika daily published in 1995, either under the Prevention of Terrorism Act or under Article 312 of the Criminal Code. The Turkish government struck a friendly settlement with Necati Tanıyan in 2005, paying EUR 7,710 in damages and recognising the \\"interference\\" and the need \\"to ensure that the amended Article 312 will be applied in accordance with the requirements of Article 10 of the Convention as interpreted in the Court's case-law\\".For the fill text of the verdict see HUDOC, search page of the ECtHR; accessed on 30 October 2012 * The Halis Doğan et al v. Turkey case (no. 50693/99) concerned 6 journalists (including Ragıp Zarakolu) who worked for the Turkish daily newspaper Özgür Bakış. The newspaper was banned from the provinces of south-east Anatolia (OHAL) in which a state of emergency had been declared on 7 May 1999. The ECHR struck the decision as unmotivated, arbitrary, and lacking a mechanism of judicial appeal.For the full text of the verdict in French see HUDOC, search page of the ECtHR; accessed on 30 October 2012 * The Demirel and Ateş v. Turkey case (no. 10037/03 and 14813/03), concerned the editor and owner of the weekly newspaper Yedinci Gündem (Seventh Order of the Day), twice fined in 2002 for publishing statements and an interview with members of the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan). The paper was also temporarily closed down. The ECHR condemned Turkey in 2007, as the controversial contents did not incite violence or constitute hate speech.For the fill text of the verdict see HUDOC, search page of the ECtHR; accessed on 30 October 2012 * The Ürper and Others v. Turkey cases (2007) concerned 26 Turkish citizens, either owners or directors and journalists of four daily newspapers (Ülkede Özgür Gündem, Gündem, Güncel and Gerçek Demokrasi) which were repeatedly suspended for up to one month each between November 2006 and October 2007, as being considered PKK propaganda outlets. The applicants were also criminally prosecuted. The ECHR in 2009 condemned the suspension of future publications based on assumptions as an unjustifiable restriction to press freedom.For the fill text of the verdict see HUDOC, search page of the ECtHR; accessed on 30 October 2012 * Özgür Gündem case (2000): Özgür Gündem is a pro- Kurdish and leftist media outlet based in Istanbul. From the beginning of the ‘90’s, the newspaper has been subject to raids and legal actions, with many journalists being arrested and even killed. The paper remained closed from 1994 to 2011 due to a court order. These facts were the bases for the Özgür Gündem v. Turkey case before the ECtHR. The applicants claimed that “the Turkish authorities had, directly or indirectly, sought to hinder, prevent and render impossible the production of Özgür Gündem by the encouragement of or acquiescence in unlawful killings and forced disappearances, by harassment and intimidation of journalists and distributors, and by failure to provide any or any adequate protection for journalists and distributors when their lives were clearly in danger and despite requests for such protection”. Concerning the police operation at the Özgür Gündem premises in Istanbul on December 10, 1993 and concerning the legal measures taken in respect of issues of the newspaper, the Strasbourg Court found that there was a breach of Article 10 ECHR. * Fırat (Hrant) Dink v. Turkey (2010): Dink was a Turkish- Armenian journalist writing for the newspaper Agos. Between 2003 and 2004 he wrote a series of articles about the identity of Turkish citizens with Armenian origins. He was charged under Article 301 in 2006 and received a six-month suspended sentence of imprisonment. This verdict did not respect the principle, stated in the official comment to the 2008 of Article 301, that a single word or expression cannot justify the resort to criminal law. In June 2007, he was murdered by a nationalist. The European Strasbourg Court (ECtHR) considered the verdict lacking of any “pressing social need” and - together with the authorities‟ failure to protect Dink against attacks of extreme nationalist groups - Turkey's “positive obligations” regarding Dink's freedom expression had not been complied with. * Ahmet Yildirim v. Turkey (2013): it concerns the Internet Law No. 5651 and the blocking of “Google Sites”, defamation, the usage of disproportionate measures and the need for restrictions to be prescribed by law.  Attacks and threats against journalists  = Physical attacks and assassinations of journalists = The physical safety of journalists in Turkey is at risk. Several journalists died in the 1990s at the height of the Kurdish–Turkish conflict. Soon after the pro-Kurdish press had started to publish the first daily newspaper by the name of \\"Özgür Gündem\\" (Free Agenda) killings of Kurdish journalists started. Hardly any of them has been clarified or resulted in sanctions for the assailants. \\"Murder by unknown assailants\\" (tr: faili meçhul) is the term used in Turkish to indicate that the perpetrators were not identified because of them being protected by the State and cases of disappearance. The list of names of distributors of Özgür Gündem and its successors that were killed (while the perpetrators mostly remained unknown) includes 18 names.Information was taken from a page called Onlarin Sayesinde -4 (Because of them -4), a page at Newededersim called Kürt basını 114 yaşında (Kurdish press aged 114) and annual reports of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey. Among the 33 journalists that were killed between 1990 and 1995 most were working for the so-called Kurdish Free Press. The killings of journalists in Turkey since 1995 are more or less individual cases. Most prominent among the victims is Hrant Dink, killed in 2007, but the death of Metin Göktepe also raised great concern, since police officers beat him to death. The death of Metin Alataş in 2010 is also a source of disagreement: While the autopsy claimed it was suicide, his family and colleagues demanded an investigation. He had formerly received death threats and had been violently assaulted. Since 2014, several Syrian journalists who were working from Turkey and reporting on the rise of Daesh have been assassinated. In 2014, journalists suffered obstruction, tear gas injuries, and physical assault by the police in several instances: while covering the February protests against internet censorship, the May Day demonstrations, as well as the Gezi Park protests anniversaries (when CNN correspondent Ivan Watson was shortly detained and roughed up). Turkish security forces fired tear gas at journalists reporting from the border close to the Syrian town of Kobane in October. * The CPJ counted one media-related killing in 2014, the one of Kadir Bağdu who was shot in Adana while delivering the pro-Kurdish daily Azadiya Welat. * The general secretary of the Turkish Journalists’ Union, Mustafa Kuleli, as well as journalist Hasan Cömert, were attacked in February 2014 by unknown assailants. The journalist Mithat Fabian Sözmen had to seek medical care after a physical attack in March 2014. = Arrests of journalists = Despite the 2004 Press Law foresees only fines, other restrictive laws have led to several journalists and writers being put behind bars. According to a report published by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least seven journalists remained in prison by the end of 2014. The independent Turkish press agency Bianet counted 22 journalists and 10 publishers in jail - most of them Kurds, charged with association with an illegal organisation. In 2016, Turkey became the biggest jail for journalists. As to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) rank, Turkey was the first country ever to jail 81 journalists, editors and media practitioners in one year. According to a CPJ report, Turkish authorities are engaging in widespread criminal prosecution and jailing of journalists, and are applying other forms of severe pressure to promote self-censorship in the press. The CPJ has found highly repressive laws, particularly in the penal code and anti- terror law; a criminal procedure code that greatly favors the state; and a harsh anti-press tone set at the highest levels of government. Turkey's press freedom situation has reached a crisis point.Committee to Protect Journalists Turkey's Press Freedom Crisis. Retrieved on October 22, 2012 This reports mentions 3 types of journalists targeted : * investigative and critical reporters : victims of the anti-state prosecutions : The government's broad inquiry into the Ergenekon plot ensnared investigative reporters. But the evidence, rather than revealing conspirators, points to a government intent on punishing critical reporters. * Kurdish journalists : Turkish authorities conflate support for the Kurdish cause with terrorism itself. When it comes to Kurdish journalists, newsgathering activities such as fielding tips, covering protests, and conducting interviews are evidence of a crime. * collateral damages of the general assault on the press : The authorities are waging one of the world's biggest anti-press campaigns in recent history. Dozens of writers and editors are in prison, nearly all on terrorism or other anti-state charges. Kemalist and / or nationalist journalists were arrested on charges referring to the Ergenekon case and several left-wing and Kurdish journalists were arrested on charges of engaging in propaganda for the PKK listed as a terrorist organization. In short, writing an article or making a speech can still lead to a court case and a long prison sentence for membership or leadership of a terrorist organisation. Together with possible pressure on the press by state officials and possible firing of critical journalists, this situation can lead to a widespread self-censorship.The European Commission Turkey Progress Report 2012. Retrieved on 11 October 2012 In November 2013, three journalists were sentenced to life in prison as senior members of the illegal Marxist–Leninist Communist Party - among them the founder of Özgür Radio, Füsun Erdoğan. They had been arrested in 2006 and held until 2014, when they were released following legal reforms on pre-trial detention terms. An appeal is still pending. In February 2017, German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yücel was jailed in Istanbul. On April 10, 2017, the Italian journalist Gabriele Del Grande was arrested in Hatay and jailed in Mugla. He was in Turkey in order to write a book on the war in Syria. He went on hunger strike on April 18, 2017. = Judicial prosecution = Defamation and libel remain criminal charges in Turkey. They often result in fines and jail terms. Bianet counted 10 journalists convicted of defamation, blasphemy or incitement to hatred in 2014. Courts' activities on media-related cases, particularly those concerning the corruption scandals surrounding Erdoğan and his close circle, have cast doubts on the independence and impartiality of the judiciary in Turkey. The Turkish Journalists' Association and the Turkish Journalists' Union counted 60 new journalists under prosecution for this single issue in 2013, for a total number of over 100 lawsuits. * In January 2009 Adnan Demir, editor of the provocative newspaper Taraf, was charged with divulging secret military information, under Article 336 of the Turkish Criminal Code.Reporters Without Borders, Editor of Taraf facing up to five years in prison, 7 January 2009 He was accused of having published an article in October 2008 that alleged police and military had been warned of an imminent PKK attack that same month, an attack which resulted in the death of 13 soldiers. Demir faces up to 5 years of prison. On 29 December 2009 İstanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 13 acquitted Adnan Demir.The Democratic Turkey Forum quoting an article in the daily Zaman of 29 December 2009 * In February 2014, author İhsan Eliaçık was condemned for defamation, after being sued by the Presidency for comments on Twitter during the Gezi Park protests of 2013. * In April 2014 the columnist Önder Aytaç was condemned to 10 months in jail for “insulting public officials” for a tweet about Erdoğan. Aytaç claimed the tweet included a typo. * The Cumhuriyet columnist Can Dündar was sued for defamation by Erdoğan in May 2014 for an article he had written in April. He received CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 2016. * In August 2014, the Taraf columnist Mehmet Baransu was briefly arrested for defamation after criticizing the authorities, and faced the risk of a long jail sentence in a separate case for allegedly publishing documents concerning a classified meeting in 2004. * In September 2014 the writer, journalist, and publisher Erol Özkoray was condemned to 11 months and 20 days (with suspended sentence) for defamation against Erdoğan in a book he had authored about the Gezi Park protests. = Denial of accreditation and deportation of foreign journalists = * In January 2014 the Azerbaijani journalist Mahir Zeynalov was deported after being sued by the President for posting links on Twitter to articles on a corruption scandal. * In September 2015, Turkey deported three foreign journalists in Diyarbakır, who were reporting on Turkey's Kurdish issue. Two British Vice News journalists, reporter Jake Hanrahan and photojournalist Philip Pendlebury, were detained on 27 August and then deported on 2 September. Mohammed Ismael Rasool, a Turkish citizen who was with the British team as a fixer, was detained, questioned and faced further legal repercussions. They were reporting on the Turkish government's conflict with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). * One week later, Dutch journalist Fréderike Geerdink, who was known for being the only foreign reporter based in Diyarbakır and focusing on Kurdish issues, was deported by Turkish authorities following her second arrest in 2015. Geerdink, a freelance reporter whose contributions appeared regularly in Dikan, had written a book about the Turkish strike that resulted in the Roboski massacre of Kurds, which was published in 2014 but released in English in 2015. * Rauf Mirkadirov, Azerbaijani correspondent from Ankara for Ayna and Zerkalo, was extradited to Azerbaijan without access to a lawyer. He was then charged with espionage by the Azerbaijani authorities. Mirkadirov had written accounts that were critical of both governments. = Hostile public rhetoric and smear campaigns = Particularly since 2013, the President Erdoğan and other governmental officials have resorted to hostile public rhetoric against independent journalists and media outlets, which is then echoed in the pro-governmental press and TV, accusing foreign media and interest groups of conspiring to bring down his government. * The Economist correspondent, Amberin Zaman, was publicly denounced as a \\"shameless militant\\" by Erdoğan at a pre-electoral rally in August 2014. Erdoğan tried to intimidate her by telling her to \\"know [her] place\\". She was then subjected to a deluge of abuse and threats on social media by AKP supporters in the following months. * In September 2014 The New York Times reporter Ceylan Yeğinsu was publicly smeared and depicted as a traitor for a photograph caption in a reportage on ISIS recruitment in Turkey. The U.S. State Department criticized Turkey for such intimidation attempts. = Arbitrary denial of access = Tukish authorities have been reported as denying access to events and information to journalists for political reasons. * In December 2013, after the press had unveiled an alleged corruption scandal involving top government officials, the police department announced the closure of two press rooms in Istanbul and declared that journalists would not be allowed to enter police facilities unless strictly for formal press conferences. * 2014 saw a worsening of discriminatory accreditation policies. AKP meetings were off-limits for critical journalists. In case of visits abroad, foreign officials had to hold separate press conferences to allow unaccredited media correspondents.  Government control over the media  Since 2011, the AKP government has increased restrictions on freedom of speech, freedom of the press and internet use, and television content, as well as the right to free assembly. It has also developed links with media groups, and used administrative and legal measures (including, in one case, a billion tax fine) against critical media groups and critical journalists: \\"over the last decade the AKP has built an informal, powerful, coalition of party-affiliated businessmen and media outlets whose livelihoods depend on the political order that Erdogan is constructing. Those who resist do so at their own risk.\\" These behaviours became particularly prominent in 2013 in the context of the Turkish media coverage of the Gezi Park protests. The BBC noted that while some outlets are aligned with the AKP or are personally close to Erdogan, \\"most mainstream media outlets - such as TV news channels HaberTurk and NTV, and the major centrist daily Milliyet - are loth to irritate the government because their owners' business interests at times rely on government support. All of these have tended to steer clear of covering the demonstrations.\\" Few channels provided live coverage – one that did was Halk TV. Several private media outlets were reported as engaging in self-censorship due to political pressures. The 2014 local and presidential elections exposed the extent of biased coverage by progovernment media. = Direct control over state media = The state-run Anadolu Agency and the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) have also been criticized by media outlets and opposition parties, for acting more and more like a mouthpiece for the ruling AKP, a stance in stark violation of their requirement as public institutions to report and serve the public in an objective way. In 2014 the TRT, the state broadcaster, as well as the state- owned Anadolu Agency, were subject to stricter controls. Even RTÜK warned TRT for disproportionate coverage of the AKP; the Supreme Board of Elections fined the public broadcaster for not reporting at all on presidential candidates other than Erdoğan, between August 6 and 8. The Council of Europe observers reported concern about the unfair media advantage for the incumbent ruling party. = Pro-governmental \\"Pool Media\\" = During its 12-year rule, the ruling AKP has gradually expanded its control over media. Today, numerous newspapers, TV channels and internet portals also dubbed as Yandaş Medya (\\"Partisan Media\\") or Havuz Medyası (\\"Pool Media\\") continue their heavy pro- government propaganda. Several media groups receive preferential treatment in exchange for AKP-friendly editorial policies. Some of these media organizations were acquired by AKP-friendly businesses through questionable funds and processes. Leaked telephone calls between high ranking AKP officials and businessmen indicate that government officials collected money from businessmen in order to create a \\"pool media\\" that will support AKP government at any cost. Arbitrary tax penalties are assessed to force newspapers into bankruptcy—after which they emerge, owned by friends of the president. According to a recent investigation by Bloomberg, Erdogan forced a sale of the once independent daily Sabah to a consortium of businessmen led by his son-in- law. Leading pro-AKP newspapers are Yeni Şafak, Akit, Sabah, Star, Takvim, Akşam, Türkiye, Millî Gazete, Güneş, and Milat, among others. Leading pro-AKP TV channels are Kanal 7, 24, Ülke TV, TRT, ATV and A haber, TGRT, Sky Turk 360, TV Net, NTV, TV8, Beyaz TV, Kanaltürk, and Kanal A. Leading pro- government internet portals are Haber 7, Habervaktim and En Son Haber. Leading pro-AKP news agencies are state owned Anadolu Agency and İhlas News Agency. = Direct pressures and self-censorship of major media outlets = Major media outlets in Turkey belong to certain group of influential businessman or holdings. In nearly all cases, these holding companies earn only a small fraction of their revenue from their media outlets, with the bulk of profits coming from other interests, such as construction, mining, finance, or energy. Therefore, media groups usually practice self-censorship to protect their wider business interests. Media not friendly to the AKP are threatened with intimidation, inspections and fines. These media group owners face similar threats to their other businesses. An increasing number of columnists have been fired for criticizing the AKP leadership. In addition to the censorship practiced by pro-government media such as Sabah, Yeni Şafak, and Star, the majority of other newspapers, such as Sözcü, Zaman, Milliyet, and Radikal have been reported as practicing self-censorship to protect their business interests and using the market share (65% of the total newspapers sold daily in Turkey as opposed to pro-government media) to avoid retaliatory action by the AKP government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. During the period before the Turkish local elections of 2014, a number of phone calls between prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and media executives were leaked to the internet. Most of the recordings were between Edoğan and Habertürk newspaper & TV channel executive Fatih Saraç. In those recordings, it can be heard that Erdoğan was calling Fatih Saraç when he was unhappy about a news item published in the newspaper or broadcast on TV. He was demanding Fatih Saraç to be careful next time or censor any particular topics he is not happy about. At another leaked call, Erdoğan gets very upset and angry over a news published at Milliyet newspaper and reacts harshly to Erdoğan Demirören, owner of the newspaper. Later, it can be heard that Demirören is reduced to tears. During a call between Erdoğan and editor-in-chief of Star daily Mustafa Karaalioğlu, Erdoğan lashes out at Karaalioğlu for allowing Mehmet Altan to continue writing such critical opinions about a speech the prime minister had delivered recently. In the second conversation, Erdoğan is heard grilling Karaalioğlu over his insistence on keeping Hidayet Şefkatli Tuksal, a female columnist in the paper despite her critical expressions about him. Later, both Altan and Tuksal got fired from Star newspaper. Erdoğan acknowledged that he called media executives. In 2014, direct pressures from the executive and the Presidency have led to the dismissal of media workers for their critical articles. Bianet records over 339 journalists and media workers being laid off or forced to quit in the year - several of them due to political pressures. *In August 2014 Enis Berberoğlu, the editor-in-chief of Hürriyet newspaper, quit the paper right before the 2014 Turkish presidential election. It has been reported that he was forced to resign after a clash with the publishing company Doğan Holding, due to Berberoğlu's refusal to fire a columnist. The day before, Erdoğan had publicly criticized the Doğan group. Hürriyet denied pressures related to the case. = Prosecution of journalists and closure of media = * The headquarters of Nokta, an investigative magazine which has since been closed because of military pressures, were searched by police in April 2007, following the publication of articles examining alleged links between the Office of the Chief of Staff and some NGOs, and questioning the military's connection to officially civilian anti-government rallies.Turkey: Human Rights Concerns in the Lead up to July Parliamentary Elections ; The Implications for Human Rights of Military Influence in the Political Arena, Human Rights Watch, July 2007Nokta magazine raided by police, Turkish Daily News, April 14, 2007 The magazine also gave details on military blacklistings of journalists, as well as two plans for a military coup, by retired generals, aiming to overthrow the AKP government in 2004.Magazine that revealed ‘coups’ ends publication , Today's Zaman, 21 April 2007 Nokta had also revealed military accreditations for press organs, deciding to whom the military should provide information.E. Bariş Altintaş, Ercan Yavuz, New military media scandal exposed , Today's Zaman, 9 March 2007Alper Görmüş, editor of Nokta, was charged with insult and libel (under articles 267 and 125 of the Turkish Penal Code, TPC), and faced a possible prison sentence of over six years, for publishing the excerpts of the alleged journal of Naval Commander Örnek in the magazine's March 29, 2007 issue. Nokta journalist Ahmet Şık and defense expert journalist Lale Sarıibrahimoğlu were also indicted on May 7, 2007 under Article 301 for \\"insulting the armed forces\\" in connection with an interview Şık conducted with Sarıibrahimoğlu. * Prosecution of media workers suspected to be linked with the Group of Communities in Kurdistan, alleged urban branch of the PKK, led to over 46 journalists being arrested as allegedly part of the \\"press wing\\" of the group in 2011. Most of them were released pending the trial under antiterrorism laws. Among them were the owner of Belge Publishing House, Ragıp Zarakolu, and his son Deniz, editor at Belge. Ragıp was released in April 2012, and Deniz in March 2014, both pending trial. * The Committee To Protect Journalists reported that in 2012 Turkey had more journalists in custody than any other country in the world. * In 2013 the opposition in Turkey claimed that dozens of journalists had been forced from their jobs for covering antigovernment protests. * In 2014 media outlets were raided and journalists jailed in connection with the governmental crackdown on the Gülen movement, a former ally of Erdogan, now disgraced. On 14 December 2014 authorities searched the premises of the Zaman newspaper and arrested several media workers, including the editor in chief Ekrem Dumanlı, as well as Hidayet Karaca, general manager of the Samanyolu Media Group, and charged them with “establishing and managing an armed terror organization” to reverse state power. Most journalists were released in the following days, pending trial. * In November 2015 Can Dündar, editor of the prominent secularist Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet, and Erdem Gül, the newspaper's capital correspondent in Ankara, were jailed facing life in prison. The prosecution stemmed from an article published with the headline \\"Here are the weapons Erdoğan claims to not exist‟ on May 29, 2015. The images were showing MIT (Millî İstihbarat Teşkilâtı, the Turkish National Intelligence Agency) tracks sending weapons to Syria. They were arrested for “Procuring information as to state security‟, \\"Political and military espionage‟, \\"Declaring confidential information‟ and \\"Propagandizing a terror organization‟. They were released on February 26, 2016 after the Turkish Constitutional Court ruled that their rights were violated during the pre-trial detention; the imprisonment lasted 92 days. On May 6, 2016, Istanbul's 14th Court for Serious Crimes convicted both Dündar and Gül for revealing state secrets that posed a threat to state security or to Turkey's domestic or foreign interests. Dündar was sentenced to seven years in prison, reduced to five years and 10 months; and Gül to six years, reduced to five, under Article 329 of the Turkish Penal Code. * Reporters Without Borders said the arrests sent “an extremely grave signal about media freedom in Turkey.” This crackdown on the press, which has reached new levels in March 2016 with the seizure of opposition newspaper Zaman, one of Turkey's leading media outlets, has sparked widespread criticism inside Turkey as well as internationally. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has declared that Press freedom in Turkey is \\"under siege\\". Jodie Ginsberg, the CEO of Index on Censorship, a campaigning organisation for freedom of expression, has declared that \\"Turkey’s assault on press freedom is the act of a dictatorship, not a democracy\\". * In the course of the 2016 Turkish purges, the licenses of 24 radio and television channels and the press cards of 34 journalists accused of being linked to Gülen were revoked. Two people were arrested for praising the coup attempt and insulting President Erdoğan on social media. On 25 July, Nazlı Ilıcak was taken into custody. * On 27 July 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan shut down 16 television channels, 23 radio stations, 45 daily newspapers, 15 magazines and 29 publishing houses in another emergency decree under the newly adopted emergency legislation. The closed outlets notably include Gülen-affiliated Cihan News Agency, Samanyolu TV and the previously leading newspaper Zaman (including its English-language version Today's Zaman), but also the opposition daily newspaper Taraf which was known to be in close relations with the Gulen Movement. Since Zaman's seizure, the newspaper radically changed its editorial policy. * In late October 2016, Turkish authorities shut down 15 media outlets, including one of the world's only women's news agencies, and detained the editor-in-chief of the prominent secularist Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet, \\"on accusations that they committed crimes on behalf of Kurdish militants and a network linked to the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen\\". Koza İpek =Government seizure of independent media companies= * On 26 October 2015, just a few days before the November 1 general elections, Koza İpek Holding was placed under a panel of mainly pro-government trustees. The company's media assets include two daily newspapers, Bugün and Millet, and two TV/radio stations, and Kanaltürk TV. İpek Media Group was closed on 29 February 2016. * On 4 March 2016, the opposition newspaper Zaman was likewise placed under a panel of government- aligned trustees. On 8 March 2016, Cihan News Agency, which was also owned by Feza Publications, placed under trustees like Zaman. * As to January 18, 2017, more than 150 media outlets were closed and their assets liquidated by governmental decrees. Under emergency decree No. 687 of February 9, 2017, Turkey's Saving Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF) will be authorized to sell companies seized by the state through the appointment of trustees. Also, through the use of emergency decrees- such as Nos. 668 (July 27, 2016), 675 (October 29, 2016) and 677 (November 22, 2016), 178 media organizations were closed down being charged of having terrorist affiliations. As to November 2016, Twenty-four of these shut-down media organizations were radio stations, twenty- eight televisions, eighty newspapers. =Removing channels from government-controlled TV satellites= Türksat is the sole communications satellite operator in Turkey. There have been allegations that TV channels critical of the AKP party and President Erdoğan have been removed from Türksat's infrastructure, and that Türksat's executive board is dominated by pro-Erdoğan figures. In October 2015 a video recording emerged of a 2 February 2015 conversation between Mustafa Varank, advisor to President Erdoğan and board member of Türksat, and some journalists in which Varank states that he had urged Türksat to drop certain TV channels because \\"they are airing reports that harm the government's prestige\\". Later that year the TV channels Irmak TV, Bugün TV, and Kanaltürk, known for their critical stance against the government, were notified by Türksat that their contracts would not be renewed as of November 2015, and were told to remove their platforms from Türksat's infrastructure. Türksat dropped TV channels critical of the government from its platform in November 2015. The broadcasting of TV stations—including Samanyolu TV, Mehtap TV, S Haber and Radio Cihan—that are critical of the ruling AKP government were halted by Türksat because of a “legal obligation” to the order of a prosecutor's office, based on the suspicion that the channels support a terrorist organization. Among the TV and radio stations removed were Samanyolu Europe, Ebru TV, Mehtap TV, Samanyolu Haber, Irmak TV, Yumurcak TV, Dünya TV, MC TV, Samanyolu Africa, Tuna Shopping TV, Burç FM, Samanyolu Haber Radio, Mehtap Radio and Radio Cihan. The critical Bugün and Kanaltürk TV channels, which were seized by a government-initiated move in October 2015, were also dropped from Türksat in November 2015. Later on 1 March 2016 these two seized channels closed due to financial reasons by government trustees. In March 2016 the two TV channels from other wings of the politics were also removed from Türksat, namely, Turkish Nationalist Benguturk and Kurdish Nationalist IMC TV. On 25 September 2017, Turkey decided to remove broadcaster Rudaw, which is affiliated to the Kurdistan Region, from its satellite broadcasting on the same day voting took place on an independence referendum in the KRG.  Censorship of the media  Censorship of sensitive topics in Turkey happens both online and offline. Kurdish issues, the Armenian Genocide, as well as subjects controversial for Islam or the Turkish state are often censored. Enforcement remains arbitrary and unpredictable. Also, defamation of the Head of the State is a crime provision increasingly used for censoring critical voices in Turkey. In the 2018 Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index, Turkey is ranked in the 157th place out of 178 countries. The situation for free expression has always been troubled in Turkey. The situation dramatically deteriorated after the 2013 Gezi protests, reaching its peak after the July 15, 2016 coup attempt. From that moment on, a state of emergency is in force, tens of thousand of journalists, academics, public officials and intellectuals have been arrested or charged, mainly with terrorist charges, sometimes following some statement or writing of them. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights' report on freedom of expression and media freedom in Turkey, after his 2016 visits to Turkey, noted that the violations to freedom of expression in Turkey have created a distinct chilling effect, manifesting in self- censorship both among the remaining media and among ordinary citizens. In addition, the Commissioner wrote that the main obstacle to an improvement of the situation of freedom of expression and media freedom in Turkey is the lack of political will both to acknowledge and to address such problems. = Reporting bans and gag orders = In 2017, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights noted that with regard to judicial harassment restricting freedom of expression the main issues consist in: * Backsliding in the case-law of the Turkish judiciary; * Issues related to the independence of the judiciary and of the judicial culture; * Defamation remains a criminal offence and causes dangerous chilling effects, in particular defamation of the President of the Republic and of public officials; * Harassment restricted the parliamentary debate, after the lift of the immunity of parliamentarians. Most of the opposition HD Party MPs are under investigations, if not in prison; * Great restrictions of academic freedoms: many academics were dismissed, forced to resign, suspended or taken into police custody; * Harassment involves all sectors of Turkish society, e.g. human rights defenders. There are frequent impositions of media bans or blackouts concerning events of clear public interest and an excessive use of detention on remand. As to January 18, 2017, more than 150 media outlets were closed and their assets liquidated by governmental decrees. Under emergency decree No. 687 of February 9, 2017, Turkey's Saving Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF) will be authorized to sell companies seized by the state through the appointment of trustees. Also, through the use of emergency decrees- such as Nos. 668 (July 27, 2016), 675 (October 29, 2016) and 677 (November 22, 2016), 178 media organizations were closed down being charged of having terrorist affiliations. As to November 2016, Twenty-four of these shut-down media organizations were radio stations, twenty- eight televisions, eighty newspapers. In 2014, Turkish regulators issued several reporting bans on public interest issues. * In February 2014 it was forbidden to report on allegations of MİT involvement in the transfer of weapons to Syria. * In March 2014 leaked audio recordings of a national security meeting at the Foreign Ministry were put under gag order. * In May 2014 the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) warned broadcasters to refrain from showing materials deemed “disrespectful to feelings of the families of victims” after the Soma mine disaster. The country worst mining disaster, causing 301 deaths, remained absent from most mainstream media outlets. * In June 2014 a reporting ban was issued concerning the kidnapping by ISIL of 49 Turkish citizens from the Turkish consulate in Mosul, Iraq. * In November 2014 a court in Ankara issued an unprecedented reporting ban on a parliamentary inquiry into corruption allegations concerning four former ministers. * In September 2014 the premises of the online newspapers Gri Hat and Karşı Gazete were raided and searched by police after they had published information on the alleged corruption scandal. The police demanded the removal of online information, despite only having a search warrant. In 2012, as part of the Third Reform Package, all previous bans on publications were cancelled unless renewed by court - which happened for most leftist and Kurdish publications. Academics are also affected by government's censorship. In this regard, the case of the Academics for Peace is particularly relevant: on January 14, 2016, 27 academics were detained for interrogations after having signed a petition with more than other 1.000 people asking for Peace in the South- East of the country, where there are ongoing violent clashes between the Turkish Army and the PKK. = Broadcasting = In television broadcasts, scenes displaying nudity, consumption of alcohol, smoking, drug usage and violence are commonly censored by blurring out respective areas. TV channels also practice self-censorship of subtitles in order to avoid heavy fines from the Radio and Television Supreme Council (Radyo ve Televizyon Üst Kurulu, RTÜK). For example, CNBC-e channel usually translates the word “gay” as “marginal“. State agency RTÜK continues to impose a large number of closure orders on TV and radio stations on the grounds that they have made separatist broadcasts. * In 2000, television channels were instructed that they would be suspended for a day if they aired the music video for ‘Kuşu Kalkmaz’, a single from Sultana's debut album ‘Çerkez Kızı’. * In August 2001, RTÜK banned the BBC World Service and the Deutsche Welle on the grounds that their broadcasts \\"threatened national security.\\" A ban on broadcasting in Kurdish was lifted with certain qualifications in 2001 and 2002.Defiance Under Fire: Leyla Zana: Prisoner of Conscience , Amnesty International, Fall 2003 * Early in 2007, the Turkish government banned a popular television series called Valley of the Wolves: Terror, citing the show's violent themes. The TV show inspired a Turkish-made movie by the same name, which included American actor Gary Busey. Busey played an American doctor who removed organs from Iraqi prisoners at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison and sold the harvested organs on the black market. The movie was pulled from theaters in the United States after the Anti-Defamation League complained to the Turkish ambassador to the U.S. about the movie's portrayal of Jews.\\"First Banned in U.S., 'Wolves' Now Banned in Turkey\\" , Banned Magazine, February 17, 2007 * In 2013, a private television channel fined $30,000 for insulting religious values over an episode of \\"The Simpsons\\" in which God was shown taking orders from the devil. * In 2017, The Loud House was banned by the Turkish government due to Luna Loud being a Lesbian. This happened after L Is for Love. The website still has services to stream. = Print = * Özgür Gündem case (1993- 2016): Özgür Gündem is a pro-Kurdish and leftist media outlet based in Istanbul. From the beginning of the ‘90’s, the newspaper has been subject to raids and legal actions, with many journalists being arrested and even killed. The paper remained closed from 1994 to 2011 due to a court order. These facts were the bases for the Özgür Gündem v. Turkey case before the ECtHR. On August 16, 2016, there was another raid by Turkish police inside the newspaper and a court ordered its interim closure for \\"continuously making propaganda for Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)\\" and \\"acting as if it is a publication of the armed terror organisation\\". Twenty-four Gündem's journalists were arrested and kept in precautionary detention. Only considering July 2016, the Özgür Gündem's website was blocked twice, first on the 1st and then on the 26th.  Censorship of works of art  * Michael Dickinson collage case (2006): In June 2006, police seized a collage by British artist Michael Dickinson -- which showed the then Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as a dog being given a rosette by President Bush -- and told him he would be prosecuted. Charles Thomson, leader of the Stuckism movement, of which Dickinson is a member, wrote to then UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair in protest. The Times commented: \\"The case could greatly embarrass Turkey and Britain, for it raises questions about Turkey’s human rights record as it seeks EU membership, with Tony Blair’s backing.\\"Alberge, Dalya and Erdem, Suna (2006).

In the advertisements they used sentences such as \\"Am I a sheep?\\" \\"Am I bird-brained?\\" (Common insults in Turkish). * In 2016, the director of the Dresdner Sinfoniker orchestra claimed Turkey's delegation to the European Union demanded the European Commission withdraw 200,000 euros in funding for a concert which will use the term “genocide” in texts sung and spoken during a planned show. * Zehra Doğan case: On March 6, 2017, Zehra Doğan was sentenced to 2 years and 9 months of detention for “separatist propaganda”, following a drawing of her shared on Twitter representing the Nusaybin curfew, in the South- East of Turkey. * Before the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum which would authorise changes to the Turkish constitution to increase the power of the president, a Turkish court banned a pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) song which supported the \\"No\\" on the grounds that it contravened the constitution and fomented hatred. * In 2018, Turkey's top media watchdog, the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK), reviewed the English-language lyrics of pop songs, and issued fines after concluding that they were inappropriate. RTÜK issued a 17,065 Turkish Lira fine to the music channels NR1 and Dream TV due to the lyrics of ‘Wild Thoughts’ and the same amount of fine to Power TV due to the lyrics of ‘Sex, Love & Water’.  Censorship of films, movies and theater plays  * The Sex and the City 2 film, was banned from Turkish cable television because authorities saw the representation of gay marriage as “twisted and immoral” and deemed dangerous to the Turkish family. * In 2011, established the platform Siyah Bant (Black Bar) to research and document cases of censorship in the arts in Turkey and to defend artistic freedom of expression. * In 2014, the film Yeryüzü Aşkın Yüzü Oluncaya Dek (Until the Face of the Earth Becomes a Face of Love) was removed from the programme of the International Antalya Film Festival by festival organisers after a warning that showing the film may commit the crime of insulting Turkey's President. * In 2015, the Istanbul film festival cancelled the screening of the film North (original title: Bakur) after the Turkish ministry of culture complained. The film showed a footage of a few members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party. * In 2016, the Ankara International Film Festival, which did not require registration documents for films before 2015, requested this document from all the producers of films that passed the pre-screening to be added to the programme. Two directors who said that registration documents were being used as a form of censorship and, for this reason, they would not get them, had their films removed from the programme. * In April 2017, the futuristic satire short film called \\"The Last Schnitze\\" banned from the International Istanbul Film Festival because the filmmakers refused to comply with the Turkish ministry. * In 2017, the Ankara Governor's Office banned the Germany's embassy LGBT Film Festival. * On 17 November 2017 - The governor's office of Ankara has banned all the public showing of all films, exhibitions and events related to LGBT, citing \\"public sensitivities.\\" * In 2018, the Adana State Theater's play “India Bank,” which was on a tour in the province of Batman, was removed from the stage because of an intervention by Batman provincial Culture and Tourism Directorate officials. The theater play was removed from the stage after two of its scenes were deemed “obscene.” * In 2018, the Ankara Governor's Office has banned the LGBT-related film “Pride”, citing the ongoing state of emergency in the country as a reason for the ban. The office said such events can “incite hatred and enmity” among different factions of the society, from which “danger” can arise. * In 2020, investigations were started by the Presidential Communication Center regarding a potentially homosexual character in the Netflix original series Love 101 and a case was opened in court against it. The court eventually dismissed the case as the claims could not be proven. * In June 2020, negotiations between Netflix and members of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party over the issue of including LGBT characters failed. Turkey had demanded that a gay character be removed entirely from the script prepared for a series. Netflix refused to accept this demand and the production of the show was stopped. * In September 2020, the Turkish Radio and Television High Council (RTÜK) decided that the Netflix should remove the movie Cuties. Before the decision the Turkey’s Family, Labor and Social Services Ministry called the RTÜK to take necessary precautions about the movie.

Internet censorship  Turkey's Internet censorship regime shifted from \\"moderate\\" to \\"severe\\" in late 2016 following a series of social media shutdowns, regional Internet blackouts and restrictions on VPN and Tor circumvention tools documented by independent digital rights watchdog Turkey Blocks. Months earlier, human rights research group Freedom House had already downgraded its outlook of internet freedom in the country to \\"Not Free,\\" noting in its report that the assessment was made before further restrictions following the abortive military coup in July. With regard to Internet censorship, in the 2017 Report on media freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe found out: * the increase of blocking and filtering of web pages; * an increased practice of resorting to bandwidth throttling during times of domestic crises, making certain social media and platforms inaccessible.; * cases of full internet shutdowns; * Increase of prosecutions and detentions for online activities causing a great chilling effect (a.k.a. self-censorship). In earlier years, the Turkish government implemented legal and institutional reforms driven by the country's ambitions to become a European Union member state. At the same time Turkey demonstrated its high sensitivity to defamation and other \\"inappropriate\\" online content, resulting in the closure of a number of local and international Web sites. All Internet traffic passes through Türk Telekom’s infrastructure, allowing centralized control over online content and facilitating the implementation of shutdown decisions. In December 2010 the OpenNet Initiative, a non-partisan organization based in Canada and the United States that investigates, analyzes, and exposes Internet filtering and surveillance practices, classified Internet censorship in Turkey as selective (third lowest of four classifications) in the political, social, and Internet tools areas and found no evidence of censorship in the conflict/security area.\\"ONI Country Profile: Turkey\\", OpenNet Initiative, 18 December 2010 However, also in 2010, Reporters Without Borders added Turkey to its list of 16 countries \\"under surveillance\\" (the less serious of two Internet censorship lists that it maintains), saying: In July 2010 the Alternative Informatics Association organized one of the first and largest street protests against Internet censorship in Istanbul. A second protest took place in May 2011 with demonstrations in 30 cities in Turkey.\\"Turkish protesters search for unrestricted Internet, blocked by judiciary\\", Hurriyet Daily News, 18 July 2010. Retrieved 22 June 2014. In its Freedom on the Net 2016 report, Freedom House gave Turkey a \\"freedom on the net status\\" of \\"not free\\" saying that: * Mobile and internet connections were repeatedly suspended in Yuksekova, Cizre, Sur, Silopi, and other cities in the southeast of the country during raids by security agencies against militants ;Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube were temporarily blocked on numerous occasions—typically in the aftermath of terrorist attacks—until they restricted access to specific posts or accounts; * Turkey accounted for almost 90 percent of all content that was locally restricted by Twitter in the second half of 2015. Turkey's regulator fined the company TRY 150,000 (US$51,000) for refusing to remove what it termed “terrorist propaganda” from the site ; * Pro-government trolls have escalated their campaigns to harass opposition voices and organizations on social media through smear campaigns and fake accounts ; * Journalists such as Hayri Tunç, Aytekin Gezici, and Bülent Keneş received lengthy prison sentences for “insulting” public officials or spreading “terrorism propaganda” ; * A 14-day cyberattack brought almost 400,000 Turkish websites offline and temporarily suspended retail banking services in the country. The Freedom on the Net 2015 report, tracked that over 60,000 websites remain blocked in Turkey, and that TIB blocked 22,645 websites without prior court order only in 2014. Twitter was blocked for two weeks and YouTube for two months in 2014.\\"Turkey country report\\", Freedom on the Net 2015, Freedom House, 2015. Retrieved 06 December 2015. On March 21, 2014, Twitter access for Turkish users was blocked for two weeks in the run-up to local elections to prevent a stream of leaked wiretapped recordings of senior officials that had appeared on the site, prompting Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to declare he would \\"root out\\" the network.. In the 11th biannual transparency report published on September 19, 2017, Twitter said that Turkey was the first among countries where about 90 percent of removal requests came from. Also, Turkey has submitted the highest volume of removal requests to Twitter in 2014, 2015 ...Turkey accounted for more than half of all content removal requests sent to Twitter during the second half of 2016, a ranking it has topped for three years. and 2016. During the 2016–17 purges, the secure instant messaging app ByLock was accused by the Turkish government of being used primarily by members of the Gülen movement, which it classifies as a terrorist organization, during the failed coup. The government launched investigations of over 23,000 citizens for connections to Gülen, based solely on evidence that they had downloaded or used ByLock. Some of these investigations resulted in arrests and detainment. However, in December 2017, the government announced that it would investigate 11,480 phone numbers had been falsely accused of ties to ByLock and Gülen, after finding that the accusations were induced by unrelated apps embedding a web beacon pointing to the ByLock website from within. An arrest warrant was also issued against the developer of one of these apps. According to the decision published in the T.C. Resmî Gazete on 1 August 2019, online media service providers such as Netflix, BluTV and Puhutv, which broadcast series on the Internet, came under the control of RTÜK. Following this decision, digital broadcasting platforms were obliged to obtain a broadcast license to continue broadcasting. With the decision, the RTÜK administration specified that the violation of the rules of broadcasting could result in sanctions for the broadcasters. On 1 July 2020, in a statement made to his party members, Erdoğan announced that the government would introduce new measures and regulations to control or shut down social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter and Netflix. Through these new measures, each company would be required to appoint an official representative in the country to respond to legal concerns. The decision comes after a number of Twitter users insulted his daughter Esra after she welcomed her fourth child. = Legal framework = Internet Law No. 5651 was enacted in 2007 Turkey with the declared objective of protecting families and minors. The way for its enactment was paved after the ban imposed on Youtube.com in 2007, because of a video insulting the Turkish Republic's founder Kemal Atatürk. Since then, such law was enforced in a restrictive manner, often causing episodes of censorship against common citizens, journalists and media outlets. For this reason, experts consider Law No. 5651 particularly controversial. On 5 February 2014 the Turkish Parliament adopted a controversial bill amending the Internet regulation in Turkey. It allows the telecommunications authority (TIB) to block any website within 4 hours without first seeking a court ruling, and requires Internet providers to store all data on web users' activities for two years and make it available to the authorities upon request.\\"Turkey pushes through new raft of 'draconian' internet restrictions\\", Constanze Letsch, The Guardian, 6 February 2014. Retrieved 7 February 2014. After the July 15, 2016 coup attempt, TIB’S power were transferred to the Technology and Communications Authority (Information and Communication Technologies Authority– BTK), which previously oversaw the TIB's operations. Internet Law No. 5651 prohibits: * crimes against Atatürk (Article 8/b), * offering or promoting prostitution, * providing place and opportunity for gambling, * unauthorized online gambling and betting, * sexual abuse of children, * encouraging suicide, * supplying drugs that are dangerous for health, and * facilitation of the abuse of drugs. Web sites are also blocked for the following reasons: * downloading of MP3 and movies in violation of copyright laws, * insults against state organisations and private persons * crimes related to terrorism * violation of trademark regulations * unfair trade regulated under the Turkish Commercial Code * violation of Articles 24, 25, 26, and 28 of the Constitution (freedoms of religion, expression, thought, and freedom of press). Since the 2015 amendments, national security is also a basis for broad access bans. Decisions to block a website can be appealed, but usually only after a site has been blocked. Nevertheless, due to the public profile of the major websites banned and the lack of juridical, technical, or ethical arguments to justify the censorship, the blocked sites are often available using proxies or by changing DNS servers. In September 2017, Turkey's Supreme Court has ruled that having ByLock, mobile messaging application, installed on phone is enough evidence to convict a suspect as a member of FETÖ.[ByLock can be considered sole evidence of Gülen network membership: Supreme Court http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/bylock-can-be-considered-sole-evidence-of- gulen-network-membership-supreme-court--118430] = Blocking of Internet sites = TİB stating the legal authority under which the particular website is blocked.

Some other cases of blocking of Internet sites are the following: * On 7 March 2007, Turkish courts imposed a ban on YouTube due to a speculative video that insulted Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Before the judgement, the court asked YouTube to remove the video completely, but they refused, saying they could only make it invisible for the Turkish people.Turkish court bans YouTube access, BBC News, 7 March 2007. The refusal made the matter a violation of article 8, dating back to 1951.

Civil society initiatives  Initiative for Freedom of Expression is an Istanbul- based association and movement of civil disobedience, working on the right to freedom of expression. It is a member of the global network IFEX. Since 2000, it publishes annual reports on the situation of freedom of expression in Turkey and distributes them among the main Non-Governmental Organizations, as well as to the media institutions. Every week, the Initiative publishes a Weekly Bulletin in Turkish and in English. Since 1997, it organizes biennial \\"Gatherings for Freedom of Expression\\" in Istanbul. Together with other stakeholders, it created the ÇTL database (Current Trial Library), recording thought crime cases. It opened a virtual and interactive Museum of the Crimes of Thought. Turkey Blocks monitors access to social media services and online mass-communication networks around Turkey's main population areas. It provides real time reporting of online incidents that may impact the safety, access to information and online business operations. Turkey Uncensored is an Index on Censorship project to publish articles from censored Turkish writers, artists and translators. Index on Censorship also curates the Mapping Media Freedom project - a database identifying threats, violations and limitations faced by members of the press throughout European Union member states, candidates for entry and neighbouring countries where threats on Turkish journalists and foreign journalists in Turkey are regularly monitored. The Platform for Independent Journalism (P24) is a timely initiative to support and promote editorial independence in the Turkish press at a time when the journalistic profession is under fierce commercial and political pressure. İfade Özgürlüğü Derneği (İFÖD - Freedom of Expression Association) published an annual report entitled Engelli Web, providing detailed information on Internet censorship and blocked websites from Turkey. The association also provides legal support to anyone facing criminal charges involving political speech.

It is also referred to sometimes in English as \\"Logganiko(s)\\" or \\"Longanico(s)\\". It is about 30 kilometers north of Sparta, the capital city of Lakonia, and is also very close to the cities of Kalamata, Tripolis and Megalopolis. It rests on the eastern slope of Mount Taigetos. The current population of Longanikos is 449 inhabitants according to the 2011 census. This figure includes the population of the surrounding smaller villages Vergadeika, Kiparrissi, Giakoumaiika, and Kotitsa. Because of the small size of this village, residents of this town often identify themselves as Spartans to other Greeks or foreigners. For those who are familiar with this area, a resident or person from Longanikos is referred to as a \\"Longanikiotes\\" (masc) or \\"Longanikiotissa\\" (fem).  Administration  The village is administered as part of the Pellana region of the Laconia (aka Lakonia) prefecture. The Pellana region's administrative central office is located in the village of Kastania (aka \\"Kastorion\\", \\"Kastori\\") which is about 15 miles south of Longanikos. [Note: Diaspora Greeks looking for documents related to any legal, property, or citizenship issues for themselves or their family should look here first for information and guidance. However, in 2011 some of the administrative functions, formerly processed in the Kastori prefectural office, were migrated to municipal offices in Sparta. One should inquire as to the exact location for the services you are trying to obtain] History Picture overlooking the fertile Evrotas valley from Logganikos The village changed location and name many times since the earliest record of its existence in Mycenaean times. The area of Longanikos has been identified with the ancient village of Velamini (Velmini), documented in ancient writings by Pausanias over 1800 years ago. The current name has been documented in writings as far back as Stefano Magno in 1453. It is believed that this area has been inhabited since Neolithic times, and much later served as a front- line military outpost for the powerful Spartan city-state. As a result of its geographical position between the 3 prefectures of Messinia, Arcadia and Laconia and because of the morphology of the ground where Taigetos and Parnonas converge without connecting, thereby creating the Laconian valley of Eurotas, Logganikos has served as a key transit point for the movement of people and armies in the Peloponese. It had also served as a military staging area and rampart for the state of Sparta. Today the village of Longanikos also includes the settlements of Vergadeika, Kiparissi, Giakoumeika and Foundeika. It is nestled along the green slopes and fir-covered mountain range of Mt. Taigetos and one can find stone houses, natural springs and fountains and forest roads that lead to the highest points of the mountain (Koutouni, Limna). Nearby one can also find some fountains that feed the Eurotas valley and the historical monasteries of Rekitsa and Ampelaki, close to the Arcadian border. Economy Most of industry in this area centers around olive cultivation, resulting in the production of olive oil as the main cash crop. The extra virgin olive oil that is produced is of the highest standards and quality and is sought out by olive oil importers globally. Most of the olive oil that is harvested is purchased by large Italian premium olive-oil labels who are known to repackage the local olive oil and brand it as an Italian product. The younger people are also shifting away from an agriculture-based economy as their primary source of income. As more and more residents drive, they have expanded their job opportunities to commuting to nearby larger cities such as Sparta or Megalopolis where they take public sector or private service and manufacturing jobs. During the turn of the 20th century and also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a huge outflow of residents to other major Greek cities, including Athens and Sparta, and also externally to the United States, Canada, Germany, South Africa, and Australia. This global diaspora of Longanikos emigrants still maintain strong ties with the village and during summer months the population swells with diaspora residents who have returned for summer holidays. In addition to its central location between Sparta and Tripoli, it is also only a 2.5 hour drive from central Athens and within driving distance of many famous sites, including Olympia, Monemvasia, Caves of Dirrou, Githeo, Kalamata, Corinth, the Argolid (Epidavros, Nafplion), amongst others. Details of Various Diaspora Communities of Longanikiotes Massachusetts, USA'' A high concentration of emigrants who went to the USA settled in the suburbs of Boston MA, primarily the towns of Lynn and Lowell, Massachusetts in the 60's and onwards, which historically have been gateway cities in Massachusetts for various immigrant groups from all over the world. In the beginning of the 20th century, Ipswich was also a gateway city. One of the most famous people with ties to Longanikos was Harry Agganis, also known as the \\"Golden Greek\\". Forest Fires 2007 During the devastating forest fires of 2007, the village was spared any damage. However, the fires came as close as five miles away from the northern direction and also there was extensive devastation on the opposite side of the mountain.

Taub ran numerous businesses and served on the boards of directors for several Texas organizations. He helped in the expansion and development of Houston entities such as the Texas Medical Center and the University of Houston. Ben Taub General Hospital, a large hospital in Houston, is named for him. Biography =Early life= His family were Jewish immigrants from the Austro-Hungarian empire and his father Jacob Nathan Taub moved to Texas in 1882. Ben Taub's family were poor and his father used to sell newspapers to make their living. Jacob Nathan later opened a tobacco store in downtown Houston. By the time Ben, their fourth child, was born they had become relatively comfortable. Taub grew up in Houston, where he attended Welch Preparatory School. During World War I, he was a captain and served in France. =Business career= He returned to Texas and expanded the family business, later becoming a real estate developer. He chaired and operated dozens of companies throughout his life, including director, chairman and senior chairman of the board, Texas Commerce Bank; chairman of the board, McGregor Park National Bank; and director, American General Insurance Company. At one time he served on 23 boards, including president and then chairman, DePelchin Faith Home for 15 years; president, Baylor Medical Foundation; trustee, Baylor College of Medicine; president, Taub Foundation; director, Child Welfare League of America; chairman, Board of Managers, Houston Tuberculosis Hospital; founding board member, TIRR; director and life director, Texas Medical Center; Trustee, St. Thomas University (Texas); 32° Mason, Master Mason, Awarded Fifty Year Masonic Grand Lodge Award; district director, Office of Price Administration (WWII); chairman, Community Chest, United Fund, which is now United Way, and many others. In 1936, Ben Taub donated thirty-five acres to establish a permanent campus for the University of Houston. He further persuaded the heirs of J.J. Settegast to donate seventy five acres to the campus. In 1943, he was instrumental in encouraging Baylor College of Medicine to move from Dallas to the Texas Medical Center in Houston. As chairman of the board of Jefferson Davis Hospital, he and Michael E. DeBakey made Jefferson Davis Hospital a teaching facility for Baylor College of Medicine, a relationship that continued after the creation of the Harris County Hospital District. Taub never married and spent his time visiting patients in the county hospital. For years he helped run the DePelchin Faith Home for homeless children. He worked with the Pauline Sterne Wolf Foundation. He also worked with Charlie Massey, Harris County Commissioner for Precinct 1, on charitable endeavors. During the Great Depression, he had a chauffeur driven automobile, reportedly a Pierce-Arrow. He was a director of the Texas Medical Center, headed the United Way, gave out scholarships, and sponsored visiting medical professors. He served as chairman of the Jefferson Davis Hospital from 1935 to 1964. =Later life= When Houston's new charity hospital opened in 1963 the hospital board, in recognition of his service, named it Ben Taub General Hospital. It became renowned as one of the nation's leading major trauma centers. Ben Taub died at age ninety-two on September 9, 1982. Baylor College of Medicine opened the Ben Taub Research Center in 1986. In 1990, the Harris County Hospital District opened the new, six-story, 500+ bed Ben Taub General Hospital.

Arms of the Pistohlkors family Alexander Erikovich Pistohlkors (June 6, 1885, Saint Petersburg - 1944) was a Russian Life Guards officer who was known for his cruelty in putting down the rebellion following the Russian Revolution of 1905.Radzinsky, Edvard, The Rasputin File, Doubleday, p. 218 Background and connections Pistohlkors was the son of Olga Valerianovna Karnovich by her first husband, Major general Erich Gerhard Augustinovich von Pistohlkors (1853–1935), from whom she was divorced before her second marriage in 1902. Through his mother's second marriage to Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia, he was a stepbrother of Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, one of the co-conspirators in the murder of Grigori Rasputin. His younger sister, Marianne, was also allegedly a co-conspirator in the murder.Radzinsky, pp. 476-477 Pistohlkors was the husband of Alexandra Taneyeva, a Rasputin follower and the sister of the Tsarina's lady in waiting, Anna Vyrubova. Exile Pistohlkors was a minor government official under Tsar Nicholas II's rule. Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia was the godmother for his eldest daughter, Tatiana. Pistohlkors and his wife also had two younger daughters, Olga and Alexandra. The Pistohlkors family fled to Finland in 1916 when the Russian political situation worsened, and he had estates in the Baltic countries. His daughter, Olga Ramel (1912–2011), later settled in Sweden.

Combination drugs with pyridoxine or cyanocobalamin are also marketed. Benfotiamine was developed and invented in Japan then reported internationally by Wada, Takagi, Minakami et al. in 1961. Uses Benfotiamine is primarily marketed as an over-the- counter drug to treat diabetic neuropathy; clinical trials results are mixed, finding it mildly useful or no different from placebo. Adverse effects There is little published data on adverse effects; in one study of a combination drug of benfotiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin, around 8% of people taking the drug experienced nausea, dizziness, stomach ache and weight gain, all of which are strongly associated with the common, normal aging process. Pharmacology Benfotiamine is more bioavailable than thiamine salts, providing higher levels of thiamine in muscle, brain, liver, and kidney. Benfotiamine is dephosphorylated to S-benzoylthiamine by ecto-alkaline phosphatases present in the intestinal mucosa, and is then hydrolyzed to thiamine by thioesterases in the liver. Benfotiamine mainly acts on peripheral tissues through an increase in transketolase activity. Chemistry Benfotiamine is a synthetic S-acyl Vitamin B1 analogue; its chemical name is S-benzoylthiamine O-monophosphate. Benfotiamin is a lipid derivative of thiamine vitamin. It has very low solubility in water or other aqueous solvents. Society and culture As of 2017, benfotiamine was marketed as a pharmaceutical drug in Argentina, Bosnia & Herzegowina, Bulgaria, Colombia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Russian Federation, Taiwan, and Vietnam under the following brand names: Benalgis, Benfogamma, Benforce, Benfotiamina, Biotamin, Biotowa, Milgamma, and Vilotram. It was also marketed in some jurisdictions as a combination drug with cyanocobalamin as Milgamma, in combination with pyridoxine as Milgamma, in combination with metformin as Benforce-M, and with thiamine as Vitafos. Research Benfotiamine has been studied in laboratory models of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. As of 2015 there had been one clinical study of benfotiamine in diabetic nephropathy. Administration of benfotiamine may increase intracellular levels of thiamine diphosphate, a cofactor of transketolase, and based on metabolic theories of Alzheimer's disease, it has been studied in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease.

The mission of IFSTA is to identify areas of need for training materials and to foster the development and validation of training materials for the fire service and related areas. IFSTA publishes such manuals as the Essentials of Fire Fighting, Fire and Emergency Services Instructor, Fire and Emergency Services Company Officer, Chief Officer, Building Construction Related to the Fire Service, Hazardous Materials for First Responders, and many others, in both print and eBook formats. Other training materials produced by IFSTA include curricula, study guides, videos, apps, and the ResourceOne course management system. IFSTA is governed by an Executive Board consisting of 12 elected members, 3 to 6 appointed members and an Executive Director. The officers of the Board include the Chair, Vice Chair, and Executive Director. IFSTA itself has no employees or funds of its own. IFSTA’s operational expenses are funded solely by Fire Protection Publications (FPP). The FPP offices are considered to be the official IFSTA headquarters. Fire Protection Publications is an outreach program of the College of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology (CEAT) a division in Oklahoma State University (OSU) in Stillwater. IFSTA's motto is \\"Written by firefighters, for firefighters.\\" The IFSTA Validation Conference The IFSTA Validation Conference is held each July. Committees of technical experts meet and work at the conference addressing the current standards of the National Fire Protection Association and other standards- making groups as they apply to IFSTA-validated manuals. These technical experts review all manual drafts and verify that the contents are valid. Committee members do not receive payment for participating and usually fund their own travel expenses to attend the July meeting. Active committees also meet at the IFSTA Winter Meeting that is held each January. Fire Protection Publications does fund the members travel to attend this meeting. The IFSTA Executive Board The Board has the sole policy-making authority for the Association so long as such policies do not conflict with the procedures of Oklahoma State University. Duties of the Board include establishing policies, establishing standing, ad hoc, manual validation committees, discontinuing projects, establishing new projects, approving scope and purpose statements, approving titles for new and revised training materials, advising Fire Protection Publications on pertinent matters, and maintaining external relations with other organizations. Twelve Board members are elected by the IFSTA Validation Conference delegates. Up to one third of the Board members may be appointed to the Board at the recommendation of the Executive Director and the Board Chair. Board members serve three-year terms. The Chair is elected by simple majority of the Board. The Chair presides over all Board and General Assembly meetings. It is also the duty of the Chair to appoint all standing and ad hoc committees. The Vice Chair is appointed by the Chair from the Board membership. The Vice Chair serves as chair of the Administrative Committee and the Delegate Selection Committee and assists with other duties as assigned by the Board. The Executive Director is an employee of Oklahoma State University who is approved by the Board. The Executive Director is empowered to act autonomously for the Executive Board in questions of policy that are of concern to the Association until such time as the Board can give those questions due consideration. The IFSTA Delegate Selection Committee The Delegate Selection Committee selects delegates for technical input. This committee consists of three Board members and two conference delegates; the committee is chaired by the Vice Chair of IFSTA. The committee reviews applications, and the delegates are selected based upon technical expertise and demographics. IFSTA Technical Committees Serving on an IFSTA technical committee is prestigious in the fire service community, and delegates are acknowledged leaders in their fields. This unique feature provides a close relationship between the International Fire Service Training Association and other fire protection agencies, which helps to correlate the efforts of all concerned. IFSTA technical committees meet and work at the conference addressing the current standards of the National Fire Protection Association and other standards-making groups as they apply to IFSTA-validated manuals. Committee members also received drafts of manual throughout the year and electronic meetings are held on a regular basis, in between the two in-person meetings. Committee members are technical experts who review all manual drafts (produced by the FPP editorial staff) and verify that the content is valid. Committee members are not paid, and IFSTA or Fire Protection Publications only reimburses them for their expenses associated with attending January meetings. Committee members participate because of their commitment to the fire service and its future through training. The History of IFSTA In 1933, newly hired Oklahoma A&M; Fire Training Coordinator W. Fred Heisler and Stillwater Fire Chief J. Ray Pence invited various fire service representatives from around the state of Oklahoma to Stillwater to discuss coordinated fire training efforts throughout the state. Five two-day courses covering ten basic fire fighting topics were developed. In 1933, Pence invited representatives from Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas to Stillwater. The Western Actuarial Bureau, a group of insurance companies, supported this meeting. As a result of this meeting, the participants saw a need to compile instructional manuals on the basics of fire fighting. In the fall of 1934, the Western Actuarial Bureau brought together a group of fire training representatives from Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas to a meeting in Kansas City. The participants determined that there was a great need to compile instructional manuals on the basics of fire fighting so that training would become more consistent. The discussions and decisions that resulted from this group formed the basis for procedures that are followed today and represented what was then called “The Fire Service Training Association (FSTA).” (“International” was added when Canada became a participant in 1955.) Oklahoma A&M; College (OAMC; now Oklahoma State University) was chosen to publish the works. The first professionally developed manuals that were written as a result of this meeting were released in 1937. They maintained the red covers used by previous OAMC fire publications. W. Fred Heisler, a teacher, trainer, and Director of Fire Service Training at Oklahoma A&M; from 1934-1951, was the author, coordinator, and editor of the “Redbooks” for the next 20 years. Heisler retired in 1955. After Heisler’s retirement, Everett Hudiburg became editor of the publication of the “Redbooks” – this operation was housed in the OSU Campus Fire Station. By 1965, the staff of FPP outgrew the fire station, and the people involved in the writing and publishing of the manuals were moved into Quonset Hut #2 – a World War II temporary building on the OSU campus. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, firefighters across the nation used the training manuals that were published at OSU. The publication and distribution of these fire training manuals continued until it evolved into a separate entity known as Fire Protection Publications (FPP) in 1969. It was led by its first full-time director, Harold Mace. In the early 1970s, FPP (the publisher of the “Redbooks”) and OSU Fire Service Training separated from the School of Fire Protection and became two cooperating entities. Today, FPP continues to serve as headquarters for the International Fire Service Training Association (IFSTA). FPP operates out of one recently-enlarged office building and a warehouse distribution center in the northwest portion of the OSU campus.

Biography David Gijsbert van der Linden, the son of a salesman of musical instruments, was born in Vlaardingen, near Rotterdam. Before World War II, he played in some different bands as a pianist and tried his hand at arranging music for these bands. His colleagues started calling him \\"Dolf\\", because he reminded them of a former colleague with that name.Profile: Dolf van der Linden, andtheconductoris.eu; accessed 22 June 2015. In 1945, he was asked by Dutch authorities who had arrived back from their exile in London to form an orchestra for light music. Picking musicians he knew from all over the Netherlands, he thus managed to create the Metropole Orchestra. Famous names from these early years were Benny Behr, Sem Nijveen (both violinists), Kees Verschoor (clarinetist) and Manny Oets (pianist).Profile: Dolf van der Linden, andtheconductoris.eu; accessed 22 June 2015. In 1957, van der Linden conducted the winning Dutch entry to the Eurovision Song Contest, \\"Net als toen\\", sung by Corry Brokken. In the year after, he and his orchestra accompanied the Eurovision Song Contest which was organised by Dutch TV in Hilversum. Afterwards, he was asked by, amongst others, the BBC to do some work for them. All in all, between 1957 and 1971, van der Linden conducted 13 Dutch Eurovision entries, amongst which two winners (in 1957 and 1959 - the latter song, \\"Een beetje\\", written by the pianist of his orchestra, Dick Schallies).Profile: Dolf van der Linden, andtheconductoris.eu; accessed 22 June 2015. In 1969 he refused to go to the Eurovision Song Contest in Spain, claiming that Francoist Spain reminded him too much of his experiences in World War II.

If Ghostscript is installed, it supports PostScript files. It is developed exclusively for Microsoft Windows, but it can run on Linux using Wine.  Features  Sumatra has a minimalist design, with its simplicity attained at the cost of extensive features. For rendering PDFs, it uses the MuPDF library. Sumatra was designed for portable use, as it consists of one file with no external dependencies, making it usable from an external USB drive, needing no installation. This classifies it as a portable application to read PDF, XPS, DjVu, CHM, eBooks (ePub and Mobi) and Comic Book (CBZ and CBR) formats. As is characteristic of many portable applications, Sumatra uses little disk space. In 2009, Sumatra 1.0 had a 1.21 MB setup file, compared to Adobe Reader 9.5's 32 MB. In January, 2017, the latest version of SumatraPDF, 3.1.2, had a single 6.1 Mb executable file; in comparison, Adobe Reader XI used 320 MB of disk space. The PDF format's use restrictions were implemented in Sumatra 0.6, preventing users from printing or copying from documents that the document author restricts, a form of Digital Rights Management. Kowalczyk stated \\"I decided that [Sumatra] will honor PDF creator's wishes\\". Other open-source readers like Okular and Evince make this optional, and Debian patches software to remove these restrictions, in accord with its principles of interoperability and re-use.Okular, Debian, and copy restrictions Through version 1.1, printing was achieved by rasterizing each PDF page to a bitmap. This resulted in very large spool files and slow printing. Since version 0.9.1, hyperlinks embedded in PDF documents have been supported. Sumatra is multilingual, with 69 community-contributed translations. Sumatra supports SyncTeX, a bidirectional method to synchronize TeX source and PDF output produced by pdfTeX or XeTeX. Since version 0.9.4, Sumatra supports the JPEG 2000 format.  Development  Sumatra PDF is written mainly by two contributors: Krzysztof Kowalczyk and Simon Bünzli. The source code is developed in two programming languages, mostly in C++, with some components in C. The source code is provided with support for Microsoft Visual Studio. As it was first designed when Windows XP was the current version of Windows, Sumatra initially had some incompatibilities with earlier versions of Windows. Support for Windows 95, 98 and ME has since been removed. Initially, Kowalczyk did not release a 64-bit version of Sumatra, indicating that while it might offer slightly more speed and available memory, he believed at that time that it would greatly add to user confusion and that the benefits would not outweigh the potential costs. However, some users requested 64-bit builds of Sumatra and other developers had compiled unofficial 64-bit builds which loaded documents faster than the 32-bit builds. However, the official builds' developer had requested that unofficial builds not bear the 'Sumatra' name. In October 2015, an official 64-bit version of Sumatra was released. The Sumatra source code was originally hosted on Google Code. Due to US export legal restrictions, it was unavailable \\"in countries on the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control sanction list, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.\\" The source code is currently hosted on GitHub.  History  The first version of Sumatra PDF, designated version 0.1, was based on Xpdf 0.2 and was released on 1 June 2006. It switched to Poppler from version 0.2. In version 0.4, it changed to MuPDF for more speed and better support for the Windows platform. Poppler remained as alternative engine for a time, and from version 0.6 to 0.8 it was automatically used to render pages that MuPDF failed to load. Poppler was removed in version 0.9, released on 10 August 2008. In July 2009, Sumatra PDF changed its license from GNU GPLv2 to GNU GPLv3 to match the same license change on MuPDF.update the license to GPLv3, to match mupdf's license change on github.com on 3 Jul 2009 Version 1.0 was released on 17 November 2009, after more than three years of cumulative development. Version 2.0 was released on 2 April 2012, over two years after the release of version 1.0. In 2007, the first unofficial translations were released by Lars Wohlfahrt before Sumatra PDF got official multi-language support. In October 2015, version 3.1 introduced a 64-bit version, in addition to their original 32-bit version.Sumatra PDF version history  Name and artwork  Early Logo of Sumatra PDF, inspired by the Watchmen comic. The author has indicated that the choice of the name \\"Sumatra\\" is not a tribute to the Sumatra island or coffee, stating that there is no particular reasoning behind the name. The graphics design of Sumatra is a tribute to the cover of the Watchmen graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons.  Critical reception  Sumatra has attracted acclaim for its speed and simplicity, for being portable,This Amazing PDF Reader Is Portable And Tiny Submitted by Rob Schifreen on 21 July 2013 its keyboard shortcuts, and its open-source development. At one time the Free Software Foundation Europe recommended Sumatra PDF, but then removed its recommendation in February 2014, due to the presence of the non-freely licensed unrar code in Sumatra. Foundation representative Heiki Ojasild explained, \\"while they continue to make use of the non-free library, SumatraPDF cannot be recognised as Free Software\\". Unrar was eventually replaced with a free alternative in version 3.0, making it 100% free software.

He was fatally wounded in action in October 1914 at the First Battle of Ypres, being one of the most senior British officers to die on active service during the war. Early military career Born 2 August 1855 to Thomas and Mary Helen Lomax of Grove Park in Yoxford, Suffolk, Lomax joined the Scottish 90th Regiment of Foot as a junior officer aged eighteen in June 1874. In 1877 he went with the regiment to South Africa and participated in the 9th Cape Frontier War, and the latter phase of the Zulu War in 1878, seeing action at Kambula and Ulundi, which secured British victory in the campaign. Returning to Britain with his regiment Lomax was promoted to captain following the Cardwell Reforms which amalgamated his regiment into the Scottish Rifles in 1881. His unit was not called on for service in India or the Boer War and he did not see further action for 36 years. He was promoted to major in 1886, lieutenant-colonel in 1897, and colonel in 1901. In early 1902, he was transferred to a temporary staff posting as Assistant Adjutant General of the 2nd Army Corps from 26 February 1902, an appointment which was made permanent later the same year. In 1904 he was given an operational command, 10th Brigade. He was promoted to major-general in 1908, and in 1910 given command of the 1st Division.LOMAX, Maj.-Gen. Samuel Holt, in Who Was Who (2008) (online edition) This was normally a four-year posting, and in late July 1914 he received notice that he would not be further employed due to his advanced age and lack of military experience. World War 1 The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 put all plans of retirement on hold and Lomax was given command of the British Army's 1st Division as part of the Expeditionary Force being dispatched to France under the leadership of Sir General Sir John French. After taking part in the Battle of Mons in August 1914, Lomax commanded the Division through the First Battle of the Marne, and in the counter-attack on the German invasion of the West at the First Battle of the Aisne. His direction of operations was so accomplished that it has been said that he was \\"the best Divisional General in the early days of the war\\". On the 19 October 1914 he received notice that he was to be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General, and was marked to be given the command of a Corps when one next became available. =1st Battle of Ypres= In late October 1914 the 1st Division was engaged in extremely heavy fighting at the First Battle of Ypres in Belgium, with its headquarters in a chateau at Hooge, recently vacated by General Douglas Haig commanding I Corps. During the course of the battle, at a moment of crisis with 1st Division's line under mounting pressure from a German attack threatening the destruction of 1st Division and I Corps as a whole and a breach of the line being contested, Lomax received an offer from Haig of reinforcements from I Corps rapidly diminishing reserve troop strength being sent up to his sector to shore up its crumbling defences, Lomax refusing by reply, stating: \\"More troops now only means more casualties, it is artillery fire that is wanted\\".'At G.H.Q.' by John Charteris (Pub. Cassell, 1941), P.51. On 31 October 1914, at the height of the battle, with the Germans launching repeated mass man assaults on the weakening British line, supported by concentrated barrages of fire from their artillery, a meeting took place at the chateau H.Q. between Lomax and his 2nd Division counterpart, Major-General C. C. Monro. An eye-witness at the scene noted that the officers' staff parked along the roadside outside the building provided an obvious target to German artillery spotters seeking targets to call fire down on to. A German aviator is thought to have noticed the gathering and reported it to a German artillery unit, which fired several 5.9\\" shells at the chateau. Both sides had been targeting chateaux on either side of the line in an attempt to kill senior officers to gain some advantage in the dead-locked battle by this stage.P.29, Bloody Red Tabs, Davies & Maddocks The first shell exploded in the chateau's garden, causing the staff officers at the meeting to go to the windows of the garden room to see the result of the detonation, when the second shell landed in front of them, the blast killing six and seriously wounding Lomax and another officer.P.84, Bloody Red Tabs, Davies & Maddocks A third shell struck an empty part of the house, its owner, Baron de Vinck, narrowly escaping injury from that blast. General Monro had stepped into another room in the building with his Chief-of-Staff just before the shells struck, and survived with minor injuries,P.30, Bloody Red Tabs, Davies & Maddocks however Lomax was seriously wounded and medically evacuated back to England. Major-General David Henderson stepping in to assume command of the 1st Division. Death Samuel Lomax memorial in St Peter's Church at Yoxford On arrival back in England Lomax was treated in a nursing home in London, where he received palliative care for the next five months before dying of his wounds in his 60th year on the 10 April 1915. His body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, and its ashes were buried at Aldershot Military Cemetery, later to be joined by his wife's under a private headstone.Commonwealth War Graves database page for Lieutenant General Samuel Holt Lomax, Retrieved on the 14 March 2007 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle later wrote that Lomax's early death in the war had deprived the British High Command of a talented General, which \\"was a brain injury to the Army and a desperately serious one.\\" Notes References * * - Category:1855 births Category:1915 deaths Category:Cameronians officers Category:British Army personnel of the Anglo-Zulu War Category:British Army generals of World War I Category:British military personnel killed in World War I Category:Burials at Aldershot Military Cemetery Category:British military personnel of the 9th Cape Frontier War ","title":"Samuel Lomax"},{"id":"9791427","text":"Orson's Shadow is a play by Austin Pendleton. The play received a Lucille Lortel Award nomination for Outstanding Play and won the Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance. Plot The play, based on true events, is set in 1960 London. In his declining years, Orson Welles is directing a production of Eugène Ionesco's Rhinoceros, starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright. Olivier is fresh from his triumphant theatrical portrayal of vaudevillian Archie Rice and is about to reprise the role in the film adaptation of John Osborne's The Entertainer. He and Plowright are in the early stages of a romantic liaison; Olivier's tumultuous marriage to Vivien Leigh is all but ended. Critic Kenneth Tynan also figures in the plot, which debates the merits of stage versus screen, the internal struggle that theatrical performers endure when contemplating a leap to films, and the ways that the studio system frustrated the careers of individual artists. It is a study of theatrical egos, each of the protagonists living more on the stage than in real life, each one feeling insecure while jockeying for power.  Production history  =United States= The play debuted at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago in January 2000 and was performed at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego in September of that year.Citron, Cynthia.

It describes how the correlation between two molecules can be calculated. Its applications can mainly be found in fluid theory. In molecular theories of ionic solutions, this type of integral equation can be used as a probabilistic description how molecules (i.e. particles, ions, and colloids), distribute in space and time given their interaction energies.  Derivation  The derivation below is heuristic in nature: rigorous derivations require extensive graph analysis or functional techniques. The interested reader is referred to the text book for the full derivation. It is convenient to define the total correlation function: : h(r_{12})=g(r_{12})-1 \\\\, which is a measure for the \\"influence\\" of molecule 1 on molecule 2 at a distance r_{12} away with g(r_{12}) as the radial distribution function. In 1914 Ornstein and Zernike proposed to split this influence into two contributions, a direct and indirect part. The direct contribution is defined to be given by the direct correlation function, denoted c(r_{12}). The indirect part is due to the influence of molecule 1 on a third molecule, labeled 3, which in turn affects molecule 2, directly and indirectly. This indirect effect is weighted by the density and averaged over all the possible positions of particle 3. This decomposition can be written down mathematically as : h(r_{12})=c(r_{12}) + \\\\rho \\\\int d \\\\mathbf{r}_{3} c(r_{13})h(r_{32}) \\\\, which is called the Ornstein–Zernike equation. Its interest is that, by eliminating the indirect influence, c(r) is shorter-ranged than h(r) and can be more easily described. If we define the distance vector between two molecules \\\\mathbf{r}_{ij}:= \\\\mathbf{r}_{i}-\\\\mathbf{r}_{j} for i,j=1,2,3, the OZ equation can be rewritten using a convolution. : h(\\\\mathbf{r}_{12})= c(\\\\mathbf{r}_{12}) + \\\\rho \\\\int d \\\\mathbf{r}_{3} c(\\\\mathbf{r}_{12}-\\\\mathbf{r}_{32})h(\\\\mathbf{r}_{32}) = c(\\\\mathbf{r}_{12}) + \\\\rho \\\\int d \\\\mathbf{r}_{32} c(\\\\mathbf{r}_{12}-\\\\mathbf{r}_{32})h(\\\\mathbf{r}_{32}) = c(\\\\mathbf{r}_{12}) + \\\\rho (c\\\\, *\\\\, h)(\\\\mathbf{r}_{12}) \\\\, . If we then denote the Fourier transforms of h(\\\\mathbf{r}) and c(\\\\mathbf{r}) by \\\\hat{H}(\\\\mathbf{k}) and \\\\hat{C}(\\\\mathbf{k}), respectively, and use the convolution theorem we obtain : \\\\hat{H}(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\hat{C}(\\\\mathbf{k}) + \\\\rho \\\\hat{H}(\\\\mathbf{k})\\\\hat{C}(\\\\mathbf{k}), \\\\, which yields : \\\\hat{C}(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\frac{\\\\hat{H}(\\\\mathbf{k})}{1 +\\\\rho \\\\hat{H}(\\\\mathbf{k})} \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\text{and} \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\hat{H}(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\frac{\\\\hat{C}(\\\\mathbf{k})}{1 -\\\\rho \\\\hat{C}(\\\\mathbf{k})}. \\\\, One needs to solve for both h(r) and c(r) (or, equivalently, their Fourier transforms). This requires an additional equation, known as a closure relation. The Ornstein–Zernike equation can be formally seen as a definition of the direct correlation function c(r) in terms of the total correlation function h(r). The details of the system under study (most notably, the shape of the interaction potential u(r)) are taken into account by the choice of the closure relation. Commonly used closures are the Percus–Yevick approximation, well adapted for particles with an impenetrable core, and the hypernetted- chain equation, widely used for \\"softer\\" potentials. More information can be found in. Closure relations Closure relations are independent second equations that connect the total correlation h(r) and the direct correlation c(r). The Ornstein-Zernike equation and a second equation are needed in order to solve for two unknowns: the total correlation h(r) and the direct correlation c(r). The word \\"closure\\" means that it closes or \\"completes\\" the conditions for a unique determination of h(r) and c(r).

The film was produced by Anouk Frosch and Jonathan Blitstein. It was photographed by Andrew Shulkind. The release began December 5, 2008 in select theaters.http://www.cinemavillage.com/chc/cv/show_movie.asp?movieid=1417 It received positive reviews in Variety,https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939148.html?categoryid=31&cs;=1&query;=let+them+chirp+awhile the Village Voice and TimeOut NY. Opening weekend in NYC had a sold out screening on Saturday December 6, 2008 with the cast in attendance for Q+A. The film had its World Premiere at the 2007 Woodstock Film Festival in Woodstock, NY where it received acclaim from both audiences and critics. The director of the festival, Meira Blaustein called the film \\"a hidden gem\\" and praised Blitstein's \\"unique eye\\" during her introduction prior to the first screening,http://www.woodstockfilmfestival.com as the film had been accepted through regular submission. Plot Bobby and Scott, two young men in their late-twenties living in New York City, are struggling to make careers out of their artistic dreams. Bobby is a struggling writer and Scott is a struggling musician. Despite being close friends, their competitiveness with each other gets in the way. Neither of them are productive because they don't believe in themselves and both share incredibly high standards for their work. Bobby casually dates a New York University student, but struggles to look past their age difference. Bobby meets an old lover, Deirdre, who is headed to Los Angeles, and begs Bobby to take care of her dog while she's away. Bobby agrees but only in exchange for a sexual favor upon her return. Bobby soon loses Deirdre's dog and has a chance encounter with a cashier at a clothing store. Later, when Bobby makes the mistake of sharing an idea for the opening of his new screenplay with Scott, Scott tells their mutual friend, Hart, a playwright. Hart steals the idea, incorporating it in his new play \\"Death of a Banker,\\" a campy morality tale starring Anthony Rapp about the September 11 attacks, which is set to be performed off-Broadway later that month. Cast * Justin Rice — Bobby * Brendan Sexton III — Scott * Laura Breckenridge — Dara * Zach Galligan — Hart Carlton * Pepper Binkley — Michelle * Charlotte af Geijerstam — Charlotte * Amy Chow — Ariel * Anthony Rapp — Himself Production Blitstein, was the youngest independent filmmaker ever to write, direct, produce, and edit a 35mm color feature-length film which was ultimately released in theaters. He wrapped shooting on October 24, 2006 when he was still twenty-three years old. After months of thinking and planning his script concept, Blitstein wrote the first draft script in 27 days and proceeded to assemble an indie crew composed mostly of friends he met at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. The total projected budget of the film was nearly $600,000, but because of donated 35mm film, equipment, and services from New York City rental houses and friends of Blitstein and Frosch, the film was completed on the last day of shooting with only $99,000. The film was funded by friends, family members, and Blitstein's own personal savings from his job as a waiter. Blitstein also \\"maxed out\\" more than seven credit cards. Locations used included Blitstein's East Village apartment, the apartments of his friends, and restaurants and local shops within walking distance. Blitstein convinced companies like Fender and Pabst Blue Ribbon to allow him to show their logos in the film to lend realism instead of using fake logos or covering logos which happens in many low-budget independent films. Blitstein cast the film by cold-calling agents of actors he was interested in working with. By convincing the agent's assistants to read his script, he got a foot in the door, and agents and actors began to express interest based on the script, even though Blitstein was an unknown filmmaker. The shoot was 18 days long and most of the film was shot in 1 or 2 takes because neither Blitstein or his production team knew how much film was going to arrive on set each day. Sometimes shots were done in a single take in order to save time and film. On the 12th day of the shoot, Blitstein collapsed due to stress and lack of sleep. He was admitted to the emergency room at the Beth Israel Hospital nearby. Doctors discovered an unrelated non-life-threatening kidney abnormality (Blitstein was born with a single kidney), and Blitstein quickly recovered, returning to set the next morning to complete the shoot. Blitstein edited the film in 47 days using a 12\\" MacBook. Theme Aaron Graham of Uptown Magazine wrote that the film \\"[Owes] much more to the early, sprightly comedies of Brian De Palma (Greetings, Hi, Mom!) than to overplayed Mumblecore\\". The film has been repeatedly compared to mumblecore films such as Mutual Appreciation, which also stars Justin Rice, although Blitstein has stated that he is not influenced by or associated with the mumblecore genre.http://www.uptownmag.com/2008-12-18/page3282.aspx \\"Let Them Chirp Awhile is a mix of realism and romanticism. Scoring the struggles of today's self- obsessed young people with the vintage sounds of melodramatic orchestral music, the film celebrates and satirizes their hopes, fears and dreams. The East Village becomes a place where everyday conflicts like having a meaningless idea appropriated by a friend, or a breakup are heightened to meet the characters' inflated visions of themselves. Let Them Chirp Awhile is as much a throwback to old films as it is a look forward into the destiny-anxiety that afflicts all of us in the digital age.\\"http://www.letthemchirpawhile.com Screenings World Premiere at the 2007 Woodstock Film Festival - October 11, 12, 2007 (Opening Night Screening) * Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival - October 26, November 1, 2007 * Santa Fe Film Festival - November 28 - December 2, 2007 (Opening Night Screening) * CINE-WORLD Festival - Florida 2007 * East Lansing Film Festival - March 12–20, 2008 * Filma Madrid Spain - March 28 - April 5 (European Premiere) * Sonoma Valley Film Festival - 9 -13, 2008 * Atlanta Film Festival - April 10–19, 2008 * Rhode Island International Film Festival (Centerpiece Film) - August 5–10, 2008 * Mar del Plata International Film Film Festival Buenos Aires (South American Premiere) November 5–21, 2008 Awards * Winner - \\"Best Feature Film\\" - East Lansing Film Festival 2008 * Finalst - \\"Independent Spirits Award\\" - Santa Fe Film Festival 2007 * Finalist - NYU's \\"Richard Vague Award Foundation\\" - 2007https://archive.is/20121210141716/http://www.factory630.com/files/vague_press_release.pdf References * http://www.cinemavillage.com/chc/cv/show_movie.asp?movieid=1417 * https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939148.html?categoryid=31&cs;=1&query;=let+them+chirp+awhile * http://www.woodstockfilmfestival.com * https://archive.is/20121210141716/http://www.factory630.com/files/vague_press_release.pdf External links * \\"Let Them Chirp Awhile Official Website\\" * \\"New York Times Movie Page\\" * \\"2007 Woodstock Film Festival\\" * \\"Santa Fe New Mexican Article\\" From 12.13.2007 * \\"Pitchfork Article\\" From 03.23.07 * \\"IndieWire Article\\" From 11.06.06 * \\"CHUD.com Article\\" From 08.31.06 * Category:2007 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American independent films ","title":"Let Them Chirp Awhile"},{"id":"9791492","text":"Bataan dialect may refer to: *The Tagalog language dialect spoken in Bataan *The Kapampangan language dialect spoken in Bataan *The Mariveleño language ","title":"Bataan dialect"},{"id":"9791512","text":"US elastic bandage, used in Vietnam War Era An elastic bandage is a \\"stretchable bandage used to create localized pressure\\". Elastic bandages are commonly used to treat muscle sprains and strains by reducing the flow of blood to a particular area by the application of even stable pressure which can restrict swelling at the place of injury. Elastic bandages are also used to treat bone fractures. Padding is applied to the fractured limb, then a splint (usually plaster) is applied. The elastic bandage is then applied to hold the splint in place and to protect it. This is a common technique for fractures which may swell, which would cause a cast to function improperly. These types of splints are usually removed after swelling has decreased and then a fiberglass or plaster cast can be applied. Due to the risk of latex allergies among users, the original composition of elastic bandages has changed. While some bandages are still manufactured with latex, many woven and knitted elastic bandages provide adequate compression without the use of natural rubber or latex. The modern elastic bandage is constructed from cotton, polyester and latex-free elastic yarns. By varying the ratio of cotton, polyester, and the elastic yarns within a bandage, manufacturers are able to offer various grades of compression and durability in their wraps. Often aluminum or stretchable clips are used to fasten the bandage in place once it has been wrapped around the injury. Some elastic bandages even use Velcro closures to secure and stabilize the wrap in place. Aside from use in sports medicine and by orthopedists, elastic bandages are popular in the treatment of lymphedema and other venous conditions. However, some compression wraps are inadequate for the treatment of lymphedema or chronic venous insuffiency. They provide a high resting compression and low active compression. A more appropriate use for compression in treating lymphedema or other edema conditions would be TG shapes, tensoshapes, compression socks or compression wraps for acute conditions or exacerbation. Physical therapists and occupational therapists have special training and certifications to apply appropriate compression wraps for edema and lymphedema. Elastic bandages can also be used for weight loss when applied as a body wrap and rehabilitating injured animals through veterinary medicine. Elastic bandages should not be confused with compression therapy devices designed for the purpose of venous edema management or lymphedema management. Such devices are specifically designed to deliver graduated compression from the ankle to the knee, to assist with venous return.

Early life He was the eldest son of Lt.-Col. Hon. John Creighton, Governor of Hurst Castle and the former Jane Weldon (a daughter of Walter Weldon). His siblings included Maj. Hon. Henry Crichton (who married Elizabeth Hawkshaw), Lt.-Col. Hon. Samuel Crichton, Jane Anne Crichton (wife of Robert Fowler, eldest son of Rt. Rev. Robert Fowler, Bishop of Ossory), Lady Catherine Crichton (wife of the Rev. Francis Saunderson Rural), Lady Helen Crichton, Lady Charlotte Crichton, Lady Mary Crichton (wife of the Rev. John H. King). His paternal grandfather was John Creighton, 1st Earl Erne (eldest surviving son of Abraham Creighton, 1st Baron Erne) and the former Catherine Howard (sister of Ralph Howard, 1st Viscount Wicklow). Career In 1842, he succeeded to the earldom of Erne upon the death of his uncle, the 2nd Earl Erne. His uncle Abraham had been an MP for Lifford from 1790 to 1797 before he was declared insane in November 1798 and then incarcerated at Brooke House, London, for the next forty years. Abraham had succeeded to the titles upon the death of his father in September 1828. The third earl subsequently changed the spelling of the family name to Crichton. In 1845 he was elected an Irish Representative Peer in the House of Lords, which he remained until his death. He also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh from 1845 to 1885. Erne was made a Knight of the Order of St Patrick in 1868 and in 1876 he was created Baron Fermanagh, of Lisnaskea in the County of Fermanagh, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Lord Erne is also remembered as the employer of the hapless Captain Charles Boycott, whose mishandling of relations with agricultural workers on Lord Erne's estate in County Mayo caused a political and public order crisis and provoked the strategy that gave the English language the term to boycott. Personal life On 6 July 1837, Lord Erne was married to Selina Griselda Beresford, the second daughter of The Rev. Charles Cobbe Beresford, Rector of Termonmaguirk, and Amelia Montgomery (a daughter of Sir William Montgomery, 1st Baronet). Together, they were the parents of: * Lady Louisa Anne Catherine Crichton (1838–1866), who died unmarried. * John Henry Crichton, 4th Earl Erne (1839–1914), who married Lady Florence Mary Cole, daughter of William Willoughby Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen. * Hon. Charles Frederick Crichton (1841–1918), who married Lady Madeline Olivia Susan Taylour, eldest daughter of Thomas Taylour, 3rd Marquess of Headfort and Amelia Thompson (only child of Lord Mayor of London William Thompson), in 1873 * Hon. Sir Henry George Louis Crichton (1844–1922), the aide de camp to King Edward VII. He married Letitia Grace Cole-Hamilton, third daughter of Maj. Arthur Willoughby Cole-Hamilton in 1869. After her death in 1888, he married Lady Emma Baring, only daughter of Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook, in 1890. Lord Erne died in October 1885, aged 83, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son John, who became a Conservative government minister.Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

SplitFire claimed that its \\"V\\" electrode design improved combustion by allowing the ignited flame to pass through the gap in the electrode, instead of around it.  History  SplitFire spark plugs were popular and heavily advertised in the early 1990s. The manufacturer also sponsored the SplitFire Spark Plug 500 NASCAR stock car race, the SplitFire 200, various other powersports, and the Pro Bowlers Association SplitFire Spark Plug Open. In 1997, the United States Federal Trade Commission charged SplitFire with deceptive advertising. The manufacturer settled the charges with the FTC; as part of the settlement, SplitFire was prohibited from making what the FTC considered deceptive claims about fuel economy or emissions. After the settlement, the popularity of SplitFire's spark plug range declined. In 2002, it was still considered a leading sparkplug manufacturer, but by 2015, the company's products were not broadly distributed, and its official website had been removed.

The show started airing on 19 February 2007 replacing Kahiin To Hoga and ended on 12 March 2009. The show emphasized on how relationships change over the course of time and starred Shabbir Ahluwalia, Panchi Bora, Jay Bhanushali, and Sanjeeda Sheikh in lead roles. Plot Brought up in the lap of luxury, Neev Shergill and Prachi Shah are oblivious to the harsh realities of life. Neev and Prachi's childhood friendship blossoms into love. On the other hand, friends turned lovers Milind Mishra and Ayesha Mehra have lived in poverty all their lives. Prachi and Ayesha become close friends. Meanwhile, Prachi's brother Alaap starts a relationship with Milind's sister Sukriti. Things turn ugly between Prachi and Milind's families when Alaap humiliates Sukriti and dumps her after a one-night stand. Prachi is about to marry a man named Varun but he turns out to be a fraud. Finally, as Neev and Prachi are about to be married, it is revealed that Prachi and Ayesha are half-sisters. Prachi's father Inder had an affair with Ayesha's mother Amrita but left her for his wife Premlata and their daughter Prachi. Amrita became mentally unstable but Inder could never accept Ayesha. Ayesha begins to resent Prachi. She takes over the Shah family's business empire and blackmails Neev into marrying her. Shortly after they get married, Prachi discovers that Inder's death was not an accident but a murder. Milind, who had moved to Turkey for work, re-enters as a millionaire. To teach Ayesha a lesson as well as to make Prachi pay for Alaap's misdeeds, he presents Prachi with a deal: he will help her find her father's murderer if she agrees to marry him. Prachi accepts. Milind and Prachi's marriage leaves Neev and Ayesha devastated. Milind uses Prachi to make Ayesha jealous, but when alone, mistreats her. Slowly, Milind starts respecting and caring for Prachi. Ayesha constantly attempts to create misunderstandings between them by implying that Prachi is cheating on him with Neev. Neev discovers Ayesha manipulated Prachi into breaking up with him and wants her back but she refuses. Milind and Prachi confess their feelings and consummate their marriage. Prachi comes to know about Sukriti and Alaap's illegitimate son, Ritvik and brings the child home and pretends to be his mother. This infuriates Milind and he takes the matter to court. The two nearly get divorced, but the truth comes out just in time. A desperate Ayesha now decides to murder Prachi but Milind is hit by the car and he suffers partial amnesia forgetting Prachi is his wife. Ayesha forces Neev, who has ended his marriage with her, to marry Prachi so that Milind can be hers but before any wedding, Milind's memory returns and he adn Prachi reunite. A dejected Ayesha finally gives up. A businesswoman named Mallika falls for Milind. Ayesha warns her to stay away from Milind and Prachi. One night Mallika brings Milind to her uncle's farmhouse and spikes his drink, making him pass out. Ayesha shows up and in the ensuing scuffle, Mallika stabs and kills Ayesha. Prachi learns that she is pregnant but, before she can tell Milind, she finds out that Ayesha has been murdered and Milind is arrested for it. Mallika forces Prachi to leave Milind to help free him. Prachi agrees and leaves Milind to catch a train. In the meanwhile, Milind is released. He figures out that Mallika is responsible for Prachi's sudden decision to leave him. He tries to stop Prachi but in vain. Prachi reaches Kolkata and meets a Bengali couple - Proteek Dasgupta and his wife Panchi, who are travelling with their infant. Panchi hears out Prachi's story and urges Proteek to convince her to stay with them. Milind drives off to the station where Prachi's train is supposed to arrive. Upon reaching there, he and the Shahs come to know that there has been a blast on the train and assume Prachi is dead. =5 years later= It is revealed that Panchi had died in the bomb blast. Proteek honoured her last wish by inviting Prachi to stay with him and his family. When they arrived at the Dasgupta household, Prachi is assumed to be Panchi by Proteek's family. Proteek requests Prachi to pretend to be Panchi for the sake of his ailing father. Proteek and Prachi have been raising two children - Suprateek (Proteek and Panchi's son) and Sumonto (Milind and Prachi's son). Proteek has fallen in love with Prachi and hopes that she'll reciprocate his feelings someday. On Sumonto's birthday, Prachi gives him a gold chain she had made for Milind. Sumonto meets with an accident and receives blood from an anonymous donor at the hospital .The donor leaves behind his locket and Prachi realises it is Milind but does not approach him recalling Mallika's threat. She meets the social worker, Sushmita Mukherjee, accompanying Milind who tells her that she runs a rehab centre for the lonely. Milind is shown unkempt and shattered with a picture of Prachi. Proteek meets with an accident and is saved by Milind who is invited to stay with the Dasguptas. Prachi sees Milind but hides from him conflicted between her love for Milind and her responsibility to the Dasguptas. Milind begins to bond with Sumonto. After he comes face to face with Prachi, she explains why she's living with the Dasguptas and that Sumonto is his son. She urges him to keep their relationship a secret, but he vows to get his wife and son back. On the day Prachi and Proteek are to marry, the latter stops the wedding and says that he knows the truth about Milind. Milind and Prachi reunite and return to the Shah house with Sumonto. Alaap, though married to Sukriti, is having an affair with a woman called Kamya. Meanwhile, it appears that Ayesha has come back as Gayatri, Sumonto's school teacher. Alaap creates some problem because of which Milind is expected to give 120 crores to some creditors in six months. He is forced to mortgage his house to their boss who is revealed to be Kamya. Gayatri helps Prachi get a job. On Prachi and Milind's wedding anniversary, the whole family gives them a surprise party. Prachi wants to introduce Gayatri to Milind but finds her gone. Then Gayatri reveals that she is Ayesha's spirit, whom no one but Prachi can see. The spirit tells Prachi that she will get into her body and live as Milind's wife. The spirit makes Prachi befriend Kamya. Meanwhile, Alaap begins to change for the better. Sukriti decides to kill herself because of everything that has happened, but is saved by her friend Raghav. Alaap feels jealous. An elderly female relative, called Bua visits the family and becomes suspicious of Prachi's behaviour. She discovers that Prachi is being controlled by black magic being done by Neev's father, Pranay. Pranay had also killed Prachi's father Inder.

They are then sent a welcome package in the mail that includes their own personalized membership card, and gain access to online resources and environmentally-themed activities. Programs = Earth Rangers App = On January 21, 2020 Earth Rangers migrated their online kids portal to the Earth Rangers App. https://www.earthrangers.com/getapp The app creates a safe place for families to learn about nature, while empowering children to take environmental action by participating in missions (see below). The app is especially helpful for kids who experience \\"eco-anxiety\\" due to climate change by allowing them to take part in conservation efforts and be part of small but mighty solutions to help save animals.https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/new-app-aims-to-help-kids-suffering-from- eco-anxiety-due-to-climate-change-1.4794223?autoPlay=true Signs of eco-anxiety in children might include them expressing fear of the unknown, a lack of control over the future or feeling like there might be a catastrophe. The Earth Rangers App is free to download, and gives children access to programs and features such as: * Over 20 fun Missions that make a real and positive impact on the environment like planting trees, battery recycling drives, conserving energy and creating butterfly gardens * Animal Adoptions that allow you to support real, on the ground conservation projects across Canada * Virtual badges, leaderboards, and rewards for almost everything you do in the app * Endless entertainment and inspiration through hours of educational videos and thousands of fascinating articles about animals and the environment * Easy access to the award-winning Earth Rangers podcast * Points-based levelling system that allows you to journey through different habitats, unlocking cool animal facts along the way * Customizable avatars that allow you to create your own virtual identity * Free membership card and welcome package sent by mail when you complete your membership sign-up Regarding online safety, the Earth Rangers App does not share or make visible personally identifiable information, and privacy is strictly protected. Membership requires parent activation, and all comments posted on the Wild Wire blog are moderated by specially trained Earth Rangers staff. Additionally, the websites are audited on a regular basis to ensure they are PCI compliant. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. = Missions = Animal Ambassador \\"Hudson\\" the Eurasian Lynx Missions are fun, tangible activities Earth Rangers provides to members throughout the year that are designed to demonstrate the collective impact of working together to protect the environment. They address a wide range of issues and provide kids with ways to take action through things like conserving energy at home, organizing shoreline cleanups and planting pollinator gardens. Missions are also designed to be completed with the help of family and friends. The goal of this program is to educate and inspire children about biodiversity loss. = School Outreach = The Earth Rangers School Assembly is a presentation for Grades 1 to 6 that leverages the shared and innate connection children of all backgrounds have to animals. Through the power of live animal demonstrations, and positive, science-based information, the program educates students about the importance of protecting biodiversity, while highlighting diverse conservation initiatives across Canada. Throughout the show, students are introduced to four of the Earth Rangers Animal Ambassadors, such as Blue the Peregrine Falcon, Shelley the Painted Turtle, and Hudson the Eurasian Lynx. The program visits more than 800 schools across Canada each year. Earth Rangers also delivers hands-on, curriculum-linked Classroom Visits for Grades 3 to 6, which explore subjects like climate change, pollination, and wildlife habitats in more depth. All Earth Rangers get their own membership cards = Earth Rangers Clubs = Teachers worldwide can register their school's ecology club as an official Earth Rangers Club in order to help engaging their students in taking action to protect animals and the environment. By registering, they gain access to exciting activities and materials linked directly to the Canadian school curriculum. Similarly to the individual missions that Earth Rangers members participate in, clubs take on club- specific missions throughout the school year. The program is recommended for grades K-6 and can be adapted to grades 7 and 8. Missions are engaging and tangible environmental activities that help Club Members take action for important environmental issues. They can involve Club Members, a classroom or the entire school. = Wildlife Adoptions Program = The Wildlife Adoptions Program educates children and their families about the importance of biodiversity, highlights different species and conservation projects across Canada, and raises funds for research, species monitoring, and habitat conservation. To participate, children log into their account on the Earth Rangers App, where they learn about the various projects and select the animal they want to adopt, choosing between a virtual or a plushie adoption kit. Throughout the year, Earth Rangers headquarters provides updates on each project, ensuring that those participating in the program know how adoption funds were used and what was accomplished with them. Every adoption kit purchased helps support scientists and conservation partners working on tangible projects that can make a big difference for animals at risk. Whether it’s learning more about how grizzly bears use their habitat in Yukon’s Beaver River watershed, or helping restore meadow habitat through Toronto’s urban core, our projects reach the full breadth and depth of conservation work. = Earth Rangers Podcast = Led by Earth Ranger Emma, the Earth Rangers Podcast is a show for everyone who loves to explore the mysteries of nature. In addition to being available directly in the Earth Rangers App, the podcast is available through various podcast applications such as Apple Podcasts and Spotify. Facility Earth Rangers Centre for Sustainable TechnologyThe Earth Rangers Centre is an advanced green building, certified LEED Platinum for Existing Buildings and Gold for New species. The Earth Rangers Centre is located in Woodbridge, Ontario on the grounds of the Kortright Centre for Conservation. It is home to Earth Rangers’ staff and Animal Ambassadors, and is a showcase of leading edge sustainable building technology including energy metering, smart automation and controls, innovative water and wastewater management, solar generation, green roof, geothermal heating and cooling. = Ventilation = The Earth Rangers Centre was one of the first buildings in Canada to use displacement ventilation, and has the largest installation of earth tubes in North America. This ventilation system circulates air through diffusers located near the floor level and displaces the existing air into return ducts near the ceiling. = Data Centre = The Earth Rangers 9.3 square metre data centre was completed in December 2008. The data room uses storage servers from Pillar, Dell's processing servers, and virtual personal machines using VMware View software. Nortel's Power over Ethernet (PoE) switching facilitates the transfer of electrical power and data across the infrastructure.Heads Up Energy Efficiency Newsletter - March 2012 Earth Rangers also participates in Compugen's Green4Good program which works to combat the environmental impact of end-of-life technology products and support charities in need.New asset reuse program couples environmental and charitable benefits = Solar Electricity = The Earth Rangers Centre has two solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays in operation; both convert the sun's rays into standard voltage to be used by the building's systems. In the Earth Rangers Centre parking lot there is a 57.6 kWp dual-axis tracking array on six separate posts consisting of 54 Solgate 175 W panels, provided by Sentinel Power Systems. Each array follows the sun from east to west during the day, increasing output by up to 30 per cent over a fixed panel. Each panel has its own micro-inverter, further increasing the efficiency of the arrays and allowing real-time monitoring of the system on panel by panel basis. The second array is located on the aviary, a building that boasts a 28.08 kWp, designed and installed by Enviro-Energy Technologies Inc.Enviro-Energy Technologies Inc. This offsets approximately 10% of the Earth Rangers Centre's annual needs.Earth Rangers Aviary 28.08kW Earth Rangers = Heating and Cooling = The Earth Rangers Centre was one of the first 100% radiant heated and cooled buildings in North America. The building uses 22 km of REHAU radiant tubing, which was laid within the concrete floors and ceiling. The flow of a non-toxic, vegetable-based liquid (water/glycol) through these tubes causes the concrete to become thermally activated. In the warm seasons, cooled liquid is supplied to the concrete slabs. The heat from the computers, people and the sun is absorbed by the concrete, causing the cooled liquid in the tubing to warm up. The liquid is then cooled by rejecting heat to the ground source system or free cooled by directly coupling to the cooling tower. In the colder months, the glycol is warmed by the ground source heat pump before it is supplied to the slab system. Animal ambassadors The Earth Rangers Centre houses over 40 animals that act as Animal Ambassadors for the organization, including ring-tailed lemurs, red foxes, bald eagles, African servals, and American kestrels.

Life and work Lewis Paul was of Huguenot descent. His father was physician to Lord Shaftesbury. He may have begun work on designing a spinning machine for cotton as early as 1729, but probably did not make practical progress until after 1732 when he met John Wyatt, a carpenter then working in Birmingham for a gun barrel forger. Wyatt had designed a machine, probably for cutting files, in which Paul took an interest. Roller spinning was certainly Paul's idea, and Wyatt built a machine (or model) for him. Paul obtained a patent for this on 24 June 1738. He then set about trying to license his machine, though some licences were granted in satisfaction of debts. In 1741, he set up a machine powered by two asses in the Upper Priory in Birmingham, near his house in Old Square. Mills using the roller spinning patent Edward Cave, a publisher, obtained a licence and set up machines in a warehouse in London. In 1742, he acquired Marvel's Mill on the River Nene at Northampton. He rebuilt the mill to hold four or five water-powered spinning machines, each with 50 spindles. This was thus the first cotton mill. Cave died on 10 January 1754, so that the mill passed to his brother William and his nephew Paul. Samuel Touchet, a London merchant had the mill until 1755, but made no profit. It may then have been let to Lewis Paul, but he died in 1759. The Caves forfeited the lease for non-payment of rent in March 1761 and advertised the mill to let in November 1761. By 1768, the mill had reverted to being a corn mill. Another mill that operated under Paul's patent was at Leominster. This was built in 1744 by John Bourn in partnership with Henry Morris of Lancashire. The mill burnt down in November 1754. Carding machines In 1748, Daniel Bourn and Lewis Paul separately obtained patents for carding machines, which were presumably used in the Leominster and Northampton mills respectively. This carding technology of Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn seems to be the basis of later carding machines. Achievements The principle of his rolling spinning process was perfected by John Kay and Thomas Highs and promoted by Richard Arkwright. Retrieved on 2008-08-14 Retrieved on 2008-08-14 Paul's machine seems only to have been modestly profitable, and it is not clear to what extent his work is reflected in Arkwright's much more successful machine, the water frame, patented in 1769. Like Paul and Bourn, Arkwright subsequently added a carding stage to his machinery, but his use of this as a means of continuing his patent rights beyond the expiry of his original patent failed, because the improvement was not his invention.

History Arnold Pagenstecher and Staudinger both described this butterfly, under different names and the first description by Staudinger was based on a manuscript sent to him by Pagenstecher who possessed specimens from the collection of D. Wolf von Schönberg in Naumburg who had acquired them from a colonist in the then German New Guinea. Pagenstecher's name is Schoenbergia schoenbergi and the year of publication also 1893. Robert Henry Fernando Rippon in his illustrated monograph Icones Ornithopterorum (1898 to 1906) attributes the name paradisea to both entomologists i.e. as Ornithoptera paradisea Pagenstecher and Staudinger. The holotype is held by Zoologische Staatssammlung München. which also holds the type of Ornithoptera schoenbergi Pagenstecher. The type locality is the Finisterre Range, New Guinea. The specific epithet paradisea, is the Persian word for paradise. Description Illustration of both males and females Ornithoptera paradisea is a large butterfly with a wingspan ranging from 140 mm to 190 mm. As they are sexually dimorphic, males and females differ in the size, shape and colour of the wings. Male: Males have black forewings. The costal edge is black and there are two large, yellow gold and green bands. The underside of the male forewing is green with black veins and at the apex there is a black area. The hindwings are tiny triangles, golden and with thin tails. The inner edge of the hindwing is black and there is usually a green stripe between the golden area and the inner edge. The outer edge of the hindwing is usually green.The underside is very similar to the upperside but the inner edge is green and hairy. The hindwings have tails of uncertain selective origin.The only other tailed Ornithoptera is Ornithoptera meridionalis. The abdomen is yellow, the head and thorax are black and green. Female: O. paradisea is strongly sexually dimorphic and the significantly larger female covers the upper range of the wingspan.The basic colour is dark-brown. Two groups of white spots dominate the forewing and on the hindwings there is a white area with a yellow outer edge. Between these there is a chain of black spots. The underside is very similar to the upperside, but the colours are stronger. The abdomen is yellow, the head and thorax are black and green. Biology and life cycle Caterpillar The habitat is lowland or montane primary forest. Adult males fly high around trees rarely descending to the ground. Females fly below the canopy searching for the food plant which is a species of Aristolochia with orange fruits. The male emits a pleasant scent from the fringe of white hairs along the anal vein of the hindwing. The egg is 4 mm. in diameter and light orange. Eggs are laid singly and are attached to the ventral surface of an Aristolochia leaf or a nearby object. The first instar larva is dark red wine colour.Instars 2-5 are velvet black and bear red tubercles with long black tips.The pupa is brown with a bright yellow and orange saddlemark.It has a waxy coating and two short, sharp spurs on abdominal segments 3-6. The eggs are parasitised by species of Chalcidoidea and the larvae are parasitised by Braconidae. Ants, lizards and birds eat the larvae and pupae and in monsoon the larvae suffer 30% mortality. The paradise birdwing is closely related to Ornithoptera meridionalis. Subspecies Illustration of females *†Ornithoptera paradisea paradisea Staudinger, 1893 — Huon Peninsula to Astrolabe Bay in lowlands. This is the nominate subspecies and it is now extinct. *Ornithoptera paradisea borchi (Haugum & Low, 1974) — Central parts of the Northern Ranges: Torricelli and Alexander Mountains, and at Dreikir, East Sepik district, at altitudes from 1500 feet but mostly from 2000 to 3000 feet. the male abdomen has a simple median pattern, the dorsal fringes are snow white, the outer margin of hindwiing averaging and additional golden and iridescent green spots present with a larger frequency than in the nominate subspecies. Females have a modified wing-shape and pattern. *Ornithoptera paradisea chrysanthemum (Kobayashi & Koiwaya, 1979) *Ornithoptera paradisea demeter (So & Sato, 1998) — type locality: Papua New Guinea, Southern Highlands Province, Lake Kutubu. *Ornithoptera paradisea detanii Schäffler, 2001 — Sudirman Range *Ornithoptera paradisea flavescens Rothschild, 1897 — Etna Bay, probably lowland. Based on a sole female specimen and the status is doubtful. Original description *Ornithoptera paradisea arfakensis Joicey & Noakes, 1915 — Arfak Mountains of the Vogelkop Peninsula, high altitude. A very distinct purely high-altitude subspecies, and the distribution is separated from that of the nominate subspecies. Considered a full species by some recent authors. The 2004 revision by Gilles Delisle accepts three subspecies Troides paradisea paradisea, Troides paradisea chrysanthemum and Troides paradisea arfakensis Joicey & Noakes, 1915 Conservation Supported by World Association of Zoos and Aquariums who claim that Papua New Guinea farmers achieve more income with breeding butterflies for life exhibits in zoos than with cultivation of coffee encourage support for the natural butterfly populations by cultivating food plants. Income is also made from sales to collectors. In his 1983 report to the Department of Primary Industries, Papua New Guinea, M.J. Parsons wrote that \\"Ironically it is now becoming an accepted fact that the very demand for Ornithoptera is one of the main assets which will ensure their future survival if they can be exploited in the correct way.\\"Parsons, M.J.

An open trailer designed specifically for carrying a motorcycle -- with a 1954 BMW R67/3 Interior of a 12-foot Wells Cargo enclosed motorcycle trailer. A motorcycle trailer is either a trailer used to carry motorcycles or one to be pulled by a motorcycle in order to carry additional gear. Motorcycle carrying trailers Motorcycle carrying trailers may be open or enclosed. They may be wide, for two machines side-by- side, or narrow, for just a single machine. The main features that distinguish them from other flatbed or enclosed trailers are track(s) to keep the wheels from sliding side to side and sufficient tiedown points to keep the motorcycle(s) from tipping. They may also tilt, or include ramp(s) to facilitate the loading and unloading of motorcycles. Trailer manufacturers often offer trailers specifically designed for carrying motorcycles. General purpose enclosed trailers, as seen in the photo above left, have the advantage of providing a more secure way of locking up the motorcycles contained within it, keeping them out of sight, and protecting them from all kinds of weather. However, as they are heavier than open trailers and create more wind resistance, pulling a general purpose enclosed trailer can decrease the fuel efficiency of the tow vehicle. Conversely, an enclosed motorcycle-specific trailer can be built low enough so that wind resistance is reduced. As a result, fuel efficiency is better than towing a general purpose enclosed trailer. Collapsible or folding motorcycle trailers are available to overcome storage problems that might prevent use of a non-collapsible trailer, some such trailers are sufficiently compact to allow the user to carry the trailer in the trunk of a car when not in use. = Types = The basic motorcycle trailer design consists of a fixed platform mounted above one or more axles, which requires the motorcycle be loaded by physically lifting it or rolling it up a ramp onto the platform, potentially a difficult problem when dealing with a heavy touring machine or one that has been disabled. Since the latter half of the 20th century a number of different trailer styles have been devised to make loading motorcycles on them easier. Broadly, such designs include: *Tilt- bed, wherein the platform teeters on the axle, bringing the tail of the trailer to ground level. The motorcycle is pushed or ridden onto the trailer bed, which in some designs automatically tilts back to the horizontal and locks in place when the load moves forward of the bed pivot point. Such designs still require the machine be pushed up an inclined plane. *Drop-bed, wherein the platform is lowered to the ground in a substantially horizontally fashion and the motorcycle has only to be rolled or ridden over the lip of the platform and secured to it, whereupon the entire platform and load are raised and secured for towing. Such designs only require the machine be raised by the thickness of the platform, which is typically less than 10 cm (4 in). Numerous mechanical designs have been devised by trailer fabricators to achieve this goal. Trailers pulled behind motorcycles A Honda Goldwing towing a trailer A Honda ST 1100 towing a caravan Motorcycle trailer in Cambodia Teardrop trailer in Germany Motorcycle dog trailer PAV trailer in Hungary Trailers towed behind motorcycles are distinguished by their relatively small size, especially narrow wheelbase. They are also often styled to match the look of the motorcycle they are intended to be towed behind. This styling can include the overall shape, fender shape, lights, chrome, etc. = Types = Cargo trailers Cargo trailers provide extra storage space on for bikers whose motorcycles have little storage. The most popular models are made of fiberglass or aluminum and ride on two wheels. Open or utility trailer Motorcycle utility trailers are uncovered, single-axle, flatbed trailers. These trailers are designed to be towed by a motorcycle, so they are much smaller than standard open trailers which must be towed by a four-wheel vehicle. Dog trailer Motorcycle dog trailers are designed to transport the animals in safety and comfort. They are fully enclosed, well ventilated and have suspension. Motorcycle camping trailers Two types of trailers prevail within the motorcycle camping trailers category: clamshell and platform camper trailers. Fabric material is attached to the top and bottom halves of the clamshell trailer. The tent is created when the trailer is opened. Once a platform camping trailer is opened, however, the tent is pitched on it. These platform style camping trailers are larger than clamshell camping trailers and can fit full-sized to king-sized air mattresses. Most often, clamshells can only accommodate a single occupant. The Pav 40/41/100 The Pav trailers were manufactured in the Czech Republic, originally by \\"AVIA n.p\\". and later by \\"KOVOZAVODY SEMILY\\" by Jawa Moto. Earliest examples were made in the mid- to late-1950s, which pre-date the PAV 40. The PAV 40 debuted in approximately 1958 or 1959. The PAV 41 eventually replaced the PAV 40 and was produced into the 1970s. Pav trailers feature a single wheel and are rated to . They were made to be attached to Jawa motorcycles, although they make excellent accessories for Vespa, Lambretta, Cezeta, Heinkel, Fuji, Zundapp, Cushman, or any other vintage motorcycle, scooter or microcar (like Isetta or Messerschmitt). Having just one wheel, these trailers are attached to the towing vehicle by a hitch that has only two degrees of freedom — pitch and yaw. Hitching a trailer to a motorcycle In order to tow a trailer behind a motorcycle, one of the following coupling combinations or mechanisms is needed: a ball and socket, swivel adapter, or pivot ball hitch and coupler. = Ball and socket = Ball and Socket Coupler Most trailers are towed by joining a ball and a coupler (socket). The coupler is attached to the trailer, and the ball hitch is attached to the tow vehicle. The coupler slides over the ball hitch. Then, pressure is applied to a clamp, usually with a toggle or lever, which secures the ball in the coupler. When properly attached, the coupler will have limited movement, swiveling mainly right and left as well as tilting slightly. =Swivel adapter (swivel coupler - swivel hitch)= Underside view of a swivel adapter (swivel coupler - swivel hitch) The swivel adapter, more commonly referred to as a swivel coupler or swivel hitch, functions by connecting one end to the trailer tongue and the other end directly to the hitch on the tow vehicle or to a coupler. This mechanism is engineered to rotate on the vertical axis so as to eliminate the possibility of coupler binding. As a result, the motorcyclist is able to lean into a turn as far as necessary at high speeds while keeping the trailer upright. =Anti-binding motorcycle trailer hitch assembly (pivot ball hitch)= Anti-binding motorcycle trailer hitch assembly (pivot ball hitch) The pivot ball hitch is an anti-binding motorcycle trailer hitch assembly composed of a base and a trailer ball. The base is secured to a standard ball mount on the motorcycle. The trailer is attached to a socket coupler. A space between the ball shank and the assembly mount allow the ball to move left and right in a vertical plane. Thus, the ball remains in a generally upright position when the motorcycle leans left or right into a turn because the base of the pivot ball hitch is able to move in the opposite direction of the motorcycle without causing the coupler to bind. =Coupler binding= Making a turn on a single-track vehicle such as a two-wheeled motorcycle requires the driver to lean the bike. The amount of the lean is dependent upon the speed. Faster speeds require more leaning than slower speeds do. When making a turn with a trailer attached, the mechanism that joins the trailer to the motorcycle must allow for an appreciable lean in order for a trailer to stay upright. Without the ability to freely rotate on a vertical axis, the coupler will bind and the trailer will jack-knife or flip. As explained above in \\"Ball and socket\\", the movement in the coupler and ball combination is limited to mostly horizontal movement and tilting slightly. Therefore, this type of coupling is best suited for three-wheeled motorcycles and four-wheeled vehicles. In contrast, as pivot ball hitches and swivel adapters do allow the appreciable lean necessary to keep all the trailer wheels on the ground while turning, these devices are the better option for towing trailers behind a two- wheeled motorcycle. However, the standard car type \\"ball and socket\\" couplings used in the United Kingdom are perfectly adequate for two wheeled motorcycles providing plenty of lean angle. = Towing restrictions in the United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, there are some legal restrictions on towing trailers. * Only motorcycles with engine displacement over may tow. * The motorcycle must be marked with its kerbside weight. * The trailer must not be wider than . * The distance between the rear axle of the motorcycle and the rear-most part of the trailer must not exceed . * The laden weight of the trailer must not exceed or two-thirds of the kerbside weight of the motorcycle, whichever is lighter. * The trailer must be clearly and indelibly marked with its unladen weight. * The UK speed limit is 60 mph on motorways and dual carriageways and 50 mph on all other roads unless a lesser limit is in force. * The trailer must display the same registration plate as the towing vehicle. * Trailers must have two red sidelights, two red stop lights, a number plate light, two triangular red reflectors and amber indicators (which flash between 60 and 120 times per minute) at the rear. * All trailers built after September 30, 1990 also require white front reflectors. = Safety = Tips for towing include: *Motorcycle manufacturers do not recommend that trailers be towed by their motorcycles because of the increased safety hazards. All towing is done at the operator's own risk. *A ball hitch, where used, should be well greased at all times to facilitate smooth cornering. *While towing a trailer, one must remember to ride closer to the center of the lane, taking the width of trailer into account. Be careful of the \\"oil strip\\" in the center of the lane at intersections, especially when it begins to rain after an extended dry spell. Also, watch for uneven road surfaces and road edges that can unbalance the trailer. *Keep enough of the weight forward of the axle to maintain a positive hitch load when loading the trailer.

In 2012, it has 11 Faculty and 6 Associate Faculty members, 5 support staff, 14 research associates and postdoctoral fellows, and 31 graduate students. It is known worldwide, in particular for weather radar research and Arctic studies. It has operated the second oldest weather observatory in Canada since 1862. History Since 1840, Charles Smallwood, a medical doctor and avid amateur meteorologist, was taking daily weather reports at his house in the village of Saint-Martin on Île Jésus (now Laval a suburb of Montreal). He was named \\"honorary professor\\" in Meteorology at McGill University in 1856, and at his suggestion, the first McGill Weather Observatory was established in 1862. The first instruments were donated by Smallwood et he was the first director of the Observatory. Since then, there is regular measurement of meteorological variables taken on University grounds, one of the longest record in Canada. After the death of Smallwood in 1873, the position of professor in Meteorology was not filled for 88 years. However, the director of the Observatory was, and the second to occupy this post was the engineer C. H. McLeod, an assistant to Smallwood since his university days. McLeod began his term while Canada was setting up a Meteorological Service. He was instrumental to its development and to research on the subject by McGill. Professors of the McGill's Physics department began to work on meteorological projects and later, professors from Geography did too. Following the Second World War, two active atmospheric research groups emerged at McGill. Dr J. Stewart Marshall and R.H. Douglas led a radar meteorology group (Stormy Weather Group) in the Physics Department, and Dr F. Kenneth Hare directed an arctic meteorology program in Geography. These two groups united in 1959 to form the Department of Meteorology. In 1986, McGill University formed the first Canadian group of research on climate with the National Research Council of Canada (CNRC). Four years later, the mandate was widened, and its staffing enlarged. It is now the Centre for Climate and Global Change Research (C2GCR). The department started the Centre for research in mesoscale meteorology, in collaboration with the Meteorological Service of Canada, and it operates J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory since 1968. Since 1850, McGill has been involved in oceanography but the main development in this field came when the Centre for Marine Studies was created in 1963, later renamed Oceanographical Institute. Under the leadership of Dr Max J. Dunbar, the Institute was managing Master and Doctorate programs in physical oceanography, and marine biology. In 1987, the Institute because the McGill department of Oceanography. In January 1992, the Meteorology department became the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences when the Oceanography department merged with it. Since its creation, the department has been a Canadian leader in the training of many distinguished atmospheric scientists. McGill has awarded over 230 M.Sc. degrees and more than 80 Ph.D. degrees in this field.  Programs  The department offers a BSc degree, with courses in atmospheric dynamics, thermodynamics and chemistry, in cloud physics, in climatology and general oceanography. The students maybe follow training toward research, a teaching, or operational meteorologist. The department offers one year certificates for students coming from other departments, like physics, to pursue M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs in meteorology and oceanography.

Fire Protection Publications is a department of Oklahoma State University College of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology (CEAT) in Stillwater, Oklahoma . This manual is used by fire service training agencies and departments around the world to train personnel to become firefighters. The Essentials of Fire Fighting is the required training manual used in countless local fire departments and state/provincial training agencies in every region of the United States and Canada. Since the release of the first edition of this manual in 1978, more than 2.5 million copies of the Essentials of Fire Fighting have been distributed to the fire service. The Essentials of Fire Fighting (7th edition) is divided into 5 sections (A through E) which contain 27 chapters. Chapters 1 through 22 focus strictly on fire fighting content as required by Chapters 4 and 5 of NFPA 1001, Standard for Fire Fighter Professional Qualifications (2019 edition). Chapter 23 provides meets the training requirements for the First Aid Provider emergency medical care competencies as identified in Chapter 6 of NFPA 1001. Chapters 24 through 26 meet the First Responder Awareness and Operations Levels for Responders according to NFPA 1072, Standard for Hazardous Materials/Weapons of Mass Destruction Emergency Response Personnel Professional Qualifications (2017 Edition) and OSHA 1910.120. The chapters also provide validated content to meet competency requirements of NFPA 472, Standard for Competence of Responders to Hazardous Materials/Weapons of Mass Destruction Incidents (2018 edition). The hazardous materials information is adapted from the IFSTA Hazardous Materials for First Responders (5th Edition). Chapter 27 meets the training requirements for the National Incident Management System - Incident Command System (NIMS-ICS) for NIMS-ICS Levels 100 and 200.  History of the Essentials of Fire Fighting  In 1934, the Western Actuarial Bureau sponsored a meeting in Kansas City to begin the process of gaining consensus on common training methods and techniques. State fire training directors from Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas attended and the Fire Service Training Association (FSTA) was formed. By its next meeting in 1935, 16 states were represented and more joined every year thereafter. Oklahoma A&M; College (OAMC, now known as Oklahoma State University) was chosen to publish the manuals to be developed by the Fire Service Training Association. In 1935, two planographed, hardbound books were produced: Elementary Science Applied to the Firefighting Service and Ladders. Eventually, a total of ten topics were covered and published in 1937. Because of their red covers, the fire service called them the 'Redbooks'. The ten original “Redbooks” were: * Forcible Entry, Ropes, Knots, and Extinguishers * Ground Ladders * Hose * Salvage and Overhaul * Fire Streams * Fire Apparatus * Ventilation * Rescue * First Aid * Fire Prevention and Inspection In 1955, FSTA becomes the International Fire Service Training Association or IFSTA when the first Canadian officials attended and participated in the annual validation conference. In 1957, Oklahoma A&M; College became Oklahoma State University. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, IFSTA became more active in the U.S. Fire Service. IFSTA was a participant in the Williamsburg meeting that led to the formation of the Joint Council of National Fire Service Organizations. Everett Hudiburg, director of IFSTA, was selected to chair the Joint Council and spearheaded the formation of the National Professional Qualifications Board (Pro Board). The Pro Board developed professional qualifications standards and a national certification system. The four original professional qualifications standards adopted in 1974 included: * Fire Fighters * Fire Officers * Fire Inspectors and Investigators * Fire Instructors When IFSTA realized that its products could be used to assist firefighters in achieving certification, the IFSTA manuals were revised to ensure they covered the appropriate NFPA standards. It was apparent that it would be impractical for firefighters to have to buy at least 10 manuals to meet the firefighter certification requirements. It was decided that a single manual should be developed to assist firefighters in achieving certification, and thus the Essentials of Fire Fighting was born. Carroll Herring, director of the Louisiana Fireman Training Program (now known as the Louisiana State University Fire and Emergency Training Institute, is credited with recommending the title of Essentials of Fire Fighting. The first edition of Essentials of Fire Fighting was published in 1978 and subsequent editions have been published in 1983, 1992, 1998, 2008, and 2013. The latest edition (7th) was first released in January 2019.  Chapter list  The 7th edition of Essentials of Fire Fighting addresses the 2019 edition of NFPA 1001, Standard for Fire Fighter Professional Qualifications and the 2017 edition of NFPA 1072, Standard for Hazardous Materials/Weapons of Mass Destruction Emergency Response Personnel Professional Qualifications. These standards are widely accepted as the standards of knowledge and skills measurement for all firefighters in North America and beyond. Essentials of Fire Fighting includes an appendix that lists the job performance requirements from the NFPA standards and cross-references those requirements to the chapters within the manual.

The exact date when the codex was produced is unknown, but scholars speculate it was crafted some time between the mid-16th and 17th centuries. The name of this important Mexica pictorial manuscript was suggested by its first editor, Robert H. Barlow, who erroneously interpreted the anthill on page 2 as the glyph for “Aztlán.” In the Bibliothèque nationale de France, where it is housed, it is known as Histoire mexicaine, [Manuscrit] Mexicain 59–64.Graulich, Michel. \\"Azcatitlán, Codex.\\" In David Carrasco ed. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures vol 1. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 66- 68 Characteristics The style of the codex combines traditional Mesoamerican artisanry with European Renaissance technique. Mexican historian noted the use of European methods to depict the codex's content such as the use of three-dimensional objects. The master tlacuilo also uses overlapping images to create depth, as in European art. Figures in the codex also have a greater degree of movement than in prior manuscripts. =Manufacture= The codex's construction combines the pre-Columbian Aztec method of accordion-folding, but is bound in the two-page European style. Each of the 25 leaves, made of European paper, is about high and wide. The images within the codex flow across the surface of the pages until it runs out of space. In that event, the last image of the set is recreated exactly for the first image of the succeeding set. Inconsistencies in that flow seem to indicate that some of the pages are missing. The manuscript is also incomplete; color is sporadically used, and there are still draft lines and empty spaces. This codex has two authors, or ', a master and an apprentice. The master laid out the entire narrative and then painted the more difficult and more important portions of the codex. The master observes Mesoamerican custom, most identifiable in his human figures, nearly always shown in profile, with angular faces looking to the right. The apprentice's figures, by contrast, use more curved lines and shadowing to better define the human body. He draws faces in profile until folio 9r, where a character looks directly at the observer. The master used bold and complete lines and coloration for his figures and glyphs. One or both of the tlaquiloque may have known Antonio Valeriano, the pro-Tlateloco Governor of Tenochtitlan from 1573 to 1599. They may have also studied at the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco. It appears that the master tlacuilo drew each set of specific year glyphs (Reed, Flint, House, Rabbit) in one session. This is alluded to by consistencies in form and inconsistencies in color by set. Once these were painted, he added the corresponding years in the Julian calendar, which in their forms resemble the glosses added to the codex later. The first instances of work by the apprentice tlacuilo are found on folio 6v, as there appear houses shaded as per his method. He takes over completely until folio 12r, when the Mexica arrive at Tenochtitlan. History It is not known when the manuscript was created, or whether it was first painted and then bound, or vice versa. Historian María Castañeda de la Paz has proposed the second half of the 16th century as the window of time in which Codex Azcatitlan was authored. The writing of the glosses in Nahuatl suggests a date in the last third of the sixteenth century, but the glosses may not be contemporary with the drawings, since the glossarist did not always understand them correctly.Graulich, Michel. \\"Azcatitlán, Codex.\\" In David Carrasco ed. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures vol 1. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 66- 68 At some point it belonged to the Milanese nobleman Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci (1702–1755), who mentions it in his Idea de una nueva historia general de la América septentrional. Later it was part of the collections of Joseph-Marius-Alexis Aubin and of Eugène Goupil in France. At the latter's death in 1898, it was donated to the Bibliothèque Nationale. Of the twenty- eight original leaves (21 by 28 centimeters), in European paper, three are lost (between pp. 8–9, 44–45, and 46–47).Graulich, Michel. \\"Azcatitlán, Codex.\\" In David Carrasco ed. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures vol 1. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 66- 68 In 1995, the FNL collaborated with the Society of the Americas to provide a publicly available color copy of the codex. The first historian to write a detailed study of the Azcatitlan Codex was Robert H. Barlow in the mid-20th century. Barlow proposed the idea that the manuscript was produced by two authors and that the senior among them produced its beginning and then the Imperial and post-Conquest history. A decade later, Donald Robertson challenged the proposition that the senior tlacuiloque produced the colonial history segments by himself. Content Codex Azcatitlan is divided into four sections, but records in one narrative the history of the Mexica people from their migration from Aztlán to about 1527, just after the death of Cuauhtémoc. The first portion of the codex is an annal of the Mexica migration from Aztlán that asserts the role of the Tlatelolca Mexica, putting them in parity to the Tenochca Mexica. As the reigning Tenocha Mexica suppressed the identity of the Tlatelolca Mexica from 1473, this would not have been possible under the Aztec Empire. The second segment recounts the history of the Aztec Empire, depicting the reigns of each of its tlatoani in two-page spreads. The third segment details the Conquest and breaks with the traditional format of displaying the time and place of important events and only depicts the events themselves. This segment is thought to have once numbered, with the fourth, four two-page spreads. The final segment displays earlier colonial Mexican history and is broken into vertical columns that run from left to right. The glosses, in alphabetic Nahuatl, appear mostly in the migration segment to describe places and characters, though they occasionally help translate the year glyphs for readers not familiar with pre-Conquest Aztec writing. These glosses appear in small number in the Imperial segment, and then never again. =Migration segment= sacrifice of Copil to Huitzilopochtli, which marks the foundation of Tenochtitlan This segment has, unlike earlier manuscripts such as the Boturini Codex, depictions of the migration, such as their stops at sources of fresh water, getting lost, building temples, and attacks by wild animals. The tlacuiloque record every year of the migration, grouping year blocks to designate the amount of time spent at a location. Aztlán, as it is depicted in Codex Azcatitlan, strongly asserts the role of the Tlatelolca in the history of the Mexica. The island city is shown divided in two parts, like Tenochtitlan and Tlateloco. It is also shown with four \\"house\\" glyphs, referencing Tenochtitlan's four neighborhoods. The hill upon the island may also be a reference to Tlateloca; Aztlán's crest (a reed above some flowing water) is not present on the hill itself but rather atop a temple, and the words that make up Tlateloco's name (, land; , hill; -co, locative suffix) best describe this view of Aztlán. The first page of the codex, folio 1 recto (1r), shows the three rulers of the Triple Alliance, sitting upon European- style thrones in native dress and holding staves of office. Unlike earlier Aztec codices, areas of shadow are used to better define the faces on the page. The migration begins on the next page, folio 1 vecto (1v), with the departure of the Azteca from their island homeland Aztlán, as commanded by their god, Huitzilopochtli, who appears nearby as a warrior in a hummingbird headdress. Also present on folio 1v is a glyph of an ant surrounded by dots and, above it, the gloss from which the codex derives its name, which reads \\"Ascatitla\\". Emerging from this glyph is a horn, yet another reference to Tlateloco, whose first ruler was the son of the tlatoani of Azcapotzalco (\\"Place of the Anthill\\"). Guided by a dark-skinned priest, they cross from Aztlán into the domain of the altepetl of Colhuacan. There the Azteca speak amongst themselves and with Huitzilopochtli. They also meet eight tribes, the Huexotzinca, Chalca, Xochimilca, Cuitlihuaca, Malinalca, Chichimeca, Tepaneca, and the Matlatzinca, who wish to accompany the Azteca on their migration. The latter agree and the nine tribes depart, led by four 'god-bearers' named Chimalma, Apanecatl, Cuauhcoatl, and Tezcacoatl, each carrying a tlaquimilolli. On folio 4v are depicted the first human sacrifices made by the Azteca to Huitzilopochtli, who names them the Mexica and gives them a bow, arrow, bow drill, and basket. The Azteca stop at Coatlicamac for two years on folio 5v. The migration segment ends on folio 6r with the arrival and stay of the Mexica at Coatepec for a period of nine years. On 12r, Copil's heart is sacrificed to Huitzilopochtli and form grows the nopal cactus marking the land Huitzilopochtli promised to the Mexica. The migration segment ends on the next page with the foundation of Tenochtitlan (left; 12v) and Tlatelolco (13r) and the selection of their respective tlatoani. Around Cuacuapitzauac, tlatoani of Tlateloco, are five figures that include his father, Tezozomoc, and other representatives of Tepanec ancestry. The two foundation scenes are separated by six men fishing and hunting in Lake Texcoco. Below the boats is a golden disk flanked by two hands. =Imperial segment= The structure of the Imperial segment is similar to contemporary Aztec codices such as the Aubin and Mexicanus codices, but especially the Mendoza Codex. The deeds of the tlatoque of Tenochtitlan are recorded in a string of events, running left to right, without any dates. This segment is not complete, as evidenced by the lack of dating and the unfinished state of the tlatoque portraits. Three glosses, the last in the codex, appear on folios 13v to 15r to elucidate some matters of Tepanec history, such as the coronation and death of Maxtla of Azcapotzalco. Most of the spreads end with the mummy of their respective tlatoani. The segment begins on folio 13v with a nopal cactus, signifying Tenochtitlan. To its right is Acamapichtli, Tenochtitlan's first tlatoani. This pattern repeats for each of the succeeding tlatoani. The first glyph Acamapochtli's right is that of Colhuacan, his home altepetl, above which is the disembodied head of Huitzilopochtli. Next are shown three conquests by the Mexica of Mixquic, Cuitlahuac, and Xochimilco for Azcapotzalco. After these is the construction of a palace or temple in Tlatelolco, where Cuacuapitzauac and three relatives appear. In the middle of the spread, Tezozomoc dies and is succeeded by Maxtla. Also depicted is the development of sustenance on Lake Texcoco by the Mexica. Finally, Acamapichtli's mummy appears at the far right side of the spread. The depictions of Acamapichtli (13v) and Axayacatl (18v) are the only fully painted portraits in the Imperial segment. The former is painted by the master tlacuilo and the latter by the apprentice. =Conquest segment= Hernán Cortés and La Malinche leading the Spanish army on folio 22v The Conquest segment is also incomplete, lacks any dating whatsoever, and contains no glosses. Its content focuses on the exploits of the Tlateloca warrior Ecatl, known in Spanish as Don Martín. The segment has strong narrative similarity to other indigenous accounts of the Conquest, namely book 12 of the Florentine Codex and the Annals of Tlateloco. The master tlacuilo of the Azcatitlan Codex minimize native defeats and maximize their victories. This segment once contained four two-page spreads, but two have been lost. The segment begins on folio 22v with Hernán Cortés and La Malinche as they encounter another party. Behind Cortés stands his army, rendered as eight conquistadors, an African slave, a horse, and three native men carrying supplies while Malinche translates for him. Who she speaks to is made unclear by the loss of the next page, but it is probable that the event depicted is Cortés's meeting with Moctezuma II outside Tenochtitlan on 8 November 1519. Next is folio 23r, the right half of a spread depicting the Toxcatl massacre of 1520, ordered by Pedro de Alvarado. The Templo Mayor dominates the right side of the folio while a European-style building likewise occupies the top portion. The composition of the folios recalls both the massacre and the subsequent uprising of the city against the Spanish. A warrior holding a captured Spanish standard in the middle of the square as warriors charge into battle around him. Two corpses lie on the ground next to him, as does a severed head wearing a hummingbird headdress. In front of the temple stand two drummers, one with his hands amputated. Behind them lies the body of a tlatoani upon the steps of the temple, from which two more tlatoque watch. On the opposite side of the temple, a man dressed as a hummingbird stands ready with his macuahuitl and chīmalli. On the left side of folio 23v is a Spanish ship and six armored Spaniards in the water in front of it. A native man pulls a Spaniard out while another fights a Mexica warrior armed with a Spanish sword. The fighting Spaniard holds a shield decorated with a solar image. Barlow identified him as Alvarado, or \\"Tonatiuh\\" as he was known to the Mexica. As indicated by the ship, the scene is of a failed attack in May 1521 led by Alvarado that nearly saw Cortés captured while he was attempting to save drowning Spaniards. Cortés is thought to be the Spaniard being pulled out of the water by the native man. The Mexica warrior dueling Alvarado is Ecatl, who led Tlatelolco's warriors against the Spanish and once captured a banner from Alvarado. Ecatl is distinguished from earlier warriors in the codex by his tunic's wavy pattern, shared by the waters around Aztlán and those of Tenochtitlan when the Mexica first arrived there in the earlier Migration segment. His shield is also similar in design to that of Huitzilopochtli's on folio 1v, with a quincunx that references Huitzilopochtli's reign as the Fifth Sun. These signs all identify Ecatl as a holy warrior of Huitzilopochtli. Folio 24r depicts the evacuation of Cuauhtemoc's wife Tecuichpotzin from Tenochtitlan on 31 August 1521, after the former's surrender of the city. Three boats, each seating a woman, sail along the bottom of the page. Above them, five more women stand on top of some buildings. Their clothing denote them as being wealthy, with the woman at far right possibly being Tecuichpotzin. =Post-conquest segment= Folios 24v to 25r break the established flow of narrative to present its content in two vertical columns per page. The segment begins on folio 24v with a pile of bones, representing the destruction of Tenochtitlan. Next the elite of Tlatelolco are shown leaving the city to resettle under Spanish rule beneath a glyph for Amaxac, where Cuauhtemoc surrendered. This was also the site of departure for the city's populace after the surrender in August 1521. Four native rulers sit below, representing Cuauhtemoc, Coanacoch of Texcoco, Tetlepanquetzal of Tlacopan, and Temilotl of Tlatelolco. Next, the beginning of Christianization in the 1520s is marked by a vertical line of nine friars; a tenth friar baptizes an indigenous man. Above and between the nine priests is a palo volador dance with four participants and a musician on top of the pole. Following the priests are a series of images (digging stick, wood, water) that symbolize the reconstruction of Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco as Mexico City under Tlacotl, whose name is represented by the hand grasping an animal's head. Above the construction is a representation of a battle at Colhuacan. The right half of folio 24v and all of folio 25r, recount the events of the years 1524 to 1526. Its content pertains to the events of Cortés's expedition to Honduras and his killing of Cuauhtemoc, supposedly for plotting to kill Cortés, while other Spaniards were doing likewise. The left side of folio 24r pertains to the expedition while the right concerns events back in the former Aztec Empire. The time of Cuauhtemoc's death, the ritual month of Tozoztontli, is marked by the tlacuilo in the upper-right corner of folio 24v. Below the dating glyphs is the inspiring actor of the killing, Mexicatl Cozoololtic, who accused Cuauhtemoc of plotting to kill Cortés and La Malinche. Mexicatl Cozoololtic watches from afar as a Mayan lord, possibly Paxbolonacha, brings drums out of a building for a celebration at Acallan. Following this is the hanging of the tlatoque) at Hueymollan and the appointing by Cortés of Tlacotl as governor of Tenochtitlan. Tlacotl appears in bust form, below a seated tlatoani, looking into an indigenous palace. The Tlatoani is then connected by dots to a series of glyphs marking the location of the killings and promotion. While Cortés was in Honduras, a power struggle erupted between the man he left in charge, Alonso de Estrada, and two of his other men, Gonzalo de Salazar and Pedro Almíndez Chirino. Salazar and Chirino seized Cortés's estate and then murdered his cousin Rodrigo de Paz, depicted as the corpse in the top right in the Church of San Francisco in Mexico City. With Cortés's aid, Estrada arrested Salazar and Chirino and then beheaded their supporters, as shown in the bottom left. Estrada is rendered just above this second act of killing. The final extant page of Codex Azcatitlan, folio 25v, records the arrival of Mexico's first bishop, Julián Garcés and the torture of native persons for the location of Moctezoma's treasure. The page begins with a heavily damaged rendering of a meteorological event and a death by stoning in the ritual month of Atlcahualo. Garcés and an entourage that includes a seated tlatoani cover the upper half of the page and a mounted woman in the bottom left corner. The indigenous man is either the governor of Tenochtitlan or Tlatelolco, while the other members of the entourage are denoted as being of high status by their umbrellas. The woman in the bottom left is thought to be María Estrada, a member of Cortés's original expedition. On the lower half of the page, a Spaniard approaches two corpses tied to stakes that separate him from a chest.

It was the last own production of the company, in 2002 the internal development department was dissolved.  Storyline  The player character, Melvin, must save the world of Gothos from destruction. The people of Gothos are split into two types, the magic using Dreamers, and the technological Steamers. Melvin is half Dreamer, half Steamer. Melvin starts in his hometown of Dreamertown, when it is attacked by monsters. He is blamed, and taken to trial to be exiled. His uncle then teaches him the \\"basics\\", pending Melvin's exile. This section serves as the tutorial stage. After this Melvin leaves Dreamertown and heads to Steamertown, on his adventure to find his father. After passing Steamertown, Melvin enters a huge underground labyrinth called \\"The Hive\\", where his father vanished during an expedition. The Hive is a vast network built by the former rulers of Gothos. It contains grave complexes, libraries and laboratories; Melvin finds the first crystal of eternity there. When he leaves the Hive, he steps into the Great Forest, the realm of the fairies. They suffer from goblin uproars which are stopped by Melvin who then joins a pair of Shach traders on their journey to the canyon. Here, Melvin encounters Dagomar for the first time, the last survivor of the former rulers of Gothos. He acts as Melvin's mentor and guide. Also, Melvin befriends Talis, a girl who lives in exile because she also is half Dreamer, half Steamer. After clearing the canyon's mines, they travel to the tower, the former rulers' fortress of knowledge, which is now haunted by an undead dragon. As Melvin kills the dragon, another dragon is freed who takes Melvin to the volcano, which is where the Shach traders live. In the deeper levels of the volcano's caves, Melvin discovers more artifacts and buildings from the former rulers, as well as a map which leads him, Talis and the dragon to the ancient ruins of the former capital of Gothos. Here, Dagomar drops his disguise and Melvin has to find out that Dagomar is Ramogad, the traitor who led to the downfall of the former rulers. After a big fight against Ramogad, Melvin uses the crystals of eternity found in the different regions of Gothos to reactivate both a stasis trap to stop Ramogad and a barrier device which uses a magic liquid to shield Gothos from the demon realms below. Talis then helps Melvin to escape the collapsing ruins and they fly across the ocean towards the sun.

Biography Gass was a nephew of J. J. Bradshaw, the founder of Bradshaw Gass & Hope. He received the Ashbury Prize for Civil Engineering at Owens College (later Manchester University). He assisted Sir Ernest George in London, before becoming a pupil of his uncle in Bolton in 1880. In 1882, when Gass became a partner, the firm adopted the style Bradshaw & Gass. Like Sir Edwin Lutyens, another traditionalist and pupil of Ernest George, Gass designed country houses in period and vernacular styles. From 1917 to 1925 Gass designed the Methodist College at Medak in Andhra Pradesh, south India; which, like Lutyens’ work at New Delhi, is organised in the grand manner around a central axis. Gass was also a keen watercolour artist, and first exhibited his work at the Royal Academy in 1879. In later life, when he had less architectural input at Bradshaw Gass & Hope, he frequently travelled and he filled more than twenty albums with his sketches of North Africa and Asia.

He served as United States Attorney with five years of service from 2001 to 2006 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Career Cummins was born in Enid, Oklahoma. After graduating from the University of Arkansas, he eventually moved to Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1989, he obtained a J.D. degree from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock William H. Bowen School of Law. Subsequently, he served as a law clerk for United States Magistrate Judge John F. Forster, and later was clerk to chief United States District Judge Stephen M. Reasoner. After his federal clerkships, he set up a private law practice. In 1996, he ran as a Republican for Congress, losing roughly 52 percent to 48 percent, to Democrat Vic Snyder. He later served as Governor Mike Huckabee's chief legal counsel. In 2000, he was an elector representing the Arkanas's second electoral district at the electoral college and cast his vote for George W. Bush. In 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush nominated Cummins as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, a position that he held until 2006. During his tenure as U.S. Attorney, his office successfully investigated and prosecuted several high-profile cases including the conviction of a group responsible for the largest theft of electronic personal identity data up to that time. After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office, Cummins re-entered private practice, specializing in white collar criminal matters, complex multi-party litigation, and compliance. His firm provides compliance services to state regulated cannabis cultivation and dispensary companies. In 2017, Cummins joined Avenue Strategies, a consulting, advocacy, public affairs and management group in Washington D.C. Cummins now practices as both a lawyer and a lobbyist, also represents DOJ white collar targets in the U.S. or international clients targeted by DOJ or the Treasury Department. In 2015, Cummins re-entered the political arena when he agreed to serve as the Arkansas Chairman for the presidential campaign of Governor Chris Christie. Cummins and Christie served together as U.S. Attorneys during the George W. Bush administration. After Christie withdrew from the 2016 presidential primary race, Cummins subsequently agreed to serve as Arkansas Chairman of the Donald J. Trump presidential campaign. Cummins served as a Trump Whip at the Republican National Convention, held in Cleveland in July 2016. In September 2016, Cummins temporarily relocated to Washington, DC to serve on the Trump presidential transition team.  Controversy over dismissal Cummins received national attention when he was dismissed by United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales despite having received positive job reviews. Cummins was informed in June 2006 that his resignation would be desired, and as part of the transition, his replacement, Tim Griffin, had worked for Cummins' office as a special assistant United States attorney since September 2006 onward.

Cummins, apparently, \\"was ousted after Harriet E.

In response to inquiries from reporters with TPM and ABC News, Cummins confirmed that as early as October 2018 he had acted \\"as an intermediary between certain Ukrainian interests and federal law enforcement.\\" This role came up in a letter sent by Rudy Giuliani to Senator Lindsey Graham on the previous day (November 23, 2019), and although Giuliani did not name him, Cummins confirmed that he was the intermediary referred to in Giuliani's letter. Cummins noted to the reporters that he had not vetted the Ukrainian interests who contacted him, who he declined to name. He further noted that, in his communication to Manhattan U.S. attorney (SDNY) Geoffrey Berman, he asserted that he couldn't vouch for the veracity of the Ukrainian information, but was passing it along as a matter he considered appropriate for further investigation by an appropriate Federal law enforcement agency. Cummins noted that he took no further actions in this matter once Giuliani's role became public.

Career Bogdan Musiał was born in 1960 in Wielopole, Dąbrowa County, Poland. He worked in Silesian mines and worked with the Polish Solidarność movement. On account of the latter involvement, he was persecuted by state security and in 1985 sought and received political asylum in the Federal Republic of Germany; in 1992 he was naturalized. He worked as a mechanic, and from 1990 to 1998 studied history, political science and sociology at the Leibniz University of Hannover and the University of Manchester. In 1998 he graduated with a thesis on the treatment of Jews in occupied Poland. From 1991 to 1998, Musiał received a scholarship from Friedrich Ebert Foundation. During that time he was one of the main critics of the Wehrmachtsausstellung exhibition compiled by the Hamburg Institute for Social Research, which eventually had to be seriously revised before reopening to conform with his findings. Since 1998 he served as scientific researcher at the German Historical Institute in Warsaw where he has studied previously inaccessible sources about crimes of the Soviet NKVD, during the Soviet retreat in 1941 which escalated violence.Bogdan Musial, Konterrevolutionäre Elemente sind zu erschießen. Die Brutalisierung des deutsch-sowjetischen Krieges im Sommer 1941, Propyläen Verlag, Berlin 2000, . He habilitated in 2005. In 2008 he published the book Kampfplatz Deutschland. 2010-2015 he lived in Poland and worked at the Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw.  Lustration activities  In 2007 Musiał wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that Zygmunt Bauman was a former agent for Poland's Urzad Bezpieczenstwa (communist secret police) between 1945 and 1953 and had participated in political cleansing of opponents. Bauman responded that he would not dignify Musiał with an answer as \\"I don't want to give weight or importance to something which is [composed of] half-truths and 100% lies. What is true in his article is not new, because everybody knew I was a communist.\\"Professor with a past, Guardian, Aida Edemariam, 2007The Sociology of Zygmunt Bauman: Challenges and Critique, Michael Hviid Jacobsen, page 6, 2008Zygmunt Bauman: Why Good People Do Bad Things, Shaun Best, page 12, 2013 Prior research by Piotr Gontarczyk showed that Bauman had indeed been a political officer and a secret informant of the communist authorities and had received awards from the communist government for fighting Polish democratic and independence movements.Piotr Gontarczyk, \\"Towarzysz Semjon: Nieznany życiorys Zygmunta Baumana\\", Biuletyn Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej (Bullentin of the Institute of National Remembrance), no. 6 (65), June 2006, dok. [document] 2. In 2008 Musiał published a controversial article in Rzeczpospolita alleging that the father of Polish historian Włodzimierz Borodziej—who had advocated for new research into the flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II—had been an officer in the Służba Bezpieczeństwa and had arranged for Borodziej's position on the German- Polish Textbook Commission, which per Musiał tarnished Borodziej's credibility as a historian.Post-Communist Poland – Contested Pasts and Future Identities, Ewa Ochman, page 172Innocent Stalin and bad Poles, Rzeczpospolita, May 2008, Bogdan MusiałHow did the Institute of National Remembrance arrange for prof.

Musial argued that the book underestimates the number of Jewish survivors while inflating the number of complicit Poles, and that statements made by Poles are criticized while those of Jewish witnesses are not. Concerning the international outcry over the 2018 Amendment to Poland's Act on the Institute of National Remembrance, Musiał says that memory of the Holocaust serves Israel as a central motif of national identity—as a foundation myth, a substitute religion that has supplanted Judaism in an increasingly secularized world, and as an element that integrates the Jewish diaspora, particularly in the United States. Musiał states that it is hard to deny that Jews suffered in an exceptional and special way that makes their experience unique, especially in view of what he describes as the \\"horrific scale\\" of the Nazi genocide. According to Musiał, the exaggerated complicity of Poles in the Holocaust has become part of this religion, and therefore Israelis are outraged over the Polish Amendment on a basis of emotion rather than of historical facts. Musiał disagrees with attempts to show all Poles as co-responsible for the Holocaust.The Dark Return of Polish Anti-Semitism, Commentary magazine, Ben Cohen, 16 Feb 2018The Holocaust as a \\"substitute religion\\".

Machcewicz said, \\"Discrediting the people who co-created the museum by attacking their parents... is so morally repugnant that it is actually not worth commenting on.\\" Reviews Yehuda Bauer reviewed Musiał's Sowjetische Partisanen: Mythos und Wirklichkeit, 1941-1944, calling it “a most important contribution” to the history of the war, the Soviet partisans, and Polish-Jewish partisan relations in Belorussia. Karel Berkhoff stated that the book will likely remain a comprehensive description of partisan warfare in Belarus due to its large source base. Berkhoff highlighted the book's key finding that the Soviet Partisans acted \\"more or less independently from Moscow\\", and were never fully controlled by the NKVD. As a result, in the zones controlled by the Soviet partisans, they frequently robbed the local peasants, attacked Jews, assaulted women, beat and killed locals and on some occasions destroyed entire villages. Professor Zdzisław Winnicki reviewed Musial's book on Soviet partisans, calling it an \\"impressive and pioneering work\\", with \\"incredibly valuable assessments\\" about the combat effectiveness of Soviet partisan units and their infiltration by the NKVD. Winnicki concludes that Musial's work is a mature, objective study that helps us understand not only past events but also current views and attitudes in Belarus.Zdzisław J. Winnicki, \\"Sowieccy partyzanci 1941-1944. Mity i rzeczywistość, by Bogdan Musiał, Warszawa, 2014\\": [review in] Wschodnioznawstwo 8, Instytut Studiów Międzynarodowych Uniwersytetu Wrocławskiego, 363-377, pp. 365, 377. Per Anders Rudling, reviewed “Konterrevolutionäre Elemente sind zu erschießen”: Die Brutalisieung des deutsch-sowjetischen Krieges im Sommer 1941. (“Counter-revolutionary Elements are to be Shot”: The Brutalization of the German-Soviet War in the Summer of 1941). He noted that Musiał predicted in his introduction that \\"German liberal intellectuals are not going to like his book for political reasons\\" because \\"the sensitiveness surrounding the subject of the Holocaust and the National Socialist past has often worked as a block to a scholarly approach to the subject\\". Musiał places responsibility for the outbreak of World War II both on Germany and on the Soviet Union. According to Rudling Musiał makes use of \\"controversial statistics, aimed at pointing out that Poles were singled out and subjected to uniquely harsh terror under Stalin\\". Rudling concludes by saying that \\"By focusing on these tragic events, the book has stirred up a debate.Rudling, Per Anders. \\"Bogdan Musial and the Question of Jewish Responsibility for the Pogroms in Lviv in the Summer of 1941.\\" East European Jewish Affairs 35.1 (2005): 69-89. Wolfram Wette wrote that the book is full of contradictions and confuses perpetrators and victims. According to Wette the parts of the books describing the Soviet occupation of Eastern Poland contain interesting information, however Musiał's assertion that \\"Between 1939 and 1941 ... Soviet terror in eastern Poland was comparable to Nazi terror in German-occupied Poland, if not worse.\\" anticipates his findings that are affected by a \\"specifically Polish anti-Sovietism\\" attitude.Bogdan Musial: Konterrevolutionäre Elemente sind zu erschießen. Die Brutalisierung des deutsch-sowjetischen Krieges im Sommer 1941 (review), Wolfram Wette Nun tritt er mit einem Buch an die Öffentlichkeit, über das man nur den Kopf schütteln kann. Es steckt voller Widersprüche. Schon der Titel lässt das Verquere der Argumentation ahnen. (Bogdan Musiał sees himself today as the hero who has caused the Hamburg Wehrmacht exhibition to be withdrawn for revision. Now he comes to the public with a book about which one can only shake his head. It is full of contradictions. Even the title suggests the oddness of the argumentation.) ... Hier erkennt man unschwer die - von einem spezifisch polnischen Antisowjetismus vorgeprägte - Einstellung des Autors. (Here one can easily recognize the author's attitude, which is predestined by a specifically Polish anti-Sovietism.).... Im letzten problematischen Drittel seines Buches spielt Musial mit der provozierenden These, die Brutalisierung des deutsch- sowjetischen Krieges im Sommer 1941 könne als eine Reaktion auf die konkrete Konfrontation deutscher Soldaten mit den Gefangenenmorden des NKWD erklärt werden. Hier wird eindeutig die Chronologie außer Kraft gesetzt und ein Nebenaspekt zur Hauptsache erklärt. Mehrfach entsteht der Eindruck, dass hier in leichtfertiger Weise Täter und Opfer verwechselt werden. (In the last problematic third of his book Musial plays with the provocative thesis that the brutalization of the German-Soviet war in the summer of 1941 could be explained as a reaction to the concrete confrontation of German soldiers with the prisoner murders of the NKVD. Here, the chronology is clearly overridden and a secondary aspect explained to the main point. Several times the impression arises that perpetrators and victims are easily confused here.) Alexander B. Rossino states that Musiał's research is detailed and has resulted in a more nuanced understanding of Jewish involvement with Soviet occupation forces. Rossino underlines that while Musiał has been criticized for claiming that Jews in eastern Poland were over represented in Soviet institutions, examination of witness reports discovered in many cases Jewish militia members directly participated in mass arrests and deportation actions. Rossino writes that other scholars of the final solution in the occupied Soviet Union have corroborated Musiał's findings. He names among them Yitzhak Arad who wrote that Jews played a relatively large role in the Communist Party that was behind actions in occupied Poland. Other scholars include Dov Levin who wrote \\"the labeling of the Soviet administration as a 'Jewish regime' became widespread when Jewish militiamen helped NKVD agents send local Poles into exile\\". Rossino names also Jan Gross who according to him wrote in 1983 that \\"Jewish collaboration\\" with the Soviet authorities was behind the sudden upsurge of anti-Semitism among the non-Jewish population in eastern Poland.

In other words, the lower judgment was right, but for the wrong reason. The colorful \\"tipsy coachman\\" label comes from a 19th-century Georgia case, Lee v. Porter, 63 Ga 345, 346 (1879), in which the Georgia Supreme Court, noting that the \\"human mind is so constituted that in many instances it finds the truth when wholly unable to find the way that leads to it,\\" quoted from Oliver Goldsmith's Retaliation: A Poem written in 1774: :Here, waiter, more wine, let me sit while I'm able, :'Till all my companions sink under the table; :Then, with chaos and blunders encircling my head, :Let me ponder, and tell what I think of the dead. : ... :Here lies honest William, whose heart was a mint, :While the owner ne'er knew half the good that was in't; :The pupil of impulse, it forced him along, :His conduct still right, with his argument wrong; :Still aiming at honour, yet fearing to roam, :The coachman was tipsy, the chariot drove home; :Would you ask for his merits, alas! he had none, :What was good was spontaneous, his faults were his own. The Florida Supreme Court explained the doctrine in a 2002 appeal from a second-degree murder conviction: “We start with the proposition that generally, if a claim is not raised in the [trial] court, it will not be considered on appeal. However, notwithstanding this principle, in some circumstances, even though a trial court's ruling is based on improper reasoning, the ruling will be upheld if there is any theory or principle of law in the record which would support the ruling. [¶] This longstanding principle of appellate law, sometimes referred to as the ‘tipsy coachman’ doctrine, allows an appellate court to affirm a trial court that reaches the right result but for the wrong reasons so long as there is any basis which would support the judgment in the record.\\" Robertson v.

The football side is part of a sports club that also has departments for gymnastics and chess. __TOC__ History The earliest roots of the association go back to the founding of the football club Neustrelitzer Fußball Club which soon grew into a more general sports club known as Neustrelitzer Sportverein. The sports club failed after 1919, but the football department immediately re-established themselves as Ballspielverein Neustrelitz. A second local football club known as SV Viktoria Neustrelitz was formed in 1925 and was joined by BV the following year. Viktoria in turn merged with SG Corso Neustrelitz in 1931 to form SG Corso Viktoria Neustrelitz which played through to the end of World War II when occupying Allied authorities ordered all organizations in the country, including sports and football associations, disbanded. A successor was created in 1946 as SG Neustrelitz, and as was common in East Germany at the time, would undergo several name changes playing variously as BSG Konsum Neustrelitz (1949), BSG Empor Süd Neustrelitz (1951), BSG Motor Neustrelitz (1952), and BSG Maschinelles Rechnen Neustrelitz (1971). The club took on its current name in 1975 after being disassociated from its industrial sponsor. The club made several ascents to the second division DDR-Liga, but was never able to firmly establish itself at that level of play. In 1963 it appeared that BSG had won its way through a playoff round to the DDR-Liga, but found itself disqualified over the use of an ineligible player. After being promoted in 1964 Neutrelitz would play its way to the 1/8 final of the East German Cup despite a last place finish in regular league competition. The team lost a close contest there by a score of 1:2 to FC Carl Zeiss Jena. After German re-unification in 1990 TSG played in the Landesliga Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (VI) winning promotion to the Verbandsliga Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in 1996. They immediately claimed the title there, again winning promotion, this time to the NOFV- Oberliga Nord (IV). They struggled through three seasons at that level and after a 16th-place finish were demoted to the Verbandliga where they spent two years. Neutrelitz re-claimed a place in the Oberliga in 2002. Ten years later Neustrelitz reached the re-formed Regionalliga Nordost, which they won in 2014, but missed promotion to the 3.

About 6 miles (10 km) southwest of the city centre, it overlooks the bay. History =Initial design= It was designed in the early 1600s by Battista Antonelli (also known as Juan Battista Antonelli), a member of a Milanese family of military engineers, on behalf of the governor of the city, Pedro de la Roca de Borja, as a defense against raiding pirates, although an earlier, smaller, fortification had been built between 1590 and 1610. Antonelli design was adapted to the situation of the fortress on the steep sides of the promontory (the morro from which the fortress gets its name) reaching into the bay. It was constructed on a series of terraces; there were four main levels and three large bulwarks to house the artillery. Supplies would be delivered by sea and then stored in the large warehouse, which was cut directly into the rock, or transported up to the top level which housed the citadel. Construction of the citadel took 62 years, starting in 1638 and finally being completed in 1700, though work on the fortification was spasmodic. Antonelli was recalled to Cuba in 1598, shortly after the massive project was started, and other examples of his work can be seen there in the twin forts of Fuerte del Cojimar and Torreón de la Chorrera (Fuerte de Santa Doratea de Luna de Chorrera). Some of the structures from the earlier fortification were later incorporated into the main structure. =Further construction= View over the bay from the fortress The fear of pirate attacks was well-founded. While the fortress was still being constructed in 1662, English freebooters under the guidance of Christopher Myngs took control of Santiago for two weeks and during their stay destroyed part of the fortification and captured the artillery. After they departed, the Spanish government ordered the reconstruction of the damaged part of the fortress and raised the garrison to 300 men. Between 1663 and 1669 the engineers Juan Císcara Ibáñez, Juan Císcara Ramirez and Francisco Perez worked on repairing the damage and improving the fortifications, strengthening the flanks and constructing a new artillery platform. In 1678 it frustrated the attack of a French squadron and in 1680 fought off another attack by 800 men led by Franquesma, the second-in-command of the Antilles filibusters. Between 1675 and 1692 the fortress was damaged by a series of earthquakes and reconstruction had to be carried out under the direction of Francisco Pérez between 1693 and 1695. From 1738–1740 further work was undertaken by the engineer Antonio de Arredondo, who enlarged the citadel and completed some of the unfinished platforms, with Juan Martín Cermeño and Francisco Calderín making the final changes to the structure after it was again damaged by earthquakes between 1757 and 1766. By 1775, the fear of attack had diminished, and the parts of fortress known as the Rock (la Roca) and the Star (la Estrella) were converted into a prison for political prisoners, although the rest of the fortress continued to serve as a military base. It was again used as a fortress in 1898 when the United States' fleet attacked Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish–American War. =World Heritage Site= During the 20th century the Rock fell into decay, but it was restored during the 1960s by Francisco Prat Puig. The fortress was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, cited as the best preserved and most complete example of Spanish- American military architecture.

Intuitively, soldering expresses in abstract terms the idea that a manifold may have a point of contact with a certain model Klein geometry at each point. In extrinsic differential geometry, the soldering is simply expressed by the tangency of the model space to the manifold. In intrinsic geometry, other techniques are needed to express it. Soldering was introduced in this general form by Charles Ehresmann in 1950.Kobayashi (1957). Soldering of a fibre bundle Let M be a smooth manifold, and G a Lie group, and let E be a smooth fibre bundle over M with structure group G. Suppose that G acts transitively on the typical fibre F of E, and that dim F = dim M. A soldering of E to M consists of the following data: # A distinguished section o : M → E. # A linear isomorphism of vector bundles θ : TM → o*VE from the tangent bundle of M to the pullback of the vertical bundle of E along the distinguished section. In particular, this latter condition can be interpreted as saying that θ determines a linear isomorphism :\\\\theta_x : T_xM\\\\rightarrow V_{o(x)} E from the tangent space of M at x to the (vertical) tangent space of the fibre at the point determined by the distinguished section. The form θ is called the solder form for the soldering. Special cases By convention, whenever the choice of soldering is unique or canonically determined, the solder form is called the canonical form, or the tautological form. =Affine bundles and vector bundles= Suppose that E is an affine vector bundle (a vector bundle without a choice of zero section). Then a soldering on E specifies first a distinguished section: that is, a choice of zero section o, so that E may be identified as a vector bundle. The solder form is then a linear isomorphism :\\\\theta\\\\colon TM \\\\to V_oE, However, for a vector bundle there is a canonical isomorphism between the vertical space at the origin and the fibre VoE ≈ E. Making this identification, the solder form is specified by a linear isomorphism :TM \\\\to E. In other words, a soldering on an affine bundle E is a choice of isomorphism of E with the tangent bundle of M. Often one speaks of a solder form on a vector bundle, where it is understood a priori that the distinguished section of the soldering is the zero section of the bundle. In this case, the structure group of the vector bundle is often implicitly enlarged by the semidirect product of GL(n) with the typical fibre of E (which is a representation of GL(n)).Cf. Kobayashi (1957) section 11 for a discussion of the companion reduction of the structure group. Examples * As a special case, for instance, the tangent bundle itself carries a canonical solder form, namely the identity. * If M has a Riemannian metric (or pseudo-Riemannian metric), then the covariant metric tensor gives an isomorphism g\\\\colon TM \\\\to T^*M from the tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle, which is a solder form. * In Hamiltonian mechanics, the solder form is known as the tautological one-form, or alternately as the Liouville one-form, the Poincaré one-form, the canonical one-form, or the symplectic potential. Applications A solder form on a vector bundle allows one to define the torsion and contorsion tensors of a connection. =Principal bundles= In the language of principal bundles, a solder form on a smooth principal G-bundle P over a smooth manifold M is a horizontal and G-equivariant differential 1-form on P with values in a linear representation V of G such that the associated bundle map from the tangent bundle TM to the associated bundle P×G V is a bundle isomorphism. (In particular, V and M must have the same dimension.) A motivating example of a solder form is the tautological or fundamental form on the frame bundle of a manifold. The reason for the name is that a solder form solders (or attaches) the abstract principal bundle to the manifold M by identifying an associated bundle with the tangent bundle. Solder forms provide a method for studying G-structures and are important in the theory of Cartan connections. The terminology and approach is particularly popular in the physics literature.

CVI enhances our understanding of the immune response in health and disease by showcasing important clinically relevant research, including new animal models for human immunologic diseases, viral immunology, immunopathogenesis, and clinical laboratory immunology. In particular, the journal highlights important discoveries in immunization and vaccine research, such as the development and evaluation of vaccines, human and animal immune responses to vaccines, vaccine vectors, adjuvants and immunomodulators, quantitative assays of vaccine efficacy, and clinical trials. The journal publishes primary research articles, editorials, commentaries, minireviews, and case reports. Articles are freely accessible after 6 months (delayed open access). Through its \\"Global Outreach Program,\\" free online access is available to qualified microbiologists in eligible developing countries.  History  Clinical and Vaccine Immunology (CVI) was originally launched in 1994 as Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology. Dr. Steven D. Douglas was the Founding Editor and served as Editor in Chief until 2004. The focus and intent of the journal was to serve the new ASM Division V, Clinical and Diagnostic Immunology. Dr. Douglas was succeeded by Dr. Susan F. Plaeger, CVI’s Editor in Chief until 2013. Under Dr. Plaeger’s leadership, and in response to ASM members’ feedback, the journal expanded its scope to include the growing field of veterinary and human vaccines. In 2006, the ASM Publications Board approved the new name Clinical and Vaccine Immunology, to reflect the inclusion of vaccine research as well as clinical immunology. The reorganization allowed CVI to attract high-quality research papers in the areas of clinical immunology and vaccinology while maintaining its interest in laboratory immunology and diagnostics. Since then, the journal has enjoyed a sustained increase in citations and impact factor. Areas of interest for CVI include microbial immunology, clinical immunology and immune mechanisms (in health and disease), veterinary immunology, and all aspects of vaccine research: development and evaluation, adjuvants, immune modulators and antigen-delivery systems, vaccine implementation, and clinical trials. The journal serves ASM members and the broad research community with the high scientific and editorial standards of the ASM Journals and the society itself. It has been named a Rising Star among journals in the field of Immunology in Essential Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters for several months during 2010 and 2011.

He was convicted in 2003 for possessing 20 pornographic images of children, without having met or abused any of them ever. He is currently serving a sentence of 200 years in prison without possibility of probation, parole, pardon or clemency. This sentence, which was the minimum available under Arizona law,Arizona Revised Statute §13-705 and 13-3553 was upheld by the Arizona Supreme Court in 2006.State of Arizona v. Morton Robert Berger On February 26, 2007 the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear a further appeal.BBC NEWS  Americas  US 200-year porn sentence stands It is an extreme case of mandatory minimum abuse. The crime Berger was a popular history teacher at Cortez High School in Phoenix. In June 2002, police got a tip that his credit card number had been used to buy pornographic images from a site hosted in Dallas. A raid on his home revealed a large collection of child pornography that he had collected over the previous six years. He was a member of the Wonderland Club porn-trading ring that required members to have at least 10,000 images in order to join.Hoffman, Sybil. Examining Ariz. laws on child porn through the eyes of an offender . KTVK, 2012-03-05. He was charged with 35 specimen counts of sexual exploitation of a minor, each charge relating to one image. After Berger turned down a plea bargain, prosecutors dropped 15 of the charges to avoid overwhelming the jury with lewd images. In January 2003, a jury convicted Berger of the remaining 20 counts against him. The sentence Berger was convicted of second-degree dangerous crime against children, which carries a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison. Arizona has some of the strictest laws in the nation on child abuse and exploitation. Only five states have a longer minimum sentence for possession of child pornography. Arizona's 10-year minimum is longer than the maximum for this offense (or its equivalent) in 35 states, and equal to the maximum in nine states.Kilpatrick, James J. Morton Berger gets 200 years in jail for 20 dirty pictures. Universal Press Syndicate, 2006-10-04. Under federal sentencing guidelines of the day, he would have faced a minimum of only five years in prison. The sentencing judge agreed with prosecutors that since the possession of each image was a separate crime, the sentences had to run consecutively. She thus sentenced Berger to the minimum sentence available, 200 years in prison—10 years per count. Prosecutors recommended a minimum sentence of 340 years (17 years per count), while the maximum sentence available was 480 years (24 years per count). Under Arizona law, his sentence was to be served without possibility of probation, parole, pardon or clemency. Thus, all three sentences would have assured that Berger would die in prison. The appeals Berger's lawyers appealed the sentence, citing the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\". They argued that although each 10-year sentence was not too long in itself, the cumulative total of 200 years was grossly disproportionate to Berger's conduct overall, given that it was a longer sentence than those imposed for murder or rape of a child in Arizona. They also cited Berger's lack of a prior criminal record. The Arizona Court of Appeals upheld the sentence, feeling bound by precedent to do so. Judge Donn Kessler concurred in part and dissented in part, believing that Berger should have gotten a new sentencing hearing.Arizona v. Berger from Arizona Court of Appeals Berger then appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court, which ruled on May 10, 2006. Some of the justices were sympathetic to Berger's arguments. Vice Chief Justice Rebecca Berch described the mandatory minimum and consecutive sentencing rules, as well as the exclusion of probation, parole or pardon as a \\"triple whammy,\\"State of Arizona v. Morton Robert Berger, para. 70 observing that \\"it far exceeds the sentence imposed for similar crimes in any jurisdiction and exceeds the penalties regularly imposed in Arizona for crimes that result in serious bodily injury or even death to victims.\\"Para. 77 Despite its reservations, however, the court considered itself bound by precedent to uphold the sentence, saying that consecutive sentences which add up to very long sentences are not unconstitutional, provided that each of the individual sentences which comprise it are not themselves unconstitutional. The decision was virtually unanimous, with Berch concurring in part and dissenting in part. On February 26, 2007, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear a further appeal. In 2011, Berger petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Arizona for a writ of habeas corpus as a last-ditch effort to have his sentence overturned. The petition was denied.

An example of a vector-based window, found in a privately funded vector-based graphical user interface research project. 2D GUI. All window decorations and elements inside them are vector-based, the background is generated from multiple sine waves and the shapes are defined in-runtime. The final image is rasterized, anti-aliased and optionally composited, here the compositing is disabled. Pros and cons The benefits of a completely vector-based graphical user interface would include: :*more efficient, independent scalability; The resolution (measured in dots per inch or DPI) could be set higher or lower than 1px:1px without causing pixelation, enabling better use of high resolution monitors. Cons might include: :*Difficulty integrating raster-based applications. With some effort, this could be accomplished by texturing the entire raster-based application to a vector- based plane (though the disadvantages of raster-based graphics would still stand). :*Slower rendering, greater system requirements. Because today's monitors display only raster-based information, the vector information would have to be rasterized (and optionally anti-aliased) before appearing. Usage in 3D graphical user interfaces Since current 3D Graphics are usually vector-based, rather than raster-based, vector-based graphical user interfaces would be suitable for 3D graphical user interfaces. This is because raster- based 3D models take up an enormous amount of memory, as they are stored and displayed using voxels. Current operating systems such as Windows Vista, Mac OS X, and UNIX-based operating systems (including Linux) have enjoyed much benefit from using 3D graphical user interfaces. In Windows Vista, for example, Flip3D textures each window to a 3D plane based on vector graphics. Even though the window itself is still raster-based, the plane onto which it is textured is vector-based. As a result, the windows, when rotated, appear flat. In Linux desktops, Compiz Fusion can texture each raster-based workspace onto a 3D vector-based cube. As operating systems evolve, eventually the entire window would be made from 3D vector graphics, so that when rotated, it does not appear \\"flat\\". Also, advanced lighting may make 3D graphical user interfaces more aesthetically pleasing. Usage in 2D graphical user interfaces As most computer monitors become more and more high resolution, everything displayed would be smaller. However, if the screen resolution were turned down, everything would appear pixelated. Thus, resolution independence is currently being designed to solve this problem. With raster graphics, all icons need to be extremely high resolution, so as to not appear pixelated on higher resolution screens. This may take up enormous amounts of memory, and hard disk space. If vector graphics were used instead, it could be easily scalable and never lose data nor appear pixelated. Some Graphical User Interfaces on Operating Systems such as IRIX use vector-based icons. A number of vector-based icon sets are also available for window managers such as GNOME and KDE. With Windows, applications built using Windows Presentation Foundation (which is native to Windows Vista, but can be downloaded for Windows XP and Server 2003) are vector-based and scale losslessly based on Windows DPI settings. However, even without this, it has always been possible to build applications to be DPI-aware.MSDN: How to Write High-DPI Applications Additionally, in Vista, the Desktop Window Manager detects when an app is not DPI aware and, if the computer is set to a different DPI than normal, uses bitmap scaling to render the window at a larger size.High DPI Support in Windows Vista Aero New version of AmigaOS 4.1 enhanced in 2008 its Workbench with 2D vector graphical interface based on Cairo libraries, but pragmatically integrated it with a 3D Compositing Engine based on Porter-Duff Routines.

It is owned by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission and operated by the non-profit group, The Friends of Graeme Park. It is the only surviving residence of a colonial-era Pennsylvania governor. Graeme Park was constructed in 1722 by Sir William Keith as a summer residence and alternative to his governor's mansion at Shippen House on Second and Spruce Streets in Philadelphia. The house, originally known as Fountain Low, has been largely unchanged since its construction except for a restoration by Dr. Thomas Graeme in the mid 18th century and a minor restoration by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in the 1960s. Timeline Keith House in 2010 Sir William Keith The Keith House Greame Park in 1755 Dr. Thomas Graeme =1721= Construction of the malthouse begins. A malthouse is a building in which brewers create malt by starting the germination process of barley or other grains. The malt is then used as a key ingredient in the making of beer, ale and malt liquor. This malthouse was one of several attempted commercial ventures undertaken by Sir William Keith during his term as governor of Colonial Pennsylvania. His other businesses included a copper mine located west of the Susquehanna River in disputed territory and a foundry on the Christiana River near New Castle, Delaware. The malthouse was constructed during a time of financial complications between Great Britain and her American colonies. Trade was slowed tremendously and supplies of grain were rotting on the idled ships in the colonial ports in cities like Philadelphia. Keith took advantage of the need to have the grain processed and malting the grain was a good way to preserve it for a time. =1722 or 1723= Construction on the mansion at Graeme Park begins. Graeme Park was originally called \\"Fountain Low\\" by Sir Keith. It is also known as the \\"Keith House\\" in honor of Sir William Keith its builder and first resident. Fountain Low was built on of land that Keith acquired as governor. He received the land for little or no cost as a debt payment given to the Provincial government of Pennsylvania by the estate of Samuel Carpenter who had died with a considerable debt owed to colony. Over 90 workmen worked to complete Fountain Low and its surrounding buildings. Sir Keith even got the Provincial government to extend two roads to his property in Horsham. Evidence points to the assumption that Keith rarely occupied Fountain Low. The interior of the mansion was not painted until Dr. Thomas Graeme took ownership in 1739. Governor Keith instead spent the majority of his time at the governor's mansion in Philadelphia. =1739= Dr. Thomas Graeme acquired the property at Fountain Low and renamed it \\"Graeme Park\\". Dr. Graeme was the husband of Ann Diggs who was the stepdaughter of Sir William Keith. Graeme had arrived with Keith from England in 1717 and married Ann in 1719. During his years in Pennsylvania Graeme attained a significant social status in Philadelphia. He served as the Port Physician, was a consulting physician at the Pennsylvania Hospital, was appointed as a naval officer by Governor Keith in 1719, as a Register General and Master of Chancery in 1724. Graeme also served on the Provincial Council and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Governor Keith had left Pennsylvania in 1728 and left trusteeship of his properties to his wife Lady Anne Keith and family. Dr. Thomas Graeme was one of the trustees. The estate was sold in 1738 to Joseph Turner, who then sold Fountain Low to Dr. Graeme in 1739. Graeme originally used the newly named Graeme Park as a summer residence and kept his primary residence in Carpenter's Mansion in Society Hill, Philadelphia. =1755= Dr. Graeme begins interior renovations at Graeme Park. He installed decorative devices that were common during the Georgian era, including paneling and refinished several of the interior doors. These changes remain today at Graeme Park. Dr. Graeme also commissioned the construction of an outdoor kitchen, laid out a formal garden and began a \\"Deer Park\\" to make it \\"a piece of Beauty and Ornament to a dwelling (that any English noble would be proud to have ... by his house.\\" (Letter to Thomas Penn, 1755) =1765= Dr. Thomas Graeme retires from medical practice due to deteriorating health and the death of his wife Ann. Following his retirement, Dr. Graeme began to spend a majority of his time at Graeme Park. Graeme's daughter Elizabeth assumes the role of hostess for the doctor's household. Although Graeme retired from medical work he did not retire from the Philadelphia social scene. Together with Elizabeth they hosted salons or gatherings of Philadelphia's most influential statesmen, writers and musicians. Elizabeth, herself, became a poet of some renown. Dr. Graeme also served as the President of St. Andrew's Society an organization of gentlemen Scottish immigrants in Philadelphia. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society and the American Medical Society. Dr. Graeme died of a heart attack while walking the grounds of Graeme Park on September 4, 1772. Ownership of the land was transferred to his daughter Elizabeth and her husband Henry Hugh Fergusson. =1778= Graeme Park is confiscated by the Continental Congress due to Henry Fergusson's loyalist sympathies during the American Revolution. Elizabeth Graeme married Henry Fergusson on April 21, 1772 without her father's consent. This caused quite a problem for the newlyweds. Henry and Elizabeth had been introduced to each other by Dr. Benjamin Rush, a founding father of Pennsylvania, on December 7, 1771 at one of the salons hosted by Elizabeth and Dr. Graeme. Fergusson was a recent and penniless Scottish Immigrant and he was eleven years younger than Elizabeth. Both of these qualities made him a less than ideal suitor for Elizabeth's hand in marriage and Dr. Graeme forbade that they marry. Four months after they met, Henry and Elizabeth married secretly in Old Swede's Church. Only their close friends attended, including Benjamin Rush, Provost William Smith and his wife. Despite her father's disapproval, Elizabeth had vowed to let her marriage be known. Ironically, the day on which she decided to tell him the news was the day that he suffered his fatal heart attack, with Elizabeth watching him approach Graeme Park through a window of the mansion. Elizabeth was never able to tell of her marriage. She was Dr. Graeme's only living heir, she inherited Graeme Park and by right of marriage Henry Fergusson gained title to the property. With his sudden new fortune Henry Fergusson was able to quickly ascend the Philadelphia society ladder. He traveled to England twice, became director of a prominent Philadelphia library and was awarded the title magistrate in Philadelphia. He was the last magistrate of Philadelphia under British colonial rule. He sailed once more for England in late 1775 just as the American Revolution was beginning to gather steam. He returned to Philadelphia by way of New York City as a loyalist with Sir William Howe commander of the British forces in American. With Howe, Fergusson witnessed the Battle of Brandywine and the occupation of Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign. Fergusson involved his wife in his activities by sending her as a messenger to General George Washington to ask for his surrender and to present a bribe to a major in the Continental Army. Both of these incidents caused the Patriots of Philadelphia to doubt her loyalty. There was no doubt about where Henry Fergusson's loyalties lay. He was found a traitor by the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania and Graeme Park was seized under the Confiscation Act of 1778. =1781–1795= Graeme Park is returned to Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson and she lives there in peace until 1795. Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson Elizabeth Fergusson may have delivered some letters, for her husband's sake, that called her loyalty into question, but she remained a patriot throughout the Revolution. She was able regain Graeme Park in 1781 thanks to the support of several close and influential friends. Among these were Dr. William Smith,* first president of the University of Pennsylvania, Robert Morris known as the financier of the Revolution, and Benjamin Rush, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence and the man who introduced her to Henry Fergusson. Elizabeth was able to live the rest of her life in peace and quiet. She sold Graeme Park to a pharmacist from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania named William Smith. Elizabeth lived with her friends in Horsham until her death in 1801. =1801–1920= The Penroses care for Graeme Park William Smith sold of Graeme Park to Samuel Penrose of Richland Township including the original house, Keith Mansion, in April 1801. Samuel and his wife Sarah were members of Horsham Friends Meeting, the local Quaker congregation. They were the parents of 10 children, seven of which survived to adulthood. Their son William was married to Ann Larrett in 1810 and the Penrose built a second farmhouse at Graeme Park for the newlyweds. Samuel bought all of Graeme Park from his father in 1820 and with Sarah began the tradition of keeping Graeme Park in its original state while at the same time having a productive and profitable farm. When Samuel died in 1863 ownership was transferred to his third son, Abel Penrose. Abel and his wife, Sarah Beisel, continued to preserve Graeme Park for future generations. They even began to invite visitors to take tours of the former Governor's mansion. Morris Penrose was the fourth and final generation of the Penrose family at Graeme Park, beginning in 1893. He continued the tradition of hosting tours for school groups and historical societies. It was noted that 400 visitors walked to Graeme Park from the trolley stop on Easton Road in Horsham. =1920–1958= The Strawbridges care for Graeme Park Morris Penrose sold to Welsh Strawbridge on March 20, 1920. Strawbridge was an investment broker with the firm J&W; Strawbridge. He was a prominent member of Philadelphia society, serving as Master of the Hounds for the Whitemarsh Hunt Club. Strawbridge married Miss Margaret Ely Marshall in 1922. They lived in the 1810 Penrose farmhouse and continued the Penrose tradition of preserving the Keith House and sharing its history with visitors. In order to ensure the preservation of this historic mansion, the Strawbridges donated the Keith House and the surrounding area to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1958. =1958–present= Graeme Park as a Pennsylvania Historical Site The PHMC did some minor restorative repairs to Graeme Park in the 1960s. The buildings and the grounds of Graeme Park appear in much the same state today as they did in colonial times. The original floor boards, paneling and paint from Dr. Graeme's restoration remain. They provide a glimpse into the world of Georgian architecture.  Haunting legends  Since Elizabeth's death in 1801 it has been rumored by the citizens of Horsham, Pennsylvania that the Keith House and Graeme Park are haunted by her ghost. These local legends have been embraced by The Friends of Graeme Park, who perform annual lantern tours of the Keith House. References  Further reading *H.D. Eberlein and H.M.

The lyrics are anonymous. The song is bitter-sweet, typical of Dowland who cultivated a melancholy style.Wells, Robin Headlam. \\"John Dowland and Elizabethan Melancholy,\\" Early Music, Vol. 13, No. 4. November 1985, pp. 514–28. It was included in Dowland's First Booke of Songes or Ayres, which appeared in 1597. The piece is often performed as a lute song by soloist and lute, but, like other songs in the First Booke, it is printed in a format that can also be performed as a madrigal by a small vocal group (typically SATB).  Lyrics  Come again! Sweet love doth now invite Thy graces that refrain To do me due delight, To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die, With thee again in sweetest sympathy. Come again! That I may cease to mourn Through thy unkind disdain; For now left and forlorn I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die In deadly pain and endless misery. All the day The sun that lends me shine By frowns do cause me pine And feeds me with delay; Her smiles, my springs that makes my joys to grow, Her frowns the Winters of my woe. All the night My sleeps are full of dreams, My eyes are full of streams. My heart takes no delight To see the fruits and joys that some do find And mark the storms are me assign'd. Out alas, My faith is ever true, Yet will she never rue Nor yield me any grace; Her eyes of fire, her heart of flint is made, Whom tears nor truth may once invade. Gentle Love, Draw forth thy wounding dart, Thou canst not pierce her heart; For I, that do approve By sighs and tears more hot than are thy shafts Did tempt while she for triumph laughs.  Recent performances  The Scottish tenor Paul Agnew recorded the song with Christopher Wilson (from the 2005 CD Dowland: Flow My Teares)., Paul Agnew and Christopher Wilson Sting recorded the song with lutenist Edin Karamazov for the album Songs from the Labyrinth (performed in an episode of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip). The song has also been recorded with Celtic harper Jay Michaels and vocalist Abby Michaels, the Celtic/Folk/Renaissance duo The Harper and The Minstrel, in their 2008 album Beloved Mine.

History Joel Russ, a Jewish immigrant from Poland who arrived in Manhattan around 1905, started the business to cater to the Jewish immigrants settling in the Lower East Side of New York.https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/its-not-just-food/ He began by carrying Polish Mushrooms on his shoulders, and saved enough money to purchase a pushcart. He then expanded his operation and sold pickled herring as well as Polish Mushrooms. Then in 1914, Joel Russ opened J Russ International Appetizers, a storefront around the corner from the current location. In 1920, Joel Russ opened his store at the current location of 179 East Houston Street. In 1933, he renamed the business \\"Russ and Daughters\\" after making his three daughters, Hattie, Anne, and Ida, partners in the store. Historically, businesses typically took on the name \\"and sons\\", but since Russ and his wife Bella only had daughters, his business became Russ & Daughters. However, Joel Russ was not a feminist ahead of his time. For him, getting his daughters into the business was not a matter of women's rights, but a matter of parnosa, or surviving to make a business. As he put it, he was concerned with Vi nempt men parnosa, meaning 'From where do we take our living.'The Soul of a Store. Mark Russ Federman in Gastropolis. Edited by Annie Hauk-Lawson and Jonatha Deutsch. pg. 198. Columbia University Press.

Once each one of them finished high school, they all worked full-time. Moreover, Joel Russ kept the store open seven days a week. Calvin Trillin wrote about Russ & Daughters in the 1970s in his New Yorker food pieces. In 2008 The Jews of New York documentary premiered on PBS, featuring three generations of the Russ & Daughters family (Anne Russ Federman and Hattie Russ Gold, the two surviving Russ daughters; Mark Russ Federman, then the proprietor; Niki Russ Federman; and Josh Russ Tupper.) The documentary tells, among other things, the story of Russ & Daughters from the early 1900s to the (then) present. The third daughter, Ida, had died. Russ & Daughters: Reflections and Recipes from the House That Herring Built, by Mark Russ Federman (grandson of Joel Russ), with an introduction by Calvin Trillin, was published in 2013. Russ & Daughters received the 2013 Jewish Cultural Achievement Award, making it the first restaurant to receive a Jewish Cultural Achievement Award. In 2014, The Sturgeon Queens, a documentary about Russ & Daughters, premiered. It features, among others, Anne Russ Federman, 92 years old at the time, and Hattie Russ Gold, 100 years old at the time, who were the two surviving Russ daughters.

This division contains three former Varian product lines: ICPMS systems, laboratory gas chromatography (GC), and GC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (originally designed by Bear Instruments and acquired by Varian in 2001). In 2012 it sponsored the Fritz Feigl Prize, and since 1999 the company has also sponsored the Günther Laukien Prize. History The company was founded on September 7, 1960, in Karlsruhe, Germany as Bruker-Physik AG by five people, one of them being Günther Laukien, who was a professor at the University of Karlsruhe at the time. The name Bruker originates from co- founder Emil Bruker, as Günther Laukien himself was formally not allowed to commercialize his research whilst being a professor. Bruker produced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) and EMR spectroscopy equipment then. In the early 1960s, the company had around 60 employees and was growing rapidly. One of the early success products was the HFX 90 NMR spectroscopy system, with three independent channels and which was also the first NMR system using only semiconductor transistors. In 1969, Bruker launched the first commercial Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy system (FT-NMR) and in the 1970s the company was the first to commercialize a superconducting FT-NMR. Later, the company would expand their product range with MRI, FTIR and FT-Raman spectrometers and with mass spectrometers. In 1968, Bruker shipped NMR systems to Yale University in Connecticut. After that, demand from the US grew, so Bruker opened an office in Elmsford, New York which marked the start of their US activities. In 2008 after a corporate reorganization lasting 8 years, all divisions were merged in a unified Bruker Corporation. Günther Laukien died in 1997; one of his four sons Frank Laukien, is currently the CEO of Bruker. Another son, Jörg C. Laukien, also works for the company. Another son, Dirk D. Laukien, is a former company executive.

Bruker made several offers to take over its supplier Oxford Instruments during the 1970s, but after almost a decade of negotiations, an acquisition was eventually rejected by Oxford Instruments. In 1997, the analytical X-ray division of Siemens was acquired by Bruker. In 2010, Bruker bought 3 product lines from Agilent, which Agilent had acquired from Varian. These included mass spectrometry and gas chromatography instruments. They have since divested these products to Scion Instruments with the exception of the triple quadrupole In 2012, Bruker bought parts of Carestream Health, including their in-vivo imaging portfolio and related aspects. In 2019, Bruker bought Alicona, known for production of metrology equipment based on focus variation, to extend its analytics business in the industrial market.

In German the words Schrat and Waldschrat are also used for a moss person. (Compare Old Norse skratti, \\"goblin\\".)Roscoe 1995: \\"Skratte, skratti, skrati (Old Norse) evil spirit, goblin, monster.\\" The diminutive Schrätlein also serves as synonym for a nightmare creature.Jacob Grimm: Deutsche Mythologie. Wiesbaden 2007, p. 372. They are sometimes described as similar to dwarves, being the same size as children, but \\"grey and old-looking, hairy, and clad in moss.\\"Classification as race of elves and description, Thistelton-Dyer, 1889. Sometimes, moss folk are also bigger.Jacob Grimm: Deutsche Mythologie. Wiesbaden 2007, p. 373. In other descriptions they are said to be pretty.Wolfgang Golther: Germanische Mythologie. Wiesbaden 2011, p. 197 f.  Origins  Jacob Grimm believed that Gothic skōhsl, used to translate Koine Greek δαιμόνιον (daimonion), \\"demon\\", in the New Testament, was related to Old Norse skōgr and Old English sceaga, both meaning \\"forest\\", and therefore represented a cognate of the moss people in Gothic folklore. Subsequent authors, however, have related skōhsl with English \\"shuck\\" (from Old English scucca, \\"evil spirit\\") and German Scheusal, \\"monster\\" (from Middle High German schūsel, though by folk etymology identified with scheuen, \\"to dread\\", and -sal, a noun suffix).Balg 1887: \\"Perhaps allied to O.E. scucca, sceucca (eu by influence of the palatal sc).\\"Wood 1900: \\"This may rather be connected with Goth. skōhsl for *skūhsl, M. H. G. schūsel < *skūhsla, the N. H. G. scheusal being popularly referred to scheu, O. E. scucca 'demon, devil', from *squqnó.\\"Wedgwood 1872: \\"The termination sal is frequently used in G. to form substantives from verbs; trübsal, tribulation; schicksal, lot; scheusal, an object of aversion, &c.;\\" Parallels have been drawn between the moss people and woodwoses. Early descriptions of Germanic beliefs include descriptions of \\"wood people\\" by the 6th century Roman historian Jordanes and \\"woodland women\\" by the 11th-century Rhenish bishop Burchard of Worms.Thorpe 1851: \\"Sylvestres homines, quos faunos ficarios vocant\\" (Jordanes); \\"Agrestes feminas, quas silvaticas vocant\\" (Burchard). Furthermore, Grimm recorded the terms wildiu wīp, wildero wībo, wilder wībe, wilden wībe, wildaz wīp (all meaning \\"wild wife\\") and wilde fröuwelīn (\\"wild maiden\\") from various early medieval texts.  In folklore  According to legend, these fairies would occasionally borrow items from people or ask for help but would always compensate the owners generously, often with either good advice or bread. It was, however, easy to anger such wood-sprites, either by spurning their gifts (which might be the compensations named above) or by giving them caraway bread – of which they had a particular hatred, often being heard to utter the doggerel rhyme \\"Kümmelbrot, unser Tod!\\" (\\"Caraway bread, our death!\\").Jacob Grimm: Deutsche Mythologie. Wiesbaden 2007, p. 375. In certain myths, the moss folk would ask humans for breast milk to feed their young, or steal little human childrenWolfgang Golther: Germanische Mythologie. Wiesbaden 2011, p. 197. – motifs found in changeling lore.Jacob Grimm: Deutsche Mythologie. Wiesbaden 2007, p. 1039. Moss people, especially the females of the species, are able to send plagues on one hand, but on the other can also heal the victims of such plagues. During epidemics the Holzfräulein (\\"Wood ladies\\") would emerge from the forest to show the people which medicinal herbs could cure or ward off plague. They were often but not always the object of the Wild Hunt. According to folklore, in order to escape the hunt they enter the trees that woodsmen have marked with a cross that will be chopped down.Wild Hunt information, Thistelton-Dyer, 1889. Des Knaben Wunderhorn records \\"folk-songs [that] make the huntsman in the wood start a dark-brown maid, and hail her: 'whither away, wild beast?', but his mother did not take to the bride.\\" The moss people are similar to hamadryads. Their lives are \\"attached to the trees; if any one causes by friction the inner bark to loosen a Wood-woman dies.\\"Thistelton-Dyer, 1889, quoting Thomas Keightley's \\"Fairy Mythology\\" 1850:231. According to Jacob Grimm: > \\"Between Leidhecken and Dauernheim in the Wetterau stands the high mountain, > and on it a stone, der welle fra gestoil (the wild woman's chairs); there is > an impression on the rock, as of the limbs of human sitters. The people say > the wild folk lived there 'wei di schtan noch mell warn,' while the stones > were still soft; afterwards, being persecuted, the man ran away, the wife > and child remained in custody at Dauernheim until they died.\\"Grimm 1882 The female Moss people, the Moosfräulein (\\"Moss ladies\\"), have a queen called the Buschgroßmutter (Buschgrossmutter; \\"Shrub Grandmother\\"). Ludwig Bechstein describes her in his folktale 551: > \\"According to certain tales of the peasantry, a demonic creature dwells near > Leutenberg and on the left bank of river Saale, called the Buschgroßmutter > (\\"Shrub Grandmother\\"). She has many daughters, called Moosfräuleins (\\"Moss > ladies\\"), with whom she roves around the country at certain times and upon > certain holy nights. It is not good to meet her, for she has wild, staring > eyes and crazy, unkempt hair. Often she drives around in a little cart or > waggon, and at such times it is wise to stay out of her way. Children, in > particular, are afraid of this Putzmommel (hooded, female bogey) and delight > in whispering tales of her to frighten each other. She is essentially the > same spirit as Hulda or Bertha, the Wild Huntress – to whom local tales > ascribe a following of children under the guise of the Heimchen (dwarves, > pixies, brownies, hobgoblins) who constitute her attendants in the area she > frequents.\\" (Translated from the German text)Ludwig Bechstein: Deutsches > Sagenbuch.

She played senior camogie with Tipperary and Cashel Camogie Club, winning All-Star awards in 2005 and 2006, a Lynchpin award, predecessor of the All Star awards, in 2003 and All Ireland medals in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2004. Early life Jovita Delaney was born in Boherlahan near Cashel, County Tipperary in 1974. She grew up surrounded by an atmosphere of hurling activity. Her father had played with his local club in his youth and was heavily involved in coaching the local juvenile teams. The family’s association with the game stretches back almost one hundred years as Arthur O'Donnell, a cousin, won All-Ireland medals with Tipperary in 1916 and 1925. Delaney frequently attended games with her family, however, it was not until she attended Scoil Mhuire in Cashel that she first became involved in competitive camogie. It was here that she first tasted success, winning both junior and senior Munster titles in 1989 and 1990. Unfortunately an All-Ireland title eluded her. Playing career =Club= By attending school in Cashel Delaney became involved with Cashel camogie club. Here she won several under-age titles before breaking onto the senior team in the late 1980s. The club had a great run of success at senior level, with Delaney winning county titles as a member of the forward line in 1989, 1990, 1991. By the late 1990s she had switched to the full-back line where she won a further four county medals between 1998 and 2001. Delaney added a Munster club medal in 2001, however, her side were defeated in the All-Ireland final. =Inter-county= Delaney began playing with the Tipperary minor team in 1986 at the age of twelve. Four years later she tasted her first major success when she won an All-Ireland medal at minor level. In the game itself against Kilkenny Delaney scored seven points from centre-forward. This win was particularly special as it was Tipperary’s first camogie title at any grade. Two years later in 1992 Delaney had more success when she won an All-Ireland title with the Tipperary junior team. Another All-Ireland medal followed in 1997 when the Tipperary intermediate team won the All-Ireland title following a win over Clare. She played in eight successive All Ireland finals for Tipperary winning five All Ireland medals in 1999,1999 Tipperary 0-12 Kilkenny 1-8 All Ireland final reports in Irish Examiner , Irish Independent and Irish Times also comment on reversal of League final result 2000,2000 Tipperary 2-11 Cork 1-9 All Ireland final report in Irish Times 2001,2001 Tipperary 4-13 Kilkenny 1-6 All Ireland final reports in Irish Independent and Irish Times 20032003 Tipperary 2-11 Cork 1-11 All Ireland final reports in Irish Examiner , Irish Independent, and Irish Times and 2004.2004 Tipperary 2-11 Cork 0-9 All Ireland final reports in Irish Examiner , Irish Independent, and 481 Rebelgaa.com She won her first All Ireland senior club medal with Cashel in 2007 2007 Cashel 1-18 Athenry 0-9 report in Connacht Tribune and a second against Athenry in 2009.2009 Cashel 0-11 Athenry 0-9 report in Irish Times Irish Independent, RTÉ online and Tipperary Star She was nominated for a further All Star award in 2004.524 2004 All Star nominations In 1999 she became goalkeeper on the senior team and would shortly taste major success. That year Tipperary reached their first-ever senior All-Ireland final where they faced Kilkenny. Tipp emerged victorious by a single point and Delaney claimed her first senior All-Ireland medal. In 2000 Delaney was appointed captain of Tipperary’s senior camogie team. Once again her side reached the All-Ireland final but this time the opponents were Cork. Tipp won on the day and Delaney captured her second senior All-Ireland medal. Her performance on the day earned her the RTÉ Player of the Match award. In 2001 Tipperary made it three-in-a-row following a comprehensive defeat of Kilkenny. The next five years would see Tipperary face Cork in five consecutive All-Ireland finals. Cork won in 2002, however, Delaney’s Tipperary side won back-to-back titles in 2003 and 2004. Cork emerged victorious once again in 2005 and 2006 with back- to-back victories of their own.

She is regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time, a member of the team of the century.Camogie Team of the century on camogie.ie the first camogie player to win a Caltex award in 1966,Irish Press December 16, 1966 and the Gaelic Weekly all-star award winner in 1967. Early life Úna O'Connor was born in Fairview, Dublin in 1938. The youngest of eight children, her mother died when she was just eighteen years old. O'Connor grew up in Dublin at a time when the county’s Gaelic footballers were successful. She was a great admirer of Kevin Heffernan and often received coaching advice from him before she played in big games. Playing career =Club= O'Connor played her club camogie with the Celtic club in Dublin. She enjoyed much success with Celtic, winning ten Dublin county camogie championship titles in all. She was also one of the key players when the club won the first All-Ireland club camogie championship in 1964. =Inter- county= In 1953 O'Connor won her first All-Ireland medal with Dublin. Although she was only fifteen years old, she showed exceptional talent by scoring three goals in the defeat of Tipperary. After that, O’Connor collected two additional All-Ireland medals in 1954 and 1955. In 1957 Dublin reached the All-Ireland final once again. However, O’Connor was out of favour with the management and was not in the starting line-up for the game. With Dublin struggling with ten minutes left in the game, O’Connor was brought on and showed her talent once again by scoring the winning goal. Although she was only 19, she had just won her fourth All-Ireland medal. This victory began an amazing run of success that by 1966 saw O’Connor win ten All-Ireland medals in a row. This achievement is unique to O’Connor and one that is unlikely to be ever equalled. In 1963 and 1964 she had the honour of captaining her native county to back-to-back victories. In 1967 O’Connor appeared in another All- Ireland final. However, Antrim gained revenge on Dublin by beating them in the All-Ireland final replay. In spite of this, she received the Caltex Award for best player of the year, thus becoming the first camogie player to be so honoured. In 1975 O’Connor came out of retirement to play in the Leinster championship against Wexford. Once again she showed her versatility by playing as a full-back, while she previously played as a forward. Retirement In retirement, O'Connor's reputation as one of the greatest players of all time has grown. Her haul of thirteen All-Ireland medals is a record that stands second to her county colleague Kathleen Mills, who heads the honours list with fifteen medals. In 2004 O’Connor was named in the wing-forward position on a special team picked to celebrate the centenary of Cumann Camogaíochta na nGael.

Each edition of Etiqueta Negra has a theme about which \\"accomplices\\" as Etiqueta Negra calls their contributors, submit chronicles, short stories, essays, interviews and investigative reports. The July 2006 issue on fear, according to Foreign Policy, was \\"a classic of the genre, and included an amusing debate on horror cinema, an article on vampirism, and a beautifully written essay on air travel phobia — all unrelated topics on the surface that effectively coalesced inside the pages of Etiqueta Negra\\". The magazine is considered to be the most prestigious work of narrative journalism in the Spanish-speaking world and has been compared to The New Yorker. The magazine is headquartered in Lima and is published by Pool Producciones. From its beginning in 2002, first bimonthly and then monthly, each Etiqueta Negra issue focuses on a main subject (cinema, erotism, fashion, cuisine, etc.) from several perspectives and using a number of techniques: from the photographic chronicle to the essay, from the report to the interview. Julio Villanueva Chang was the first editor-in-chief. In 2007, Etiqueta Negra co-edited and co-published the Fall 2007 issue of the Virginia Quarterly Review dedicated to South America which was nominated for the National Magazine Award.

Early life Erne was the only son of Henry William Crichton, Viscount Crichton. His mother was Lady Mary Cavendish Grosvenor. On 31 October 1914, his father, a Major (brevet Lt. Colonel) in the Royal Horse Guards, was killed in action, aged 42, during the Great War. (He was awarded a DSO and a MVO, and is buried at Zantvoorde British Cemetery in Flanders.) Only a month later, aged seven, Erne succeeded his grandfather as the fifth Earl Erne.Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition). New York: St Martin's Press, 1990. His mother later married Col. the Hon. Algernon Francis Stanley (a son of Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby), with whom she had one son and a daughter. His father was the eldest son, and heir apparent, of John Crichton, 4th Earl Erne, and Lady Florence Cole (a daughter of William Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen). His maternal grandparents were the former Hon. Katherine Cavendish (third daughter of the 2nd Baron Chesham) and Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster, who was considered to be the richest man in Britain at this death. His paternal aunt, Lady Mabel Crichton, married his maternal uncle, Lord Hugh Grosvenor, and was the mother of Gerald and Robert, the 4th and 5th Dukes of Westminster. From 1921 to 1924, he serve as Page of Honour to King George V and, later, a Lord- in-Waiting to King George VI. Career Erne trained for a military career at the Royal Military College and was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards in 1927. He was promoted Lieutenant in 1930 and resigned his commission in 1934. Becoming an active member of the House of Lords, he served as a Lord-in- waiting, or government whip in the House of Lords, from 1936 to 1939 in the National Government under Stanley Baldwin and later under Neville Chamberlain. When the Second World War broke out, he was commissioned as a Major into the Royal Horse Guards (attd. 12th Royal Lancers, Royal Armoured Corps) and in the North Irish Horse. He was killed in action on 23 May 1940 and was buried at Wormhoudt Communal Cemetery in France. Personal life On 1933, Lord Erne married Lady Davidema Katharine Cynthia Mary Millicent Bulwer-Lytton (1909–1995), daughter of Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton, and Pamela Plowden. Together, they lived at Knebworth, Hertfordshire, and were the parents of: * Lady Rosanagh Mary Crichton (1932–2019), who married Baron Michael Paul Raben-Levetzau, second son of Count Siegfried Victor Raben- Levetzau, of Denmark, in 1956. * Lady Antonia Pamela Mary Crichton (b. 1934), who married Timothy William Wardell, second son of Brig. John Michael Stewart Wardell and the former Ruth Irwin Crossley (a daughter Sir Kenneth Crossley, 2nd Baronet) in 1953. After their divorce, she married Charles William Beckwith in 1981. * Henry Crichton, 6th Earl Erne (1937–2015), who married Camilla Roberts, elder daughter of the aviator Owen Roberts (a grandson of Marshall Owen Roberts) and a cousin to The 12th Baron Farnham and second cousin to The 10th Duke of Atholl. Upon his death in 1940, aged 32, he was succeeded in his titles by his two-year-old only son Henry.

At the time it was playing in Billings, Montana performing The Melting Pot, a play by Israel Zangwill. Following a route of tented colleges, Withers first appeared on the road in Little Women. She played the leading role in The Tailor Made Man after a season in stock theatre in Utica, New York. She performed in Cappy Ricks in Chicago. George M. Cohan selected Withers for the lead feminine role, with Lowell Sherman, in the Chicago company of The Tavern. In New York City she appeared in Kempy at the Belmont Theater. While in New York Withers modeled for an exclusive gown shop during the day. Henry Duffy wired her to come to San Francisco, California to do Kempy just as she was on her way to visit her mother in Los Angeles. She made her way south acting in Love Em and Leave 'Em and Rain. Withers starred in Rain at the old Orpheum Theater, 12th Street, San Francisco, California, in November 1926. Drawing comparisons to actress Jeanne Eagels, she drew praise in the role of Sadie Thompson. Movies and television Withers accumulated ninety-two screen and television credits, beginning with a role in the movie The Hot Spot (1931). Many of her screen appearances were uncredited parts. She was also in her share of B-movies. Two memorable movies in which she had uncredited parts were The Babe Ruth Story (1948) and Monkey Business (1952).

According to Greek mythology, the fresh water fountain is the place where the nymph Arethusa, the patron figure of ancient Syracuse, returned to earth's surface after escaping from her undersea home in Arcadia.Virgil, Georgics 4.344 The fountain is mentioned in a number of works of literature, for instance John Milton’s pastoral elegy Lycidas (l. 85) and his masque Arcades, as well as Alexander Pope’s satire The Dunciad (Bk 2, l. 342) and William Wordsworth's blank verse poem The Prelude (Bk X, l. 1033). These writers would have known the fountain from references in ancient Roman and Greek sources, such as Virgil's 10th Eclogue (l. 1) and Theocritus' pastoral poem Idylls (I, l. 117). Virgil reckons the eponymous nymph as the divinity who inspired bucolic or pastoral poetry. In Moby-Dick, Herman Melville writes that waters from the fountain were said to come from the Holy Land.Melville, Herman (1851). Moby-Dick. Random House Modern Library edition, 1951.

For a random field or stochastic process Z(x) on a domain D, a covariance function C(x, y) gives the covariance of the values of the random field at the two locations x and y: :C(x,y):=\\\\operatorname{cov}(Z(x),Z(y))=\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[\\\\\\\\{Z(x)-\\\\mathbb{E}[Z(x)]\\\\\\\\}\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\{Z(y)-\\\\mathbb{E}[Z(y)]\\\\\\\\} \\\\right].\\\\, The same C(x, y) is called the autocovariance function in two instances: in time series (to denote exactly the same concept except that x and y refer to locations in time rather than in space), and in multivariate random fields (to refer to the covariance of a variable with itself, as opposed to the cross covariance between two different variables at different locations, Cov(Z(x1), Y(x2))).  Admissibility  For locations x1, x2, …, xN ∈ D the variance of every linear combination :X=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i Z(x_i) can be computed as :\\\\operatorname{var}(X)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{j=1}^N w_i C(x_i,x_j) w_j. A function is a valid covariance function if and only if this variance is non-negative for all possible choices of N and weights w1, …, wN. A function with this property is called positive definite.  Simplifications with stationarity  In case of a weakly stationary random field, where :C(x_i,x_j)=C(x_i+h,x_j+h)\\\\, for any lag h, the covariance function can be represented by a one-parameter function :C_s(h)=C(0,h)=C(x,x+h)\\\\, which is called a covariogram and also a covariance function. Implicitly the C(xi, xj) can be computed from Cs(h) by: :C(x,y)=C_s(y-x).\\\\, The positive definiteness of this single-argument version of the covariance function can be checked by Bochner's theorem.  Parametric families of covariance functions  A simple stationary parametric covariance function is the \\"exponential covariance function\\" : C(d) = \\\\exp(-d/V) where V is a scaling parameter, and d = d(x,y) is the distance between two points. Sample paths of a Gaussian process with the exponential covariance function are not smooth. The \\"squared exponential covariance function\\" : C(d) = \\\\exp(-(d/V)^2) is a stationary covariance function with smooth sample paths. The Matérn covariance function and rational quadratic covariance function are two parametric families of stationary covariance functions. The Matérn family includes the exponential and squared exponential covariance functions as special cases.

Biography James Baker Hall was born in Lexington, Kentucky in 1935. He was raised in a southern family of means and social standing, only to have a family scandal turn tragic when he was eight years old. This trauma, and its enduring consequence, would shape Hall's life work as an artist, which began when he took up photography at age eleven. Hall graduated from the University of Kentucky with a B.A. in English, having studied writing under Robert Hazel among his lifelong literary colleagues: Wendell Berry, Ed McClanahan, Gurney Norman, and Bobbie Ann Mason. In 1960, he received a Stegner Fellowship at Stanford University and shared the historic workshops in which Leaving Cheyenne (Larry McMurtry) and One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest (Ken Kesey) were being written. After his first novel, Yates Paul, His Grand Flights, His Tootings (also written in these same workshops) was published to critical acclaim, Hall returned to his roots in photography. During this time, he became the close colleague of such photographers as Minor White, Richard Benson, and Ralph Eugene Meatyard, was a contributing editor for Aperture, and lectured widely on photography in such places as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Rhode Island School of Design, the Visual Studies Workshop, and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. In 1973, Hall came back to Lexington to teach at the University of Kentucky and, for the next thirty years, would act as director of the creative writing program. In 2003, he retired as professor emeritus, having vastly influenced the next generation of Kentucky writers. Notable students include: Maurice Manning, T. Crunk, Patrick O'Keeffe, Rebecca Gayle Howell. Hall was prolific as both a writer and a visual artist, publishing widely in both arenas. In 2001, Hall was named the Poet Laureate of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.http://artscouncil.ky.gov/Poet/Poet_History.htm#Past He was married to novelist and poet Mary Ann Taylor-Hall.

About Hall's work * \\"He makes our terror come alive – and our knowledge and our joy – in his beautiful singing.\\" --Gerald Stern * \\"James Baker Hall has consistently pursued in his poetry a trajectory that is deeply authentic. It has produced writing of daring and delicacy, over a period long enough to make it plain that this is not a momentary brilliance but a sustained vision. He has been dedicated to making the language reflect the surprise, the turns and leaps of memory and recurrent apparition, in which pain and beauty are often indistinguishable. This new collection [The Mother on the Other Side of the World] displays an intimate authority and mystery of tone that are the fulfillment of a genuine gift and uncompromising devotion to it.\\" --W.S. Merwin * \\"The poems are pure, untainted by irony, naked and delighted with being. If there is one unyielding source and destination in all these poems, it is love – people and things worth loving, and the quiet mantra that's always making itself matter. Though you might find yourself laughing or wincing, you understand that above all, James Baker Hall is a serious poet. He means what he says…. Hall is the real deal, the real, beautiful deal.\\" -- Maurice Manning Selected awards * 2001 - Poet Laureate of Kentucky * 1993 - Southern Arts Council Fellowship * 1986 - Al Smith Fellowship * 1986 - Honorable Mention, San Francisco Art Institute Film Festival * 1983 - Pushcart Prize * 1980 - National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship * 1973 - Juror's Prize: Photovision (Boston) * 1967 - O.

In June 2010, a California-based investment group acquired the mall with plans to revitalize it. However, as of early 2012, there were numerous vacancies in the mall. While marketing and signage have advertised the construction of an indoor ice rink and a large sushi and seafood buffet., After over a year later there have been no indications of communication between mall ownership and the city in terms of beginning construction for these projects, On January 4, 2011, Sears announced that their Charlestowne location would close before April 3, 2011 after negotiations between the new mall management company and Sears officials broke down, leaving only Carson Pirie Scott (now known as Carson's), Kohl's, and Von Maur the remaining anchor stores. Sears shut its doors for the last time on March 20, 2011. After two years of no contact with the mall's ownership, city officials stated a plan in 2012 to spend $35,000 on a study to determine the best options for the mall site. In mid-August the abandoned mall was put under contract to be sold by Mark Goodman & Associates. They hoped to close on the property as soon as mid September, according to the Daily Herald. A full presentation of the future plans of the mall was to be given to the city within the next 30–45 days they stated. \\"Goodman said his group 'absolutely' intends to keep the mall property as some form of a shopping center.\\"  The Quad St. Charles  On November 14, 2013, The Krausz Companies Inc acquired the mall property and renamed it from Charlestowne Mall to The Quad St. Charles. The new owners planned to demolish the current Sears wing of the mall and completely remodel the interior and exterior of the mall. \\"The inspiration for The Quad name centers on the \\"neighborhood feeling\\" the company is trying to bring to the mall through a redesign. Outdoor patio dining and exterior merchandised retails will be part of the mall for the first time. There will also be a 'welcoming center' with a fireplace as the key attraction for families and shoppers to gather. The existing abundant natural light will be retained in the new environment\\" said Krausz Executive Vice President Jay E. Krigsman. Construction was expected to start in April 2014 and completed by Fall 2015. The mall's famous 2 level Italian carousel was also put up for sale due to there being no room for it in the mall's new floor plan. As of April 2014, the only true tenant left in the mall was Lenscrafters (excluding anchor stores). Lenscrafters, the anchor stores, and the movie theater planned to stay open during construction. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in August 2014, and mass earthworks were in process at the site preparing for the redevelopment of the main mall buildings. Updating the city council in April 2015, representatives of Krausz shared that the project was proceeding with a grand reopening contemplated for 2016. At the end of May 2015, the carousel was disassembled. On March 16, 2016, it was announced that Kohl's would be closing as part of a plan to close 18 stores nationwide. The store closed on June 25, 2016. In early 2017, the Classic Cinemas received a new exterior entrance. Cooper's Hawk Winery & Restaurants opened outside of the mall on May 15, 2017. The original plan for redevelopment was canceled in 2017. In mid-2017, the east wing of the mall, spanning the center court to Carson's, was closed; its mall entrances permanently locked, and a large wall was constructed on both floors near the center court. The rest of the mall interior, originally announced to close on October 31, 2017, finally closed December 1 with the exception of Carson's, Von Maur, Classic Cinemas; and accessible via the theatre: a long-standing kiosk, and a gymnasium still leasing a former Deb between the theatre and the vacant Sears anchor, on the second floor. On April 18, 2018, Bon-Ton Stores Inc. announced the closure of Carson's, leaving Von Maur, Classic Cinemas and Power Athletics as the last stores in the mall.

Some of miners said that they could hear the tommyknockers singing and working deep in the dark mine shafts and cracks within the walls. Two legends of the tommyknocker were brought to the United States by immigrants from Cornwall, England. One kind was mischievous, who dumped out the miners' lunches, blew out their candles, and hid their picks and axes on them. The other kind were friendly and were said to knock on the walls of the mines to show where the richest deposits of gold were. Achievements Tommyknocker root beer has a distinct flavor in comparison to other root beers, attributable to the unique ingredients used in its creation, including mountain cherry, mountain maple, valerian root, fenugreek, St. John's wort, melissa, birch, licorice root, hops extract, malt extract, and maple syrup. Tommyknocker has won numerous awards in their beer, and their root beer has also won various prizes from around the nation in contests, and beverage studies. The Showdown On March 18, 2001, six researchers tested, tasted, and compared seven different types of root beer that were produced all throughout the nation, such as IBC Root Beer, Barq's and Tommyknocker. Tommyknocker was judged to have an average taste, however, they graded the root beer 2.67 points in the first round. The other root beers in the showoff were rated: Faygo (3.24), Pirate's Keg (2.93), Stewart's (2.90), Dad's (2.74), Big Shooter / Dog-n-Suds / Virgil's (2.67), and Route 66 (2.17), and Natural Brew (2.10).

The historical area of Maryina Roshcha, which emerged in the mid-19th century on the site of Sheremetev family lands, retained its low-rise, country style until the 1960s. History The village of Maryino (), also known as Boyarkino (), appears in official registers since 1678, when it had a population of 102 people in 22 households. Maryino and the adjacent village of Ostankino (located on the territory of modern Ostankinsky District) with a park were owned by the Cherkassky family. In the mid-18th century, the last Princess Cherkassky married Count P.B. Sheremetev and the land passed into Sheremetev family's possession. Sheremetevskaya Street—the main north-south street of the district—is still named after these past landlords. Around this time, a grove (roshcha) near the village of Maryino was called \\"Maryina\\", a name that \\"has stuck to this day, even though the grove was completely cut down in the late 19th century\\".Vladimir Kozlov, \\"The colourful past and present of Maryina Roshcha \\". The Moscow News, September 13, 2010. After the Great Fire of 1812, the groves between Moscow and Maryino were felled for timber, but quickly recovered and became a popular picnic destination. The name Maryina Roshcha became a toponym independent of the old Maryino village. Vasily Zhukovsky wrote a romantic story of the same name; his version of the etymology is pure fiction, as is the legend linking Maryina Roshcha to a female highway robber called Marya. Between 1851 and 1882, railroad construction isolated Maryina Roshcha from Moscow (south) and Ostankino (north). In the 1880s, a French real estate developer signed a long- term lease with the Sheremetev family, cleared the trees, and leveled the area for cheap low-rise construction, creating the rectangular grid of streets and alleys that still exists today. However, they did not bother to set up water supply or a sewage system. The proximity of railroads quickly attracted industrialists like Gustav List, who built factories on the edges of Maryina Roshcha. Wooden houses were occupied by workers of these factories, including an ethnic minority of Mordvin laborers, who settled in the area in 1901. The existing orthodox church of Unexpected Joyphotographs - orthodox church of Unexpected Joywas built by public subscription in 1899-1904 and operated continuously through the Soviet years. Maryina Roshcha, located outside the Moscow city limits, was inadequately policed by the country administration. This attracted shady persons, and the area was considered a criminal ghetto, especially after World War I and Russian Civil War, when law-abiding men were drafted and perished in the army, and the Bolshevik administration expropriated all livestock from the residents. The area remained unsafe until the 1960s. The post-World War II Maryina Roshcha underworld was featured in The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed mini-series. Joseph Stalin's master plan of 1935 proposed building a north-south highway through Maryina Roshcha, which would have led to demolition of the 19th-century housing. This plan did not materialize, and while wooden Maryina Roshcha was being gradually demolished, some wooden building survived until the 1960s. The remainder was cleared in the late 1970s in preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics. The last remaining tram lines were closed in 2002, when the district's southern boundary was converted into the Third Ring highway. The Third Ring Road Municipal status As a municipal division, it is incorporated as Maryina roshcha Municipal Okrug.Law #59 Transportation Moscow Metro had expanded the Lyublinskaya Line to Maryina Roshcha metro station on June 19, 2010.Марьина Роща The district is also accessible via Savyolovskaya, Rizhskaya (south), and Alexeyevskaya (north) stations.

Life Isaac Royall and family by Robert Feke. He is depicted with (left to right) his sister Penelope Royall (Vassall), his sister-in-law Mary McIntosh Palmer, his daughter Elizabeth, and his wife Royall Jr. was the son of Squire Isaac Royall Sr. (1677–1739) a slave owner, Antiguan plantation owner, slave trader, and justice of the peace. Coming from humble circumstances in North Yarmouth in what was then Massachusetts and now Maine, the elder Royall's family moved to Dorchester, Massachusetts, to avoid Native American attacks. Royall Sr. subsequently made his fortune in the trade of enslaved people, rum, and sugar; in 1700, at age 23, Royall's father moved to Antigua and was the part owner of a Massachusetts slaving ship. Isaac Royall Sr.'s son Isaac Jr. was born in Antigua in 1719; a daughter, Penelope Royall, was born there in 1724. The Royall family then faced turmoil: a bad drought in 1725, a massive hurricane in 1733, earthquakes in 1735, and both a smallpox epidemic and a slave revolt in 1736. Due to these events, Royall Sr. decided to return to New England. Beginning in 1732, in anticipation of his move, Royall began purchasing a 500-acre estate in Charlestown, Massachusetts (now Medford) near the Mystic River, which he named Ten Hills Farm. In 1737, the family moved to the estate, bringing with them at least 27 enslaved Africans. The estate includes a three- story Georgian mansion (expanded from an earlier, more modest structure), a carriage house, a stable, an \\"out kitchen,\\" and a number of barns. After Issac Sr. died in 1739, Isaac Jr., then twenty years old, inherited his father's estate, variously described as \\"immense\\" and \\"small but prosperous.\\" Isaac Jr. inherited not only Ten Hills Farm (which is now the Isaac Royall House, a museum containing the only slave quarters in the northeast United States) but also eighteen of the people his father enslaved and his father's plantation in Antigua. Royall thereafter became one of the colony's wealthiest men, and an active investor in real estate; he purchased silver from Paul Revere, traveled in a stagecoach with liveried servants, purchased fine china and furniture from abroad, and hosted lavish parties. In 1754, he owned 12 enslaved Africans. Royall held a number of civic offices, serving as justice of the peace, chairman of the Medford board of selectmen, and representative of Medford to the colonial legislature; he returned his salary to the town treasury. Royall was elected to the Governor's Council in 1752 (serving until 1774), held the honorary military rank of Brigadier General of the Province, and served as an overseer of Harvard College (along with Thomas Pownall). Royall also held pews at King's Chapel and Christ Church. In 1738, Royall married Elizabeth McIntosh, then fifteen years old, the daughter of a friend of Royall's father. The marriage was advantageous and confirmed Royall's place in the colonial elite. During the American Revolution, Royall apparently had Patriot sympathies but significant Loyalist connections. He fled Medford three days before the Battle of Lexington, abandoning the people he enslaved to their freedom. Along with many others, Royall was named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act of 1778. He was unable to travel to Antigua so instead fled to Nova Scotia, where he remained for a year before moving to England, where he joined his daughters' families and died of smallpox in 1781. There is a portrait of Royall by John Singleton Copley and another of his wife, Elizabeth. Robert Feke also painted a family group portrait which depicts him, his wife and his daughter. This daughter Elizabeth married into the Pepperell family and their daughter married Sir Charles Palmer of Wanlip in Leicestershire. Royall's sister was Penelope Royall (1724–1800), who married Colonel Henry Vassall (the son of a Jamaican planter) in 1742; they moved to Cambridge. Harvard Law School In his will of 1779, Royall left land to Harvard College to establish the first professorship in law at the school. This bequest led to the founding of Harvard Law School in 1817. In 1936, to celebrate the university's tercentenary, Harvard alumnus and former English professor Pierre de Chaignon la Rose drew seals for each of Harvard's graduate schools. For Harvard Law School, la Rose adopted Royall's coat of arms, a blue shield adorned with three sheaves of wheat. This seal was adopted by the Harvard Corporation. In 2016, the seal became the object of controversy due to Royall's slaveholding in Antigua, where in 1736 the colonial government had 77 slaves convicted of conspiracy to revolt burnt at the stake. Students under the name 'Royall Must Fall' (fashioned after the Rhodes Must Fall Movement) organized to have the seal removed. After several incidents of unknown racial attacks within the Law School community, specifically the Black Tape Incident, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow was pressured by students to create a committee of students, faculty, staff, and alumni to recommend whether to change the seal. In 2016, Harvard Law School officially decided to scrap the seal that contained Royall's arms.

Operation On January 27, 1973, Henry Kissinger (then assistant to the President for national security affairs) agreed to a ceasefire with representatives of North Vietnam that provided for the withdrawal of American military forces from South Vietnam. The agreement also postulated for the release of nearly 600 American prisoners of war (POWs) held by North Vietnam and its allies within 60 days of the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The deal would come to be known as Operation Homecoming and was divided into three phases. The first phase required the initial reception of prisoners at three release sites: POWs held by the Viet Cong (VC) were to be flown by helicopter to Saigon, POWs held by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) were released in Hanoi and the three POWs held in China were to be freed in Hong Kong. The former prisoners were to then be flown to Clark Air Base in the Philippines where they were to be processed at a reception center, debriefed, and receive a physical examination. The final phase was the relocation of the POWs to military hospitals. On February 12, 1973, three C-141 transports flew to Hanoi, North Vietnam, and one C-9A aircraft was sent to Saigon, South Vietnam to pick up released prisoners of war. The first flight of 40 U.S. prisoners of war left Hanoi in a C-141A, later known as the \\"Hanoi Taxi\\" and is now in a museum. Locations of POW camps in North Vietnam From February 12 to April 4, there were 54 C-141 missions flying out of Hanoi, bringing the former POWs home. During the early part of Operation Homecoming, groups of POWs released were selected on the basis of longest length of time in prison. The first group had spent six to eight years as prisoners of war. The last POWs were turned over to allied hands on March 29, 1973 raising the total number of Americans returned to 591. Of the POWs repatriated to the United States a total of 325 of them served in the United States Air Force, a majority of which were bomber pilots shot down over North Vietnam or VC controlled territory. The remaining 266 consisted of 138 United States Naval personnel, 77 soldiers serving in the United States Army, 26 United States Marines and 25 civilian employees of American government agencies. A majority of the prisoners were held at camps in North Vietnam, however some POWs were held in at various locations throughout Southeast Asia. A total of 69 POWs were held in South Vietnam by the VC and would eventually leave the country aboard flights from Loc Ninh, while only nine POWs were released from Laos, as well as an additional three from China. The prisoners returned included future politicians Senator John McCain of Arizona and Representative Sam Johnson of Texas. John L. Borling, a former POW returned during Operation Homecoming, stated that after being flown to Clark Air Base, hospitalized and debriefed, many of the doctors and psychologists were amazed by the resiliency of a majority of the men. Some of the repatriated soldiers, including Borling and John McCain, did not retire from the military, but instead decided to further their careers in the armed forces. The Kissinger Twenty The Hoa Lo Prison, commonly referred to as the \\"Hanoi Hilton\\" by American POWs, in 1973 The culture of the POWs held at the infamous Hanoi Hilton prison was on full display with the story that would come to be known as the \\"Kissinger Twenty\\". One of the tenets of the agreed upon code between those held at the Hanoi Hilton stipulated that the POWs, unless seriously injured, would not accept an early release. The rule entailed that the prisoners would return home in the order that they were shot down and captured. The POWs held at the Hanoi Hilton were to deny early release because the communist government of North Vietnam could possibly use this tactic as propaganda or as a reward for military intelligence. Phil Butler is welcomed home by his family after 7 years and 10 months as a POW in North Vietnam The first round of POWs to be released in February 1973 mostly included injured soldiers in need of medical attention. Following the first release, twenty prisoners were then moved to a different section of the prison, but the men knew something was wrong as several POWs with longer tenures were left in their original cells. After discussions the twenty men agreed that they should not have been the next POWs released as they estimated it should have taken another week and a half for most of their discharges and came to the conclusion that their early release would likely be used for North Vietnamese propaganda. Consequently, in adherence with their code, the men did not accept release by refusing to follow instructions or put on their clothes. Finally, on the fifth day of protest Colonel Norm Gaddis, the senior American officer left at the Hanoi Hilton, went to the men's cell and gave them a direct order that they would cooperate. The men followed orders, but with the stipulation that no photographs were to be taken of them. It turned out that when Henry Kissinger went to Hanoi after the first round of releases, the North Vietnamese gave him a list of the next 112 men scheduled to be sent home. They asked Kissinger to select twenty more men to be released early as a sign of good will. Unaware of the code agreed upon by the POWs, Kissinger ignored their shot down dates and circled twenty names at random. Aftermath Hanoi Taxi, used in Operation Homecoming, flying over the National Museum of the United States Air Force in December 2005 Overall, Operation Homecoming did little to satisfy the American public's need for closure on the war in Vietnam. After Operation Homecoming, the U.S. still listed about 1,350 Americans as prisoners of war or missing in action and sought the return of roughly 1,200 Americans reported killed in action and body not recovered. These missing personnel would become the subject of the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue for years to come. As of 26 July 2019 the Department of Defense's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency listed 1,587 Americans as missing in the war of which 1,009 were classified as further pursuit, 90 deferred and 488 non-recoverable. In addition, the return of the nearly 600 POWs further polarized the sides of the American public and media. A large number of Americans viewed the recently freed POWs as heroes of the nation returning home, reminiscent of the celebrations following World War II. No matter the opinion of the public, the media became infatuated with the men returned in Operation Homecoming who were bombarded with questions concerning life in the VC and PAVN prison camps. Topics included a wide range of inquiries about sadistic guards, secret communication codes among the prisoners, testimonials of faith, and debates over celebrities and controversial figures. The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and the U.S. Department of State each had liaison officers dedicated to prepare for the return of American POWs well in advance of their actual return. These liaison officers worked behind the scenes traveling around the United States assuring the returnees' well being. They also were responsible for debriefing POWs to discern relevant intelligence about MIAs and to discern the existence of war crimes committed against them. Each POW was also assigned their own escort to act as a buffer between \\"past trauma and future shock\\". However, access to the former prisoners was screened carefully and most interviews and statements given by the men were remarkably similar, leading many journalists to believe that the American government and military had coached them beforehand. Izvestia, a Soviet newspaper, accused The Pentagon of brainwashing the men involved in order to use them as propaganda, while some Americans claimed the POWs were collaborating with the communists or had not done enough to resist pressure to divulge information under torture. The former prisoners were slowly reintroduced, issued their back pay and attempted to catch up on social and cultural events that were now history. Many of the returned POWs struggled to become reintegrated with their families and the new American culture as they had been held in captivity for between a year to almost ten years. The men had missed events including the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, the race riots of 1968, the political demonstrations and anti-war protests, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon and the release of The Godfather. Former American POWs departing from Hanoi on March 28, 1973 The returning of POWs was often a mere footnote following most other wars in U.S. history, yet those returned in Operation Homecoming provided the country with an event of drama and celebration. Operation Homecoming initially ignited a torrent of patriotism that had not been seen at any point during the Vietnam War. Overall, the POWs were warmly received as if to atone for the collective American guilt for having ignored and protested the majority of soldiers who had served in the conflict and already returned home. The joy brought by the repatriation of the 591 Americans did not last for long due to other major news stories and events. By May 1973, the Watergate scandal dominated the front page of most newspapers causing the American public's interest to wane in any story related to the war in Vietnam. Correspondingly, Richard Nixon and his administration began to focus on salvaging his presidency. Many worried that Homecoming hid the fact that people were still fighting and dying on the battlefields of Vietnam and caused the public to forget about the over 50,000 American lives the war had already cost. Veterans of the war had similar thoughts concerning Operation Homecoming with many stating that the ceasefire and returning of prisoners brought no ending or closure. Remembrance The 1st Marine Division honoring the 40th anniversary of Operation Homecoming The plane used in the transportation of the first group of prisoners of war, a C-141 commonly known as the Hanoi Taxi (Air Force Serial Number 66-0177), has been altered several times since February 12, 1973, to include its conversion (fuselage extension) from a C-141A to a C-141B. Nevertheless, the aircraft has been maintained as a flying tribute to the POWs and MIAs of the Vietnam War and is now housed at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. The Hanoi Taxi was officially retired at Wright Patterson Air Force Base on May 6, 2006, just a year after it was used to evacuate the areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Operation Homecoming has been largely forgotten by the American public, yet ceremonies commemorating the 40th anniversary were held at United States military bases and other locations throughout Asia and the United States.

A standout high school athlete in his hometown of Fredericktown, Ohio, Cline attended Ohio State University starting in 1944. He became the football team's primary fullback that year as the school went unbeaten and was ranked second in the nation in the AP Poll. The following year, Cline was named the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference, rushing for 936 yards as Ohio State built up a 7–2 record and was ranked 12th in the AP Poll. Following a brief stint in the U.S. Army at the end of World War II, Cline returned to Ohio State for a final season in 1947. Cline began his professional career by signing with the Browns, a team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) coached by former Ohio State head coach Paul Brown. Cleveland won all of its games and the AAFC championship in 1948 while Cline served as a backup to fullback Marion Motley. Cleveland traded Cline to the Buffalo Bills, where he spent the 1949 season, and joined the Lions in 1950 when the AAFC folded. The Lions won the NFL Championship Game in 1952 and 1953, beating the Browns both times. Cline then retired from football and earned a master's degree in education. He later worked at a variety of school systems in Ohio and Arizona. Cline was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame and was named to the Ohio State Football All-Century Team in 2000. He died in 2001. Early life and college career Cline grew up in Fredericktown, Ohio and attended the local Fredericktown High School, where he played on the football team as a back. In a 1942 game against Mount Gilead High School, he scored seven touchdowns and kicked two extra points, scoring 44 total points in a 79–6 victory. After graduating from high school, Cline attended Ohio State University and played on the school's football team starting as a freshman in 1944. Although he was overshadowed by teammate Les Horvath, who won the Heisman Trophy that year, Cline was the team's starting fullback and ran for 221 yards on 65 carries, scoring 39 points. The Buckeyes won the Big Ten Conference championship with an undefeated 9-0 record and were ranked second in the country in the AP Poll. The 1945 season was the most productive of Cline's college career. He led the Big Ten in rushing with 936 yards, at the time a school record, and scored nine touchdowns. Cline rushed for 229 yards in a November game against the University of Pittsburgh, setting an Ohio State single-game record that stood for 27 years until Archie Griffin broke it in 1972. The Buckeyes finished with a 7–2 record for third in the Big Ten and were ranked 12th in the AP Poll. Cline was awarded the Chicago Tribune Silver Football, given to the most valuable player in the Big Ten. He was named a second-team All-American by the Associated Press and a third-team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America. Cline was accepted for military service before the 1945 season, but was not called up for duty until the following February. Cline, who had been passed over by the U.S. Army twice because of a punctured ear drum, was sent to Camp Atterbury, a training base in Indiana. When the war ended, Cline returned to Ohio State in 1947 and rushed for 332 yards and two touchdowns in eight games. The team finished the season with a 2–6–1 record. Professional career Cline decided to begin his professional career in 1948 despite that he had a year of college eligibility remaining. The move upset some Ohio State supporters worried about the team's loss of talent, but Cline said he wanted to go pro because he was getting married and needed to start making money. He had been drafted by the National Football League's Chicago Bears, but signed instead with the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by former Ohio State coach Paul Brown. \\"I plan to be married in June,\\" Cline said at the time. \\"I feel I have a great opportunity with the Browns, and I've always wanted to play for Paul Brown. I feel that I have made the only logical decision.\\" Although Brown's tenure as Ohio State coach predated Cline's career there, Brown said he had followed Cline with interest. \\"Ollie isn't big, as pro fullbacks go, but he can run – and I like 'em when they can run,\\" Brown said. In the Browns, Cline joined a team that had won the AAFC championships 1946 and 1947 behind an offensive attack that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Serving as a backup to Motley, Cline ran for 129 yards in 1948, when Cleveland went undefeated and won the AAFC championship for the third time in a row. Despite Cline's ties to Brown and Ohio State, Cleveland traded him to the Buffalo Bills after the season. He responded by turning in the best year of his professional career, running for 518 yards and three touchdowns. The Bills faced the Browns three times that year, tying twice and losing once in a playoff game. Buffalo finished with a 5–5–2 record and did not reach the league championship game. The AAFC folded after the 1949 season, but three teams were merged into the NFL: the Browns, Baltimore Colts and San Francisco 49ers. With the folding of the Bills, Cline was placed in the 1950 AAFC Dispersal Draft and taken in the second round (No. 19 overall) by the New York Giants, but was traded by New York to the Detroit Lions for end Kelly Mote. Cline played for the Lions for four seasons. Led by quarterback Bobby Layne and halfback Doak Walker, the Lions won the NFL championship in 1952 and 1953, beating the Browns both times. Later career and death After his playing career, Cline received a master's degree in education from Ohio's Wittenberg University in 1965. His educational career took him to posts at school systems in Springfield, Ohio, Sidney, Ohio, Mount Vernon, Ohio and Prescott, Arizona. By the early 1970s, he was principal of North Union High School in Richwood, Ohio. He also served as the dean of men at Urbana College in Urbana, Ohio. Cline was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame and named to the Ohio State Football All-Century Team in 2000. He died in 2001. His hometown of Fredericktown declared January 20, 2001 \\"Ollie Cline Day\\" in his honor.

Life and work Born in London, Ernest George began his architectural training in 1856, under Samuel Hewitt, coupled with studies at the Royal Academy Schools 1857-59\\\\. After a short period in the office of Allen Boulnois, he went on a sketching tour of France and Germany, which inspired him to the architectural style that would make him famous.Times Higher Education, 7 July 2011: The Architecture of Sir Ernest George Linked 2017-02-06 On his return to London, he set up an architectural practice in 1861 with Thomas Vaughan.The Lutyens Trust: The Architecture of Sir Ernest George Linked 2017-02-06 They had their breakthrough in 1869, when Ernest George was contacted by the tea and spice importer and Member of Parliament Henry Peek (son of James Peek who started the biscuit business Peak Frean & Co). He was about to buy the village of Rousdon in Devon, and wanted George to build him a large mansion house south of the village, plus several other buildings. This complex became eventually known as the Rousdon Estate, and from 1930 to 1998 the George-designed mansion house served as the private boarding school Allhallows College. Vaughn suddenly died in 1869, forcing George to find another partner. He chose the young Harold Peto, mainly because of the Peto family's vast contact network in the building industry. During this partnership, George designed houses in London for the Cadogan Estate in Chelsea and Kensington. In 1881 they designed Stoodleigh Court at Tiverton for Thomas Carew. In 1891 they designed an extension to West Dean House for William James, creating the Oak Room, now Oak Hall in West Dean College. In 1891, Harold Peto decided to leave London for health reasons, and to devote more time to his interests in garden design, at which point George made a former pupil, Alfred Bowman Yeates, his new partner. In New Zealand, which he never visited, he designed the Theomin family house Olveston in Dunedin which was built 1904–07.M. Blackman, Dorothy Theomin of Olveston (2007. The Friends of Olveston, Dunedin, NZ) , pp.17-19. He was also responsible for the current Southwark Bridge (1921), and the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice in London's Postman's Park. He served as president of the Royal Institute of British Architects from 1908 to 1910. Ernest George's London office was nicknamed \\"The Eton of architects\\",A.

During the course of the book, various other themes are also satirised, including health and safety regulations, manufactured pop (including a parody of Girls Aloud, called Gurlz Banned) and lawyers. The book follows the lives of three somewhat unusual individuals over a period spanning a few days, in which their stories eventually interact to varying extents. Character histories Grenville Roberts: A divorced TV chef who is so fat that he is no longer \\"off the peg\\". Tends to slip into a rage should anybody mention his weight. He destroys another person's car and much of a health club during one such episode. Throughout the story he makes many bitter remarks at the law system and how society mistreats overweight people. After being fired from his job as a TV Chef (His famous book had ten pages dedicated to boiling eggs), his agent told him about the idea of the Government Well Farms to get him back on his feet. After the VIP opening, which he spots one of the other characters, Jeremy Slank, he arrives along with other obese small-time celebrities and is appalled at the state. Eventually the conditions and incompetence drive him to an insane rage and he demolishes the camp by breaking chairs, windows, and using a mower to carve out a swear word to the Prime Minister. In the end, he is given his own TV show where he goes to restaurants, and uses his rage to take them down a peg or two. Hayleigh Griffin: A teenage girl who is starving herself by avoiding food where possible and discarding/regurgitating if not; indicating she probably has anorexia. She worships a pop idol called Jase which could be the cause as she constantly wants to impress him. During the story she goes to extreme lengths including faking her period and pretending to eat breakfast. The situation becomes so bad she has to go to hospital and have psychiatry treatments. At the same time, Jeremy Slank, the third character in the story, is investigating the NHS hospitals and sees her. He arranges a meeting with the pop idol and he comes to her drugged up and smelling. Eventually the entire ordeal seems to cure her anorexia and she becomes quite happy, taking on Jeremy as her new icon. Initially, the reader will believe her to be fat, but it later transpires that she is unhealthily thin. Jeremy Slank: A \\"Conceptuologist\\" (politically correct term for PR man, parodying complicated job titles that have arisen in recent years) who is involved in the Well Farms project in the story to help fight weight problems. He is the only character to meet/interact with the other two. He is described as average and normal as he is trying to impress the Prime Minister. After a monologue of how he thinks it will go, he instead is given two minutes by a bulky security guard and is put on a helicopter to the Well Farms. On the helicopter he meets a student called Jemma who he then starts to flirt with and she tells him what she thinks of the project. After the tour and Jeremy doing his job, she invites him for dinner and almost starts to perform oral sex before realising it's not her boyfriend and leaves. As he checks his e-mail frustrated, he finds an e-mail from the Prime Minister saying on how he did a great job. He is next seen at the Press conference opening the Well Farms to which the Prime Minister actually remembers and greets him. He is then put on his right hand side as the Prime Minister introduces the project. Because the Well Farms are such a 'success', 'P' (As he lets Jeremy call him that now) asks Jeremy to handle the rebranding of the NHS. Jeremy then takes a tour, but goes on his own, and discovers Hayleigh revealing she is very anorexic.

As they are performing, we see that they are being observed by the occupants of an alien spaceship (John Davidson and Suzanne Somers) who are on their way to Earth to meet The Carpenters. After Richard and Karen finish the song, the lights in the studio begin to flicker uncontrollably and musical instruments begin to move and play by themselves. At that moment, John teleports down to the studio and tells Richard and Karen how the people from his planet lack the ability to make music and he requests their help. Richard and Karen tell John about their earlier days in music and John uses his hi- tech pocket video screen to show The Carpenters performing \\"Fun Fun Fun\\" and \\"Dancing in the Street\\". After watching them, John tells them he wants to try singing himself and teleports to a more romantic setting to perform \\"Just the Way You Are\\". The Carpenters continue to reminisce about their earlier recordings and they perform \\"Goofus\\" in an old garage, similar to the one in which they recorded their first record. Richard, on piano, then performs the Space Encounters Medley, which includes the themes to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars, on stage with a full orchestra, complete with laser and starlight effects. Back in the recording studio, Karen and John continue to reminisce about her early days in music and she performs \\"Little Girl Blue\\".

He was the only son of David Creighton of Crom Castle and Catherine Southwell, daughter of Richard Southwell. He married Elizabeth Rogerson, eldest daughter of John Rogerson, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and Elizabeth Ludlow, and they had four surviving children, two sons and two daughters. Crom Castle Erne was a major landowner in County Fermanagh. He represented Lifford in the Irish House of Commons from 1727 until 1768, when he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Erne, of Crom Castle in the County of Fermanagh. He died in June 1772 and was succeeded in the barony by his son John, who was later created Earl Erne. Up to 1729, Alexander Montgomery shared the parliamentary patronage of Lifford, County Donegal, with the Creighton family, the Earls of Erne. There is an agreement in the Erne papers (held in the Northern Ireland Public Records Office) dated 1727 between Alexander Montgomery and General David Creighton about the sharing of Lifford Corporation and its representation in the Irish House of Commons, to which it sent two MPs. One of the articles of agreement was that, if Montgomery should die without a son, then his interest should pass to the Creightons. Montgomery was elected as an MP for County Donegal in the general election held later on in 1727 so General David Creighton and his son and heir, Abraham Creighton (later the 1st Lord Erne), were returned as the two Lifford MPs. General David Creighton died in 1728 so the Lifford seat was filled by Thomas Montgomery, the nephew of Alexander. On the death of Thomas Montgomery in 1760, full control of the Lifford seats passed to Abraham Creighton. Notes References *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

The show often deals with what's going on around Western New York including anything relating to the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres. History The show got its start in 1994 when Tom Ragan, then on WGR as The Tom and Karen Show was paired with Ted Shredd, then on WUFX as Ted Shredd and Mr. Ed Show. The show first made a name for itself by covering (and making fun of) the Buffalo State College Prostitute trial, and airing non-stop bits on the O.J. Simpson trial, culminating in the \\"OJ Bronco Chase Parade\\" on Buffalo's Kensington Expressway. In 1995, WUFX changed formats and renamed as WEDG, keeping only Shredd and Ragan from the previous roster. In an often told on-air story, Shredd and Ragan explain how they went across the street to a staff meeting, looked around cluelessly, and then realized they were the only ones from the current airstaff sitting in the room. Shredd and Ragan were also the first to speak with football player Terrell Owens upon his arrival to the Buffalo Bills. =Move Back to Mornings= On January 4, 2012, it was announced that Shredd and Ragan would be moving back to mornings starting January 9, 2012.http://www.buffalonews.com/entertainment/article694574.ece When the Opie and Anthony show came to WEDG in 2006, Shredd and Ragan were moved to afternoons 3-7pm, moving Bull Radio to 12-3p, and moving then jock Val Townsend (now at sister station WHTT) to 9-12pm.

The town of Nukwo is approximately , by road, northeast of Mbale, the nearest large city. The coordinates of the district are 01 16N, 34 44E. Overview The district was created on 1 July 2005. Before then, Bukwo District was part of Kapchorwa District. It was created out of Kongasis county. The district has many well-educated people, but many have left to find greater prosperity in the neighbouring country of Kenya. Many of the district's roads are inaccessible or impassable. There is a widespread lack of electricity and telecommunication services throughout the district. The various Ugandan governments have not developed this part of the country, starting with the colonial governments in the early part of the 20th century, through the Obote I, Idi Amin, Obote II, and National Resistance Movement regimes. Many of the inhabitants of Bukwo District live in abject poverty. The district is also plagued by persistent insecurity due to cattle raids and cattle rustling by ethnic groups from Karamoja located in northeastern Uganda and the Turkana and Pokot peoples from neighbouring Kenya. These challenges date to the 1950s and 1960s. Most of the people from the northern part of the district have been internally displaced by cattle rustlers and have since not been resettled back in their original land. Some of these people opted to purchase land from areas that appeared secure while others who could not afford to purchase new land continue to exist as squatters on well-wishers' land. Population In 1991, the national population census estimated the district population at 30,700. The national census in 2002 estimated the population at 49,000, with an annual population growth rate of 4.2 percent. In 2012, the population was estimated at 73,400.

The surviving exchequer hall is reputed to be the oldest non-ecclesiastical building in Cornwall. The much larger great hall, of which large parts remain, was built as a replica of Westminster Hall. Its original function was as a court and place of taxation dealing with the Cornish tin industry. The Earls of Cornwall and later, after 1337, the Dukes of Cornwall had their residence at Restormel Castle so the original name would have been the Stannary Hall or the Great Hall of Lostwithiel. After 1337 it was sometimes referred to as the Duchy Palace. In 1265 Richard, Earl of Cornwall, second son of King John and brother of King Henry III, acquired Restormel Castle, the Borough of Lostwithiel and the town of Fowey, from the de Cardinan family. During this period Lostwithiel was the most important port of Cornwall and second only to Southampton along the South Coast. In 1273 Richard died and was succeeded by his son Edmund, who took occupation of Restormel Castle and built the Great Hall. This building was a very large complex, covering more than and consisted of the Great Hall, which was the Convocation Hall for the Stannaries and Duchy affairs. It also housed the smelting houses, the coinage hall for the stannaries and duchy. In this complex the stannary courts were held and the stannary prison located. Records state that the whole complex was built and completed between 1272 and 1300 and regarded as the finest and grandest buildings in Cornwall. In 1338 the earldom was raised to a dukedom and the first duke was the Edward, the Black Prince. The building then became the administrative centre for the duchy and the only polling station for the whole of Cornwall. The Cornish Stannaries were suspended as a consequence of the Cornish Rebellion of 1497.Timeline of Cornish History 1966 -1700 AD, (Cornwall County Council) Henry VII restored them in return for a payment from the tin miners of the, at the time, enormous sum of £1,000, to support his war on Scotland. In addition to restoring the stannaries and pardoning the people who participated in the rebellion, Henry's Charter of Pardon of 1508 provided that no new laws affecting miners should be enacted without the consent of twenty-four stannators, six being chosen from each of the four stannaries at Lostwithiel, Launceston, Truro and Helston. The 1508 Charter states, \\"No [Westminster] Act or Statute shall have effect in the Stannaries without the assent and consent of the twenty-four stannators.\\" Acting in its capacity as appeal court for the colonies, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has declared that any reference to the stannaries means the whole of Cornwall. Although England had its own London-based exchequer, the unabridged Charter of Pardon makes no less than ten separate references to the Lostwithiel exchequer; thus illustrating one aspect of the constitutional linkage between Stannary and Duchy. In September 1644 AD, the English Civil War was at its height and the town of Lostwithiel was taken by the Earl of Essex who made it his headquarters. During the battle the town was badly damaged, the Great Hall sacked and burnt, destroying valuable records of the Shire and stannaries. The part known as the Exchequer Hall was the least damaged and this then became the Convocation Hall for the Stannaries and the Public Convocation. In 1533, John Leland stated that “in Lostwithiel is the Shire Hall for Cornwall and it is the Shire town for Cornwall.” In 1585 John Norden, in his survey, stated the same. In 1495 Henry VII instructed Parliament to pass an Act that the Weights and Measures for Cornwall be placed at Lostwithiel and these weights are now part of the Old Borough Regalia. The last tinners' parliament was held in the Hall in 1751 and in 1874 the Duchy offices were removed elsewhere. The whole building was sold to tradesmen of the town. The Convocation Hall became a drill hall. This is now owned by the Freemasons. Within the building in the upper anteroom, traces remain of a medieval rose window which was over the original south entrance. Original oak supports and timbers still exist. At the north end of the building is the Duchy Coat of Arms of the fifteen bezants, circa 1650, and it is said to be the earliest Arms of the Duchy in this formation anywhere. On the apex of the hall roof is the Prince of Wales’ plume of feathers which was probably erected by the Black Prince when he paid his first visit to Lostwithiel and Restormel Castle in 1353. Today the buildings are used as dwellings, antique shop and printers. The Duchy Palace (the building at the north end of the complex) was used as a Masonic Hall until it was purchased by the Prince's Regeneration Trust in late 2008. The trust has begun repairs, in consultation with the Cornwall Building Preservation Trust. The current tenants are Lostwithiel Town Band while other potential uses for the building are investigated.

Levtzion and J. F. P. Hopkins, Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History (Cambridge, 1981) was a leader of the Godala tribe. Yahya Ibn Ibrahim's primary significance was in his involvement with Abdallah ibn Yasin, a Berber Muslim theologian who founded the Almoravid movement.  Background  The Banu Gudala were a tribe of the Sanhaja. They lived closest to the coast, beyond the Lamtuna. These tribes rose to proclaim the truth, to repel injustice and to abolish all non- canonical taxes (magharim). They were Sunnis, strict adherents the school of Malik bin Anas. Abdallah ibn Yasin began to call people to Holy war and made them proclaim the truth. As described by Al-Bakri Yahya Ibn Ibrahim went on the Pilgrimage to Mecca and during his return journey met a jurist (Abu Imran al-Fasi). Al-Fasi was interested in the religious doctrines and customs of Ibrahim's native country. Al-Fasi found Ibrahim \\"wholly ignorant, though avid to learn, full of good intentions and firm of faith\\" From Al- Bakri: Abu Imran could not find anyone among those he deemed fit. So he sent Ibrahim to find Waggag Ibn Zalwi of the Maluksus Ibrahim followed Abu Imran's advice and visited Zalwi. Zalwi recommended a man called Abdallah ibn Yasin.  Fallout  Abdallah ibn Yasin remained among the Godala, but considered their conduct sinful. They turned hostile to him later on because they found him too strict in his religious teachings. They refused to abide by his legal opinions and counsel. Ibn Yasin visited Waggag who took the following action:  References  Category:Almoravid dynasty Category:11th-century Berber people ","title":"Yahya Ibn Ibrahim"},{"id":"9794340","text":"First edition (publ.

The phrase was coined by Peter Swenson,http://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/peter-swenson an economics professor at Yale university. Labor finds this desirable because it can point to the increased wages it offers as signs of its achievement, and labor receives more money. Capitalists may find this desirable because there are \\"worse alternatives,\\" i.e., strikes, workplace disruptions, etc. Furthermore, it acts as a barrier to entry against upstart firms. If all firms are required to pay higher than normal wages, it is difficult to compete on price, and an employer can take out an undercutting competitor by encouraging strikes. In areas where the cartelists wage is higher than other local employers using the same labor pool, they have the advantage of being able to cherry pick the best workers and can often expect extra effort from their employees. This arrangement would appear to be to the detriment of consumers, but it doesn't actually eliminate price competition. It simply removes wages as a factor, which makes employers seek new and more entrepreneurial methods of cost saving. Examples The National Civic Federation, an American economic organization founded in 1900 in an attempt to ameliorate labor disputes, is an example of negotiated cartelism in action. Their 'Industrial Arbritation Department' helped to promote collective bargaining on a multi-employer basis - thus bringing wages above the market clearing level in areas such as brewing, entertainment, boiler making, trucking and clothing.
