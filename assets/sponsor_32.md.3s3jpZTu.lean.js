The SB-33 can be emplaced by hand or scattered using the helicopter mounted SY-AT system. The body of the mine is made of two glass reinforced polycarbonate halves, with the top surface having a central neoprene pressure pad. The body has an irregular shape to make the mine harder to distinguish on the ground. To arm an SB-33, a small pin is removed from the side of the mine. After the mine has been armed, gradual pressure on the pressure plate (i.e. when the victim steps on it) rotates a locking collar until the striker is released, which flips into a stab-detonator and the mine explodes. However, sudden pressure (e.g. from a mine-clearing charge) causes the striker to lock the rotating collar in position for the duration of the pressure, preventing the mine from detonating. The combination of low metal content and resistance to overpressure make the mine extremely difficult to remove. Another version of the SB-33 called the SB-33AR (AR standing for Anti- Rimozione, \\"Counter-Removal\\") exists. It looks identical to the standard SB-33 mine. However, the SB-33AR has an integral anti-handling device specifically designed to injure deminers. The anti-handling device in an SB-33AR consists of a mercury tilt switch and battery connected to the detonator. When an SB-33AR is moved a few degrees from the horizontal (i.e. when a deminer lifts it), it detonates, blowing the victim's hand off. Generally, a small number of SB-33AR landmines would be sown inside a minefield containing standard SB-33 mines in order to hinder and deter any attempt to conduct demining operations. Copies of the mine were produced in several countries and the mine was in service with the Netherlands, Spain, Greece and Argentina. This mine is no longer produced and Italy has destroyed all operational stocks and any associated machinery required for its manufacture. However, uncleared minefields containing SB-33 mines do exist e.g. in Afghanistan, Djibouti, the Falkland Islands, Iran, Iraq, Kurdistan, and the Western Sahara.

The project intends to address the three following protocols : *a terminal management protocol; *a retailer application protocol; *an acquirer protocol. The main objectives common to the three protocols are: *protocol interoperability : each protocol is designed in such a way as to be independent of the external device and the POI; *independence of the system architecture and the integration level of the POI within the retailer application protocol; *independence of the communication support and low level protocols : each protocol is independent of the network connection and will address both wire and wireless connections.  Context  A current barrier to the development of the POI market is due to the existing fragmented market for this type of equipment, especially in Europe, where each country has adopted its own requirements and rules in terms of security and functions to be implemented in POI devices. Today's situation is the following one : *card accepting devices from one country cannot be replaced by similar devices of another country due to different ‚Äì incompatible - protocols for download, key management, communication with cash registers requiring specific software modules for each country of operation; *card accepting devices from one country cannot process transactions issued by acquirers from another country due to the incompatibility of the protocols between the two countries; *different proprietary implementation of existing ISO protocols in Europe hampers the development of central acquiring activities in Europe. The goal of the EPAS project is therefore the issuance of technical specifications and the development of open software for three major protocols to be used in a Point of Interaction environment. The protocols enable a POI to communicate with external devices and hosts. An additional aim of the project is to validate - through demonstrators - the technical feasibility of the three protocols developed in the framework of the project. The project is to be considered as a cornerstone of another initiative (\\"ERIDANE\\") initiated at the European level with several partners belonging to the EPAS Consortium. The aim of the ERIDANE project is to achieve a common set of standards for hardware and software components to be used in point-of-sales retail environments. As such, EPAS complements adequately the work carried out by the ERIDANE project which essentially focuses on the inner structure of a POI terminal used at retailers' point of sales locations. With the development of specifications, the project intends to issue a new generation of open standards to be internationally deployed by equipment manufacturers, with a strong support from the banking and card payment industries as well as retailers, solutions providers and users. The consortium is made of large industrial organisations, small and medium enterprises, card payment organisations, solution providers, retailers and users, as well as an academic institution, all having an in- depth expertise in the activities to be carried out in the framework of the project. The partnership is composed of organisations belonging to Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Nordic countries.  Objectives of EPAS  The outcome of the EPAS initiative will enable to achieve interoperability by : *giving to manufacturers a technological advance vis-√†-vis their non-European competitors ; *ensuring the interoperability of protocols at a European level ; *improving the security level of the protocols. One of the objective of the European Commission in contributing to the building of the European Union is the creation of a Single European Market ensuring a free circulation of goods and persons as it is the case today for most national ‚Äì domestic ‚Äì markets in Europe. In order to anticipate undue legislation, partners in the consortium have come together to develop and disseminate a set of data protocols which would complement the business standards needed to achieve the necessary Single European Payments Area Standards. The development of standards to create a large internal market of financial services has, however, been largely endorsed, not only by the banking industry, but also by solution providers, manufacturers, retailers and users. The EPAS project foresees the development and provision of the missing links mentioned above in the creation of a unified market of electronic payments services by 2010. The EPAS project intends to bring a major benefit to the POS market by eliminating existing barriers and by allowing applications to be developed and used for both national and international markets reducing to a large extent the investments to be carried out by all actors involved. The EPAS project aims at addressing such technical bottlenecks by delivering state-of-the-art data protocols in order to ensure a smooth process of POS transactions in a forthcoming Europe- wide domestic market.  Project Development  The proposed initiative will be structured along the three following main phases : *Phase I : development of technical specifications and issuance of standards (2006 - mid-2007) *Phase II : development of software and provision of test tools (2007 ‚Äì 2008) *Phase III : construction of demonstrators (2008) The EPAS project will be conducted in line with the strategic objectives of the EPC (European Payments Council).

Biography Robert de Vis√©e's place and date of birth are unknown. He probably knew Francesco Corbetta and would have been familiar with his music. claimed that he studied with Corbetta and this information has been repeated uncritically in later sources including Strizich and Ledbetter 2001. It is however unsupported by any documentary evidence . He is first mentioned (by Le Gallois) in 1680, and at about that time became a chamber musician to Louis XIV, in which capacity he often performed at court. In 1709 he was appointed as a singer in the royal chamber, and in 1719 he was named 'Guitar Master of the King' (Ma√Ætre de Guitare du Roi) to Louis XV, the ten-year-old great-grandson of Louis XIV who succeeded to the throne in 1715. Jean Rousseau reported in a letter of 1688 that Vis√©e was a respected musician at Versailles, and also played the viol . The last payment in his name in state documents is dated 1732. It is to be assumed that he died about that time. Vis√©e published two books of guitar music which contain twelve suites between them, as well as a few separate pieces: Livre de guitare d√©di√© au roi (Paris, 1682) and Livre de pi√®ces pour la guitare (Paris, 1686). He also published a collection of pieces for the theorbo and lute: Pi√®ces de th√©orbe et de luth (Paris, 1716); these are in staff notation rather than tablature and may also be performed as ensemble pieces. The contents of all three books are tabulated with incipits and concordances in . He composed many other pieces for theorbo and Baroque lute (the bulk of which are preserved in the Saizenay Ms.).

It lies in the Province of Teramo in the Abruzzo region. A large spa development is planned following the discovery of mineral springs in the area in 1989. History The village of Collevecchio probably grew up on the piane before moving to its current hilltop location. Around 1927 a small church was constructed in the name of Saint Emygdius, under the supervision of architect Pio Ferretti. His brother Gregorio later served as priest in the church. In spite of this, in 1945 Gregorio was shot by local partisans for his support of the Fascists. Located in Piane di Collevecchio is an old water mill constructed in 1867 by Angelo Giuseppe and Francesco Salvi. Various members of the Salvi family kept the mill in operation until the year 1962. Today it is used mostly for school visits and educational purposes. Economy In 1989 springs containing salt and sulphurous waters were uncovered in this area. These thermal baths have received recognition from the local Italian Ministry and a large tourist centre devoted to their enjoyment has been planned. Such a development should bring much needed economic development to the surrounding area. Monastery At one time the ancient Monastery of Santa Maria was located in a deep hollow known as \\"Fosso dello Zolfo\\" (Sulphur Ditch). It must have been constructed on a very steep incline near the Vomano river. A neighborhood in this locality is still known as Santa Maria, referred to by others as San Martino. Over time the forces of erosion have washed away virtually all traces of this small church although some of the elderly residents of Piane di Collevecchio still speak of its presence. From time to time people who happen to be excavating in the area come across traces of the church, these thought to be omens of good luck. Festivals and events One prominent tradition in this hamlet is linked to memory of Saint Anthony. Groups of young people dress in the historical costumes and go from house to house singing traditional songs. In return, local food delicacies such as sausage, cheese, and eggs are requested. Another custom involves a game called rutula (the dialect word for ruzzola, meaning to roll). Spheres of wood or rubber (in the past cheese) are placed in the pouch of a sheppard's sling and hurled far through the air. Tournaments dedicated to this pastime are still held and an Italian rutula champion was recently crowned.

It is the largest area of lowland fen in Wales and lies immediately to the eastern side of Kilvey Hill just north of the industrial area of Crymlyn Burrows. Plantlife found in the bog is more typical of that found in East Anglia. Habitats range from swamps, carr (fen), water meadows and tall reed beds to waterlogged scrub consisting mainly of willow, where wetter areas merge with woodland. There are a number of plants found in the wetland that are rare in Great Britain. Examples of these include the slender cotton grass and lesser water plantain. In 2003, surveys of Crymlyn Bog, Pant-y-Sais Fen and the inter-connecting wetlands identified the area as one of only three locations in the UK at which the fen raft spider is found. The extent of the population is unknown but the quality of habitat at the site is considered good enough for the population to be stable. The reserve is a haven for birds. Predatory visitors like the hen harrier, buzzard, hobby and the occasional marsh harrier visit the site regularly. The site provides an important refuge for a range of wetland birds like the bittern, water rail, sedge and reed warblers, bearded tit and grey heron, which can often be seen or heard there. There is a visitor centre in the bog, which is frequented by nature and bird watching enthusiasts. History In previous inter-glacial periods the estuary of the River Clydach and River Neath once flowed through the valley now occupied by the wetland complex. Crymlyn Bog is an historic boundary between 'South' and 'West Wales', between the lordships of Glamorgan and Gower, and between the medieval and modern (i.e. until 1923) dioceses of St. David's and Llandaff. Part of the land was previously owned by a BP oil refinery where oil from the refinery spilt out into the wetland changing its ecology. Crymlyn Bog was largely owned by the CEGB who used the fen to dump waste PFA and in this same area Swansea City Council used it as a landfill site. Small parts were owned by the Neath and Tennant Canal Company and some sections of the canal are still clear of emergent vegetation. With the surrounding industrialisation, encroaching residential districts and a polluting landfill site beside it, it was uncertain that the bog would survive. Andrew Lees, who later became Campaigns Director of Friends of the Earth started a campaign with the Swansea branch of FoE to protect the bog. On an eastern limb of the bog is Pant-y-Sais fen, where there is a memorial to Mr Lees, which carries a quotation from him: \\"At some point I had to stand up and be counted. Who speaks for the butterflies?\\"  References  External links *JNCC: Crymlyn Bog * Site Kilvey Hill and Crymlyn Bog *Countryside Council for Wales: Crymlyn Bog *Swansea Green Map: Crymlyn Bog and Visitor Centre *Crymlyn Bog *www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Crymlyn Bog and surrounding area Category:Bogs of Wales Category:Wetlands of Neath Port Talbot Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in West Glamorgan Category:Nature reserves in Neath Port Talbot Category:National nature reserves in Wales Category:Ramsar sites in Wales ","title":"Crymlyn Bog"},{"id":"5679265","text":"Lily Jane Stead (born 15 August 1993) is a young English actress from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, best known for playing Kayleigh Gibbs on the ITV soap opera Emmerdale.

He is a senior research fellow in the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences, and Humanities at Cambridge University, Director of the Press Fellowship Programme at Wolfson College, Cambridge, Emeritus Professor of the Public Understanding of Technology at the British Open University, Adjunct Professor at University College, Cork and the Technology columnist of the London Observer newspaper. Naughton in 2011 Personal background John Naughton was born in 1946 in Ballina, County Mayo. He was educated at University College, Cork, and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, UK. He now lives and works in Cambridge. Intellectual background Starting as an electrical engineer who worked in systems modelling and analysis, Naughton subsequently developed an interest in the public understanding of technology and‚Äîlater‚Äîin the social, political, and cultural impact of internet technology. Academic career =The Open University= Naughton joined the Open University as a lecturer in Systems in 1972. He has made contributions (see e.g.) to the understanding and application of Soft Systems Analysis developed by Peter Checkland at Lancaster University. In addition to his work in systems analysis Naughton also made significant contributions to the public understanding of technology, initially as co-designer (with Professor Nigel Cross) of two incarnations of the University's Technology Foundation Course (T101 & T102) which, over its lifetime, introduced over 50,000 students to technological ideas. In the 1980s he was a key member of the team that introduced the use of personal computers into the University's teaching and learning system. In the 1990s, with colleagues Martin Weller and Garry Alexander, Naughton created the University's first major online course (You, your computer and the Net) which attracted 12,000 students per presentation in its early days and marked the beginning of the University's rise as a major provider of online education. (It now has approximately 250,000 online students.) In 2001 he set up the University's Relevant Knowledge programme‚Äîa suite of short online courses on topical technological issues and was Director of the programme until 2009. Naughton was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1980 and became Professor of the Public Understanding of Technology in July 2002. He retired from the Open University in 2011 and was appointed Emeritus Professor. =Other academic activities= In 1991, Naughton was elected a Fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge and in 1996 became Director of the college's Press Fellowship Programme, which brings journalists in mid-career from all over the world to Cambridge for a term to research a project of their own supervision. To date, the Programme has welcomed over 310 journalists from 46 countries. In 2008, he was appointed Academic Adviser to the Arcadia Project at Cambridge University Library. This was a project, sponsored by the Arcadia Fund, to explore the role of the academic library in a digital age. The project ran from 2008 to 2012 and supported 19 Arcadia Fellows and their associated projects. He was Vice-President of Wolfson College, Cambridge from 2011 to 2015. =Current research= In collaboration with Professor Sir Richard Evans and Dr David Runciman, Naughton is a Principal Investigator on a five-year research project on 'Conspiracy and Democracy' funded by the Leverhulme Trust. He is also co- Director (with Professor David Runciman) of the 'Technology and Democracy' project in the Cambridge Centre for Digital Knowledge. Both projects are based in CRASSH (the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences, and Humanities) at Cambridge University. Naughton is also a member of the Steering Group of the University's Strategic Research Initiative on Big Data. Journalistic career In the early 1970s, Naughton wrote for the political and cultural weekly, the New Statesman, mainly covering scientific issues. Between 1982 and 1987 he was Television Critic of The Listener, a weekly magazine published by the BBC which ceased publication in 1991.

He is known to be fluent in all of Talmud as well as many of the works of the later Rabbis such as Rabbi Joseph Rosen and Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk. He was gunned down by the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto. Biography Rabbi Ziemba was born in Praga, a suburb of Warsaw, in 1883. His father, Elazar, died while Menachem was still a young boy and the orphan was brought up by his grandfather Rabbi Avraham Ziemba. Rabbi Avraham had been a chassid of the Kotzker Rebbe and a student of the Chiddushei Harim, and was now a follower of the Sfas Emes of Gur. Rabbi Ziemba was brought up in the Gerrer chasidus by his grandfather and remained a loyal chasid his entire life. Even years later when he was world-renowned as a Torah scholar, Posek and master of Hasidic thought, he still considered himself a simple Chasid of the rebbe of Ger. When he visited Ger, he was called by his first name and refused to sit at the Rebbe's top table, an honour reserved for visitors of note. As Rabbi Ziemba grew up in Warsaw, he gained a reputation as a formidable Talmid Chacham (scholar) and dazzling genius. He maintained a unique correspondence with the Gaon of Rogatchov, a fiery individual not known for his tolerance of mediocrity, nor tolerance of younger students. At the age of eighteen, Rabbi Ziemba married the daughter of a wealthy local merchant. He was thus able to learn Torah unhindered for the next twenty years, a time remembered by him as the happiest years of his life. His fame spread further afield, attracting the attention of Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk and others. He once confided that he authored more than 10,000 pages of Torah novellae during this golden period. When his father-in-law died, Rabbi Ziemba found it necessary to help out in the former's store in order to continue supporting his family. He rejected numerous offers to serve as rabbi in many towns and cities, including Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem and Rabbi of Lublin, saying that he had more time to study while working than as a communal rabbi. However, at the request of his beloved Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi Ziemba entered communal affairs. He was appointed the representative of Praga to the Kehilla Council in Warsaw in 1935. Between 1930 and 1935, the world economic depression affected Rabbi Ziemba. His store was forced to close. He was offered the prestigious position of Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, but turned it down. After the untimely death of Rabbi Meir Shapiro, Rabbi Ziemba was offered the position as his successor as both Rabbi of Lublin and rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin. For unknown reasons, this never came to pass. In 1935 he, together with Rabbi Yaakov Myer Biderman, brother-in-law of the Gerrer Rebbe, and Rabbi Avraham Weinberg, was appointed to the Warsaw Rabbinate, becoming one of the foremost spokesmen for Orthodox Jewry in Poland. Aside from his newfound political prominence, Rabbi Ziemba became a Halachic decisor of great importance, answering questions from around the world, as well as from Poland. Rabbi Ziemba also took an active role in the Agudas Yisroel at an early stage. At its first Knessia Gedola (great gathering), he was not yet forty when chosen to serve as honorary secretary in the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. At the second Knessia Gedola, Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzenski agreed to serve as chairman of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah only if Rabbi Ziemba would continue in his position, while the forty- five-year-old Rabbi Ziemba felt himself to be too young and sought to stay in the background. At the third Knessiah Gedolah in 1937 in Marienbad, Austria, which played witness to the last massive gathering of European Orthodoxy before the Holocaust, Rabbi Ziemba was at the height of his fame. He spoke twice to the full assemblage and each time was greeted with hushed silence and awe. World War II In January 1943, in a meeting of the Warsaw Jewish leadership, Rabbi Ziemba proclaimed that traditional martyrdom (Kiddush HaShem-Sanctification of the Divine Name) was no longer an option as a response to Nazi persecution. He stated that \\"sanctification of the Divine Name\\" must be done through resistance to the enemy. He said to a group of ghetto leaders, > ‚ÄúIn the present we are faced by an arch foe, whose unparalleled ruthlessness > and total annihilation purposes know no bounds. Halachah [Jewish law] > demands that we fight and resist to the very end with unequaled > determination and valor for the sake of Sanctification of the Divine Name.‚Äù With the outbreak of World War II and the German invasion of Poland, Rabbi Ziemba became the single most important force in the Warsaw Ghetto. In the darkest days of despair, he was a source of hope, optimism and inspiration. He set up secret locations for the study of Torah, and at great personal risk, constantly visited these clandestine places to strengthen those who studied there. His wife died in the ghetto. Rabbi Ziemba was one of the few rabbinic leader who called for armed resistance. He redefined traditional martyrdom \\"Kiddush HaShem\\" as \\"Kiddush Ha'Chaim\\", the sanctification of life. According to scholar Pesach Schindler, Rabbi Ziemba summarized his idea of Kiddush Ha'Chaim when he begged for the Jews to resist right before the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in April 1943: > ‚ÄòThus, by the authority of the Torah of Israel, I insist that there is > absolutely no purpose nor any value of Kiddush Hashem inherent in the death > of a Jew. Kiddush Hashem in our present situation is embodied in the will of > a Jew to live. This struggle for aspiration and longing for life is a > mitzvah to be realized by means of nekamah, vengeance, mesiras nefesh, and > the sanctification of the mind and will.‚Äô Rabbi Ziemba was given two opportunities to escape from the ghetto. Through the efforts of Chaim Israel and the Sternbuch family of Switzerland, he was sent a Costa Rican passport and citizenship papers. His last name, however, was misspelled‚ÄîZiember instead of Ziemba. This was enough excuse for his papers to be declared void. In another incident, Rabbi Ziemba, along with the other two surviving members of the Warsaw Rabbinate, Rabbi Shimshon Sztokhamer and Rabbi David Shapiro, were suddenly summoned to the Judenrat. They were told that the Catholic Church was willing to rescue them. The three refused to go, saying that the existence of the Rabbinate gave Jews strength to carry on, although such a formality was no longer needed. Rabbi Ziemba established a committee to provide Pesach supplies for the Ghetto inhabitants. He was under constant surveillance by the authorities, and as such, could not become personally involved with the Ghetto underground. However, when money was needed to obtain ammunition, he was the first to donate, and added personal blessings to this resistance movement. He was one of the last three remaining rabbis in the Warsaw Ghetto with Rabbi Shimshon Sztokhamer (Samson Stockhammer) and Rabbi David Shapiro. Shortyl before the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising began the Archbishop of Warsaw offered the three rabbis refuge in his palace. After a brief discussion all three refused the offer, not wanting to abandon the Jews of the ghetto. Death The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising began soon before Pesach. While the battle raged around him, Rabbi Ziemba prepared himself for the coming holiday as if nothing was happening. In the evening, the fighting stopped and Ziemba conducted the Seder as though the times were normal. The next few days were spent in hideouts watching the ghetto being burned. The Nazis were methodically destroying the ghetto, house by house, in order to break the resistance. Among those burning were the houses around Kupiecka 7, including the building where Ziemba was holed up. With the air thick with smoke and nearly impossible to breathe, Ziemba and the people with him decided to try to run across the street, past SS men manning machine guns, to the building where the \\"Volia Rav\\", Rabbi Ber, was hiding. During a momentary lull in the shooting, when it seemed safe, Ziemba's daughter Rosa managed to run across first and then motioned to the others with her arm. Her signal was misunderstood. Believing it to be safe, Ziemba, holding his five- year-old grandson Yankele Ber by the hand, tried to make a run for dear life. Wild screams and gunfire ensued. Ziemba fell to the floor; the others retreated under the ferocious assault. The news of the Rabbi's death quickly spread to all neighboring hideouts. In spite of the great danger, a number of minyanim gathered. A Beth Din was set up, which decided to bury the Rabbi temporarily in a grave in the courtyard of Kupiecka 4. When the ghetto was finally liquidated, his entire immediate family was taken to Treblinka where they all perished. Postscript In 1958, upon learning that the Polish Government was planning to rebuild the area of the ghetto that included Rabbi Ziemba's grave, his nephews Rabbi Avraham and Rabbi Yitzchok Meir Ziemba (who were with him to the very end) and others expended great efforts to exhume his body and bring it to Israel. After weeks of work by surveyors and others, his grave was finally located‚Äîall landmarks remembered by the survivors had been destroyed in the interim. His body was flown to Israel and after a funeral attended by all the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah and tens of thousands of people, he was finally laid to rest on Har HaMenuchot.

It was one of the casualties of the four great fires (Chicago, Holland, Peshtigo, and Manistee) that ravaged the northern Midwest on October 8, 1871. Its ruins now lie buried beneath the sand dunes of the Lake Michigan shoreline at the mouth of the Kalamazoo River in Saugatuck Township, near the cities of Saugatuck and Douglas in Allegan County. It was founded in 1836 by New York land speculator Oshea Wilder, who was hoping to build a port town to rival Chicago and Milwaukee. At its height, the town boasted of three mills, two hotels, several general stores, a renowned bank, and was home to Michigan's first schoolhouse. In total, the town consisted of 23 buildings and two sawmills. The great bank scandal Dollar notes from Singapore, Michigan In 1838, two banks were established in Allegan County: the Bank of Allegan and the Bank of Singapore. Both were \\"of the famous wildcat species\\". By 1838, over $50,000 in Singapore Bank notes had been placed in circulation. Shortly after the Civil War, Singapore was involved in a bank scandal. State banks were required to maintain enough hard currency on hand to cover at least 1/3 of the banknotes that were circulating, and neither Singapore nor Allegan was at that level. From time to time collectors come across Singapore banknotes used by the Singapore Bank. There are a few known full sheets of the banknotes before they were cut into individual notes, sometimes signed and sometimes unsigned by the bank president or authorized personnel at the time. 40-day blizzard The 40-Day Blizzard of 1841 might very well have wiped out the people of Singapore, had it not been for the shipwreck of the Milwaukie just off her shore. The food with which that ship was stocked nourished the people of Singapore until the blizzard blew over. Change of ownership Wilder deserted the town in 1846, moving back to Calhoun County. James Carter of New York bought out Wilder's interest in the town and moved there to oversee his investment. It was only two years after that that Carter sold the town to his brother, Artemas. Artemas was more innovative than his brother, and very soon after arriving, built a three-masted schooner, dubbed the Octavia, to carry lumber from Singapore to Chicago over Lake Michigan. The town thrived and boasted a population of several hundred people by 1871. Singapore's demise Houses being covered by sand dunes After the fires which swept through Chicago, Holland, and Peshtigo in late 1871, Singapore was almost completely deforested supplying the three towns with lumber for rebuilding. Without the protective tree cover, the winds and sands coming off Lake Michigan quickly eroded the town into ruins and within four years had completely covered it over. The town was vacated by 1875. Today, Singapore lives on only in the name of the Singapore Yacht Club, which is at one end of town. Just as the \\"cow kicking over the lantern\\" story was born out of the Great Chicago Fire, this event also gave birth to a legend. The story persists that one resident of Singapore refused to move, even as the sand enveloped his home. Eventually, he had to enter and leave the dwelling by a second-floor window, and he stayed until the sand reached the roof.

The octopuses are most commonly killed before being cut into small pieces and served, with the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles making the pieces move posthumously on the plate whilst served. The octopus' highly complex nervous system, with two-thirds of its neurons localised in the nerve cords of its arms, lets the octopus show a variety of reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain. Less commonly, a live octopus is eaten whole. The dish is sprinkled with sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds. Eating Because the suction cups on the arm pieces are still active when the dish is served, special care should be taken when eating sannakji. The active suction cups can cause swallowed pieces of arm to stick to the mouth or throat. This can also present a choking hazard for some people, particularly if they are intoxicated. Language difference Vocabularies in the two Koreas differ on nakji: South Koreans call Octopus minor, a small kind of octopus (often mistranslated as \\"baby octopus\\") nakji, while North Koreans call a squid nakji (nakchi in McCune‚ÄìReischauer romanization). Prevalence Sannakji is served in Korean restaurants that serve sliced raw fish, but it also can be found at bars as a snack to accompany alcoholic beverages, such as soju. Health hazard Consuming sannakji is potentially dangerous due to choking hazard. Because the cephalopod's limbs contain neurons, the extremities continue to move and the suction cups along its tentacles maintain their gripping power that might attach to one's throat, even after getting detached from the body and doused with sesame oil. Several incidents of choking on Sannakji have been reported, such as a 2008 incident in Gwangju.Yonhap News 2008-01-21 Í¥ëÏ£ºÏÑú ÏÇ∞ÎÇôÏßÄ Î®πÎã§ Í∏∞ÎèÑÎßâÌûå ÏÇ¨Í≥† ÏûáÎî∞Îùº See also * Drunken shrimp, shrimp sometimes eaten alive in Chinese cuisine * Ikizukuri, the preparation of sashimi from living animals * Odori ebi, shrimp eaten alive in Japanese cuisine References Category:Korean cuisine Category:Octopus dishes Category:Cruelty to animals Category:Dishes involving the consumption of live animals Category:Potentially dangerous food ","title":"San-nakji"},{"id":"5679321","text":"Francesco Ruopolo (born 10 March 1983) is an Italian footballer who plays as a forward for AC Rezzato.

The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment is a China-based multinational particle physics project studying neutrinos. The multinational collaboration includes researchers from China, Chile, the United States, Taiwan (Republic of China), Russia, and the Czech Republic. The US side of the project is funded by the US Department of Energy's Office of High Energy Physics. It is situated at Daya Bay, approximately 52 kilometers northeast of Hong Kong and 45 kilometers east of Shenzhen. There is an affiliated project in the Aberdeen Tunnel Underground Laboratory in Hong Kong. The Aberdeen lab measures the neutrons produced by cosmic muons which may affect the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. The experiment consists of eight antineutrino detectors, clustered in three locations within of six nuclear reactors. Each detector consists of 20 tons of liquid scintillator (linear alkylbenzene doped with gadolinium) surrounded by photomultiplier tubes and shielding. A much larger follow-up is in development in the form of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) in Kaiping, which will use an acrylic sphere filled with 20,000 tons of liquid scintillator to detect reactor antineutrinos. Groundbreaking began 10 January 2015, with operation expected in 2020. Neutrino oscillations The experiment studies neutrino oscillations and is designed to measure the mixing angle Œ∏13 using antineutrinos produced by the reactors of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant and the Ling Ao Nuclear Power Plant. Scientists are also interested in whether neutrinos violate Charge-Parity conservation. On 8 March 2012, the Daya Bay collaboration announced a 5.2œÉ discovery of Œ∏13 ‚â† 0, with : \\\\sin^2 (2\\\\ \\\\theta_{13}) = 0.092 \\\\pm 0.016 \\\\, \\\\mathrm{(stat)} \\\\pm 0.005\\\\, \\\\mathrm{(syst)}. This significant result represents a new type of oscillation and is surprisingly large. It is consistent with earlier, less significant results by T2K, MINOS and Double Chooz. With Œ∏13 so large, NOŒΩA has about a 50% probability of being sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy. Experiments may also be able to probe CP violation among neutrinos. The collaboration produced an updated analysis of their results in 2014, which used the energy spectrum to improve the bounds on the mixing angle: : \\\\sin^2 (2\\\\ \\\\theta_{13}) = 0.090^{+0.008}_{-0.009} An independent measurement was also published using events from neutrons captured on hydrogen: :\\\\sin^2 (2\\\\ \\\\theta_{13}) = 0.083 \\\\pm 0.018. Daya Bay has used its data to search for signals of a light sterile neutrino, resulting in exclusions of some previous unexplored mass regions. At the Moriond 2015 physics conference a new best fit for mixing angle and mass difference was presented: :\\\\sin^2(2\\\\ \\\\theta_{13}) = 0.084 \\\\pm 0.005, \\\\qquad \\\\Delta m^2_{ee} = 2.44^{+0.10}_{-0.11} \\\\times 10^{-3} {\\\\rm eV}^2  Antineutrino spectrum  Daya Bay Collaboration measured the anti-neutrino energy spectrum, and found that anti-neutrinos at an energy of around 5 MeV are in excess relative to theoretical expectations. This unexpected disagreement between observation and predictions suggested that the Standard model of particle physics needs improvement.

The groups that play \\"ca√±onera\\" music include several Venezuelan rhythms like the Venezuelan merengue, a variant of the pasodoble, joropo, and Venezuelan waltz. As of 2017 there are only two groups dedicated to preserving the traditional music of Caracas: Los Anta√±os del Stadium (1946) and Los Ca√±oneros. Their most recent record is Esta es Caracas (2012), a Venezuelan merengue featuring some of the most important singers in Venezuela: Cecilia Todd, Horacio Blanco (lead vocal for the ska band Desorden Publico), Rams√©s Meneses a.k.a. McKlopedia, Aristides Barbella (), Max Pizzolante, Francisco Pacheco and Serenata Guayanesa. Their more successful songs include _La Burra_ \\"The Donkey\\", _La Ruperta_ \\", _El Romant√≥n_ and _Mataron al chivo_ \\"They Killed the Goat\\".

Site of the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus. He was thoroughly acquainted with the Christian history of Ephesus and the doings of the Phrygian Montanists. The unknown author of Praedestinatus says he was a Bishop of Ephesus.Unknown Author. Praedestinatus. I, 26, 27, 28; P.L., LIII, 596. However, the lack of support from other Christian writers makes this testimony doubtful. He undertook the defense of the Church against Montanus, and followed in the footsteps of Zoticus of Comanus, Julian of Apamaea, Sotas of Anchialus, and Apollinaris of Hierapolis. His work is cited by Eusebius,Church History, V, 18. and is praised by St. Jerome,De Viris Illustribus 40 but has been lost, and not even its title is known. It most likely showed the falsity of the Montanist prophecies, recounted the unedifying lives of Montanus and his prophetesses. It also gave currency to the report of their suicide by hanging, and threw light on some of the adepts of the sect, including the apostate Themison, and the pseudo-martyr Alexander. Themison, having evaded martyrdom by means of money, posed as an innovator, addressing a letter to his partisans after the manner of the Apostles, and finally blasphemed Christ and the Church. Alexander, a notorious thief, publicly condemned at Ephesus, had himself adored as a god. Based on Eusebius, it is known that Apollonius spoke in his work of Zoticus, who had tried to exorcise Maximilla, but had been prevented by Themison, and of the martyr-Bishop Thraseas, another adversary of Montanism. He likely gave the signal in it for the movement of opposition to Montanism which the reunion of the first synods developed. At all events, he recalls the tradition according to which Jesus had advised the Apostles not to go far from Jerusalem during the twelve years immediately following His Ascension, a tradition known to Clement of Alexandria from the apocryphal Praedicatio Petri. Moreover, he recounts the restoration to life of a dead man at Ephesus by the Apostle St. John, whose Apocalypse he knew and quotes. He takes rank among the opponents of Montanism with the \\"Anonymous\\" of Eusebius,Historia Ecclesiastica, V, 16, 17 with Miltiades and with Apollinaris. Eusebius says his work constituted \\"an abundant and excellent refutation of Montanism\\". St. Jerome qualified it as \\"a lengthy and remarkable volume\\". It did not therefore pass unnoticed, and roused some feeling among the Montanists since Tertullian felt it necessary to reply to it. After his six books peri ekstaseos, in which he apologized for the ecstasies into which the Montanist prophetesses fell before prophesying, Tertullian composed a seventh especially to refute Apollonius; he wrote it also in Greek for the use of the Asiatic Montanists.

Tangier disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter 1. Nat Genet 1999; 22:352. Worldwide, approximately 100 cases have even been identified. The disorder was originally discovered on Tangier Island off the coast of Virginia, but has now been identified in people from many different countries. Signs and symptoms Individuals that are homozygotes for Tangier's disease develop various cholesterol ester depositions. These are especially visible in the tonsils, as they may appear yellow/orange. The cholesterol esters may also be found in lymph nodes, bone marrow, the liver and spleen. Due to the cholesterol ester depositions the tonsils may be enlarged. Hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen) is common. Neuropathy and cardiovascular disease are the most devastating developments caused by Tangier's disease.Serfaty- Lacrosniere C, Civeira F, Lanzberg A, et al. Homozygous Tangier disease and cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis 1994;107:85-98. Genetics autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Mutations to chromosome 9q31 lead to a defective ABCA1 transporter. These mutations prevent the ABCA1 protein from effectively transporting cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells for pickup by ApoA1 in the bloodstream. This inability to transport cholesterol out of cells leads to a deficiency of high-density lipoproteins in the circulation, which is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. Additionally, the buildup of cholesterol in cells can be toxic, causing cell death or impaired function. These combined factors lead to the signs and symptoms of Tangier disease. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that for the phenotype to appear, two copies of the gene must be present in the genotype. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. Diagnosis Diffuse hazy opacity of the right cornea in a patient with Tangier disease. Tangier disease results in familial high-density lipoprotein deficiency. High-density lipoproteins are created when a protein in the bloodstream, Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), combines with cholesterol and phospholipids. The cholesterol and phospholipids used to form HDL originate from inside cells but are transported out of the cell into the blood via the ABCA1 transporter. People with Tangier disease have defective ABCA1 transporters resulting in a greatly reduced ability to transport cholesterol out of their cells, which leads to an accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids in many body tissues, which can cause them to increase in size. Reduced blood levels of high-density lipoproteins is sometimes described as hypoalphalipoproteinemia. People affected by this condition also have slightly elevated amounts of fat in the blood (mild hypertriglyceridemia) and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The tonsils are visibly affected by this disorder; they frequently appear orange or yellow and are extremely enlarged. Affected people often develop premature atherosclerosis, which is characterized by fatty deposits and scar-like tissue lining the arteries. Other signs of this condition may include an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), clouding of the cornea, and early-onset cardiovascular disease. Treatment There are drugs that can increase serum HDL such as niacin or gemfibrozil. While these drugs are useful for patients with hyperlipidemia, Tangier's disease patients do not benefit from these pharmaceutical interventions. Therefore, the only current treatment modality for Tangier's disease is diet modification. A low-fat diet can reduce some of the symptoms, especially those involving neuropathies.Serfaty-Lacrosniere C, Civeira F, Lanzberg A, et al. Homozygous Tangier disease and cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis 1994;107:85-98. History In 1959, a five-year-old patient named Teddy Laird from Tangier Island, Virginia, presented with strikingly large and yellow-orange tonsils which were removed by armed forces physicians. After initial diagnosis with Niemann-Pick he was transferred to Dr. Louis Avioli at the National Cancer Institute. Donald Fredrickson, then head of the Molecular Disease Branch, became aware of the case and had a hunch that the original diagnosis was incorrect. In 1960, he traveled with Dr. Avioli to Tangier Island for further investigation. After finding the same symptom in Teddy's sister, an investigation revealed an extremely high number of foam cells (cholesterol ester-laden macrophages) in not only the tonsils, but also in a wide-range of tissues, including the bone marrow and spleen. During a second trip to the island, they found that the family had very low levels of HDL cholesterol, suggesting a genetic basis of the disease.When a Gene Makes You Smell Like A Fish - Published 1990 Received From the Tangier History Museum\\" References  External links  * Category:Lipid metabolism disorders Category:Autosomal recessive disorders Category:Membrane transport protein disorders Category:Skin conditions resulting from errors in metabolism Category:Rare diseases ","title":"Tangier disease"},{"id":"5679365","text":"Lion Island can refer to: Places *Lion Island (New South Wales), an island in Broken Bay north of Sydney, Australia *Lion Island (Old Windsor), an uninhabited island in the River Thames, England *Lion Island, Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica *Lion Island, G√©ologie Archipelago, Antarctica *Lion Island, Victoria Land, Antarctica Other uses * Lion Island (band), a musical ensemble from Brisbane, Australia See also * Shi Islet (ÁçÖÂ∂º), or Lion Islet, Lieyu Township, Kinmen County (Quemoy), Fujian (Fukien), Republic of China (Taiwan) ","title":"Lion Island"},{"id":"5679366","text":"Joseph Roche may refer to: * Joe Roche (born 1967), Iraq War veteran and conservative commentator * Joseph Thomas Roche (1865‚Äì?), author and Roman Catholic priest ","title":"Joseph Roche"},{"id":"5679377","title":"Nostell Miners Welfare F.C."},{"id":"5679379","text":"The October 2005 issue of Scanorama with Fredrik Eklund on the cover Scanorama was the name of the award-winning inflight magazine of SAS.

Reozeboom, The Metallographist, 3, 293-300(1900). H. W. Bakhuis Roozeboom (, October 24, 1854 ‚Äì February 8, 1907) was a Dutch chemist who studied phase behaviour in physical chemistry. H. W. Bakhuis Roozeboom (originally \\"Bakhuys Roozeboom\\") was born in Alkmaar in the Netherlands. Financial difficulties did not allow him to directly pursue a university education, and he left school to work in a chemical factory for some time. Due to support from his mentor, J. M. van Bemmelen, he became an assistant at the University of Leiden in 1878, which enabled him to start his academic education there. In 1881 he became a teacher at a girls school, and in 1884 he obtained his PhD with works on the hydrates of acids. J. D. van der Waals introduced him to the theoretical works of J. Willard Gibbs on the phase rule which so far had little experimental verification in chemistry, prompting him to start a lifelong research programme on phase equilibria. In 1896, he became professor for chemistry in Amsterdam, where he died on February 8, 1907.J. M. van Bemmelen, W. P. Jorissen, W. E. Ringer, Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft, 1907, 40, 5141. His main work was in the field of thermodynamics, in which he studied the equilibrium of multiple-phase systems. The theoretical foundations for this were laid by J. Willard Gibbs with his phase rule, but Roozeboom would be the one to apply the theory and demonstrate its usefulness. He is mainly remembered for his melting phase diagrams of metal alloys, i.e. studying how mixtures of metals melt depending on the relative amounts of the components, which is important for metallurgy. Roozeboom also was the first to plot ternary phase equilibria in two- dimensional plots that were taken as vertical or horizontal slices from the three-dimensional solid diagrams. These are termed, respectively, isopleths and isotherms. He also contributed to the science of chiral substances, clarified how to distinguish the different types of crystalline racemates and predicted how mixtures of enantiomers behave in a heterogeneous system of solid and solution.H. W. B. Roozeboom, Zeitschrift f√ºr Physikalische Chemie, St√∂chiometrie und Verwandtschaftslehre, 1899, 28, 494-517. In 1890 Bakhuis Roozeboom became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Roozeboom succeeded J. H. van't Hoff at the University of Amsterdam. In 1904, he published the first volume and first part of the second volume of the multi-volume treatise on heterogeneous equilibria entitled Die Heterogenen Gleichgewichte von Standpunkte des Phasenlehre \\"Heterogeneous Equilibria from the Phase Rule Viewpoint.\\" In 1911, the Bakhuis Roozeboom Fund was established in his honour; every four years it awards a gold medal for research on phase theory.

His book \\"Isagoge breves\\" published in 1522 made him the most important anatomist before Andreas Vesalius.https://www.ustc.ac.uk/editions/813939 Early years Jacopo Berengario da Carpi was the son of a surgeon. As a youth he assisted his father in surgical work, and his surgical skills became the basis of his later work as a physician. In his late teens, through the association of his family with Lionello Pio, Berengario came under the tutelage of the great humanist printer, Aldo Manuzio who came to Carpi to tutor Alberto III Pio, Prince of Carpi and apparently included Berengario in his instruction. In the 1480s, Berengario attended university in Bologna receiving his degree in medicine in 1489. Fame through mercury cure for syphilis After obtaining his degree, Berengario returned to his father and assisted him with his surgery practice for a short time, but the influx of the \\"French disease\\" in 1494 provided Berengario with a chance to advance his career as a physician. Traveling to Rome, he treated several patients who suffered from the ailment. Judging by an admittedly one-sided account, his work in Rome was a mix of financial success and medical failure. As quoted in Lind's introduction to the Isagoge, Benvenuto Cellini provided a scathing account of Berengario's practice of treating syphilis with doses of mercury while charging \\"hundreds of crowns\\" paid in advance. Berengario apparently developed enough of a reputation that the Pope invited him into his service, but he turned down the offer and left Rome shortly thereafter. Anatomy in Bologna Isagogae Shortly after his work in Rome, he was appointed Maestro nello Studio at Bologna, a university whose faculty were only rarely foreign and then only when they were scholars of considerable reputations. Berengario‚Äôs reputation and personal connections with powerful patrons were indeed quite strong. In 1504, the Pope granted him Bolognese citizenship, and he was asked to treat distinguished patients on several occasions including Alessandro Soderini (relative of a Cardinal and part of the Medici family) in 1513 and Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino in 1517. Along with his reputation, Berengario increased his wealth becoming a collector of a variety of artworks including a Roman statue, a painting attributed to Raphael and a pair of vases by Cellini and eventually a house large enough to hold them all. By all accounts, Berengario was both a popular teacher and an accomplished cultivator of powerful friends. Official university records indicate his success as a teacher over one of his colleagues. He was adept enough at diplomacy to be made court surgeon to the Duke of Ferrara in 1529 after leaving Bologna despite having been condemned to pay a fine or have his nose cut off in 1500 for speaking insultingly of that ducal court. Berengario‚Äôs personality is commonly characterized by citing his tendency to violent confrontation. In 1511, he attacked and robbed a stipendiary of the Pope. Also in 1511, he attacked a doctor who sought refuge in a nearby house. The wife of the owner of the house was injured in the process. In 1520, for reasons not quite clear, Berengario along with an entourage attacked the home of Zambelli Petenghi with the intention of taking possession of it and killing its owner. Unable to gain entry, he was forced to content himself with doing damage to the house instead. Apparently due to his personal connections, he remained unpunished for any of his misdeeds. Legacy Berengario‚Äôs publishing record began in 1514 with an edition of Mondino. In 1518 he published his De fractura cranei and in 1521 his Commentary on Mondino. The Commentary was then supplemented by the Isagogae Breves in 1522 which was a greatly condensed version of the same work ‚Äúfor the common use of all good men‚Äù. Berengario made several important advances in anatomy including the first anatomical text augmented by illustrations, \\"Anatomia Carpi. Isagoge breves perlucide ac uberime, in Anatomiam humani corporis\\".https://www.nlm.nih.gov/dreamanatomy/da_g_I-A-1-02.html This book emphasized the sensory over textual versions of the truth, an emphasis on dissection of human cadavers, some first denials of Galenic anatomy based on personal experience in dissection, and a preference for dissection of numerous bodies following a specific program of investigation. Whereas other anatomists claimed few actual dissections to their name, in 1522 Berengario da Carpi claimed to have anatomized several hundred bodies. He also denied the existence of Galen's rete mirabile. Later Vesalius claimed he was the first to do so.

These are generally of Western origin, but have various degrees of Native American, African and Asian influence. Definitions of Latin America vary. From a cultural perspective,S√©rgio Campos Gon√ßalves, ‚ÄúCultura popular e suas representa√ß√µes: caminhos poss√≠veis de reflex√£o‚Äù, Revista Hist√≥ria em Reflex√£o - Programa de P√≥s-gradua√ß√£o em Hist√≥ria ‚Äì Faculdade de Ci√™ncias Humanas ‚Äì UFGD (Dourados), v. 2, p. 1-19, 2008. Latin America generally refers to those parts of the Americas whose cultural, religious and linguistic heritage can be traced to the Latin culture of the late Roman Empire. This would include areas where Spanish, Portuguese, French and various other Romance languages, which can trace their origin to the Vulgar Latin spoken in the late Roman Empire, are natively spoken. Such territories include almost all of Mexico, Central America and South America, with the exception of English or Dutch speaking territories. Culturally, it could also encompass the French derived culture in North America, as it ultimately derives from Latin Roman influence as well. There is also an important Latin American cultural presence in the United States since the 16th century in areas such as California, Florida and the Southwest, which were part of the Spanish Empire. More recently, in cities such as New York, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Miami. The richness of Latin American culture is the product of many influences, including: * Spanish and Portuguese culture, owing to the region's history of colonization, settlement and continued immigration from Spain and Portugal. All the core elements of Latin American culture are of Iberian origin, which is ultimately related to Western Culture. * Pre-Columbian cultures, whose importance is today particularly notable in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay. These cultures are central to indigenous communities such as the Quechua, Maya and Aymara. * 19th- and 20th-century European immigration from Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, France and Eastern Europe; which transformed the region and had an impact in countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil (particular the southeast and southern regions), Colombia, Cuba, Chile, Venezuela, Paraguay, Dominican Republic (specifically the northern region) and Mexico (particularly the northern region). * Chinese, Indian, Lebanese and other Arab, Armenian, Filipino, Korean, Japanese and various other Asian groups. Mostly immigrants and indentured laborers who arrived from the coolie trade and influenced the culture of Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Panama and Peru in areas such as food, art, and cultural trade. * The culture of Africa brought by Africans in the Trans- Atlantic slave trade has influenced various parts of Latin America. Influences are particularly strong in dance, music, cuisine, and some syncretic religions of Cuba, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Venezuela and coastal Colombia.  Ethnic groups  Latin America has a very diverse population with many ethnic groups and different ancestries. Most of the Amerindian descendants are of mixed race ancestry. In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries there was a flow of Iberian emigrants who left for Latin America. It was never a large movement of people but over the long period of time it had a major impact on Latin American populations: the Portuguese left for Brazil and the Spaniards left for Central and South America. Of the European immigrants, men greatly outnumbered women and many married natives. This resulted in a mixing of the Amerindians and Europeans and today their descendants are known as mestizos. Even Latin American criollos, of mainly European ancestry, usually have some native ancestry. Today, mestizos make up the majority of Latin America's population. Starting in the late 16th century, a large number of African slaves were brought to Latin America, especially to Brazil and the Caribbean. Nowadays, blacks make up the majority of the population in most Caribbean countries. Many of the African slaves in Latin America mixed with the Europeans and their descendants (known as mulattoes) make up the majority of the population in some countries, such as the Dominican Republic, and large percentages in Brazil, Colombia, etc. Mixes between the blacks and Amerindians also occurred, and their descendants are known as zambos. Many Latin American countries also have a substantial tri-racial population known as pardos, whose ancestry is a mix of Amerindians, Europeans and Africans. Large numbers of European immigrants arrived in Latin America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of them settling in the Southern Cone (Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil) and Northern Mexico. Nowadays the Southern Cone has a majority of people of largely European descent and in all more than 80% of Latin America's European population, which is mostly descended from six groups of immigrants: Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, French, Germans, Jews (both Ashkenazi and Sephardic) and, to a lesser extent, Irish, Poles, Greeks, Croats, Russians, Welsh, Ukrainians, etc. In this same period, immigrants came from the Middle East and Asia, including Indians, Lebanese, Syrians, Armenians, and, more recently, Koreans, Chinese and Japanese, mainly to Brazil. These people only make up a small percentage of Latin America's population but they have communities in the major cities. This diversity has profoundly influenced religion, music and politics. This cultural heritage is (arguably improperly) called Latin or Latino in American English. Outside of the United States, and in many languages (especially romance ones) \\"Latino\\" just means \\"Latin\\", referring to cultures and peoples that can trace their heritage back to the ancient Roman Empire. Latin American is the proper term. Romance languages in Latin America: Green-Spanish; Blue-French; Orange-Portuguese Language Spanish is spoken in Puerto Rico and eighteen sovereign nations (See Spanish language in the Americas). Portuguese is spoken primarily in Brazil (See Brazilian Portuguese). French is also spoken, in Haiti and French dependencies in the Caribbean. Several nations, especially in the Caribbean, have their own Creole languages, derived from European languages and various African tongues. Amerindian languages are spoken in many Latin American nations, mainly Chile, Panama, Ecuador, Guatemala, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Mexico. Nahuatl has more than a million speakers in Mexico. Although Mexico has almost 80 native languages across the country, the government nor the constitution specify an official language (not even Spanish), also, some regions of the nation do not speak any modern way of language and still preserve their ancient dialect without knowing any other language. Guaran√≠ is, along with Spanish, the official language of Paraguay, and is spoken by a majority of the population. Furthermore, there are about 10 million Quechua speakers in South America and Spain, but more than half of them live in Bolivia and Peru (approximately 6,700,800 individuals). Other European languages spoken include Italian in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, German in southern Brazil, southern Chile and Argentina, and Welsh in southern Argentina. Religion The Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida is the second largest in the world, after only of the Basilica of Saint Peter in Vatican City.Facts of Basilica of Aparecida The primary religion throughout Latin America is Christianity (90%),Christians ‚Äì Pew Research Center mostly Roman Catholicism. Latin America, and in particular Brazil, were active in developing the quasi- socialist Roman Catholic movement known as Liberation Theology. Practitioners of the Protestant, Pentecostal, Evangelical, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormon, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Bah√° º√≠, and indigenous denominations and religions exist. Various Afro-Latin American traditions, such as Santer√≠a, and Macumba, a tribal- voodoo religion, are also practiced. Evangelicalism in particular is increasing in popularity. Folklore Arts and leisure In long-term perspective, Britain's influence in Latin America was enormous after independence came in the 1820s. Britain deliberately sought to replace the Spanish and Portuguese in economic and cultural affairs. Military issues and colonization were minor factors. The influence was exerted through diplomacy, trade, banking, and investment in railways and mines. The English language and British cultural norms were transmitted by energetic young British business agents on temporary assignment in the major commercial centers, where they invited locals into the British leisure activities, such as organized sports, and into their transplanted cultural institutions such as schools and clubs. The British role never disappeared, but it faded rapidly after 1914 as the British cashed in their investments to pay for the Great War, and the United States, another Anglophone power, moved into the region with overwhelming force and similar cultural norms.Oliver Marshall, ed. English-Speaking Communities in Latin America (2000). =Sports= The British impact on sports was overwhelming, as Latin America took up football (called f√∫tbol in Spanish and futebol in Portuguese). In Argentina, rugby, polo, tennis and golf became important middle-class leisure pastimes. In some parts of the Caribbean and Central America baseball outshined soccer in terms of popularity. The sport started in the late 19th century when sugar companies imported cane cutters from the British Caribbean. During their free time, the workers would play cricket, but later, during the long period of US military occupation, cricket gave way to baseball, which rapidly assumed widespread popularity, although cricket remains the favorite in the British Caribbean. Baseball had the greatest following in those nations occupied at length by the US military, especially the Dominican Republic and Cuba, as well as Nicaragua, Panama, and Puerto Rico. Even Venezuela, which wasn't occupied by the US military during this time period, still became a popular baseball destination. All of these countries have emerged as sources of baseball talent, since many players hone their skills on local teams, or in ‚Äúacademies‚Äù managed by the US Major Leagues to cultivate the most promising young men for their own teams.Teresa A. Meade, History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present (2016), pp. 21‚Äì21. =Visual art= Beyond the rich tradition of indigenous art, the development of Latin American visual art owed much to the influence of Spanish, Portuguese and French Baroque painting, which in turn often followed the trends of the Italian Masters. In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early 20th century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their syncretic indigenous-European heritage and started to follow their own path. From the early 20th century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the Constructivist Movement. The Constructivist Movement was founded in Russia around 1913 by Vladimir Tatlin. The Movement quickly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America. Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a and Manuel Rend√≥n have been credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement into Latin America from Europe. An important artistic movement generated in Latin America is Muralism represented by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, Rufino Tamayo and many others in Mexico and Santiago Martinez Delgado, Pedro Nel G√≥mez in Colombia. Candido Portinari represented the monumentality of Muralism in his paintings, making chronicles the Brazilian people and their realities. Some of the most impressive muralist works can be found in Mexico, Colombia, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. Mexican painter Frida Kahlo remains by far the most known and famous Latin American artist. She painted about her own life and the Mexican culture in a style combining Realism, Symbolism and Surrealism. Kahlo's works commands the highest selling prices of all Latin American paintings.

Brazilian photography is one of the most creative in Latin America, growing in international prominence each year with exhibitions and publications. Photographers like Miguel Rio Branco, Vik Muniz, Sebasti√£o Salgado, and Guy Veloso have received recognition.[citation needed] =Literature= Pre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate codices. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the Popol Vuh. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the Quechua-speaking population of Peru and the Quich√© of Guatemala. From the very moment of Europe's \\"discovery\\" of the continent, early explorers and conquistadores produced written accounts and cr√≥nicas of their experience‚Äîsuch as Columbus's letters or Bernal D√≠az del Castillo's description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive criollo literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's El Periquillo Sarniento (1816). The 19th century was a period of \\"foundational fictions\\" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the Romantic or Naturalist traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of \\"civilization or barbarism\\" (for which see, say, Domingo Sarmiento's Facundo (1845), Juan Le√≥n Mera's Cumand√° (1879), or Euclides da Cunha's Os Sert√µes (1902)). At the turn of the 20th century, modernismo emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Rub√©n Dar√≠o's Azul (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. Jos√© Mart√≠, for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere. However, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary boom of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as Julio Cort√°zar's Rayuela (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's Cien a√±os de soledad (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with magic realism, though other important writers of the period such as Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was Augusto Roa Bastos's monumental Yo, el supremo (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as Juan Rulfo, Alejo Carpentier, and above all Jorge Luis Borges were also rediscovered. Contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling Paulo Coelho and Isabel Allende to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as Giannina Braschi, Diamela Eltit, Ricardo Piglia, Roberto Bola√±o or Daniel Sada. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of testimony, texts produced in collaboration with subaltern subjects such as Rigoberta Mench√∫. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic Carlos Monsiv√°is and Pedro Lemebel. The region boasts six Nobel Prizewinners: in addition to the Colombian Garc√≠a M√°rquez (1982), also the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral (1945), the Guatemalan novelist Miguel √Ångel Asturias (1967), the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (1971), the Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz (1990), and the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa (2010). =Philosophy= The history of Latin American philosophy is usefully divided into five periods: Pre- Columbian, Colonial, Independentist, Nationalist, and Contemporary (that is, the twentieth century to the present). Among the major Latin American philosophers is Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz (Mexico, 1651-1695), a philosopher, composer, poet of the Baroque period, and Hieronymite nun of New Spain (Mexico). Sor Juana was the first philosopher to question the status of the woman in Latin American society. When Catholic Church official instructed Sor Juana to abandon intellectual pursuits that were improper for a woman, Sor Juana's extensive answer defends rational equality between men and women, makes a powerful case for women's right to education, and develops an understanding of wisdom as a form of self-realization. Among the most prominent political philosophers in Latin America was Jos√© Mart√≠‚Äôs (Cuba 1854-1895), who pioneered Cuban liberal thought that lead to the Cuban War of Independence. Elsewhere in Latin America, during the 1870-1930 period, the philosophy of positivism or \\"cientificismo\\" associated with Auguste Comte in France and Herbert Spencer in England exerted an influence on intellectuals, experts and writers in the region.Gregory D. Gilson, and Irving W. Levinson, eds. Latin American Positivism: New Historical and Philosophic Essays (Lexington Books; 2012) Francisco Romero (Argentina 1891-1962) coined the phrase ‚Äòphilosophical normality‚Äô in 1940, in reference to philosophical thinking as ‚Äòan ordinary function of culture in Hispanic America.‚Äô Other Latin American philosophers of his era include Alejandro Korn (Argentina, 1860-1936) who authored ‚ÄòThe Creative Freedom‚Äô and Jos√© Vasconcelos (Mexico, 1882-1959) whose work spans metaphysics, aesthetics, and the philosophy of ‚Äòthe Mexican‚Äô. Poet and essayist Octavio Paz (1914-1998) was a Mexican diplomat, and poet, and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990. Paz who is one of the most influential writers on Latin American and Spanish culture from Sor Juana to Remedios Varos. More recent Latin American philosophers who practice Latina/o or Latinx philosophy include: Walter Mignolo (1941-), Maria Lugones (1948-), and Susana Nuccetelli (1954) from Argentina ; Jorge J. E. Gracia (1942), Gustavo P√©rez Firmat (1949) and Ofelia Schutte (1944) from Cuba; Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff (1955) from Panama; Giannina Braschi (1953) from Puerto Rico; and Eduardo Mendieta (1963) from Colombia. Their formats and styles of Latinx philosophical writing differ greatly as the subject matters. Walter Mignolo‚Äôs book \\"The Idea of Latin America\\" expounds on how the idea of Latin America and Latin American philosopher, as a precursor to Latinx philosophy, was formed and propagated. Giannina Braschi's writings on Puerto Rican independence focus on financial terrorism, debt, and ‚Äúfeardom‚Äù. Latina/o philosophy is a tradition of thought referring both to the work of many Latina/o philosophers in the United States and to a specific set of philosophical problems and method of questioning that relate to Latina/o identity as a hyphenated experience, borders, immigration, gender, race and ethnicity, feminism, and decoloniality. ‚ÄúLatina/o philosophy‚Äù is used by some to refer also to Latin American philosophy practiced within Latin America and the United States, while others argue that to maintain specificity Latina/o philosophy should only refer to a subset of Latin American philosophy. =Music= Latin American music comes in many varieties, from the simple, rural conjunto music of northern Mexico to the sophisticated habanera of Cuba, from the symphonies of Heitor Villa-Lobos to the simple and moving Andean flute. Music has played an important part in Latin America's turbulent recent history, for example the nueva canci√≥n movement. Latin music is very diverse, with the only truly unifying thread being the use of the Spanish language or, in Brazil, the similar Portuguese language.Morales, pg. xi Latin America can be divided into several musical areas. Andean music, for example, includes the countries of western South America, typically Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Venezuela; Central American music includes Nicaragua, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Caribbean music includes the Caribbean coast of Colombia, Panama, and many Spanish and French-speaking islands in the Caribbean, including French Guiana, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the less noted Martinique and Guadeloupe. The inclusion of the French West Indies varies by scholars. Brazil perhaps constitutes its own musical area, both because of its large size and incredible diversity as well as its unique history as a Portuguese colony. Musically, Latin America has also influenced its former colonial metropoles. Spanish music (and Portuguese music) and Latin American music strongly cross-fertilized each other, but Latin music also absorbed influences from the English-speaking world, as well as African music. One of the main characteristics of Latin American music is its diversity, from the lively rhythms of Central America and the Caribbean to the more austere sounds of southern South America. Another feature of Latin American music is its original blending of the variety of styles that arrived in The Americas and became influential, from the early Spanish and European Baroque to the different beats of the African rhythms. Latino-Caribbean music, such as salsa, merengue, bachata, etc., are styles of music that have been strongly influenced by African rhythms and melodies. Other musical genres of Latin America include the Argentine and Uruguayan tango, the Colombian cumbia and vallenato, Mexican ranchera, the Cuban salsa, bolero, rumba and mambo, Nicaraguan palo de mayo, Uruguayan candombe, the Panamanian cumbia, tamborito, saloma and pasillo, and the various styles of music from Pre-Columbian traditions that are widespread in the Andean region. In Brazil, samba, American jazz, European classical music and choro combined into bossa nova. Recently the Haitian kompa has become increasingly popular. The classical composer Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887‚Äì1959) worked on the recording of native musical traditions within his homeland of Brazil. The traditions of his homeland heavily influenced his classical works. Also notable is the much recent work of the Cuban Leo Brouwer and guitar work of the Venezuelan Antonio Lauro and the Paraguayan Agust√≠n Barrios. Arguably, the main contribution to music entered through folklore, where the true soul of the Latin American and Caribbean countries is expressed. Musicians such as Atahualpa Yupanqui, Violeta Parra, V√≠ctor Jara, Mercedes Sosa, Jorge Negrete, Caetano Veloso, Yma Sumac and others gave magnificent examples of the heights that this soul can reach, for example:the Uruguayan born and first Latin American musician to win an OSCAR prize, Jorge Drexler. Latin pop, including many forms of rock, is popular in Latin America today (see Spanish language rock and roll). =Film= Cineteca nacional in Mexico Latin American film is both rich and diverse. But the main centers of production have been Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba. Latin American cinema flourished after the introduction of sound, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border. The 1950s and 1960s saw a movement towards Third Cinema, led by the Argentine filmmakers Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino. More recently, a new style of directing and stories filmed has been tagged as \\"New Latin American Cinema.\\" Mexican movies from the Golden Era in the 1940s are significant examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years. More recently movies such as Amores Perros (2000) and Y tu mam√° tambi√©n (2001) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognised. Nonetheless, the country has also witnessed the rise of experimental filmmakers such as Carlos Reygadas and Fernando Eimbicke who focus on more universal themes and characters. Other important Mexican directors are Arturo Ripstein and Guillermo del Toro. Argentine cinema was a big industry in the first half of the 20th century. After a series of military governments that shackled culture in general, the industry re-emerged after the 1976‚Äì1983 military dictatorship to produce the Academy Award winner The Official Story in 1985. The Argentine economic crisis affected the production of films in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but many Argentine movies produced during those years were internationally acclaimed, including Plata Quemada (2000), Nueve reinas (2000), El abrazo partido (2004) and Roma (2004). In Brazil, the Cinema Novo movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States. Movies like Central do Brasil (1999) and Cidade de Deus (2003) have fans around the world, and its directors have taken part in American and European film projects. Cuban cinema has enjoyed much official support since the Cuban revolution, and important filmmakers include Tom√°s Guti√©rrez Alea. =Modern dance= Intermediate level international-style Latin dancing at the 2006 MIT ballroom dance competition. A judge stands in the foreground. Latin America has a strong tradition of evolving dance styles. Some of its dance and music is considered to emphasize sexuality, and have become popular outside of their countries of origin. Salsa and the more popular Latin dances were created and embraced into the culture in the early and middle 1900s and have since been able to retain their significance both in and outside the Americas. The mariachi bands of Mexico stirred up quick paced rhythms and playful movements at the same time that Cuba embraced similar musical and dance styles. Traditional dances were blended with new, modern ways of moving, evolving into a blended, more contemporary forms. Ballroom studios teach lessons on many Latin American dances. One can even find the cha-cha being done in honky-tonk country bars. Miami has been a large contributor of the United States‚Äô involvement in Latin dancing. With such a huge Puerto Rican and Cuban population one can find Latin dancing and music in the streets at any time of day or night. Some of the dances of Latin America are derived from and named for the type of music they are danced to. For example, mambo, salsa, cha-cha-cha, rumba, merengue, samba, flamenco, bachata, and, probably most recognizable, the tango are among the most popular. Each of the types of music has specific steps that go with the music, the counts, the rhythms, and the style. Modern Latin American dancing is very energetic. These dances primarily are performed with a partner as a social dance, but solo variations exist. The dances emphasize passionate hip movements and the connection between partners. Many of the dances are done in a close embrace while others are more traditional and similar to ballroom dancing, holding a stronger frame between the partners. =Theatre= Theatre in Latin America existed before the Europeans came to the continent. The natives of Latin America had their own rituals, festivals, and ceremonies. They involved dance, singing of poetry, song, theatrical skits, mime, acrobatics, and magic shows. The performers were trained; they wore costumes, masks, makeup, wigs. Platforms had been erected to enhance visibility. The ‚Äòsets‚Äô were decorated with branches from trees and other natural objects.Taylor, Diana. Theatre of Crisis: Drama and Politics in Latin America. University Press of Kentucky (Lexington: 1991). 23 The Europeans used this to their advantage. For the first fifty years after the Conquest the missionaries used theatre widely to spread the Christian doctrine to a population accustomed to the visual and oral quality of spectacle and thus maintaining a form of cultural hegemony. It was more effective to use the indigenous forms of communication than to put an end to the ‚Äòpagan‚Äô practices, the conquerors took out the content of the spectacles, retained the trappings, and used them to convey their own message.Taylor, Diana. 28. Pre-Hispanic rituals were how the indigenous came in contact with the divine. Spaniards used plays to Christianize and colonize the indigenous peoples of the Americas in the 16th century.Taylor, Diana. 1 Theatre was a potent tool in manipulating a population already accustomed to spectacle. Theatre became a tool for political hold on Latin America by colonialist theatre by using indigenous performance practices to manipulate the population.Vers√©nyi, Adam. Theatre in Latin America: Religion, Politics, and Culture from Cort√©s to the 1980s. Cambridge University Press (New York: 1993) 56. Theatre provided a way for the indigenous people were forced to participate in the drama of their own defeat. In 1599, the Jesuits even used cadavers of Native Americans to portray the dead in the staging of the final judgment.Taylor, Diana. 1. While the plays were promoting a new sacred order, their first priority was to support the new secular, political order. Theatre under the colonizers primarily at the service of the administration. After the large decrease in the native population, the indigenous consciousness and identity in theatre disappeared, though pieces did have indigenous elements to them.Taylor, Diana. 29. The theatre that progressed in Latin America is argued to be theatre that the conquerors brought to the Americas, not the theatre of the Americas.Taylor, Diana. 23. Progression in Postcolonial Latin American Theatre Internal strife and external interference have been the drive behind Latin American history which applies the same to theatre. 1959‚Äì1968: dramaturgical structures and structures of social projects leaned more toward constructing a more native Latin American base called the \\"Nuestra America\\" 1968‚Äì1974: Theatre tries to claim a more homogenous definition which brings in more European models. At this point, Latin American Theatre tried to connect to its historical roots. 1974‚Äì1984: The search for expression rooted in the history of Latin America became victims of exile and death.Pianca, Marina. \\"Postcolonial Discourse in Latin American Theatre\\". Theatre Journal. Vol. 41, No. 4, Theatre and Hegemony. (Dec., 1989), 515‚Äì523. Gold maize. Moche culture 300 A.D., Larco Museum, Lima, Peru. Latin American cuisine is a phrase that refers to typical foods, beverages, and cooking styles common to many of the countries and cultures in Latin America. Latin America is a very diverse area of land that holds various cuisines that vary from nation to nation. Some items typical of Latin American cuisine include maize-based dishes and drinks (tortillas, tamales, arepas, pupusas, chicha morada, chicha de jora) and various salsas and other condiments (guacamole, pico de gallo, mole). These spices are generally what give the Latin American cuisines a distinct flavor in penors; yet, each country of Latin America tends to use a different spice and those that share spices tend to use them at different quantities. Thus, this leads to a variety across the land. Meat is also greatly consumed and constitutes one of the main dishes in many Latin American countries where they are considered specialties, referred to as Asado or Churrasco. Latin American beverages are just as distinct as their foods. Some of the beverages can even date back to the times of the Native Americans. Some popular beverages include mate, Pisco Sour, horchata, chicha, atole, cacao and aguas frescas. Desserts in Latin America include dulce de leche, alfajor, arroz con leche, tres leches cake, Teja and flan. Regional cultures =Mexico= La Marcha de la Humanidad Monument to Cuauht√©moc, Mexico City Traditionally, Mexicans have struggled with the creation of a united identity. The issue is the main topic of Mexican Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz's book The Labyrinth of Solitude. Mexico is a large country with a large population, therefore having many cultural traits found only in some parts of the country. The north of Mexico is the least culturally diverse due to its very low Native American population and high density of those of European descent. Northern Mexicans are also more Americanized due to the common border with the United States. Central and southern Mexico is where many well-known traditions find their origin, therefore the people from this area are in a way the most traditional, but their collective personality can't be generalized. People from Puebla, for instance, are thought to be conservative and reserved, and just a few kilometers away, the people from Veracruz have the fame of being very outgoing and liberal. Chilangos (Mexico City natives) are believed to be a bit aggressive, and self-centered. The regiomontanos (from Monterrey) are thought to be rather proud, regardless of their social status. Almost every Mexican state has its own accent, making it fairly easy to distinguish the origin of someone by their use of language. A late 18th-century painting of Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz, Mexican poet and writer. The derogatory term naco was forged by the middle and upper-class Mexicans to refer to the native or mestizo population. The term allegedly comes from the word totonaco, which is one of the ethnic groups in Valle de Mexico. Its use has been made popular even among the poorest classes. Mexicans differ in opinion about the meaning of the word. Some would use it for a person who dresses in a tacky or tasteless manner, some use it to refer to the natives, some to the poor classes, and other for people with less education or culture and other ideology. The term fresa is in some terms the opposite of naco, and it is not always derogatory and means always some relative high economic status of the person termed in that way. Traditionally, people with more European looks and belonging to the middle or high classes are called fresas. Jarabe Tapat√≠o in the traditional China Poblana dress. Dancing and singing are commonly part of family gatherings, bringing the old and young together, no matter what kind of music is being played, like cumbia, salsa, merengue or the more Mexican banda. Dancing is a strong part of the culture. Mexicans in places like Guadalajara, Puebla, Monterrey, Mexico City, and most middle-sized cities, enjoy a great variety of options for leisure. Shopping centers are a favorite among families, since there has been an increasing number of new malls that cater to people of all ages and interests. A large number of them, have multiplex cinemas, international and local restaurants, food courts, cafes, bars, bookstores and most of the international renowned clothing brands are found too. Mexicans are prone to travel within their own country, making short weekend trips to a neighbouring city or town. An image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, patron saint of Mexico. The standard of living in Mexico is higher than most of the other countries in Latin America attracting migrants in search for better opportunities. With the recent economic growth, many high-income families live in single houses, commonly found within a gated community, called \\"fraccionamiento\\". The reason these places are the most popular among the middle and upper classes is that they offer a sense of security and provide social status. Swimming pools or golf clubs, and/or some other commodities are found in these fraccionamientos. Poorer Mexicans, by contrast, live a harsh life, although they share the importance they grant to family, friends and cultural habits. Mexican Stock Exchange Two of the major television networks based in Mexico are Televisa and TV Azteca. Soap operas (telenovelas) are translated to many languages and seen all over the world with renown names like Ver√≥nica Castro, Luc√≠a M√©ndez, Lucero, and Thal√≠a. Even Gael Garc√≠a Bernal and Diego Luna from Y tu mam√° tambi√©n and current Zegna model act in some of them. Some of their TV shows are modeled after American counterparts like Family Feud (100 Mexicanos Dijeron or \\"A hundred Mexicans said\\" in Spanish), Big Brother, American Idol, Saturday Night Live and others. Nationwide news shows like Las Noticias por Adela on Televisa resemble a hybrid between Donahue and Nightline. Local news shows are modeled after American counterparts like the Eyewitness News and Action News formats. Mexico's national sports are charreria and bullfighting. Ancient Mexicans played a ball game which still exists in Northwest Mexico (Sinaloa, the game is called Ulama), though it is not a popular sport any more. Most Mexicans enjoy watching bullfights. Almost all large cities have bullrings. Mexico City has the largest bullring in the world, which seats 55,000 people. But the favorite sport remains football (soccer) while baseball is also popular especially in the northern states because of the American influence, and a number of Mexicans have become stars in the US Major Leagues. Professional wrestling is shown on shows like Lucha Libre. American football is practiced at the major universities like UNAM. Basketball has also been gaining popularity, with a number of Mexican players having been drafted to play in the National Basketball Association. = Central America = Guatemala The fountain of \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de la Merced\\", Antigua Guatemala The culture of Guatemala reflects strong Mayan and Spanish influences and continues to be defined as a contrast between poor Mayan villagers in the rural highlands, and the urbanized and wealthy mestizos population who occupy the cities and surrounding agricultural plains. Fiambre, Guatemalan traditional dish, eaten on November 1, the Day of the Dead The cuisine of Guatemala reflects the multicultural nature of Guatemala, in that it involves food that differs in taste depending on the region. Guatemala has 22 departments (or divisions), each of which has very different food varieties. For example, Antigua Guatemala is well known for its candy which makes use of many local ingredients fruits, seeds and nuts along with honey, condensed milk and other traditional sweeteners. Antigua's candy is very popular when tourists visit the country for the first time and is a great choice in the search for new and interesting flavors. Many traditional foods are based on Maya cuisine and prominently feature corn, chiles and beans as key ingredients. Various dishes may have the same name as a dish from a neighboring country, but may in fact be quite different for example the enchilada or quesadilla, which are nothing like their Mexican counterparts. The music of Guatemala is diverse. Guatemala's national instrument is the marimba, an idiophone from the family of the xylophones, which is played all over the country, even in the remotest corners. Towns also have wind and percussion bands -week processions, as well as on other occasions. The Garifuna people of Afro-Caribbean descent, who are spread thinly on the northeastern Caribbean coast, have their own distinct varieties of popular and folk music. Cumbia, from the Colombian variety, is also very popular especially among the lower classes. Dozens of Rock bands have emerged in the last two decades, making rock music quite popular among young people. Guatemala also has an almost five-century-old tradition of art music, spanning from the first liturgical chant and polyphony introduced in 1524 to contemporary art music. Much of the music composed in Guatemala from the 16th century to the 19th century has only recently been unearthed by scholars and is being revived by performers. Guatemalan literature is famous around the world whether in the indigenous languages present in the country or in Spanish. Though there was likely literature in Guatemala before the arrival of the Spanish, all the texts that exist today were written after their arrival. The Popol Vuh is the most significant work of Guatemalan literature in the Quich√© language, and one of the most important of Pre-Columbian American literature. It is a compendium of Mayan stories and legends, aimed to preserve Mayan traditions. The first known version of this text dates from the 16th century and is written in Quich√© transcribed in Latin characters. It was translated into Spanish by the Dominican priest Francisco Xim√©nez in the beginning of the 18th century. Due to its combination of historical, mythical, and religious elements, it has been called the Mayan Bible. It is a vital document for understanding the culture of pre-Columbian America. The Rabinal Ach√≠ is a dramatic work consisting of dance and text that is preserved as it was originally represented. It is thought to date from the 15th century and narrates the mythical and dynastic origins of the Kek'chi' people and their relationships with neighboring peoples. The Rabinal Ach√≠ is performed during the Rabinal festival of January 25, the day of Saint Paul. It was declared a masterpiece of oral tradition of humanity by UNESCO in 2005. The 16th century saw the first native-born Guatemalan writers that wrote in Spanish. Major writers of this era include Sor Juana de Maldonado, considered the first poet- playwright of colonial Central America, and the historian Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzm√°n. The Jesuit Rafael Land√≠var (1731‚Äì1793) is considered as the first great Guatemalan poet. He was forced into exile by Carlos III. He traveled to Mexico and later to Italy, where he did. He originally wrote his Rusticatio Mexicana and his poems praising the bishop Figueredo y Victoria in Latin. Guatemalan girls in their traditional clothing from the town of Santa Catarina Palop√≥ on Lake Atitl√°n The Maya people are known for their brightly colored yarn-based textiles, which are woven into capes, shirts, blouses, huipiles and dresses. Each village has its own distinctive pattern, making it possible to distinguish a person's home town on sight. Women's clothing consists of a shirt and a long skirt. Roman Catholicism combined with the indigenous Maya religion is the unique syncretic religion which prevailed throughout the country and still does in the rural regions. Beginning from negligible roots prior to 1960, however, Protestant Pentecostalism has grown to become the predominant religion of Guatemala City and other urban centers and down to mid-sized towns. The unique religion is reflected in the local saint, Maxim√≥n, who is associated with the subterranean force of masculine fertility and prostitution. Always depicted in black, he wears a black hat and sits on a chair, often with a cigar placed in his mouth and a gun in his hand, with offerings of tobacco, alcohol and Coca-Cola at his feet. The locals know him as San Simon of Guatemala. Nicaragua Carnaval in Managua, Nicaragua Nicaraguan culture has several distinct strands. The Pacific coast has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by European culture but enriched with Amerindian sounds and flavors. The Pacific coast of the country was colonized by Spain and has a similar culture to other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. The Caribbean coast of the country, on the other hand, was once a British protectorate. English is still predominant in this region and spoken domestically along with Spanish and indigenous languages. Its culture is similar to that of Caribbean nations that were or are British possessions, such as Jamaica, Belize, The Cayman Islands, etc. Nicaraguan music is a mixture of indigenous and European, especially Spanish and to a lesser extent German, influences. The latter was a result of the German migration to the central-north regions of Las Segovias where Germans settled and brought with them polka music which influenced and evolved into Nicaraguan mazurka, polka and waltz. The Germans that migrated to Nicaragua are speculated to have been from the regions of Germany which were annexed to present-day Poland following the Second World War; hence the genres of mazurka, polka in addition to the waltz. One of the more famous composers of classical music and Nicaraguan waltz was Jose de la Cruz Mena who was actually not from the northern regions of Nicaragua but rather from the city of Leon in Nicaragua. More nationally identified, however, are musical instruments such as the marimba which is also common across Central America. The marimba of Nicaragua is uniquely played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. It is usually accompanied by a bass fiddle, guitar and guitarrilla (a small guitar like a mandolin). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music. The marimba is made with hardwood plates, placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four hammers. The Caribbean coast of Nicaragua is known for a lively, sensual form of dance music called Palo de Mayo. It is especially loud and celebrated during the Palo de Mayo festival in May The Garifuna community exists in Nicaragua and is known for its popular music called Punta. Literature of Nicaragua can be traced to pre-Columbian times with the myths and oral literature that formed the cosmogonic view of the world that indigenous people had. Some of these stories are still known in Nicaragua. Like many Latin American countries, the Spanish conquerors have had the most effect on both the culture and the literature. Nicaraguan literature is among the most important in Spanish language, with world-famous writers such as Rub√©n Dar√≠o who is regarded as the most important literary figure in Nicaragua, referred to as the \\"Father of Modernism\\" for leading the modernismo literary movement at the end of the 19th century. El G√ºeg√ºense is a satirical drama and was the first literary work of post-Columbian Nicaragua. It is regarded as one of Latin America's most distinctive colonial-era expressions and as Nicaragua's signature folkloric masterpiece combining music, dance and theater. The theatrical play was written by an anonymous author in the 16th century, making it one of the oldest indigenous theatrical/dance works of the Western Hemisphere. The story was published in a book in 1942 after many centuries. = South America = Andean states The Andes Region comprises roughly much of what is now Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia, and was the seat of the Inca Empire in the pre-Columbian era. As such, many of the traditions date back to Incan traditions. During the independization of the Americas many countries including Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador and Panama formed what was known as Gran Colombia, a federal republic that later dissolved, however, the people in these countries believe each other to be their brothers and sisters and as such share many traditions and festivals. Peru and Bolivia were also one single country until Bolivia declared its independence, nevertheless, both nations are close neighbors that have somewhat similar cultures. Bolivia and Peru both still have significant Native American populations (primarily Quechua and Aymara) which mixed Spanish cultural elements with their ancestors' traditions. The Spanish-speaking population mainly follows the Western customs. Important archaeological ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, ceramics, and weavings remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major Bolivian ruins include Tiwanaku, Samaipata, Incallajta, and Iskanwaya. The majority of the Ecuadorian population is mestizo, a mixture of both European and Amerindian ancestry, and much like their ancestry, the national culture is also a blend of these two sources, along with influences from slaves from Africa in the coastal region. 95% of Ecuadorians are Roman Catholic. =Peru= Marinera norte√±a, a Peruvian dance. Peruvian culture is primarily rooted in Amerindian and Spanish traditions,V√≠ctor Andr√©s Belaunde, Peruanidad, p. 472. though it has also been influenced by various African, Asian, and European ethnic groups. Peruvian artistic traditions date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of Pre-Inca cultures. The Incas maintained these crafts and made architectural achievements including the construction of Machu Picchu. Baroque art dominated in colonial times, though it was modified by native traditions.Gauvin Alexander Bailey, Art of colonial Latin America, pp. 72‚Äì74. During this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the Cuzco School are representative.Gauvin Alexander Bailey, Art of colonial Latin America, p. 263. Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of Indigenismo in the early 20th century.Edward Lucie-Smith, Latin American art of the 20th century, pp. 76‚Äì77, 145‚Äì146. Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been eclectic and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.Dami√°n Bay√≥n, \\"Art, c. 1920‚Äìc. 1980\\", pp. 425‚Äì428. Peruvian literature has its roots in the oral traditions of pre- Columbian civilizations. Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century, and colonial literary expression included chronicles and religious literature. After independence, Costumbrism and Romanticism became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of Ricardo Palma.Gerald Martin, \\"Literature, music and the visual arts, c. 1820‚Äì1870\\", pp. 37‚Äì39. In the early 20th century, the Indigenismo movement produced such writers as Ciro Alegr√≠a,Gerald Martin, \\"Narrative since c. 1920\\", pp. 151‚Äì152. Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas,Gerald Martin, \\"Narrative since c. 1920\\", pp. 178‚Äì179. and C√©sar Vallejo.Jaime Concha, \\"Poetry, c. 1920‚Äì1950\\", pp. 250‚Äì253. During the second half of the century, Peruvian literature became more widely known because of authors such as Mario Vargas Llosa, a leading member of the Latin American Boom.Gerald Martin, \\"Narrative since c. 1920\\", pp. 186‚Äì188. Peruvian cuisine is a blend of Amerindian and Spanish food with strong influences from African, Arab, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese cooking.Tony Custer, The Art of Peruvian Cuisine, pp. 17‚Äì22. Common dishes include anticuchos, ceviche, humitas, and pachamanca. Because of the variety of climates within Peru, a wide range of plants and animals are available for cooking.Tony Custer, The Art of Peruvian Cuisine, pp. 25‚Äì38. Peruvian cuisine has recently received acclaim due to its diversity of ingredients and techniques.Embassy of Peru in the United States, The Peruvian Gastronomy . Retrieved on May 15, 2007 Peruvian music has Andean, Spanish and African roots.Ra√∫l Romero, \\"Andean Peru\\", p. 385‚Äì386. In pre- Hispanic times, musical expressions varied widely from region to region; the quena and the tinya were two common instruments.Dale Olsen, Music of El Dorado, pp. 17‚Äì22. Spanish conquest brought the introduction of new instruments such as the guitar and the harp, as well as the development of crossbred instruments like the charango.Thomas Turino, \\"Charango\\", p. 340. African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the caj√≥n, a percussion instrument.Ra√∫l Romero, \\"La m√∫sica tradicional y popular\\", pp. 263‚Äì265.

Thanks partly to geography, Colombian culture has been heavily fragmented into five major cultural regions. Rural to urban migration and globalization have changed how many Colombians live and express themselves as large cities become melting pots of people (many of whom are refugees) from the various provinces. According to a study in late 2004 by the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Colombians are one of the happiest people in the world; this despite its four-decade long armed conflict involving the government, paramilitaries, drug lords, corruption and guerrillas like the FARC and ELN. Many aspects of Colombian culture can be traced back to the culture of Spain of the 16th century and its collision with Colombia's native civilizations (see: Muisca, Tayrona). The Spanish brought Catholicism, African slaves, the feudal encomienda system, and a caste system that favored European-born whites. After independence from Spain, the criollos struggled to establish a pluralistic political system between conservative and liberal ideals. Villa de Leyva, a historical and cultural landmark of Colombia Ethno- racial groups maintained their ancestral heritage culture: whites tried to keep themselves, despite the growing number of illegitimate children of mixed African or indigenous ancestry. These people were labeled with any number of descriptive names, derived from the casta system, such as mulato and moreno. Blacks and indigenous people of Colombia also mixed to form zambos creating a new ethno-racial group in society. This mix also created a fusion of cultures. Carnivals for example became an opportunity for all classes and colors to congregate without prejudice. The introduction of the bill of rights of men and the abolishment of slavery (1850) eased the segregationist tensions between the races, but the dominance of the whites prevailed and prevails to some extent to this day. The industrial revolution arrived relatively late at the beginning of the 20th century with the establishment of the Republic of Colombia. Colombians had a period of almost 50 years of relative peace interrupted only by a short armed conflict with Peru over the town of Leticia in 1932. Bogot√°, the principal city, was the World Book Capital in 2007, in 2008 by the Iberoamerican Theatrum Festival Bogot√° has been proclaimed as the world capital of theatre. =Venezuela= Instituto Arnoldo Gabald√≥n, declared August 30, 1984 as a National Historic Landmark Venezuelan culture has been shaped by indigenous, African and especially European Spanish. Before this period, indigenous culture was expressed in art (petroglyphs), crafts, architecture (shabonos), and social organization. Aboriginal culture was subsequently assimilated by Spaniards; over the years, the hybrid culture had diversified by region. At present the Indian influence is limited to a few words of vocabulary and gastronomy. The African influence in the same way, in addition to musical instruments like the drum. The Spanish influence was more important and in particular came from the regions of Andalusia and Extremadura, places of origin of most settlers in the Caribbean during the colonial era. As an example of this can include buildings, part of the music, the Catholic religion and language. Spanish influences are evident bullfights and certain features of the cuisine. Venezuela also enriched by other streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially France. In the last stage of the great cities and regions entered the U.S. oil source and demonstrations of the new immigration of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, increasing the already complex cultural mosaic. For example: From the United States comes the influence of the taste of baseball and modern architectural structures Venezuelan art is gaining prominence. Initially dominated by religious motifs, it began emphasizing historical and heroic representations in the late 19th century, a move led by Mart√≠n Tovar y Tovar. Modernism took over in the 20th century. Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Crist√≥bal Rojas, Armando Rever√≥n, Manuel Cabr√©, the kinetic artists Jes√∫s- Rafael Soto and Carlos Cruz-Diez. Since the middle of the 20th century, artists such as Jacobo Borges, R√©gulo Perez, Pedro Le√≥n Zapata, Harry Abend, Mario Abreu, Pancho Quilici, Carmelo Ni√±o and Angel Pe√±a emerged. They created a new plastic language. The 80s produced artist as Carlos Zerpa, Ernesto Le√≥n, Miguel Von Dangel, Mateo Manaure, Patricia Van Dalen, Mercedes Elena Gonzalez, Zacar√≠as Garc√≠a and Manuel Quintana Castillo. In more recent times, Venezuela produced a new diverse generation of innovating painters. Some of them are: Alejandro Bello, Edgard √Ålvarez Estrada, Gloria Fiallo, Felipe Herrera, Alberto Guacache and Morella Jurado. Venezuelan literature originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the mostly pre-literate indigenous societies; it was dominated by Spanish influences. Following the rise of political literature during the War of Independence, Venezuelan Romanticism, notably expounded by Juan Vicente Gonz√°lez, emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on narrative writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as Andr√©s Eloy Blanco and Ferm√≠n Toro. Major writers and novelists include R√≥mulo Gallegos, Teresa de la Parra, Arturo Uslar Pietri, Adriano Gonz√°lez Le√≥n, Miguel Otero Silva, and Mariano Pic√≥n Salas. The great poet and humanist Andr√©s Bello was also an educator and intellectual. Others, such as Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and Jos√© Gil Fortoul, contributed to Venezuelan Positivism. The Teresa Carre√±o Cultural Complex in Caracas The joropo, as depicted in a 1912 drawing by Eloy Palacios Carlos Ra√∫l Villanueva was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage Site) and its Aula Magna. Other notable architectural works include the Capitol, the Baralt Theatre, the Teresa Carre√±o Cultural Complex, and the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge. Baseball and football are Venezuela's most popular sports, and the Venezuela national football team, is passionately followed. Famous Venezuelan baseball players include Luis Aparicio (inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame), David (Dave) Concepci√≥n, Oswaldo (Ozzie) Guill√©n (current White Sox manager, World Series champion in 2005), Freddy Garcia, Andr√©s Galarraga, Omar Vizquel (an eleven-time Gold Glove winner), Luis Sojo, Miguel Cabrera, Bobby Abreu, F√©lix Hern√°ndez, Magglio Ord√≥√±ez, Ugueth Urbina, and Johan Santana (a two-time unanimously selected Cy Young Award winner).  Brazil  ;Theatre In the 19th century, Brazilian theatre began with romanticism along with a fervor for political independence.Piexoto, Fernando; Susaba Epstein; Richard Schechner. Brazilian Theatre and National Identity. TDR (1988), Vol. 34, No. 1. (Spring, 1990) 61 During this time, racial issues were discussed in contradictory terms, but even so there were some significant plays, including a series of popular comedies by Martins Penna, Franqa Junior, and Arthur Azevedo.Piexoto, Fernando. 61 In the 20th century, the two most important production centers for professional theatre were S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. They were centers of industrial and economic development. Even with the development of these two theatres, World War I brought an end to tours by European theatres so there were no productions in Brazil during this time. In November 1927, Alvaro Moreyra founded the Toy Theatre (Teatro de Brinquedo). Like this company, it was in the late 1920s when the first stable theatre companies formed around well-known actors. These actors were able to practice authentic Brazilian gestures gradually freed from Portuguese influence. Except for some political criticism in the low comedies, the dramas of this period were not popular. Occasionally the question of dependence on Europe or North America was raised. Even with more Latin American influence of theatre starting to filter in, its theatre still was under heavy influence of Europe. The Brazilian Comedy Theatre (Teatro Brasileiro de Com√©dia) was created in 1948 Oswald de Andrade wrote three plays; The King of the Candle (O Rei da Vela, 1933), The Man and the Horse (O Homem e o Cavalo, 1934). and The Dead Woman (A Morta, 1937). They were an attempt to deal with political themes, nationalism, and anti-imperialism. His theatre was inspired by Meyerhold's and Brecht's theories, with a political sarcasm like Mayakovsky.Piexoto, Fernando. 62 1943 at The Comedians: Polish director and refugee from the Nazis, Zbigniew Ziembinsky, staged in expressionist style Nelson Rodrigues' A Bride's Gown (Vestido de Noiva). With this production, Brazilian theatre moved into the modem period.Piexoto, Fernando. 63 World War II saw Brazil gain several foreign directors, especially from Italy, who wanted to make a theatre free from nationalistic overtones. Paradoxically, this led to a second renewal which engaged popular forms and sentiments; a renewal that was decidedly nationalistic with social and even communist leanings. During this time, the Stanislavsky system of acting was most popular and widely used. Stanislavski himself came to Brazil via Eugenio Kusnet, a Russian actor who had met him at the Moscow Art Theatre. The next phase was from 1958 to the signing of the Institutional Act Number Five in 1968. It marked the end of freedom and democracy. These ten years were the most productive of the century. During these years dramaturgy matured through the plays of Guarnieri, Vianinha, Boal, Dias Gomes, and Chico de Assis, as did mis-en-scene in the work of Boal, Jost Celso Martinez Correa, Flivio Rangel, and Antunes Filho. During this decade a generation accepted theatre as an activity with social responsibility.Piexoto, Fernando. 65 At its height, this phase of Brazilian theatre was characterized by an affirmation of national values. Actors and directors became political activists who risked their jobs and lives daily.Piexoto, Fernando. 66 Through this growth of Latin America politically and the influence of European theatre, an identity of what is theatre in Latin America stemmed out of it. ;Modern painting Modern painting in Brazil was born during Modern Art Week in 1922. Artists who have excelled in 20th century Brazilian art include Tarsila do Amaral, Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, and Candido Portinari. Portinari was influenced by Cubism and Expressionism and is the painter of War and Peace, a panel at the United Nations in New York. ;Photography Holy week, Ouro Preto- MG, 2010. Chrome.

The museum is an institution that collects and preserves historic objects, commemorates and educates, with a mission to challenge visitors‚Äô perceptions of morality, social justice, democracy and human rights. The Sydney Jewish Museum is located at 148 Darlinghurst Road, Darlinghurst, and is housed in the historic Maccabean Hall, which was built to commemorate Jewish men and women from New South Wales who served in World War I. This building, which was formally opened on Armistice Day 1923 by Sir John Monash, has long been a hub of Jewish life in Sydney and was judged an appropriate site for the Sydney Jewish Museum. 26 years since its inception, the Museum continues to give a voice to the victims of the Holocaust so their stories can start conversations and inspire change. The Sydney Jewish Museum‚Äôs tagline, ‚ÄúWhere history has a voice‚Äù, distills the origins of the Museum and its mission that continues to carry it forward into the future. The objects within the collection and on display in the Museum‚Äôs exhibitions tell the stories of their owners and contribute to the narratives that the Museum tells within its walls. Testimony, accessible digitally and face-to-face, anchors the objects in the display cases to real world events, and gives life and narrative to history. The Holocaust exhibition  Establishment  The Sydney Jewish Museum was established in 1992 by the generation of Holocaust survivors who came to Australia. They envisioned the Museum as a place which could hold their stories and personal objects, memorialise those who were murdered during the Holocaust, and within which the lessons from the past would be taught. The museum was officially opened by Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair , the Governor of New South Wales, on 18 November 1992. The museum was founded by the late John Saunders and members of the Australian Association of Jewish Holocaust Survivors. Australia has a higher proportion of Holocaust survivors (per capita) than any country except Israel.  Exhibitions  Within three major exhibition spaces, visitors are able to confront historical artefacts, video footage, new digital technologies and personal stories. The permanent exhibitions include: = Culture and Continuity: Journey through Judaism = This exhibition on the Museum's Ground Floor explores Jewish history from Biblical origin in the Ancient Near East to the thriving Jewish community in Australia. = Serving Australia: The Jewish Involvement in Australian Military History = Serving Australia portrays the stories of Jewish servicemen and women in the Australian defence forces from its inception to the present. Reflecting the dedication, valour and patriotism of the greater Australian community, this exhibition features the social- military history of Jewish men and women in time of war. = The Holocaust = Located over three levels, this exhibition traces the persecution and murder of European Jewry from 1933 to 1945 and explores the contemporary and ongoing resonance of these unprecedented events. The exhibition also recounts the new lives forged by survivors following their arrival in Australia and their contribution to the rich, multicultural fabric of contemporary Australian life. = The Holocaust and Human Rights = A capstone to the Holocaust exhibition, The Holocaust and Human Rights Exhibition outlines human rights achievements and challenges, and focuses on the key human rights issues facing Australia today. The exhibition uses interactive media and new digital technologies to explore local issues pertaining to the rights of Refugees and Asylum Seekers; People with Disabilities; First Australians; and the LGBTIQ Community. The place promotes deep, reflective thought, even on topics that might prove irresolvable.The museum also has a program of regularly changing feature exhibitions.  Resource Centre and Library  The museum library was created from the entire collection of books donated by Australian Association of Jewish Holocaust Survivors. Since then, the Resource Centre and Library has grown to over 6000 volumes, journals, audio and videotapes, including over 2,500 personal testimonies of Holocaust survivors in Australia. The centre is open to the public during museum hours and staffed by a librarian. The collection provides material for the exhibitions and covers a wide range of themes including antisemitism, war crimes, holocaust in art and literature, and Australian Jewish history.

It was formed by first crossbreeding Beef Shorthorn with Highland cattle and then breeding the resulting progeny with Beef Shorthorns to produce an animal three quarters Beef Shorthorn, one quarter Highland. The breed of red-brown cattle are moderately sized and extremely hardy. The intent was to produce a good beef cow with the ability to raise a calf under adverse weather conditions. It was officially recognised as a breed by the British government in 1965. The breed is still farmed today, mainly in Scotland but also in other areas of the world.  History  Luings were first created by the Cadzow brothers; Ralph, Denis and Shane, in 1947. They crossbred two types of cattle to produce the Luing; the Highland as the heifer and the Beef Shorthorn as the bull, and were the first new breed of cattle developed in Britain in over 100 years. The Highland was chosen as it contributes the hardiness that we see in the breed today and the Shorthorn because of its fleshing qualities and flavour of meat. Through a breeding programme, the three sons established the breed that we have today. In 1965, the breed was officially recognised by the British Government. = Today = The Cadzow family continue to farm on Luing and the breed remains popular on the surrounding isles, including Scarba and Torsa. The breed has been exported to countries across the world including Canada and New Zealand, and is highly regarded for hardiness and ease of handling and marbling of its meat.  Characteristics  The average Luing cow will give birth to 10 calves in a lifetime because of their longevity. This has been attributed to the traits inherited from their Highland cattle ancestors. They typically have hair of a medium length and a red or dun coloured coat.

Rather than seeing the relationship between practice and theory as a dichotomy, as has sometimes traditionally been the case (see academia: theory and practice heading), there is a growing body of practice research academics across a number of disciplines who use practice as part of their research. For example, the practice-based research network (PBRN) within clinical medical research. Practice-led research in the arts and design Within arts and humanities departments there are ongoing debates about how to define this emerging research phenomenon, and there are a variety of models of practice research (practice-as-research, practice-based, practice-led, mixed-mode research practice and practice through research), see for example screen media practice research. The potential, nature and scope for this research has been debated from the 1990s. Sir Christopher Frayling in 1993 adapted Herbert Read's model of education through art to describe different ways of thinking about research, noting that research could be FOR practice, where research aims are subservient to practice aims, THROUGH practice, where the practice serves a research purpose, or INTO practice, such as observing the working processes of others.Frayling, C. (1993) Research in art and design. Royal College of Art: Research Paper Bruce Archer's statement in 1995 shows the growing recognition of arts practice as research at this time, \\"There are circumstances where the best or only way to shed light on a proposition, a principle, a material, a process or a function is to attempt to construct something, or to enact something, calculated to explore, embody or test it.\\".Archer, B. (1995) The Nature of Research Co-Design Jan 95 6-13 This led to the acceptance of practice research in these disciplines to be reviewed alongside traditional research disciplines in the sphere of Higher Education a debate supported by the work of Michael Biggs, John Freeman, Kristina Niedderer, Katy Macleod, Darren Newbury and others. The UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council had a steering committee devoted to practice-led research and its report was completed in September 2007.,AHRC Research Review: Practice-Led Research in Art, Design and Architecture (2007) Rust, Prof Chris, Mottram, Prof Judith, Till, Prof Jeremy, with support from Kirsty Smart, Peter Walters Mark Elshaw titled AHRC Research Review in Practice-Led Research in Art, Design and Architecture (Rust, Mottram, Till). This informed continuing discussions by the Council for Higher Education in Art & Design (CHEAD) and the AHRC resulting in an evolved notion of practice as research in art, design and architecture, media, and creative writing. This in turn brought an increasing recognition in the UK of the ways in which creative departments contribute to research culture, a potential which informs elements of the Research Excellence Framework 2014.

Born 16 July 1784 in Gardner, Massachusetts to Elijah and Azubah (Wells) Wilder, he initially made his living as a blacksmith before entering the military to fight in the War of 1812. On 4 February 1813, Wilder married Cornelia Anthony (1791‚Äì1866), daughter of John and Sarah (Shaw) Anthony. In the 1820s, they toured Europe, settling in New York upon their return to the United States. Michigan Pioneer In 1831, the Wilders pioneered the area around present- day Marshall, Michigan in Calhoun County where Oshea worked as a land surveyor. The same year, the Ketchum Brothers arrived from New York, and Wilder assisted them in the founding of the village of Marshall. By 1835, the Village of Marshall had a population of 300. In 1834, Michigan territorial governor Stevens T. Mason appointed him to a three-person committee to determine Allegan County's county seat. In 1836, he purchased a plot of land in Allegan County, along the shore of Lake Michigan. On that land, he established the village of Singapore. One early feature of the town was that it had its own bank. Michigan law required that banks have funds enough on hand to cover at least 1/3 of bank notes that it printed. By 1838, over $50,000 in Singapore Bank notes had been placed in circulation. Wilder deserted the town in 1846, moving back to Calhoun County.

The compound is usually sold as a mixture of the E- and Z-isomers, which differ with respect to the relative position of the methyl and formyl groups. The E-isomer is more common (data given in Table is for the E-isomer). This lachrymatory liquid is moderately soluble in water and miscible in organic solvents. As an unsaturated aldehyde, crotonaldehyde is a versatile intermediate in organic synthesis. It occurs in a variety of foodstuffs, e.g. soybean oils. Production and uses Crotonaldehyde is produced by the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde: :2 CH3CHO ‚Üí CH3CH=CHCHO + H2O Its main application is as a precursor to fine chemicals. Sorbic acid, a food preservative, and trimethylhydroquinone, a precursor to the vitamin E, are prepared from crotonaldehyde. Other derivatives include crotonic acid and 3-methoxybutanol. Crotonaldehyde is a multifunctional molecule that exhibits diverse reactivity. It is an excellent prochiral dienophile. It is a Michael acceptor. Addition of methylmagnesium chloride produces 3-penten-2-ol. The reaction of crotonaldehyde with ethanol then gives kethoxal (anhydrous). Polyurethane catalyst N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,4-butanediamine (also known as TMBDA) is obtained by hydrogenating N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,4-butenediamine which is a reaction product of crotonaldehyde and dimethylamine.https://jadedman.wordpress.com/2011/01/08/catalysts/ Safety Crotonaldehyde is an irritant.

Scuttled in 1940, the wreck presently lies in of water off Glenbrook, Nevada. The wreck was first visited in 2002 by a team from New Millennium Dive Expeditions (NMDE) in a record-setting high- altitude dive for Lake Tahoe. As a result of the work that NMDE did on the Tahoe site from 1999 up to their dives in 2002, Tahoe became the first maritime site in Nevada to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Service history By the end of the 19th century, Lake Tahoe had become known as a vacation resort, with a handful of hotels and communities scattered around its shores, serviced by a number of steamers crossing the lake. Lumber magnate Duane Leroy Bliss ordered the vessel from San Francisco's Union Iron Works in 1894. It was shipped by rail in pieces to Carson City, then by wagon to Glenbrook, reassembled, and launched with much acclaim on June 24, 1896. At , Tahoe was the largest of the lake steamers; she was propelled by two wood-fired engines developing a total of , each driving a three-bladed propeller. Her 200 passengers enjoyed a well-appointed interior, with leather upholstery, carpeting, and marble fixtures in the lavatories. Modern technologies included electric lights and bells, hot and cold running water and steam heating. From 1901, Tahoe operated from a railroad pier in Tahoe City during the summer, leaving in the morning, making a daily circuit of the shoreline communities, and returning in late afternoon. In addition to the passengers, she carried freight and mail. The completion of a road suitable for cars all around the lake in 1934-35, followed by the loss of the mail contract in 1934 to Marian B, made Tahoe uneconomical to operate, and she lay unused for several years. In 1940, Bliss's son William Seth Bliss repurchased the vessel from the operating company; his intent was scuttle her in shallow water off Glenbrook as a memorial to a bygone era, visible to glass-bottomed boats. Tahoe was scuttled on August 29, 1940, but the underwater slope was unexpectedly steep at the chosen location, and the ship slid down out of sight, ending up with the bow at and the stern at . Wreck discovery In 2002, the Reno-based non-profit organization New Millennium Dive Expeditions set a record for high altitude scuba diving when they reached the wreck of Tahoe. The information they gathered on the wreck was a crucial part of the documentation enabling Tahoe to be listed on the National Register. The work of the NMDE team continued in 2009 where in August and September they visited the wreck again successfully in preparation for three visits in the summer of 2010. In July 2016 the vessel was filmed by an underwater drone or remote vehicle as part of a project to develop such devices cheaply.

Since Poland's administrative reorganization in 1999, ≈ªabno has been a part of Tarn√≥w powiat which belongs to Lesser Poland Voivodeship. Before administrative reorganization in 1999 it belonged to the Tarn√≥w Voivodeship. History First recorded mentioning of ≈ªabno dates back to the 12th century, when Prince Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste granted the settlement to a knight known as ≈öwiƒôtos≈Çaw. It became a center of communication and trade, due to a convenient location along a merchant route from Wojnicz and Pilzno, to Opatowiec and Nowy Korczyn. It is not known when ≈ªabno received its town charter. This must have happened before the year 1385, as on January 26 of that year, Queen Jadwiga of Poland, upon request of Spytek of Melsztyn, confirmed ≈ªabno's Magdeburg rights. Little is known about town's early history, as few documents have been preserved. One of the few established facts is that in 1394, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço visited the town with his court, on the way to Nowy Korczyn. In the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, the town belonged to the Sandomierz Voivodeship, and was part of the County of Wi≈õlica. Church of the Holy Spirit By the 15th century there were two churches at ≈ªabno, 'Church of the Holy Spirit' and the 'Church of the Holy Cross'. At the same time, first artisans opened their workshops here. Every week markets took place at ≈ªabno, with the first one organized in the year 1487, after the town had received a royal privilege. The tradition of the markets still remains. The town was destroyed numerous times, in 1501 it was burned by the Tatars, and in 1656, it was completely destroyed in the Swedish invasion of Poland, when Transilvanian-Cossack army of George II Rakoczi, which was allied with the Swedish Empire, burned it to the ground. In 1772, after the first partition of Poland, ≈ªabno became part of the Austrian province of Galicia, where it remained until late 1918. In 1799, a great fire burned almost all of the town. Market square In the 19th century ≈ªabno remained a small town, which in 1906 received a rail connection with Tarn√≥w, due to a secondary-importance line from Tarn√≥w to Szczucin. First local industrial facility was a brick making factory which opened in 1905. In the early 20th century the town began a slow process of development, which was stopped by World War I, when the frontline for several months remained along the Dunajec river, which brought widespread destruction. In the Second Polish Republic, ≈ªabno belonged to Krak√≥w Voivodeship. The town suffered greatly in the 1934 flood in Poland, and during World War II, around 2000 people were sent to a work in labor camps in Germany. 30 people were sent to a concentration camp during the war out of which only 4 returned. ≈ªabno's Jewish community perished in the Holocaust. Modern ≈ªabno The latest Census on December 31, 2006 gave the population as 4262 inhabitants. Currently ≈ªabno is a town with a small-scale industrial capacity. Local industry mainly consists of metalworks and window manufacturing. The Tarn√≥w-Szczucin railway runs through the town.

High-resolution schemes are used in the numerical solution of partial differential equations where high accuracy is required in the presence of shocks or discontinuities. They have the following properties: *Second- or higher-order spatial accuracy is obtained in smooth parts of the solution. *Solutions are free from spurious oscillations or wiggles. *High accuracy is obtained around shocks and discontinuities. *The number of mesh points containing the wave is small compared with a first-order scheme with similar accuracy. General methods are often not adequate for accurate resolution of steep gradient phenomena; they usually introduce non-physical effects such as smearing of the solution or spurious oscillations. Since publication of Godunov's order barrier theorem, which proved that linear methods cannot provide non-oscillatory solutions higher than first order (Godunov 1954, Godunov 1959), these difficulties have attracted much attention and a number of techniques have been developed that largely overcome these problems. To avoid spurious or non-physical oscillations where shocks are present, schemes that exhibit a Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) characteristic are especially attractive. Two techniques that are proving to be particularly effective are MUSCL (Monotone Upstream- Centered Schemes for Conservation Laws), a flux/slope limiter method (van Leer 1979, Hirsch 1990, Tannehill 1997, Laney 1998, Toro 1999) and the WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) method (Shu 1998, Shu 2009). Both methods are usually referred to as high resolution schemes (see diagram). MUSCL methods are generally second-order accurate in smooth regions (although they can be formulated for higher orders) and provide good resolution, monotonic solutions around discontinuities. They are straightforward to implement and are computationally efficient. For problems comprising both shocks and complex smooth solution structure, WENO schemes can provide higher accuracy than second-order schemes along with good resolution around discontinuities. Most applications tend to use a fifth order accurate WENO scheme, whilst higher order schemes can be used where the problem demands improved accuracy in smooth regions. The method of holistic discretisation systematically analyses subgrid scale dynamics to algebraically construct closures for numerical discretisations that are both accurate to any specified order of error in smooth regions, and automatically adapt to cater for rapid grid variations through the algebraic learning of subgrid structures (Roberts 2003).

It was the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award winner for general nonfiction. A 2007 drama-documentary was based on it. Synopsis Rough Crossings gives an account of the history of thousands of slaves who escaped to fight for the British cause during the American Revolutionary War. It tells of the legal battles that established that slavery was not valid in England itself, and how the British government offered freedom to enslaved African Americans if they would fight for Britain and King George III. The book discusses the many ambiguities involved‚Äîsome white Loyalists were slave-owners, some blacks were recruited for the War of Independence. Rough Crossings then follows the subsequent fate of the Black Loyalists, many of them escaped slaves, who, after the British defeat, were sent to Nova Scotia (then still a colony within British North America), where they received a cold welcome, including suffering the first race riots on the continent. Some stayed there, but others settled in what was to become Sierra Leone. The descendants of those who settled in Freetown are part of the Sierra Leone Creole people, with strong ancestral ties with the United States, the Caribbean, and Canada. Reception The reviews were very favourable. Alex Butterworth wrote in The Guardian: > The early chapters of Rough Crossings still bear traces of the television > habit - the scene-setting rhetoric, a tendency to over-emphasis [sic] vivid > 'moments', precise character thumbnail ... As the book weaves through > London, America, Nova Scotia and Africa, though, Schama's technique relaxes, > to be laid, most strikingly, at the service of the book's black characters. > ... At the end of this immaculately controlled, brave and important work, > only the most callous of readers could fail to shed a tear. James Walvin, in his Guardian review, stated: > Parts of the story have been well rehearsed by earlier historians, but never > like this. One of Schama's great talents is the ability to fit together > distinct episodes into a much broader and more telling narrative. He also > brings to the story his characteristic flair and historical imagination. The New York Times Brent Staples praised the book as well, describing it as \\"a stirringly ambitious reconsideration of the Revolution with the question of slavery set at the very heart of the matter\\". Adaptations In 2007, BBC Two aired the drama-documentary Rough Crossings, based on Schama's book. A reviewer stated that the \\"success of this endeavour is unfortunately limited as the programme fails to inform its audience which this history should be remembered apart from its perceived strangeness and neglect\\". \\"The programme's weakness in delivering an effective message is also let down in its use of Schama's pieces to camera and the dramatic reconstructions of the story.\\" The two halves of the production, with \\"different styles\\", \\"do not sit well together\\". It was released to DVD by BBC Home Entertainment. In 2007, Headlong Theatre produced a stage adaptation, adapted by Caryl Phillips, which toured the UK. The British Theatre Guide review stated, \\"This play attempts to take a big book with many strands and meld them into a satisfying three hour play\\", but \\"is too diffuse to make for a coherent drama\\".

It is classified as one of the active volcanoes of the country with the last confirmed eruption in 1860. The volcano is politically located in the similarly-named Barangay of Babuyan Claro, in the Municipality of Calayan, Cagayan province, in the Cagayan Valley Region (Region II) of the country. Physical features Babuyan Claro is a stratovolcano with an elevation of and a base diameter of about located in the center of Babuyan Island (also referred to as Babuyan Claro Island).Base diameter measured using Google Earth as the data at PHIVOLCS is incorrect at . It has four morphologically-fresh volcanic edifices: Mt. Cayonan in the south, Mt. Naydi and Mt. Dionisio in the southeast. Babuyan Claro has two very well-preserved craters in diameter. The Askedna Hot Spring is located at the southern basal slope of Babuyan Claro. It has a temperature range of . The water is slightly acidic and the silica content is relatively high since the spring flows directly from lava flow deposits. The spring water can be classified as near-neutral sodium chloride brine. Eruptions Babuyan Claro has two confirmed historical eruptions: in 1831 and 1860. The eruption on 1913 is listed as uncertain by the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution while the 1917 eruption is confirmed as an eruption of Smith Volcano. Eruptions on Babuyan Claro is determined as probably strombolian or phreatomagmatic by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. Recent reported activity In July 1993, there were reports of earthquakes and alleged drying up of vegetation at the upper slopes and summit area of the volcano but volcanologists said the earthquakes were of tectonic in origin and there was no significant change in the volcanic activity. In February 2004, there were reports of grayish steam clouds hovering above the summit but volcanologists from PHIVOLCS said the seismic swarm was of tectonic origin and the steaming activity was only wispy to weak.

Milliken Jr. (August 19, 1897 ‚Äì July 4, 1969) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district from 1959 to 1965. He served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for Delaware County from 1943 to 1946 and from 1949 to 1950. Early life and education Milliken was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and moved to Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania in 1906. He attended Sharon Hill public schools and graduated from Drexel Institute in Philadelphia. After graduation he worked as a construction foreman and a sales executive for the Whitehall Cement Manufacturing Company. Career He was elected to the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives for Delaware County in a special election in 1943 to serve the remainder of the 1943 term. He was reelected in 1944 and 1948. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1946 and 1950. He served as clerk of courts of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. He was appointed burgess of Sharon Hill to fill an unexpired term on September 14, 1948, and was reelected in 1949, 1953 and 1957 and served until 1959. Milliken was elected as a Republican to the Eighty-sixth, Eighty-seventh and Eighty-eighth Congresses. =The 1958 election= Milliken was a member of the Delaware County Board of Republican Supervisors, known as the \\"War Board\\", run by political boss John J. McClure. When Benjamin F. James announced his retirement from Congress in February 1958, there was speculation as to whom the War Board would endorse for his successor. Milliken was among those being considered for the job. When the War Board met on March 21, 1958, at McClure's home, it was reported that those in attendance were: Milliken, state senator G. Robert Watkins; county commissioners Arthur C. Throne and J. Warren Bullen; Walter Weaver of Darby Township; Newtown Township supervisor John Gable; state committeeman Albert H. Swing of Radnor; Fred Duke of Clifton Heights; Roy Blackburn of Haverford Township; and John R. Cramp, county Republican chairman. Milliken was endorsed by the McClure political machine by an undisclosed vote. The primary election was a four-way race for the GOP nomination, with Milliken winning a majority over his rivals. Milliken received 41,553 votes to Edmund Jones, 15,866; Ivan H. \\"Cy\\" Peterman, an Upper Darby journalist, 11,683; and Upper Darby 10th Ward commissioner Jack F. Robbins, with 11,240. The election between Milliken and Earle degenerated into a bitter race, with the latter accusing the former of having converted county funds to his own personal use. Specifically, when Milliken was Clerk of Courts, he had used $5,953 in fees paid to the county for his own use, later paying back all of the funds. James J. Connor, the minority County Commissioner, jumped into the fray, declaring that he would ask his fellow commissioners to file suit against Milliken to recover about $1,400 in estimated interest that these funds would have earned. An indignant Milliken said that his actions were not illegal and had been standard practice, at least by his two predecessors in office, and retaliated by filing a criminal libel suit against Earle. Earle was then arrested and posted a $1,000 bail on October 25, but Milliken failed to appear at the magistrate's hearing at the Springfield Township Building that day. The Democrat was undeterred by the lawsuit and continued his attacks the next day at a rally in Chester, offering to withdraw from the campaign and go to jail if Milliken would answer several pointed questions regarding the missing funds. =1959 to 1960= Milliken was sworn in as Delaware County's representative in Congress on January 3, 1959. After taking office, Milliken was appointed to the House Banking and Currency Committee and introduced several bills in 1959, including one to increase the amount of other income allowed without causing a loss of social security benefits from $1,200 to $1,800. Another bill was to allow the exemption of suburbanites from the Philadelphia wage tax. During the year, he supported President Eisenhower's attempts to hold down federal spending, including numerous vetoes, in 66% of the votes and opposed those efforts 34% of the time. Out of thirty Pennsylvania congressmen, he tied for second place among those supporting economy in government. As a result of these efforts, the budget year ending June 30, 1960, would show a small surplus of $1.2 billion and would be the last budget surplus that would not include the use of the surplus in the trust funds, such as Social Security. Other significant legislation for the year included the approval by the House, 323-89, for Hawaii's admission into the Union, which Milliken supported. During the following year, Milliken supported funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed for court appointed referees to help register minorities to vote and efforts to increase the minimum wage. For his first term, Milliken proved to be the strongest supporter of the Eisenhower administration in the Pennsylvania delegation, with an 81% score in support and only 18% in opposition. However, on July 1, he deserted his president, along with many other Republicans, in voting to override the veto of a proposed 7.5% pay raise for federal workers. =The 1960 election= In 1960, Milliken ran for a second term against Democrat Henry Gouley. On October 7, he charged that rumors that the Philadelphia Mint would be closed or moved were false. He charged that Philadelphia Mayor Richardson Dilworth circulated the story \\"to scare people in the Philadelphia area during the election campaign\\" and that an act of Congress was required to approve such plans. On October 22, Nixon visited Chester, Pennsylvania and spoke to a crowd of about 8,000 at Market Square along with Milliken. Milliken also campaigned on his own, appearing at the Marcus Hook fire company meeting hall on October 27. He attacked JFK and other Democrats who said that the nation's popularity was at an \\"all-time low\\". During Eisenhower's administration, Milliken countered: \\"The U.S. has never been beaten on a single UN vote\\" and made a point that U.S. popularity had \\"undoubtedly suffered in some areas abroad because of continuing Democrat attempts to downgrade America.\\" State Senator Bell also spoke, emphasizing American air power, naval strength, outer space vehicles and hydrogen bombs. The same day, at the Springfield Lions Club meeting at the Deville Diner, both candidates for the Seventh congressional district met. Milliken was introduced by Springfield GOP chairman, Lawrence G. Williams, while Gouley was introduced by Joseph Helwig, the township's Democratic leader. Milliken attacked \\"extravagant spending by the Democrats\\" in Congress. His opponent, Gouley, issued a rebuttal, stating that under Eisenhower, spending increased 46% in the past eight years and was 68% higher than under the Roosevelt administration, reaching a record total of $579 billion. In Delaware County, with the Democrats having a record 59,500 registered voters and Kennedy's strong appeal, Nixon carried the county by only 135,672 to 124,629. With some ticket-splitting, Milliken's plurality was slightly larger than Nixon's, 136,021 to 120,839. =The 1962 mid-term election= For the 1962 elections, Democrats had two liberal candidates from Philadelphia heading the statewide ticket in addition to a liberal Democrat in the White House. Republicans went on the attack and raised the issue of the likelihood of annexation of Delaware County by the City of Philadelphia. In April, Milliken spoke in Washington to some 300 members of the Delaware County Women's Republican Club, declaring that if Dilworth was elected \\"...we will have become a part of Philadelphia before his term as governor is up.\\" He further elaborated that if the Democrats win, it \\"will be the beginning of the end of home rule\\" for the county and the election will be a \\"fight for survival for Delaware County\\". He was joined by William Scranton, who strongly supported Milliken's reelection, emphasizing that the latter had been named to the House appropriations committee at a time when fiscal conservatism was important. James E. Van Zandt joined in, predicting a \\"voters' rebellion\\" that will spell victory for the GOP. By the fall, the campaign rhetoric heated up and became even more exaggerated. On September 24, at another Women's Republican Club function at the Alpine Inn in Springfield, Scranton's solution to crime in Philadelphia was evidently to blame Dilworth for a \\"reign of terror\\" in the city \\"that stops women and children ... from walking even one block to go to the store.\\" Adding further to the fear tactics, Congressman Van Zandt charged that Clark was \\"soft on Communism\\". Milliken added the only sensible point: \\"If this country continues spending as it is doing, it will spend itself into bankruptcy.\\" Meanwhile, the Democratic candidate for Congress, Chester attorney John A. Reilly, went on the attack, accusing Milliken of \\"double talk\\" and expecting to win due to the \\"complacency of Delaware County voters. I feel they are entitled to learn that Milliken has done nothing constructive in Washington and that he is no more than a puppet for his Chester bosses.\\" He also decried Milliken's raising of \\"phony issues such as annexation\\". On October 4, the Upper Darby GOP committee issued a statement: \\"If the voters of Upper Darby Township want to stop Philadelphia at 63rd Street, they can do so by voting a straight Republican ticket this fall.\\" Meanwhile, in response to Reilly's call for debates, Milliken said that his busy schedule made it impossible to debate. Reilly, in turn, said that the incumbent congressman was \\"full of phony excuses\\" and \\"afraid of the voters\\". Milliken won easily with 136,955 votes to Reilly's 88,482. =War Board Revolt= After the 1963 General Election in Delaware County, a struggle for power broke out among members of the Republican ruling circles. Milliken had aligned himself with Sam Dickey from Upper Darby against McClure in an attempt to take over the War Board. McClure had attempted to appoint Upper Darby Township Commissioner George Hill, a former Dickey rival, to the War Board, rather than a representative chosen by Dickey. The Upper Darby Board of Commissioners, in their other capacity as GOP ward leaders, voted to nominate Dickey himself to the War Board. By early 1964, the War Board split had attracted four other Republican candidates for Milliken's seat: Harold Ervin of Media; John G. Pew, replacing Swing on the War Board; attorney Stephen McEwen of Upper Darby; and former county commissioner Watkins. Matters came to a head on February 7, when the War Board endorsed Watkins over Milliken, citing the latter's poor health as the reason for rejection. Milliken received only one vote, presumably his own, in the War Board polling. Later than month, the Collingdale Republican leaders followed the lead of Glenolden, Darby, Prospect Park and Tinicum, in dumping Milliken as its representative on the War Board. There was some measure of suspense as Milliken pondered another race, this time as an independent, but on February 18, he issued a terse statement: \\"After consideration, I have decided not to be a candidate for reelection to the U.S. Congress.\\" Milliken served out the last year of his term, until January 3, 1965, but would surface again as a candidate in 1966, unsuccessfully bucking his party's leadership. He died in Ridley Park on July 4, 1969 and is interred at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania.

Its role is to advance the science and practice of radiology and oncology, further public education and set appropriate professional standards of practice. The College also sets and monitors the educational curriculum for those training to enter the profession. It is a registered charity in the United Kingdom (no. 211540). The College publishes two journals, Clinical Oncology and the Clinical Radiology Journal, as well as awarding various prizes and scholarships. History A series of bodies has represented practitioners of radiological medicine in the UK, starting in 1897 with the foundation of the Roentgen Society (named for the physicist Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen). Subsequently-founded societies included the British Association of Radiologists (1934), the Society of Radiotherapists of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1935) and the Faculty of Radiologists (1939). In 1950 the first issue of the Clinical Radiology Journal was published by the Faculty of Radiologists, who were then granted a Royal Charter of incorporation in 1953. Professor Sir Brian Windeyer helped found and became President of the Faculty of Radiologists from 1949-52.Windeyer - history of a building, accessed 23 March 2013 A supplemental charter was given in 1975 to rename the Faculty as The Royal College of Radiologists. The College then published the first issue of Clinical Oncology in September 1989.  Fellowship of Royal College of Radiologist Examinations  Candidates are examined against the Specialty Training Curriculum for Clinical Radiology. The specialty trainees are expected to complete their First FRCR examination before progressing to ST2. During their ST3 training year they are expected to pass the Final FRCR Part A examination, and must complete this before progressing to ST4. During ST4, trainees are expected to pass the Final FRCR Part B examination. = First FRCR examination = The fellowship examinations start at the beginning of the Specialty Training Year 1 (ST1). The First FRCR examination expects candidates to have gained a knowledge of the physical principles that underpin diagnostic medical imaging and of the anatomy needed to perform and interpret radiological studies. The First FRCR examination comprises two modules: Physics and Anatomy. The anatomy modules is a 90-minute exam comprising 100 images, where each image has several annotations, each of which in turn has a single related question. The physics module is a 120-minute multiple choice question paper comprising 40 questions, each with five true or false answers. = Final FRCR Part A examination = The Final FRCR Part A examination comprises single best answers, split into two separate papers for the purposes of delivery. Each paper contains 120 questions and examining candidates on all aspects of clinical radiology and the basic sciences of physics, anatomy and techniques. The main areas examined are: 1\\\\. Cardiothoracic and Vascular 2\\\\. Musculoskeletal and Trauma 3\\\\. Gastro- intestinal 4\\\\. Genito-urinary, Adrenal, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Breast 5\\\\. Paediatric 6\\\\. Central Nervous and Head & Neck = Final FRCR Part B examination = During the ST4 training, the specialty trainees are expected to complete the Final FRCR Part B. The Final FRCR (Part B) examination consists of a reporting session, a rapid reporting session and an oral examination. The extensive examination provided by the RCR ensures a high quality and standard of radiology consultants. It has been deemed as one of the hardest examinations in the medical profession, along with the FRCA and FRCPath. List of Fellows * Moya Cole * Dr. K.A.

That evening, Sigrid hosted a lavish feast at which Harald and his companions became drunk. Under cover of darkness, she ordered her armed men to set fire to the hall in which Harald slept, and he was killed; those of his companions who escaped the flames were put to the sword.

These islands include Long Beach Barrier Island, Barnum Island, Jones Beach Island, Fire Island and Westhampton Island. The outer barrier extends along the South Shore of Long Island, from the Rockaway Peninsula in New York City to the east end of Shinnecock Bay in Suffolk County. The lagoons enclosed by the barrier islands are Jamaica Bay, Brosewere Bay, Hewlett Bay, Reynolds Channel, Middle Bay, East Bay, South Oyster Bay, Great South Bay, and arms of the Great South Bay that have their own geographic names: Great Cove, Nicoll Bay, Patchogue Bay, Bellport Bay, Narrow Bay, Moriches Bay, Quantuck Bay, Tiana Bay, and Shinnecock Bay. East Rockaway Inlet, Jones Inlet, Fire Island Inlet, Old Inlet, Moriches Inlet, and Shinnecock Inlet pierce the barrier, forming the individual sandy islands. The resort communities of Atlantic Beach, Long Beach, and Westhampton Beach; the Fire Island National Seashore, Robert Moses State Park, Jones Beach State Park, and other recreational areas are found there. The low-lying islands are subject to wave erosion, and, during storms, they are sometimes inundated and cut through. The islands frameless =New York City islands= Coney Island, Pelican Beach, Plumb Beach, Barren Island, several smaller islands in Jamaica Bay, and parts of what is now the Rockaway peninsula formerly comprised the westernmost Outer Barrier islands. Of these, Coney Island was the westernmost island. Most of these islands were either connected to mainland Long Island or combined with each other in the early 20th century. =Long Beach Barrier Island= Long Beach Barrier Island lies off the south shore of Long Island. The island is shared by the hamlet of Atlantic Beach to the west, the city of Long Beach and the hamlet of Lido Beach in the central part of the island, and the hamlet of Point Lookout at the eastern end of the island. (The three hamlets ‚Äî Atlantic Beach, Lido Beach, and Point Lookout ‚Äî are part of the town of Hempstead, New York.) Within its section of the barrier island, the city of Long Beach spans the entire north-south width of the island, fronting on both Reynolds Channel, to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean, to the south. A drawbridge, the Long Beach Bridge, connects it to Island Park, a small island which lies between Long Beach and the mainland of Long Island. To the west, the Atlantic Beach Bridge, connects the island to Lawrence on Long Island. The Loop Parkway, located to the east where Lido Beach and Point Lookout border one another, connects the island to Jones Beach.center =Jones Beach Island= Jones Beach Island Jones Beach Island is a barrier island off the southern coast of Long Island in the U.S. state of New York. It is named for the father of historian Thomas Jones. It is sometimes referred to as Oak Beach Island, and the former home of the infamous Oak Beach Inn. It is separated from Long Island by Great South Bay. The island straddles the county line between Nassau and Suffolk counties and includes the census-designated places of Gilgo and Oak Beach‚ÄìCaptree, New York. The southern side of the island is known for its beaches that face the open Atlantic Ocean.

Its eastern end is linked to Babylon, New York as well as to Fire Island, New York by the Robert Moses Causeway via the Great South Bay Bridge and the State Boat Channel Bridge. The Ocean Parkway connects all three causeways and runs the length of the island, while The Fire Island Inlet Bridge continues on the Robert Moses Causeway finding its way to the New York's Fire Island on the Atlantic Ocean. =Fire Island= Fire Island is a barrier island, approximately 31 miles (50 km) long and varying between approximately 0.1 mile (160 m) to 0.25 mile (400 m) wide. Fire Island passes through southern Suffolk County, New York, and is southeast of Long Island separated from the main land by the Great South Bay in the U.S. state of New York, running approximately SW to NE. The land area is 8.687 sq. mi. (22.5 km2), and a permanent population of 491 people was reported as of the 2000 census. (There are hundreds of thousands of summertime residents, groupers and daytrippers.) The island is composed of three communities, as defined by the Census Bureau. The largest of these is Fire Island (CDP), which is unincorporated and stretches through the southern portion of the towns of Babylon, Islip, and Brookhaven. There are several ocean front communities such as, Davis Park and Watch Hill that are on the eastern side of the Great south bay. Fire Island has a variety of ocean front communities that can be reached by private boat, or seasonal ferry service from Long Island's mainland. Fire Island has a 2000 census population of 310 inhabitants. There are also two villages in the Islip section of the island, Saltaire (pop. 43) and Ocean Beach (pop. 138). In addition, a part of Fire Island CDP is not even on the island, but on a separate island adjacent to West Hampton Dunes. Fire Island Inlet is an inlet on the south shore of Long Island, New York. It connects the Great South Bay with the Atlantic Ocean, passing between Robert Moses State Park (the western end of Fire Island) on the south and Oak Beach and Captree State Park (the eastern end of Jones Island) on the north. The stated land area and population figures result when this section is subtracted out. The inlet is directly south of West Islip, the nearest town on the main part of Long Island.The Lighthouse at the Fire Island National Seashore The inlet has evolved over the years due to natural processes, especially longshore drift. Jones Island and Fire Island at one time were connected. The Fire Island Light was at the mouth of the inlet when built in 1858, but is now six miles east of the inlet. =Westhampton Island= Westhampton Islandhttp://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:2634469 is the easternmost outer barrier island in the Town of Southampton.

Cupsogue Beach County Park is located on the western end of the island. NASA satellite map of Moriches inlet Moriches Inlet is an inlet connecting Moriches Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The inlet created a geographic oddity whereby the Town of Brookhaven actually has jurisdiction on land immediately west of the village of West Hampton Dunes although Brookhaven land access to it involves a nearly 20 mile drive through Southampton. Shinnecock Inlet is the easternmost of five major inlets http://www.nd.edu/~adcirc/shinnecock.htm connecting bays to the Atlantic Ocean through the narrow 100-mile-long barrier islands that stretch from New York City to Southampton, New York on the south shore of Long Island. The inlet was formed by the Great Hurricane of 1938 which killed several people when it permanently broke through the island in Hampton Bays, New York. The inlet is almost directly lined up with the Shinnecock Canal between Shinnecock Bay and the Peconic Bay and saves miles for boaters going to the open Atlantic. Consequently, management has been geared to keep the inlet dredged and open. However, maintenance of the inlet has been controversial on grounds that it causes beach erosion on Fire Island.

Once unfolded from its storage tube and its electronics initialized, the SkySeer is then hand- launched by its operator. All of the drone's basic flight functions are handled by GPS including landings. Range is approximately two miles/3.2 km and is extendable via Octatron's NetWeaver interface. The basic platform is very low cost; a fully loaded SkySeer retails for approximately US$25,000 to $30,000 which includes all electronics, video surveillance equipment, ground station and computer interfaces. Video interface is in real time and allows the operator to literally see what the drone sees and to record it as such. The ground station's recorder can store up to twenty hours of high-quality MPEG-2 format video which can then be transferred to DVD or Macromedia Flash. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is currently experimenting with the SkySeer as a means of crime prevention. At present, the experiment has been suspended by the Federal Aviation Administration because of that agency's claim of a lack of the proper permits.

Biography =Early life= Young was born at Londesborough, Yorkshire, the second son of a family of 12. His father, Colonel Young, came of prosperous yeoman stock. Blamire Young was educated at the Forest School, Walthamstow, where he received a classical training, and going on to Cambridge University specialised in mathematics. That he completed his course with no better than third-class honours was no doubt partly caused by his discovery of the print collection in the Fitzwilliam Museum, and his association with the Cambridge Fine Art Society. It had been intended that he should become a clergyman, but Young felt that he had no vocation for that work and obtained the position of mathematical master at Katoomba College, Katoomba, New South Wales, which had been founded by John Walter Fletcher in 1884. Young remained at the school for eight years. In his spare time he practised painting, and meeting Phil May received some instruction from him in painting in oil. The musician (1901) =Artistic work= In 1893, he returned to England and after working for a few months under Hubert von Herkomer, became associated with James Pryde and William Nicholson in poster work. In 1895 Young returned to Australia and with the Lindsay brothers and Harry Weston did some excellent posters. But the field was limited and many years of poverty followed, during which a certain amount of writing was done for the press. He began exhibiting at the Victorian Artists' Society, but sales were few and the one-man show was then unknown. During his visit to England he had married Mabel Sawyer, an expert wood-carver, and while the lean period lasted Mrs Young helped to keep the house going by executing commissions for Melbourne architects. It was not until 1911 that the appreciation of Young's art really began to be shown. In that year he held an exhibition at Melbourne of small pictures, some of which had similar qualities to the Japanese coloured wood-cuts of the eighteenth century. Sales were good, partly because the prices were low, and the artist was sufficiently encouraged to hold an exhibition at Adelaide. This was both an artistic and a financial success, other shows followed in Melbourne and Sydney, and at last, in his fiftieth year, Young's reputation as an artist was established. Kangaroo and Map stamp design by Blamire Young In 1911 he was commissioned by the Postmaster-General of Australia, C E Frazer, to produce new designs for the first Commonwealth of Australia stamps. He submitted the designs in January 1912. Three types of printed essays for the Kangaroo and Map stamps are known. This design was first issued on 2 January 1913 and continued to be in use till 1935 concurrently with other stamps. The design was also used on postal stationery envelopes, letter cards, registration envelopes and newspaper wrappers.The Australian Commonwealth Specialist's Catalogue, Kangaroos, 1999 =Later years= In 1912 he sailed for Europe and after a stay in Spain settled in England. Eighteen months later in August 1914 his first show, opened at the Bailey Galleries. All the arrangements had been made and the pictures hung when war broke out. Young had been a good marksman in his youth, and for three years worked as an instructor in musketry and machine-gunnery. Immediately after the war he took up his painting again and exhibited at the Academy and the Royal Society of British Artists. Back in Australia in 1923 Young established himself at Montrose in the hills about 20 miles east of Melbourne. He acted as art critic for The Herald and held occasional one-man shows. His position was now secure, and he was recognised everywhere as one of the leading artists in water-colour in Australia. He died at Montrose and was survived by his wife and two daughters. In addition to his newspaper writings he published a one-act play The Children's Bread in 1912, and in 1923 The Proverbs of Goya, an interesting attempt to disclose the inner meaning of Goya's series of etchings known as Los disparates. Another one-act play, Art for Arts Sake, was produced at the Melbourne Repertory Theatre in 1911. Legacy In 1976 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post for his work as designer of the first Australian postage stamp.

The Festival Centre was erected on the site of the Adelaide City Baths, which had been there for over a century. History and construction =Background= In the 1960s, the Adelaide Festival of the Arts started to outgrow the city's existing venues, and there was a push to build a \\"Festival Hall\\". The Adelaide Festival Theatre Act 1964 provided for the erection of the Festival Theatre building. The originally proposed site was the Carclew building in North Adelaide, which had been purchased from the Bonython family by the Adelaide City Council for the purposes of building a Festival Hall.Morgan, Felicity. , Flinders University, Interview with Marjorie Fitzgerald OAM. Liberal state Premier Steele Hall lobbied the Federal Government for tax concessions for a public appeal for the Festival Hall, which was initially unsuccessful, until Prime Minister John Gorton offered Hall either tax concessions or . Hall accepted the money.Campbell, Lance. By Popular Demand: The Adelaide Festival Centre Story, pg 18. While on a trip to London, Steele Hall visited the Royal Festival Hall on the banks of the River Thames and decided that the banks of the River Torrens was the ideal choice for the site of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts and the cultural heart of the city. During this time, the state government changed hands, but the drive for a new centre continued with fervour. When Don Dunstan became Premier he expanded the idea into a \\"Festival Centre\\", incorporating multiple smaller venues.Llewellyn-Smith, Michael. Behind the Scenes: The Politics of Planning Adelaide, University of Adelaide Press The Lord Mayor of Adelaide, Robert Porter, supported by Dunstan, launched a public appeal to raise funds to build the Festival Centre and establish Adelaide as a significant city in the art world. The appeal raised its target within a week, and was soon over-subscribed; the surplus was set aside to create a collection of artworks to grace the new building. The Adelaide City Baths, which had stood on the site since their creation in 1861 and upgraded several times since, including the addition of an Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1940, were demolished in 1969 to make way for the new centre. center800pxthumb360-degree panoramic view of the Southern Plaza of the Festival Theatre Centre in 2007 (foreground demolished since photo).

It was designed from the inside out by architect John Morphett. The main building, the Festival Theatre, was completed in 1973, within its budget of $10 million. On 2 June 1973 the Festival Theatre was officially opened by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam at a gala performance of Act Two, Scene 1 of Beethoven's opera Fidelio and Choral Symphony. The construction of the Playhouse (now Dunstan Playhouse), Space Theatre and Amphitheatre followed. Outdoor sculptures graced the outdoor spaces, including the prominent stainless steel Environmental Sculpture (also known as Tetrahedra), by Bert Flugelman. South of complex, the Festival Plaza was completed in March 1977, comprising a then-controversial environmental sculpture by West German artist Otto Hajek. The sculpture was conceived as a concrete garden and iconic City Sign. The lego-like forms and colourful paint work across the plaza were designed to conceal an air-conditioning vent at the same time as provide a playful place to congregate. However, Adelaide's citizens never warmed to the idea, the sculpture suffered poor maintenance, and it remained one of Adelaide's most under-utilised public spacesFestival Centre Plaza until its demolition in 2018. The whole Centre was completed for . (By comparison, the Sydney Opera House, completed in 1973, cost .)Sydney Opera House =21st century redevelopment= In 2003, the area around Adelaide Festival Centre was redeveloped substantially. The much-maligned Festival Plaza was redesigned, including opening the underground plaza to the sky and building a pedestrian suspension bridge to link the Plaza to the nearby Riverbank Precinct and a few caf√©s, restaurants and retail outlets. From 2016 the Festival Plaza has been undergoing a redevelopment, as part of the major redevelopment of the Riverbank Precinct, expected to be complete in 2022. A short branch from the Glenelg tram line to the Festival Centre was opened in October 2018. Governance In 1971 the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust was established as a statutory authority by the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust Act 1971, reporting to the Minister for the Arts. From about 1996 until late 2018, Arts SA (later Arts South Australia) had responsibility for this and several other statutory bodies such as the South Australian Museum and the Art Gallery of South Australia. Arts SA leased Her Majesty's Theatre and the Festival Centre to the Trust, which was responsible for \\"encouraging and facilitating artistic, cultural and performing arts activities throughout the State\\" and managing and maintaining the theatres. In July 2017, the Trust bought Her Majesty's Theatre from Arts South Australia for . It also borrowed from the South Australian Government Financing Authority for a maximum term of 10 years to fund Her Majesty‚Äôs Theatre redevelopment. From late 2018, the functions previously held by Arts SA were transferred to direct oversight by the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, Arts and Culture section. Venues Adelaide Festival Centre houses the several theatres and galleries, as well as function spaces and the administrative hub of the Festival Centre. * Festival Theatre is the largest proscenium arch theatre in Adelaide, seating close to 2000 people. It was designed as both a lyric theatre and concert hall, and is used not only for theatrical productions and large concerts, but also for graduation ceremonies, seminars and many other community functions. Its huge backstage area makes the stage area one of the largest in the southern hemisphere. It also houses the Silver Jubilee Organ, a \\"hovering\\" pipe organ built and donated to mark the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. * Dunstan Playhouse, located in the Drama Centre behind the main building, is a more intimate venue, seating 620 people on two levels. The State Theatre Company has been based here since 1974, and uses the theatre, the rehearsal rooms and the extensive production workshop also housed in this second building. * Space Theatre is a versatile studio theatre, sharing the Drama Centre building with the Dunstan. It has no traditional stage or fixed seating, meaning its configuration is completely flexible. It can be turned into a theatre in the round, a corner stage setting, or a cabaret venue. The Space seats anywhere from 200 to 350 people, depending on the configuration. * Her Majesty's Theatre is a newly redeveloped 1500-seat theatre located on Grote Street. First opened in 1913, the theatre underwent extensive rebuilding from 2018 to 2020 to become a world-class venue. * Artspace Gallery is a gallery exhibition space situated in the second building above the Dunstan Playhouse. * The Terrace (formerly called the Amphitheatre) is an outdoor space overlooking Elder Park and the River Torrens. *Artspace Gallery and QBE Galleries are further exhibition spaces.

After its publication by W. Knott & Son Limited in 1912, The English Missal was rapidly endorsed by the growing Ritualist movement of Anglo-Catholic clergy, who viewed the liturgies of the Book of Common Prayer as insufficient expressions of fully Catholic worship. The translation of the Roman Missal from Latin into the stylized Elizabethan Early Modern English of the Book of Common Prayer allowed clergy to preserve the use of the vernacular language while adopting the Roman Catholic texts and liturgical rubrics. The only difference in content from the Roman Missal of the time is The English Missal inclusion of certain texts from the Book of Common Prayer, including optional prayers from the ordinary of the Prayer Book's Communion Service and the lessons for Sundays and major feast days from the Prayer Book's lectionary, which was itself taken from the earlier Sarum Use Mass of pre-Reformation England. After the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 threatened imprisonment for priests using ritualist liturgical practices, a custom arose of the celebrant saying the Roman Canon in Latin to himself silently (i.e., sotto voce, in a soft voice) in addition to saying the official texts of the Book of Common Prayer aloud. While enforcement of the Public Worship Regulation Act ended in 1906, the custom persisted, due in part to the fact that in the pre-Vatican II Roman Rite the Canon of the Mass was always said silently. For this reason, the Latin text of the Canon of the Mass was included in The English Missal in addition to the English translation. The English Missal went through five editions. The first four were based on the Roman Missal of Pius V as revised until the time of Pope Pius X. The last edition includes the revised Roman Catholic Holy Week of 1958. One American edition includes material that conforms to the American 1928 Book of Common Prayer. In the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council and the subsequent authorization of new typical editions of the Roman Missal with official translations in English, the use of The English Missal has greatly declined. Especially in England, the English version of the Roman Missal is widely used in Anglo-Catholic parishes. However, the use of The English Missal continues in a small number of liturgically traditional Anglican parish churches in England, the United States, and West Africa.

It is one of the historical main towns of the Eastern Veneto territory, although it was totally reconstructed in the early 1920s after being heavily damaged during the World War I. Geography San Don√† lies on the river Piave from Venice, from Treviso, and from Pordenone. San Don√† and the surrounding cities in Veneto are known for being foggy in the autumn and the winter months. It bounds the communes of Noventa di Piave, Musile di Piave and Fossalta di Piave, that have become in practice a part of a single urban area, also known as Citt√† del Piave. Besides, San Don√† borders on the territories of Jesolo, Eraclea, Ceggia, Torre di Mosto, Cessalto and Salgareda. History The area was inhabited since the prehistoric age: the archeological researches that have taken place during the 20th century have revealed traces of a Neolithic village in the neighbourhood of Chiesanuova, on the left bank of the river Piave Moreover, significant traces of centuriation and the presence of an articulate road network make suppose that the zone was inhabited also during the Roman age. During the Dark Ages the fate of the area was band to the city of Heraclia, episcopal location and first capital of the Duchy of Venice. The city, grown in the 7th century in the area of the suburb of Cittanova, disappeared in the 9th century. After the year 1000, in the modern town's territory, two villages were built: San Donato and Mussetta. They were at first subject to the temporal jurisdiction (papacy) of the patriarchy of Aquileia and then they were affected by the events of the Ezzelini family. The village of Mussetta was situated in the north, close to a castle built by the patriarchs of Aquileia, while the village of San Donato was situated in the south, surrounding a chapel which was present since 1154. In 1250 the area experienced a catastrophic flood from the river Piave, which changed its course, moving the chapel from the left bank to the right one. This deviation implied the separation of the church from its reference area, that started to be called \\"San Donato de qua de la Piave\\" to be distinct from the area closest to the chapel: \\"San Donato oltre la Piave\\" (the current Musile di Piave). During the 13th and 14th centuries the area was in a strategic position between the Marca Trevigiana and the Republic of Venice and for these reasons was exposed to plunders and destructions, ended with the occupation of the area by the troops of Sigismund of Luxemburg and the destruction of Mussetta. At the end of the war between the Republic of Venice and the United Kingdom, the Republic incentivized the development of the territory, offering tax exemptions to the farmers that were inclined to move in the territory of San Don√†. As a matter of fact, Venice was straight interested in this area since most of the town's surface was state-owned property. During the Modern era, the Republic of Venice started some reclamation interventions in the area of Basso Piave and assigned the management of the territory to a functionary. In 1468 compelling financial needs induced the Republic to give the Gastaldia of the town in emphyteusis. In 1475 it was assigned to Francesco Marcello and Angelo Trevisan, and it later became private property of the Trevisan family. The public authority was held by a functionary nominated by the Doge, the Ducal Vicarial, who had the duty to pledge the oath of allegiance to the Republic and to reside in San Don√†. The first Vicarial, Antonio Lupo, was installed in 1476 by the Doge Pietro Mocenigo. During the same year, the construction of a new church started, it was dedicated to Blessed Virgin Mary and consecrated in July 1480. The growth and the development of the urban center was difficult at the beginning, especially because of the instable hydro balance. In order to preserve the lagoon from the periodical floods caused by the river, during the 16th and 17th centuries the Republic of Venice promoted some hydraulic works, deviating the courses of the rivers that were present. In 1797 was established the municipality of San Don√†, administrative center of one of the fifteen cantons of the Treviso's district. With the annexation of Venice and its dependency to the Napoleonic Italian Kingdom, on May 1, 1806 the Department of Adriatic was created and the town of San Don√† was part of it as administrative center of the territory of the same name. At the beginning of the 19th century, were created the first consortiums for the reclamation of the swampland at east and south of the urban center, while the city was significantly increasing its administrative functions. The city of San Don√† was part of the Lombard-Venetian Kingdom from 1815 and during the Austrian domination it kept its position of county seat of the district. In the first part of the 19th century the urban center was enriched with palaces, commercial buildings and a new cathedral, realized from 1838 and 1841. With the annexation of Veneto to the Kingdom of Italy, new hydraulic works was made in the area, scarring the environmental metamorphosis and increasing the productivity of the area. Railway and steamboat connections were created, the road network was expanded and new industries and services for the population were started. The impact of the First World War on the city was devastating. After the barging of the Italian lines in Caporetto, the Italian army gave ground and reorganized itself on the new frontline along the river Piave. On 13 November 1917 began the long months of trench warfare, culminated in the Battle of Solstizio. In the autumn of 1918 the Italian army took the resolution offensive against the Austrian emplacement and on 31 October 1918 the city of San Don√† came back to the Italian territory. At the end of the long months of combats the city infrastructures were completely destroyed and most of the architectural and artistic patrimony was lost. The first postwar period was characterized by the complete reconstruction of the city and by the renovation of the socio-economic activities, of the traffic between the city and the other districts and of the railway service. In 1940 Italy went to war alongside of Germany. After 8 September 1943 hundreds of citizens were engaged in the Italian resistance movement. In 1944 the city was exposed to several bombardments: during the aerial raid both the Verdi Theater and the Umberto I Hospital were destroyed. On 25 April 1945, in the presence of six thousands German soldiers, was proclaimed the insurrection of the city, and in the same day, the town of San Don√† was free. San Don√† is now a crucial point of the transport infrastructures between Vento and Friuli Venezia-Giulia, crossroad between the industrial development zone in the area of Treviso and the tourist attractions of Cavallino-Treporti, Jesolo, Eraclea and Caorle. Culture =The friendship pact= Seven centuries ago, during the Middle Ages, San Don√† and the close village of Musile di Piave were two small communities of the wetland situated north-east of Venetian Lagoon. The \\"friendship pact\\" between the two communities combines historical fact and legend. In 1258 (according to the historian Plateo) or in 1383 (according to other scholar) the Piave River changed its course naturally. At that time the river marked the boundary between two dioceses: the Patriarch of Aquileia on the eastern side and the diocese of Torcello (Venice) on the other one. The church of San Donato (Saint Donatus), which was previously on the eastern side of the river Piave, and therefore on the side of San Don√†, after the flood was on the western side of the river in the current territory of Musile di Piave. Thus the village of San Don√† (whose name is the truncated form of San Donato) lost its identity symbol. Hence the compromise: San Don√† kept the name of the saint, but its population must reward that one of Musile with two capons (\\"gallos eviratos duos\\") on August 7 of each year. Moreover, the community of Musile retained the right to make the traditional feast in honor of the parish patron saint. This is the synthesis of \\"friendship pact\\": every year on August 7, the payment of tribute is repeated. The tradition has been restored in a rich ceremony with a great attention to the historical details under the patronage of the Veneto Region.

Luce held many clerical appointments, including Vice- Provost of Trinity from 1946 to 1952. He was widely known as an authority on the philosopher George Berkeley. His fellowship of Trinity College from 1912 to 1977 is a record. Life =Schooling= Luce was born in Gloucester on 21 August 1882. He was the fourth son of the Reverend John James Luce and Alice Luce (n√©e Stubbs). He was educated at Lindley Lodge School and Eastbourne College. He entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1901. He obtained his BA in 1905, BD in 1908 and MA in 1911. =Early academic work= Luce's earlier work focuses largely on theological matters within Christianity. His academic career was interrupted by World War I, in which he served with the 12th Royal Irish Rifles. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1917. After the war, he published \\"Monophysitism Past and Present\\" (1921) which deals with the nature of Jesus and his relationship to the world. The following year, he published his Donnellan Lectures on Henri Bergson where he examined issues in psychology and evolution as well as religion. =Work on Berkeley= From the 1930s, Luce became interested in the Irish philosopher George Berkeley. Luce felt many of the previous studies of Berkeley were in many ways inadequate and sometimes wrong. His unearthing of new sources on Berkeley as well as better ways of interpreting existing sources guided Luce's work in this direction. Luce stressed the role of the French monk Malebranche on influencing the thought of the young Berkeley. Prior to Luce's Berkeley and Malebranche (1934) Berkeley had been seen almost solely in the patrimony of John Locke and empiricism. Berkeley's mature philosophy was given lucid exposition by Luce in his 1945 work \\"Berkeley's Immaterialism\\". Along with Thomas Edmund JessopSee: Bettcher, Talia Mae (PhD, California State University) JESSOP, Thomas Edmund - In: Dictionary of Twentieth Century British Philosophers. Ed by S. Brown. Thoemmes Continuum, 2005. Pp. 474-475. he edited The Works of George Berkeley (in nine volumes, 1948‚Äì1957). Luce was not only a Berkeley scholar but came to be a believer in Berkelianism itself. In \\"Sense without Matter\\" (1954) Luce attempts to bring Berkeley up to date by modernising the philosophers vocabulary and putting the issues Berkeley faced in today's terms. In this work, Luce also treats of the Biblical account of matter (or rather the lack of such an account) and the psychology of perception and nature. Berkeley's personal reputation among historians and the public was also an area which Luce felt needed correcting and updating. Some studies of Berkeley had contributed to his reputation as a dreamer or a loner who often hid his real views. Luce's \\"Life of George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne\\" (1949) takes aim at this picture of Berkeley and by careful use of (often new) sources paints a more grounded picture of the man. Personal life In 1918, Luce married Lilian Mary Thomson, with whom he had three children. Tragically, his wife and young daughter drowned in 1940. His elder son Professor John Victor Luce (1920‚Äì2011) was also an academic at Trinity and also served as vice-provost. His original academic work and numerous administrative and clerical appointments earned him a solid local and international reputation. He was regarded as a fine preacher and respected tutor. His hobbies were chess and particularly angling on which he wrote a book (\\"Fishing and Thinking\\" 1959) which is regarded highly among anglers: to his freshmen philosophy students, he would muse, \\"fishing and philosophy: trout and truth!\\" He died, shortly after an assault, on 28 June 1977.

Stopped-flow is a lab technique for studying fast chemical reactions. A stopped-flow instrument is a rapid mixing device used to study the chemical kinetics of fast reactions in solution. The solutions are first forced from syringes into a mixing chamber. After perhaps a few milliseconds the observation cell is filled by a piston linked to a sensing switch that triggers the measuring device and the flow is stopped suddenly. The system is often modeled by conventional kinetic equations. After two or more solutions containing the reagents are mixed, they are studied by whatever experimental methods are deemed suitable. Different forms of spectroscopy and scattering of radiation are common methods used. The dead time is the time between the end of mixing the two solutions and the beginning of observation of the kinetics of the reaction. The usual dead time of a stopped flow apparatus is 1‚Äì2 milliseconds but some new devices have been developed that have dead times of 0.3‚Äì0.6 ms.

He was awarded the Glynd≈µr Award in 2000. Born into the Welsh community in Liverpool, England, into a family originally from Anglesey, Bowen learned to play the Celtic Harp while at school, inspired by the Breton harper, Alan Stivell. In 1979 he received a degree in Welsh Language and Literature from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. He was first exposed to the more complicated Welsh Triple Harp by two members of the Welsh traditional music group Ar Log, brothers Dafydd and Gwyndaf Roberts. They had learned to play the instrument from Nansi Richards, one of the last traditional Welsh folk harpists from the previous generation. Although he regularly performs as a soloist, Bowen joined the Welsh traditional group Mabsant in 1986 and later joined Cusan T√¢n. Since 1998 he has been a member of the Welsh 'super-group' Crasdant. In 2004 he and four other Triple Harpists formed Rhes Ganol, the first Welsh Triple Harp 'Choir' to exist since that of Llanover Hall during its heyday at the beginning of the twentieth century.

ILRF works to develop prac History After Kailash Satyarthi and Bread for the World founded Rugmark in 1994, ILRF helped the nascent foundation open a U.S.-based office in Washington D.C. in 1995. The two groups continued to share offices afterward. In 2007, the litigation department of ILRF, noted for its use of the Alien Tort Claims Act in litigation against those who violate labor rights, was spun off into a separate organization, International Rights Advocates (\\"IRAdvocates\\"). Although it retains legal staff, the ILRF focuses primarily on research, lobbying, boycott campaigns and various other advocacy roles. =Rana Plaza collapse= After the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory on April 24, 2013, the ILRF appeared in the media to provide an analysis on the overall situation and respond to the actions of associated companies in the wake of the incident. The collapse resulted in the death of 1,129 garment workers, highlighting working conditions that were described as those of a \\"sweatshop\\" and remuneration that was considered \\"subsistence,\\" while garments of high-end fashion labels and the U.S. government were found in the rubble. Liana Foxvog, ILRF's director of organizing and communications at the time, commented in regard to the U.S. government garments that were found: > ... the fact that Marines logo clothing was found in the rubble of the > sweatshop fire should serve as a wake-up call to the U.S. Government to put > into place safeguards to ensure decent working conditions in government > supply chains and among licensees. In June 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama announced the suspension of trade privileges with the Bangladeshi government until significant labor issues were resolved. By July 2013, the \\"Bangladesh Worker Safety Initiative\\" proposal was released by the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which was formed by a group of North American companies involved with the Bangladeshi manufacturing sector, including Walmart, Target, J.C. Penney and Gap. The key amendments of the proposal were the establishment of a hotline for workers to report concerns, the completion of inspections and the funding of safety upgrades to the garment facilities. The companies behind the Worker Safety Initiative had raised US$42 million worth of grants to improve factory infrastructure, and $100 million in low-rate loans and access to capital. The ILRF was critical of the Worker Safety Initiative and Foxvog explained to the media that: the proposal was not legally binding; the hotline was ineffective because complaints would be received by the company without the involvement of an independent party; and the corresponding funds were insufficient. The ILRF, as well as other experts in the area, had calculated that it would cost around US$300,000 to $500,000 for each factory to be upgraded, meaning that a total of at least $1 billion was required to fulfill the aim of the Worker Safety Initiative. Furthermore, the ILRF, which was supported by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL‚ÄìCIO) U.S. trade union federation, stated that workers would still require their wages while the renovations were being undertaken to survive. The ILRF dismissed claims by the National Retail Federation, which feared the instatement of an increased legal liability upon the clothing companies, and supported the \\"Accord on Fire and Building Safety\\" that had been signed by European companies and some U.S. brands by July 2013. The Accord was legally binding and provided workers with the ability to seek arbitration for their grievances, which could result in a fine for the company if a breach was detected‚ÄîFoxvog stated that the Accord allowed for a neutral arbiter and was not related to a class action. The ILRF then published a December 2013 article, in which it orderdered for the U.S. federal government to enforce labor standards for overseas procurement, including the option to sanction contractor firms that \\"do not comply with applicable laws and regulations and internationally accepted labor standards.\\" The importance of independent monitoring and the engagement of workers and unions were also emphasized by the ILRF. Bj√∂rn Skorpen Claeson, an ILRF senior policy analyst at the time, said to the Huffington Post publication: > The government should expect to pay for products made in decent working > conditions, in compliance with all applicable labor standards, by workers > who earn a living wage‚Äîthat is, a fair price. ... In the context of > procurement, paying a fair price is the way the government \\"invests\\" in > compliance. The Dangerous Silence: Exchanges Turn Blind Eye to Suppliers report was published by the ILRF on February 12, 2014, highlighting the role of U.S. military exchanges in the Bangladeshi garment industry. The report, of which Claeson is the principal author, states that some of the military exchanges \\"remain ignorant of flagrant violations in their supplier factories, because the industry audit reports failed to disclose them.\\" The director of the ILRF at the time, Judy Gearhart, said that \\"it's not acceptable for U.S. government-owned companies to be not holding up the highest bar\\" and that the issue presents a \\"huge risk\\" to the reputation of the U.S.  Activities  ILRF, working in coalition with other human rights and sweatshop-oriented NGOs, uses a diverse range of mechanisms to promote its vision of labor rights. According to its website, the ILRF has worked directly to promote labor rights through: * Research and publication * Public campaigning and media outreach * Promoting new International Labour Organization Conventions and their ratification * Promoting reform of US legislation * Advising multinational corporations on issues of corporate social responsibility * Using litigation, especially the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA), to hold corporations accountable * Using trade-related complaints processes to hold governments accountable  Campaigns  = Fairness in Flowers = ILRF's Fairness in Flowers Campaign was launched in 2003 to promote the rights of workers in the cut flower industry. ILRF advocates on behalf of the workers, supports a legal center in Ecuador that helps them bring work-related grievances against their employers, and collaborates with certification initiatives like Fair Flowers Fair Plants (FFP) and Veriflora. =Child labor= Approximately 211 million of the world's children, between the ages of 5 and 14, work at least part-time, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the tripartite body representing governments, labor, and employees. Of these, 120 million children are working full-time to help support their impoverished families. Although child labor is most common in developing countries, it is found throughout the world, including in the United States. Many of these children are forced into the workforce to become beggars, farm hands, and factory workers. They are exposed to conditions extremely harmful to their physical and mental well-being. ILRF has helped develop programs to fight child labor and is involved in monitoring conditions in various regions of the world. ILRF is also currently engaged in two corporate campaigns related to child labor: one targeting the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company for their use of child labor on a rubber plantation in Liberia and the other focusing on the chocolate industry for child labor on cocoa farms in West Africa. =Rights For Working Women Campaign= ILRF has recently developed a Rights For Working Women Campaign which seeks to alleviate labor conditions that disproportionately affect working women in developing countries through research, public education, litigation, legislative action, and grassroots mobilization. To begin the campaign, ILRF has undertaken a global initiative to promote increased awareness of and viable remedies for the problem of workplace sexual harassment. As of 1997, there were only thirty-six countries with legislation specifically targeting sexual harassment. Of those countries, only 12 were from Latin America, the Caribbean or Africa. It is not uncommon for women to be subjected to bodily searches or fired for refusing sexual advances. The prevalence of subcontracting and other forms of \\"flexible\\" work arrangements in the global economy make it very difficult for women to organize against such abuse. =Accord on Fire and Building Safety= Designed to hold companies around the world accountable to worker safety in sweatshop conditions, ILRF created the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in 2012. As of July 2017, the accord has been signed by over 200 apparel companies. A list of 14 U.S. companies refused to sign the accord: Walmart, Gap, Macy's, Sears/Kmart, J. C. Penney, VF Corp., Target, Kohl's, Cato Fashions, Carter's, Nordstrom, American Eagle Outfitters, The Children's Place, and Foot Locker.

The traditional authority adopts the kingship title of Igwe Abagana. The current traditional ruler is His Majesty, Igwe Patrick Mbamalu Okeke. History There is no comprehensive documentary record of the origin of Abagana. There are basically three versions of the origin of Abagana as we could gather both from our raconteurs and few available records. Early Igbo history has it that Abagana, Nimo, Eziowelle, and Abba were related. According to this version, one man called Owelle migrated from an uncertain part of Igbo land, accompanied by his wife, Oma, and settled at a site between Nimo and Eziowelle in the old Onitsha district. This man gave birth to three sons and a daughter namely: Ezi (aka Eziowelle - as it is customary for the first son of any igbo family to inherit his father's obi i.e. home), Nimo, Abagana and Abba. The fact that these towns now have one central place where they worship and celebrate an ancestral feast of brotherhood called \\"Uta Nwanne na Nwanne\\" seems to lend credence to this assertion of common ancestral descent. Another version of the historical origin of Abagana had it that the father of \\"Abagana\\" whose name was given as 'Obum' came from an unknown place and settled at a place now known as \\"Nkwo Abagana\\". According to Late Chief Nwankwo Okakpu, a community leader and custodian of the peoples' culture, this man gave birth to nine children whose names are: Ogidi, Okpala, Chime, Okwui, Ene, Dejili, Akpuche, Ajilija, and Uru-Ochu. The above account seems to agree with the popular aphorism, Abagana Ebo teghete, i.e. Abagana of nine clans, which obviously obliterated the initial postulation of\\" Abagana Ebo n' ese, i.e. Abagana of five clans. Perhaps the most widely accepted account of the origin of Abagana is that a man called ‚ÄúAgana-Diese‚Äù founded Abagana. None of our oral narrators was sure of the exact place where this man migrated from, but a popular opinion and belief was that this man was banished by his people for committing an abomination and for this reason he fled his own community and settled at a place known to day as \\"Nkwo-Abagana\\". According to our sources mainly centenarian traditionalists, including Late Chief Ejiofor Amamchukwu (Chime Abagana), Chief Okoye Ogbantu, and Chief Okeke Ezechi; this man married and had six children, five males and one female, namely, Okpala, Diese, Akpuche, Uruochu, Ajilija, and Obum‚Äîthe only female. According to these sources, these five sons of Agana-Diese were the original inhabitants of the place now called \\"Abagana\\", and this perhaps was the reason why we originally had \\"Abagana Ebo-n' ese, i.e., Abagana of five clans. Still in line with this historical origin, a spiritual mound was erected at the ancestral place where Agana-Diese lived and reared his children. It is now at Nkwo-Abagana Square and today still serves as a symbol of unity as well as repository of spiritual power for the people of Abagana. In keeping with the tradition, a day is set aside in November every year to celebrate \\"Uta-Anu\\" feast of meat, as memorial for the bond of relationship. Our sources also had it that as time went on, \\"Okpala\\" who was then a prosperous farmer was in dire need of human assistance both for his farming activities and for physical protection of his vast and fast expanding territorial effluence. Initially, he hired a paid labourer to render the services, but as time went on, he came in contact with one great hunter called \\"Dunu\\" who used to come from Umunachi on hunting expeditions and engaged his services and later made him \\"Dunu\\", the manager of his labourers. It was gathered that Okpala later developed enormous interest in this great hunter such that he assigned a piece of land to him to build his own house and was also allowed to freely farm at available lands around his abode for his own personal purpose. For the above reason, as we were informed, this man called \\"Dunu\\" found good reason to settle down and later married a wife from Uru-Okpala village and gave birth to Kabi, Okpalachi, and Dilekwo. These three sons, according to our sources, now make up the three major kindred that today exist in the Umudunu village, Abagana. It is important to mention that other labourers who came together with Dunu, mainly from Awkuzu and other neighboring communities, were also allowed to co-habit the same areas with Dunu, but sometime later dispersed and went out either in Diaspora or back to their ancestral homes, but the remnants became diffused and mixed up with Dunu kindred. It is also worthy of mention that due to difficulties encountered by the children of Dunu in sourcing wives from the neighbouring communities, Dunu solved this problem by establishing a spiritual dimension called \\"Iti Ofo na Ala\\" which made it possible for a section of his own children to intermarry among themselves, and this has continued till today. Orofia is the second largest village in Abagana today in terms of population and land mass after Umudunu. As is the case with Umudunu, its founder was an immigrant called \\"Chime\\" (\\"Chima\\" in some dialects). According to further account of our sources, this Chime was a great warrior, adventurer, and statesman who came from \\"Ohafia\\" near Arochukwu in Abia State in search of slaves and merchandise. Some elders say that Chime rather came from Arochukwu but many of his followers were from Ohafia and environs. Our source had it that this man founded \\"Orofia\\" settlement in other towns like Nimo, Enugwu-Ukwu, Eziowelle, Alor, Umudioka, Ogbunike, Ogidi, Ukpo, Oraukwu, and others in the course of his numerous adventures and expeditions, but finally settled in Abagana with his soldiers of fortune and founded \\"Orofia village Abagana\\". Chime later married from Akpu Abagana and eventually crossed the River Niger with his family and followers, and in the course of the adventure, he founded Onicha Ugbo, Onicha Olona, Issele Ukwu, Issele Azagba, Issele Mkpitime, Obior, Onicha Mmiri, which are all part of the Ezechima clan in Igboland. Opinions of our sources and respondents agree that the name \\"Abagana\\" originated from an oral tradition that the founding father of Abagana was \\"Agana-Diese\\". Initially the people called themselves \\"Ebe-Agana\\" meaning Agana's palace. Later, during the pre-colonial era, her neighbors called them 'Mba-Agana' which means literally that strangers were not allowed passage from that land. This must be as a result of his war-like nature. During that period, colonial masters would set out from Onitsha via Awkuzu, Nando, Mgbakwu and traveled to Awka where they settled. Traveling through Abagana could have been easier and shorter for them, but the fear of Abagana was the beginning of wisdom to them. It was indeed the Europeans, who found it difficult to pronounce \\"Mba-Agana\\" that changed the name to \\"Abagana\\" for easy pronunciation just like they did in other places like Nawfia, Nawgu, Onitsha, Awkuzu etc. Abagana Ambush On March 31, 1968: Biafran army won their biggest battle. by ambushing and destroying a 96-vehicle column of Nigerian soldiers with locally hand made bomb called Ogbunigwe or bucket bomb. The humiliating Abagana defeat to Nigerian soldiers prompted General Yakubu Gowon to remove Col. Murtala Mohammed as the General Commanding Officer of the Onitsha sector.

It is also sometimes referred to as the Mexican leopard frog.

Bibliotheca Herpetologica. volume 12. number 1 & 2\\\\. pages 18-40. Physical description Rio Grande Leopard Frog (Lithobates berlandieri), from Cameron County, Texas, USA The Rio Grande leopard frogs grow from 2.2 to 4.5 inches in length. They are usually tan, brown, or pale green in color, with distinctive black spotting with prominent light-colored ridges down either side of their backs. Their noses are angular, and they have long, powerful legs with webbed feet. Ecology and behavior The species is primarily aquatic, and mostly nocturnal, though they can be often found during the day resting along the edge of the water. Despite their geographic range being mostly arid or semiarid, they inhabit permanent water sources, such as streams, creeks, and ponds. They are insectivorous, but like most frogs, will eat almost anything they can overpower and swallow. Mating occurs during the rainy periods of the spring and fall. The males make a rattling call which is loud enough to be heard a quarter mile or more away. Eggs are laid in large masses attached to aquatic vegetation.  Taxonomy  The Rio Grande leopard frog was once considered a subspecies of the northern leopard frog, but was later recognized as a distinct species due to distinct mating call and morphological differences. Recent research has placed Rio Grande leopard frogs in the Scurrilirana species group of the subgenus Pantherana.  Geographic range and status  Found from Central Texas to New Mexico (where it is listed as vulnerable), south to Mexico through the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras to northeastern Nicaragua, its presence uncertain in El Salvador. It is easily confused with other species that share its range, such as the Plains leopard frog (Lithobates blairi). It is unknown whether hybridization occurs. The species has also been introduced to the Colorado River in California and Arizona, and is known to be expanding its range south into Mexico in the state of Baja California. It is believed to be contributing to the population reduction of the lowland leopard frog, (Lithobates yavapaiensis), which is native to the region. This expansion of range is the primary factor in the Rio Grande leopard frog being classified as least concern, by the IUCN Red List.

It is situated on the Adriatic Sea between two other tourist towns, Eraclea and Bibione. History A panoramic view of Caorle, 2018 The ancient name of the city was Caprulae (possibly because of the wild goats that grazed in this area, or in honour of pagan goddess Capris); Caorle was founded in the 1st century BC by Romans. Many archeological findings confirm this attribution, for instance the sacrificial altar called Ara Licovia (Licovian Altar, from the Roman Licovi family), today housed in the cathedral. A safe zone between the estuaries of the Livenza (Latin: Liquentia) and Lemene (Latin: Romantinum) rivers, Caorle gained importance when people from Concordia Sagittaria arrived as refugees during the Barbarian Invasions. In that period was built a Paleo-Christian church, some remains of which are today kept in the cathedral's museum. In the 11th century the cathedral was built, which still stands today. It was once the seat of a bishopric. During the following centuries, Caorle became one of the nine important cities of the Republic of Venice; evidence to that effect are the many Istrian flagstones which compose some monuments in the city, and also the ancient structure of the city with bridge and canals, like a little Venice. At the end of the Republic of Venice, with the Napoleonic invasions, Caorle went into decline; the last diocesan bishop of the diocese was moved in 1807 to Chioggia and the territory of the diocese was attached in 1818 to the Patriarchate of Venice.Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, pp. 780-781Trino Bottani, Saggio di storia della citt√† di Caorle, Venezia 1811 No longer a residential bishopric, Caorle/Caprulae is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 857 Caorle was an important strategic location during World War I, until the Italian Army started its counteroffensive from the Piave. Territory Since the beginning of the 20th century the territory around Caorle has been deeply modified. Most of the woods of the \\"Selva Lupanica\\" were cut to give room to fields for cultivation, rivers were embanked, and marshes were reclaimed. This brought a landscape of wide flat areas, with no trees even along the rivers course. Along the coast, interment and erosion constantly modify the scenery. The landscape is still rather wild, with changing sandbanks and the fishing valleys. Main sights =Cathedral= The Cathedral of St. Stephen was built in 1038, an example of Romanesque and of the Byzantine-Ravennate style. Its fa√ßade is simple; near the central door there are two bas-reliefs (St. Agatonicus on the left, St. William on the right); the interior is organized with a nave and two side aisles, divided by pillars and columns which support semi-circular arches, and it has a truss-beam roof. It contains many masterpieces of the Venetian school of art, the most important of which is The Last Supper, painted by Gregorio Lazzarini (master of famous painter Tiepolo). The central apse has the remains of a 17th-century fresco; above the see there is the \\"Pala d'oro\\" (golden altar-piece), given by the queen Catherine Cornaro when, after a shipwreck, she found refuge in the Caprulan coasts. It is made up of a set of six panels, two for the Annunciation (Archangel Gabriel and Blessed Virgin Mary) and the other four for the prophets and Christ. From the roof, a 15th-century crucifix hangs above the modern high altar (the ancient one was sold along with many others; only four altars remain today). The cylindrical bell tower of the cathedral. Outside, the characteristic bell tower, dating to 1048, rises to a height of 48 meters. It is a typical example of Romanesque style, but it has a cylindrical structure, and it is surmounted by a cone-shaped cusp, that makes it unique in the world. The cathedral owns a liturgical museum, inaugurated on September 13, 1975 by Patriarch Albino Luciani (future Pope John Paul I) in the old bishops' chapel; it keep vestments, altar cloths and holy vessels of the Caprulan bishops, and of the Pope John XXIII, who was very attached to Caorle since he was also Patriarch of Venice. When he became Pope, his servants were two Caprulan brothers. In the museum, there are also a precious silver \\"Capitular Cross\\", six icons of the apostles (which formed the ancient iconostasis), painted by Venetian school of art in the 12th - 13th centuries, and a silver-gold reliquary, said of \\"the most precious Blood\\", which, according to tradition, contains some of the ground on which the bleeding Jesus Christ passed before he was crucified. Another important piece of the museum is the St Stephen reliquary, which contains the skull of Saint Stephen, Patron of Caorle. =Church of the Blessed Virgin of the Angel= The Church of the Blessed Virgin of the Angel on the sea. The Church of Blessed Virgin of the Angel is built on a little promontory on the sea. In ancient times, the church had three naves, but the sea repeatedly destroyed one of them, so in the 18th century the church was rebuilt, with the structure that it has today. The legend says that one day a number of fishermen saw a light on the sea; when they approached it, they found a statue of the Virgin Mary with the Child, and they carried it ashore. The bishop and the townspeople tried to carry the statue to the cathedral but it was very heavy; so the bishop called a group of children who, because of their innocence, succeeded in carrying it to the nearby church of Archangel Michael (for reason called the \\"Virgin of the Angel\\"). Devotion to the \\"Virgin of the sea\\" is very important to the Caprulans; to her are dedicated two festivals, the annual Feast of Incoronation, during which takes place the traditional \\"fire of the bell tower\\", with fireworks, and the Feast of the Virgin of the Angel which, in accordance with the wishes of Pope John XXIII, takes place every five years. Being the Church at the end of the waterfront promenade the bell tower is used as lighthouse. Tourism The beach Caorle is a small city, but is frequented by tourists in all seasons. The old town centre is still structured as a little Venetian corner, with its coloured houses, its \\"calli\\" (alleys) and \\"campielli\\" (squares). During the summer many family-oriented activities take place on its long beach. Others are organized in its lagoon (an example of Venetian lagoon), where many characteristic traditional \\"casoni\\" (the huts where fishermen lived in the winter while fishing) still stand. Notable people Recently, the city of Caorle gave honorary citizenship to Rigoberta Mench√∫ Tum (Nobel Peace Prize) and to Cardinal Angelo Scola, Patriarch of Venice.

History The Dominion of Newfoundland became the 10th province of Canada when it entered Confederation on March 31, 1949. At that time, CNR took over the operations of the Newfoundland Railway, a narrow gauge railway network running across the island. At the time that CNR took over operations, the premiere cross-island passenger train was called The Overland Limited. CNR renamed this train in 1950 to the Caribou and it maintained approximately the same 23-hour schedule from St. John's (also the eastern terminus of the railway on Newfoundland), to the system's western terminus at the ferry terminal in Port aux Basques, where connecting ferry services to the North American railway network at North Sydney, Nova Scotia, were made. The 23 hour schedule sealed the fate of the Caribou when the Trans-Canada Highway opened across the island in 1965, allowing automobiles to travel between Port aux Basques and St. John's in under 12 hours. CN withdrew the dedicated passenger trains in July 1969 and instituted a bus service, marketed under the name \\"Road Cruiser.\\" CN maintained limited \\"mixed\\" passenger and freight train service to certain isolated communities on the island until the complete abandonment of its narrow gauge system in the fall of 1988.

Longuet and his wife and sons are also buried here Jean-Laurent-Frederick Longuet (1876-1938) was a French socialist politician and journalist. He was Karl Marx's grandson. Early years Jean, often called 'Johnny' as a boy by his family, was born in London on 10 May 1876, the son of Charles and Jenny Longuet. He was their second son, and the eldest who survived to adulthood. The family often visited Jenny's father, Karl Marx, who liked to play with his grandchildren. The Longuet family moved to France in February 1881. In summer 1882 Karl Marx stayed with the Longuets for three months, being joined by Jean's aunt Eleanor Marx. By this time Jenny was suffering from bladder cancer, and would die a year later. To ease the burden on the family, Eleanor took Jean back to England in August 1882, promising to educate and discipline him. They became close, with Eleanor thinking of him as ‚Äòmy boy‚Äô. On his return to France, Jean lived for a time with his father's family in Caen to continue his studies. Political career After attending university in Paris, Longuet worked as a journalist and trained as a lawyer. He worked for L'Humanit√© and was a founder and editor of the newspaper Le Populaire. He was active in one of France's principal socialist parties ‚Äì the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) ‚Äì and served both as a mayor and as a member of the French Chamber of Deputies. During the First World War he was a pacifist, but also supported war credits. At the Strasbourg Congress in 1918 his policy was adopted by the majority of the SFIO socialist party. After the Tours Congress of 1920 where the Communists gained the majority, he supported the minority and joined the centrist Two-and-a-half International (the Vienna Union). He criticized the League Against Imperialism created in 1927 and supported by the Comintern. Longuet supported pro-Zionist positions at the Socialist International meeting in Brussels in 1930‚ÄùThe sessions which adopted the pro-Zionist resolution was presided over by Emile Vandervelde, Belgian Socialist leader and friend of Zionism. Among the supporters of the resolution were Leon Blum, French-Jewish Socialist; Jean Longuet; Pierre Renaudel; and M. Turati, Italian Socialist leader (‚ÄùSocialist International Urges Britain to Facilitate Jewish Immigration, Colonization,‚Äù Jewish Telegraphic Agency, 7 August 1930). and at a speech to a Zionist group in Paris in 1935.‚ÄúJean Longuet, grandson of Karl Marx, father of modern Socialist, announced himself as a Zionist in a speech to a Zionist group here‚Äù (The Sentinel (Chicago), 30 May 1935, p. 29). Death and family Jean Longuet married Anita Desvaux (1875‚Äì1960) in 1900. They had two sons: the lawyer and journalist Robert-Jean Longuet (1901‚Äì1987) and the sculptor Karl-Jean Longuet (1904‚Äì1981). Jean's younger brother Edgar Longuet, a physician, was also an active socialist. Longuet died after a car accident in September 1938 aged 61. He was buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, in the same grave as his aunt and uncle, Laura and Paul Lafargue. Longuet's wife and two sons were later buried in the same grave.

Jenny earned a meagre income for the pair working as a private tutor, giving lessons in French, German, and singing. The couple's financial lives became more stable in 1874, when both Jenny and Charles found work as teachers, with Jenny holding a position as a German teacher at the St Clement Danes School.Padover, Karl Marx, pp. 477-478. The minimal salary she earned at the school was supplemented by giving private lessons.Padover, Karl Marx, pg. 478.

Set in Nome, Alaska during the 1898 Gold Rush, the film is about a gold prospector and a corrupt Alaska politician who fight for control over a gold mine. The film features a spectacular saloon fistfight between Cooper and William \\"Stage\\" Boyd. The Spoilers was adapted to screen by Bartlett Cormack from the 1906 Rex Beach novel of the same name. Film versions also appeared in 1914, 1923 (with Noah Beery as McNamara), 1942 (with John Wayne in Gary Cooper's role of Glennister, Marlene Dietrich replacing Compson, whom she resembled, as Malotte, and Randolph Scott as McNamara), and 1955 (with Anne Baxter as Malotte, Jeff Chandler as Glennister, and Rory Calhoun as McNamara). The 1930 and 1942 versions were the only instance of Gary Cooper and John Wayne playing exactly the same role in the same story in two different films. Plot While traveling to Nome, Alaska, Roy Glenister (Gary Cooper) meets beautiful Helen Chester (Kay Johnson), who soon becomes his sweetheart. Glenister is one of several owners of a lucrative mine called The Midas. When he arrives in Nome, he discovers that his partners, Slapjack Simms (Slim Summerville) and Joe Dextry (James Kirkwood), are in the middle of a legal dispute with three corrupt officials: United States Marshal Voorhees (Jack Holmes), Judge Stillman (Lloyd Ingraham), and a politician named Alec McNamara (William \\"Stage\\" Boyd ). They have been engaged in a racket claiming titles to various mines, ejecting the miners, and then making McNamara owner of the disputed properties. The three corrupt officials lay claim to The Midas. McNamara also steals money from Glenister, Dextry, and Slapjack, preventing them from enlisting legal help from the United States. When Dextry and Glenister plan a vigilante action, McNamara calls in a detail of soldiers to protect \\"his property\\". As Glenister and McNamara prepare for a gunfight, they are dissuaded by Helen, who suggests that the courts handle the dispute. Later, after jealous saloon owner Cherry Malotte (Betty Compson) lies to Glennister telling him that Helen and McNamara are conspiring to cheat him again, Glennister and McNamara settle their differences with a spectacular fistfight, with McNamara getting the worst. Afterwards, Glenister wins the hand of Helen.

Reception In his review for The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall gave the film a negative review for its poor narrative, unconvincing plot, and \\"absurdly melodramatic dialogue\\". Believing that the film would have benefitted from more details of the working for gold and fewer scenes in gambling halls and other places, Hall continued: Finally, Hall criticized the film's \\"general lack of intelligence\\" and the narrative, which \\"runs from one scene to another with too much threatening talk and an ineffectual misunderstanding between Glenister and Helen Chester, who are in love with each other.\\" References External links  Category:1930 films Category:American films Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Films directed by Edwin Carewe Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:1930 Western (genre) films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Films based on Western (genre) novels Category:Films set in Alaska Category:American black-and-white films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:Films based on The Spoilers (Beach novel) Category:American film remakes Category:Sound film remakes of silent films ","title":"The Spoilers (1930 film)"},{"id":"5679969","text":"A Block and bleed manifold is a hydraulic manifold that combines one or more block/isolate valves, usually ball valves, and one or more bleed/vent valves, usually ball or needle valves, into one component for interface with other components (pressure measurement transmitters, gauges, switches, etc.) of a hydraulic (fluid) system. The purpose of the block and bleed manifold is to isolate or block the flow of fluid in the system so the fluid from upstream of the manifold does not reach other components of the system that are downstream. Then they bleed off or vent the remaining fluid from the system on the downstream side of the manifold. For example, a block and bleed manifold would be used to stop the flow of fluids to some component, then vent the fluid from that component‚Äôs side of the manifold, in order to effect some kind of work (maintenance/repair/replacement) on that component.  Types of valves  = Block and Bleed = A block and bleed manifold with one block valve and one bleed valve is also known as an isolation valve or block and bleed valve; a block and bleed manifold with multiple valves is also known as an isolation manifold. This valve is used in combustible gas trains in many industrial applications. Block and bleed needle valves are used in hydraulic and pneumatic systems because the needle valve allows for precise flow regulation when there is low flow in a non-hazardous environment. = Double Block and Bleed (DBB Valves) = These valves replace existing traditional techniques employed by pipeline engineers to generate a double block and bleed configuration in the pipeline. Two block valves and a bleed valve are as a unit, or manifold, to be installed for positive isolation. Used for critical process service, DBB valves are for high pressure systems or toxic/hazardous fluid processes. Applications that use DBB valves include instrument drain, chemical injection connection, chemical seal isolation, and gauge isolation. DBB valves do the work of three separate valves (2 isolations and 1 drain) and require less space and have less weight. = Cartridge Type Standard Length DBB = This type of Double Block and Bleed Valves have a patented design which incorporates two ball valves and a bleed valve into one compact cartridge type unit with ANSI B16.5 tapped flanged connections. The major benefit of this design configuration is that the valve has the same face-to- face dimension as a single block ball valve (as specified in API 6D and ANSI B16.10), which means the valve can easily be installed into an existing pipeline without the need for any pipeline re-working. = Three Piece Non Standard Length DBB = This type of Double Block and Bleed Valves (DBB Valves) feature the traditional style of flange-by-flange type valve and is available with ANSI B16.5 flanges, hub connections and welded ends to suit the pipeline system it is to be installed in. It features all the benefits of the single unit DBB valve, with the added benefit of a bespoke face-to-face dimension if required. = Single Unit DBB = This design also has operational advantages, there are significantly fewer potential leak paths within the double block and bleed section of the pipeline. Because the valves are full bore with an uninterrupted flow orifice they have got a negligible pressure drop across the unit. The pipelines where these valves are installed can also be pigged without any problems. There are several advantages in using a Double Block and Bleed Valve. Significantly, because all the valve components are housed in a single unit, the space required for the installation is dramatically reduced thus freeing up room for other pieces of essential equipment. Considering the operations and procedures executed before an operator can intervene, the Double Block and Bleed manifold offers further advantages over the traditional hook up. Due to the volume of the cavity between the two balls being so small, the operator is afforded the opportunity to evacuate this space efficiently thereby quickly establishing a safe working environment.

It was first described by Darier in 1916.J. Darier. De l‚Äô√©ryth√®me annulaire centrifuge (√©ryth√®me papulo-circine√© migrateuse et chronique) et de quelques √©ruptions analogues. Annales de dermatologie et de syphilographie, Paris, 1916-1917, 5: 57-58. Many different terms have been used to classify these types of lesions and it is still controversial on what exactly defines EAC. Some of the types include annular erythema (deep and superficial), erythema perstans, erythema gyratum perstans, erythema gyratum repens, darier erythema (deep gyrate erythema) and erythema figuratum perstans. Symptoms Occurring at any age these lesions appear as raised pink-red ring or bulls-eye marks. They range in size from . The lesions sometimes increase size and spread over time and may not be complete rings but irregular shapes. Distribution is usually on the thighs and legs but can also appear on the upper extremities, areas not exposed to sunlight, trunk or face. Currently EAC is not known to be contagious, but as many cases are incorrectly diagnosed as EAC, it is difficult to be certain. Causes Often no specific cause for the eruptions is found. However, it is sometimes linked to underlying diseases and conditions such as: * Food (including blue cheese or tomatoes). * Contact Dermatitis (i.e. cleaning agents, fabric softeners, etc.) * Fungal, Bacterial and Viral infections such as sinusitis, tuberculosis, candidiasis or tinea. * Drugs including finasteride, etizolam (and benzodiazepines), chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, oestrogen, penicillin and amitriptyline. * Cancer (especially the type known as erythema gyratum perstans, in which there are concentric and whirling rings). * Primary biliary cirrhosis. * Graves disease. * Appendicitis. * Lupus * Pregnancy (EAC usually disappears/stops soon after delivery of baby). * Hormone (Contraceptive Pill, Stress, Hormone Drugs) * Lyme disease Diagnosis Micrograph of erythema annulare centrifugum, showing a moderately intense superficial perivascular dermal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with rare eosinophils, edema of papillary dermis, hyperkeratosis and focal epidermal spongiosis. A skin biopsy can be performed to test for EAC; tests should be performed to rule out other possible diseases such as: pityriasis rosea, tinea corporis, psoriasis, nummular eczema, atopic dermatitis, drug reaction, erythema migrans and other rashes. = Differential diagnosis = * Sarcoidosis * Fungal infection * Lupus erythematosus Treatment No treatment is usually needed as they usually go away anywhere from months to years. The lesions may last from anywhere between 4 weeks to 34 years with an average duration of 11 months. If caused by an underlying disease or malignancy, then treating and removing the disease or malignancy will stop the lesions. It usually doesn't require treatment, but topical corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing redness, swelling and itchiness. Some supported and not supported methods of having an effect on EAC include: * Photosensitive so it can be moved/reduced with appropriate sunlight. * Vitamin D * Immune system - hence it will increase in size/number when the immune system is low or overloaded. * Hormone Drugs * Disulone * Stress reduction * Topical calcipotriol - a topical vitamin D derivative has been known to be beneficial Epidemiology  It is very rare and estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 per year. Because of its rarity the documentation, cases and information are sparse and not a huge amount is known for certain, meaning that EAC could actually be a set of many un-classified skin lesions. It is known to occur at all ages and all genders equally. Some articles state that women are more likely to be affected than men.

During the Congress, the majority voted to join the communist Third International and create the French Section of the Communist International, which became the French Communist Party in 1921. The SFIO divided itself in three factions during the Congress: * The larger one gathered those who had accepted the Third International's 21 Conditions behind Fernand Loriot, Boris Souvarine, Ludovic Frossard, and Marcel Cachin. They did not, however, accept all of Lenin's conditions, and no vote on the matter took place. This left- wing faction, formed by the younger leaders of the party and most of the SFIO's members, obtained three-quarters of the votes and split away to form the French Section of the Communist International (Section Fran√ßaise de l'Internationale Communiste, or SFIC). They took with them the party paper L'Humanit√©, founded by Jean Jaur√®s in 1904. L'Humanit√© remained tied to the party until the 1990s. * The second faction was led by a minority who accepted the adhesion to the Third International, but only under specific conditions. They finally allied themselves to the third faction. * The third faction led by L√©on Blum and most elected socialists (including Paul Faure and Jean Longuet), who completely refused Lenin's conditions and preferred staying inside of the Second International. Blum, who would become Prime Minister during the 1936‚Äì1938 Popular Front, famously declared: \\"Someone has to stay and keep the old house.\\"L√©on Blum: Nous sommes convaincus jusqu'au fond de nous-m√™mes que, pendant que vous irez courir l'aventure, il faut que quelqu'un reste garder la vieille maison...

According to Gramsci, this explained in part the popularity of the Third International, all the more since the socialist deputies and the CGT officials were accused of not having done anything, and thus of \\"treason to the French working class\\". Hence the SFIO split in two: the SFIC (3,208 votes) and the SFIO (1,022 votes). The next year, the CGT trade-union also split, with the creation of the Communist Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail unitaire (CGTU), which itself merged again with the CGT at the 1936 Toulouse Congress during the Popular Front.

Set in Nome, Alaska during the 1898 Gold Rush, it culminates in a spectacular saloon fistfight between Glennister (Chandler) and McNamara (Calhoun). Film versions also appeared in 1914, 1923 (with Noah Beery, Sr. as McNamara), 1930 (with Gary Cooper as Glennister and Betty Compson as Malotte), and 1942 (with John Wayne as Glennister, Betty Compson lookalike Marlene Dietrich as Malotte, and Randolph Scott as McNamara). The 1930 and 1942 versions were the only instances of Gary Cooper and John Wayne playing the same role in the same story in two different films; Jeff Chandler portrays the part in this version.  Plot  Struggling miners Flapjack and Banty go to the office of Alex McNamara, the new gold commissioner in Nome, Alaska, to complain about claim jumpers. He isn't there, so they drown their sorrows at Cherry Malotte's gambling house and saloon. Cherry looks ready to steal the men's claim herself in Alex's office when he suddenly appears. He assures her Judge Stillman is on his way to Nome to review all legal matters regarding the mines. When a ship arrives bringing her sweetheart Roy Glennister back to town, Cherry runs out eagerly to meet it, to the jealousy of Blackie, her croupier. To her anger, Roy is traveling with an attractive stranger, Helen Chester. An irate Cherry leaves in a huff with Roy's co-owner of a nearby mine, Dextry. Roy insists he still loves Cherry, but she slaps his face. Alex and the newly arrived Judge Stillman set out to survey and inspect Roy's mine, insisting it will take weeks before any claims can be settled. Roy is shocked to observe that Alex, the Judge and Helen are all conspirators to steal the miners' claims. Blackie shoots the town marshal and makes sure Roy is blamed and arrested for it. A jailbreak is arranged, but Cherry rushes to warn Roy of what she has learned from Helen, that as soon as he escapes, Alex is planning to ambush Roy and make it look like a lawful shooting. A shootout between Alex and the miners ensues. Blackie dies, but not before confessing to the sheriff's murder, while Roy and Alex end up in a knockdown, drag-out fistfight. Cherry and Roy ultimately end up happily in love and in legal possession of the mine.

Highlights of the collection include one of the world's most complete sets of the works of Isaac Newton, including books owned and annotated by Newton, as well as some sixty manuscripts by Newton, and important manuscript and print materials by Louis Pasteur, a 1544 edition of Archimedes' mathematical text Philosophi ac Geometrae and many important original works from the 18th and 19th centuries. Generally, the collection's strengths are in the early modern period, and include strong holdings in the history of mathematics, astronomy, and color theory. The \\"Burndy\\" appellation was invented by Dibner and represents a portmanteau or blend of his first and last names. The library was originally located at the Burndy Engineering Company in Norwalk, Connecticut. In 1974 Dibner donated one-quarter of the library holdings to the Smithsonian Institution to form the nucleus of its research library in the history of science and technology. In 1976, the Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology opened at the Smithsonian Institution, and it remains part of the Smithsonian Institution Libraries housed at the National Museum of American History, Behring Center in Washington, DC.Dibner Library The remainder of the Burndy Library collection remained in Norwalk until after Bern Dibner's death in 1988. It was moved to the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1992 with the establishment of the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology. After residing there for more than a decade, the collection needed to be moved due to the pending demolition of the building which housed it. In November 2006, the approximately 67,000 volumes of the Burndy Library (47,000 rare books and 20,000 reference books), along with several hundred small manuscript collections and a collection of artwork and objects, were transferred to The Huntington Library in San Marino, California as a gift of the Dibner family and the Dibner Fund. The library offers a number of history of science fellowships, a lecture series and an annual conference.Dibner History of Science Program. It is one of the Huntington's most heavily used collections, and continues to grow and expand through the Huntington's multi-faceted approach to collection use, conservation and management.

A significant figure in Argentine basketball, he defended Argentina for 2 titles, and Atenas for 14 club titles. He was twice named MVP. He was the player with most assists at the 1994 FIBA World Cup.\\"Pepe va por otro trono m√°s\\" Ol√© sports newspaper A one club man, he played all his professional life with Atenas. Playing career =Clubs= Milanesio began basketball at the Military Factory of R√≠o Tercero, where he was affectionately known as \\"Tachuela\\". He and his brother Mario joined club Atenas in 1982 and debuted in the senior squad on June 2, in a match of local league \\"Torneo Le√≥n Zakalian\\" organised by the Argentine Basketball Association. In that game Atenas beat Uni√≥n San Vicente, and Milanesio scored 4 points. His brother Mario also debuted that same night playing for Atenas, and was the topscorer of the match with 22 points. The first official game for Atenas came on August 9, when they beat Club Argentino of Villa Cabrera 108‚Äì51, with Milanesio scoring 16 points. Milanesio's first title came in 1983, when Atenas won the C√≥rdoba Basketball Association championship. It was in 1984 that the then-National League transitioned to the \\"Liga Nacional de B√°squetbol\\", when Atenas lost the semifinals to River Plate, being eliminated. One year later, the first season of LNB started. Atenas qualified for the finals, then losing to Ferro Carril Oeste 2‚Äì1, after the third game ended 95‚Äì86 for FCO. At the end of the season, Milanesio had played 37 matches and scored 415 points (an average of 11,12). It would be the first of his 649 consecutive games played for Atenas. In the next season, Atenas was eliminated by Ferro C.O. in semifinals after a 3‚Äì2 score. He suffered an injury before the beginning of the 1998‚Äì99 season that benched for the first time in his career. When he returned to play, Atenas won a championship. He never played for the national team after his injury. In 2002, he retired from professional basketball, with 14 Championships with Atenas, and 2 with the national team. Known for his efficiency of external shots, he reached an average point score of 43.9% for three in the 848 matches in the 18 seasons he was with Atenaso, the first 649 without missing a side match. His community activities gave him public and institutional recognition. He was declared illustrious citizen of the cities of Hernando, R√≠o Tercero, San Marcos Sierra and C√≥rdoba. In 1993 he was honored with the inaugural \\"decade\\" Golden Olimpia Award for Basketball, ten years later it was given to Emanuel Gin√≥bili. =Argentina national team= Milanesio defended Argentina and won the 1987 South American Championship in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. He was Argentina's main point guard, at the 1990 FIBA World Championship, hosted by Argentina. Argentina brought home their inaugural gold medal at the 1995 Pan American Games, having defeated the Team USA, in the final of the 1995 Pan American Games, in Mar del Plata, Argentina. Coaching career Milanesio currently works on sharing his experience and knowledge of the game. In 2004, he organised his first National Campus at Villa Carlos Paz, which has since successfully repeated every year, and receive around 150 children and teenagers from Argentina, andfrom neighbouring Bolivia and Chile.

Like other species of cave salamanders, they are almost entirely subterranean, living in spring waters deep in limestone rock strata, so gauging the exact extent of their geographic range or even their population numbers is virtually impossible. This also leads to reduced sampling for study, which has led to some uncertainty in the taxonomic classification; some sources consider all species of Texas cave salamanders to be subspecies of the Texas salamander. Eurycea neotenes and Eurycea rathbuni also live in caves and eat small insects and spiders.  Description  The Cascade Caverns salamander is translucent, with a faint net-shaped pattern that is brown in color, often with white speckling. The species is rarely seen, so the amount of variation in their coloration is unknown. They are neotenic, meaning they retain characteristics into adulthood that are usually associated with juvenile salamanders, such as external gills. They have stout bodies, with short legs, and reduced eyes set under a layer of skin. This species of salamanders is threatened and could become endangered.  References  * Chippindale, P.T., A.H.

It is located in Toulouse. In 2007, Ensica merged with Supa√©ro to form the Institut sup√©rieur de l'a√©ronautique et de l'espace (ISAE). Ensica recruits its students from the French \\"Concours des Grandes √âcoles\\". A competitive examination which requires studies at the \\"classes pr√©paratoires\\". Classes pr√©paratoires last two years where students are to work intensively on mathematics and physics. Studies at Ensica last 3 years where students eventually get a Master in Aeronautics. Area of studies cover all the fundamentals of aeronautics, including: aerodynamics, structures, fluid dynamics, thermal power, electronics, control theory, airframe systems, IT... Students are also trained to management, manufacturing, certification, and foreign languages. Main employers are Airbus, Thales, Dassault, Safran (Sagem, Snecma), Rolls Royce, Astrium, Eurocopter.  History  The decree giving birth to the \\"Ecole Nationale des Travaux A√©ronautiques\\" (ENTA) was signed in 1945. The text was then ratified by Charles de Gaulle, president of the temporary government, and by Ren√© Pleven, Finance Minister. There were 25 students in the first class and 24 of them joined the \\"Ing√©nieurs Militaires des Travaux de l'Air\\" (IMTA). In 1957, the school changed its name to the \\"Ecole Nationale d'Ing√©nieurs des Constructions A√©ronautiques\\" (ENICA).The course was extended to three years and the school embarked on its new civil vocation welcoming a higher proportion of civil students. In 1961, ENICA was transferred to Toulouse, the director at that time being Emile Blouin. It then took on a new dimension and established its identity. In 1969, the school joined the competitive entrance examination system organised by the Ecoles Nationales Sup√©rieures d'Ing√©nieurs (ENSI). It thus increased its recruitment standards to become one of the leading French schools. This excellence was rewarded in 1979 when it received the M√©daille de l'A√©ronautique from G√©n√©ral Georges Bousquet: ENICA then became ENSICA, Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Ing√©nieurs de Constructions A√©ronautiques. The eighties were marked by a profound diversification in the training courses offered: opening of a \\"Mast√®re\\" degree and an Advanced Studies degree (DEA) in automatic control and mechanics, specialisations in aircraft maintenance and helicopter techniques. ENSICA became the top-listed school for students with pass marks in ENSI competitive entrance examinations and continuously increased the part set aside for research. It also internationalised its training by implementing exchange programmes with English, American and German institutes and universities. In 1994, ENSICA became a public establishment and can now sign, in its own name, agreements and conventions with other organisations and receive research contracts. Today, ENSICA has a staff of 150 people including 25 scientific directors and almost 700 part-time lecturers. The school can accommodate more than 400 students on the initial training courses and the same number of persons doing further training. The 50th class recently graduated. It included a total of 98 graduates 11 students of which did their third year of studies in a foreign university (USA, Great Britain, Germany and Sweden) and a high number of students who carried out their end of study projects abroad.  Missions  A public establishment under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence, ENSICA gives technological teaching courses for civil and military engineering students and offers a range of training: * \\"Dipl√¥me d'Ingenieur\\" (engineer's diploma) course; * training for and through scientific research; * a set of \\"Mast√®re Sp√©cialis√©\\" courses; * further education courses; * research. The engineer's course lasts three years.  Departments of Ensica  At ENSICA, research and training are integrated into the four training and research departments: avionics and systems, mechanical engineering, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics and computer science. All the departments are composed with a scientific staff. The staff is composed by lecturers-researchers with Ph.D's, lecturers and senior lecturers from universities and full professors. They are responsible for the research work and pedagogical engineering, as well as the coordination of the lecturers' teams. By this way, they actively participate in international actions and in industrial relations. The lecturers come, for one third, from the university and research world, for one fourth from industry and one fourth from the DGA. Human, economics, social, linguistics and multi-cultural training is under the responsibility of three departments: human and social sciences, sports and languages. Main departments are Avionics, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Dynamics and Mathematics  Avionics  The Avionics & Systems Department develop : \\\\- In the first year a basic training in: Signal processing, Automatic System and Electrical Engineering. \\\\- In the third year, two advanced itineraries are proposed into the field : *Signals - Communications *Control - Avionics The Department trains at these multidisciplinary itineraries : *Aircraft system *Space systems *Control - Guidance *Radar - Telecommunications Preparation for the post-graduate diplomas DEA (Advanced Studies Diploma) : *Signals - images - acoustics *automatics systems. These two itineraries allow, respectively, the preparation for the postgraduate diplomas signals-images-acoutics and automatic systems. =Taught subjects= *Functional approach of electronics and electric engineering *Strong theorical bases of signal processing allowing a use in image processing, radar and telecommunications. *Optics and optronics bases. *Antennas and radars theories and applications in the aeronautical and spatial domains. *Approach of real-time systems based on a concrete system built on a micro controller. *Finally, control : from modelisation and control of simple processes to applied advanced methods in the aeronautical domain.  Mechanical engineering  The aim of the Mechanical engineering Department's curriculum is to provide the students with basic knowledge in mechanics indispensable for their future jobs as engineers and this within a multidisciplinary aerospace training framework. The Mechanical Engineering courses lasts three years and includes : \\\\- basic training including fundamental knowledge mainly concerning calculation of structures and technological knowledge of mechanisms, manufacturing and materials, - training applied to aeronautics and space; this part increasing progressively throughout the three years. This common core is complemented, within the scope the third-year optional modules, by courses given at ENSICA for the Mechanical Engineering advanced studies degree and more specialised courses related to aeronautics and space. The Mechanical Engineering Department also coordinates the school's space activities: this specific space training corresponds to around 250 hours and development is oriented both towards ultralight systems and manned flight engineering.  Fluid Dynamics  The courses given by the Fluid Mechanics Department concern the thermodynamics of irreversible processes and continuum mechanics. The courses in these two disciplines are given in the first year and are completed by a basic fluid mechanics course (general equations of the movement of a Newtonian fluid and inviscid fluid movements). In the second year, the studies concern the flow of incompressible viscous fluids and compressible inviscid fluids dealing with the boundary layer, shock wave and turbulence phenomena with complements in unsteady fluid hypersonic and mechanical phenomena. From these theoretical bases, aeronautical applications are introduced in the second year. They mainly concern: external aerodynamics plus flight mechanics and handling qualities. aeronautical turbine engines.  Mathematics  The goals of CS training are: (1) to study the methods for developing programs (specification methods, object-oriented design, structured programming algorithms, testing); (2) to learn the basics of algorithmics (3) in-depth study of object programming, and learning an object-oriented methodology that uses UML as modeling notation; (4) to study the specific features of \\"Real-Time\\" applications and systems and of new-generation network architectures in close association with the research work carried out in the department. Practical implementations of theoretical concepts are based on Java language; ENSICA is co-accredited for issuing the Toulouse Systems Postgraduate School's Computer-based Systems DEAs (Advanced Studies Degrees) in cooperation with UPS science university, INSA and SUPAERO engineering schools, and the Toulouse CS and Telecommunications Postgraduate School's Networks and Telecommunications DEAs in cooperation with INPT engineering school, UPS science university, SUPAERO, INSA, ENST and ENAC engineering schools.  Training periods and international perspectives  During the 3 years, students of Ensica have the opportunity of studying for one semester or one year abroad, or make a one-year additional training period in a company.

The Arabic and Berber groups of languages are distantly related, both being members of the Afro-Asiatic family. The Sahara dialects are notably more conservative than those of coastal cities (see Tuareg languages). Over the years, Berber peoples have been influenced by other cultures with which they came in contact: Nubians, Greeks, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Romans, Vandals, Arabs, and lately Europeans. The cultures of the Maghreb and the Sahara therefore combine indigenous Berber, Arab and elements from neighboring parts of Africa and beyond. In the Sahara, the distinction between sedentary oasis inhabitants and nomadic Bedouin and Tuareg is particularly marked. The diverse peoples of the Sahara are usually categorized along ethno-linguistic lines. In the Maghreb, where Arab and Berber identities are often integrated, these lines can be blurred. Some Berber-speaking North Africans may identify as \\"Arab\\" depending on the social and political circumstances, although substantial numbers of Berbers (or Imazighen) have retained a distinct cultural identity which in the 20th century has been expressed as a clear ethnic identification with Berber history and language. Arabic-speaking Northwest Africans, regardless of ethnic background, often identify with Arab history and culture and may share a common vision with other Arabs. This, however, may or may not exclude pride in and identification with Berber and/or other parts of their heritage. Berber political and cultural activists for their part, often referred to as Berberists, may view all Northwest Africans as principally Berber, whether they are primarily Berber- or Arabic-speaking (see also Arabized Berber). The Nile Valley through northern Sudan traces its origins to the ancient civilizations of Egypt and Kush. The Egyptians over the centuries have shifted their language from Egyptian to modern Egyptian Arabic, while retaining a sense of national identity that has historically set them apart from other people in the region. Most Egyptians are Sunni Muslim and a significant minority adheres to Coptic Christianity. In Nubia, straddling Egypt and Sudan, a significant population retains the ancient Nubian language but has adopted Islam. The northern part of the Sudan is home to a largely Arab Muslim population, but further down the Nile Valley, the largely non-Muslim Nilotic and Nuba peoples begin. North Africa formerly had a large Jewish population, almost all of whom emigrated to France or Israel when the North African nations gained independence. A smaller number went to Canada. Prior to the modern establishment of Israel, there were about 600,000-700,000 Jews in Northern Africa, including both Sfardƒ´m (refugees from France, Spain and Portugal from the Renaissance era) as well as indigenous MizrƒÅ·∏•√Æm. Today, fewer than fifteen thousand remain in the region‚Äîalmost all in Morocco and Tunisia‚Äîand are mostly part of a French speaking urban elite. (See Jewish exodus from Arab lands.) Algeria Mosque in Algiers Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. Famous novelists of the 20th century include Mohammed Dib, Albert Camus, and Kateb Yacine, while Assia Djebar is widely translated. Important novelists of the 1980s included Rachid Mimouni, later vice-president of Amnesty International, and Tahar Djaout, murdered by an Islamist group in 1993 for his secularist views.Tahar Djaout French Publishers' Agency and France Edition, Inc. (accessed 4 April 2006) As early as Roman times, Apuleius, in M'Daourouch, was native to what would become Algeria. In philosophy and the humanities, Malek Bennabi and Frantz Fanon are noted for their thoughts on decolonization, while Augustine of Hippo was born in Tagaste (about 60 miles from the present day city of Annaba), and Ibn Khaldun, though born in Tunis, wrote the Muqaddima while staying in Algeria. Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by Islam, the main religion. The works of the Sanusi family in pre-colonial times, and of Emir Abdelkader and Sheikh Ben Badis in colonial times, are widely noted. The Algerian musical genre best known abroad is ra√Ø, a pop-flavored, opinionated take on folk music, featuring international stars such as Khaled and Cheb Mami. However, in Algeria itself the older, highly verbal chaabi style remains more popular, with such stars as El Hadj El Anka or Dahmane El Harrachi, while the tuneful melodies of Kabyle music, exemplified by Idir, Ait Menguellet, or Loun√®s Matoub, have a wide audience. For more classical tastes, Andalusi music, brought from Al-Andalus by Morisco refugees, is preserved in many older coastal towns. Egypt Egyptian culture has six thousand years of recorded history. Ancient Egypt was among the earliest civilizations. For millennia, Egypt maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. After the Pharaonic era, Egypt itself came under the influence of Hellenism, for a time Christianity, and later, Arab and Islamic culture. Today, many aspects of Egypt's ancient culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern Western culture, itself with roots in Ancient Egypt. Egypt's capital city, Cairo, is Africa's largest city and has been renowned for centuries as a center of learning, culture and commerce. Egypt has had a thriving media and arts industry since the late 19th century, today with more than 30 satellite channels and over 100 motion pictures produced each year. Cairo in fact has long been known as the \\"Hollywood of the East.\\" To bolster its media industry further, especially with the keen competition from the Persian Gulf Arab States and Lebanon, a large media city was built. Egypt is also the only Arabic-speaking country with an opera house.Egyptian folk musicians Some famous Egyptians include: *Saad Zaghlul (leader of first modern Egyptian revolution; founder of Wafd political party) *Gamal Abdel Nasser (former president and mastermind of the present republic) *Anwar Sadat (former president; winner of the Nobel Peace Prize) *Boutros Boutros-Ghali (former Secretary General of the United Nations) *Naguib Mahfouz (Nobel Prize-winning novelist) *Umm Kulthum (singer) *Omar Sharif (actor) *Ahmed Zewail (Nobel Prize-winning chemist) *Mohamed ElBaradei (Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency; 2005 Nobel Peace Prize Winner) For more famous Egyptians, see List of Egyptians and Egyptians Libya Qasr El Haj, 150 kilometres (93 mi) south of Tripoli Libyan culture is, to a certain extent, similar to that of its other Arab neighbour states and the Libyan people very much consider themselves as part of a wider Arab community. The primary language is a colloquial form of Arabic that is unique to the area around Libya. There seem to be two distinct dialects and a couple of village and tribal dialects. Libyan Arabs have a heritage in the traditions of the nomadic Bedouin and associate themselves with a particular Bedouin tribe. Family life is important for Libyan families. Most Libyans live in apartment blocks and various kinds of independent housing units depending on their income status. Most of the Arabs who have lived a nomadic lifestyle, traditionally in tents, have been settled into various towns and cities in Libya, their old way of life fading out. It is believed that there are still some who do live as they have for centuries in the desert, though no one knows their exact numbers. Most of the population are engaged in occupations in industry and services and a small percentage in agriculture. Similar to some other countries in the Arab world, Libya can boast few theatres or art galleries. Public entertainment is almost non-existent even in the big cities. Most Libyans instead enjoy regular trips to the many beaches of the country. They also visit Libya's many beautifully preserved archeological sites, especially that of Leptis Magna which is widely considered to be one of the best preserved Roman archeological sites in the world. The nation's capital Tripoli boasts a number of museums and archives including the National Archives, the Government Library, the Ethnographic Museum, the Archaeological Museum, the Epigraphy Museum and the Islamic Museum. The Jamahirirya museum, built in consultation with UNESCO is possibly the country's most famous and houses one of the finest collections of classical art in the Mediterranean. There has recently been something of a revival of the arts in Libya, especially in the field of painting and private galleries are springing up to provide a showcase for new talent. Conversely, for many years there have been no public theatres and only a few cinemas showing foreign films. The tradition of folk culture is still alive and well, with troupes performing music and dance at frequent festivals, both in Libya and abroad. The main output of Libyan Television is devoted to showing various styles of traditional Libyan music. Traditional Tuareg music and dance are popular in Ghadames and the south. * Music of Libya Morocco Morocco is a country of multi-ethnic groups with a culture and civilization. Through Moroccan history, Morocco hosted many people coming from both East Arabs), South (Africans) and Moors and Jews). All those civilizations have had some impact on the social structure of Morocco. It conceived all forms of beliefs, from paganism, Judaism, Christianity to Islam. Each region possesses its own elements, contributing, thus, to the making of national culture and to the civilization legacy. Morocco has set among its top priorities the protection of its legacy and the preservation of its cultural identity. Ethnically and culturally speaking, Mauritania nowadays can be considered the least Arabic among Arab countries. Most of its population are of mixed Berber and indigenous African origins. * Cuisine of Morocco * List of writers from Morocco * Music of Morocco Sudan *Music of Sudan *List of writers from Sudan *Islam in Sudan Largest Christian denominations are the Roman Catholic Church, the Episcopal Church of the Sudan, the Presbyterian Church in the Sudan and the Coptic Orthodox Church. Tunisia See also: * Islam in Tunisia * Music of Tunisia * Tunisian Arabic Western Sahara The major ethnic group in the Western Sahara is the Sahrawis, a nomadic or bedouin tribal or ethnic group, speaking the ·∏§assƒÅnƒ´ya dialect of Arabic, which is also the majority dialect in Mauritania. They are of mixed Arab-Berber descent, but claim descent from the Beni Hassan, a Yemeni tribe supposed to have migrated across the desert in the 11th century. Generally indistinguishable from the Hassaniya speaking tribes of neighboring Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria, Western Saharan Sahrawi people differ from their neighbors largely due to their exposure to Spanish colonial domination. All the surrounding territories were during the late 19th and early 20th century period of European colonial rule were generally under French colonial rule. Like other neighboring Saharan bedouin and Hassaniya groups, the Sahrawis are Muslims of the Sunni sect and the Maliki law school. Local religious custom 'urf is, like other Saharan groups, heavily influenced by pre-Islamic Berber and African practises, and differs substantially from urban practises. For example, Sahrawi Islam has traditionally functioned without mosques in the normal sense of the word, in an adaptation to nomadic life. The originally clan- and tribe-based society underwent a massive social change in the process of the imposition of colonial rule and subsequent upheaval in 1975, when a part of the population was fled into exile rather than pass under Moroccan rule, and settled in the refugee camps of Tindouf, Algeria, splitting up families, clans and tribes over allegiance or opposition to the imposition of Moroccan rule. For developments among this population, see Sahrawi and Tindouf Province. Subsequent to taking effective control of the territory, the Moroccan government considerably invested in the social and economic development of the Western Sahara under its control, with special emphasis on education, modernisation and infrastructure as part of efforts to win over the population. El-Aaiun in particular has been the target of heavy government investment, and has grown rapidly. Several thousands Sahrawis study in Moroccan universities. Literacy rates are estimated at some 50% of the population. Polisario claims the refugee population in Tindouf has a literacy rate in the 90's, which would be above the verified literacy rate in the host country Algeria, recorded at roughly 86%. To date, there have been few thorough studies of the culture due in part to the political situation. Some language and culture studies, mainly by French researchers, have been performed on Sahrawi communities in northern Mauritania.

In the late 1960s, he joined with Ronald Bell (later Khalis Bayyan), Robert \\"Kool\\" Bell, George Brown, Dennis Thomas and Robert \\"Spike\\" Mickens to become Kool & the Gang. His cool jazz stylings and octave runs, reminiscent of Wes Montgomery but uniquely his own, enriched the music of the group. His playing on the hit \\"Summer Madness\\" is a fine example of his work. Kool & the Gang blended jazz, funk, R&B;, and pop. The group remained popular from the 1960s through the 1980s. Smith stopped touring in January 2006 due to illness.

Pleasant, South Carolina, United States. The school serves students living in Mount Pleasant and other suburban portions of eastern Charleston County. Established in 1973, the school was re-built in 2004 to accommodate the town's rapid growth during the 1990s. History Wando High School takes its name from the nearby Wando River, a major tributary of the Cooper River that divides Charleston and Mount Pleasant. The school opened in 1973 shortly after desegregation was completed in Charleston County. In 2004, the new facility at 1000 Warrior Way in Mount Pleasant opened its doors. In 2009, principal Lucy Beckham was named the 2010 MetLife/National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) National Secondary Principal of the Year. This is classified as the highest honor in the nation for a secondary school principal.Smalley, Elliot Lucy Beckham Named Secondary Principal of the Year. ccsdschools.org (2008-12-15). In 2014, Beckham stepped down from her role as principal, and was replaced by interim principal Sherry Eppelscheimer. After the new campus was completed, the old campus became a temporary home for other local schools while they rebuilt their primary campuses. First it became the home to Laing Middle School, and in 2010 Charleston County leased part of the property to Buist Academy. When Buist completed its new downtown campus, its place on the old campus was taken by Jennie Moore Elementary. This arrangement continued until the 2014-2015 school year, for which both Laing and Jennie Moore moved into their new facilities a few miles away. Demolition of the old campus was completed in the fall of 2016. Today, the only remnant of the old campus is the football stadium, which was used by the Wando football team until the new stadium opened at the school in fall 2018.

Mitchell (2000) A History of Leeds Phillimore, West Sussex, The place-name Holbeck is first attested in the 12th century in forms such as Holebec and Holesbec, from hol 'a hollow' and beck 'a stream' (an Old Norse loanword, from bekkr, reflecting Scandinavian influence in Yorkshire during the Viking Age), thus 'stream in the hollow'.A. H. Smith, The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, English Place-Names Society, 30‚Äì37, 8 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961‚Äì63), III 216. The old manor belonged to the priory of the Holy Trinity at York and after the Dissolution of the Monasteries passed to the Darcy and Ingram families. In the 18th century Holbeck was still a village outside Leeds, and expanded with the development of hand weaving. At this time, Holbeck was known for its spa water, which resembled that of Harrogate, and was carried into Leeds for sale. The supply diminished when numerous wells were sunk to supply the mills and works in the area and the water, which previously rose to the surface, could only be obtained by pumping from a considerable depth. =19th century= In the first half of the 19th century, Holbeck village was a hamlet of few streets. Most were owned by John Scholey (1774‚Äì1834) and are listed in his will at the Borthwick Institute for Archives, University of York. His family sold the properties at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. It 'was still listed as a separate out-township as late as 1878, and was routinely cited without reference to Leeds'. But as the area industrialised around the mid-19th century, it became increasingly integrated into Leeds. There were ironworks, works for the manufacture of steam engines and machinery of all kinds. Key factories were: * John Marshall's Mill (begun 1791‚Äì92, spinning flax and thread). Marshall's Mill consisted of a spacious room lit by skylights, occupying an area of nearly two acres. * Matthew Murray's Round Foundry on Water Lane (1795‚Äì97) was where the Middleton Railway's first steam locomotives were built. * Starting in 1812, the factory in Silver Street belonging to Taylor, Wordsworth and Co, machine makers, eventually grew to cover three acres. * Tower Works, a pin-factory built in 1864‚Äì66 by Colonel Thomas Harding, with two Italianate towers added 1899 (Giotto Tower) and 1919 (plain Tuscan). In the mid-19th century Holbeck was one of the most densely populated suburbs of Leeds, described in 1834 as 'one of the most crowded, one of the most filthy, one of the most unpleasant, and one of the most unhealthy villages in the county of York'. Slum clearance took place after the cholera epidemics of 1832 and 1849. Holbeck railway station (now demolished) was built during the century. It was notable because it was a two-tier station with a low line and a high line; the railway viaduct, built in 1869, was thought to be one of the engineering marvels of the Victorian age. In 1877, the Holbeck Working Men's Club opened, one of the first in the country.John Baron, 'Regulars rally to save UK's oldest working men's club', The Guardian (31 May 2013). =20th century= Holbeck has suffered significant decline since the 19th century; in 1921, its population was around 38,152, but in 2010 was 4,470. Further slum clearance took place in the 1930s, and a workhouse, built by around 1870, was at this time converted into a hostel for the destitute, before being demolished in the 1970s and replaced with a school. Many of the industrial buildings and warehouses have been demolished or fallen into disrepair. Holbeck is nevertheless home to 33 listed buildings and many other important architectural structures. Some of the most notable of these are: The Dark Arches, the Hol Beck, Marshall's Mill, the Midland Mills, the Round Foundry, Temple Works, Tower Works and two railway roundhouses. The last active church in the area (until the recent establishment of new ones) was St. Matthew's, built in 1829‚Äì30 and deconsecrated in 1981. The railway station has been demolished, but plans began to be developed in 2014 to convert the track bed (which is currently overgrown with trees and shrubs) into a raised walkway leading directly into Leeds city centre. In the 1960s, Leeds sought to become a 'motorway city', and 1972‚Äì75 saw the completion of the M621, which runs through Holbeck, and the A643, creating a new boundary on Holbeck's west side. From 1956 to 2004 Kays Catalogues was the largest employer in Holbeck, acquiring Samuel Driver Ltd in 1956 and taking over Temple Works on Marshall Street, expanding the site in the 1950s and again in 1981. Part of the Kay's premises is a listed building.Kays Heritage Group =Recent times= In 2003 Kays was bought by the Barclay Brothers, and within a year the Holbeck distribution centre had been closed down. The 1981 distribution centre was soon demolished, the 1952 building became derelict, and in December 2008 Temple Works suffered a structural failure. Hasib Hussain, the suicide bomber responsible for the Tavistock Square bus bombing in London on 7 July 2005, lived in Holbeck. Geography The name Holbeck derives its name from the brook on which it is situated. Since industrialisation the beck, a natural watercourse has been canalised with stone-set floor and stone walls. It is crossed by several bridges giving access from Water Lane. Holbeck is on the flood plain on the south side of the River Aire of which the Hol Beck is a tributary. It covers an area of about 553 acres. According to Simon Bradley, writing in 2016, > The boundaries of Holbeck have moved over time, but my interviewees broadly > agree on where it lies: bounded by Leeds City railway station and the River > Aire to the North; the M621 to the south; the east perimeter follows > Victoria Road, overlooked by Bridgewater Place (known locally as 'The > Dalek'); the west is defined by the A643 feeder road joining the M621 to > Armley Gyratory. For the interviewees, the north and south boundaries are > more debatable than the east and west. Confusingly, for example, Holbeck Cemetery, founded in the mid-1850s, is to the south of Holbeck, in Beeston.Cf. Regeneration The clearance of Runswick Place in preparation for demolition Over recent years efforts have been made to regenerate the Holbeck area. The most notable scheme is the Holbeck Urban Village, which is expected to attract investment of around ¬£800 million and create around 5,000 jobs. However, the area surrounding the 'Village' is deprived and run down. From 2007, Leeds City Council began vacating the back-to-back housing and in 2010 began demolition. The main area of demolition during the regeneration was the Jenkinson Estate. Many low-rise flat blocks were demolished and the remaining housing received new UPVC windows, new roofing & external covering. The land where the low-rise flat blocks were has been used for brand-new social housing including four-bedroom family homes to two-bedroom apartments. Three rows of back-to-back terraced homes on Brown Lane-West and Top Moor Side have been demolished and made way for some more social housing, built by Keepmoat. In July 2017, residents had noticed some of the council-owned back-to-back terraced homes are being renovated with new windows and roofing. Landmarks The Old Library, Holbeck. Holbeck Conservation Area includes several industrial archaeological sites and Listed buildings. Holbeck is unique in Leeds as an area where many early to mid 19th century industrial buildings survive in an unaltered group within the original street pattern. The buildings are utilitarian two or three-storey brick structures with some larger complexes such as Temple Mill and the brick terracotta towers of Tower Works. Railway viaducts cut through the area, notably that of the Leeds and Bradford Railway of 1846 and the London and North Western Railway's extension line of 1882. Holbeck Public Library is built in red brick and terracotta. The 1877 Holbeck Working Men's Club is the oldest surviving working men's club in the UK.John Baron, 'Regulars rally to save UK's oldest working men's club', The Guardian (31 May 2013). Religion The old chapel, dedicated to St. Catherine and recorded in ancient documents as existing in 809, was rebuilt on the same site in the early 18th century. It became inadequate for the rapidly increasing population at that time and was demolished in 1836. The church of St. Matthew was built on common land next to the old burial-ground. It cost ¬£3,786 and was a Commissioners' church built by the Parliamentary Commissioners and consecrated in 1832. It is built in the early English style. There were places of worship for Independents, Wesleyans and other denominations. Currently the groups that meet in Holbeck include the Holbeck Christian Fellowship and Mosaic Church, which is found on Sweet Street in a warehouse opposite the Commercial pub and has been in Holbeck since early 2008. Over the last few years several of Mosaic's Church attendees have moved into Holbeck. Amenities The area has lost amenities as part of the population exodus connected with the demolition of properties as part of the regeneration scheme. Kwik Save supermarket closed in 2005, leaving small independent convenience stores. The post office closed in 2008, but reopened in 2009. There is a bookmaker and several fast food takeaways. Managed approach to on-street prostitution In 2014 Leeds Council in conjunction with West Yorkshire Police trialled a managed approach to prostitution which allows for soliciting and purchasing of sex in a light industrial area in a bid to: * reduce the problems caused by street prostitution to residents, and businesses which currently suffer from such nuisance; * better engage with street sex workers to improve their safety and health, with a view to enabling them to exit this way of life * reduce the prevalence of street sex working. After a review in 2016 it was announced that this was to continue indefinitely.Yorkshire Evening Post 29 July 2016 \\"Exclusive: ‚ÄòLegal red light zone‚Äô here to stay in Leeds\\" The activities here are featured in the 2016‚Äì17 BBC documentary series Sex, Drugs & Murder: Life in the Red Light Zone.

UK's first High Occupancy Vehicle Lane A section of the A647 road Stanningley Road and Stanningley By-Pass became the UK's first High Occupancy Vehicle Lane in 1998. It began on a trial basis and was made permanent after proving successful. This part of the route between Leeds and Bradford experienced high levels of traffic congestion and there were few public transport priority measures. The council originally wanted to install a bus lane, but found that bus service frequencies were too low to justify it. The project was part of an EU research project called Increasing CAR Occupancy (ICARO). Its objectives were to increase car occupancy by encouraging car sharing and to demonstrate the feasibility of providing a lane for shared use by buses, other high occupancy vehicles, motorcycles and cycles.

He was most recently head coach of Greek Super League club AEL. Festa played as a defender for clubs such as Internazionale and Roma, but is best known for his spells at centre back for Middlesbrough and Cagliari.  Playing career  Born in Cagliari, Festa started his career at his hometown club Cagliari Calcio. After impressing at Cagliari he joined Inter Milan. In his first year at the club he only made 4 league starts for Inter, and was transferred to Serie A rivals A.S. Roma. His form for Roma then earned him a move back to Inter Milan where he became a regular starter for the club, however prior to joining Middlesbrough he lost his place in the team and found himself mainly as a substitute. In 1997, Festa joined Middlesbrough, being one of the first Italians to play in the Premier League. Festa arrived at Middlesbrough from Inter Milan in the midst of a relegation battle to add steel to the defence. Festa was the second Italian at the club with Middlesbrough also having Italian International Fabrizio Ravanelli at the club. Festa scored on an impressive winning debut against Sheffield Wednesday in January 1997. Festa had been an accomplished martial arts master, a junior Italian tennis champion and captain of the Army team when he did his national service. He had shrewd positional sense, was tough in the tackle, a dominating figure in the air and got forward on occasions to score the odd important goal. After scoring in the semi final against Chesterfield, a goal that could have been even more historic was ruled out when Festa's header in the 1997 FA Cup Final was deemed offside. That was one of three Wembley appearances he made in his first 18 months at the club. When many of Middlesbrough's players left following relegation, Festa stayed and helped win promotion back to the top flight. His performances earned him the Middlesbrough player of the year award in 1998. Festa was squeezed out by the arrivals of England internationals Gareth Southgate and Ugo Ehiogu but remained as a squad player. In his final season at Boro they again reached the FA Cup semi finals. This time they faced Arsenal. Festa came on as a substitute for the injured Ehiogu with the score poised at 0‚Äì0. However, he unfortunately scored an own goal which proved to be decisive, as Arsenal reached the final with a narrow 1‚Äì0 win. Other memorable moments for Festa include scoring a late equaliser in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Southampton despite his team being reduced to 9 men, and an equaliser against North East rivals Newcastle United. In 2002 Festa left for a short spell at Portsmouth, where he scored once against Bradford City and was part of the squad that won the Championship and gained promotion to the Premier League. In 2003, he returned to Sardinia, joining Cagliari and helping the rossoblu to win promotion to Serie A. In 2004, he joined then-Eccellenza side F.C. Nuorese Calcio, serving as team captain and leading the club to two consecutive promotions and an unsuccessful appearance in the Serie C2 campaign playoffs in his third season. He agreed to leave Nuorese by mutual consent on September 2007. He then signed for Tavolara of Serie D, coached by his former teammate Vittorio Pusceddu. Style of play Usually deployed as a central defender, Festa was known for his strength in the air, ability to organise the back-line, and his eye for goal as a defender, having scored at least once in every season of his career since the 1993‚Äì94 season. Coaching career = Assistant at Cagliari= On 14 April 2010, he was appointed as assistant to newly appointed head coach Giorgio Melis at his former club Cagliari. Later in the seasons 2010‚Äì11 and 2011‚Äì12 he has been the coach of Primavera in the same club. =Lumezzane head coach= On 14 June 2012 he was appointed the new head coach of Lumezzane in Lega Pro Prima Divisione. He left Lumezzane in March 2013 and was replaced as head coach by the Lumezzane captain Michele Marcolini. =Leeds United: Massimo Cellino takeover= On 1 February, it was rumoured that Festa was to sit in the dugout for Leeds United's game against Ipswich Town. On transfer deadline day 31 January 2014 he was tipped to replace Brian McDermott as new head coach of Leeds United, a decision which caused uproar amongst the club's fans. With McDermott being reinstated as manager on 1 February during the second half of the Huddersfield Town match, on 3 February 2014 McDermott revealed in his press conference that Gianluca Festa had changed the starting lineup on Friday 31 January for the fixture against Huddersfield Town, only for the team to then be changed back again to the original starting lineup on Saturday 1 February by McDermott's assistant manager Nigel Gibbs. Festa watched the game from the stands with Gibbs taking caretaker charge instead of Festa on Saturday lunchtime. McDermott also revealed that on 3 February that Festa was still present in training, however this time acting as a translator for new signing Andrea Tabanelli. Tabanelli was signed in between the window of McDermott's 'sacking' and his reinstatement. =Return to Cagliari= Following Zdenƒõk Zeman's resignation, Festa was appointed as the new head coach of relegation-threatened Serie A side Cagliari on 22 April 2015, returning to the club he both played for and served as assistant manager. Despite winning a number of matches Festa was unable to prevent Cagliari being relegated to Serie B, and the end of the season Festa left the club and was replaced by Massimo Rastelli as the head coach. =Como= On 1 November 2015, he was named new manager of Como in the Serie B. He was sacked on 13 March 2016 with the club bottom of the Serie B. =AEL= On 24 September 2018, he was named new manager of Larissa F.C. in the Super League Greece. During his time in Larissa, he managed to keep the team in the Super League in a difficult season, avoiding relegation. At the end of the season he decided to resign from the role of head coach.

The band was one of the key bands in the MRR/Gilman Street project. John Kiffmeyer (a.k.a. Al Sobrante), who later went on to play for Green Day, was the drummer for the band. The other members were Lenny Johnson (guitar), Martin Brohm (bass) and Jason Beebout (vocals), who went on to form Samiam. History The group recorded a 10-song 7‚Ä≥ EP titled Bedtime for Isocracy, released in 1988 through Lookout! Records (L005). The band was later featured on the Lookout! Records' compilation, The Thing That Ate Floyd. Additionally, Isocracy's EP tracks were re-released on (L293) Punk Rock 7‚Ä≥s Volume 1. During their active years from 1986 through 1988, Isocracy was known for their wild performances where anything could happen. According to the book written about the Gilman St. Project, Isocracy was one of the main bands who brought a new sense of positive anarchy to the punk scene. During this time in the mid-1980s hardcore punk was the dominant musical style in the scene. Isocracy's live shows included playing in laundromats and covering the audience with garbage and shredded paper. In this regard, Isocracy bridged hardcore punk with performance art.

As an original worksong it was sung in a variety of trades, including being used by the wool and later the wheat traders who worked the clipper ships between Australian ports and London. In adapted form, it is now a very popular song among folk music performers that is recorded by many artists and is present in many of today's song books.  History as a shanty  Information on the age, spread, and practical use of the shanty is relatively sparse. However, the evidence at hand does not suggest there is anything particularly or locally \\"Australian\\" about the song, contrary to how it has become popularly envisioned since the late 20th century. It was first noted by sea music author L.A. Smith, who collected it \\"from a coloured seaman at the [Sailors'] 'Home'\\" in London and published it in her 1888 collection, The Music of the Waters.Smith, Laura Alexandrine. The Music of the Waters. London: Kegan, Paul, Trench & Co. In the 1930s or 1940s, at Sailors' Snug Harbor, New York, shanty collector William Main Doerflinger recorded veteran sailor William Laurie of Greenock, Scotland, who began a career in sailing ships in the late 1870s. The one verse sung by Laurie was published, with tune, in Doerflinger's 1951 book.Doerflinger, William Main. Shantymen and Shantyboys: Songs of the Sailor and Lumberman. Macmillan: New York. The shanty is not mentioned again until the 1900s (decade). Patterson (1900) mentions a heaving chanty titled \\"Bound to Western Australia,\\"Patterson, J.E. \\"Sailors' Work Songs.\\" _Good Words_ 41(28) (June 1900): 391‚Äì397. and the veteran African-American sailor James H. Williams mentioned the song in a 1909 article.Williams, James H. \\"The Sailors' 'Chanties'.\\" The Independent (8 July 1909):76-83.Hatfield, James Taft. \\"Some Nineteenth Century Shanties.\\" Journal of American Folklore 59(232): 108‚Äì113. This shanty is not attested in writing again until Lydia Parrish's study of the music tradition of Georgia Sea Islanders, published in 1942.Parrish, Lydia. Slave Songs of the Georgia Sea Islands. New York: Creative Age Press. In 1946, J.T. Hatfield shared his recollections of a much earlier, 1886 voyage as a passenger traveling from Pensacola to Nice. During this voyage, Hatfield had noted the shanties sung by the crew, who were all Black men from Jamaica. This version, which includes both tune and text, includes the unusual phrase, \\"Hooray! You're a lanky!\\", which may have been a mishearing by Hatfield. Another remembered version comes in F.P. Harlow's Chanteying Aboard American Ships (1962), in which the author recalls shanties sung aboard the ship Akbar on a trip from Massachusetts to Melbourne, Australia in 1876. A crew mate \\"Dave\\" is said to have taught this to the crew while pumping at the windlass.Harlow, Frederick Pease. Chanteying Aboard American Ships. Barre, Mass.: Barre Publishing Co., 1962 As no references to the song put it any earlier than the mid-1870s, it may well be that the song was new at the time.  Work function and lyrical variations  Smith said it was a capstan chanty, as evidenced by the refrain which indicates, \\"Heave away! Heave away!\\" Parrish found that stevedores hauling heavy timber used the song with the chorus, \\"Haul away, I‚Äôm a rollin' king.\\" = Lyrics = Like most shanties of this type, \\"South Australia\\" was sung to a flexible combination of customary verses, floating verses from within the general chanty repertoire, and verses improvised in the moment or particular to individual singers. The song was of indefinite length, and created by supplying solo verses to a two-part refrain followed by a grand chorus. The following is a sample after Stan Hugill: > (solo) Oh South Australia is me home > (chorus) Heave away! Heave away! > (solo) South Australia is me home > (chorus) An' we're bound for South Australia. > : Heave away, heave away > : Oh heave away, you rolling king, > : We're bound for South Australia Solo verse couplets documented to have been sung to \\"South Australia\\" include the following from sailors of the 19th century. > I see my wife standing on the quay > The tears do start as she waves to me. I'll tell you the truth and I'll > tell you no lie; > If I don't love that girl I hope I may die. And now I'm bound for a foreign > strand, > With a bottle of whisky in my hand. I'll drink a glass to the foreign shore > And one to the girl that I adore.  As a popular song  In the 1940s, \\"South Australia\\" became popular as a camp song.Unknown. \\"The A.C.A. Meet of 1892.\\" Forest and Stream 39(10) (8 September 1892). Pg. 212. And by the second decade of the 20th century, it had been adopted by several college glee clubs.Associated Harvard Clubs. _Book of Songs_. Chicago: Lakeside Press, 1916. A slightly different version of the song was published by Doerflinger in 1951. English folk revival singer A.L. Lloyd recorded the song, without citing a source, on the 1957 album \\"Blow Boys Blow.\\" He used Doerflinger's melody and the phrase \\"hear me sing,\\" which are unique to that collection, which Lloyd used for other shanties he performed. The Clancy Brothers recorded the song in 1962, in a version similar to A.L. Lloyd's. Patrick Clancy, one of the Clancy Brothers, had edited Lloyd's \\"Blow Boys Blow\\" album, which was released by Tradition Records, a label that Clancy managed. The Clancy Brothers rendered Lloyd's phrase \\"lollop around Cape Horn\\" as the unintelligible \\"wallop around Cape Horn.\\" The Clancy Brothers' version is the most common one sung by folk music and shanty performers. The song has been recorded many times in both traditional and modern arrangements. A traditional Morris Dance of the same name is performed to the tune, from the style of Adderbury. = Traditional recordings = The Bushwhackers and Bullockies Bush Band ( Bushwackers Band) on \\" The Shearer's Dream\\" album, Picture Records 1974. *A.L.

Park City, as the ski resort and area is known, contains several training courses for the U.S. Ski Team, including slalom and giant slalom runs. During the 2002 Winter Olympics the resort hosted the snowboarding events and the men's and women's alpine giant slalom events. Opened in 1963, the resort has been a major tourist attraction for skiers from all over the United States, as well as a main employer for many of Park City's citizens. The resort was purchased by Vail Resorts in 2014 and combined the resort with neighboring Canyons Resort via an interconnect gondola to create the largest lift-served ski resort in the United States. During the ski season, most slopes and lifts are open from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. History The resort was opened on December 21, 1963 as Treasure Mountain by United Park City Mines. This company was the last surviving mining corporation in Park City, and the resort was opened with funds from a federal government program meant to revive the economically depressed town. When it originally opened, it boasted the longest gondola in the United States, as well as a double chairlift, a J-bar lift, base and summit lodges, and a nine- hole golf course. The gondola was a four-passenger Polig-Heckel-Bleichert (PHB, a German aerial ropeway company). Its sister lift was built at Sugarloaf/USA in Carrabassett Valley, Maine, after top members of Sugarloaf's management visited Park City's lift. When the slopes first opened to the public, a special Skier's Subway was used to transport skiers nearly into the mountain through the pitch-black Spiro Tunnel on a mine train, where skiers then boarded a mining elevator that lifted them to the surface, and from there they had access to the entire mountain.The Milwaukee Journal - Skiing facilities grow with skiers - 1965-01-10 - p.7 Aerial trams once used for hauling ore were converted into chairlifts. To this day, there are still more than of old silver-mine workings and tunnels beneath the slopes at Park City Mountain Resort and its neighboring resort, Deer Valley. Treasure Mountain's name was changed to the Park City Ski Area for its fourth season of 1966-67, and in 1996, became known as the Park City Mountain Resort. The resort had grown to include eight peaks and nine bowls, with of skiing and 16 chairlifts. The resort has also developed summer activities including an alpine slide, alpine coaster, zip-lines, and several hiking and biking trails. A sister ski area, originally known as Park City West and later as Canyons Resort, opened in 1968. Deer Valley Resort opened in December 1981, at the site of the former Snow Park (1946‚Äì69). =2002 Winter Olympics= Temporary spectator seating at the resort during the 2002 Winter Olympics During the 2002 games, the resort hosted the men's and women's giant slalom, men's and women's snowboarding parallel giant slalom, and both men's and women's snowboarding halfpipe events. The resort's Eagle Race Arena and Eagle Superpipe were used as the Olympics runs. Temporary stadiums were erected at the end of each run with spectator standing areas on each side, creating a combined capacity of 16,500 persons. Almost all available tickets for events at the resort were sold 99.8 percent to a total of 95,991 spectators. During the games, 96 percent of the resort was open for normal seasonal operations, making it the only venue to allow spectators to leave and reenter. =2012 Litigation= In March 2012, Powdr Corporation (owners of Park City Mountain Resort) announced that it had filed a lawsuit against Talisker Land Holdings, LLC (Talisker), the owner of Canyons Resort, as well as United Park City Mines Company, both partial land owners of the resort. The lawsuit filed by Powdr Corp. was in response to an eviction notice issue by Talisker, the entity that owns most of the land the ski runs are on, who had been leasing it to Powdr Corp. (a continuation of the lease made between Park City Mines and Powdr Corp. when Talisker bought the land from Park City Mines). Powdr Corp. claimed that they had initiated talks with Talisker to extend their lease to 2051, and that Talisker had refused to agree to the terms and threatened to close the resort. In response, Talisker claimed that Powdr Corp. had failed to agree to the new terms set down by Talisker, and that they have never threatened to close the resort. Powdr Corp. sued Talisker for $7,000,000 for compensatory and punitive damages for the threat of the closure of the resort. Park City Mountain Resort had leased the land on which its ski runs are located for $155,000 per year, with an option to renew the lease for 20 years. In 2011, when this option came due, Powdr Corp. failed to renew the lease in a timely manner and sent a letter two days after the lease had expired. Eight months later, Powdr Corp. received a letter from Talisker that their lease had expired and they were to turn over the land and its improvements to Talisker. In 2013, Talisker leased Canyons Resort to Vail Resorts who then took over the legal action. Near the end of May 2013, an eviction notice was served on PCMR to vacate the leased land of the ski area. (). On September 11, 2014, Vail Resorts announced that it had purchased Park City Mountain Resort for $182.5 million, and that it would combine the resort with neighboring Canyons Resort over the summer of 2015 for the 2015-16 season. =Park City Mountain Resort under Vail Resorts= When the purchase was finalized, Vail added Park City Mountain Resort to its EPIC season pass program for the 2014-15 season. In 2015, the merger of PCMR with Canyons was undertaken by Doppelmayr USA as part of a project that built two new lifts and relocated a third. A new gondola called Quicksilver was built between the bottom of the Silverlode Express lift at PCMR and a point below the top of Iron Mountain at Canyons. The King Con Express high speed quad was upgraded to a high speed six pack, while the original King Con lift was relocated to replace the Motherlode triple chairlift. The upgrades on the PCMR side were done to alleviate expected congestion at Silverlode and King Con from the added interconnect gondola. The former Canyons Resort base area was renamed the Canyons Village at Park City and the entire combined resort now operates under the Park City Mountain Resort name. Park City mountain resort is home to many ski schools run by the mountain, but is also home to privately owned ski schools. In 2017, the various individual clubs came together to form one organization - Park City Ski & Snowboard Club. For the 2018 season, Doppelmayr constructed a high speed quad to replace the High Meadow lift at Red Pine Lodge. For the 2019 season, a fixed grip quad was constructed running from the bottom of Tombstone to a point just above the top of Sunrise, providing quick egress from the Tombstone and Iron Mountain pods to the Canyons Village base area by alleviating the need to take Tombstone back to Red Pine Lodge.

They have issued six albums, Higher Up the Firetrails (1995), Fear of Girls (1996), Patient (1999), Revenge Is Slow (2002), Come Across (2003) and Doubt Seeds (2006). History Bluebottle Kiss were formed in Sydney in 1993 as a grunge trio by Ben Fletcher on bass guitar and vocals, Jamie Hutchings on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Peter Noble on drums. Their influences are from the late 1980s United States indie scene, which include Sonic Youth and the Afghan Whigs, singer-songwriters of the 1970s, Neil Young and Van Morrison, as well as the Australian independent scene with the Church and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. The band were signed to Murmur, an imprint of Sony Music Australia. Their debut studio album, Higher Up the Firetrails, was issued in April 1995. It was recorded at the Bondi Pavilion Theatre with Wayne Connolly producing (Underground Lovers, You Am I). Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt they did not use a regular studio setting \\"in order to capture a certain ambience. The album ran the gamut of sounds from quiet dirge to chaotic noise.\\" They supported shows by Beck, JSBX, Crow and Silverchair. For the group's second album, Fear of Girls (August 1996), they used US producer, Jack Endino (Nirvana, Mudhoney, Afghan Whigs). McFarlane opined \\"[it] covered a lot of ground, from tough, noisy art-rock to bleak ballads.\\" Late in 1997 Noble was replaced on drums by Richard Coneliano. Although dropped from Murmur after the release of Somnambulist Homesick Blues in 1997, Bluebottle Kiss continued to make records on their own with various indie imprints. In 1998, Tap Dancing on the Titanic was issued on the now-dormant Troy Horse label.Australian Music Online :: Labels :: Troy Horse/MDS In 1999, Patient was released on Citadel Records, whose catalogue includes New Christs, Died Pretty, The Stems and more recently Knievel.Australian Music Online :: Labels :: Citadel Records The band briefly moved to the US after this before regrouping as revamped four piece in 2001. In 2002, a long-time music fan, Nick Carr - inspired by labels such as Citadel - started his own label, Nonzero Records, in order to release Bluebottle Kiss' Revenge is Slow album. The album was also released in the US on the In Music We Trust label.In Music We Trust Records In November of that year, Triple J's Richard Kingsmill presented a music special, \\"Bluebottle Kiss\\", for their J Files series to showcase the band's output. The relationship between Bluebottle Kiss and Nonzero Records has endured, with the band's sixth studio album - the 2 CD Doubt Seeds - being their third album, among numerous singles and EPs, on the label. Doubt Seeds was produced by Jamie Hutchings at Linear Recording studio in Sydney.

Life  Verdon was a son of the Rev. Edward Verdon, he was born in Bury, Lancashire, England 1834 and was educated at Rossall School. In 1851 he emigrated to Melbourne Australia. Obtaining a position in the office of Grice Sumner and Company he afterwards went into business at Williamstown, and began his public career as a member of the local municipal council. He was chairman of a conference of municipal delegates and soon afterwards published in 1858 a pamphlet on The Present and Future of Municipal Government in Victoria. He was elected a member of the legislative assembly for Williamstown in 1859, and in November 1860 joined the Heales ministry as treasurer. He resigned from the ministry in November 1861 but in June 1863 became treasurer in the McCulloch ministry which remained in office until May 1868. During the parliamentary recess in 1866 Verdon was sent to England to bring the question of the defences of Victoria before the English authorities. He succeeded in obtaining ¬£100,000 towards the cost of a warship, the Cerberus, and the Nelson was given to Victoria as a training-ship. Verdon also floated a loan for public works, and obtained sanction for the establishment of a branch of the Royal Mint at Melbourne. After his return he suggested the advisability of the colony having a representative in London, and in 1868 the office of agent-general was created, and Verdon was appointed to the position for a period of four years. He made a most favourable impression in London, he had been given the companionship of the bath in 1866, and in 1872 he was created K.C.M.G. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1870. On his giving up the agent-generalship he accepted the position of colonial inspector and general manager of the English Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank, Melbourne. In 1874 Verdon purchased 18 acres of land that had been reserved by the Victorian colonial government for the construction of a country house for the Governor near the top of Mount Macedon. He named the property Alton, after Alton Tower in England and after enlarging the property through purchase of neighbouring holdings, Alton House, a large Venetian Gothic mansion and stately gardens was designed and constructed under his direction. He was interested in science, art and literature, as a young man he had been an honorary assistant in the Melbourne observatory, and when treasurer he saw that it was properly equipped; he collected objects of art, and became a trustee of the public library, museums and national gallery of Victoria in 1872, was elected vice-president in 1880, and president in 1883.

The band consists of Pollard (vocals and lyrics), Todd Tobias (music and production), and Tim Tobias (music). Circus Devils employs a wide spectrum of musical styles ranging from acid rock to ambient soundscapes. On the band's web site, the music is described as \\"garage-prog, or \\"art rock made by cave men.\\"  History  Circus Devils was originally conceived in 2001 as a side project to Robert Pollard's main work with Guided by Voices. Between 2001 and 2017, the band released fourteen full-length albums. Beginning with the release of their first album, Ringworm Interiors, Circus Devils dismissed the styles of Pollard's other musical endeavors for a more experimental approach, taking an ominous and nightmarish tone, exploring the themes of good and evil. According to the group's whimsical website bio, Circus Devils formed because a dog-faced man approached each member on separate occasions to deliver the message, \\"Circus Devils is Real.\\" Like this story, the song lyrics are often unsettling fictional tales of horror delivered within deconstructed rock operas.[ AllMusic.com] Each Circus Devils album is distinguished by a theme, concept, or production style which sets it apart from the band's other albums.

He originated two major US library collections in the history of science and technology. Background Dibner was born in Lisianka, near Kiev, Ukraine in 1897. His family was Jewish.Paul Avrich, The Modern School Movement: Anarchism and Education in the United States, Princeton University Press (2014), p. 291 He moved to the United States with his family at the age of 7. In 1921, he graduated from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn with a degree in Electrical Engineering. Career Soon after graduating, Dibner designed and patented the first solderless electrical connectors and founded the Burndy Engineering Company in 1924. The company later became the Burndy Corporation and was bought by the French corporation Framatome Connectors International (FCI) in 1988. In 2009, Burndy was acquired and became a subsidiary of Hubbell Incorporated. Dibner died at his home in Wilton, Connecticut on January 6, 1988. The \\"Burndy\\" appellation, used for both his company and the library he would found, was invented by Dibner himself and represents a portmanteau or blend of his first and last names. In 1954, Dibner was a board member of the American Jewish League Against Communism. Historical research and libraries In addition to electrical engineering, Dibner studied the history of technology. He was an avid collector of original scientific works and of books on the history of science, as well as thousands of portraits of various scientists. Bern Dibner also wrote a great number of books on the history of science, such as The Atlantic Cable in 1955. In 1976 he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society. Dibner, who was fascinated by both art and technology, found great pleasure in studying Leonardo da Vinci. This interest led him to obtain a small library of works about da Vinci which grew over the years as Dibner's interests expanded into the history of electricity, the history of Renaissance technology, and finally the history of science and technology in general. His collection continued to grow, and in 1941 he formally set up the Burndy Library as a separate institution \\"to advance scholarship in the history of science.\\" By 1964, the Burndy Library collection totaled over 40,000 volumes and Dibner opened a new building in Norwalk, Connecticut, to house the Library. In 1974, Bern Dibner donated one-quarter of the Burndy Library's then holdings to the Smithsonian Institution to form the nucleus of a research library in the history of science and technology, to be located in the decade-old National Museum of History and Technology (now called The National Museum of American History: Kenneth E. Behring Center). In 1976, the Smithsonian's Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology was established, providing the Smithsonian Institution Libraries with its first rare book collection, containing many of the major works dating from the fifteenth to the early nineteenth centuries in the history of science and technology including engineering, transportation, chemistry, mathematics, physics, electricity and astronomy. The Smithsonian Dibner Library, then numbering 35,000 volumes, was reopened after construction in spring 2010, and is located in the National Museum of American History on the National Mall in Washington DC. The Smithsonian Institution Libraries have cataloged the books and manuscripts of the Dibner Library and entered the records into the international database OCLC and the Smithsonian's own online catalog, SIRIS. After Bern Dibner's death in 1988, the Burndy Library moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1992, where it became the research library for the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In November 2006, the complete Burndy Library collection, by then consisting of 67,000 rare volumes and a collection of scientific instruments, was donated to and became part of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, where it is available to scholars. The Huntington Library now offers a Dibner History of Science Program to fund fellowships, a lecture series and annual conference.

Here he was arrested by communist Ministry of Public Security. Antoni Heda (11 October 1916 ‚Äì 15 February 2008) was a Polish military commander and a notable veteran of the Polish resistance movement in World War II and later independence movement against Soviet occupation following the war. Among the best known of his partisan actions was the raid on Communist prison in Kielce in August 1945, in which roughly 300 political prisoners were freed. His codename was \\"Szary\\" (Grey). Early life and activities at the beginning of the Second World War  Antoni Heda was born in 1916 in the village of Ma≈Çomierzyce near I≈Ç≈ºa to a local peasant family. After graduating from a local primary school he moved to Radom, where he finished a Technical School and started a job in Starachowice Arms Works. Drafted into the Polish Army in 1937, he was dispatched to the Reserve Officer School (Szko≈Ça PodchorƒÖ≈ºych Rezerwy). Shortly before the outbreak of World War II he was demobilized and started working for the State Arms Works at Starachowice. Mobilized prior to the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War of 1939, Heda fought in the ranks of the Polish 12th Infantry Division in the area of his home town of I≈Ç≈ºa and then in the area of Lublin. After his division was disbanded he was trying to find his way to Hungary, but was arrested by the Soviet NKVD and imprisoned in the Brze≈õƒá Fortress. After the outbreak of a Nazi-Soviet war when the prison was taken over by the Germans, he managed to escape from the prison camp. Underground activities during the Second World War Heda returned to his home area and joined the ranks of the Society of Armed Struggle (ZWZ), the first mass-scale resistance organization formed in Poland. Named the commander of the Dolina area (in the Holy Cross Mountains), he became a notable resistance leader after his raid on the Gestapo prison in Starachowice. Out of 80 political prisoners liberated from there, 60 decided to join the resistance and thus Heda formed a permanent partisan unit stationed in the forests of the area. He then joined the partisan unit of Jan Piwnik Ponury, one of the most successful partisan commanders of World War II. He took part in a variety of actions against the Germans in occupied Poland. Among the best known are: * Raid on the German prison in I≈Ç≈ºa on 6 August 1943 * Disarming of a 45 men strong unit of the Wehrmacht stationed in Pakos≈Çaw near I≈Ç≈ºa on 15 September that year * Action against the village of Gozdawa near Sienno, which had been cleansed of their Polish inhabitants and then settled with Germans; the action took place on September 23 * March 1944 assault on the Starachowice Arms Works, in which the partisans dressed in German uniforms secured the entire factory, seized its treasury and secured several hundred pieces of arms * Battle of Jeleniec of 1 April 1944, in which the partisans managed to defeat a considerable German force that was trying to ambush them * Raid on Ko≈Ñskie on 5 and 6 June 1944, in which the partisans secured the entire city and set free the prisoners of a local prison. During Operation Tempest Heda's unit was attached to the 2nd battalion of the Polish 3rd Legions' Infantry Regiment under Capt. Stanis≈Çaw Porƒôba ≈öwiƒÖtek and took part in battles of Radoszyce, Trawniki and Szewce.  Anti-Soviet resistance  After the Soviet-backed Polish communist takeover of Poland, Heda - as a former prisoner of the NKVD - had to remain in hiding and joined the Ruch Oporu Armii Krajowej, one of splinter organizations formed after the Home Army had been disbanded. Later on he joined NIE and then yet another resistance organization Freedom and Independence (WiN). As a leader of a separate unit, Heda led yet another assault on a prison, this time on a MBP and Smersh prison in Kielce overnight of 4 August 1945. As a result, the partisans managed to liberate several hundred political prisoners, mostly former members of the Home Army. Heda was using a false identity (Antoni Wi≈õniewski) but the UB security forces managed to discover Heda's identity and arrested his family. Soon afterwards two of his brothers and his brother-in-law were tortured to death. Heda planned to organize a similar assault on the infamous Rakowiecka prison in Warsaw, but he was arrested by the forces of the Internal Security Corps in 1948 in Gdynia near the Gdynia Chylonia railway station. Imprisoned at Rakowiecka and later in Rawicz and Wronki, Heda was sentenced to death on 7 consecutive charges, but his sentence was later changed to life imprisonment. After the end of Stalinist period in 1956 he was pardoned and set free. He continued to collaborate with various groups opposed to the Communist regime in Poland and was also an active member of unofficial veterans associations. In 1980 he joined the Solidarity and the following year he was chosen as the chairman of the Independent Veteran Association of the Solidarity, the first veteran association not controlled by the Communist authorities. However, soon afterwards he had been interned after the 1981 imposition of martial Law in Poland. After Poland managed to get back its independence from the Eastern Bloc, in 1990 Heda returned to service as a leader of one of veteran associations uniting veterans of all fronts of World War II. He also became the honorary commander of the Riflemen Union, a paramilitary youth organization. He participated in Polish political life. In 1997 he spoke against adoption of a new Polish Constitution (created by post-Communist Democratic Left Alliance) by saying: \\"is against the Polish nation, it is for atheists and communistic masons.\\" On 3 May 2006 he was promoted to the rank of genera≈Ç brygady (he received the nomination in 2004 and accepted it in 2006). For his service he also received the highest of Polish military awards, Virtuti Militari (4th and 5th class), as well as the Cross of Valour (Krzy≈º Walecznych) and other decorations. He described his life in two books: Wspomnienia Szarego (Szary's Memoires) and Szary przeciw zdrajcom Polski (Szary against traitors of Poland). General Antoni Heda died in Warsaw on 15 February 2008. His funeral took place on 21 February 2008, starting with a Funeral Mass at the Field Cathedral of the Polish Army celebrated by Fr. Bishop Maj-Gen. Tadeusz P≈Çoskiego. President Lech Kaczynski posthumously awarded him the Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta, \\"for outstanding contribution to the independence of the Polish Republic\\".

Named in honor of George Washington Carver, the facility has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2005. History The small, wood-frame building was constructed in 1926 on the corner of Ninth and Guadalupe Streets. When it was replaced by a larger stone structure in 1933, the building was moved to the east side of town, on Angelina Street, to serve the African-American Community. It was known for many years as the \\"Colored Branch.\\" In 1947, the building was renamed the George Washington Carver Library in honor of the famous inventor and scientist. The library served African-Americans and others in the community until 1979, when a new, modern library building was completed next door. At that time work began to convert the building to a cultural center. The museum opened on October 24, 1980 and was expanded with a new facility in 2001. The original colonial revival style building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.  Juneteenth Memorial Monument  The Juneteenth Exhibit is the core of the George Washington Carver Museum, Cultural, and Genealogy Center's permanent exhibits. The displays and information provided help visitors understand the significance of freedom to formerly enslaved African Americans. Multimedia presentations introduce students to the earliest and present day Juneteenth celebrations. It also provides the opportunity to learn about Texas‚Äô participation in the Civil War, history of the celebration, why the holiday is significant for all Americans, as well as contrasting and comparing early commemorations and modern day activities. The Juneteenth Memorial Sculpture Monument opened to the public June 27, 2015. It is made up of 5 bronze figures that represent the story of Juneteeth and a paved timeline of the Black Presence in the Americas‚Äîfrom the Middle Passage to the Emancipation Proclamation that leads to the Bell of Freedom. The Juneteenth Sculptures are created by Adrienne Rison Isom and Eddie Dixon. Isom, a native Austinite, created 3 of the sculpture pieces‚ÄîFreed Man & Freed Woman, and Child (the girl figure). And Dixon created the remaining work‚ÄîLaw Maker and Pastor. The sculptures show how the news of freedom spread. Juneteenth began on June 19, 1865 with an order read by General Gordon Grainger‚Äîa law that the Emancipation Proclamation was enforced. So Legislature learned of freedom first, then the news reached The Pastor (who represents the faith leader in African American Community). The Pastor told the enslaved people represented by the Freed Man and Freed Woman, and they shared the news with youth-the Child figure. The blank pedestal is where visitors can stand and be a part of the piece and continue the Juneteenth Story‚Äîto remember, to reflect, and to be inspired to share the emancipation story with others.Weaver, Faith.

Born in Brussels, Verbrugghen made his first appearance as a violinist when only eight years old, and was a successful student at the Brussels Conservatorium under Hubay and Ysa√øe, winning many prizes. He visited England with Ysa√øe in 1888, and in 1893 settled in Scotland as a member of the Scottish Orchestra. During the summer he led the orchestra at Llandudno under Jules Riviere. For a time he was a member of the Lamoureux Orchestra at Paris and then for three years was deputy-conductor at Llandudno. He was director of music for four years at Colwyn Bay, and then returned to the Scottish Orchestra. In 1902 he became leader and deputy-conductor under Frederic Cowen, and during the promenade season led the Queen's Hall Orchestra for three years. In 1907, he was the soloist in the first performance in England of the Violin Concerto in D minor by Jean Sibelius.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954 He became chief violin professor at the Athenaeum, Glasgow, and in 1911 succeeded Dr Coward as conductor of the Glasgow Choral Union. In April 1914 he enhanced his growing reputation when a Beethoven Festival was held at London, Verbrugghen \\"conducting throughout the festival with insight and masterly ability\\" (The Musical Times, 1 June 1914, p. 399). Early in 1915 he was appointed director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium at a salary of ¬£1,250 a year. Verbrugghen arrived in Sydney in the same year full of enthusiasm. He had a great admiration for English-speaking people but did not like the methods of their schools of music, and decided that the conservatorium at Sydney should be based on continental models. He got together a remarkably fine orchestra, including the other members of his excellent string quartet who had come with him. For six years Verbrugghen's influence on the musical life of Sydney was of outstanding importance, but the politicians had not realized that it is impossible to carry on work of this nature without financial loss. The orchestra was disbanded in 1921 and Verbrugghen, who had suffered much from worry, went to America for health reasons. In 1922 he was a guest conductor of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, and had such a brilliant success that he was given the position of permanent conductor. Efforts were made in Australia to persuade him to return without success. In 1928, he was elected a national honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity, the American fraternity for men in music. In 1931 he collapsed at a rehearsal of his orchestra, and never completely recovered his health. From September 1933 he was chairman of the Department of Music at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota, and he died in 1934. There is a Verbrugghen Street in the suburb of Melba in the Australian national capital, Canberra. All the streets in the suburb are named after significant figures in Australian music. Verbrugghen Hall at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music in Sydney also commemorates his name.

Mathews (November 21, 1851 - April 17, 1898) was an American right- handed professional baseball pitcher who played in the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, the National League of Major League Baseball and the American Association for twenty years beginning in the late 1860s. He is credited as being one of the inventors of the spitball pitch, which was rediscovered or reintroduced to the major leagues after he died. He is also credited with the first legal pitch which broke away from the batter. He is listed at 5 feet 5 inches tall and 140 pounds, which is small for a pro athlete even in his time, when the average height of an American male in the mid-19th century was 5 foot 7. Career Mathews was born in 1851, in Baltimore, Maryland, and he played as a teenager with the Maryland club of that city, and he made the team a dangerous one. Mathews began his career at the age of 16 for the Marylands of Baltimore (a junior squad) in 1868. A year later, he moved to the senior club, and the following year the club declared themselves professional, resulting in the creation of the National Association of Base Ball Players (NAABP). On August 19, he made his first ever start in the league against the Orientals of New York, winning 28-15. https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/e7ad641f For the 1871 season, he and some other Maryland players signed with the Fort Wayne Kekiongas. On May 4, 1871 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, he pitched a shutout in the inaugural game of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NA), the first professional league. In his first season, he went 6-11 in 19 complete games and 169 innings, with a 5.17 ERA, 17 strikeouts and 21 walks. In the following season (now playing for the Baltimore Canaries), he rebounded with a 25-18 record in 49 games (while throwing 39 complete games) and 406 innings while having a 3.19 ERA, 52 walks and 57 strikeouts, the latter being a league high. He appeared as a batter in 19 games for 89 at-bats, batting .270 with 10 RBIs and a .612 OPS, with the latter two being career highs. Mathews went to the New York Mutuals alongside teammate Dick Higham after the season ended. In 1873, he played in 52 out of the 53 games the team played for the season (while throwing 47 complete games), going 29-23 with a 2.58 ERA in 443 innings with 62 walks (a career high) and 79 strikeouts, although the team finished 4th. One notable game was on July 3, when he allowed only two hits in a six inning rain-shortened game against Washington while scoring a run on a triple in a 2-1 win. However, research in recent years has alleged match-fixing over suspicious play during a game in the season. In a game on August 9, 1873, he was the losing pitcher in a 12-2 washout by the Brooklyn Atlantics in which they scored four runs to open up the game in the first inning. For 1874, he pitched in all 65 games of the season for the Mutuals (while throwing 62 complete games), throwing 578 innings while having a 42-22 record and a 1.90 ERA (a career low), 41 walks and 101 strikeouts, although the Mutuals finished 2nd place to the Boston Red Stockings. He also threw 32 wild pitches, a career high. On June 18, he pitched in a 38-1 victory over Chicago while allowing two hits in a game with severe wind conditions. A second accusation of match- fixing occurred in the season, as one player was seen in the company of a gambler in the area of Chicago on the August 5 home game, where the odds shifted towards Chicago. Mathews left in the fifth inning on a groin injury while leading 4-2, with John Hatfield serving to pitch the rest of the game and losing the game 5-4. After the game, it was revealed that Chicago had known the possibility of Mathews not playing due to a doctor's note the Mutuals produced certifying his play despite a warning. For 1875, he pitched in 70 out of 71 of New York's games (while having 69 complete matches) in the final year in the NA. However, he went 29-38 with a 2.49 ERA on 625.2 innings with 75 strikeouts and 20 walks. Additionally, he allowed career highs in hits (711), runs (421), and batters faced (2,759). He led the league in complete games, starts, and innings pitched. He appeared in a career high 70 games as a batter, making 264 at-bats and garnering 48 hits and 15 RBIs for a .182 batting average and a .188 OBP. He threw a one-hitter on May 22 in a 4-0 win over Brooklyn in which he faced just 28 batters on no errors. Overall, he went 131-112 in the NA. with his wins being third most in the league behind Albert Spalding (205) and Dick McBride (149). He led the Association in career amount of strikeouts and strikeouts per nine innings. For 1876, he played in 56 out of 57 games for the Mutuals while going 21-34 with a 2.86 ERA with 55 complete games on 516 innings while having 37 strikeouts and 24 walks. During the season, he turned over a telegram that was sent from a gambler, with a sting being set up to try and lure more out of the gambler, with the results being published in the New York Herald to try and discourage any more game-fixings. In his three years with New York, he had went 100-83 with a 2.31 ERA on 1,646.2 innings, with 266 strikeouts. The dissolving of the Mutuals meant that Mathews joined the Cincinnati Reds for 1877. His season went terribly, going 3-12 in 15 games (13 complete) with a 4.04 ERA on 129.1 innings pitched with 9 strikeouts and 17 walks. After the season, he joined a team in Janesville in the League Alliance. For 1878, he bounced around between the independent Brooklyn Chelseas and Worcester (a member of the International Association). He was plagued by drunkenness, which led to him being expelled from the latter team in July, to the point where he was replaced by Bud Fowler. He went 8-12 before Worcester left the league. Along with other members, they played as the Baltimore Waverlys for a few games. On October 15, he signed with the Providence Grays, joining the club in June of the 1879 season. In 27 games played for the Grays (with 15 complete ones pitched), he went 12-6 with a 2.29 ERA on 189 innings pitched, throwing 90 strikeouts and 26 walks. He also earned a save during the season. He additionally played 21 games for the Grays as an outfielder, logging in 182 innings with 17 putouts, five assists, and seven errors with one double play turned on a .759 fielding percentage. On June 27, he hit a home run off Boston pitcher Tommy Bond, his only career home run. The Grays won the National League pennant that year, doing so by five games over the Boston Red Caps. After a short stint in the Pacific League with the San Francisco Stars, he signed back with Providence prior to the 1881 season. In 14 starts, he went 4-8 with a 3.17 ERA in 102.1 innings while allowing 21 walks and 28 strikeouts. He was released mid-way through the season due to problems with drinking that troubled the club. He joined Boston not long after, serving time as an outfielder in 18 games and a pitcher for five games, four in relief. He won the only game he started for the team. Ultimately, he threw just 23 innings while getting two saves, 11 walks and five strikeouts. For 1882, he participated in 34 games as a pitcher, going 19-15 with a 2.87 ERA, throwing 31 complete games in 285 innings with 153 strikeouts and 22 walks, with his strikeout total being the most in his career thus far. He joined the Philadelphia Athletics in the American Association the following year. He returned to form, going 30-13 with a 2.46 ERA in 44 games pitched while having 41 complete games with 381 innings pitched while walking 31 and striking out 203 batters. The team won the pennant that year over St. Louis by one game. He went 30-18 with a 3.32 ERA in 49 games the following year, throwing 430.2 innings with 286 strikeouts and 57 walks. The next year, he won 30 games again while losing only 17 in 48 starts with a 2.43 ERA on 422.1 innings pitched. He struck out 286 batters with 57 walks. He served as coach for the pitchers at the University of Pennsylvania in 1886 while playing with the Athletics. Arm trouble diminished his season, as he pitched in just 24 games while going 13-9 with a 3.96 ERA on 197.2 innings, with 93 strikeouts and 53 walks. 1887 was his final year in the leagues. He started it by holding out in the spring to get the money back that had been deducted the earlier year for ineffectiveness. They agreed to a deal that would give him a $2,650 salary, but his arm was diminished. His seven appearances as a pitcher were spread out over the season. He went 3-4 with a 6.67 ERA while throwing 58 innings and allowing 25 walks and nine strikeouts. In his final game on October 10, he pitched a 7-5 loss to the Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers. For 1888, his attempts to try and get back on the team failed, although he did serve as coach for the team's pitchers and played on the reserve squad. In his five years with the club, he had gone 106-61 with a 3.06 ERA while pitching 1,489.2 innings and garnering 877 strikeouts. After baseball Mathews umpired a few games between 1871 and 1888 and signed with the regular staff of the Players' League in 1890, returning to the AA in 1891. Legacy Over his 16-year career, he had 297 wins, 248 losses, 525 complete games, with a career earned run average of 2.86. He had 1,528 strikeouts compared with 532 walks. He won 20 games 8 times, including 42 in 1874 with the New York Mutuals of the National Association, and is the only player to win 50 games or to pitch 100 games in each of three major leagues. He is the 25th winningest pitcher in MLB history, yet has the 2nd highest number of wins for a pitcher not elected to the Hall of Fame and the most career innings pitched for a pitcher not elected to the Hall of Fame. He is also the pitcher with the highest number of wins without reaching 300. Although he was known primarily as a pitcher (doing so for 578 games), he also played games in other positions from time to time, playing 80 games in the outfield, nine as a third baseman and two as a shortstop. Death Mathews died in 1898 in Baltimore, at the age of 46, of paresis caused by syphilis, and is interred at New Cathedral Cemetery, also in Baltimore.

She is active in Guyanese public life as the President of the Guyanese Indian Heritage Association. Shah's first novel, A Silent Life (Peepal Tree, 2005), which won the 2007 Guyana Prize for Literature First Book Award, combines strong social themes in the context of memories of 20th-century Guyanese history from the point of view of Muslim women of South Asian extraction, with a narrative that explores mythic patterns through elements of the other-worldly. Her second novel, Weaving Water, (Cutting Edge Press, 2013), deals with Guyanese history in a comparable way, but from a Hindu point of view and with a more chronological treatment. In November 2009, Shah was chosen one of the \\"500 Most Influential Muslims in the World\\" in a publication by the Prince Al- waleed Bin Talaal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding of Georgetown University, Washington DC, in conjunction with the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre in Amman, Jordan. Recently, Shah has come under criticism for race baiting in Guyana's 2015 election. It was found that her editorials, published in various news outlets, were deeply laced with racist undertones and incited the violence of the country's perilous post-colonial voting history. Shah's racial separation theories and promotion through her literature brought on many critics, who declared her words \\"a reckless misuse of an esteemed platform\\". The introduction to the publication states that it \\"provides a window into the movers and shakers of the Muslim world. We have striven to highlight people who are influential as Muslims, that is, people whose influence is derived from their practice of Islam or from the fact that they are Muslim.

It shares many aspects with the RollerCoaster Tycoon series (a similar series of games with an identical premise) but with a more simplistic and child-friendly gameplay style. The voicework is provided by Justin Fletcher. Gameplay The opening scene begins with a message on the player's answering machine telling them that they have been chosen to be the Park Manager. The scene transfers to the Legoland Park, where Jonathan Ablebody, a member of staff at the Park, is sitting in the control room, announcing that Professor Voltage has built a new invention. The announcement simultaneously introduces the supporting characters: Bob Longtree the gardener, JP the mechanic, and Rosie the chef. Once the player arrives at the Park, they are shown through to a hall, with staff and visitors. A stage curtain is pulled back, and Professor Voltage introduces his new time machine. As the time machine gets stuck while rising through the stage floor, Jonathan comments that the machine will never work. But after a quick repair, Professor Voltage fires the time machine up, smoke billows and light blasts through the building, and the machine disappears. After a brief moment, the time machine reappears and stops spinning abruptly. As the battered building crumbles, the Professor stumbles off the machine and is hit on the head by his Duplicator Ray. He realizes that the park, which has been destroyed by the effects of his experiment, can be rebuilt and improved using his Duplicator Ray and time machine. Jonathan remarks that he hopes it will work out and welcomes the player once again into Legoland. = Story Mode = In Story Mode, the player must complete five tutorial levels to learn how to play, then must complete ten Miniland levels to rebuild the Park. As the player progresses through the game, cutscenes are shown, followed by new attractions to build. When the game is completed, the player is rewarded with a certificate that they can print out. Story Mode also features cutscenes that illustrate Professor Voltage's discovery of new buildings, rides, and park themes. = Free Play Mode = In Free Play Mode, the player can create their own Legoland park without any objectives or limitations on money or time, but can only use sets they have unlocked up to that point and with a limit on the number of rides, decorations, and restaurants that can be placed. Completing the game in Story Mode gives the player access to all unlockables in Free Play Mode. A screenshot of in game action Reception Legoland received favorable reviews, earning a score of 80.5% at rating site GameRankings.

It came out of a proposal by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, after World War I, as a compromise to French Marshal Ferdinand Foch's insistence for the French-German border to be pushed back to the Rhine. Foch felt that the new border would prevent another German invasion into France. (France had been invaded from across the Rhine five times within a century: in 1814, 1815, 1870, 1914 and 1918.)Shirer p145 Origins at Versailles Along with Foch, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau had demanded for Germany's western border to be fixed at the Rhine. Clemenceau relented when the Treaty of Guarantee was proposed, but Foch insisted that the French occupation of the Rhineland was crucial to halt future German aggression.Shirer p146 Lloyd George's proposal and Foch's protest Lloyd George suggested a compromise. If France relinquished its claims on the Rhine, the United Kingdom and the United States would guarantee the French border against future German aggression. Wilson agreed and treaties to that effect were drawn up. Foch had stated: \\"If we do not hold the Rhine permanently there is no neutralization, no disarmament, no written clause of any nature, which can prevent Germany from breaking out across it and gaining the upper hand. No aid could arrive in time from England or America to save France from complete defeat\\". Rejection In return for abandoning the Rhine, Clemenceau accepted solemn guarantees of his country's frontier from his two great allies. Both houses of the British Parliament approved the Treaty of Guarantee in July 1919 under the condition of its ratification by the United States. However, the US Senate refused to approve either it or the Treaty of Versailles, which nullified the British assent. Clemenceau had been promised that aid in return for giving up the security of the Rhine that his generals had demanded. It was believed that Germany would not have invaded France if it known by Germans that to the British and the Americans would oppose the invasion by military force.Shirer p146 The rejection made Clemenceau unpopular and so ended his political career.

A 2014 documentary from the NFL Network's A Football Life series profiles his career, as well as his \\"double life as a closeted gay man and a star athlete.\\" Professional career Selected in the ninth round (118th overall) of the 1965 NFL Draft out of Arizona State, Smith was also drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 18th round of the 1965 AFL Draft. https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/S/SmitJe01.htmSmith had a stellar career for the Redskins under head coaches Bill McPeak, Otto Graham, Vince Lombardi, and George Allen. He played in Super Bowl VII at the end of the 1972 season, and Sports Illustrated called him \\"an outstanding receiver among tight ends, with the ability to break open for a long gain.\\" Smith caught 421 passes, including 60 touchdowns, a career record for tight ends at the time. He was named All- Pro twice and held several NFL records that stood for years. In 2011, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Smith to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2011 In , as a part of a USO tour in association with the NFL, Smith, along with other stars John Brown, Butch Byrd, Fred Hoaglin, George Kunz, and Tom Woodeshick, visited and signed autographs for wounded military personnel in Vietnam. From 1967 to 1970, Smith was a full time starter for the Redskins. He missed several games in 1971 to injury, but was back as a full time starter the following season, and would be until his final season in 1977. During his career, Smith made several all-pro times.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SmitJe01.htm Death Smith died of AIDS at age 43 on October 15, 1986, at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Maryland. He was the first former professional athlete to die of the disease.NFL Documentary Profiles Closeted Gay Player Although he acknowledged that he had AIDS, he never publicly acknowledged he was gay. He was buried at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring. Head coach Vince Lombardi, who had a gay brother, demanded a homophobia-free locker room but \\"not even the legendary Lombardi could insulate him from the crippling societal homophobia of the era.\\" Smith's sexuality was confirmed after his death by former teammate pro NFL football player David Kopay, who had come out of the closet years earlier. The Redskins logo, along with Smith's uniform number 87, was part of the AIDS quilt. Some of Smith's teammates knew he was gay. Brig Owens, a defensive back for Washington at the time who also roomed with Smith, said Smith lived in fear, because if people knew he was gay, he'd be done in football. He said Smith was afraid that people would take away something that he loved. Owens was one of the players on the team that knew for sure Smith was gay. Dave Kopay was briefly a teammate of Smith's. Kopay came out of the closet in 1972, after his playing career ended. He also wrote an autobiography about having a relationship with a teammate. Even though Kopay used an alias, Smith knew Kopay was talking about him. After the autobiography came out, Smith never spoke to Kopay again.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2014/01/21/jerry- smith-redskins-nfl-films-network-a-football-life/4730903/ Of all of his teammates, Smith was closer to Owens than perhaps anyone else. Their bond was so tight, Owens' own daughters referred to Smith as 'Uncle Jerry'. Redskins center Len Hauss was another close friend to Smith as well. On one occasion, a player said a word Hauss did not like (most likely a gay slur) and Hauss confronted the player and said he'd better not hear that word in the locker room again. And that word was never spoken in the locker room ever again. https://www.si.com/vault/2016/02/11/he-was-one-us In 2014, The NFL network aired A Football Life: Jerry Smith. The hour long show was about Smith, his career, and his death from AIDS. Brig Owens was interviewed during commercial breaks. When asked if Smith belongs in the hall of fame, Owens replied that Smith would be in the hall already if he wasn't gay.

She was also a women's rights activist, journalist, educator, singer, novelist, and leader of the occult order, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.King 1989, page 41 She was a friend and collaborator of Nobel laureate William Butler Yeats, poet Ezra Pound, playwright Oscar Wilde, artists Aubrey Beardsley and Pamela Colman Smith, Masonic scholar Arthur Edward Waite, theatrical producer Annie Horniman, and many other literati of London's Fin de si√®cle era, and even by their standards she was \\"the bohemian's bohemian\\".Greer (1994) Though not as well known as some of her contemporaries and successors, Farr was a \\"First Wave\\" Feminist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries; she publicly advocated for suffrage, workplace equality, and equal protection under the law for women, writing a book and many articles in intellectual journals on the rights of \\"the modern woman\\". Early life Florence Beatrice Farr was born in Bickley, Kent, England (nowadays a suburb of London) in 1860, the youngest of the eight children of Mary Elizabeth Whittal and Dr. William Farr. She was named after nursing pioneer Florence Nightingale by her father, a physician and hygienist who was a friend and colleague of Nightingale's. Dr. Farr was known as an advocate of equal education and professional rights for women,University College of London bio who doubtlessly influenced his daughters' attitudes in their later lives. Burne-Jones Her family sent her to school at Cheltenham Ladies' College in 1873. One of her childhood friends was May Morris, the daughter of Jane Morris, the renowned Pre-Raphaelite artist's model, who introduced her to the artistic and intellectual circles of London society. Farr, May Morris and other friends posed for Sir Edward Burne- Jones' Pre-Raphaelite painting \\"The Golden Stairs\\" when she was 19 years old. The painting is exhibited at the Tate Gallery in London. From 1877 to 1880, Farr attended Queen's College, the first women's college in England. After leaving college, she took a teaching position, but soon her aspirations turned to theatre. Theatrical career Farr's first acting experience was in amateur productions with the Bedford Park Dramatics Club, in which her sister Henrietta and brother-in-law Henry were active members. Beginning in 1882, Farr served an eight-month apprenticeship under actor-manager J. L. Toole at Toole's Theatre in King William IV Street near Charing Cross. She adopted the stage name Mary Lester in deference to her father's wishes, who did not want the Farr name associated with the theatre. Her first professional stage appearance was as \\"Kate Renshaw\\", a schoolgirl, in Henry J. Byron's Uncle Dick‚Äôs Darling.Boisseau (2004) Folly Theatre In 1883 her father died, leaving her a modest inheritance to live on. She continued taking minor roles at the Folly, but changed her stage name back to Florence Farr when she began performing at the Gaiety Theatre in May. Her commanding presence and beautiful speaking voice were noted by George Bernard Shaw. She soon attained modest success on London's West End stages. In 1884 she married fellow actor Edward Emery. It turned out to be a disastrous marriage, and she chafed under the restrictions expected of a Victorian wife. In 1888, her husband left for an extended tour of America, and they never saw each other again. She eventually obtained a divorce in 1895 on the grounds of abandonment and never remarried. In early 1890, Farr moved in with her sister, Henrietta, and brother-in-law, painter and stage designer Henry Marriott Paget, to Bedford Park, a bohemian London enclave of intellectuals, artists and writers. Bedford Park was known for its \\"free thinkers\\" and the \\"New Woman\\"(a term coined by Sarah Grand), where women participated in discussions on politics, art, literature and philosophy on an equal basis with men.Johnson (1974) An early feminist, Farr was known for advocating equality for women in politics, employment, wages, etc., amongst her intellectual circle of acquaintances. Yeats also lived in Bedford Park, and it's likely she first made his acquaintance when her brother-in-law was painting Yeats' portrait. While in Bedford Park, Farr starred in the play A Sicilian Idyll: A Pastoral Play in Two Scenes by John Todhunter (an associate of Yeats and fellow member of the Golden Dawn) in the part of \\"Priestess Amaryllis\\", who summons the Goddess Selene to wreak revenge on her unfaithful lover. Shaw was in the audience to review the play, which he called \\"an hour's transparent Arcadian make-believe\\",Jayawardena (1995) but was greatly impressed with Farr's performance, as well as her \\"startling beauty, large expressive eyes, crescent eyebrows, and luminous smile.\\" Ibsen's Rosmersholm Shaw wished to mold her into his idealized vision of \\"The New Woman\\" and be the star of his plays. Shaw wrote that she reacted vehemently against Victorian sexual and domestic morality and was dauntless in publicly championing unpopular causes such as campaigning for the welfare of prostitutes. In a letter to Shaw she wrote, \\"‚Ä¶a race is likely to become degenerate so long as the sex question resolves itself ultimately into the question of how women can make the best bargain and, in so doing, deny themselves the liberty of free choice.\\"Litz (1996) For Yeats she was, like Maud Gonne, a poetic muse, whose resonate voice was perfect for reciting his poetry. He found in her \\"a tranquil beauty like that of Demeter's image near the British Museum reading-room door, and an incomparable sense of rhythm and a beautiful voice, the seeming natural expression of the image.\\"Peters (1980) In his review of A Sicilian Idyll, Yeats wrote, \\"Mrs. Edward Emery (Florence Farr) ‚Ä¶won universal praise with her striking beauty and subtle gesture and fine delivery of the verse. Indeed her acting was the feature of the whole performance that struck one most, after the verse itself. I do not know that I have any word too strong to express my admiration for its grace and power‚Ä¶I have never heard verse better spoken.\\" Both men wrote leading parts in their plays for Farr, who used her influence with Annie Horniman to have them produced. Farr was also the first woman in England to perform in Ibsen's plays, in particular the role of Rebecca West in the first English production of Rosmersholm, at the Vaudeville Theatre in 1891, which gained her critical acclaim. The character of Rebecca West is a 'New Woman' who rejects the ethical systems of Victorian Era Christianity, which for Florence Farr was a virtual typecast role. Producer and director In 1893, Horniman anonymously financed Farr's first venture as a director, a series of plays at the Avenue Theatre on the Embankment. She commissioned her friend, artist Aubrey Beardsley, to create the poster for the season. Farr had starred as Blanche, a slumlord's daughter, in Shaw's first play, Widowers' Houses, and she approached both Shaw and Yeats to write plays for her production at the Avenue. Yeats delivered the short play The Land of Heart‚Äôs Desire, but Shaw had not finished his play in time for the series opening. A Comedy of Sighs by John Todhunter was quickly substituted, with Farr in the leading role, but the play was badly received and the entire venture was nearly a disaster. Shaw's Arms and the Man After receiving a desperate cable from Farr, Shaw delivered his Arms and the Man. With only one week of rehearsal, Farr originated the supporting soubrette role of Louka, the vivacious and insolent servant girl who steals the affections of the hero from the play's lead ingenue, which Farr had conceded to the well-known actress Alma Murray. A bold satire of romantic idealism, the play was a great success with both audiences and critics, and still stands as one of Shaw's greatest works. But Farr was growing closer to Yeats (that they became lovers is speculated but not proven) and distancing herself from Shaw, so Arms was the last play by Shaw she ever performed in. Throughout the 1890s, Yeats used Farr's 'golden voice' as part of his quest to encourage the rebirth of spoken poetry. In 1898, in Yeats' The Countess Cathleen, she played Aleel, a bard and seer who could see into the spirit realm, and sang all of her lines in verse while accompanying herself on the psaltery. Farr became a regular contributor to the performance of Yeats' metrical plays, and in 1898 he made her the stage manager for his Irish Literary Theatre. But during that same period of her life Farr was sidetracked from her theatrical career, much to the chagrin of Shaw (\\"...and now you think to undo the work of all these years by a phrase and a shilling's worth of esoteric Egyptology,\\" he wrote her in 1896)Bax (1971) by her involvement with Yeats in the secret occult society The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Golden Dawn Farr as \\"Aleel\\" in Yeats' play The Countess Cathleen The Golden Dawn is based on an initiated lodge system similar to that of Freemasonry; however women are admitted on an equal basis with men. Farr was initiated into the Isis-Urania Temple of the Order of the Golden Dawn in London by Yeats in July 1890King 1978, page 24 taking the magical motto Sapientia Sapienti Dona Data (Latin: \\"Wisdom is a gift given to the wise\\"). Annie Horniman was also a member of Isis-Urania Temple, which led to Farr's theatrical collaborations with her and Yeats. Farr became Praemonstratrix of the temple in 1894,F.King, 1989, pages 51‚Äì52 taking charge of the educational system, and giving classes in tarot divination, scrying and Enochian magic. Spiritualism and Theosophy were very popular in the late Victorian Era, but unlike some of her contemporaries Farr practiced magic, including the classic mystical techniques of invocation and evocation.King, 1989, page 52 She published her first philosophical paper, A Short Inquiry concerning the Hermetic Art by a Lover of Philatethes in 1894 and wrote several of the Order's secret instruction papers, called the \\"Flying Rolls\\". With the resignation in 1897 of William Wynn Westcott, one of the co-founders of the Order, Farr replaced him as \\"Chief Adept in Anglia\\", becoming the leader of the English lodges, and the official representative of Samuel MacGregor- Mathers, the only remaining founder, who lived in Paris. By the end of 1899, personal disputes arose within the Golden Dawn, which Farr described as an 'astral jar' between other senior members (Adepts), and a secret society within the Isis-Urania Lodge called The Sphere Group, created by Farr in 1896.King, 1989, page 66 There were also factions within the Order that resented a woman having authority as Chief Adept. Farr eventually believed that the temple should be closed down,King 1989 page 67 writing to Mathers in January 1900 and offering her resignation as his representative,Wilson, page 54 but that she was willing to carry on until a successor was found. Mathers' reply shocked and amazed her, for it claimed that Westcott had committed fraud and forged some of the foundational documents and charters of the Order. After waiting a few days she consulted with Yeats, and they jointly wrote to Westcott requesting an explanation of, and a reply to, Mathers' charges.King 1989 page 68 Westcott denied the charges, and a seven-member committee of Adepts was formed to further investigate Mathers, asking for proof. Mathers sent a belligerent reply, refusing to produce proof, asserting his authority and dismissing Farr from her position as his representative on 23 March.King 1989 page 69 The Adepts in London continued their investigation, and subsequently expelled Mathers in 1901. Farr, Yeats and Horniman (who returned after having been expelled earlier by Mathers) attempted to reorganize the Order, but met with limited success. Farr remained in her Chief Adept position for a time, but resigned in January 1902 in the wake of a fraud scandal concerning associates of Mathers that exposed the once secret society to public ridicule.Gilbert (1998) Later life Farr with her psaltery harp in 1903 After Farr severed her association with the Golden Dawn she joined the Theosophical Society of London, and went on to write and produce (with Olivia Shakespear) two Egyptian-themed plays, The Shrine of the Golden Hawk and The Beloved of Hathor. Farr was also involved in the performance, direction and musical composition of a number of plays for the Lyceum, Court and New Century Theatres in London, between 1902 and 1906. Besides collaborating with Yeats and his Abbey Theatre, Farr gave frequent performances of his poetry, which she set to the music of her psaltery. Farr toured in Great Britain, Europe and America in 1906 and 1907 to take the 'new art' of Irish literary theatre to wider audiences. While in America she met and collaborated with scenic painter and Tarot card artist Pamela Colman Smith, who worked as Farr's stage manager. Farr also wrote regular articles during this time, particularly about women's rights, theatre and ancient Egyptian religion, in the British journal of art and politics, The New Age, and for Theosophical journals, some of which have been anthologized into books. In her essay \\"Our Evil Stars\\" (New Age, October 1907), Farr writes that reformation of public health and marriage laws are not enough to liberate women. \\"We must kill the force in us that says we cannot become all we desire, for that force is our evil star that turns all opportunity into grotesque failure....So let us each recognise the truth that our first business is to change ourselves, and then we shall know how to change our circumstances.\\" Through the Theosophical Society she had met Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, a spiritual teacher and future member of the Tamil parliament in Ceylon. Farr was greatly impressed by his plans for the education of young women in his native country, and she committed herself to helping him when he was ready. In 1912, Farr learned that Ramanathan had established his Uduvil Ramanathan Girls College, and at the age of fifty-two, she sold all her possessions and moved to Ceylon, returning to her first vocation, that of a teacher. Farr was appointed Lady Principal by Ramanathan and the administration of the school was turned over to her. Certainly the organizational skills she learned as the Praemonstratrix of the Golden Dawn served Farr in her new position, and due to her tolerance and respect for the Tamil traditions, the school thrived under her administration. Farr also kept up her correspondences with Yeats, and sent him her translations of Tamil poetry. Then in 1916, a lump in her breast was diagnosed as cancer, and she underwent a mastectomy. In Farr's final letter to Yeats, she included a humorous drawing of herself with her mastectomy scar, and wrote: \\"Last December I became an Amazon and my left breast and pectoral muscle were removed. Now my left side is a beautiful slab of flesh adorned with a handsome fern pattern made by a cut and 30 stitches.\\" But the cancer had spread, and Florence Farr died a few months later at the age of 56 in a hospital in Colombo, in April 1917. In accordance with her wishes, her body was cremated and the ashes scattered by Ramanathan in the sacred Kalyaani River. Yeats In his poem \\"All Souls' Night\\", Yeats wrote: > \\"On Florence Emery I call the next, > Who finding the first wrinkles on a face > Admired and beautiful, > And by the foreknowledge of the future vexed; > Diminished beauty, multiplied commonplace; > Preferred to teach a school > Away from neighbor or friend, > Among dark skins, permit foul years to wear > Hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end.\\"Yeats, The Collected Poems Works        References =Footnotes= =Bibliography=      External links * *Florence Farr's papers at Senate House Library, University of London *Excerpts from M.K.

The basic allegations are that Lewis, by virtue of his chairmanship of the House Appropriations Committee (since January 2005), and his prior chairmanship of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, was able, through earmarks and other methods, to steer hundreds of millions of dollars to clients of Lowery's firm. Lowery and his firm have earned millions of dollars in fees from these clients. Lowery and others in his firm, in turn, have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Lewis' campaign committee and political action committee. Defense contractors who are clients of the lobbying firm have also given hundreds of thousands of dollars. Lewis, who has not faced serious opposition in his re- election campaigns in the past ten years, has used his campaign and PAC funds in support of other Republicans, something that helped him become chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. The Justice department ultimately dropped its investigation into the firm and Mr. Lewis. A spokesman for the department had no further comment. In addition, two key individuals on Lewis' staff (Letitia White and Jeff Shockey) went to work for Copeland Lowery, earning millions of dollars for themselves; Richard White, Letitia's husband, has seen a steep increase in his income since he switched to being a lobbyist for defense firms; Lewis' stepdaughter has benefited from his ties to the lobbyists; and Jeff Shockey, upon returning to work of Lewis in 2005, was paid two million dollars by Copeland Lowery as \\"severance\\", based upon projected revenues of the lobbying firm for the eleven months following his departure.  Federal investigation  No individual has been formally charged with any wrongdoing, but there is now an ongoing federal investigation being run by the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles, and a federal grand jury in Los Angeles has issued at least 10 subpoenas. As of early July 2006, one of Lowery's two ex-wives, Melinda Morrin, has been interviewed twice by the FBI about her ex- husband's dealings.Eric Werner, \\"Lawmaker-turned-lobbyist at center of 'earmarking' probe\\" , Associated Press, July 15, 2006 On June 1, 2006, the San Bernardino Sun reported that the City of Redlands, California and San Bernardino County, California, both clients of Lowery's law firm, had been subpoenaed in the federal investigation into possible lobbying and earmarking abuses by Lowery's firm and Lewis.Guy McCarthy, \\"FBI eyes county records; Sources: Feds probe lobbyist tied to Lewis\\" , San Bernardino County Sun, June 1, 2006 Four days later it was revealed that two other clients of the law firm, California State University San Bernardino and Riverside County, California, had also been subpoenaed.John Bresnahan, \\"Subpoenas Indicate Lewis Probe Is Heating Up\\", Roll Call, June 5, 2006 On June 6, three more California cities, Loma Linda, Yucca Valley, and Twentynine Palms stated that they had been issued subpoenas.George Watson and Andrew Silva, \\"Subpoenas revealed: 2 more cities asked to give documents related to Lewis\\", San Bernardino County Sun, June 6, 2006Guy McCarthy and Andrew Silva, \\"Yucca Valley tied to Lewis Inquiry\\" , San Bernardino County Sun, June 6, 2006 On June 14, Highland, California announced it had been issued a subpoena.George Watson, \\"Highland's turn in Lewis inquiry\\" , San Bernardino County Sun, June 15, 2006 On June 28, 2006, an official of ESRI said that the company had also received a federal subpoena as part the ongoing investigation into the ties between Lewis and Copeland Lowery. \\"We have no concerns,\\" ESRI spokesman Don Berry said. \\"We retain a lobbyist and it is not an issue for us.\\"Duane W.

Birnbaum, \\"Lobby Firm Disbands Because of Investigation: Some Partners Have Ties to Rep. Lewis\\", Washington Post, June 17, 2006 *Since 1993, Lewis and Lowery have celebrated birthdays together, vacationed together and often shared meals at restaurants near their Capitol Hill homes. Lewis was the best man at Lowery's second marriage. Lowery emceed a gala for Lewis in Redlands, California in 2004. Their day-to-day contacts are made convenient by Lowery's special access to Capitol Hill. As a former congressman, he can exercise at the House gym and walk onto the House floor. *In January 1995, Lewis became chairman of the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations subcommittee. =Lewis moves up; staff moves out (and back)= *In January 1999, Lewis became chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees more discretionary spending than any other congressional subcommittee. That year, Jeff Shockey, who had worked for Lewis since 1991Paul Kiel, \\"Revolving Door Staffer Paid Big Money by Prior Clients\\" , TPMMuckracker.com, June 12, 2006 left Lewis' employ to join Copeland Lowery, where he would work for the next six years.Timothy J.

(She eventually left Lewis' staff to start a family.) *In 2000, Richard White, the husband, of Letitia White, a key Lewis staffer, stopped lobbying for the Brown & Williamson tobacco company and registered to do defense lobbying. *On January 8, 2003, Letitia White, who had worked for Lewis for 21 years, including as chief of staff, and was known as his \\"gatekeeper\\",Zachary Coile, \\"New Move to Trim Political Pork: Congress considers fresh limits on 'earmarks' -- pet projects usually benefit legislator's home state\\", San Francisco Chronicle, February 15, 2006 left Lewis' employ, and government service.

He received approximately $2 million from Copeland Lowery as a \\"separation/buy-out agreement\\" (see below). After Shockey left Copeland Lowery, the firm changed its name (removing \\"Shockey\\"), with White becoming a name partner in the firm.Paul Kane, \\"Lewis, Calvert Records Eyed: FBI Also Looks at Aides' Filings\\" , Roll Call, June 8, 2006 * Lewis said White is so dedicated to public service that she also asked to rejoin his staff when he became chair of the appropriations committee. But according to Lewis, he said no, because he wanted White, whose husband is in his early 70's, to build some financial security. \\"I said, 'Letitia, I'm afraid you shouldn't do that,'\\" Lewis said. * In February 2005, Alexandra Shockey was hired as a subcontractor by Copeland Lowery, taking over some of her husband's clients. Other clients went to White. * In February 2005, Julia Willis-Leon, one of Lewis' stepdaughters, became head of a newly registered political action committee, Small Biz Tech PAC. The PAC address was a townhouse half-owned by Letitia White and her husband. During the first 17 months of the PAC's existence, 40% of the $114,000 in revenues for the PAC came the Whites and from small defense contractors represented by Copeland Lowery. =The end of Copeland Lowery; the federal investigation begins= * On December 23, 2005, the San Diego Union Tribune published a lengthy article on Lewis, Lowery, the Whites, and the Shockeys. * In late May 2006, the FBI sent a special agent from its office in Riverside, California, to the Cannon House Office Building to retrieve documents as federal prosecutors in Southern California were issuing a series of subpoenas to towns and counties in Lewis' Congressional district, all of which were represented at one time or another in lobbying activities by a current or former Lewis staffer. (See above for details.) The FBI obtained financial disclosure forms from 1999 through 2004 for both Lewis and his wife, Arlene Willis, who is chief of staff for Lewis in his personal office. * In late May or early June 2006, Lewis hired a high-profile legal team from a Los Angeles-based law firm. The team includes former Solicitor General Ted Olson; Robert Bonner, who once led the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles and was once head of Customs and Border Protection; Mel Levine, a former Democratic congressman from California; and Joseph Warin, a former federal prosecutor.Erica Werner, \\"Lewis Hires Legal Team Amid Investigation\\", AP, June 13, 2006 * In June 2006, Copeland Lowery amended 35 prior government filings which reported the firm's lobbying revenues and clients between 1998 and 2005.

Republicans Lowery, Denton and White formed a firm called Innovative Federal Strategies. * In early July, a spokesman said that \\"The firm is continuing to review its lobbying disclosure forms,\\" and that \\"The firm is planning to amend the 2003 and 2004 statements involving [San Bernardino County] in the coming days,\\" with underreported income in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.David Baumann, \\"Lobbying: Thousands Missing From Copeland Lowery Income Reports\\", National Journal, July 7, 2006 * By October 2006, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission, Lewis had spent about $800,000 of his campaign funds for lawyers.Paul Kiel, \\"CA Rep Drops Nearly $800,000 on Legal Fees\\" , TPMMuckraker.com, October 18, 2006  The earmarks  After Lewis became chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee in 1999, earmarks in defense bills exploded. \\"We used to think that Mr. Lewis would be a champion for smart spending,\\" said Keith Ashdown of the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. \\"But he brought us the biggest increase in defense earmarking in history.\\" A study by that group found that Lowery's clients have had a remarkable success rate before Lewis' committee. \\"Hundreds of millions of dollars have gone to this one firm's clients,\\" says Ashdown.Aram Roston, Lisa Myers & the NBC Investigative Unit, \\"House Appropriations chairman under fire: Did Rep. Jerry Lewis use his powerful position to enrich a friend?\\", MSNBC, June 7, 2006 Such earmarks are normally done openly. For example, on November 8, 2005, Lewis' office sent out a press release by email announcing that the congressman had secured $10.75 million in federal funding for a number of recipients, including at least five that are clients of Copeland Lowery.Ken Silverstein, \\"House for Sale: more on Letitia White and Trident Systems\\", Harper's Magazine, June 9, 2006 Lewis has helped secure more than $1 billion for projects across Inland Southern California in recent years. Lewis has aided more than 250 Inland projects with allocations ranging from $81,000 to help move the Big Bear Zoo to nearly $100 million to ESRI, a Redlands mapping company working on reconstruction plans in Iraq. Federal funding has paid for flood-control and transportation projects, community services, and advanced technology for area businesses and agencies. Lewis is credited with bringing tens of millions of federal dollars for cancer research in Loma Linda and helping reverse factors that led to unprecedented fire danger in the San Bernardino National Forest.Ben Goad and Duane W. Gang, \\"Lewis inquiry raises fears for future funds\\", the Press-Enterprise, June 26, 2006 = Brent Wilkes = During the 1995-2005 period, some of the two dozen firms in San Diego and Virginia owned by Brent R. Wilkes received about $100 million in federal contracts. Most of Wilkes' government work came from earmarks.Peter Pae and Dan Morain, \\"Cozying Up to Power\\", Los Angeles Times, May 8, 2006 In November 2005, Wilkes was described as \\"co-conspirator No. 1\\" in a plea agreement signed by Representative Randy Cunningham, a California Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. In the plea deal, Cunningham admitted accepting more than $2.4 million in cash and gifts from Wilkes and other contractors.David Johnson and David D. Kirkpatrick, \\"Washington Deal Maker Details Palm Greasing\\", August 6, 2006 Since 1993, Lewis has received $88,000 in contributions from Wilkes and his associates. Lewis has subsequently given $56,000 of that to Habitat for Humanity.Claire Vitucci, Michelle DeArmond, and Richard K. De Atley, \\"Lewis denies knowing of ethics investigation\\" , Press- Enterprise, May 12, 2006 Wilkes paid Lowery's firm $160,000 in fees, according to original filings by Copeland Lowery.George Watson and Andrew Edwards, \\"Lewis denies report that he was being investigated\\" , Redlands Daily Facts, May 12, 2006 In fact, those fees were substantially underreported: the firm's fees had increased to $25,000 a month by 2005, and total fees were underreported by at least $225,000. In an August 2006 interview, Wilkes said he considered dropping the firm, but that Lowery threatened to block future projects if their relationship ended. Wilkes said Lowery had warned several times that doing so could prompt Lewis to cut off earmarks, saying, \\"You don't want me telling those guys on the committee that you are moving on without me.\\" That meant, Wilkes said, \\"I'd be out of business.\\" Wilkes described the system bluntly: \\"Lowery would always say, 'It is a two-part deal,'\\" he recalled. \\"'Jerry will make the request. Jerry will carry the vote. Jerry will have plenty of time for this. If you don't want to make the contributions, chair the fund-raising event, you will get left behind.'\\" Barbara Comstock, a spokeswoman for Lewis, said the congressman was unaware of any conversations like those Wilkes described having with Lowery. In 1998, Lewis traveled to the Poway, California, offices of one of those firms, ADCS, shortly before it received one of its first major government contracts. He met with executives and got a briefing on the company, which was formed a few years earlier and sought government contracts to convert paper records to electronic format, including a project in the Panama Canal Zone.Peter Pae, Tom Hamburger and Richard Simon, Powerful Lawmaker's Relative Linked Financially to Contractor Los Angeles Times, June 8, 2006 In February 1999, Wilkes met with Shockey, then a Lewis aide, to ask the Lewis's office to intervene on a project paid through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). On April 15, 1999, three months after Lewis was named chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee, he received $17,000 in campaign contributions from Wilkes and his associates.Jerry Kammer and Dean Calbreath, \\"Lewis subject of 'earmarks' investigation, source says\\", Copley News Service, May 5, 2006 Around that time, when a VA accounting officer complained about questions from a congressman on ADCS's behalf, a Wilkes aide, Mike Williams, wrote back that Lewis was \\"a close personal friend of Brent's.\\" The letter offered to \\"have the congressman's office contact the V.A. to put this issue to rest.\\" In early 2006, Lewis has said that he barely knew Wilkes and that he did not remember seeing him in nearly a decade. But Wilkes says their relationship was closer than that. Ever since they went on a scuba-diving trip together in 1993, he said, Lewis had referred to him as his \\"diving buddy.\\" They occasionally dined together or met at political functions, Wilkes said. At a Las Vegas fund- raiser in April 2005, Wilkes said, Lewis greeted him as \\"Brento\\" and hugged him as Wilkes surprised Lewis with $25,000 in campaign contributions. =Other companies that benefited from earmarks= The following are some of the other companies that paid Copeland Lowery for lobbying services and received earmarked government contracts. *Redlands-based mapping company Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). Between 2001 and 2006, Lewis earmarked more than $90 million for ESRI projects that included defense intelligence systems such as database mapping to assist in rebuilding war-torn Iraq. Work included such efforts as building software that assesses the fire danger of the San Bernardino Mountains, helping move troops in the Iraq war, and assisting in reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina. From 1998-2003, the company also received another $60 million in defense contracts outside of those earmarks. ESRI has paid Lowery's firm $320,000 since 1998. Jack Dangermond, the president and founder of ESRI, and his wife, Laura, have consistently been two of the top individual contributors to Lewis' campaign fund, giving a combined $13,900 between 2000 and 2005. The couple has donated a combined $32,900 to the campaign fund and Lewis' PAC since the 2000 election cycle. In late June, ESRI became \\"the first private company reported to be subpoenaed by investigators from the U.S Attorney's Office in Los Angeles.\\" On September 5, 2006, the Associated Press reported that federal investigators were looking into a donation of of land to the city of Redlands by the owners of ESRI in 2001, land adjacent to the home of Lewis. *Lewis fought for a decade on behalf of San Diego, California contractor General Atomics, forcing the Pentagon to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on GA's Predator UAV, which the generals didn't want. In return, General Atomics donated generously to Lewis' campaign and PAC, and hosted at least one fundraiser for Lewis. In April 2002, General Atomics paid for White and her husband to take a 10-day, all-expenses-paid trip to Italy,Bruce V. Bigelow and David Washburn, \\"Report: Trips buy 'access that you and I can't get'\\" , San Diego Union-Tribune, June 6, 2006 at a reported cost of nearly $8,500. In January 2003, White became a lobbyist for the company, one day after Lewis' employ. In May 2003, the company paid for Lewis and his wife to go on a trip to New York City. In the three years (2003‚Äì2005) after White became a lobbyist, GA paid Copeland Lowery over $300,000. General Atomics has given $15,000 to Lewis' campaign and PAC in recent years.Justin Rood, \\"Former GOP Aide's Ties Make Lewis Case Knottier\\" , TPMMuckracker.com, May 22, 2006 In October 2004, Lewis and now-convicted Representative Duke Cunningham, Representative Duncan Hunter, had a joint fund-raiser at the company's San Diego headquarters.Jerry Kammer, \\"Lobbying ties give campus funding edge: Alum helps San Bernardino get earmarks\\", Copley News Service, December 23, 2005 *Isothermal Systems and Tessera Technologies partnered on a defense project that received $4.5 million in earmarks over 2003 and 2004.

In the late 1990s, after it signed on with Lowery's firm, the company's growth curve turned sharply upward: sales went from about $10 million per year to $52 million in 2003, when it was sold. In April 1999, Lewis, Lowery, White, and White's husband traveled to San Diego at the company's expense; the purpose was a tour of the company's headquarters. The group stayed two nights at one of La Jolla's most prestigious resort hotels; Lewis' suite cost $700 a night. :Orincon paid $720,000 to Copeland Lowery between 1998 and 2003.Jerry Kammer, A close-knit circle of money, power: Contractor adds layer to Rep.

It was founded in 1985 but grew slowly until 2003. 2005 revenues were about $30 million; as of 2006, nearly 90 percent of the company's revenue came from federal contracts. Between 2002 and 2006 Trident received at least $23.6 million in defense-related earmarks inserted into appropriations bills that Lewis supervised. In April 2003, three months after White began representing the firm, $8.4 million for Trident was earmarked into an emergency spending bill for the Iraq war.Jerry Kammer and Marcus Stern, \\"PAC fund's ties to lawmaker at issue: Lewis' daughter runs it; critics say it's unethical\\", Copley News Service, June 8, 2006 In addition, Trident had been a beneficiary of Lewis-backed funds to support small-business contracts with the Defense Department: the company has received tens of millions in grants from the Small Business Innovation Research Program since 2002, including five in 2005 and at least one in 2006, for $9.62-million. :In the first three years that White represented Trident, her firm billed the company $340,000.Jerry Kammer and Marcus Stern, \\"Lobbyists' money flows to Rep.

One year later, the city reported that more than $6 million in federal funding had been dedicated to local interests, including San Timoteo Creek, the Redlands Trolley, a regional crime mapping and analysis project hosted by the police department, and the Redlands Community Center. The city has continued to pay the firm $30,000 per year.

Since 1998, Copeland Lowery has charged the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District $160,000 in fees. *The county museum of San Bernardino County received more than $1 million for a Hall of Paleontology and a heritage center. The county also got $50,000 earmarked for a wading pool. The county hired Copeland Lowery in late 2002Jeff Horwitz, \\"E-mails released in Lewis investigation: Writings include comment on lobbying firm's performance\\" , June 24, 2006 at the monthly rate of $12,500.

A number of projects were funded. *Since 2002, the San Diego State University Foundation and Loma Linda University have used a series of earmarks in the Department of Navy budget to form the Center for the Commercialization of Advanced Technology, which operates out of both schools and tries to find nonmilitary markets for new technologies. The foundation pays about $200,000 a year to Copeland Lowery for its lobbying services. *Lewis helped the University of Redlands secure $4 million for endangered species research, $7.5 million for Salton Sea research and $10 million for a new science center. The school named one of the buildings in the science center after Lewis. From 1999 through the end of 2005, the school paid Copeland Lowery $680,000 in lobbying fees. *The town of Yucca Valley has had a contract with Copeland Lowery since January 2003. The town initially paid $3,000 per month plus expenses; that was increased in August 2005 to $3,500. (The Center for Public Integrity shows \\"less than $10,000\\" in fees for both 2003 and 2004.; the difference was presumably part of the underreporting that was identified in June 2006.)

Lewis spokesman Jim Specht said the congressman has never recommended to anybody that they need a lobbyist to speak with him. \\"Many members of city councils, mayors and even city staff call our office all the time,\\" Specht said.  Benefits to Lewis  = Campaign contributions from lobbyists and their clients = For Lewis, the relationship with Lowery has eased the burden of fundraising, which he calls \\"the last thing I want to do with my time.\\" Many of Lowery's defense-contractor clients also contribute to Lewis as part of their lobbying strategy. In total, Lowery's lobbying firm and its clients contributed $480,000 to Lewis' political action committee in the 2000-2005 period, 37 percent of the $1.3 million raised by PAC during those six years. Since 1997, Lewis has received more than $917,000 from Copeland Lowery lobbyists and their for-profit clients. Lowery, his partners, and their spouses have contributed $135,000 to Lewis' campaigns and political action committee over the past decade, routinely giving the maximum allowed by law. Lowery also had organized and hosted Lewis fundraisers. *Since 2003, the Whites have given $30,000 to Lewis campaigns and his PAC. They also gave $40,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee and thousands more to PACs established to retain Republican control of the House. *Between 1999 and 2005, the Shockeys contributed more than $170,000 of their income to Republican causes, including $40,000 to Lewis. In all, between 1997 and 2005, Copeland Lowery's for-profit clients made $48.2 million in political contributions to nearly 1,300 federal candidates and committees. At least $6.2 million went to the campaigns and political action committees of House Appropriations Committee members, including Lewis. Slightly over $1 million of that $6.2 million went to the members' political action committees. Lewis' Future Leaders PAC got about $520,000 of that $1 million. It is legal for lobbyists to direct companies to make contributions, as long as they are not given in exchange for official, specific action by members of Congress. Campaign contributions used for re-election campaigns Lewis was originally elected to the U.S. House in 1978 with 61 percent of the vote. Between 1980 and 1998, he received at least 60 percent of the vote at each election.Profile of Jerry Lewis, CQ Press, 1999 Since the 1998 election, Lewis has collected more than three-quarters of million dollars in campaign funds in each two-year election cycle.

Lewis had $1.1 million in his campaign fund after the election. *In 2004 he again had no Democratic opponent in the general election. Campaign contributions used for other Republicans What the campaign contributions have done for Lewis is to provide him influence with other Republicans. Lewis said he lost his chairmanship of the Republican Conference, then the No. 3 post in the House Republican hierarchy, in January 1993 partially because of weak fundraising.Matt Kelley, \\"The Congressman & the Hedge Fund\\", USA Today, January 19, 2006 In the 2000 election cycle, Lewis gave $350,000 from his campaign and PAC to other candidates; 2000 Cycle: Candidate to Candidate Giving, opensecrets.com in the 2002 cycle he gave $475,000; 2002 Cycle: Candidate to Candidate Giving, opensecrets.com and in the 2004 cycle he gave $530,000. 2004 Cycle: Candidate to Candidate Giving, opensecrets.com These figures do not include money to party committees. 2004 Cycle: Spreading the Wealth, opensecrets.com For example, in 2004, Lewis's campaign had $1.56 million in total receipts, and he gave the Republican leadership $650,000 in excess campaign funds to help maintain Republican control of the House. Winning the position of Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee The money that Lewis gave to other Republicans was part of his successful effort to win their backing for his becoming chairman of the House Appropriations Committee in 2005. He acknowledges that fundraising \\"played a very significant role\\" in winning the post. In 2003 and 2004, Lewis, then chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee, was in a fierce competition for the chairmanship. The Republican leadership had begun assigning chairmanships in part based on how much campaign money a member had raised for other members. Mr. Lewis and his rivals for the post, Representatives Ralph Regula of Ohio and Harold Rogers of Kentucky, each began a fund-raising blitz. And each concentrated on the industry that had benefited from spending appropriated by their subcommittee, which in Mr. Lewis's case was defense. White, at Copeland Lowery, organized a steady stream of fund-raisers for Lewis and other Republicans. \\"We'd get e-mails from her asking us to go to her events about once a week,\\" an in-house lobbyist for a major defense firm recalled. \\"We all kind of laughed about it. But everyone in town noticed how active she was.\\" Lewis raised more than $800,000 for his political action committee in the 2004 election cycle and got the chairmanship, although Regula was more senior.David D. Kirkpatrick, \\"Rise of Lobbyist Shines a Light on House Ties\\", New York Times, June 3, 2006 Lewis called his selection be Chairman \\"the highlight of my career in public affairs\\", and said: > We have a historic opportunity and a unique responsibility to reform the > appropriations process and change the culture of the committee. I intend to > lead a committee that is dedicated to fiscal restraint and committed to > being an integral part of our Republican leadership's effort to rein in > spending and balance the federal budget.\\"Congressman Jerry Lewis speaks out > regarding Chairmanship of Appropriations\\", Thursday, January 6, 2005 = Improved neighborhood = On September 5, 2006, the Associated Press reported that federal investigators were looking into a donation of of land to the city of Redlands by Jack Dangermond, the president and founder of ESRI, and his wife, Laura. The land, worth more than $2 million, was donated in September 2001, about six months after the Dangermonds bought it. The donation required the city to agree to keep the property as open space or parkland. The land, some of which sits directly across from Lewis' home, is part of a scenic canyon in one of Redlands' wealthiest neighborhoods. Keeping the land free of development helps ensure property values remain high. ESRI had hired Copeland Lowery in 2000, the year before the purchase and donation. In 2002, the year after the donation, the defense appropriations subcommittee, which Lewis chaired, provided a $15 million earmark for the National Imagery and Mapping Agency to acquire software from ESRI. The Dangermonds said in a statement that they didn't know Lewis lived in the neighborhood when they decided to buy the land and donate it. A spokeswoman for Lewis' attorneys said the congressman was unaware the Dangermonds owned the land and did not know the terms under which it was given to the city. =Lewis' stepdaughter= Julia Willis-Leon is the daughter of Arlene Willis, who is Lewis' wife and his chief of staff. Before they were married, Arlene Willis was her husband's top aide when he came to Capitol Hill in 1979.\\"It's all in the family as lawmakers hire\\", AP, April 15, 2006. Lewis and Willis have four children of their own and three children from prior marriages; Julia Willis-Leon is one of those three.  Small Biz Tech PAC  Willis-Leon is the director of the Small Biz Tech PAC. The PAC took in about $113,700 between February 2005, when it registered, and June 2006. Of that, more than $42,000 was used to pay the salary and expenses of Willis-Leon.Small Biz Tech PAC reported expenditures , fecwatch.org (Willis-Leon has disputed the amount of her compensation ‚Äî which was calculated from government records by the Center for Responsive Politics, a political watchdog group ‚Äî but would not say what the correct amount was). Of the $113,700 in revenues, $46,000 came from Letitia White, her husband Richard, and small defense contractors represented by Copeland Lowery. In March 2005, the PAC sponsored a luncheon for Lewis As of June 2006, the PAC had given $15,600 to candidates or other PACs. The address that the PAC used when it registered in 2005, and the address listed on its website (as of early June 2006) is a three-story, million-dollar Capitol Hill townhouse. Willis- Leon said she works from her home in Las Vegas, that the PAC used the townhouse address only in its initial stages, and that it maintains no office there. FEC records indeed show that the Capitol Hill address was the organization address in their initial filing of February 3, 2005, and an amended filing later showed a different address. Nevertheless, a year later, the web site still showed the Capital Hill address The townhouse was purchased in December 2003 by Letitia White and one of White's clients, Trident Systems founder and president Nicholas Karangelen, and their spouses. Karangelen also has the position of chairman of the board of the PAC. Karangelen has described the house as an investment property. Friends of White say she sometimes stays in the town house and uses it for fund-raisers and events related to her lobbying business.David D. Kirkpatrick, \\"Lobbyist Says Client Paid Half of Town House's Cost\\", New York Times, June 7, 2006 Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for Copeland, Lowery, declined comment on the Small Biz Tech PAC and characterized the townhouse purchase as a private matter. \\"It was not connected in any way to any fee arrangement or any work for Trident,\\" he said.  \\"Strategic partner\\" of another lobbyist  Willis-Leon, who lives in Las Vegas, is a \\"strategic partner\\" of the lobbying firm of Potomac Partners DC LLC, President Richard Alcalde said in an interview in June 2006. Alcalde said he has paid Willis-Leon $40,000 to $50,000 over the last year for advice on several clients. Six of Alcalde's thirteen clients have business before the Appropriations Committee, according to reports of his lobbying activity.Charles R. Babcock, \\"Relative of Hill Panel Chairman Scrutinized\\", Washington Post, June 18, 2006 Work prior to the PAC and Potomac partners Willis-Leon's lawyer said that his client has a background in event planning and met Alcalde, as well as leaders of the Small Biz Tech PAC, through contacts that included Letitia White. The lawyer said that Willis-Leon had also worked part-time for General Atomics as well as for groups representing alternative fuel users and charter schools, before she met Alcalde. It is known that she was a wedding planner.  Benefits to the lobbyists  =The firm= From 1998 to 2004, the annual revenues of Copeland Lowery more than tripled, from $1.58 million to $5.11 million, according to the Center for Public Integrity. In 1998, the firm had 28 clients; as of December 2005, it had 101. In 2005, Copeland Lowery reported income of $7.4 million, ranking it one of Washington's top 50 lobbying firms. In the second half of 2005, it ranked number 32 nationwide. As of mid-2006, prior to its disbanding, the firm had five partners (James Copeland, Lowery, Lynn Jacquez, White, and Jean Denton) and 14 other employees. Copeland Lowery had no written partnership agreement and functioned under an \\"eat what you kill\\" arrangement. Its partners kept the revenue they collected from their clients less overhead costs, which were divided among them based on the percentage of total firm revenue that each of them brought in.Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, \\"$2 Million Payment to Former Lobbyist Raises Eyebrows\\", Washington Post, July 10, 2006 Overhead costs in 2004 were about 18 percent.David D. Kirkpatrick, \\"Lucrative Life in Revolving Door for Capitol Hill Staff Member and Lobbyist\\", New York Times, June 10, 2006 =Lowery= Lowery earned about $850,000 in 1997. In 2003, he earned just under $2 million. The growth of his firm made Lowery a very wealthy man. He now owns two homes - a townhouse on Capitol Hill and a property in King William County, Va. In 2003, Lowery received part of the proceeds of the sale of Orincon, a defense firm that was a client of Copeland Lowery, when that company was purchased by Lockheed Martin. Lowery had been on the board of directors of Orincon, and owned several thousand shares of the company's stock. =Letitia White= White, 48, joined Lewis' staff as a receptionist and rose to become his top aide on defense issues. White was able to begin lobbying Lewis' committee, and Lewis, in January 2003, immediately after she left his employ, despite a federal law that bars certain \\"senior staff\\" from such lobbying for one year after they leave. White's salary - $112,420 - was $80 less than the threshold of $112,500 (75 percent of a House members' salary, which was $150,000 at the time) that defined \\"senior staff\\".Justin Rood, \\"Lewis Ex-Aide's Turnaround Lobbying, Legal -- Barely\\" , TPMMuckraker.com, June 14, 2006 White was paid $122,536 in 2001. Exactly when White took a pay cut is unclear, how her pay was cut, and why, is unclear. By one report, she received an $11,000 pay cut shortly before she left. Another report said that her salary decreased in February 2002, but also quoted a spokesman as saying that the main difference in pay between the years was because she got a bonus in 2001 but not 2002.Claire Vitucci and Duane W. Gang, \\"Pay cut spared departing Lewis aide from 'cooling off' time\\" , Press- Enterprise, July 27, 2006 At Copeland Lowery, White quickly acquired a client roster of two dozen defense firms for which she sought earmarks and other special treatment. Indeed, the day after leaving the Hill, White signed up a major client, General Atomics, along with one of its aeronautics subsidiaries. The companies received several multimillion-dollar earmarks that year in the defense spending bill for the 2004 fiscal year. In 2003 her clients reported paying her lobbying fees totaling $850,000; in 2004 she brought in $1.44 million; in 2005, it was more than $3.5 million Nearly all the firms were defense contractors, according to records at politicalmoneyline.com. If White was a partner during those three years, she would have been paid $4‚Äì5 million for her work during the period. In addition, according to the former chief financial officer of Trident (a company that is client of Copeland Lowery), the owner of Trident (Nicholas Karangelen) had an arrangement with White where she would get a bonus based on the company's profitability. The former executive said she and two other company officials were fired after they questioned the company's financial relationship with White. At the request of Copley News Service, budget watchdog Keith Ashdown examined appropriations bills to see how White's clients had fared. Ashdown said he was astonished at her success in getting earmarks. The overall success rate for earmark requests submitted to Congress is 1 in 4, Ashdown said. In baseball terms that's a .250 average. \\"Letitia White is hitting about .600 or .700,\\" Ashdown said. \\"She might be the lobbyist batting champion. If I were looking for an earmark, I'd hire her in a heartbeat.\\" \\"Special interests want to buy influence,\\" he said. \\"People know that if you keep Letitia White happy, you keep Jerry Lewis happy.\\" For the fiscal year 2006 federal budget, Ashdown identified more than $230 million of earmarks benefiting more than two-thirds of White's 53 clients in 2005. The earmarks have financed projects such as machine cognition research in Florida and ammunition manufacturing in Kansas. =Richard White= In 2000, Richard White, Letitia's husband, began lobbying for \\"defense spending items\\". He continued to work from home, as he had when he was a tobacco lobbyist. Rather than being paid directly by defense contractors and other clients, he was paid by another lobbying firm, R.C. Whitner & Associates, whose principal and sole lobbyist is Richard Whitner. From 2000 to 2005, White received $205,000 from the group. It's not clear which of the Whitner's clients White was working for, so it is impossible to tell if any got earmarks or other support from Lewis. Further, Whitner did not register as a lobbyist starting in 2002, so the clients that White was lobbying for (via Whitner) are totally unknown.Paul Kiel, \\"Phantom Funds Flowed to Husband of Lewis Aide\\" , TPMMuckracker.com, June 12, 2005 In 2003, Richard White began getting defense contractors directly as clients, without going through Whitner, for whose clients he continued to work. In 2005, he reported having six defense clients and receiving $280,000 in fees. =Jeff Shockey= During 1999-2004, while working at Copeland Lowery, Jeff Shockey helped win at least $150 million in earmarks and government funding for clients of the firm, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. In 2004, clients represented by Shockey, one of Copeland Lowery's named partners, provided 33 percent of the firm's revenue. For 2005, after Shockey had left the firm (in January) to become deputy chief of staff of the House Appropriations Committee, his former clients paid 39 percent of the firm's $7.4 million in revenue.Paul Kiel, \\"Shockey Made Rain for Lobby Firm Even While on The Hill\\" , TPMMuckracker, June 14, 2006 When Shockey left the firm in January 2005 to return to work for Lewis, he accepted a salary of just under $160,000. That put him among the best-paid congressional employees, but it was a big reduction from the $1.5 million he earned at Copeland Lowery in 2003, and the $2.0 million in 2004. Shockey, however, did not have to live on a government salary in 2005. In late 2004, just before leaving the firm, he received about $600,000 from the firm; he also got two more payments in 2005, while a government employee, for a total of $1.96 million. According to Shockey's financial disclosure form that was filed in June 2006, the payments were part of a \\"separation/buy out\\" agreement for \\"ownership in and undistributed profits\\" from the firm. Shockey's lawyers said that they sent a letter to the House ethics committee in April 2005, in what they said was an effort to make sure the severance payments made to Shockey were \\"appropriate.\\"Susan Crabtree, \\"Lewis aide received nearly $2 million from lobbying firm\\" , The Hill, June 9, 2006 His attorneys said that the partisan fight that effectively shut down the ethics panel for eighteen months may have played role in explaining why they never received a follow-up letter from the committee giving its approval of the arrangement.Paul Kane and John Bresnahan, \\"Aide Got $1.9M Buyout\\" , Roll Call, June 12, 2006 On June 9, 2006, attorneys for Shockey said that the $1.96 million was based on a projection by the firm that Shockey would have billed clients for $3 million in 2005 if he had remained a lobbyist, a 76 percent increase from the $1.7 million in his billings in 2004.Charles R. Babcock, \\"Lobbying Firm Made Payment to Hill Aide: Lewis Staffer Received Nearly $2 Million\\", Washington Post, June 10, 2006 According to Roll Call, the jump in revenue wasn't because Shockey was expected to bring in more clients‚Äîit jumped because the clients he already had were projected to pay more, sometimes a lot more, for his services. In other words, Shockey was worth a lot more to his clients on the Hill than on K Street, where Copeland Lowery is located. Shockey is not barred from doing work related to his own former clients (assuming they are being represented someone other than his wife, a lobbyist), but Lewis spokesman John Scofield said that Shockey nonetheless informally recuses himself from such activity. =Alexandra Shockey= In 2002 and 2004, Alexandra Shockey, who had left Lewis' employ to raise a family, reported her occupation as \\"homemaker\\" when she made contributions to the campaigns of Representative Mary Bono and President George W. Bush.Mary Bono Committee campaign contributions , donors with last names of P-T Fundrace 2004 Neighbor Search For another donation in 2004, she listed her occupation as \\"retired\\". Itemized receipts, \\"Friends of Joe Baca\\" committee, 2004 In February 2005, just weeks after her husband left Copeland Lowery to rejoin the Appropriations Committee, she apparently went back to work. She registered Copeland Lowery as a client for her lobbying firm, called Hillscape Associates, becoming a subcontractor to Copeland Lowery. Hillscape's address on federal disclosure forms is identical to that of the Lowery firm. Jeff Shockey's disclosure forms and lobbying records show that Letitia White took over at least 19 of Shockey's local clients after he left the firm. According to Lewis' spokesman, Jim Specht, Alexandra Shockey, as a subcontractor, was the one actually handling some of her husband's Inland Empire clients. One of those was the city of Redlands, California,Colleen Menschin, \\"Council split on whether to retain lobbyist\\" , Redlands Daily Facts, June 22, 2006 whose records have been subpoenaed. Hillscape initially reported receiving less than $20,000 in lobbying fees from Copeland Lowery and another client during the first half of 2005, according to disclosure reports filed in 2005. Hillscape filed amended disclosure reports in February 2006, less than two months after the first Lewis-Lowery story appeared in newspapers, that showed the company was paid $80,000 by Copeland Lowery from January 1 to June 30, 2005, plus another $40,000 by a second client, itself a California-based lobbying firm. The April 2005 letter that Jeff Shockey's lawyers sent to the House ethics committee concerning his severance agreement also covered the issue of Shockey's relationship to his wife. \\"This letter also asks the Committee to confirm that steps Mr. Shockey has taken to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest with his wife's government relations consulting business are sufficient to satisfy applicable House rules\\". The letter also said that \\"Mrs. Shockey may represent clients before the Appropriations Committee from time to time, but she and Mr. Shockey have agreed that she will not appear before or seek any official action from him on behalf of a client,\\" the lawyers also wrote. Attorney William Oldaker - also an earmark specialist who has served as treasurer for several political action committees \\\\- said that the couple sought his legal advice in 2005 about their working arrangement and he assured them they were complying with House ethics rules \\"in letter and spirit.\\" In May 2005, Congressman Lewis sent a letter to the House Ethics Committee, which Oldaker said he drafted, stating that \\"When I hired Mr. Shockey, I directed him, the Committee's other majority staff members, and my personal staff as follows: that Mr. Shockey will not take any action or otherwise involve himself in any matter in which his spouse is representing a client.\\" The letter also said \\"This includes asking his colleagues to meet with his spouse or her clients on any matter in which she is representing them.\\"  Benefits to Congressional staff, and other Congressional PACs  Lowery has cultivated relationships with the House Appropriations committee staff and with the staffs of some Representatives on that committee. For example, when the committee worked late one night to meet a legislative deadline, he sent the staff about $300 worth of sandwiches. The House Appropriations committee staff, meanwhile, has invited Lowery to birthday parties, going-away parties and baby showers. Over the years Lowery has become an active member of what Lewis calls \\"the Lewis family.\\" Lowery also contributed significant amounts to Congressional PACs. All told, between 1997 and 2006, \\"Lowery and his clients gave Cunningham's political campaign committees $459,000 and Lewis's committees $917,000, according to a tally by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.\\"  Lewis and Lowery statements on the controversy  *Lewis on his actions: \\"I have never recommended a lobbyist to any constituent, contractor or anyone seeking federal funds. I have absolutely never told anyone to provide 'stock options' or any other sort of compensation to someone who is their advisor or lobbyist. To do so would be extremely unethical, and it goes entirely against all of my principles of good governing.\\" \\"It is outrageous and false to suggest that I might have supported a program in order to provide some illicit benefit for a friend.\\" *Lewis on the FBI investigation:' \\"I encourage a thorough review of any project I have helped secure for my constituents. I am sure they all meet the highest standards of public benefit.\\" \\"Throughout my career, I have also made every effort to meet the highest ethical standards, and I am absolutely certain that any review of my work will confirm this.\\" *Copeland Lowery on their work: \\"Like many other firms, we work on routine bread-and-butter, run-of-the-mill appropriations that benefit cities and towns and hospitals and schools across the country. Our work is consistent with the laws, rules and regulations that govern Capitol Hill lobbying and is similar to work done every day, every month and every year by many in Washington.\\" (Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for the Copeland Lowery Jacquez Denton and White lobbying firm, in a statement to NBC News.) *Lewis on government employees who become lobbyists: Lewis views Jeff Shockey's decision to rejoin the House Appropriations committee staff not as another turn of Washington's revolving door, but as proof of the idealism he says is characteristic of the Shockeys, the Whites and Bill Lowery. \\"I'm very proud of the fact that these people basically are motivated by ... public service,\\" Lewis said. \\"They didn't come to Washington to get rich. Instead, they came to Washington because they actually wanted to serve.  Split-up of Copeland Lowery  In mid-June 2006, the two Democratic partners, James M. Copeland and Lynnette R. Jacquez, of the firm Copeland Lowery Jacquez Denton & White, told their Republican partners that they were leaving the firm. The reason, they said, was that ethical and legal questions surrounding Lowery and the firm threatened to destroy their professional reputations and ruin their commercial prospects. Copeland Lowery said in a written statement that \\"Partners Bill Lowery, Jean Denton, and Letitia White will continue to lead the existing full service consulting firm, while partners James M. Copeland and Lynn Jacquez will form a separate partnership.\\" The Democrats and the Republicans in the firm were already operating separately for the most part: The Republicans worked on the eighth floor of the downtown District of Columbia building they occupy, and the Democrats worked on the fifth floor. In June, Copeland and Jacquez formed a firm called CJ Strategies. Lowery, Denton and White formed a firm called Innovative Federal Strategies.Duane W.

It is located in southeastern Kings County. Located in the township of Lot 64, the community is named after General the Honourable James Murray, (1721‚Äì94), Governor of Quebec (1764‚Äì66). Murray Harbour With an area of 4.1 km2 and an extensive waterfront facing a large natural harbour (also named Murray Harbour), the community's primary industry is fishing, most notably lobster and scallops. It also hosts some secondary industry in the form of fish processing and a growing tertiary service economy centred on tourism. The community has a car repair station, a fire station, a grocery, two restaurants, a number of churches, a marina and a number of wharves. The Community Centre hosts many events throughout the year, including plays, music and comedy shows - including Small Halls Festival - ceilidhs, suppers, painting classes, seniors' events and more. Behind the Community Centre is a large double dog park and an outdoor rink/ball hockey rink. In summer 2017 a huge playground (for ages 5 to 13) and a skate park will be added. The majority of the community's fishing fleet is berthed at the South River Harbour facility which is operated by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Other wharves include the Murray Harbour wharf, Machon Point wharf, and Beach Point wharf, as well as the Bowridge Landing Marina. In recent years, Murray Harbour has attracted many retirees.

The book is about Canada's restrictive immigration policy towards Jewish refugees during the Holocaust years. The book helped popularize the phrase \\"none is too many\\" in Canada.  Overview  First published in 1983 by Lester & Orpen Dennys, and reissued in 2012 by University of Toronto Press, the book documents the history of the Canadian response to Jewish refugees from 1933, with the rise of the Nazi government in Germany, until 1948. The authors argue that while many nations were complicit in the Holocaust for their refusal to admit Jewish refugees during the Nazi era, the Canadian government did less than other Western countries to help Jewish refugees between 1933 and 1948. The most infamous example of Canada's immigration policy was the refusal to admit the MS St. Louis, a German ocean liner carrying refugees. Only 5,000 Jewish refugees entered Canada from 1933 until 1945, which the book argues was the worst of any refugee receiving nation in the world. This response was possible in part because of Canada's history of Antisemitism. The authors identify Frederick Blair, the head of immigration in William Lyon Mackenzie King's government, as a top official who opposed and limited Jewish immigration. They say that Blair's policy had the full support of Mackenzie King, who was prime minister 1935‚Äì48, Vincent Massey, the high commissioner to Britain, and both Anglophone and Francophone elites in general.  Title  The title is based on an incident recounted in the book. Early in 1939 an unidentified immigration agent was asked how many Jews would be allowed in Canada after the war.

In 2011, a monument, referred to in the media as the \\"none is too many\\" memorial, was displayed in Halifax's Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 to commemorate the MS St. Louis. In 2015, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau was criticized by some Jewish groups after he used the phrase to criticize the Conservative government's immigration policy for Muslims.  Influence  The book is periodically referenced in debates on immigration policy in Canada. Co-author Irving Abella writes that \\"it has become an ethical yardstick against which contemporaneous government policies are gauged\\". In 1979, Canada's deputy minister of immigration reportedly handed a copy of the book to immigration minister Ron Atkey, saying \\"this should not be you\\". Atkey then advocate for the admission of more Vietnamese refugees to Canada. \\"He drew the parallels to our attention, was moved by it himself and we all were\\", prime minister Joe Clark recalled.

It is sponsored by the CfBT Education Trust.Liam Sloan, New academy pledges to be best school in the city, Oxford Mail, 7 January 2011. The school has a co-educational student body of 1,087, and has specialist Business and Enterprise College status. The student body is drawn from across the city, though the majority of pupils are from the Cowley, Rose Hill, East Oxford, Donnington, and Blackbird Leys areas of the city. The school has long had a very varied and multicultural student body, reflecting the community in which it is based, and can claim to be the city's most \\"international\\" school. The school's work with refugee children and those for whom English is not their first language has been notable. History The school was originally established in 1966, following a merger between Southfield Grammar School and the City of Oxford High School for Boys, taking over Southfield Grammar School's Glanville Road site. The school was a single- sex grammar school for boys until 1972, when it became comprehensive, taking the first intake in September of that year. Entry also changed from aged 11 to aged 13 with the introduction of Middle Schools in Oxford. A reform of the educational system in the City of Oxford in the 1990s saw the school become coeducational. In 2003 the school changed from a 14-19 Upper School to an 11-19 Secondary School due to the City of Oxford Reorganisation. In 2005 the school gained Business and Enterprise status, providing extra funding for a state of the art conference centre. In 2006, the school recorded its best ever GCSE results. At the beginning of 2008 Oxford Community School became a Foundation School. The school has achieved Green Flag Eco-School Status. At the start of 2011 the school reopened as Oxford Spires Academy. A new uniform was chosen and school took on a distinctive purple colour theme both in uniform and on the site itself. Ofsted undertook a monitoring inspectionOfsted inspection report April 2012, section 8 inspection report, of Oxford Spires Academy in April 2012 and determined that Oxford Spires Academy had made good progress towards raising standards. This was confirmed in Summer 2012 when Oxford Spires Academy achieved outstanding GCSE results. 78% of students achieved 5 or more A*-C grades and 57% students achieved 5 or more A*-C grades including English and Mathematics. In 2014 The Oxford Mail reported allegations that Spires had excluded many of its least able students to bolster its external exam results, and therefore its standing in school league tables. Sue Croft, the first Principal of Oxford Spires Academy, retired at the end of the 2016-17 academic year. Her successor, Marianne Blake, took up post in September 2017. Ofsted undertook a short inspectionOfsted short inspection report January 2018, short inspection report, of Oxford Spires Academy in November 2017 and determined that Oxford Spires Academy continued to be good.

Early years Verco, born at Fullarton, South Australia, was a son of James Crabb Verco. Both his parents came from Cornwall, UK. He was educated at the J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, and after spending a year in the South Australian Railways, intending to become a civil engineer, he decided to take up medicine. As he wished to matriculate at the University of London, he found it necessary to do more work in classics and spent a year at St Peter's College, Adelaide for this purpose. At that school he won the Young exhibition, awarded to the best scholar of the year, and then went to London at the beginning of 1870. He obtained his M.R.C.S. in 1874; M.B. in 1875, with scholarship and the gold medals for forensic medicine and medicine; L.R.C.P. in 1875; B.S., with scholarship and gold medal; M.D.; and F.R.C.S. - all in London in 1876. Verco was one of the most brilliant students of his time and a successful career in London was open to him. Medical career Verco was appointed house physician at St Bartholomew's hospital in 1876, and midwifery assistant in 1877. In 1878 he returned to Adelaide. After a few years of general practice at Adelaide, Verco became recognized as its leading physician, and led a very busy life. From 1882 to 1912 he was honorary physician to the Adelaide hospital, and then honorary consulting physician. In 1898, Samuel Barbour sold his X-ray apparatus for ¬£120 to Verco.Vox.

He was lecturer in medicine at the University of Adelaide from 1887 to 1915, President of the Adelaide Medical Students' Society in 1904 and 1906‚Äì1915, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine 1919-21, and subsequently Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry. He was a member of the council of the University from 1895 to 1902 and 1919 to 1933. He was president of the South Australian branch of the British Medical Association in 1886-7 and 1914-19. For some years before his retirement from practice in 1919, he specialized in consultative work as a physician. He did not do much writing on medical subjects, but with E. C. Stirling wrote the article on hydatid disease in Allbutt's System of Medicine. \\"This not only collated the early literature, but was illuminated by the authors' personal experience of cases and at the time was recognized as a classic presentation of the subject\\".British Medical Journal, 12 August 1933, p. 317. Scientific interests Verco's interest in science was not confined to its medical side. He was elected a fellow of the Adelaide Philosophical Society, (subsequently the Royal Society of South Australia) in 1878. From a lad he had been interested in shells and he began his serious study of this subject in 1887. He did a large amount of dredging in the Great Australian Bight of much value to marine biology. He collaborated with Charles Hedley and Professor William A. Haswell in investigating South Australia's continental shelf.Denis Fairfax, 'Hedley, Charles (1862 - 1926)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 9, MUP, 1983, pp 252-253. Retrieved 13 March 2009 His work as a taxonomist included the description of Sepia braggi, the slender cuttlefish. His own collection of shells became a very fine one, and he had an excellent and valuable library of literature on the subject. This collection, including the books, was eventually presented to the South Australian Museum, where Verco spent much time after his retirement as honorary conchologist. He was mentor to Bernard Charles Cotton, who served as the museum's Curator of Molluscs from 1934 to 1962. His general interest in the Royal Society was very great and he was an admirable president. First elected to that office in 1903, he was re- elected year by year, until 1921 when he declined further nomination. As vice- president or member of the council, his connexion was maintained until his death. He started its research and endowment fund with the sum of ¬£1,000 in 1908, and on several other occasions gave financial aid when it was required. Verco was knighted in 1919.

However, when a thunderstorm during the first (and only scheduled) concert destroyed all of its memorabilia/merchandise, the performance did not prove profitable, and Ross used personal resources to fund the project.

HISTORY Giaveno has very ancient origins; some local history scholars trace the first settlement back to Roman times. The important Gavi family of Augusta Taurinorum (Turin) built a farmhouse here, probably in the 1st century AD; to corroborate this thesis there are some random finds of necropolis materials in the fields at the Sanctuary of the Madonna del Bussone (Villa village) and a stretch of paving at the bridge of the Tortorello torrent. It is said that Charlemagne in 773 crossed the watershed that divides the Val di Susa from that of the Sangone, came to the plain located near the village Gavensis and caught the Longobards from behind between the Chiusa di S. Michele and Villardora and defeating them. In 1103 the Count of Savoy, Umberto II, donated the territory of Giaveno to the Abbey of San Michele della Chiusa, but Federico Barbarossa, despot of the time, on January 26, 1195 removed it from the Abbey to give it to Charles I, bishop of Turin. Giaveno returned to the abbots of San Michele with a donation from the Count of Savoy Tommaso I on 21 February 1209, who fortified the square with a robust wall and built a castle there. Subsequently, in 1347, Abbot Rodolfo di Mombello decided to \\"villam iavenni murare\\", with two trebuchet walls (about 6 meters high), interspersed with five circular towers. The perimeter of the \\"Abbey Citadel\\" is still clearly legible today. In 1611 a new patron S. Antero, whose relics were moved from Rome to Giaveno, joins the owner of the protection of the village, S. Lorenzo. In 1622 Cardinal Maurizio asked for and obtained from the Holy See the erection bull of the Insigne Collegiate of San Lorenzo Martire. At the end of the seventeenth century the numerous raids with looting by the French general Nicolas Catinat stripped the villages, the castle and the churches. 1630 proved to be a particularly critical year for the country, since during the Second Monferrato War (episode to be framed in the 30-year conflict), Giaveno was occupied by French troops led by the Duke of Montmorency. In the meantime, plague erupts throughout Piedmont, reaping huge victims. The Savoys go to war against the French. Marshal of France Nicolas Catinat invades Piedmont, putting it on fire and, after the battle of Marsaglia (1693) won by the French, Giaveno undergoes looting and fire. The French were defeated and driven out of Piedmont after the fatal siege of Turin on 8 September 1706. Important pages of history were written in the Resistance period (1943 - 1945) which saw the partisans and the entire population. rise up against Nazi-fascist oppression. For these episodes, the town of Giaveno was awarded the silver medal for military value by the President of the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (1997).

Schuppanzigh and his quartet premiered many of Beethoven's string quartets, and in particular, the late string quartets. The Razumovsky quartet, which Schuppanzigh founded in late 1808, is considered to be the first professional string quartet. Until the founding of this quartet, quartet music was played primarily by amateurs or by professional musicians who joined together on an ad hoc basis. Biography Schuppanzigh was born in Vienna, son of a professor of Italian at the Theresian Military Academy. After abandoning his early preference for the viola, he established himself before his 21st birthday as a virtuoso violist and violinist, as well as a conductor. He gave violin lessons to Beethoven, and they remained friends until Beethoven's death. Schuppanzigh's dedication to quartet playing played a pivotal role in the transition of quartet performance and composition. Prior to Beethoven, the quartet repertoire could be performed successfully by either competent amateurs or professionals with few rehearsals. Beethoven's quartets, starting with the three of Op. 59 dedicated to Count Razumovsky, introduced many new technical difficulties that could not be completely overcome without dedicated rehearsal. These difficulties include synchronized complex runs played by two or more instruments together, cross-rhythms and hemiolas, and difficult harmonies that require special attention to intonation. When informed that Schuppanzigh had complained about a particularly difficult passage, Beethoven is said to have remarked, \\"Does he really believe that I think about his silly fiddle when the muse strikes me to compose?\\" Razumovsky's quartet also premiered works by other composers. Franz Schubert dedicated his A minor \\"Rosamunde\\" quartet to Schuppanzigh. Schuppanzigh's was the first professional string quartet that gave concerts for subscription-paying audiences. He is said to have dragged Beethoven to a brothel, incurring Beethoven's wrath, after which he avoided Beethoven for months afterward. Beethoven often joked about his corpulence, calling him 'Milord Falstaff', a comment aimed at both his weight and his fun-loving propensity, and wrote a short comical chorus dedicated to him, \\"Praise to the Fat One\\" (\\"Lob auf den Dicken\\"), WoO 100. Schuppanzigh was described as handsome in his youth, but in adult life he became seriously obese. Toward the end of his life, his fingers reputedly grew so fat that he was unable to play in tune, and reputedly died of paralysis in Vienna.

With nonfunctional streak ovaries, she is low in estrogen levels (hypoestrogenic) and has high levels of FSH and LH. Estrogen and progesterone therapy is usually then commenced. This syndrome is inherited as an autosomal disease. It affects both males and females, but the phenotype differs. In both sexes, sensorineural deafness occurs, but in females ovarian dysgenesis also occurs. XX GD as a form of ‚Äúpure gonadal dysgenesis‚Äù The term ‚Äúpure gonadal dysgenesis‚Äù (PGD) has been used to distinguish a group of patients from gonadal dysgenesis related to Turner syndrome. In the latter a distinct chromosomal aberration is present, while in PGD the chromosomal constellation is either 46,XX or 46,XY. Thus XX gonadal dysgenesis is also referred to as PGD, 46 XX, and XY gonadal dysgenesis as PGD, 46,XY or Swyer syndrome.Log In Problems Patients with PGD have a normal chromosomal constellation but may have localized genetic alterations. Presentation = Related conditions = XX gonadal dysgenesis is related to the Swyer syndrome inasmuch as both conditions have the same phenotype and clinical issues; however in Swyer syndrome the karyotype is 46,XY, and thus gonadectomy is recommended. In Turner syndrome there is a demonstrable abnormality in or absence of one of the sex chromosomes that is the cause of the development of gonadal dysgenesis. In contrast XX gonadal dysgenesis has a normal female chromosome situation. Another type of XX gonadal dysgenesis is known as 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis epibulbar dermoid, which follows the similar symptoms as the regular syndrome, though it also shows signs of epibulbar dermoid (eye disorder).ORPHANET - About rare diseases - About orphan drugs It has been suggested to be a new type of syndrome.  Pathogenesis  The cause of the condition is often unclear. There are cases where abnormalities in the FSH-receptor have been reported. Apparently either the germ cells do not form or interact with the gonadal ridge or undergo accelerated atresia so that at the end of childhood only a streak gonad is present, unable to induce pubertal changes. As girls' ovaries produce no important body changes before puberty, there is usually no suspicion of a defect of the reproductive system until puberty fails to occur. Familial cases of XX gonadal dysgenesis are on record. In one family mutations in the mitochondrial histidyl tRNA synthetase have been described as the cause.Pierce SB, Chisholm KM, Lynch ED, Lee MK, Walsh T, Opitz JM, Li W, Klevit RE, King MC (2011) Mutations in mitochondrial histidyl tRNA synthetase HARS2 cause ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural hearing loss of Perrault syndrome. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. Perrault syndrome In 1951, Perrault reported the association of gonadal dysgenesis and deafness, now called Perrault syndrome.Perrault, M.; Klotz, B.; Housset, E. :Deux cas de syndrome de Turner avec surdi-mutite dans une meme fratrie. Bull. Mem. Soc. Med. Hop. Paris 16: 79-84, 1951.  Diagnosis  Because of the inability of the streak gonads to produce sex hormones (both estrogens and androgens), most of the secondary sex characteristics do not develop. This is especially true of estrogenic changes such as breast development, widening of the pelvis and hips, and menstrual periods. Because the adrenal glands can make limited amounts of androgens and are not affected by this syndrome, most of these girls will develop pubic hair, though it often remains sparse. Evaluation of delayed puberty usually reveals the presence of pubic hair, but elevation of gonadotropins, indicating that the pituitary is providing the signal for puberty but the gonads are failing to respond. The next steps of the evaluation usually include checking a karyotype and imaging of the pelvis. The karyotype reveals XX chromosomes and the imaging demonstrates the presence of a uterus but no ovaries (the streak gonads are not usually seen by most imaging). At this point it is usually possible for a physician to make a diagnosis of XX gonadal dysgenesis.  Treatment  The consequences to the girl with XX gonadal dysgenesis: # Her gonads cannot make estrogen, so her breasts will not develop and her uterus will not grow and menstruate until she is given estrogen. This is often given through the skin now. # Her gonads cannot make progesterone, so her menstrual periods will not be predictable until she is given a progestin, still usually as a pill. # Her gonads cannot produce eggs so she will not be able to conceive children naturally. A woman with a uterus but no ovaries may be able to become pregnant by implantation of another woman's fertilized egg (embryo transfer).

This Worldcon never chose an official name other than the title \\"10th World Science Fiction Convention,\\" as both the convention's issued membership card and program book clearly stated. Only the first Worldcon in New York City (1939) and the 11th in Philadelphia, 1953, shared this lack of a formal convention name. The phrases \\"Tenth Anniversary World Science Fiction Convention\\" (TAWSFiC) and \\"Tenth Anniversary Science Fiction Convention\\" (TASFiC, likely a simple linotype error, as \\"World\\" is missing) were each used in some of this Worldcon's pre-convention materials; the phrase's acronyms \\"TAWSFiC\\" and \\"TASFiC\\" were never officially used in print or otherwise by the Chicago committee at that time. However, the 10th Worldcon was frequently referred to by its members by the unofficial name Chicon II, so dubbed after the previous Chicago Worldcon (Chicon) in 1940; this name proved so popular that the convention became known as Chicon II in science fiction fandom's lore and written histories. The convention chair was Julian C. May (later also known as Judy Dikty). Hugo Gernsback was the convention's official guest of honor. The program included the performance of an original science fiction ballet. For years this Worldcon held the record for the largest attendance at any early science fiction convention, with 870 registered attendees, a figure which was not surpassed by another Worldcon until 1967 for Nycon 3 in New York City. By way of comparison, the previous year's Worldcon, the Nolacon in New Orleans, had an attendance of 190. It was at this Worldcon that the idea for the Hugo science fiction awards was first proposed and adopted. These awards, the highest and oldest honor in science fiction, were first awarded at the 1953 Worldcon in Philadelphia. The convention is said to have been the place where Sturgeon's Law was first formulated (although other origin stories claim Sturgeon first articulated the concept in 1951, a year earlier). During a panel discussion on science fiction, one of the panelists observed that about 90% of science fiction was crud. Theodore Sturgeon, also on the panel, replied that 90% of everything was crud.

Description Clematis vitalba is a climbing shrub with branched, grooved stems, deciduous leaves, and scented greeny-white flowers with fluffy underlying sepals. The many fruits formed in each inflorescence have long silky appendages which, seen together, give the characteristic appearance of old man's beard. The grooves along the stems of C. vitalba can easily be felt when handling the plant. This species is eaten by the larvae of a wide range of moths. This includes many species which are reliant on it as their sole foodplant; including small emerald, small waved umber and Haworth's pug. Range C. vitalba has a preference for base rich alkaline soils and moist climate with warm summers. =United Kingdom= In the UK it is a native plant and is common throughout England south of a line from the River Mersey and the River Humber. It also commonly occurs in southern, Eastern and northern Wales. Outside of these areas it is widely planted and occurs as far north as the southern highlands of Scotland.New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora Characteristics *Reproductive organs: ** Inflorescence type: biparous cyme ** Sex: hermaphrodite ** Type of pollination: entomophilous *Seed: ** Type of fruit: achene ** Dissemination: With the wind *Habitat and distribution: ** Type of habitat: Mid-European shrubberies, mountainsides, in moderately eutrophic regions ** Distribution: Holarctic Invasiveness Due to its disseminatory reproductive system, vitality, and climbing behavior, Clematis vitalba is an invasive plant in many places. Some new tree plantations can be suffocated by a thick layer of Clematis vitalba, if not checked. ;New Zealand In New Zealand it is declared an \\"unwanted organism\\" and is listed in the National Pest Plant Accord. It cannot be sold, propagated or distributed. It is a potential threat to native plants since it grows vigorously and forms a canopy which smothers all other plants and has no natural controlling organisms in New Zealand.

In Christian literature, the equivalent are the Centuriae. In Hebrew the word melitzah means joke or witticism. Melitzah, in effect, recalls Walter Benjamin's desire to someday write a work composed entirely of quotations. At any rate, it was a literary device employed widely in medieval Hebrew poetry and prose, then through the movement known as Haskalah, Hebrew for ‚Äúenlightenment,‚Äù and even among nineteenth-century writers both modern and traditional. What is so special about this particular literary device is that in melitzah the sentences compounded out of quotations mean what they say; but below and beyond the surface they reverberate with associations to the original texts, and this is what makes them psychologically so interesting and valuable. In the transposition of a quotation from the original (in this case canonical) text to a new one, the meaning of the original context may be retained, altered, or subverted. In any case the original context trails along as an invisible interlinear presence, and the readers, like the writer, must be aware of these associations if they are to savor the new text to the full. A partial analogy may be found in T. S. Eliot's use of quotations in The Waste Land. If he is successful in his use of melitzah, the author will arouse in the reader a particular set of images and associations which will add a certain texture and tone to what is being described‚Äîthe chordal accompaniment, so to speak, to the melodic line.

John Wilbur Chapman (June 17, 1859, Richmond, Indiana ‚Äì December 25, 1918, New York, New York) was a Presbyterian evangelist in the late 19th century, generally traveling with gospel singer Charles Alexander. His parents were Alexander H. and Lorinda (McWhinney) Chapman. Faith & Education Chapman grew up attending Quaker Day School and Methodist Sunday School. At age 17, he made a public declaration of his Christian faith and joined the Richmond Presbyterian Church. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Lake Forest College and his seminary degree from Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio. He completed his ordination into the ministry 13 April 1881, while still attending Lane. He was later awarded a doctorate in divinity from the College of Wooster and an LL.D. from Heidelberg University. Family In May 1882, Chapman married Irene Steddom. In April 1886, she bore him a daughter, Bertha Irene Chapman. Irene Steddom Chapman died in May 1886. Chapman remarried on November 4, 1888, to Agnes Pruyn Strain; they had four children: Robert (who died in infancy), John Wilbur Jr., Alexander Hamilton, and Agnes Pruyn. His second wife died on June 25, 1907. Chapman married a third and final time on August 30, 1910, to Mabel Cornelia Moulton. Ministry Chapman took on several pastorates before shifting to the evangelistic circuit. He began preaching with the legendary D.L. Moody in 1893, as well as leading many evangelistic events of his own. While not personally responsible for his conversion, Chapman was a strong influence on the ministry of Billy Sunday. In late 1895, Chapman was appointed Corresponding Secretary of the Presbyterian General Assembly's Committee on Evangelism, overseeing the activities of 51 evangelists in 470 cities. In 1904, Chapman began work on an evangelistic campaign to maximize the efforts of his field evangelists and result in more converts. The testing ground for his theories was Pittsburgh, which he divided into nine zones in which simultaneous tent meetings would be occurring. Syracuse, New York was the second city in the campaign, meeting with a satisfactory level of success. In 1905, John H. Converse, a wealthy Presbyterian philanthropist, offered to underwrite Chapman's expenses if he would re-enter the evangelistic field full-time. Converse also set up a trust fund so as to finance Chapman's crusades posthumously. Chapman accepted the offer and in 1907, joined forces with popular gospel singer Charles McCallon Alexander to launch the \\"Chapman- Alexander Simultaneous Campaign.\\" The duo assembled an impressive team of evangelists and songleaders and took to the streets. The first joint campaign was held in Philadelphia from March 12 to April 19, 1908. They partitioned the city into 42 sections covered by 21 evangelist-musicians teams. They spent three weeks on each half of the city, resulting in approximately 8000 conversions. It was at a similar Chapman-Alexander event in North Carolina that the legendary King James Only proponent, David Otis Fuller, committed to the Christian faith. In 1909, Chapman demanded that any field evangelist who doubted the inerrancy of Scripture be removed from ministry. Chapman's biography reports, \\"The first Chapman-Alexander worldwide campaign left Vancouver, British Columbia on March 26, 1909, and returned on November 26, 1909. The itinerary included: Melbourne, Sydney, Ipswich, Brisbane, Adelaide, Ballarat, Bendigo, and Townsville in Australia; Manila in the Philippines; Hong Kong, Kowloon, Canton, Shanghai, Hankow, Peking and Tientsin in China; Seoul, Korea; Kobe, Kyoto, Tokyo, and Yokohama in Japan.\\"Billy Graham Collection , Papers of John Wilbur Chapman During these years, Chapman was also heavily involved in the promoting of religious summer conferences. He was at one point the director of the Winona Lake Bible Conference in Indiana and also helped to establish bible conferences in Montreat, North Carolina and the Stony Brook Assembly summer conferences on Long Island, founded in 1909.Truthful Words, J. Wilbur Chapman Chapman became heavily involved in the Stony Brook conferences in his later years, seeing that it had the most promise of flourishing because of its close proximity to New York City. After his death, his widow, Mabel Cornelia Moulton, gave to the Stony Brook Assembly the gift of a paved driveway in his memory. Today, 1 Chapman Parkway still serves as the address of The Stony Brook School, which was founded in 1922 as an extension of the summer conferences. By the end of 1910, Chapman's \\"mass evangelism\\" technique was losing favor in evangelistic circles, and Chapman and Alexander were back to large meeting revivals by 1912. The final Chapman- Alexander revival tour was conducted January 6, 1918 to February 13, 1918. In May 1918, Chapman was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, a position which inundated him with such a high level of stress that he developed a serious enough case of gall stones to need emergency surgery on December 23, 1918, and died two days later, on Christmas Day, aged 59.

Anthonius Groenendaal (born 13 July 1971) is a Dutch former professional cyclo-cross cyclist. Groenendaal won the UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships in 2000 and the overall titles in the UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup 1997‚Äì1998, 2000‚Äì2001 and 2003‚Äì2004 and in the Cyclo-cross Superprestige in 1997‚Äì1998 and 2000‚Äì2001. Early career Groenendaal's father Reinier was an Elite cyclo-cross cyclist and was Dutch Elite champion in 1985. Groenendaal began to ride as a junior in 1987. He was Dutch Junior champion in 1987-1988 and 1988-89 where he also won the Junior World Cyclo-Cross championships. The following season he joined the Amateur category which he stayed until the 1993-94 season when he turned professional. Early in his career he showed promise as a road rider by finishing in the top ten in the 1992 Tour de l'Avenir, the year he also took part in the Summer Olympics road race. At the start of Groenendaal's career he was often compared to his father Rein and one commentator in Belgium sometimes referred to him as Reintje. However, after two seasons, Groenendaal had stood on more international podiums than his father and the comparisons stopped. In 1996 Groenendaal joined the newly formed Dutch cycling team Rabobank which he would stay with until the end of the 2006-2007 season when he choose to ride for an individual sponsor. Groenendaal's greatest achievements include winning the Cyclo-Cross World Cup in 1998, 2001 and 2004 and becoming Cyclo-Cross World Champion in 2000. Groenendaal attacked during the first lap and was chased by defending cyclo- cross world champion Mario De Clercq who was followed by Groenendaal's Rabobank teammate Sven Nys. Nys would not cooperate in the chase of his commercial teammate and as a result De Clercq never caught Groenendaal enabling Groenendaal to become World Champion. In the following season, Groenendaal dominated cyclo-cross with wins in the Superprestige series and the World Cup as well as being number one UCI ranked rider. Groenendaal also won the Dutch National Cyclo-cross championships. Groenendaal started as a big favourite for the World Championships but suffered a crash during the race and did not recover and as a result lost his Rainbow jersey. In the 2001-2002 season, Groenendaal lost the national cyclo-cross jersey to teammate Gerben de Knegt but did win the final World Cup of the season in Heerlen which made him a favourite for the World Championships which were taking place a week later. However, Mario De Clercq won ahead of Nys and Vannoppen. Groenendaal finished fourth and as best non-Belgian. Groenendaal won the first race of the Gazet van Antwerpen trophy of the 2002-2003 season with the Koppenbergcross ahead of Nys and Wellens. He also won a World Cup. For the 2003-2004 season, Groenendaal suffered from a knee injury at the start of the season. At the end of the season, he recovered some form and won the Dutch national champions jersey. In an unexpected finale, Groenendaal took the 2003-2004 World Cup classification after the final event of the season. Groenendaal won the final world cup race where there were double points on offer in Pijnacker, while teammate and World Cup leader Sven Nys finished further back and lost the lead in the World Cup classification. Groenendaal kept up his form to win the final Gazet van Antwerpen race. In the 2008 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships Groenendaal helped Dutch National teammate Lars Boom to launch his attack at the start of the final lap and win the gold medal.

There are sphygmomanometer drains connected with esophageal port, to enable inflating the balloon with correct pressure. A Sengstaken‚ÄìBlakemore tube is a medical device inserted through the nose or mouth and used occasionally in the management of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to esophageal varices (distended and fragile veins in the esophageal wall, usually a result of cirrhosis). The use of the tube was originally described in 1950, although similar approaches to bleeding varices were described by Westphal in 1930. With the advent of modern endoscopic techniques which can rapidly and definitively control variceal bleeding, Sengstaken‚ÄìBlakemore tubes are rarely used at present. The device consists of a flexible plastic tube containing several internal channels and two inflatable balloons. Apart from the balloons, the tube has an opening at the bottom (gastric tip) of the device. More modern models also have an opening near the upper esophagus; such devices are properly termed Minnesota tubes. The tube is passed down into the esophagus and the gastric balloon is inflated inside the stomach. A traction of 1 kg is applied to the tube so that the gastric balloon will compress the gastroesophageal junction and reduce the blood flow to esophageal varices. If the use of traction alone cannot stop the bleeding, the esophageal balloon is also inflated to help stop the bleeding. The esophageal balloon should not remain inflated for more than six hours, to avoid necrosis. The gastric lumen is used to aspirate stomach contents. Generally, Sengstaken‚ÄìBlakemore tubes are used only in emergencies where bleeding from presumed varices is impossible to control with medication alone. The tube may be difficult to position, particularly in an unwell patient, and may inadvertently be inserted in the trachea, hence endotracheal intubation before the procedure is strongly advised to secure the airway. The tube is often kept in the refrigerator in the hospital's emergency department, intensive care unit and gastroenterology ward. It is a temporary measure: ulceration and rupture of the esophagus and stomach are recognized complications. A related device with a larger gastric balloon capacity (about 500 ml), the Linton‚ÄìNachlas tube, is used for bleeding gastric varices. It does not have an esophageal balloon. Eponym It is named after Robert William Sengstaken Sr. (1923-1978), an American neurosurgeon, and Arthur Blakemore (1897‚Äì1970), an American vascular surgeon. They conceptualized and invented the tube in the early 1950s.

It is the atypical development of the gonads in an embryo, with reproductive tissue replaced with functionless, fibrous tissue, termed streak gonads. Streak gonads are a form of aplasia, resulting in hormonal failure that manifests as sexual infantism and infertility, with no initiation of puberty and secondary sex characteristics. Gonadal development is a genetically controlled process by the chromosomal sex (XX or XY) which directs the formation of the gonad (ovary or testis). Differentiation of the gonads requires a tightly regulated cascade of genetic, molecular and morphogenic events. At the formation of the developed gonad, steroid production influences local and distant receptors for continued morphological and biochemical changes. This results in the appropriate phenotype corresponding to the karyotype (46,XX for females and 46,XY for males). Gonadal dysgenesis arises from the failure of signalling in this tightly regulated process during early foetal development. Manifestations of gonadal dysgenesis are dependent on the aetiology and severity of the underlying defect. Causes * Pure gonadal dysgenesis 46,XX also known as XX gonadal dysgenesis * Pure gonadal dysgenesis 46,XY also known as XY gonadal dysgenesis * Mixed gonadal dysgenesis also known as partial gonadal dysgenesis, and 45,X/46,XY mosaicism * Turner syndrome also known as 45,X or 45,X0 * Endocrine disruptions Pathogenesis =46,XX Gonadal Dysgenesis= 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis is characteristic of female hypogonadism with a karyotype of 46,XX. Streak ovaries are present with non-functional tissues unable to produce the required sex steroid oestrogen Low levels of oestrogen effect the HPG axis with no feedback to the anterior pituitary to inhibit the secretion of FSH and LH. FSH and LH are secreted at abnormal elevated levels. Improper levels of these hormones will cause a failure to initiate puberty, undergo menarche, and develop secondary sex characteristics. If sufficient functional ovarian tissue is present, limited menstrual cycles can occur. The pathogenesis of 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis is unclear, as it can manifest from a variety of dysregulations. Interruption during ovarian development in embryogenesis can cause 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis with cases of abnormalities in the FSH receptor and mutations in steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR protein) which regulates steroid hormone production. =46,XY Gonadal Dysgenesis= 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis is characteristic of male hypogonadism with karyotype 46,XY. In embryogenesis, the development of the male gonads is controlled by the testis determining factor located on the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY). The male gonad is dependent on SRY and the signalling pathways initiated to several other genes to facilitate testis development. The aetiology of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in the genes involved in testis development such as SRY, SOX9, WT1, SF1, and DHH. If a single or combination of these genes are mutated or deleted, downstream signalling is disrupted, leading to malformation of male external genitalia. SRY acts on gene SOX9 which drives Sertoli cell formation and testis differentiation. An absence in SRY causes SOX9 to not be expressed at the appropriate time or concentration, leading to a deficiency in testosterone and Anti-M√ºllerian hormone production. Inadequate levels of testosterone and Anti-M√ºllerian hormone disrupts the development of Wolffian ducts and internal genitalia that are key to male reproductive tract development. The lack of the male associated steroid hormones drives M√ºllerian duct development and perusal of the development of female genitalia. Gonadal streaks replace the tissues of the testes, resembling ovarian stroma absent of follicles. 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis can remain unsuspected until delayed pubertal development is observed. Approximately 15% of cases of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis carry de novo mutations in the SRY gene, with an unknown causation for the remaining portion of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis patients. =Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis= Mixed gonadal dysgenesis, also known as X0/XY mosaicism or partial gonadal dysgenesis is a sex development disorder associated with sex chromosome aneuploidy and mosaicism of the Y chromosome. Mixed gonadal dysgenesis is the presence of two or more germ line cells. The degree of development of the male reproductive tract is determined by the ratio of germ line cells expressing the XY genotype. Manifestations of mixed gonadal dysgenesis are highly variable with asymmetry in gonadal development of testis and streak gonad, accounted for by the percentage of cells expressing XY genotype. The dysgenic testis can have adequate functional tissue to produce satisfactory levels of testosterone to cause masculinisation. Mixed gonadal dysgenesis is poorly understood at the molecular level. The loss of the Y chromosome can occur from deletions, translocations, or migration failure of paired chromosomes during cell division. The chromosomal loss results in partial expression of the SRY gene, giving rise to abnormal development of the reproductive tract and altered hormones levels. =Turner syndrome= Turner syndrome, also known as 45,X or 45,X0, is a chromosomal abnormality characterised by a partial or completely missing second X chromosome giving a chromosomal count of 45, instead of the correct count of 46 chromosomes. Dysregulation in meiosis signalling to germ cells during embryogenesis may result in nondisjunction and monosomy X from separation failure of chromosomes in either the parental gamete or during early embryonic divisions. The aetiology of Turner syndrome phenotype can be the result of haploinsufficiency, where a portion of critical genes are rendered inactive during embryogenesis. Normal ovarian development requires these vital regions of the X chromosome that are inactivated. Clinical manifestation include primary amenorrhea, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, streak gonads, infertility and failure to develop secondary sex characteristics. Turner Syndrome is not diagnosed until a delayed onset of puberty with M√ºllerian structures found to be in infantile stage. Physical phenotypic characteristics include short stature, dysmorphic features and lymphedema at birth. Comorbidities include heart defects, vision and hearing problems, diabetes and low thyroid hormone production. =Endocrine Disruptions= Endocrine disruptors interfere with the endocrine system and hormones. Hormones are critical for the correct events in embryogenesis to occur. Foetal development relies on the proper timing of the delivery of hormones for cellular differentiation and maturation. Disruptions can cause sexual development disorders leading to gonadal dysgenesis. Diagnosis Management History Turner syndrome was first described independently by Otto Ulrich in 1930 and Henry Turner in 1938. 46,XX pure gonadal dysgenesis was first reported in 1960. 46,XY pure gonadal dysgenesis, also known as Swyer syndrome, was first described by Gim Swyer in 1955.

Boyd was born in Coshocton, Ohio, and obtained a doctorate degree from the small University of Wooster, where he was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He began his career as a superintendent of the Van Wert, Ohio school system from 1880 to 1888 when he left and took over the Arkansas City, Kansas school system. While there, members of the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma came to his schools to view the heating system that Boyd had installed. The Board was impressed and chose him as the University's first president with a salary of $2,400. In addition to his role as University President, he also served as Professor of Mental and Moral Science, as he was a devout Presbyterian. He brought his religion with him to the university where he held chapel services each morning, which included Scripture readings and a brief three-minute sermon. Around the turn of the 20th century, Boyd was president of the territorial university as well as the territorial Board of Education, making him the most prominent man in education in the area. Shortly after arriving in Norman, Oklahoma, he began a project for which he since become best known. He began preparations for planting thousands of trees around campus, and began buying young trees from a bankrupt nursery in Wichita, Kansas. At first, the people of Norman were outraged, but when they learned Boyd was purchasing the trees and the water with his own money they became grateful. He reportedly planted nearly 10,000 trees in his first 18 months on the job and developed a campus nursery with more than 40,000 trees. After the Oklahoma Territory became the State of Oklahoma, one of the first acts of the new Oklahoma Governor, Charles N. Haskell, was to replace many of the original faculty at the University. This included Boyd as well as Vernon Louis Parrington, the Harvard-educated professor who started the English Department and went on to win a Pulitzer Prize. The Governor accused Boyd of being an \\"aristocrat, not democratic enough.\\" Upon leaving the University of Oklahoma, he became the president of the University of New Mexico in 1912. He died on November 17, 1936, aged 83.

The Bishop of Down and Connor Henry Henry invited the Redemptorists religious order to come to Belfast in 1896. Initially they built a small tin church in the grounds of Clonard House in 1897. In 1890 a monastery was opened in these grounds in the early French Gothic style and in 1911 the Church of the Holy Redeemer opened in the grounds and replaced the tin church. https://discovernorthernireland.com/Clonard-Monastery- Belfast-P8220/ Religious devotion Over the years the monastery promoted a range of initiatives in religious devotion. One of the earliest was the establishment of confraternities for men and women. These involved a combination of religious services and instruction and were extremely popular. However, due to declining numbers the women's confraternity ceased to function in 2019 although the men's organisation continues. It continues to hold an annual Novena which attracts over 100,000 pilgrims, Catholic and Protestant, from across Ireland. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/martin-obrien- an-oasis-of-calm-in-a-tumultuous-world-what-draws-the-crowds-to-clonard- novena-38232385.htmlhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18513238 Clonard and The Troubles Clonard has been on the frontline of the troubles which erupted in Belfast in 1969. The monastery is located at an Interface area between the mainly Catholic Falls Road district and the mainly Protestant Shankill Road district. At the rear of the monastery was located Bombay Street and Cupar Street which led on to the Shankill Road. On 14 August 1969, loyalist mobs from the Shankill Road launched a series of attacks on the houses owned by Catholics in those streets. The residents were forced to flee and many of the houses were burnt to the ground including the whole of Bombay Street. The priests from Clonard were actively involved from the outset in attempting to safeguard the local residents. Two of Northern Ireland's most significant clergy who worked for peace Frs. Alec Reid and Gerry Reynolds lived here.https://cruxnow.com/wmf-ireland/2018/08/16/redemptorist-monastery- in-belfast-looms-as-icon-of-hope-for-troubled-city/ Contemporary Pastoral Outreach In 1981 members of the Redemptorist community at Clonard established links with Fitzroy Presbyterian Church near Queen's University, Belfast in the south of the city and the monastery became a centre for peacemaking and reconciliation. Secret conversations between John Hume and Gerry Adams were held in rooms in the complex while wider, interfaith conversations helped contribute to the 1994 IRA ceasefire.

It lies between Builth and Hay-on-Wye, approximately 3 miles from the Wales-England border today.  Early history The first castle would appear to have been built by Pain fitzJohn. The site was probably what remained of a much earlier Roman fort, so naturally defensible. The ground plan is rectangular and Roman artifacts have been found at the site. Pain fitzJohn was killed by a Welsh raiding party in 1137 and Elfael in which Painscastle stands, was taken over by the native Welsh ruler, Madog ab Idnerth. Recapture & Refortification  The castle remained in Welsh hands until about 1195 when the area was captured by William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber, who refortified the castle. His formidable wife Maud de Braose, also known as Matilda, held Painscastle against the Welsh for a few months.  Welsh sieges  In 1196 Rhys ap Gruffudd of Deheubarth defeated the Marcher Lords in a battle at Radnor 8 miles to the north and also besieged Painscastle, but did not actually take it as terms were agreed. In 1198 Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys raised a large army to besiege the castle, but was heavily defeated by an army led by the Justiciar, Geoffrey fitz Peter. This English army formed at nearby Hay on Wye.  Baronial conflict  William de Braose fell out with king John of England in 1208 and was forced to flee the kingdom. King John held his lands and castles until Painscastle was apparently occupied by Iorwerth Clud, a Welsh de Braose ally, in 1215. He submitted to King John in 1216 and was granted the Lordship of Elfael until his death in 1222. The Welsh then transferred their allegiance back to Llywelyn ap Iorwerth and the castle was attacked and destroyed by the Welsh.  Campaign against Llywelyn the Great  In 1231 the castle was rebuilt in stone by King Henry III of England and Hubert de Burgh as part of a campaign against Llywelyn the Great. In 1233 the castle was claimed by Ralph Tosny, whose family held it until the castle was taken by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd from Roger Tosny in 1265. Another Ralph Tosny was able to recover and rebuild it in 1276. It later passed to the Beauchamp dynasty's hands, Earls of Warwick.  Owain Glynd≈µr  Painscastle was refortified yet again at the time of the Welsh rebellion led by Owain Glynd≈µr in 1401 while under the Beauchamps for the King, Henry IV.  Today  Little now remains of the castle other than the massive earthworks.

Described as a \\"bizarre cult,\\" the seven were arrested and charged with terrorism- related offenses in 2006 after a Federal Bureau of Investigation sting investigation. The members of the group operated out of a small warehouse in the Miami neighborhood of Liberty City. Indicted in federal court, three trials of the Liberty City Seven defendants took place. One defendant was acquitted in the first trial, but the jury deadlocked on the other six defendants and a mistrial occurred. The second trial also resulted in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial. On the third trial of the remaining six defendants, five were convicted on some of the counts, including the group's leader, Narseal Batiste, the only defendant to be convicted on all four charges. One more defendant was acquitted of all charges in the third trial. The charges centered on the group's belief that they were being offered money by someone in Yemen to help their mission in Liberty City, provided they supported the al-Qaeda jihad. The FBI agents represented themselves as representatives of al-Qaeda, and persuaded Batiste to provide plans for a stated intention to destroy the Sears Tower in Chicago, the FBI field office in Miami, and other targets. Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation John S. Pistole described the group's plot as more \\"aspirational than operational\\"; the group did not have the means to carry out attacks on such targets. The group had no weapons and did not seek weapons when they were offered. The group had no communication with any actual al-Qaeda or other terrorist operatives. Views and beliefs The groups held idiosyncratic syncretic views. Juan Cole wrote that: Followers wore uniforms bearing a Star of David and met for Bible study and martial arts practice. Investigation and arrest Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said in 2006 that the men had been taped promising to fight a \\"full ground war against the United States.\\" The seven were arrested on June 23, 2006. On June 22, 2006, a grand jury indicted the seven men. They were arrested during an FBI raid on the run- down warehouse in Liberty City, Miami in which the group met. The seven men named in the indictment: *Narseal Batiste, a/k/a Brother Naz, a/k/a Prince Manna - Considered the ringleader. *Patrick Abraham, 29, a/k/a Brother Pat *Stanley Grant Phanor, 33, a/k/a Brother Sunni (although actually nicknamed \\"Sunny\\") *Rotschild Augustine, 25, a/k/a Brother Rot *Burson Augustin, 24, a/k/a Brother B *Naudimar Herrera, 25, a/k/a Brother Naudy *Lyglenson Lemorin, 33, a/k/a Brother Levi, a/k/a Brother Levi-El Five were U.S. citizens, one a legal immigrant from Haiti, and the last an illegal alien originally from Haiti. They were accused of planning to levy a \\"full ground war\\" against the United States. Also involved was Charles James Stewart of the Moorish Science Temple in Chicago, a convicted rapist who was paid through the FBI informant to join the group in April. He subsequently shot one of Batiste's followers and then became a witness against him and his supporters. The two FBI informants, both Middle Eastern-born, were known as CW1, a Miami resident who had previous arrests for assault and marijuana possession, and CW2, who had worked for the FBI for six years and was awaiting approval of his petition for political asylum in the United States. Narseal Batiste (also known by some as \\"Prinze Nas\\"), 32, is a father of four and a martial arts enthusiast, who had been a member of the Guardian Angels in Chicago. The indictments accused the seven of being a domestic terrorist cell who plotted to blow up the Sears Tower and the FBI building in Miami and had contact with al-Qaeda to attempt a bombing of Sears Tower. Although no links to outside terrorist groups were alleged, nor any weapons found, the arrests were the subject of a high level press briefing in Washington D.C. hosted by the Attorney-General and made headline news in Europe the following day. The Director of the FBI Robert Mueller cited the incident in a \\"Major Executive Speech\\" in Cleveland that afternoon entitled \\"Protecting America from Terrorist Attack: The Threat of Homegrown Terrorism\\". According to the indictments, the group had been infiltrated for nearly a year by two paid FBI informants posing as al-Qaeda members. The warehouse they were in had been wired for surveillance and provided rent-free by the FBI since January, and members of the group discussed the terrorist plots with the undercover agents present while smoking marijuana. Differences had broken out in April between the leaders, causing one to be arrested for shooting a follower of the other. Trials The seven men charged in the terror plot. All seven were denied bail since their arrest. Their trial began on 2 October 2007 with the threat of up to 70 years in prison if convicted of all charges, and ended on 13 December with one defendant acquitted and the jury unable to return a verdict on the other six, for whom a retrial was scheduled for 7 January 2008. On April 16, 2008, the federal judge in the case declared a second mistrial for the six remaining defendants after the jury had been deadlocked for 13 days.AP article The presiding judge for all three trials was Joan A. Lenard. The first trial began on October 2, 2007 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Prosecutors presented evidence drawn from 15,000 FBI recordings, including one in which Narseal Batiste said they would make sure no one survived destruction of the 110-story Sears Tower, and another which features ceremony in which each member of the group swears allegiance to al- Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. The defense claimed that the men played along with the talk by the FBI informants of terrorist plots in the hope of obtaining money, and that they never constituted a credible terrorist threat. In the second week of the trial two of the jurors were dismissed after a police counter-terrorism pamphlet was found in the jury room. The defense rested its case on November 20, 2007. The prosecution alleged that although the defendants did not have the means to carry out a terrorist attack, they \\"were a ready-made terrorist cell here for al-Qaeda\\" who sought to use their attacks on the Sears Tower to spark an insurrection, topple the government, and bring about the destruction of the United States. The first trial ended on December 13, 2007. Lyglenson Lemorin was acquitted of all charges, and on the other six the jury deadlocked, leading to a mistrial. The defense argument was that the men were playing along with the FBI agents in order to con for money. On December 13, 2007, after nine days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Lyglenson Lemorin, who had left the group and moved to Atlanta months before the arrests but were unable to reach a verdict on the other six. The judge declared a mistrial, and the jury for a retrial was scheduled to be picked after 7 January 2008. Lemorin was acquitted of these charges. Although Lemorin was acquitted in December 2007 and had never been convicted of a crime, he continued to be detained pending a deportation proceeding in which the same charges were reexamined. Deportation is considered a civil proceeding, where double jeopardy protections do not apply and a lower standard of clear and convincing evidence is used rather than reasonable doubt. This reference quotes the Miami Herald story no longer available online. After being jailed as a threat to national security for three years in Georgia, Florida, and Louisiana by immigration authorities, he was deported to Haiti on January 20, 2011 while his appeal to an Atlanta federal court was pending. The following April, Lemorin was not permitted to return for the funeral of the 15-year-old son he had fathered in the United States, who remained in the U.S. and was struck while trying to push a stalled vehicle off the highway. A second trial ended on April 16, 2008, when Lenard declared a mistrial after the second jury reported they were deadlocked after 13 days of deliberations. A third trial ended on May 12, 2009, when following two weeks of deliberation a jury acquitted Naudimar Herrera, but convicted the five remaining defendants. During the deliberations two of the jurors were replaced. Ringleader Batiste was convicted on all four charges brought against him. Abraham was convicted on three of the four counts against him. Phanor, Augustine, and Augustin were convicted on two counts of providing material support for terrorism. The five were sentenced on November 20, 2009 by Judge Joan Lenard after a three-day sentencing hearing: *Narseal Batiste: 162 months in prison, followed by 35 years of supervised release; *Patrick Abraham: 112.5 months in prison followed by 15 years of supervised release; *Stanley Grant Phanor: 96 months in prison followed by 15 years of supervised release; *Burson Augustin: 72 months in prison followed by 10 years of supervised release; and *Rothschild Augustine: 84 months in prison followed by 10 years of supervised release. Members Batiste was the leader of the group. He is married and he and his wife Minerva have three boys and a girl. Batiste's relatives described him as a \\"Moses- like\\" figure who roamed his neighborhood wearing a robe and carrying a crooked wooden cane as he recruited young men, based his teachings on those of the Moorish Science Temple of America. Batiste once drove a FedEx truck in Chicago and was a member of the volunteer Guardian Angels, an anti-crime group. His father, Narcisse Batiste, sister and two of his brothers are Christian ministers. His mother Audrey Batiste died in 2000. According to the indictment, Batiste told an FBI informant posing as an al-Qaeda member around December 16, 2005 that he was organizing a mission to build an \\"Islamic Army\\" in order to wage jihad against the United States with his \\"soldiers\\" to destroy the Sears Tower. He requested a list of materials and equipment needed to wage jihad, including boots, uniforms, machine guns, radios, and vehicles. Around December 22, 2005, he provided said \\"al-Qaeda representative\\" with shoe sizes of his \\"soldiers\\" and received military boots a week later. Around that same time he requested radios, binoculars, bulletproof vests, vehicles and $50,000 cash. On February 19, 2006, in a meeting with the \\"al-Qaeda representative,\\" along with Patrick Abraham, he expressed interest in attending al-Qaeda training during April and gave further details of the mission to wage \\"a full ground war\\" against the United States in order to \\"kill all the devils we can\\" in a mission that would \\"be just as good or greater than 9/11.\\" He requested a video camera for the trip to Chicago. Around March 10, 2006 he along with Lyglenson Lemorin met with the FBI plant in Miami-Dade County, Florida and swore fealty to al-Qaeda. Around March 16, 2006, along with Patrick Abraham, Stanley Phanor, Naudimar Herrera, Burson Augustin, Lyglenson Lemorin, and Rotschild Augustine, Batiste met with the \\"al-Qaeda representative,\\" swore an oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda and discussed plans to bomb the FBI building in five cities. At this meeting, Batiste took possession of a video camera and promised to obtain \\"good footage\\" of the North Miami Beach FBI building. Around March 23, 2006, Batiste asked the FBI informant for a rental van for himself and his conspirators to take reconnaissance footage of the FBI building. Around March 24, 2006, Patrick Abraham drove Batiste by car by the FBI and the National Guard Armory buildings in Miami-Dade, Florida. Around the same date, they traveled with the \\"al-Qaeda representative\\" to purchase a digital camera. Around March 26, 2006, Batiste and Burson Augustin provided the FBI informant with photographs and video footage of the FBI building and the James Lawrence King Federal Justice Building, federal courthouse, Federal Detention Center, and the Miami Police Department buildings. They met again around April 6 to discuss the photographs and footage. Around May 24, 2006, Batiste told the \\"al-Qaeda representative\\" that he was experiencing delays because of various problems within his organization but that he wanted to continue his mission and maintain his relationship with al-Qaeda. Press coverage of the arrests The arrests were announced on 23 June at a high level press briefing in Washington D.C. by the Attorney-General Alberto Gonzales, the Deputy Director of the FBI John S. Pistole, and an Assistant Attorney-General Alice S. Fisher. At the press conference, the Attorney-General and the Deputy Director took questions from reporters: :Question: Did any of the men have any actual contact with any members of al-Qaeda that you know of? :Attorney-General: The answer to that is \\"No\\". :Question: Did they have any means to carry out this plot? I mean, did you find any explosives, weapons? :Attorney-General: You raise a good point ... We took action when we had enough evidence. :Question: Was there anything against the Sears Tower other than this one apparent, just, kind of mention of the Sears Tower? It doesn't look like they ever took pictures or ... :Deputy Director of the FBI: One of the individuals was familiar with the Sears Tower, had worked in Chicago, and was familiar with the tower. But in terms of the plans, it was more aspirational than operational. He assured the public that the men posed no actual danger because their plot had been caught in \\"its earliest stages\\", and that the group's only source of money and weapons would have been the undercover FBI agent. The following week the incident was featured on The Daily Show, where Jon Stewart quipped: \\"Now, I am not a general. I don't have any association with any military academy. But I believe that if you are going to wage a full ground war against the United States, you need to field at least as many people as, say, a softball team.\\" Democracy Now interviewed two community activists in Miami on 26 June who summed up local reaction to the indictments: In his afternoon speech, the Director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, cited the case to illustrate how his department's policies were working. He also made reference to the case of Kevin James, the Toledo terror plot, and the 2006 Toronto terrorism case. FBI payments * The first informant, CW1, received $10,500 for his services and $8,815 in expenses. * The second informant, CW2, received $17,000 and approval of his petition for political asylum in the United States. * Expenses for Charles James Stewart and his wife to travel from Chicago to Miami came to $3,500 * Rent paid on the warehouse used for training from January to June.

Family background Wang Jian came from one of the most powerful noble families of the Southern Dynasties‚Äîthe clan of the Jin prime minister Wang Dao. His grandfather Wang Tanshou (ÁéãÊõáÈ¶ñ) was one of the most trusted officials of Emperor Wen of Liu Song, and his father Wang Sengchuo (ÁéãÂÉßÁ∂Ω) was an important official late in Emperor Wen's reign as well. As Wang Sengchuo was involved in Emperor Wen's decision-making process in whether to depose his crown prince Liu Shao, Liu Shao, after assassinating Emperor Wen in 453, had Wang Sengchuo killed, and Wang Jian was raised by his uncle Wang Sengqian (ÁéãÂÉßËôî). Wang Jian inherited the title that Liu Shao's brother Emperor Xiaowu posthumously honored Wang Sengchuo with‚ÄîMarquess of Yuzhang. Service during Liu Song Because of Wang Jian's noble birth and because he became known for studiousness in his youth, Yuan Can, the mayor of the capital Jiankang under Emperor Xiaowu's brother Emperor Ming recommended him to be the husband of Emperor Ming's daughter, Princess Yangxian. However, Emperor Ming felt that because Wang Sengchuo's wife Liu Ying'e (ÂäâËã±Â®•) the Princess Dongyang (who was not Wang Jian's mother) was involved in the witchcraft carried out by Liu Shao, she should not be his daughter's mother-in-law, he wanted to disinter Princess Dongyang's body from her joint tomb with Wang Sengchuo. Wang Jian pleaded that this not be carried out‚Äîstating that he would rather die‚Äîand Emperor Ming did not insist. During Emperor Ming's reign, he was repeatedly promoted, although was never among the upper echelon of officials. After Emperor Ming died in 472 and was succeeded by his violent and arbitrary son Emperor Houfei, Wang became fearful and requested that Yuan, who was then in charge of the government along with Chu Yuan, make him a commandery governor. Yuan made him the governor of Yixing Commandery (Áæ©Ëàà, roughly modern Wuxi, Jiangsu). After the general Xiao Daocheng assassinated Emperor Houfei in 477, and effectively took over the government, Wang was recalled to the capital in 478. Wang could see what Xiao wanted to do next‚Äîtake over the throne‚Äîand he was the only nobleman who actively sought to assist Xiao in doing so, and he carried out the planning for the various steps that Xiao would take in taking over. In 479, Xiao was able to take over from Emperor Houfei's brother Emperor Shun, ending Liu Song and starting Southern Qi, as its Emperor Gao. Service during Southern Qi For Wang Jian's contributions during his takeover, Emperor Gao created him the Duke of Nanchang. Even though Emperor Gao made Chu Yuan prime minister, Wang appeared to have more actual power. He often compared himself to the Jin prime minister Xie An, praising Xie for his elegant style. In 479, Emperor Gao wanted to institute a universal identification card program in Jiankang to keep social order, but Wang persuaded him of its impracticality. In 482, when Emperor Gao died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Wu, Wang and Chu were the two officials that Emperor Gao entrusted the new emperor to (however, Emperor Wu was older than Wang). Emperor Wu continued to entrust Wang with great responsibilities within his administration, particularly after Chu died later in 482. Because of how powerful Wang was, his uncle Wang Sengqian, not wanting too much attention toward one household, repeatedly turned down promotions, and further advised Wang Jian not to be overly wasteful at his mansion. In 484, Wang Jian advised Emperor Wu to reduce the power of four secretaries that he had, and while Emperor Wu took the unusual step of personally writing a letter to Wang Jian to explain himself, he did not follow Wang's advice in this matter, and at one point, Wang lamented that while he was prime minister, his power was not as great as one of these secretaries, Ru Faliang (ËåπÊ≥ï‰∫Æ). However, it was also said that anyone that Wang recommended for post was immediately commissioned by Emperor Wu. At some point during Emperor Gao or Emperor Wu's reign, Wang also took on the secondary responsibility of being the principal of the imperial university, and by 485, Emperor Wu had merged the imperial research facility Zongmingguan (Á∏ΩÊòéËßÄ) into the university, allowing Wang to have the school set up entirely within his own mansion. As Wang was also a Confucian scholar, it was said that from this point on, the university switched from a focus on literature to Confucianism. In 489, Wang Jian died.

The drug is manufactured by Pharmstandard (). Although some Russian studies have shown it to be effective, it is not approved by the US FDA for the treatment or prevention of influenza. Chemically, umifenovir features an indole core, functionalized at all but one positions with different substituents. The drug is claimed to inhibit viral entry into target cells and stimulate the immune response. Umifenovir is manufactured and made available as tablets, capsules and syrup.  Status  A packet of umifenovir capsules Testing of umifenovir's efficacy has mainly occurred in China and Russia, and it is well known in these two countries. Some of the Russian tests showed the drug to be effective and a direct comparison with oseltamivir showed similar efficiency in vitro and in a clinical setting. In 2010 Arbidol was the drug brand with the highest sales volume in Russia. In the first quarter of 2020 it had a 16 percent share in the Russian antiviral market.  Mode of action  = Biochemistry = Umifenovir inhibits membrane fusion of influenza virus. Umifenovir prevents contact between the virus and target host cells. Fusion between the viral envelope (surrounding the viral capsid) and the cell membrane of the target cell is inhibited. This prevents viral entry to the target cell, and therefore protects it from infection. Some evidence suggests that the drug's actions are more effective at preventing infections from RNA viruses than infections from DNA viruses. As well as specific antiviral action against both influenza A and influenza B viruses, umifenovir exhibits modulatory effects on the immune system. The drug stimulates a humoral immune response, induces interferon-production, and stimulates the phagocytic function of macrophages. = Clinical application = Umifenovir is used primarily as an antiviral treatment for influenza. The drug has also been investigated as a candidate drug for treatment of hepatitis C. More recent studies indicate that umifenovir also has in vitro effectiveness at preventing entry of Zaire ebolavirus (Kikwit strain), Tacaribe arenavirus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus in mammalian cell cultures, while confirming umifenovir's suppressive effect in vitro on Hepatitis B and poliovirus infection of mammalian cells when introduced either in advance of viral infection or during infection.  Research  , umifenovir and darunavir were being studied as a potential combination treatment for COVID-19 in China.  Side effects  Side effects in children include sensitization to the drug. No known overdose cases have been reported and allergic reactions are limited to people with hypersensitivity. The is more than 4 g/kg.  Criticism  In 2007, the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences stated that the effects of Arbidol (umifenovir) are not scientifically proven. Russian media criticized lobbying attempts by Tatyana Golikova (then-Minister of Healthcare) to promote umifenovir, and the unproven claim that Arbidol can speed up recovery from flu or cold by 1.3-2.3 days. They also debunked claims that the efficacy of umifenovir is supported by peer-reviewed studies.

Mark II sidevalve engine. Chang Jiang () is the transcribed brand name of motorcycles that were once manufactured by the China Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Company. It takes its name from the Chang Jiang River, also known as the Yangtze or, in English, the Long River. CJ750 The CJ750 motorcycle is based on the original 1956 Soviet IMZ (Irbitski Mototsikletniy Zavod) M-72 which itself was derived from the earlier German 1938 BMW R71. Nearly all of them have sidecars. They are often erroneously referred to as BMW \\"replicas\\" when in fact, they are derivatives of the IMZ M-72. Production began in the late 1950s or early 1960s. (Different sources cite different dates.) They were originally produced for the Chinese military and are powered by an air-cooled, four-stroke, opposed flat-twin engine displacing 746cc. The rear wheel is shaft-driven. The most common models are: The M1 which has a sidevalve (flathead) engine and a 6V electrical system. This model is a clone of the M72 and closely resembles the 1938 BMW R71. The M1M is also a sidevalve, however it uses a 12V electrical system and is equipped with a reverse gear. It also has an electric starter where the M1 has only a kick-starter. These enhancements were designed with the help of German engineers. The M1S (or \\"Super\\") uses an overhead-valve engine, 12V electrical system, electric starter and reverse gear. The OHV system is fundamentally of German BMW design. All three models use the same frame and sheet metal. The M1 and M1M are nearly identical in appearance, but they can be distinguished by observing certain details. CJ technological history includes racing bikes, experimental engines and futile attempts at modernizing the appearance of a long obsolete machine. Beginning in the mid-1980s, over a decade after the normalization of relations between China and the USA, China opened its markets to foreign motorcycle manufacturers which expedited the end of CJ750 mass production. Today, the marque is kept alive by interest from foreign hobbyists. History The CJ750 originated with the 1938 BMW R71, then, by way of the Soviet IMZ M72, found its way to China as the Chang Jiang. Early Production In 1950, the Peoples Liberation Army Beijing No. 6 Automotive Works developed a military motorcycle by reverse engineering a German Zundapp KS500 motorcycle. The Zundapp-based machine entered production in 1951. 4,248 were built before military motorcycle production was transferred to the Hongdu and Xingjiang machinery plants. Both factories remain subsidiaries of the state-run aeronautics industry to this day. By the mid-1950s, the Soviets considered the M72 to be obsolete. China would soon acquire all the tooling and produce their own M72s. In light of this, the Zundapp-based machine was abandoned. The Chinese M72 was named the Chang Jiang 750. According to some sources, it entered production in November, 1957 at the state-owned Ganjiang machinery factory. Early production used Russian M72 parts. Early CJs were nearly identical to M72s. The Chang Jiang drivetrain has been revised several times since production began. From 1957-66, CJs were equipped with so-called Type I engines and transmissions. This drivetrain was almost identical to those of the R71 and M72. In September, 1966, production of the Type II engine and gearbox began. It was not until 1972 that the Type II engine replaced the Type I in general use. Continued use of the Type I engine in 1966-72 was the result of a surplus of Type I components. With so many Type I engines in use, parts remained in production until the early seventies. When the military serviced Type I bikes, they would replace the engines and/or gearboxes with Type II components. This was done for ease of maintenance, parts availability, and improved engine characteristics. Bikes with Type I engines often had their original gearboxes replaced with a Type II. Engines manufactured with a serial number of 661802 and higher are Type II. In the 1960s, the factory was renamed the State-Owned Changjiang Machinery Factory. In 1969, the CJ750 underwent some minor design changes, primarily related to sidecar frames and headlight-mounted switches. Gas tanks with built-in tool boxes appeared around this time. In the late-1970s, the factory was merged with airplane manufacturer Guo Ying Hongdu Ji Xie Chang. At this time, a 6V OHV engine with 30 horsepower was being developed. Only a few of these engines can be found today. They were quickly replaced with a 12V, 32 horsepower version. In December, 1980, a small number of 900 cc, OHV engines were produced in response to the acquisition of BMW motorcycles by the armed police. Only a handful of these machines were built, probably less than ten. Only a few 900 cc engines have been found. Modern production The 750 OHV upgrade appeared in the mid-eighties and entered production at the Ministry of Aviation and Space Engine Factory in Nanfang, Hunan Province. This marked the introduction of the M1S model. In 1986, the M1 model was upgraded with a 12V electrical system and a gearbox with reverse, and designated the M1M.

The team has produced many famous international stars such as Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Hao Zhihua, Huang Qiuyan, Zhang Hongmei and Wu Jing. The Beijing team members also work with movie producers to make films. Aside from Jet Li, many other athletes have also been featured in movies (e.g. Wang Jue has starred in Shaolin Temple.) Every year, the Beijing Team performs demonstrations of wushu for the citizens of Beijing as well as visiting dignitaries. They have performed for former US President Jimmy Carter as well as many other foreign heads of state when they visited Beijing. History The Beijing Wushu Team was founded in November 1974 by Wu Bin and Li Junfeng as a successor to the Beijing Wushu School. The Beijing Wushu School was created in order to prepare the city of Beijing for the first All China Games. Beijing Sports University (now Beijing Physical Education University) wushu department graduate Liu Peiwei was appointed team leader and coach. After the first All China Games, the team found a home at the Beihai Sports Center, with Liu Peiwei serving as the first director. In 1963, Beijing Sports University graduate Wu Bin came to the school as a coach, bringing new vitality into the sports school and establishing the foundation for the Beijing Team's later success. In the nearly three decades since its founding, and through the hard work of the athletes and coaches, the team has achieved remarkable levels of success. From 1974 to 1997, they won the National team championship 11 times. From 1975 to 1985, the Beijing Wushu Team achieved a feat that no team has ever accomplished, before or since - winning the championship for ten consecutive years. The Beijing Wushu Team received 40 individual gold medals during this 10-year reign. Many of the earlier generations of Beijing Wushu Team athletes have gone on to teach wushu abroad. Many have emigrated to the US, Australia, Japan and other parts of Asia.

Publication history Haywire was originally a character from the Squadron Supreme limited series from Marvel Comics. Fictional character biography Haywire (Harold Danforth) has the ability to create and project strands of 5mm diameter metallic \\"tanglewires\\". These wires can be created at some distance from his body, and disappear if he loses consciousness. Haywire was a member of Nighthawk's group of freedom fighters, the Redeemers, whose purpose was to overthrow the government controlled by the Squadron Supreme. During this time he was romantically involved with fellow Redeemer Inertia.Squadron Supreme #10 Haywire was one of the Redeemers who joined the Squadron Supreme as a double agent in order to sabotage their efforts at world conquest. He accompanied Lamprey and the Whizzer on a tour of the hibernacle, and then led Lamprey into Redeemers headquarters for deprogramming.Squadron Supreme #11 With his fellow Redeemers, Haywire fought the Squadron, forcing them to end their dictatorship over the United States of \\"Other-Earth\\". Haywire battled the Whizzer during the huge battle. After the battle, some of the surviving Redeemers joined the Squadron Supreme, including Haywire.Squadron Supreme #12 Haywire worked with fellow Squadron members to prevent the destruction of their universe by the Nth Man. Haywire witnesses the grisly death of his girlfriend Inertia at the hands of the Nth Man.Squadron Supreme Graphic Novel: Death of a Universe Because of the events of that encounter, the Squadron Supreme became stranded on \\"mainstream\\" Earth. They relocated to Project: Pegasus headquarters. Alongside the Shape, Haywire was mind-controlled by the Over-Mind into battling Quasar to cover the Over- Mind's escape from Earth.Quasar #13 Haywire participated in Doctor Strange's failed attempt to return the Squadron to their own Earth.Quasar #19 When the rest of the Squadron finally did return home, Haywire chose to remain on Marvel-Earth.Squadron Supreme: New World Order Sometime later, Haywire happened across a battle between Thanos of Titan (self-styled god of death) and Mantis (also known as the Celestial Madonna), as Thanos attempted to destroy Quoi, her child (destined to become the Celestial Messiah). Haywire tried to help Mantis and eventually, Mantis elicited help from Haywire and an assemblage of Avengers in defeating Thanos's efforts to kill her son. In the process, Haywire hoped to encounter the cosmic embodiment of Death in order to bid it to restore Inertia to life. Ultimately, Haywire got his chance, but Death did not respond to his pleas. Distraught and obsessed, Haywire leapt into the form of Death itself and was destroyed. Powers and abilities Haywire had the ability to psionically generate a steel-like \\"tanglewire\\" filament from his fingertips which he can use for a variety of purposes, including creating long grappling wires for locomotion, vast quantities for trapping, entangling, or binding his opponents, or forming simple shapes like spheres, cubes, and cones. The tanglewire can be sharp or safe, according to his will. The tanglewire is extremely tensile and durable; only omnium and adamantium can cut through it. The tanglewire is resistant to extremes of temperature and pressure. The tanglewire will remain in existence indefinitely or until he consciously wills it to dissipate, and will remain in existence if he is rendered unconscious. There is no known limit to the amount of tanglewire he can generate. He wears padded leather gloves to enable him to hold onto his tanglewire when necessary. Haywire was an athletic man, who was coached in hand-to-hand combat by Nighthawk, and later by his fellow Squadron Supreme members. He was skilled in lock picking and guitar playing.

The college provides advice to those responsible for training and certifying psychiatrists in the UK. In addition to publishing many books and producing several journals, the College produces, for the public, information about mental health problems. Its offices are located at 21 Prescot Street in London, near Aldgate. The College was formerly located in Belgrave Square. History The College has existed in various forms since 1841, having started life as the Association of Medical Officers of Asylums and Hospitals for the Insane.Bewley (2008), p. 10. In 1865 it became the Medico-Psychological Association.Bewley (2008), p. 2. In 1926, the Association received its Royal Charter, becoming the Royal Medico-Psychological Association. Finally, in 1971, a Supplemental Charter accorded the Association the status of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Membership Several grades of membership are available: * Members use the post-nominal letters MRCPsych. * Affiliateship offers psychiatrists in the UK, who are not in training grades or substantive consultant posts, the opportunity of involvement with the College. * Specialist Associateship of the College is open to registered medical practitioners working in the United Kingdom and who meet certain criteria. * Fellowship use the post-nominal letters FRCPsych. Fellowship is awarded to a Member who has made a significant and distinctive contribution to psychiatry. It is not normally awarded until the nominee has held the Membership for a minimum of ten years. The process by which Members be awarded Fellowship of the College is that they should be nominated, proposed and seconded by two Members of the College. *International Associateship may be awarded to psychiatrists with five years' experience in psychiatry who do not hold the MRCPsych, but who hold a specialist qualification in psychiatry and who reside outside the UK. Coat of arms The coat of arms incorporates the traditional serpent-entwined rod of Asclepius symbolic of medicine, and butterflies associated with Psyche. Previous to the grant of these arms, the Medico-Psychological Association had used a device showing the seated Psyche with butterfly's wings. The arms were originally granted to the Royal Medico-Psychological Association in 1926, and were confirmed to the College on its formation in 1971 by the College of Arms. They were also registered in Scotland by the Court of the Lord Lyon. College Centre for Quality Improvement The work of the College Centre for Quality Improvement (CCQI) has developed a role for clinicians and their professional bodies in raising standards. Its national initiatives engage directly with clinicians, managers and service users and support them to take responsibility for improving local mental health services.

Early life He was born in Port Pirie on 14 March 1892, the first child of William Reed and his wife Elizabeth, n√©e Lathlean. William Reed was a Wesleyan clergyman, and Geoffrey was educated at Prince Alfred College, a Methodist school. Reed studied Law at the University of Adelaide and was admitted as a solicitor and barrister on 25 April 1914. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 18 February 1918, and was married later the same year to Kathleen Matthews. He was posted to England and France and served with a supply depot. He was discharged in Adelaide on 21 May 1919. Through the 1920s and 1930s, Reed became a partner in McLachlan, Reed & Griffiths, was active in the Law Society of South Australia and lectured in law at the University of Adelaide. He chaired a Royal Commission on transport in 1937, and in August 1938 was appointed King's Counsel. He was appointed to the Supreme Court of South Australia in 1943, having acted as judge for a period earlier. ASIO Reed was involved in security, including chairing the South Australian National Security Advisory Committee from 1941. He undertook a number of inquiries on security issues for the Federal Government. Reed was appointed as Commonwealth Director-General of Security on 2 March 1949. A fortnight later, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was established. The Australian Government of Ben Chifley was pressured by its allies to address security shortcomings at the beginning of the Cold War. In late 1943 Judge Reed was commissioned by Attorney General Dr H.V. Evatt to conduct an inquiry into the competence of Lt. Colonel Robert ( Bob) Wake who was in charge of the Commonwealth Security Service in Queensland. Serious charges had been made by the Army's Commander-in-chief, General Thomas Blamey, that Wake was an incompetent, used \\"lewd\\" women as agents and had lost the trust of Australia's American allies. Judge Reed found that all charges were false and when Prime Minister Chifley told him that Wake was the government's preferred choice to run ASIO, Judge Reed was very happy to work with Wake. Wake was the operational head of ASIO from its formation until Reed retired. Wake was responsible for appointing key agents to spy on the Russian Club in Sydney that eventually led to the Petrov Defection. During the formation of ASIO Wake worked very closely with the MI5 liaison officer, Courtney Young, who took snuff and wore spats. ASIO was modeled on the British equivalent, MI5. Its first authorised telephone interceptions were in June 1949, followed in July by a raid on the Sydney office of the Communist Party of Australia. Reed and ASIO were supported by the new Prime Minister, Robert Menzies after the 1949 election and he received warm tributes at the end of his post in July 1950 from both sides of politics. Reed returned to the Supreme Court of South Australia and was knighted in 1953 Coronation Honours List. He chaired a Royal Commission in electoral boundaries in 1955 and served as acting Governor of South Australia twice in 1957. In 1959, he was judge in the controversial trial of Max Stuart, an Aborigine accused of murdering a 9-year-old girl and subsequently also appointed to the Royal Commission into the conviction. Reed retired from the court in 1962 and retired in Adelaide after some travel overseas. He died on 31 December 1970 and was cremated. He was survived by his wife and their son and daughter.

Because of this, he is considered one of the most important musicians of latin and Spanish rock. He is the oldest son of Dolly Gigliotti and Argentine jazz drummer Tito Alberti. Biography =General= He wanted to be an airpilot, but he couldn't make it because of his color blindness. Unlike his friends, he was never attracted by soccer and he preferred waterpolo and hockey instead, which he used to practice at River Plate, a few blocks away from his home. He started to practice drums driven by his father Tito Alberti. By 1981, Charly met the two men who became his bandmates for 15 years: Gustavo Cerati and Hector \\"Zeta\\" Bosio, together they formed Soda Stereo, one of the most prominent and influential Argentine rock bands of the last two decades. Soda Stereo recorded their first album by 1983, and reached fame by 1985 with their second album \\"Nada Personal\\" (Nothing personal), which became number 1 in charts in such countries as Argentina, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela. By 1987, Charly Alberti met Remo Belli, the CEO of Remo Drums, who decided to sponsor him as one of his top 5 drummers in the world; this relationship became not only professional but personal as well. Also, in 1987, Soda Stereo made a tour for Latin America that took them to Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, and of course, Argentina. There were 57 concerts in 41 cities and 300.000 people attended. By 1987, Alberti was named by several music experts as one of the most prominent drummers in Argentina and Latin America. In 1995 he was named the best Argentine drummer of that year by the AAM (Asociaci√≥n Argentina de M√∫sica - Argentine Music Association) Charly Alberti performing live with Soda Stereo in 2007 Soda Stereo then recorded \\"Signos\\" (Signs -1986), \\"Doble Vida\\" (Double life -1988), \\"Canci√≥n Animal\\" (Animal Song- 1990), \\"Dynamo\\" (1992) and \\"Sue√±o Stereo\\" (Stereo Dream-1995). In 1995, during an impasse of Soda Stereo that lasted 2 years, Alberti decided to make an album with his then girlfriend, Argentine supermodel Deborah del Corral; the project was named PLUM and edited an album that was released only in Argentina. By 1997, Soda Stereo got back together only to do a farewell mini tour that ended on Sep. 20th 1997 in Argentina. In 2007, 10 years after their last concert, Soda Stereo reunited for a tour that started on Oct.19th and finished on Dec. 21st. The tour was called \\"Me ver√°s volver\\" (You'll see me coming back) and took them to Mexico, Peru, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, USA, Argentina and Venezuela. In total, they gave 22 concerts and sold out in every location they went. Soda Stereo made 6 gigs in the Monumental Stadium of River Plate(Argentina) and broke the record that was held by The Rolling Stones in that country with 5 sold-out gigs in the same place. Each night they called around 60.000 people. After the tour, Gustavo Cerati, Zeta Bosio and Charly Alberti, came back to their solo careers. =Life after Soda Stereo= In 1996, Charly Alberti founded CybeRelations, a company dedicated to promote Apple Macintosh in Argentina. By 1997, Charly decided to expand the company's objectives and started developing applications for multimedia and Internet, mainly for the Hispanic market. By the end of that year, Alberti becomes one of the AppleMasters, the only Latin American in the group. Charly Alberti By 1998, Charly created the i-time, which was accepted and used as the new standard of time on the Internet. By the end of that year, he launched URL Magazine and URL Records, both projects dedicated to promote electronic music in Latin countries. In 1999, Cybrel launched yeyeye.com, a web site dedicated to promote music in Latin America. In July 2001, Charly received an invitation of the Spanish Crown to talk in a conference about the importance of the Spanish language on the Internet and technology in general. In 2003 Charly Alberti received an invitation from MTV Latin America to participate in a special performance for the Second Edition of the MTV Latin American Video Awards. The idea was putting together an \\"All Star band\\" of Latin American musicians that will be the biggest surprise of the evening. This experience woke up in Charly the desire to go back into music. After that, he returned to Argentina and by 2005, founded along with his brother Andr√©s, a new rock band: MOLE. The band members are: Charly Alberti (drums), Andr√©s Alberti (lead guitars), Sergio Bufi (Singer and 2nd guitar) and Ezequial Dasso (Chorus and Bass). The first album was released only in Argentina in April 2007 and was called simply MOLE; is expected to be released all over Latin America sometime in 2008. On March 26, 2008, MOLE won in the category of Best Album by a New Rock Band in the Gardel Awards.Charly Alberti Alberti lost his father, latin jazz drummer Tito Alberti, on March 25, 2009. He joined The Climate Project, the foundation led by Nobel laureate Al Gore, as its chief spokesman in Argentina on May 1.Sitemarca: Charly Alberti se suma a la Fundaci√≥n de Al Gore  Instruments  Since the beginning of his career, Charly used Remo drums and Zildjian cymbals. Since mid-2007, Charly Alberti has been using a Yamaha drum, breaking with its tradition of using brand Remo drums. However, Charly explained this by saying that Yamaha now provides a more rock sound and Remo are now spending more on drums for Jazz, this decision was made in conjunction Charly and Remo Belli, founder of Remo.

The huge lake is bounded by Starr and Zapata Counties on the Texas side of the international border and the municipality and city of Nueva Ciudad Guerrero on the Tamaulipas side. The reservoir was formed by the construction of the Falcon Dam to provide water conservation, irrigation, flood control, and hydroelectricity to the area. The dam was dedicated in October 1953 by Mexican President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The dam and lake are managed jointly by governments of the United States and Mexico through the International Boundary and Water Commission, which was established in 1889 to maintain the border, allocate river waters between the two nations, and provide for flood control and water sanitation. The lake is named after Mar√≠a Rita de la Garza Falc√≥n, for whom the town of Falcon (displaced by the creation of the reservoir) was named. Fish and plant life Falcon International Reservoir has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in the reservoir include largemouth bass, crappie, catfish, and channel catfish. The bass population is in decline, a factor which has reduced the number of fishermen and tourists coming to the lake. In 2012, Falcon Lake ranked first for bass in the United States; by 2014, the rank had dropped to number 12. Despite the threat of piracy, security on the lake has been enhanced to the point that State Representative Lyle Larson of San Antonio, a member of the House Committee on Culture, Recreation, and Tourism, declared Falcon Lake, \\"the safest park on the border.\\"Gabriela A. Trevi√±o, \\"Falcon Lake discussed at hearing: Declining bass population impacts ecosystem, number of tourists\\" (May 17, 2014) Laredo Morning Times, pp. 1, 10A Alligator gar, large and heavy fish with a long lifespan, feed on the largemouth bass and can survive through droughts. In 2009, restrictions were placed on the harvest of alligator gar, but some area residents maintain that no regulations should be in place and that the gar must be considered as if they were rats and be removed from the lake. On the shores of Falcon Lake are Texas wild olive (Cordia boissieri), Mexican oregano (Lippia graveolens), hibiscus, mesquite thickets, huisache (Vachellia farnesiana var. farnesiana) and prickly pear cactus (Opuntia spp.). Greater roadrunners, collared peccaries, white-tailed deer, and black-tailed jackrabbits also exist within the park. Recreation Falcon State Park is located between Falcon Heights, Texas, and Nueva Ciudad Guerrero, Tamaulipas, and is the southern end of a International Falcon Reservoir. The park's main activities include camping, swimming, fishing, water skiing, and boating, with a self-guided nature trail. Bass fishing is particularly popular on the lake. Piracy In May 2010, Los Zetas pirates on the lake claiming to be Mexican Federal Police committed at least three armed robberies. The pirates boarded U.S. boats and demanded either weapons, drugs, or money. Fear of robbery has since dissuaded U.S. fishers from the lake. In June 2010, U.S. authorities also revealed a plot by Los Zetas to destroy the Falcon Dam. On September 30, 2010, David Hartley and his wife Tiffany, from McAllen, Texas, were in Mexican waters riding jet skis back from Mexico when they were allegedly chased by two boats containing about six gunmen. The Zapata County Sheriff said the woman escaped and reported that her husband was shot. He is missing and feared dead. On October 12, 2010, Commander Rolando Flores, the lead Mexican investigator for the David Hartley disappearance case, was beheaded by Mexican drug cartel members and sent in a suitcase to the Mexican military.

She was the first female member of the U.S. Congress to ever die while holding office, and she and her husband, who had also died in office, were the first congressional wife and husband to both die while still in office.  Biography  Born in Wilson, Pennsylvania (later part of Clairton) on July 20, 1902, Vera Daerr was a daughter of John Daerr and Jennie Leasure Daerr. A student of the public and parochial schools in Duquesne, Pennsylvania during her formative years, she graduated from high school there, and went on to secure employment as a secretary for that community's steel mill. After marrying automobile dealer and teacher Frank Buchanan in 1929, she and her husband raised twin daughters. \\"Buchanan, Vera Daerr,\\" in \\"History, Art & Archives,\\" U.S. House of Representatives. In 1942, she helped her husband win the mayoral election in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. According to historians at the U.S. House of Representatives, as McKeesport's first lady, Vera Daerr Buchanan then initiated \\"a listening campaign to familiarize herself with the needs of constituents and began cultivating a support base for future election campaigns.\\" Four years later, her husband won the May 1946 special election, filling a vacancy left in the 79th Congress (1945‚Äì1947) Representative Samuel Weis's resignation. Serving as her husband's secretary during his five-year tenure, she was then tapped to fill his seat after her husband died suddenly on April 27, 1951. Running as a Democrat and garnering roughly 62 percent of the vote to defeat Clifford W. Flegal in the July 24, 1951 special election, Buchanan won and was subsequently sworn in to the 82nd United States Congress on August 1 by Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Reelected to the 83rd and 84th United States Congresses, she served until her death in McKeesport at the age of 53.\\"Buchanan, Vera Daerr,\\" in \\"History, Art & Archives,\\" U.S. House of Representatives. During her tenure, she served on the House Banking and Currency, Merchant Marine and Fisheries, and Public Works committees, but resigned from the Merchant Marine Committee in 1952 in order to devote more energy to the other two committee roles. She was supported in her efforts by her daughter Jane Buchanan, who served as her secretary.\\"Buchanan, Vera Daerr,\\" in \\"History, Art & Archives,\\" U.S. House of Representatives. Safe, affordable housing and affordable groceries for working people became two of her priorities, as did flood protection initiatives for her district.

Illness, death and interment During her third and final term in Congress, Buchanan was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Initially committed to working from her hospital bed at the Bethesda Naval Hospital when she received the diagnosis in June 1955, she continued to do so until she was forced by her failing health to move closer to home. Hospitalized for the final three months of her life at the McKeesport Hospital, she continued working for much of that time until she finally died on November 26, 1955.

He is famous as the composer of many fine common-time hornpipes for fiddle, including The High Level Bridge, The Beeswing, The Hawk and The Omnibus. He was sufficiently well known that many other tunes by others, such as Blaydon Flats, were also mistakenly attributed to him. He was of much more than local importance. The Newcastle style of hornpipe, of which he was the best-known exponent, became the model for many later-19th-century examples. Many of his tunes, particularly The High Level Bridge and The Beeswing became well-known wherever hornpipes were played both of these were published in Ryan's Mammoth Collection, which was first published in Boston in 1884. A book, The Lads like Beer was compiled by Graham Dixon and first published in the 1990s by Wallace Music. A new revised edition was published in 2013 (Mitchell Music ) with additional information and background to Hill's known compositions and those attributed to or known to be played by him.

The ASC is notable for its theatre, the Blackfriars Playhouse, the world's first recreation of the original indoor Blackfriars Theatre in London that was demolished in 1655. As a theater company, the ASC hosts performances by two rotating ensembles of 16 different titles in 5 distinct seasons, 52 weeks a year, at its Blackfriars Playhouse, as well as hosting a regional travelling company, ASC on Tour. The ASC also provides a year-round laboratory for students and scholars through education programming in Staunton and on the road.  History  = Shenandoah Shakespeare EXPRESS = The American Shakespeare Center was founded as the Shenandoah Shakespeare EXPRESS in 1988 by Dr. Ralph Alan Cohen and Jim Warren. The first show performed by the newly organized company was Richard III, where actors who made up the locally travelling ensemble troupe came from James Madison University's current students and graduates, and the performance was two hours long (compared to a more typical three hour plus run time). In 1990, the company started performing multiple shows in rotating repertory with a season of A Midsummer Night's Dream and Julius Caesar. Shenandoah Shakespeare Express grew quickly during its first five years, moving from a single touring show in Virginia in 1988 to a three-show tour in 1992 that included the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., and an overseas leg in London and Edinburgh. Three years later, the company toured the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, and Scotland as well as starting to build the Education arm of the company with a six-week National Endowment for the Humanities institute. In 1997, the Shenandoah Shakespeare Express introduced the Young Company Theatre Camp, a three-week intensive summer program for high school students. = Shenandoah Shakespeare = Shenandoah Shakespeare Express changed its name to Shenandoah Shakespeare in 1999 and moved to Staunton, Virginia. In September 2001, the Blackfriars Playhouse ‚Äì the world's first re-creation of Shakespeare's indoor theatre ‚Äì opened in Staunton, Virginia and ASC Education hosted its first Blackfriars Conference. In 2014, another replica of the Blackfriars theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was opened in London. = American Shakespeare Center = In 2005, Shenandoah Shakespeare changed its name to the American Shakespeare Center to reflect its focus on being a center for performance and research. Also in 2005, the first Actors' Renaissance Season debuted. The Actors' Renaissance Season uses Shakespeare's rehearsal conditions (self-directed, self-designed, short rehearsal period) as well as his staging conditions to delve deeper into the plays. The Actors' Renaissance Season is also an opportunity to explore rarer titles of the early modern period. In 2005, the Bob Carlton musical, Return to the Forbidden Planet, which was loosely based on Shakespeare's The Tempest and the science- fiction classic movie from the late 1950s, Forbidden Planet, was produced by the touring company, then called the Blackfriars Stage Company. The performances incorporated acoustic music, a piano, and a three-sided thrust stage, all of which were selected to maximize audience engagement. The American Shakespeare Center celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 2013. = Shakespeare's New Contemporaries = In April 2017, the American Shakespeare Center launched an international playwrighting competition to develop a canon of new plays that are inspired by and in conversation with the work of William Shakespeare. Each new play will be performed in rotating repertory with the Shakespeare play it corresponds with. Each round names the Shakespeare plays to serve as \\"jumping off points\\" for playwrights. Plays * Round 1: Anne Page Hates Fun by Amy E. Witting (Performed February 7-April 14, 2018) - In conversation with The Merry Wives of Windsor * Round 1: 16 Winters or the Bear's Tale by Mary Elizabeth Hamilton (Performed May 1-June 8, 2019) - In conversation with The Winter's Tale * Round 2: Keene by Anchuli Felicia King - In conversation with Othello * Round 2: The Defamation of Cicely Lee by Emma Whipday - In conversation with Cymbeline  Blackfriars Playhouse  The Blackfriars Playhouse In Staunton, the ASC constructed the Blackfriars Playhouse, the first modern re-creation of Shakespeare's original indoor theatre, the Blackfriars Theatre. As no reliable plans of that theatre are known, architect Tom McLaughlin based the design on plans for other 17th- century theatres, his own trips to England to view surviving halls of the period, Shakespeare's stage directions and other research and consultation. The chosen dimensions of by were derived from the research of theatre historian Irwin Smith. Construction began on the playhouse in early 2000, as part of a three-building construction plan that would also include a re- creation of the 1614 Globe Theatre and a Center for Research and Education. The theater was built with timber sourced by Dreaming Creek. The playhouse was completed at a cost of $3.7 million, and opened in September 2001. Built inside a brick shell, it is a wood-pegged, post-and-beam structure, made of Virginia oak, with a hammerbeam roof. The seating capacity is 300. Raked benches in a pit and two levels of galleries place the audience close to the actors, and even seating on the stage is possible. Unlike the original Blackfriars, the theatre has no painted decorations except at the back of the stage, and no windows in the auditorium. Electrical lighting reflected off the ceiling is used to simulate daylight, and lights simulating candles are mounted on sconces, and on wrought-iron chandeliers. In 2012, the Blackfriars Playhouse appeared in BBC's documentary Shakespeare Uncovered, which aired in the U.S. in early 2013.  Shakespeare's staging conditions  The American Shakespeare Center gives its audiences some of the same experiences that an Elizabethan playgoer would have enjoyed by following the basic principles of Renaissance theatrical production - including Universal Lighting (audience and actors share the same pool of light), Doubling (one actor playing multiple roles in a show), cross-gender casting (men playing female characters and vice versa), and minimal sets.  Productions  For resident theatre companies, according to Zelda Fichandler, \\"repertory is destiny\\" - a theatre company acquires its audience by the productions it presents. Most of the productions at the American Shakespeare Center's are from Shakespeare's canon; however, each year several productions are works by his contemporary playwrights or more modern plays that relate directly to the Shakespeare canon or work well using Shakespeare's staging conditions. Educational programming ASC Education offers workshops, performances, staged readings, lectures, a biennial international conference, teacher training, archival materials for scholarly research, and summer programs for teens and adults.  Mary Baldwin University  The ASC partners with Mary Baldwin University in the one-of-a- kind MLitt/MFA Shakespeare and Performance graduate program for actors, directors, teachers, and dramaturgs. The program's graduates have gone on to doctoral work, tenure-track faculty positions, and professional theatre careers.

It was written by the Internet Archive. It is available under a free software license and written in Java. The main interface is accessible using a web browser, and there is a command-line tool that can optionally be used to initiate crawls. Heritrix was developed jointly by the Internet Archive and the Nordic national libraries on specifications written in early 2003. The first official release was in January 2004, and it has been continually improved by employees of the Internet Archive and other interested parties. Heritrix was not the main crawler used to crawl content for the Internet Archive's web collection for many years. The largest contributor to the collection, as of 2011, is Alexa Internet. Alexa crawls the web for its own purposes, using a crawler named ia_archiver. Alexa then donates the material to the Internet Archive. The Internet Archive itself did some of its own crawling using Heritrix, but only on a smaller scale. Starting in 2008, the Internet Archive began performance improvements to do its own wide scale crawling, and now does collect most of its content.  Projects using Heritrix  A number of organizations and national libraries are using Heritrix, among them: * Austrian National Library, Web Archiving * Bibliotheca Alexandrina's Internet Archive * Biblioth√®que nationale de France * British Library * California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service * CiteSeerX * Documenting Internet2 * Internet Memory Foundation * Library and Archives Canada * Library of Congress * National and University Library of Iceland * National Library of Finland * National Library of New Zealand * National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek) * Netarkivet.dk * Smithsonian Institution Archives * National Library of Israel  Arc files  Older versions of Heritrix by default stored the web resources it crawls in an Arc file. This file format is wholly unrelated to ARC (file format). This format has been used by the Internet Archive since 1996 to store its web archives. More recently it saves by default in the WARC file format, which is similar to ARC but more precisely specified and more flexible. Heritrix can also be configured to store files in a directory format similar to the Wget crawler that uses the URL to name the directory and filename of each resource. An Arc file stores multiple archived resources in a single file in order to avoid managing a large number of small files.

Their tracks contain a mix of thirties jazz, with a touch of funky soul, Balkan beats and Merseyside pop. Absynthe Minded originally was a one-man band, being musician-singer-composer Bert Ostyn. He started off in 1999 with recording More Than This on 8-track in a 5 to 4 bedroom in Ghent, Belgium, with songs in a moderate rock genre. The opportunity to record some material in a studio brought forth Mushroom Holiday (2000). On that demo other musicians collaborated with Ostyn for the first time, which led later on to the forming of a band called Tao Tse Tse. Ostyn‚Äôs third demo, Krankenhaus Hotel, was recorded in a noisy apartment bedroom again, on a Tascam four track. The first band-demo was called Sweet Oblivion (2002); the band itself was renamed Absynthe Minded Quartet. Under this name they toured on their own and as support act for several bands and artists (most notably Spinvis and Zita Swoon). 2003 saw the release of their first official effort, the History makes Science Fiction EP, released on the Keremos label. The musicians were the same as before: Renaud Ghilbert, Sergej van Bouwel and Jan Duthoy but were joined by drummer Jakob Nachtergaele, playing the drums and woodblocks on one song. 'Quartet' was dropped from the band's name. Their debut full-length album, Acquired Taste, was released in 2004, on the Keremos label and EMI Belgium. It was produced by Geoffrey Burton. New Day was recorded in the end of January 2005 and was produced by producer Jean- Marie Aerts. After touring Belgium and the Netherlands, they recorded 16 songs and released the album in March in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. That summer, New Day was also to be released in Portugal. From this album came Absynthe Minded‚Äôs first single, \\"My Heroics, Part One\\", which gained much airplay. In 2007 Absynthe Minded recorded their third album, There Is Nothing. In August 2009, the album Absynthe Minded was released in Belgium and The Netherlands. The first two singles from the album were the tracks \\"Envoi\\" and \\"Moodswing Baby\\". In February 2010 at the Flemish Music Industry Awards they won prizes for Hit of the Year, best album, best rock/alternative and best band. After the release of Absynthe Minded the band was signed by the French Label AZ (Universal) for releases outside Belgium and The Netherlands. The album As It Ever Was was released in 2012. In 2020 the band released the album called Riddle of the Sphinx.

However, unlike the other texts of the Avesta, the Vendidad is an ecclesiastical code, not a liturgical manual. Name The name of the texts is a contraction of the Avestan language V√Æ-Da√™v√¥-DƒÅta, \\"Given Against the Daevas (Demons)\\", and as the name suggests, the Vendidad is an enumeration of various manifestations of evil spirits, and ways to confound them. According to the divisions of the Avesta as described in the Denkard, a 9th-century text, the Vendidad includes all of the 19th nask, which is then the only nask that has survived in its entirety. Contents The Vendidad's different parts vary widely in character and in age. Although some portions are relatively recent in origin, the subject matter of the greater part is very old. In 1877, Karl Friedrich Geldner identified the texts as being linguistically distinct from both the Old Avestan language texts as well as from the Yashts of the younger Avesta. Today, there is controversy over historical development of the Vendidad. The Vendidad is classified by some as an artificial, young Avestan text. Its language resembles Old Avestan. The Vendidad is thought to be a Magi (Magi- influenced) composition. p. 160ff. Portions of the book are available online. It has also been suggested that the Vendidad belongs to a particular school, but \\"no linguistic or textual argument allows us to attain any degree of certainty in these matters.\\" p. 35 The Vendidad consists of 22 fargards containing fragments of discussions between Ahura Mazda and Zoroaster. The arrangement does not suggest it was composed by the prophet's contemporaries. However, some consider the Vendidad a link to ancient early oral traditions, later written as a book of laws for the Zoroastrian community. The writing of the Vendidad began - perhaps substantially - before the formation of the Median and Persian Empires, before the 8th century B.C.E.. In addition, as with the Yashts, the date of composition of the final version does not exclude the possibility that some parts of the Vendidad may consist of very old material. Even in this modern age, Zoroastrians are continually rewriting old spiritual material. The first chapter is dualistic creation myth, followed by the description of a destructive winter comparable with the great floods of various other mythologies. The second chapter recounts the legend of Yima (Jamshid). Chapter 19 relates the temptation of Zoroaster, who, when urged by Angra Mainyu to turn from the good religion, turns instead towards Ahura Mazda. The remaining chapters cover diverse rules and regulations, through the adherence of which evil spirits may be confounded. Broken down by subject, these fargards deal with the following topics (chapters where a topic is covered are in brackets): * hygiene (in particular care of the dead) [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 19] and cleansing [9,10]; * disease, its origin, and spells against it [7, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22]; * mourning for the dead [12], the Towers of Silence [6], and the remuneration of deeds after death [19]; * the sanctity of, and invocations to, Atar (fire) [8], Zam (earth) [3,6], Apas (water) [6, 8, 21] and the light of the stars [21]; * the dignity of wealth and charity [4], of marriage [4, 15] and of physical effort [4] * statutes on unacceptable social behaviour [15] such as breach of contract [4] and assault [4]; * on the worthiness of priests [18]; * praise and care of the bull [21], the dog [13, 15], the otter [14], the Sraosha bird [18], and the Haoma tree [6]. There is a degree of moral relativism apparent in the Vendidad, and the diverse rules and regulations are not always expressed as being mystical, absolute, universal or mandatory. The Vendidad is mainly about social laws, mores, customs and culture. In some instances, the description of prescribed behaviour is accompanied by a description of the penances that have to be made to atone for violations thereof. Such penances include: * payment in cash or kind to the aggrieved; * corporal punishment such as whipping; * repeated recitations of certain parts of the liturgy such as the Ahuna Vairya invocation.  Value of the Vendidad among Zoroastrians  Most of the Zoroastrians continue to use the Vendidad as a valued and fundamental cultural and ethical moral guide, viewing their teachings as essential to Zoroastrian tradition and see it as part of Zoroastrianism original perspectives about the truth of spiritual existence. They argue that it has origins on early oral tradition, being only later written.http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/vndimp33.htmlhttp://www.frashogard.com/wp- content/uploads/2007/09/the-vendidad- part-3.pdfhttp://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/ranghaya/index.htm The emergent reformist Zoroastrian movement reject the later writings in the Avesta as being corruptions of Zarathustra's original teachings and thus do not consider the Vendidad as an original Zoroastrian scripture. They argue that it was written nearly 700 years after the death of Zarathustra and interpret the writing as different from the other parts of the Avesta.http://www.vohuman.org/Article/Is%20The%20Vandidad%20a%20%20Zarathushtrian%20Scripture.htm] http://accessnewage.com/articles/mystic/avest.htm An article by Hannah M. G. Shapero sums up the reformist perspective:http://www.pyracantha.com/Z/vendnet.html > \\"How do Zoroastrians view the Vendidad today? And how many of the laws of > the Vendidad are still followed? This depends, as so many other Zoroastrian > beliefs and practices do, on whether you are a \\"reformist\\" or a > \\"traditionalist.\\" The reformists, following the Gathas as their prime guide, > judge the Vendidad harshly as being a deviation from the non-prescriptive, > abstract teachings of the Gathas. For them, few if any of the laws or > practices in the Vendidad are either in the spirit or the letter of the > Gathas, and so they are not to be followed. The reformists prefer to regard > the Vendidad as a document which has no religious value but is only of > historic or anthropological interest. Many Zoroastrians, in Iran, India, and > the world diaspora, inspired by reformists, have chosen to dispense with the > Vendidad prescriptions entirely or only to follow those which they believe > are not against the original spirit of the Gathas.\\" Liturgical use Although the Vendidad is not a liturgical manual, a section of it may be recited as part of a greater Yasna service. Although such extended Yasnas appears to have been frequently performed in the mid-18th century (as noted in Anquetil-Duperron's observations), it is very rarely performed at the present day. In such an extended service, Visparad 12 and Vendidad 1-4 are inserted between Yasna 27 and 28. The Vendidad ceremony is always performed between nightfall and dawn, though a normal Yasna is performed between dawn and noon. Because of its length and complexity, the Vendidad is read, rather than recalled from memory as is otherwise necessary for the Yasna texts. The recitation of the Vendidad requires a priest of higher rank (one with a moti khub) than is normally necessary for the recitation of the Yasna. The Vendidad should not be confused with the Vendidad Sad√©. The latter is the name for a set of manuscripts of the Yasna texts into which the Vendidad and Visperad have been interleaved. These manuscripts were used for liturgical purposes outside the yasna ceremony proper, not accompanied by any ritual activity. The expression sad√©, \\"clean\\", was used to indicate that these texts were not accompanied by commentaries in Middle Persian.

It belongs to the Einheits-Elektrolokomotiven (standardised electric locomotives) program and was built for express passenger service. In 1968 the series was redesignated as class 110 (E10) and class 112 (E10.12). In 1988 the last series of class 112 locomotives were designated as class 114, and in 1991 the remaining locomotives of class 112 were designated as class 113. In 2006 38 locomotives were designated as class 115.  Development history  In 1950, the Deutsche Bundesbahn decided to develop two base types of electric locomotives with largely standardised components: A twelve-wheel (UIC: Co'Co') freight train locomotive as successor for the Class E 94, and an eight-wheel (UIC: Bo'Bo') general purpose electric locomotive as successor for the Class E 44. As a new feature the engineers should be able to be seated, whereas formerly they had to stand in order to boost their attentiveness. This multi-purpose locomotive received the working title E 46, but was then renamed to Class E 10, once the required maximum speed was increased from , which formally made this model an express train locomotive. The trial program, which consisted of 5 prototypes of class E 10.0, resulted in the realization that a single uniform type of electric locomotive was not sufficient to cover all needs. The modified program then included a local passenger train locomotive (class E 41); an express train locomotive (class E 10), which could be changed into a freight train locomotive (Class E 40) with a gear ratio change, and a heavy six-axle freight train locomotive (class E 50). In addition plans for a high speed electric locomotive Class E 01 were made, but quickly cancelled, as, due to low maximum speeds on the main lines at that time, the class E 10 was seen as sufficient for express trains.  Production of class E 10  The five prototypes of class E 10.0 were taken out of service between 1975 and 1978. Of these E 10 003 and E 10 005 were preserved as museum locomotives. The first serial units went into service in 1956 and started with number E 10 101 (class E 10.1). As opposed to class E 40 these units were equipped with a rheostatic/regenerative brake, which also accounted for the difference in the roof design between the two classes. Starting in December 1956 a total of 379 locomotives in several series were delivered by the manufacturers (Krupp, Henschel, Krauss-Maffei (mechanical parts); Siemens, AEG, BBC (electrical parts). Starting with E 10 288 the new body used with E 10.12 (see below), the so-called \\"crease\\" (B√ºgelfalte) type, was also applied to all regular E 10 machines. Thereafter these locomotives were sometimes designated as class E 10.3. One locomotive (designated 750 001) served as a service locomotive for the Central Office of the German Federal Railways in Minden (BZA Minden, or Bahnzentralamt) from 1989 to 1996. The earlier units up to E10 287 became E10.1, then 110.1 in 1968; they were nicknamed \\"Kasten\\", for box. The service spectrum of the (since 1968 as class 110 designated) locomotives was shifted more and more to local/regional service by the 1990s. As part of this shift, during the third stage of the Bahn reform program the locomotives were assigned to the local service branch DB Regio, which practically meant the end of their service in the express area. In order to use the machines more efficiently in regional service, from 1997 many of the units were equipped with push-pull train controls, partly using components of class 140 and class 141 units that were retired. Originally the class E 10 units were delivered in cobalt blue express train livery, the blue indicating that they were cleared for a maximum speed of or more. Starting in 1974, as part of other maintenance, the new ocean blue/beige colour scheme was applied to the locomotives. From 1987 the (then- current) orient-red was used, which was then substituted, starting in 1997, with the traffic red (verkehrsrot) concept, which is the current colour of all active locomotives of this class, barring a few exceptions.  Construction  As all other types of the Einheitslokomotiven program, the class E 10 / class 110 had 2-axle pivoted bogies/trucks as welded box construction with pivot pins, and welded superstructure with fan grills. The class 110.3 used the body of the E 10.12 with the pulled-forward frontal area, also called the ‚Äúcrease‚Äù (B√ºgelfalte). The frame is propped up over the bogies by coil springs and rubber elements. Originally a bumpy ride at higher speeds was noticeable, which required repeated rework of the bogies. In two locomotives (110 475 and 476) a flexicoil suspension was tested. All locomotives feature an indirect air brake manufactured by Knorr, with automatically stronger braking action at high speeds; for shunting/switching service an additional direct brake is present. All units also feature a separately excited rheostatic/regenerative brake, which is coupled to the air brake. The heat generated by the electric brakes is dissipated via roof exhausts. For the first time in German locomotives high voltage regulation of the transformer was used in serial production. The traction motors are 14-pole motors of type WB 372, which were later again used in class 111 and 151. As was the case in all locomotives in the Einheitslokomotiven program, the rubber ring transmission system made by the Siemens-Schuckert-Werke/SSW was utilized, which had proven themselves above all expectations in the prototype E 10.0 units. On the roof are found scissor (double-arm) pantographs of the type DBS 54a, standardized for all Einheits classes, mounted on the obligatory roof insulators, as well as the compressed air main switch and the current-to-voltage converter for the monitoring of the overhead wire voltage. The 3-core transformers are oil- cooled, to which the control unit with its 28 running steps is connected. The acceleration is designed to function in delayed mode, where the engineer chooses the running step, and the control unit will initiate the chosen setting independently. For emergency operation manual control by hand crank is possible. Many locomotives feature thyristor load diverters. The safety equipment in the driver's cab features either a mechanical or electronic deadman's device, punctiform automatic train controls (now compliant with the new regulations with software version PZB 90), and train radio equipment with GSM-R communication. Relatively recently computers were added for the electronic timetable EBuLa, as well as the automatic door locking at 0 km/h (TB0), which has become a compulsory requirement for all locomotives in passenger service. A few units have also been equipped with computers for the control system CIR-ELKE.  Variants  = Class E 10.12 / class 112 (1962-1991)= DB Class 112 engines in Hamburg 1984 During production some E 10 units were equipped with newly developed Henschel-made bogies and transmissions fit for speeds up to 160 km/h, and starting in 1962-63 they pulled long-distance express trains such as the Rheingold, and were classified as class E 10.12 (and from 1968 designated as class 112). In addition these locomotives introduced the more aerodynamic superstructure (the \\"crease\\", or B√ºgelfalte), which was used for all new units of the class E 10, starting with E 10 288. In order to differentiate these units from the \\"normal\\" E 10s, a \\"1\\" (indicating a sub-class) was placed in front of the running number. In this way the E 10 1265-1270 were established, which became the eponym for the class description of E 10.12. In 1963-64 came E 10 1308-1312, again with Henschel- made high-speed bogies, primarily for the Rheinpfeil. Neither group of E10.12 locomotives was ready in time for the launch of the trains for which they were ordered. Pending their delivery, 2 separate groups of E10.1 locomotives (E10 239-244 in 1962-63, and E10 250-254 in 1963-64) were temporarily modified for 160 km/h service, complete with Henschel bogies, the prefix 1 to their running numbers, and the appropriate paint scheme. All were later restored to normal E10.1 standards. Finally, in 1968, came 112 485, already designated as class 112, which did not have the expensive Henschel bogies, but featured modified serial-production bogies. = Class 113 (1991-today)= DB Class 113 locomotive By 1991 it had become clear that the deployment of the 11 locomotives of the first two series of class 112 in heavy and fast service had taken its toll. Several gear wheel malfunctions during service caused heavy damage to motor and transmission of the affected units. The maximum speed was reduced to as an emergency measure, and the locomotives were only utilized as express trains in the Munich area. At the time they were already re-designated as class 113, in order to free up the designation of class 112 in the new German number scheme (for the more numerous and modern class 212 locomotives of the former East German Deutsche Reichsbahn of the GDR). In the meantime these locomotives, after some units had been fitted with refurbished Henschel high-speed bogies in the mid-1990s, were able to again work at the speed of 160 km/h, but were considered not to be much better than the normal class 110 units, and were soon listed for impending retirement. = Class 114 (1988-1995)= Class 114 is made up of 20 re-designated units from the third series of class 112, which were capable of speeds up to 160 km/h, and ran on modified bogies made for class 110 in serial production. Because of significant wear, starting in 1985 the top speed of locomotives with numbers 112 485-504 was reduced to . To differentiate these units from the other class 112 machines, which were still allowed to travel at , they were designated as class 114 from 1988 on. Further conspicuous issues on and around the bogies continued to be noticed even after the speed reduction, and the locomotives were first further slowed down to , and retired altogether soon thereafter. Starting in 1993, using bogies from class 110 units with numbers 110 287 and lower, all 20 of the class 114 locomotives were rebuilt as normal class 110.3 units and were inserted into inventory as 110 485-504. 18 of the class 110, which lost their bogies to these \\"new\\" 110s, were rebuilt with bogies from retired class 140 locomotives, and were re-designated as members of class 139, with which class they were nearly identical in the first place, due to their electric brake system. (The 2 remaining former class 114s received bogies from 2 other retired class 110.3 units). The concept of the Einheitslokomotive completely paid for itself in this swap exercise. = Class 115 - since 2005= DB Class 115 in Frankfurt Starting in 2005 a few former class 110 and class 113 units were transferred from DB Regio to DB Autozug, the DB subsidiary for express passenger service with car transportation. In order to differentiate these units, they are slowly being renumbered to class 115, and are being relocated to Berlin-Rummelsburg. These locomotives are thereby the first units of this class to be domiciled in the former East Germany. The Class 115 hosts one of the oldest locomotives still in regular passenger service in Germany. 115 114-1 (pictured in 2006 on the left) was introduced on 21 November 1957, and is used on various InterCity services across Germany.

History Ruins of Alt-Signau Castle The village church of Signau Signau is first mentioned between 1130 and 1146 as Sigenowo. Scattered mesolithic, Bronze Age and medieval artifacts indicate a long history of settlements in the area. By the High Middle Ages the Lords of Schweinsberg-Attinghausen had built their ancestral castle above the village. The remains of possibly four other earthen fortifications have been discovered around the area. Though the Schweinsberg-Attinghausen castle fell into ruins in 13th or 14th century, the village with Alt- and Neu-Signau Castles (today in Bowil municipality) formed the center of the Herrschaft of Signau. The Barons of Signau built St. Mary's Church in Signau as the parish church for the parish. In 1529 the city of Bern acquired the village and Herrschaft of Signau. In 1648, the village of Eggiwil left the Signau parish to form its own parish and eventually it politically split to become an independent municipality. The village church was renovated and rebuilt in 1850. By 1622 Signau had a yearly market in the fall. Two other yearly markets were added in the 18th century. By 1800 the town was home to a number of industries and businesses in addition to the farmers and livestock herders who lived there. In 1856 the Sch√ºpbach canal drained the swampy valley floor and opened up additional farm land. In 1864 the Bern-Langnau railroad connected Signau to the growing Swiss rail network. The first line was followed in 1875 by the Langnau-Lucerne line. The good rail and road connections encouraged industry to settle in the town. By 2005, agriculture provided about one-third of all jobs in the community. There are several primary schools scattered around the municipality in H√∂he, H√§leschwand, Mutten and Sch√ºpbach. The secondary school in Signau pulls in students from R√∂thenbach, Eggiwil and Bowil as well as Signau. Geography Emme river at Sch√ºpbach Aerial view (1946) Signau has an area of .

Over the course of his ministry, he toured with R. A. Torrey and John Wilbur Chapman, most notably. In 1904, Alexander married Helen Cadbury, daughter of the Cadbury Chocolate Company president. She toured with him on the evangelistic circuit as a women's worker. Together they spread The Pocket Testament League around the world. Alexander's early Christian influence came from his mother, who was in the habit of reading Dwight L. Moody sermons to the family every night around the fireplace. At an 1880 revival, a thirteen-year-old Charlie Alexander committed to the Christian faith. He attended Moody Bible Institute from 1892 to 1894, after which time he toured with the M. B. Williams revival campaign. In 1902, he joined Dr. R. A. Torrey's Australian tour. In 1907, Alexander joined forces with evangelist John Wilbur Chapman to launch the \\"Chapman-Alexander Simultaneous Campaign.\\" The duo assembled an impressive team of evangelists and songleaders and took to the streets. The first joint campaign was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from March 12 to April 19, 1908. They partitioned the city into 42 sections covered by 21 evangelist-musicians teams. They spent three weeks on each half of the city, resulting in approximately 8000 conversions. It was at a similar Chapman-Alexander event eight years later in North Carolina that the legendary King James Only proponent D O Fuller committed to the Christian faith. Chapman's biography reports, \\"The first Chapman-Alexander worldwide campaign left Vancouver, British Columbia, on March 26, 1909, and returned November 26. Stops along the way included: Melbourne, Sydney, Ipswich, Brisbane, Adelaide, Ballarat, Bendigo, and Townsville in Australia; Manila in the Philippines; Hong Kong, Kowloon, Canton, Shanghai, Hankow, Peking and Tientsin in China; Seoul, Korea; Kobe, Kyoto, Tokyo, and Yokohama in Japan.\\"Billy Graham Collection , Papers of John Wilbur Chapman By the end of 1910, Chapman's \\"mass evangelism\\" technique was losing favor in evangelistic circles, and Chapman and Alexander were back to large meeting revivals by 1912. The final Chapman-Alexander revival tour was conducted January 6 to February 13, 1918. After the conclusion of that crusade, Alexander retired to England, where he lived out the remaining two years of his life. He died in 1920 in Birmingham, England and was interred in Lodge Hill Cemetery. Alexander was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1991.

The heraldic emblem of Moscow has been an integral part of the coat of arms of Russia since the 16th century.

Seal 2a (Drawing of both sides of Yaroslav's seal. Left is Yaroslav himself; right is Saint George.) Saint George was his personal patron saint; he was baptised George. Saint George was also the patron saint of Yaroslav's great-grandson, Yury Dolgoruky, who - according to tradition - founded the city of Moscow shortly before his death in 1157. (The name \\"Yury\\" is a Russian-language equivalent of \\"George\\".) Yury Dolgoruky is thought to have honored his patron saint on his coins, which represent a standing warrior holding a sword in his right hand. Yury's elder brother, Mstislav the Great (Grand Prince of Kiev from 1125 to 1132), also used a seal featuring a horseman slaying a basilisk. A century later, Alexander Nevsky (lived 1221-1263) resumed this usage. Several of his coins depict a horseman slaying a basilisk or a dragon, though the beast is not always visible. Alexander's motivation for reverting to Mstislav's emblem is disputed. It is possible that the image referred to his own victories over the Swedish and German crusaders in the Battle of the Neva (1240) and the Battle of the Ice (1242). Saint Theodore as dragon slayer. It says: –§—î–¥—ä—Ä (an Old-Russian version of –§—ë–¥–æ—Ä, Theodore) Muscovite Russia Alexander's great-grandson, Ivan II, was the first ruler of Moscow to employ as his emblem the standing warrior with a sword in his hand. Ivan's son Dmitry Donskoy chose to represent this warrior riding a horse with a spear in his hand. Historians traditionally connect Dmitry's symbol with his victory over the Mongols in the Battle of Kulikovo, although historical clues are scarce. At about the same time, a similar symbol, the Vytis, emerged as a state emblem in the rival Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

The symbol of the horseman passed down through the generations: from Dmitry to his son Vasily I, then to Vasily II and Ivan III. A coin which featured the image became known as kopeck, from kopyo, the Russian word for \\"spear\\". Ivan III used the triumphant horseman as a state emblem of Russia on his seal from 1479. In 1497, it was replaced with the double-headed eagle, popularly interpreted as a symbol of Ivan's marriage into the last ruling dynasty of the East Roman Empire, thus illustrating his claim to the Byzantine political and cultural heritage. Both emblems had been used on state seals alternatively until 1562, when the first Russian tsar, Ivan IV the Terrible, combined them by placing a heraldic shield with the triumphant horseman to the chest of the double-headed eagle. This layout has become known as the coat of arms of the Russian Empire and then of the Russian Federation. Imperial Russia The coat of arms of Moscow city. 1781 The coat of arms of Moscow Governorate. At first the charging horseman was interpreted as showing the figure of the ruling tsar slaying an enemy intruding into the Russian lands. This attitude was clearly expressed by the Muscovite statesman Grigory Kotoshikhin, among others. On the title page of the 1663 Bible, the heraldic horseman appears to have the face of Tsar Alexis. Relief above the entrance to the Tretyakov Gallery. The foreigners visiting Muscovy were the first to notice the emblem's resemblance to the traditional iconography of Saint George and the Dragon. Although during Peter I's reign the horseman was still represented with a crown and his face bore some resemblance to Peter's, this Westernizing monarch was the first to identify the heraldic horseman as St. George. A learned Italian heraldist in Peter's service, Count Santi, associated the horseman with St. George as the patron saint of the prince who founded Moscow. In 1730, Santi prepared the first detailed description of the heraldic emblem of Moscow, which, drawing on the traditions of Western heraldry, named the horseman as St. George. In Santi's version of the emblem, set against the red field appears a white knight riding a silver horse and charging with his spear against a black dragon reminiscent of Zilant, a heraldic symbol of Muslim Kazan. With several minor modifications, this emblem was officially confirmed December 20, 1781, during Catherine II's municipal reform which involved standardization of the municipal heraldry. In 1883, it was decided to bring the colours of Moscow's emblem in line with the three colours of the flag of Russia. The colour of the dragon was changed from black to white and the horseman's cloak was altered from gold to azure. These colours do not appear to correspond to the colour scheme traditionally used in Russian icons depicting Saint George and the Dragon. In 1903, the ancient colour scheme was revived by painter Viktor Vasnetsov in his design of the Tretyakov Gallery fa√ßade, whose entrance also displays a large effigy of St. George and the Dragon. 20th century The emblem that was in use between 1924 and 1993. It is an example of socialist heraldry. After the Russian Revolution, the heraldic symbols of the Russian Empire were banned. On September 22, 1924, the Moscow Soviet adopted a new emblem of Moscow which features a red star, the sickle and hammer symbol, and the monument of the Soviet Constitution (the statue of liberty).The monument to the first Soviet Constitution (the Russian Constitution of 1918) stood from 1919 until 1941 on Soviet Square (present-day Tverskaya Square) in Moscow in front of the Moscow Soviet (Mossoviet) building (now the mayor's office). It was broken down in 1941 and replaced in 1954 with a statue of Yuriy DolgorukiyLink to the Russian Wikipedia page about the Soviet Constitution monument On the red scroll it says: –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏—Ö –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∞—Ä–º–µ–π—Å–∫–∏—Ö –¥–µ–ø—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–≤ (Moscow council of the deputies of the workers, the peasants, and the Red Army). The new emblem failed to gain popularity and was rarely used. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the heraldic representation of Moscow reverted in 1993 to the version used between 1883 and 1918, with some minor modifications. As the Russian Orthodox Church does not allow sculptural representations of saints, no statues of Saint George and the Dragon were erected in Moscow prior to the Revolution. After the emblem was restored on November 23, 1993, a cluster of statues on the subject were unveiled in Poklonnaya Gora, Tsvetnoi Boulevard, Manege Square, and other places in Moscow. Most of these were sculpted by Zurab Tsereteli, who also had other versions of the subject installed in such cities as New York City.

Applications Intelligent vehicle technologies commonly apply to car safety systems and self-contained autonomous electromechanical sensors generating warnings that can be transmitted within a specified targeted area of interest, say within 100 meters of the transceiver. In ground applications, intelligent vehicle technologies are utilized for safety and commercial communications between vehicles or between a vehicle and a sensor along the road. Intelligent vehicle technologies provide instantaneous on the road information to the motorist who wishes to map a route to a specific destination and expects the system to assist in determining the best course of travel. The information provided by the in-vehicle system updates approximately every minute (depending on the speed of the vehicle) all the transmitter beacon information self-recorded by the vehicle while traveling on the road. That is, all vehicles traveling on the highway update such information to the local mile markers via DSRC telematics. The mile markers in turn communicate with the regional monitoring station and upload data so as to populate statistical bar graph trend of traffic flow progression. The information further made available for access to the date collected by the system established data exchange format through standard Internet protocol IP address communications links. Usage-based insurance is based on telematics technology. Total system intelligence Total system intelligence means accountability of every IVT equipped vehicle traveling on the road. Vehicles can use gathered information from the road to determine lane specific vehicle usage and scenarios such as lane closures (in-vehicle notification warning), construction zones, emergency situations, etc. Information transmission and reception Intelligent vehicle technologies target transmission capable beacons provide for information signal data that are employed infrastructure to vehicle and vehicle to vehicle for exclusive precision remote communications to the specific one vehicle traveling in a given lane on the highway, for example ‚Äì or a convoy of vehicles in a given travel lane, or multiple vehicles traveling in all affected lanes. All lanes are beacon tagged so as the vehicle travels down the road the ground beacon maintains communication with the vehicle for that particular lane ‚Äì so it is therefore possible for example, for law enforcement to direct and provide for specific in-vehicle aural and/or visual information to a target vehicle traveling in a given lane (or multiple vehicle in multiple lanes as desired). Vehicles traveling in the vicinity of an accident scenario, for example, are simultaneously queried by the in-vehicle police intelligent beacon system computer which repeatedly updates and processes all dynamic passing vehicle data received, identifying and classifying all passing vehicles in real-time ‚Äì for example, an aural visual command instruction is sent to all the in-vehicle emergency warning beacon system computers as a reminder that no rubbernecking, for example, or viewing of the accident is permitted and vehicles are instructed to safely maintain a given speed limit. Ease of managing, operating, and reducing traffic congestion of the transportation system is therefore achieved. Examples For example: An official, noting through IVT that a car's registration has expired, could use telematics to direct the car's driver to pull the car over. A combination of in-vehicle beacon transceivers and RFID transmitters (surface installed such as reflector tags, or embedded onto the road) would detect a vehicle's position, serial number, make, model, color, unit identification, and orientation. Real-time data would be constantly updated, self-recorded, then uploaded by the vehicle to the telematics mile marker by the vehicle‚Äôs transceiver to enable intra-vehicle control communications.

Four species are known, three of which live in fresh waters. They were first discovered by Charles Chilton in 1898 and the genus Chiltonia was erected the following year by T. R. R. Stebbing in Chilton's honour. Chiltonia mihiwaka C. mihiwaka was the first of the species of Chiltonia to be described, when Charles Chilton named it in 1898 as a species in the genus Hyalella. Subsequent taxonomic splits have restricted the name to the populations in the Southland and Otago regions in New Zealand's South Island. Chilton's original material was collected on Mihiwaka, a hill near Port Chalmers, Otago. Adults are approximately long, wide and deep. Chiltonia enderbyensis C. enderbyensis was named by Hurley in 1954 for the populations of Chiltonia living on New Zealand's subantarctic islands, namely Enderby Island (one of the Auckland Islands) and Campbell Island. Males are approximately long, wide and deep, while females are long, wide and deep. Chiltonia rivertonensis C. rivertonensis was also named by Hurley in 1954, for a population living in small streams near Riverton, Southland. In November 2018 the Department of Conservation classified C. rivertonensis as \\"Nationally Critical\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. The species was judged as meeting the criteria for Nationally Critical threat status as a result of it occupying only in one location, the total area of which is less than 1 hectare. It is considered as being \\"Data Poor\\" and \\"Range Restricted\\" under that system. Chiltonia minuta C. minuta was the last of the four species to be described, and its affinities remain unclear. Whereas all the other species occur in fresh water, C. minuta was collected under kelp on a beach on Campbell Island. Australia Two species from Australia, C. subtenuis and C. australis were described by Sayce in 1901 and 1902, respectively. Both are now considered to belong to the related genus Austrochiltonia.

Built in 1980, Corkscrew was planned to reflect the design of its sister roller coaster Corkscrew at Cedar Point. It is notably one of the first roller coasters to feature a double corkscrew, as well as a vertical loop. The main differences that the Valleyfair model has is the addition of a finale helix and the omission of the camelback before the loop. Until the hypercoaster Wild Thing (the fifth highest and fastest roller coaster in the world at the time it opened in 1996), Corkscrew was the only outdoor all-steel roller coaster in Minnesota. Corkscrew is currently the only roller coaster at Valleyfair with inversions. The coaster's track was painted blue when it open in 1980 but was repainted orange and yellow in 2011.  Ride layout  After exiting the station and turning 180 degrees right, the train engages the lift hill and climbs to 85 feet in the air. After this, the ride drops directly into a vertical loop. This is followed by a short hill. After the hill, there is a rise and a banked right turn, leading into a double-corkscrew element. Exiting the second corkscrew, the ride goes over a small hill banked to the right, followed by an upward helix. The ride then makes a short left turn to align with the station and goes into the brakes. = Sister coaster = The older Corkscrew at Cedar Point is the same height and has the same inversions in the same order, but has a somewhat different layout. Cedar Point's model drops off the lift into a hill, followed by the loop. Rather than going into a short hill leading into an elevated banked turn like Valleyfair's Corkscrew, the Cedar Point Corkscrew goes up a rather high hill with a flat top, before swooping over the midway into the double corkscrews. (The Valleyfair model has a smaller hill, which comes after the loop rather than before and does not have the flat-topped hill.) Cedar Point's model omits the helix.

In the United States, state courts in California, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have ruled that ladies' night discounts are unlawful gender-based price discrimination under state or local statutes. However, courts in Illinois, Minnesota, and Washington have rejected a variety of challenges to such discounts.  Legality in the United States  = Federal law = Claims against ladies' nights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution have failed under the state action doctrine.Hollander v. Swindells-Donovan, 2010 WL 844588 (E.D.N.Y. 2010). Similar actions have failed under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983).Hollander v. Copacabana Nightclub, 580 F.Supp.2d 335 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).Comiskey v. JFTJ Corp., 989 F.2d 1007 (8th Cir. 1983). Ladies' nights may have federal tax implications, though.U.S. v. Covey Gas & Oil, 171 F.2d 213 (10th Cir. 1949). Federal claims were also involved in the unsuccessful challenge in Washington (see below). = California = The California Supreme Court has ruled that ladies' days at a car wash and ladies' nights at a nightclub violate California's Unruh Civil Rights Act in Koire v Metro Car Wash (1985)Koire v Metro Car Wash, 707 P.2d 195 (CA 1985). and Angelucci v. Century Supper Club (2007).Angelucci v. Century Supper Club, 158 P.3d 718 (CA 2007). The Unruh Act provides: \\"All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex [...] are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever [...].\\" The court considered the statutory defense that the promotions serve \\"substantial business and social purposes\\", but concluded that merely being profitable is not a sufficient defense. The court accused the Wisconsin Supreme Court of \\"sexual stereotyping\\" for upholding a similar practice. Koire held that: \\"Public policy in California strongly supports eradication of discrimination based on sex. The Unruh Act expressly prohibits sex discrimination by business enterprises.\\" Koire concluded: :\\"The legality of sex-based price discounts cannot depend on the subjective value judgments about which types of sex-based distinctions are important or harmful. The express language of the Unruh Act provides a clear and objective standard by which to determine the legality of the practices at issue. The Legislature has clearly stated that business establishments must provide \\"equal . . . advantages . . . [and] privileges\\" to all customers \\"no matter what their sex.\\" (¬ß 51.) Strong public policy supports application of the Act in this case. The defendants have advanced no convincing argument that this court should carve out a judicial exception for their sex-based price discounts. The straightforward proscription of the Act should be respected.\\" Subsequent to the decision, California passed the Gender Tax Repeal Act of 1995, which specifically prohibits differential pricing based solely on a customer's gender.Eric D. Hone and Franchesca Van Buren, \\"Is the Death Knell Ringing for Ladies' Nights?\\" Nevada Lawyer (March 2009). In Angelucci, the California Supreme Court ruled that discrimination victims did not have to ask the offending business to be treated equally in order to have standing to file an Unruh Act or Gender Tax Repeal Act claim. Courts have not found violations on the Unruh Act with discounts for which any customer could theoretically qualify for.Starkman v. Mann Theatres Corp., 227 Cal.App.3d 1491 (1991). The California Supreme Court opined: :\\"A multitude of promotional discounts come to mind which are clearly permissible under the Unruh Act. For example, a business establishment might offer reduced rates to all customers on one day each week. Or, a business might offer a discount to any customer who meets a condition which any patron could satisfy (e.g., presenting a coupon, or sporting a certain color shirt or a particular bumper sticker). In addition, nothing prevents a business from offering discounts for purchasing commodities in quantity, or for making advance reservations. The key is that the discounts must be ‚Äúapplicable alike to persons of every sex, color, race, [etc.]‚Äù ( ¬ß 51), instead of being contingent on some arbitrary, class-based generalization.\\" The Koire precedent has not been extended to strike down Mother's Day promotions.Cohn v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc., 169 Cal.App.4th 523 (2008). Koire was one of the precedents cited in the lower court (but not the state Supreme Court) in In re Marriage Cases = Illinois = Ladies' nights in Illinois have been upheld under the anti-discrimination provision of the Dram Shop Act.Dock Club, Inc. v. Illinois Liquor Control Commission, 404 N.E.2d 1050 (Ill. App. 1980). The court determined that the discount was intended to encourage women to attend the bar in greater numbers, rather than to discourage attendance by males.John E. Theuman, \\"Exclusion of one sex from admission to or enjoyment of equal privileges in places of accommodation or entertainment as actionable sex discrimination under state law\\" 38 A.L.R.4th 339 (1985). = Maryland = Montgomery County's human relations law has been interpreted to not only prohibit ladies' nights, but also a \\"Skirt and Gown Night\\" where a customer is given a 50% discount for wearing a skirt or gown.Peppin v. Woodside Delicatessen, 506 A.2d 263 (MD App. 1986). The court noted that: \\"Against this superficially humorous backdrop, we must decide whether this seemingly innocuous business practice constitutes unlawful discrimination within the meaning of a county ordinance.\\" The Montgomery County Code, Human Relations Law, ¬ß 27-9, prohibited: :\\"[...] any distinction with respect to any person based on race, color, sex, marital status, religious creed, ancestry, national origin, handicap, or sexual orientation in connection with admission to, service or sales in, or price, quality or use of any facility or service of any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement in the county.\\" The Maryland's appellate court's review was far from de novo and the court emphasized that: :\\"Although we believe the judge's findings to be contradicted by American cultural realities, we need not focus on the circuit court's determination; our review is that of the agency's conclusion based upon facts presented at the hearing. The record is replete with evidence that Skirt and Gown Night was intended to-and did-have the same effect and serve the same function as Ladies' Night, i.e. it provided price discounts to women and, in fact, operated as a mere extension of Ladies' Night.\\" The court also stressed the peculiarity and strictness of the municipal ordinance it was interpreting: :\\"We believe the ordinance is unambiguous. Thus, while allowed to do so under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, we are not allowed under the Montgomery County Ordinance or the Maryland Constitution to engage in a balancing test.\\" = Minnesota = Attempts by municipal governments to prevent ladies' nights have been struck down as ultra vires.In re On-Sale Liquor License, Class B., 763 N.W.2d 359 (Minn. App. 2009). In June 2010 the Minnesota Department of Human Rights said bars are discriminating against males by holding \\"ladies' night\\" promotions, but said it will not seek out bars that have a \\"ladies night.\\" = Nevada = In 2008, the Nevada Equal Rights Commission ruled in favor of a man who claimed a local gym offering free memberships to women was discriminatory. The ruling is thought to have had wide ramifications for ladies' night promotions across the state. Although the question has not been litigated in Nevada courts, two Nevada attorneys advise: \\"for the time being, businesses should exercise caution in utilizing gender-based pricing scheme promotions. While the ability of a plaintiff to succeed on such a claim in district court remains unknown, NERC has the ability to pursue such claims on the administrative level. Therefore, businesses should engage in a cost-benefit analysis, keeping in mind that they might have to spend time and resources defending a sex discrimination charge in front of NERC or elsewhere.\\" = New Jersey = In 2004, the director of New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety Division of Civil rights ruled that ladies' night promotions constituted unlawful discrimination in violation of the state's Law Against Discrimination. = New York = The New York State Human Rights Appeal Board disapproved of a New York Yankees \\"Ladies Day\\" promotion, which originated in 1876 as being \\"in a modern technological society where women and men are to be on equal footing as a matter of public policy.\\"Abosh v. New York Yankees, Inc. (1972) No. CPS-25284, Appeal No. 1194. = Pennsylvania = Such promotions violate the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act as unlawful gender discrimination where male patrons are charged an entrance fee or a greater charge for drinks and female patrons are not charged an identical entrance fee or the same charge for drinks as male patrons. In Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Dobrinoff, the Commonwealth Court specifically found that where a female patron was exempt from a cover charge, a go-go bar engaged in unlawful gender discrimination.80 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 453 (1984) The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board has stated as recently as 2009 that it will issue citations against establishments which charge patrons differing amounts based on gender.See Liquor Control Board Advisory Opinion of July 9, 2009 = Washington = Ladies' nights have been found not to violate state anti-discrimination law, or the federal constitution, by the Washington Supreme Court, even if held at a stadium owned by a city.MacLean v. First Northwest Industries of America, Inc., 635 P.2d 683 (WA 1981). The Washington Supreme Court concluded that \\"the respondent has shown no discrimination against men as a class and no damage to himself. As a consequence he has no right of action under the state Law Against Discrimination. \\" In part, the court emphasized in its ruling evidence presented in the trial court that \\"women do not manifest the same interest in basketball that men do,\\" and that the discount was only one of many discounts and promotions, the others available regardless of gender. Finally, the majority noted that \\"to decide important constitutional questions upon a complaint as sterile as this would be apt to erode public respect for the Equal Rights Amendment and deter rather than promote the serious goals for which it was adopted.\\" The dissenting justices emphasized their broader interpretation of the applicable prohibition and the potential for such promotions to reinforce stereotypes. One dissenting justice proposed that the complainant be allowed no damages, but only that the practice be enjoined. The dissent concluded: :\\"It may be that application of the Equal Rights Amendment to the ‚Äúpromotional‚Äù activity of defendant is not the sort of thing the voters had in mind when they adopted HJR 61. Then again, an equally persuasive argument could be made that ticket price differentials based on sex were indeed one of a number of activities which they hoped to end. It is idle to speculate. No evidence of any kind exists. I see no escape from finding in this case that the plain language of Const. art. 31 proscribes the activity in which the defendants have engaged. Any further clarification of popular intent must come through the process of constitutional amendment, not by the imaginings of this court. Const. art. 23.\\" = Wisconsin = The Wisconsin Supreme Court has held that such promotions violate the state's public accommodation law.Novak v. Madison Motel Associates, 525 N.W.2d 123 (Wis. App. 1994). The court noted that the text and legislative history of the statute permitted no distinction between sex, race, and other forms of discrimination.  Legality in the United Kingdom  Although ladies' nights are prohibited by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in the United Kingdom as unlawful discrimination, some clubs reportedly flout the ban.  Legality in Hong Kong  Ladies' nights were deemed unlawful by the Hong Kong District Court.http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law- crime/article/1936265/hong-kong-bar-operators-angry-ladies-night- discrimination  See also  * List of public house topics * Gender-based price discrimination in the United States  References  Category:Drinking culture Category:Sales promotion Category:Sexism Category:Discrimination ","title":"Ladies' night"},{"id":"5681702","text":"Frank Tannenbaum (4 March 1893 ‚Äì 1 June 1969) was an Austrian-American historian, sociologist and criminologist, who made significant contributions to modern Mexican history during his career at Columbia University. Early life Tannenbaum was born in Austria on 4 March 1893. His Eastern European Jewish family immigrated to the United States in 1905. He ran away from home as an adolescent and never finished high school. He worked at a number of menial jobs and became involved in radical labor politics of the era.Helen Delpar, Looking South: The Evolution of Latin Americanist Scholarship in the United States, 1850-1975. Tuscoloosa: University of Alabama Press 2008, p. 86. As a young man, he worked a busboy. During the economic crisis of 1913‚Äì1915, he became a leader of the Industrial Workers of the World. In January 1914, Tannenbaum, then 21 years old and a member of the IWW-affiliated Waiter's Industrial Union, proposed a campaign of demanding relief from New York City churches. Starting in February, he led masses of workers to churches, disrupted services, and demanded that they be given food and shelter. Although most churches complied, the New York press, notably The New York Times, decried Tannenbaum and the Wobblies. On March 4, Tannenbaum led a group of unemployed workers from Rutgers Square to the Catholic St. Alphonsus Church on West Broadway. There, they were met by a phalanx of police and the parish rector, who refused their demands. Tannenbaum and 190 other protesters were arrested; Tannenbaum was charged with inciting to riot and given an extraordinary $5,000 bail. At trial one protester received 60 days in jail, four 30 days, three 15 days, and the rest were let go; Tannenbaum was sent to jail for a year and fined $500. He spent the year on Blackwell's Island.Philip S. Foner, The Industrial Workers of the World, 1905‚Äì1917, vol. IV of History of the Labor Movement in the United States (New York: International Publishers, 1965), 442‚Äì448. When he got out of jail, Tannenbaum remained active in the IWW, and he was arrested alongside Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and Alexander Berkman during the Bayonne refinery strikes of 1915‚Äì1916, in Bayonne, New Jersey.Annual report, Volume 38, By New Jersey. Bureau of Industrial Statistics, New Jersey. Bureau of Statistics of Labor and Industries, page 225Foner, Industrial Workers of the World, 448. Emma Goldman described his arrest and imprisonment in her memoirs, Living My Life (1931): > We all had loved Frank for his wide-awakeness and his unassuming ways. He > had spent much of his free time in our office, reading and helping in the > work connected with Mother Earth. His fine qualities held out the hope that > Frank would some day play an important part in the labour struggle. None of > us had expected however that our studious, quiet friend would so quickly > respond to the call of the hour. After Bayonne, Tannenbaum soon abandoned his youthful radicalism. Academic career With the help of several philanthropists, he attended Columbia University, where classmates included Samuel Roth. In 1921, Tannenbaum received his bachelor's degree from Columbia. He received his Ph.D. in economics from the Brookings Institution (undated). He then served in the U.S. Army, stationed in the south. He then moved to Mexico, where he conducted research on rural education and served as an adviser to President L√°zaro C√°rdenas. In 1931, he reported to the Wickersham Commission study on Penal Institutions, Probation and Parole (Volume 9). In 1932, he returned to the United States to teach criminology at Cornell University. In 1935 he joined the faculty at Columbia, where he became professor of Latin American history. A notable student at Columbia was Robert J. Alexander, who went on to become professor of history at Rutgers University, specializing in the trade union movement in Latin America and dissident communist political parties. In 1944, Tannenbaum was instrumental in proposing the Columbia University Seminars format; a group of Columbia faculty, other faculty, and students who gathered together in discussion of issues on compelling topics such as peace and war, and other general subjects of concern. He participated in the Seminar on Government in February - May 1945 with J.H. Randall Jr., and Herbert W. Schneider with his essays \\"The Coordinate State\\" and \\"The Balance of Power in Society,\\" published in his book of the same title. Twenty years after, his book on the Columbia Seminars was published in 1965, A Community of Scholars, and 39 seminars were conducted by that time. He retired from Columbia University in 1965. He died in New York City in 1969. Legacy Tannenbaum helped formulate legislation that established the Farm Security Administration. His conception of the \\"Dramatization Of Evil\\" led to the further development of the symbolic interactionist labeling theory, widely used in both sociology and social psychology. Summarizing this theory's impact, Kerry Townsend has stated, \\"Frank Tannenbaum‚Äôs theory, dramatization of evil, explains the making of a criminal and the lure of criminal behavior.\\" Townsend places Tannenbaum's theoretical thought within the theory of \\"Symbolic Interactionism,\\" whose perspective emphasizes \\"individual levels of interaction, began to emerge spearheaded by the writings of George Herbert Mead and Charles Horton Cooley,\\" which formed the basis of Societal Reaction theories of which Tannenbaum's form part. Tannenbaum's theory remains important in criminology studies at universities including Florida State University, the University of Maryland Works =Books= * The Labor Movement: Its Conservative Functions and Social, Consequences.

Van Aerssen was born in Antwerp. From 1611 he was Heer van Spijk (Lord of Spijk, sometimes spelt Spyck) and was the father of Frans van Aarsens. For many years, he was registrat to the States-General. He died in The Hague. He was almost certainly the son of an Antwerp courtier, who was favoured by the court at Brussels. Von Aerssen himself in 1574 entered office as a city secretary of Brussels. In the following year he was appointed the pensioner of the city. Although in religious matters he was known as a tolerant man, he was against a reconciliation with Philip II of Spain. Von Aerssen travelled often, and on the day of the murder of William of the Silent, he was also in Den Haag. In 1584 he was sent with other delegates to France. The goal of this delegation was to negotiate with the French king Henry IV over the sovereignty of Dutch Republic. Cornelis van Aerssen was in the same year appointed an official of the Dutch Estates-General, but continued to live in Brussels, which raised the suspicion that he was plotting with the Spanish. He played a leading role in the Orange-reformed party. When the Spanish general Francisco de Mendoza was in Woerden and Den Haag as a Dutch prisoner after the Battle of Nieuwpoort, and wanted to start peace negotiations, Van Aerssen was named a Dutch representative alongside the Land's Advocate of Holland Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and the Franciscan Johan Meyen sent by Archduke Albrecht. Van Aerssen negotiated with the Spanish envoy, and on 4 May 1602 agreed an 8-month cease-fire. Oldenbarnevelt, at the head of the party aiming for peace, welcomed this, as he feared the growing power of the Dutch Stadtholder Maurice, Prince of Orange.

It is known for its diamond-mining operations. Founded after 1927, the name is Dutch and means 'small sea', referring to a lagoon at the mouth of the Buffels River. The Buffels River \\"flows\\" through Kleinsee, but most of the time it is just a dry river bed and only flows approximately every ten years. The Primary School does not exist anymore, it is now a Center for learning and Development Its population size generally consisted of around 2,000 residents, but was considerably reduced by the down-scaling of mining activities in 2009. Legend tells that a teacher by the name De Villagers from the local farm school had built a new school. He was looking for lime deposits to whitewash the walls. Accompanied by a builder called Alberts he kicked at a mound in the veld and then dislodged a diamond with the toe of his shoe. It was then recorded as the first alluvial diamond found about a year after the discovery of the deposits at Alexander Bay. Within three weeks De Villagers and Alberts collected diamonds worth ¬£600 which was a small fortune in those days. They then sold their claims to an exploration company which eventually opened up the Kleinsee 'crater', reminiscent of the 'Big Hole' at Kimberley. This area then become known as the Diamond Coast.

The ride has three lift hills with brief elements between each that wind through a wooded, hilly landscape. This is a family coaster that is named after Dahlonega, Georgia, a village in northern Georgia that was a center of the gold rush of 1828, the first gold rush in the United States of America.  Operational information  When opened in 1967, the Dahlonega Mine Train had the capability to run four trains at once, the reason for its high capacity. In the mid-1990s, however, the O. D. Hopkins Company rebuilt and refurbished the ride, replacing some wooden supports with steel, retracking and a fully computerized control system. This new system is not capable of running four trains at once (three is the current maximum number of trains during normal operation). Thus, the stated capacity of 2200 riders per hour is inaccurate. With three trains, the capacity is 1300 riders per hour, with two trains it is 800 riders per hour and with one train it is 500 riders per hour. As with most modern roller coasters, a block system keeps trainsets moving and prevents trains from colliding with each other. Rarely, trains will \\"roll back\\" into the tunnel from the end of the station platform. The control program is set up to handle this problem so that another train cannot collide with the stalled train. When this happens, guests are unloaded in the tunnel (which has lights and a stairway for such an event) and a winch pulls the empty train back into the station. Trains feature a single lap bar in each row actuated by depressing a foot pedal near the front of each car, done by a station attendant. Unlike many roller coasters, though, there are no upstop wheels to prevent the trains from leaving the track; instead there is only a flange (upstop pad) which achieves the same result. This is common on \\"mine train\\" type roller coasters.  Ride experience  The ride begins with the train leaving the station passing under a walkway, going down a small hill and turning left into the enclosed transfer track area. From there it turns right and climbs the first lift. After clearing the lift hill, the train turns right and descends into a trench while completing a U-turn. This is the \\"figure 8\\" area of the track. After that, it rides through the \\"b\\" dips featuring 2 camel back humps. Then the train turns left then right and approaches the second lift hill. Next, it climbs the second lift and turns left into the \\"mini horseshoe\\", which leads into a right turn downward spiral. From the spiral, it rides over the \\"c\\" dip, turns right and climbs the third lift hill. After clearing the third, and final lift, it turns left into the \\"big horseshoe\\" and enters an elevated barn enclosure. When the train nears the end of the enclosure, it descends into a tunnel, reaching its actual top speed of 35 mph and completes an elongated figure \\"S\\" shaped element, starting with a left turn (left right left). From there it pops back above ground, slightly turns left and slowly enters back into the station.  Tunnel  The tunnel has flooded on occasion over the years. A massive flood occurred in September 2009, which covered a large portion of the entire property.

Description Tokiwa-s≈ç was a Japanese style no-frills apartment building, two stories high, built of wood. It was one of the pre-war buildings which survived the fire bombing of Tokyo during World War II and became part of the nucleus of the Minami Nagasaki residential area of Toshima ward. It had no baths, only cold water sinks and toilets. Residents went to local sent≈ç bath houses, the Tsuru-yu and the Akebono-yu (now modern condominiums).Toshima ward pamphlet The building existed as a sort of atelier from 1952 to 1982. It was demolished in 1982. It is now the site of Nihon Kajo Publishing. Notable residents and relation to manga and anime The second floor of this building housed many young budding artists in the late 1950s to the early 1960s, including Osamu Tezuka between 1953 and 1954. Residents included Hiroo Terada (1953‚Äì1957), Fujiko Fujio (1954‚Äì1961), Suzuki Shinichi (1955‚Äì1956), Naoya Moriyasu (1956), Shotaro Ishinomori (1956‚Äì1961), Fujio Akatsuka (1956‚Äì1961), Norio Yokota (1958‚Äì1961), Hideko Mizuno (1958) and George Yamaguchi (1960‚Äì1962). Tezuka offered a room to the writing duo Fujiko Fujio when he was moving out. Fujiko Fujio would make similar gestures themselves, offering rooms to rookie artists whenever one was made available, including to Akatsuka and Ishinomori. The business of manga production today in Japan has a prototype in the collaborative activities pioneered at Tokiwa-s≈ç. According to Tam Bing Man (one of the acting duo), who was an assistant of Osamu Tezuka in earliest days, Tezuka first introduced this production system employing many assistants to make manga, in order to meet the deadlines of publishing in weekly manga magazines. This model of several assistants helping a main artist is still used today, providing young manga artists with training. Related, similar buildings and museum Toshima City's Culture and Tourism Division built a bronze monument titled in Minami-Nagasaki Hanasaki Koen public park in April 2009. Standing from where the original building stood, it consists of self-portraits and autographs of 10 former Tokiwa-s≈ç residents, with a small model of the building on top. Townspeople initially imagined a monument featuring famous characters created by Tokiwa-s≈ç residents, such as Astro Boy and Doraemon, but had negotiation troubles with copyrights. In 2012, the publishing house that stands on the original plot installed a stone monument to Tokiwa-s≈ç on its grounds with a replica of the building on top. The Tokiwa-s≈ç Project was started in 2006 to help aspiring manga artists begin their professional careers, including offering housing assistance. By 2016, they have helped more than 60 artists make their debut. Tokiwa-s≈ç Manga Museum, 2020 Kyoto's Kamigy≈ç ward refurbished a century-old, two-story row house into their own Tokiwa-s≈ç for aspiring manga artists. It was unveiled on August 23, 2013. In February 2015, the Niigata City government announced plans to open a rent-free house for up-and-coming female manga artists modeled after Tokiwa-s≈ç called Komachi House. Instructors from the Japan Animation and Manga College will give lessons to tenants of the house in Ch≈´≈ç-ku, in return for the artists working on projects led by the city government. In July 2016, the Toshima ward government announced plans to build a replica of Tokiwa-s≈ç in Minami-Nagasaki Hanasaki Koen public park, a three-minute walk from the original, with a museum dedicated to manga and anime inside that was scheduled to open in March 2020. The Toshima government planned to spend between 200 million and 300 million yen (~US $1.98 million to $2.98 million) on the project with plans created by a committee of people involved in the original Tokiwa-s≈ç, led by Machiko Satonaka. Delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, the museum officially opened on July 7, 2020 and recreates the original building meticulously, down to fake mold.

The company is the largest franchised moving company in the United States with more than 340 locations. History The company was founded in the early 1980s by Lansing brothers Brig Sorber and Jon Sorber. Using an old '66 Ford pickup truck, they performed moves to earn extra spending money. Their mother, Mary Ellen Sheets, drew the logo for their new company and that stick-figure logo still represents Two Men and a Truck today. Sheets took over the business when her sons left for college. In 1985, she purchased a truck for $350 and hired a pair of movers. This is the only money Sheets personally invested in the company. A fellow panelist at a university business seminar in 1988 suggested Sheets consider franchising. After further research, the first franchise was awarded in 1989. Franchising The initial franchise fee is $50,000; there is also an ongoing royalty of 6% of revenue. As of 2017, there are 262 franchises in the United States and 31 in other countries.

He had been watching his older brother and cousin lift weights together in order to become stronger for their wrestling competitions. He acquired a rusty York barbell, as a hand-me-down from his brother Ray, and quickly set about to become Mr. America. It wasn‚Äôt long before he was absolutely smitten with the iron game and training a full seven days a week.  Bodybuilding career  By the time Padilla was eighteen, he was ready to compete. He won the Mr. Rochester contest in 1970 while still in high school. It was his first show, and he took home the first place trophy. The only question in Padilla's mind after that was,‚ÄùWhen is the next show?‚Äù He entered a lot of other smaller competitions in the upstate New York area - Mr. Buffalo and Mr. Syracuse. After establishing himself in the local arena, he progressed to participating in both the Junior Mr. America and the Mr. America contests. He finished in the top twenty of both competitions. Padilla then entered the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) World Championships in the lightweight division. He recalled, \\"I lost to a guy who didn‚Äôt even shave his legs!\\" This defeat was a turning point. After the show, the judges were ‚Äúkind‚Äù enough to inform him that, in their studied opinion, he had a great physique but, at 5' 2\\" tall, was much too short to compete. After that AAU show, Padilla decided to compete in the International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB) instead. His first contest was the 1975 IFBB Mr. USA. It was held at the old Madison Square Garden in New York City. It was the first time that the 23-year-old had ever seen bodybuilders from the West Coast. They included Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbu, Robby Robinson and many others. To his great surprise, he not only won his lightweight division, but also took the overall title. It was during that impressive first outing with the IFBB that Padilla first met Joe Weider. Weider introduced himself to the \\"kid from Rochester\\" backstage at the contest, telling Padilla that he had a great physique and that he could do very well in the sport. Weider also invited him to train in California. Padilla arrived in Los Angeles just in time to take part in the filming of Pumping Iron. He trained for three months to prepare to compete in the lightweight division in the upcoming Mr. Universe competition in South Africa for which he had qualified to compete based on his earlier Mr. USA win. Disaster struck in Pretoria. Just minutes before the Universe show was to begin, Padilla was told that he could not compete. The IFBB decided that they‚Äôd rather have two heavyweights represent the United States - Ken Waller and Mike Katz - and one middleweight, Robby Robinson. Their reasoning was that since Katz was retiring, they should let him try to win the Universe for the last time. Padilla quickly maneuvered to get a spot on Portugal‚Äôs team. He felt confident that he was in a position to win in the lightweight category and was determined to compete. After all of his pre- contest preparation, travel to South Africa and hours of participation in the filming of the movie, he would try to take home the title, even under Portugal‚Äôs flag. The IFBB would have none of this. Padilla was disqualified by them in order to avoid what they perceived as the ‚Äúembarrassment‚Äù that his potential win for Portugal would cause the organization. Padilla now exists as a visual footnote in Pumping Iron. The film makers were forced to cut the majority of his scenes from the film because the IFBB did not want the whole incident depicted in the movie. Bouncing back the following year, Padilla competed in the IFBB Universe, but was defeated by Mohamed Makkawy. In 1977, he again entered the IFBB fray and competed in the Mr. America. This time he walked off the stage with a trophy for both his weight class and the overall title. It was the first time a lightweight had beaten both a middle and heavyweight for the overall title. That same year, Padilla won the lightweight title at the IFBB Mr. Universe. He is one of only two men in the history of the sport to win both the America and the Universe in the same year, the other being Frank Zane. Padilla followed up with a great showing at the 1977 Mr. Olympia. He was in the top five in both his weight class and in the overall standings. Danny was inducted into Joe Weider's IFBB Bodybuilding Hall Of Fame in 2009.

The first species to be described was Calliope subterraneus (now Paraleptamphopus subterraneus) which was named by Charles Chilton in 1882. George M. Thomson described a second species in 1885, as Pherusa coerulea (now Paraleptamphopus caeruleus). Although no other species have yet been formally described, it is thought that many more undescribed species exist. Paraleptamphopus subterraneus In 1882, Charles Chilton collected specimens of P. subterraneus from groundwater at his farm near Eyreton, Canterbury, and later obtained specimens from various depths in Lincoln, Winchester and St. Albans. These animals were colourless and lacked eyes, and were described as a new species in the genus Calliope. Chilton later acquired specimens from the Porter River at Castle Hill, Canterbury, from Lake Wakatipu, Otago, from Lake Taupo on the North Island and from Otautau, Southland. Paraleptamphopus caeruleus George M. Thomson described a new species in the genus Pherusa in 1885, from specimens collected in a mountain stream in the Old Man Range of central Otago at an altitude of . Further populations were not found for several years, but were later discovered at a variety of locations, including \\"the bog-water on top of Swampy Hill, near Dunedin\\", Otautau (together with P. subterraneus), Ruapuke Island, Drummond, and near Invercargill. Unlike P. subterraneus, P. caeruleus is a deep blue colour, which it retains even after prolonged preservation. Chilton concluded that P. caeruleus was the form from which P. subterraneus evolved. Undescribed species More recent work has unearthed a great deal of genetic variability within the specimens ascribed to the genus, which is likely to result in the description of a number of new species. The centre of diversity is in the upper West Coast of the South Island, and the genus appears to be absent from the eastern portion of the North Island, (the Bay of Plenty, East Cape, and northern Hawke's Bay), presumably due to a recent history of volcanism.

G. Wodehouse. Reggie is a young man-about-town who gets drawn into trouble trying to help his pals. He is considered to be an early prototype for Bertie Wooster, who, along with his valet Jeeves, is one of Wodehouse's most famous creations. The Reggie Pepper stories were originally published in magazines. Four were included in My Man Jeeves (1919), and the other stories appeared in later miscellaneous collections. The stories were not all collected in one short story collection until they were featured, along with several early Jeeves stories, in the 1997 collection Enter Jeeves. Two of the four Reggie Pepper stories published in My Man, Jeeves were later rewritten by Wodehouse as Jeeves stories, and one was rewritten as a Mr. Mulliner story. Inspiration Reggie Pepper was inspired by the English \\"dude\\" roles that Wodehouse saw on the New York stage, and by the stock Edwardian aristocrat parts that Wodehouse had seen played by comedian George Grossmith Jr.Wodehouse (2013), A Life in Letters, p. 72, stated by editor Sophie Ratcliffe. Life and character Reggie Pepper is a young gentleman who does not do any work, having inherited a great deal of wealth from his uncle Edward Pepper of Pepper, Wells, & Co., the colliery people. He went to Oxford with Freddie Meadowes and Bill Shoolbred. In \\"Rallying Round Old George\\", he has a valet named Harold Voules, though he fires Voules by the end of the story. Later, in \\"Concealed Art\\", he employs a valet named Wilberforce.Garrison (1991), pp. 141‚Äì142. Reggie sometimes meets his friends at his club, which is unnamed. (The stories in which he appears were written before Wodehouse had invented the Drones Club). Reggie is not ambitious and is content simply to watch traffic from the window of his club, though he is also curious about the affairs of his friends, as he states in \\"Concealed Art\\". Not interested in working himself, he respects others who work. In the stories, Reggie tries to help his friends with their problems. Despite being considered not very intelligent by his friends, he occasionally experiences a flash of inspiration, which he sometimes refers to as getting a \\"brain-wave\\".Reggie gets what he calls a \\"brain-wave\\" (or \\"brain wave\\", or \\"brainwave\\") in \\"Helping Freddie\\", \\"Disentangling Old Percy\\", \\"Rallying Round Old George\\", \\"Concealed Art\\", and \\"The Test Case\\". His friend Bobbie Cardew gets a brain- wave in \\"Absent Treatment\\". The only story that does not mention brain-waves is \\"Doing Clarence a Bit of Good\\". However, his well-intentioned interference generally backfires somehow. Reggie himself notes this, stating \\"Doesn't some poet or philosopher fellow say that it‚Äôs when our intentions are best that we always make the most poisonous bloomers? I can‚Äôt put my hand on the passage, but you‚Äôll find it in Shakespeare or somewhere, I‚Äôm pretty certain. Anyhow, it‚Äôs always that way with me.\\" Reggie also says something similar at the end of \\"The Test Case\\". Continually unlucky in love, Reggie states in \\"Rallying Round Old George\\" that he has been turned down dozens of times. He was once in love with Elizabeth Shoolbred and was engaged to her for about a week, but she married the artist Clarence Yeardsley instead. He also came close to marrying Ann Selby in \\"The Test Case\\". Reggie is not engaged or married at the end of the stories, though he does not seem troubled by this. He is ultimately thankful that he did not marry Elizabeth Yeardsley, who proves to be rather manipulative, or Ann Selby, since she is a strong-minded girl who would have tried to change him. The American editions of the Reggie Pepper stories differ slightly from the British editions. In the American editions, Reggie Pepper appears to be American and lives in New York instead of London. Another difference is that the money he inherits from his uncle came from a safety razor company rather than a coal company. Prototype for Bertie Wooster Reggie Pepper served as a prototype for Wodehouse's later character Bertie Wooster.Wodehouse (2013), A Life in Letters, p. 74. According to editor Sophie Ratcliffe, Reggie Pepper was \\"the prototype for Bertie Wooster\\". In a letter to a fan also named Wooster who asked Wodehouse about the origin of Bertie Wooster's name, Wodehouse wrote, \\"I can't remember how I got the name Wooster. I think it may have been from a serial in the old Captain, where one of the characters was called Worcester. The odd thing is that the Bertie W. character started out as Reggie Pepper, and I don't know why I changed the name.\\" Notably, it is Bertie's valet Jeeves who would eventually be named \\"Reggie\\" like Reggie Pepper, and Bertie Wooster received the middle name \\"Wilberforce\\", which is the name of Reggie Pepper's valet.Jeeves's first name was revealed in Much Obliged, Jeeves (1971); Bertie's middle name was revealed in The Mating Season (1949) and also mentioned in Much Obliged, Jeeves. The Reggie Pepper stories \\"Absent Treatment\\" title illustration by Wallace Morgan (Collier's, 1911) Reggie Pepper appears in the following stories: =\\"Absent Treatment\\"= *UK: Strand Magazine, March 1911 *US: Collier's Weekly, 26 August 1911 ;Plot Reggie Pepper's friend Bobbie Cardew, who was very forgetful at the time when the story takes place, invites Reggie to his home for dinner. Reggie sees that Bobbie's wife Mary is very well dressed. Her manner is strained. The following day, Bobbie sullenly tells Reggie that the previous day was his and Mary's first wedding anniversary. Bobbie's forgetfulness continues to create problems between him and Mary, though he does remember to give Reggie money he owes him, feeling it is important to pay a debt. Reggie says Bobbie should try to remember dates for his wife, but Bobbie does not think dates really matter. For months, Bobbie continues to forget things despite warnings from Reggie. One day in their club, a distressed Bobbie tells Reggie that Mary has left him. She wrote him a letter saying that she will only return when Bobbie cares enough to remember her birthday, which Bobbie has forgotten. After Reggie and Bobbie discuss other ideas for determining her birthday, Bobbie suggests they search through astrology books that describe the character of people born in certain months to find a description that matches Mary. This plan is unsuccessful, as each character description is applicable to Mary. Bobbie thinks hard about the problem for weeks, and Reggie observes that Bobbie is becoming more mindful as a result of his efforts. Eventually, Bobbie remembers the show he and Mary saw on her last birthday at the Coliseum, narrowing the search down to six days in May. In the middle of the night, Bobbie calls Reggie, waking him up, and says they saw a matin√©e, which means the show was on Wednesday or Saturday. Reggie reminds him that there are daily matin√©es at the Coliseum, which disappoints Bobbie. Reggie remembers that he had lunch with Bobbie that day, which Bobbie paid for. Bobbie looks in his cheque-book and happily discovers their lunch was on the eighth. Reggie then calls a hotel, and asks to speak to Mrs. Cardew. He tells her that Bobbie has remembered her birthday. Initially excited, she asks if Bobbie has been worried. Proud of their scheme, Reggie replies that Bobbie has been very worried, and is surprised when Mary berates him for letting Bobbie become so concerned. In the end, Reggie notes that he is still Bobbie's friend but is scorned by Mary, despite having acted with the best intentions. The British edition of the story takes place in London while the American edition takes place in New York. In both versions, Reggie's wealth was inherited from his uncle, though in the British edition, the money came from the coal industry, whereas in the American version, it came from the safety razor industry. The American version is slightly longer. =\\"Helping Freddie\\"= *UK: Strand Magazine, September 1911 *US: Pictorial Review, March 1912 (as \\"Lines and Business\\") The story was later rewritten as a Jeeves story. (See \\"Fixing it for Freddie\\".) =\\"Disentangling Old Percy\\"= Reggie Pepper and Florence Craye in \\"Disentangling Old Percy\\", illustrated by Alfred Leete (Strand, 1912) *UK: Strand Magazine, August 1912 *US: Collier's Weekly, 30 March 1912 (as \\"Disentangling Old Duggie\\") ;Plot The well-meaning young gentleman Reggie Pepper advises his friend Percy Craye to consult a palmist named Dorothea. Though initially reluctant, Percy is ultimately happy after meeting Dorothea, who is really a widow named Mrs. Dorothy Darrell. Percy makes money after being encouraged by her optimistic reading and thinks she is wonderful. Three weeks later, Florence Craye, Percy's older sister, tells Reggie that Percy is engaged to the palmist. Florence is class-conscious and strongly disapproves of the match. Hoping to help Percy, Reggie suggests that if Florence acts as if she approves the match and invites Percy and Dorothea to the family's country house, Percy will realize that he does not belong with Dorothy and will end the engagement. Florence likes the idea and tells Reggie to come to the house with Percy and Dorothy. Reggie informs Percy about the plan; Percy is confident that his love for Dorothy will prevail. At the Crayes' country house, Percy really does change his mind about the engagement under Florence's influence, and Dorothy leaves for London. Back in London, Reggie sees Percy's older brother Edwin, Lord Weeting, who is unusually happy. Florence is upset after learning that Edwin has been spending time with Dorothy, and orders Reggie to talk to Dorothy. Reggie learns from Dorothy that she is becoming close to Edwin to get revenge on Florence, though she is also genuinely helping Edwin learn to enjoy life after being oppressed by Florence. Dorothy does not deny that she is engaged to Edwin. Florence commands Reggie to tell her widowed father, Mr. Craye, Lord Worplesdon, that Edwin is engaged to a palm reader. Reggie goes to Worplesdon's club and tells him that Edwin is engaged to a palmist, but Worplesdon does not seem to disapprove. Edwin arrives, and Worplesdon sees that Edwin is happier than before. Worplesdon and Edwin have fun in London. To avoid Florence, Reggie goes to Nice in France. He is surprised to find Edwin there, enjoying himself. He also sees Dorothy, who became friends with Lord Worplesdon after helping Edwin enjoy life. Dorothy says that she hopes someday to win Florence over because she wants all her children to love her. This confuses Reggie. Dorothy explains that she considers Lord Worplesdon's children her own since she married Lord Worplesdon. The British version of the story, \\"Disentangling Old Percy\\", takes place in London, while the American version of the story, \\"Disentangling Old Duggie\\", is set in New York. Reggie Pepper's friend is named Percy Craye in the English version and Douglas or \\"Duggie\\" Craye in the American version. In the British version, the elder Craye has the title \\"Lord Worplesdon\\" and Edwin is \\"Lord Weeting\\", while in the American version, the family lives near Philadelphia and is not part of the British peerage. =\\"Rallying Round Old George\\"= *UK: Strand Magazine, December 1912 *US: Collier's Weekly, 27 September 1913 (as \\"Brother Alfred\\") The story was later rewritten as a Mr. Mulliner story. (See \\"George and Alfred\\".) =\\"Doing Clarence A Bit of Good\\"= *UK: Strand Magazine, May 1913 *US: Pictorial Review, April 1914 (as \\"Rallying Round Clarence\\") The story was later rewritten as a Jeeves story.

Archie has not sold any paintings. He confesses to Reggie that to earn a living, he illustrates slapstick cartoons about the \\"Doughnut\\" family in a magazine called Funny Slices. Reggie enjoys the cartoons and congratulates Archie, but Archie is afraid of telling his fianc√©e, the spiritual poet Eunice Nugent, that he draws cartoons. Meeting Eunice, Reggie quickly perceives that she is indeed serious and spiritual. He thinks Archie should not tell her about the cartoons and suggests that Archie claim his money comes from B. and O. P. Rails, a company that Archie really has invested in. Archie follows this advice and soon Archie and Eunice get married. Around seven months later, Archie comes to Reggie in distress. The value of B. O. and P. stock has plummeted, and Archie has lost his savings, but his true problem is that he cannot explain his continuing income to Eunice. Archie is unwilling to tell her about the money he makes from cartoons, so the couple lives off Eunice's small private means and moves to a less expensive residence. Reggie thinks hard about the problem, his manner becoming so distrait as a result that he inadvertently hurts the feelings of his valet Wilberforce, which Reggie makes up for by tipping him two pounds. Eventually, Reggie comes up with an idea. He calls Archie and tells him to claim he obtained his money by selling his painting \\"The Coming of Summer\\" to the American millionaire J. Bellingwood Brackett, who lives in London and often buys artwork. Archie follows through on this plan and decides to tell Eunice he was paid two thousand pounds, a remarkably large sum. A newspaper reports that Brackett paid two thousand pounds for Archie's painting. Eunice had told the papers about the story. Renshaw Liggett, Brackett's representative, visits the Ferguson home to tell Archie to publicly deny the story. Liggett leaves after Archie agrees. He reveals to Eunice that his money comes from the Doughnut cartoons, which he shows to her. Surprising Reggie and Archie, Eunice finds the cartoon hilarious. She admits that she lied about her private means and is in fact an advertisement copywriter. Archie and Eunice share a heartfelt embrace, and Reggie sidles out. In the American edition, the story takes place in New York instead of London and Archie's painting is reportedly sold for ten thousand dollars rather than two thousand pounds. =\\"The Test Case\\"= \\"The Test Case\\" illustration by Lewis Baumer (Pearson's, 1915) *UK: Pearson's Magazine, December 1915 *US: Illustrated Sunday Magazine, 12 December 1915 ;Plot Reggie states that he was once in love with Ann Selby. Though he is now glad that she refused him, he feels that she did not treat him fairly. He then recounts the following story. Not for the first time, Reggie proposes to Ann Selby. Instead of refusing him as usual, she says that Reggie seems brainless but might have potential. However, she is hesitant about marriage because of what is happening between her sister Hilda and Hilda's husband, Reggie's friend Harold Bodkin. Harold often praises his deceased first wife Amelia, and every evening he goes into the studio room at the top of their house to meditate on Amelia's memory and lay flowers in front of her portrait. Hilda feels unappreciated, but pretends not to mind. Reggie assures Ann that he is not like Harold. Ann agrees to marry Reggie if Reggie does something to prove his intelligence. To prove himself and to help a friend, Reggie decides to address the situation with Harold and Hilda. He plans to make Harold overdo his meditations on Amelia so that Harold will get tired of it. Reggie talks to Harold, who is oblivious that Hilda is upset, and persuades Harold to postpone dinner in order to spend more time with Amelia's portrait each evening. This displeases Harold's butler Ponsonby since he needs to work longer. Reggie also gets Harold to invite Amelia's ill-mannered brother Percy to the house. Lastly, Reggie intends to use a wedge to jam the studio room door and trap Harold there for a few hours. After hearing someone enter the studio room, Reggie jams the door shut with a wedge and then dines out, returning a few hours later. He sees Ann, who says that Hilda, fed up with Harold's latest actions, announced she would leave Harold. Reggie explains that he suggested Harold lengthen his meditations and invite Percy as part of a larger plan. Ann disapproves, but notes that Hilda's actions prompted Harold to change. Earlier that day, Harold called Ponsonby and told him to take down Amelia's portrait. Harold then appears and says that he cannot find Ponsonby. Reggie, realizing where Ponsonby is, is struck speechless. Harold finds the studio door locked and hears Ponsonby's voice. Harold lets him out, and Ponsonby gives notice before heading to the pantry to eat. Admitting that he shut Ponsonby in the room, Reggie explains that he was trying to trap Harold. Ann thinks that Reggie is a practical joker and denounces him. Reggie tries to defend himself to Ann, but is unsuccessful. In the British edition, the story is set in England, and Harold and Hilda live in Hertfordshire. In the American edition, the story takes place in America, and Harold and Hilda live in Long Island.

The company specializes in barcode scanners, mobile computers, RFID systems and Wireless LAN infrastructure. Symbol Technologies is a wholly owned subsidiary of Zebra Technologies, and is headquartered in Holtsville, New York, on Long Island. History =Before 2000= The company was co-founded in 1973 by Jerome Swartz and physicist Shelley A. Harrison.Funding Universe history of Symbol Technologies At that time, the company focused on handheld laser based scanning of bar codes. Under Swartz's leadership the company became a leader in handheld laser bar code scanning devices. The company focused heavily on the retail industry and began to get involved in inventory management. These activities typically required people to scan items where they are stored and as such needed to be mobile. Symbol began to make small computers that could store data scanned to take inventory counts remotely and then upload the information gathered to a host system. This was the rationale for the purchase of MSI - a mobile computer company that was headquartered in southern California. The mobile computers being manufactured at the time relied on static memory (in this case SRAM) for execution space and general storage. SRAM was extremely expensive and the team determined that it would be an improvement to use a radio to allow the mobile computer to be untethered but connected to the host system. A thin client architecture was adopted in conjunction with a spread spectrum radio network. The Enterprise Mobility Management market was dominated by Symbol Technologies and Telxon, Inc. Most notably, these two companies serviced major retailers such as Wal-Mart, Kroger, Safeway, Federated and others. A notable turning point occurred in 1994 with a competition for business at Kroger. Symbol Technologies and Telxon were operating radio networks in the 2.4 GHz ISM bands. IEEE 802.11 was not yet ratified, so Symbol and Telxon were free to define competing standards of communication at this frequency band. Symbol settled on frequency hopping as the most robust, agile and interference- tolerant approach to data communications while Telxon selected direct sequence technology which they felt afforded higher transfer speeds with adequate interference immunity. Kroger ordered a head-to-head comparison test. Ultimately and not decisively, Kroger chose Telxon. At about the same time, the IEEE decided to adopt the direct sequence approach in its IEEE 802.11b standard. The ratification of IEEE 802.11b was a huge blow to the Symbol team which now had to reconfigure and engineer a direct sequence radio system. This was accomplished with great pains and IEEE 802.11b became a reality in the industrial and commercial markets far before the radios were available to the consumer market. The addition of a radio to a mobile device was roughly estimated to have a real value of between $500 and $1000 per unit. This was paid by enterprise class customers that desperately needed this feature to accomplish their operations. Later on Symbol started to sell the radios as PC Cards as a stand-alone product to various OEMs and private label customers. These included 3Com, Nokia and Intel. The Symbol team had temporarily dominated the IEEE 802.11b market. Telxon was facing difficulties and, in the meantime, Intel, Apple Inc. and Cisco were looking at the technology to see how they would use this to their commercial advantage. Cisco investigated the acquisition of various manufacturers of wireless gear to augment their commanding position in the wired infrastructure field. Cisco performed due diligence with both Symbol and Telxon, deciding to purchase the Aironet component of Telxon that designed and manufactured the radios. The Cisco purchase of Telxon's Aironet division marked the inflection point of the market moving from a specialized, esoteric market to a mass consumer and enterprise market. In June 1998, Telxon rejected a hostile takeover bid of $668 million made by Symbol.TELXON REJECTS LATEST OFFER FROM SYMBOL TECHNOLOGIESTelxon's Board Rejects Increased Symbol Bid The ensuing proxy battle lasted two years, and in December 2000 Symbol was able to complete the takeover at a much lower price of $465 million.Symbol to Acquire Telxon in a Stock-for-Stock TransactionTelxon Stockholders Approve Merger with Symbol Technologies In 2004 Symbol acquired Matrics, helping the company to push further into the RFID field. =Accounting fraud and acquisition by Motorola= In 2002, Tomo Razmilovic, who succeeded Swartz as CEO in 2000, abruptly retired in the midst of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into Symbol's accounting practices. A few months later, an internal inquiry revealed a wide-ranging accounting fraud that had begun in 1998 and only ended in early 2002. Following this revelation, Symbol cooperated fully with the SEC investigation, as well as with a separate federal criminal probe by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. On June 3, 2004, Razmilovic and seven other former Symbol executives were indicted on charges that they orchestrated a wide-ranging scheme to inflate the company's sales and profits. It included several types of fraud, such as channel stuffing (booking sales to wholesalers and distributors as final sales to customers), candy deals (selling products to distributors with no matching customer orders and then buying the products back), use of tango sheets (records of how much revenues had to be inflated to match quarterly targets) and use of cookie jar reserves (declaring nonrecurring expenses that far exceeded likely expenses). On the same day, Razmilovic and 10 other former executives were sued by the SEC for the fraud. In late 2002, Symbol restated almost four years of earnings from 1998 to 2001, in the process erasing $234 million in revenue and $325 million in net income. It also paid $37 million to settle the SEC charges and $138 million to settle numerous shareholder suits.SEC suit against SymbolSEC release announcing penalties against Razmilovic Eventually, four former executives pleaded guilty, and seven former executives settled SEC charges against them. Several of those who pleaded guilty stated under oath that Razmilovic was the mastermind of the fraud. Razmilovic fled to Sweden, where he has citizenship, shortly before his indictment. He remains a fugitive as of 2017; he claims he will not voluntarily return to face the charges against him because he does not believe he can get a fair trial in the United States. Sweden will not give him up for extradition because it does not extradite suspected white-collar criminals outside the European Union. Symbol never recovered from the fraud, and in 2007 was acquired by Motorola for $3.9 billion. The company essentially took over Motorola's Enterprise division; it was far larger than the pre-merger division.Meyer, David. Motorola buys Symbol Technologies for ¬£2bn. ZDNet, 2006-09-19. Symbol remained part of Motorola Solutions, the legal successor to the old Motorola, after the company spun off its mobile phone division as Motorola Mobility. =Acquisition by Zebra Technologies= In October 2014 Zebra Technologies acquired Motorola Solutions' Enterprise business which included Symbol Technologies for $3.45 billion in cash.

It is a grade I listed building of Tudor architure and was recently restored. It is situated, at some considerable distance from the village of Iron Acton and the parish church of St Michael, on Latteridge Lane, Iron Acton, South Gloucestershire, England. The Poyntz family owned the property from 1364 until 1680. Nicholas Poyntz (died 1557) added the East Wing onto the existing moated manor house shortly before 1535. Construction took about 9 months to complete. Subsequently, the wing was lavishly and fashionably decorated to impress Henry VIII. The king and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, stayed in the house in 1535, during a tour of the West Country. Building work continued at Acton Court until Nicholas died in 1557. When the direct line of succession ended in 1680, the house was sold. It was reduced in size and converted for use as a tenanted farmhouse. Due to neglect, the house gradually fell into a dilapidated state. By the end of the 20th century, practically only the East Wing survived. However, the neglect resulted in a rare example of Tudor royal state apartments being preserved virtually intact. The house was purchased at auction in 1984 by Eva Dorothy Brown on behalf of the Bristol Visual and Environmental Group (BVEG). An extensive restoration was completed only recently. Prior to the restoration, English Heritage commissioned a comprehensive study, published as K. Rodwell and R. Bell, Acton Court: The evolution of an early Tudor courtier's house (2004).

He held post-doctoral appointments at the University of Durham and University of Cambridge before moving to the Anglo-Australian Observatory, where he played a central role in supporting the 2dF galaxy survey as its instrument scientist.

Glazebrook also developed the open-source Perl Data Language, a perl-based alternative to the commercial IDL. Glazebrook was one of the leaders of the Gemini Deep Deep Survey (GDDS) which measured the evolution of galaxies using Gemini Observatory and the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes.Gemini Observatory - the Gemini Deep Deep Survey The project, along with a number of other studies, determined in 2004 that massive galaxies formed surprisingly early in the distant Universe, explaining why a lot of them appear so remarkably old.Casey Kazan; The early universe puzzle, The Daily Galaxy (15 June 2011). As a whimsical side-project Glazebrook also determined that the bulk-averaged color of the Universe is Cosmic latte. Both pieces of work received wide publicity in the international press. The bulk- averaged color earned some additional international publicity because a software bug had initially suggested a pale turquoise instead of the bland beige. He is also well known in the astronomical community for his pioneering work in developing the baryon oscillation technique to use the distribution of galaxies as a probe of dark energy. After his move to Australia he played a leading role in the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey between 2006 and 2011.

The others are Man (Wen; Êñá), Hau (Hou; ‰æØ), Pang (Peng; ÂΩ≠) and Liu (Liao; Âªñ). The Tangs are one of the region's oldest families and can trace their lineage back 30 generations in Hong Kong and 86 generations in China. In the New Territories, the clan stands about 25,000 strong. Sharing the same surname as the Deng in China, the Tangs of Hong Kong originated from Jishui of Jiangxi province and are considered to be native Hong Kong people, as they were the first immigrants to settle in what is now Hong Kong from what is now mainland China in the 11th century. Many of the Tangs settled in Kam Tin, New Territories.Johnson, Elizabeth. Recording a Rich Heritage: Research on Hong Kong's \\"New Territories\\" Published by the Leisure & Cultural Services Department Produced by the Hong Kong Heritage Museum 2000 The most famous Tang village is Kat Hing Wai, a walled village with a moat. Kat Hing Wai was the last Punti village to fall under British control after the Six Day War in April 1899.  History  The Tang family is the oldest, largest and most famous of the New Territories' Chinese lineages. It has been settled in the area for just over 900 years and has a long history of local dominance. It has also produced many famous scholars and officials in the tradition of large, wealthy Chinese lineages. The Tangs in Lung Yeuk Tau (), in Fanling, have the strongest claim to the royal descent among their fellow clansmen, because they are the descendants of Tang Lum (), the eldest son of the princess of the southern Song Dynasty (1127‚Äì1279). The father of the princess was Emperor Gaozong of Song (June 12, 1107 ‚Äì November 9, 1187), born Zhao Gou, was the tenth emperor of the Song Dynasty of China, and the first emperor of the Southern Song. He reigned from 1127 to 1162. He fled south after the Jurchens overran Kaifeng in the Jingkang Incident of the Jin‚ÄìSong wars, hence the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty 1127-1279. Gaozong re-established his seat of government in Lin'an (; today's Hangzhou). When the princess took refuge in the south, she was married to Tang Wai-Kap () of Kam Tin by Wai- Kap's father, Tang Yeun-Leung (). Tang Lum, the eldest son of the royal couple moved to Lung Yeuk Tau at the end of the Yuan dynasty. As the clan prospered it further branched out to the neighbouring area, establishing the present-day \\"Five Wais and Six Tsuens\\" within a few hundred years. The \\"Five Wais\\" (walled villages) () are Lo Wai (), Ma Wat Wai (), Wing Ning Wai (), Tung Kok Wai (), also known as Ling Kok Wai (), San Wai (), also called Kun Lung Wai (). The \\"Six Tsuens\\" (villages) () are Ma Wat Tsuen (), Wing Ning Tsuen (), also called Tai Tang (), Tsz Tong Tsuen (), San Uk Tsuen (), Siu Hang Tsuen () and Kun Lung Tsuen ().Antiquities and Monuments Office. Lung Yeuk Tau Heritage Trail  Customs  The Tangs of the area still practise traditional village customs. Apart from the communal worship in spring and autumn and Tin Hau Festival, a lantern lighting ceremony is also held for the new born baby boys on the fifteenth day of the first Lunar month. On the first day of the second Lunar month there are ancestral worship ceremony and vegetarian feast. Moreover, Tai Ping Ching Chiu Festival (meaning \\"the Purest Sacrifice Celebrated for Great Peace\\"), also known locally as dajiao is held once every decade and celebrated by the whole Tang Clan as well as people from the neighbouring villages. The next festival will be held in November 2025. Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall The Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall () is the main ancestral hall of the Tang Clan of Lung Yeuk Tau. It is one of the largest ancestral halls in Hong Kong, it was built in the early 16th century in memory of the founding ancestor, Tang Chung Ling () (1303‚Äì1387), the sixth generation descendant of the clan. It is situated on a site in between Lo Wai and Tsz Tong Tsuen. It is a three-hall building with the \\"dong chung\\" placed at the central hall. The rear hall is divided into three chambers. The central chamber houses the soul tablets of the ancestors of the clan including the soul tablets of the Song princess and her husband Wai-Kap whose posthumous title was Fu Ma () Tang Wai-Kap (husband of a princess). Their soul tablets were elaborately carved with dragon head, which distinguished them from the others. The chamber to the left is dedicated to the ancestors who had made significant contributions to the clan or those who achieved high ranks in the imperial court. The chamber to the right, on the other hand, is for the righteous members of the clan, one of whom is Tang Si- meng, a brave servant who saved the life of his master. In the late 16th century, he was kidnapped with his master. Claiming to be the son of his master, he volunteered to be detained by the kidnappers in exchange for the release of his master to raise ransom. After the departure of his master, he jumped into the sea and sacrificed himself. He was awarded the posthumous title of \\"Loyal Servant\\" and worshiped in this hall. The whole building is decorated with fine wood carvings, polychrome plaster mouldings, and murals of auspicious motifs. Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall was declared a monument in November 1997.

But these devices have been unable to do this without upsetting basic calibration, as all existing video storage and transmission systems are based on CRT primaries, and are hence limited to the CRT gamut. xvYCC-encoded video retains the same color primaries and white point as BT.709, and uses either a BT.601 or BT.709 RGB-to-YCC conversion matrix and encoding. This allows it to travel through existing digital YCC data paths, and any colors within the normal gamut will be compatible. The xvYCC color space permits YCC values that, while within the encoding range of YCC, have chroma values outside the range 16‚Äì240, or that correspond to negative RGB values, and hence would not have previously been valid. These are used to encode more saturated colors by using a greater part of the RGB values that can be encoded in the YCbCr signal compared with those used in Broadcast Safe Level. For example, a cyan that lies outside the basic gamut of the primaries can be encoded as \\"green plus blue minus red\\".. Since the 16-255 Y range is used and since the values of Cb and Cr are only little restricted, a lot of high saturated colors far above the max. 255 RGB space can be encoded. For ex. if YCbCr is 255, 128, 128 in the case of a full level YCbCr encoding (0-255), then the corresponding sRGB is 255, 255, 255 which is the max. luminance encode-able value in this color space. But if Y=255 and Cr and/or Cb are not 128, this codes for the max. luminance but with an added color: minimum one color must necessarily be above 255 and can not be converted to sRGB. Adapted software and hardware must be used during production to not clip the video data levels that are above the sRGB space. This is sadly almost never the case of software working with a RGB core. These extra-gamut colors can then be displayed by a device whose underlying technology is not limited by the standard primaries. In a paper published by Society for Information Display in 2006, the authors mapped the 769 colors in the Munsell Color Cascade to the BT.709 space and to the xvYCC space. 55% of the Munsell colors could be mapped to the sRGB gamut, but 100% of those colors could map to the xvYCC gamut. Deeper hues can be created ‚Äì for example a deeper red by giving the opposing color (cyan) a negative coefficient. A mechanism for signaling xvYCC support and transmitting the gamut boundary definition for xvYCC has been defined in the HDMI 1.3 Specification. No new mechanism is required for transmitting the xvYCC data itself, as it is compatible with HDMI's existing YCbCr formats, but the display needs to signal its readiness to accept the extra-gamut xvYCC values, and the source needs to signal the actual gamut in use to help the display to intelligently adapt extreme colors to its own gamut limitations. This should not be confused with HDMI 1.3's other new color feature, deep color. This is a separate feature that increases the precision of brightness and color information, and is independent of xvYCC. xvYCC is not supported by DVD-Video but is supported by the high-definition recording format AVCHD and PlayStation 3. On January 7, 2013, Sony announced that it would release \\"Mastered in 4K\\" Blu-ray Disc titles which are sourced at 4K and encoded at 1080p. \\"Mastered in 4K\\" Blu-ray Disc titles can be played on existing Blu-ray Disc players and will support a larger color space using xvYCC. On May 30, 2013, Eye IO announced that their encoding technology was licensed by Sony Pictures Entertainment to deliver 4K Ultra HD video. Eye IO encodes their video assets at 3840 x 2160 and includes support for the xvYCC color space.

Born in Dublin as the son of a surgeon he developed an urge to go to Africa and become a professional hunter. Taylor mainly hunted for his own account and had little interest in guiding clients. His parents paid for his passage to Cape Town. In Africa he experimented extensively with different types of rifles and calibers which made him an expert in big game rifles. He is credited with developing the Taylor KO Factor, and authored several books. John Taylor died in 1969 in London. Biography Although Taylor used various firearms for his work as a hunter, he preferred the expensive, British double rifles over anything else, especially when tackling dangerous game. His fondness for such cartridges as the .450/.400 Nitro- Express, .500/.465 Nitro-Express and .375 Holland & Holland Magnum are expressed again and again in his writing. Of the 450/.400 he says,Taylor, John. African Rifles and Cartridges. Georgetown, SC., Small Arms Technical Publishing Company, 1948. Speaking of the .375 Magnum (a cartridge still sold) he writes, Having hunted over thirty years on the African continent, Taylor killed over 1,000 elephants, many of these illegally. Taylor's personal life in later years was one of misfortune. As an alleged homosexual, Taylor was persecuted in Africa in his latter years there and was eventually forced by local authorities to leave Africa due to his continued poaching offences. Taking into account his vast experience as a hunter, as well as his expertise with rifles, Taylor should have had no trouble finding a well paying job as a representative of one of the high end gunmakers in London. However, whispers alluding to Taylor's homosexual past in Africa followed him to England, and he found little work available. Taylor's last years were spent in poverty.

Jennings (May 13, 1925 ‚Äì August 20, 2015) was an American choral conductor and composer. He was the Harry R. and Thora Helseth Tosdal Professor of Music Emeritus and Director Emeritus of the St. Olaf Choir. He was a published arranger, composer, and choral music educator. Biography Jennings grew up in Fairfield and Westport, Connecticut.\\"Kenneth L. Jennings\\" (obituary), Star Tribune', September 12, 2015 He was an alumnus of St. Olaf College and sang as a member of the St. Olaf Choir. He received his master's degree from Oberlin College and his doctorate from the University of Illinois. Jennings was appointed to the faculty of St. Olaf College in 1953, and became the third director of the internationally renowned St. Olaf Choir in 1968, succeeding founder F. Melius Christiansen and his son-successor, Olaf Christiansen. He retired from St. Olaf College in 1990, turning over the podium to his former student, Anton Armstrong. His wife, Carolyn Jennings, is also an emerita professor of music at St. Olaf. Among three children, his son, Mark Jennings, is currently director of Choral Activities at Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri. Jennings died at his home in Northfield, Minnesota, aged 90. Work as a conductor Jennings became noted for guiding and maturing the St. Olaf Choir from an ensemble rooted substantially in its early twentieth century formation to ascend as ranking among the world's most highly respected choral ensembles. A former student and colleague of Olaf Christiansen, Jennings understood and respected the choir's distinct Lutheran tradition in his programming. However, as the third director of the ensemble, he also modified the tradition of programming exclusively unaccompanied music. Jennings prepared the choir to record Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo√© with the Minnesota Orchestra under the direction of Stanis≈Çaw Skrowaczewski, and during his tenure, he arranged for several notable conductors to rehearse and lead the St. Olaf Choir in concert, including Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki, Bach specialist Helmuth Rilling, British organist Simon Preston, and Robert Shaw. Jennings led the choir on twelve international tours, most notably to France (where he led the St. Olaf Choir, Strasbourg Philharmonic and international soloists in Bach's Mass in B minor for the opening concert of the 1972 Strasbourg International Music Festival), Norway (for the Bergen International Festival), and to Seoul, Korea, for the 1988 Summer Olympics Arts Festival. After his retirement from St. Olaf in 1990, he served as a visiting professor and choral conductor at Gustavus Adolphus College and the University of Arizona in Tucson. Jennings served as the guest conductor at anniversary concerts in honor of F. Melius Christiansen (the 125th in 1996 and the 135th in 2006). Publications N.B.: These lists may not be complete. Some works may be out of print or available only as print-on-demand or online downloads. =Compositions= Jennings was known for writing well-crafted choral works for advanced choirs.

Billed as \\"the world's first triple-loop roller coaster\\" when it opened on March 31, 1978, Mindbender has maintained its popularity since its opening. In its 30th anniversary season in 2008, Mindbender was ranked #15 by Amusement Today magazine in its annual Golden Ticket Awards, and was one of only two roller coasters built before 1980 on the list; the other was its \\"fraternal twin,\\" Shockwave, at Six Flags Over Texas. Attraction history Designed by Werner Stengel and built by Anton Schwarzkopf, Mindbender would be the last original roller coaster the park would construct until the arrival of Georgia Scorcher in 1999. Since its debut, Mindbender has had three different color schemes and been counted within three different sections of the park. In its inaugural season, the attraction was part of the USA section and was silver in color. In 1979, Mindbender became part of the new Jolly Roger's Island, itself an offshoot of the USA section. The structure was painted brown during the 1980s. Throughout its first two decades, the trains were silver in color, with a rainbow-colored stripe along both sides. In 1997, when Jolly Roger's Island was converted into Gotham City, Mindbender was painted green to suggest that it was the creation of Batman's arch-enemy, The Riddler. A waterfall under the coaster was dyed green, and occasionally still is (although at times it retains a more natural color). The trains were painted black, and covered with green question marks, another hallmark of the Riddler. During the 2009 Southeastern United States floods, sections of the Mindbender were temporarily submerged under muddy water. The park was able to clean up and reopen the weekend following the floods. Design and operations Like many modern roller coasters, Mindbender operates on the block system featuring 5 blocks: station, transfer table, lift hill, reduction brake, and ready brake. These blocks are controlled by a program running on a programmable logic controller to ensure trains do not collide with one another. To assist in the movement of trains through the brakes, station, and transfer table, a series of feed motors can move a train at slow speeds from a full stop. Three trains were manufactured for the ride, although the ride control system is not equipped to handle all three on the track at once. One train was used as a spare, and occasionally only one is on the track during normal operation. In the 1990s, one train was dismantled to supply parts for the remaining two. Eventually, the park obtained trains from the former Schwarzkopf-designed Viper at Six Flags Astroworld. The trains have seven cars, each with four seats arranged in rows of two for a total of 28 riders per train. Passengers are restrained with a single ratcheting lap bar. The transfer table, located between the station and the lift hill, is used to move trains to and from the maintenance building. It features one brake to secure trains in place as the table rotates; it is not used during normal operation. There is also a feed motor located on the transfer table. The primary set of brakes that stops the trains' movement at the end of the ride are known as the reduction brakes. As a result of having no overhead protection from rain, wet conditions can cause unwanted slipping. The ride occasionally closes when these conditions become severe. There are two sets of trim brakes on the course of the ride that reduce the speed of the train. The attraction is placed on the side of a ridge, and portions of the track ‚Äì including the second vertical loop and a helix ‚Äì are located in an adjacent ravine, increasing the attraction's overall elevation change. The coaster used to be advertised as a \\"triple looper\\". The ride features two vertical loops with a diving helix which doesn't actually result in an inversion sometimes considered the third loop. Ride experience The ride begins with the train exiting the loading station, passing over the transfer track and climbing the lift hill. Once the train has reached the top of the lift, it turns right into a U-turn while traversing slightly downward. When the train nears the end of the U-turn, it travels sightly upwards nearing the height it was when it reached the top of the lift hill. The train then descends down the first drop and immediately enters the first loop. Upon exiting the loop, the train climbs a hill, levels out and reaches the first set of trim brakes. Next, the train turns left in a slight decline before leveling out. Once leveled, it enters the diving helix into the ravine. This is achieved by the left rail lowering much more steeply than the right rail as the train descends into a left-turning helix. The train begins to climb and level out after reaching the bottom of the ravine, producing significant positive G-forces. After exiting the top of the helix, the train enters a hill followed by a U-turn and a second set of trim brakes as the track levels out. The train then travels down another hill toward the ground and into the final loop. Upon exiting, the train passes through a tunnel and over a hill into another descending U-turn. The train ascends slightly as it completes the U-turn and enters the final brake run. 1984 accident On June 3, 1984, a mechanical problem caused a train to stop abruptly, sending four people to a hospital. The ride was repaired and put back into service with no more problems.

Enrollment is limited to between 30 and 50 students. The current enrollment is around twenty students split into two classes. There is a faculty of thirteen teachers, specialists, administrators, and assistants. In Feb. 2007 the school hosted the BC Waldorf Teachers Conference. The school has been operated since 1995 by the Steiner Educational Society, a group of parents and community members. It is certified by the Ministry of Education of British Columbia and receives government funding for Independent Schools. The school is a Developing Member of the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America. Typically, over half of the Grade 9 students entering the school come from a Waldorf elementary school. Sunrise Waldorf School,Welcome to the Sunrise Waldorf School at sunrisewaldorfschool.org a Kindergarten to Grade Eight school also located in the Cowichan Valley, provides many of the students, but is not formally associated with Island Oak High School. Every year since founding, a number of international students have come to the school in exchange for Island Oak High School students visiting their countries. Approximately 25% of the students are boarding or exchange students. They come from Waldorf Schools in France, Germany, England, Russia, Netherlands, Switzerland, Colombia, Peru, Chile and Australia. Most recently, exchange students have come from Germany, Switzerland, China, Japan and other Asian locations. International students stay for periods ranging from three months to several years. The opportunity to travel to other countries, to study and learn other languages and immerse themselves in other cultures is an attraction for BC and Canadian students of Grade Ten and Eleven. The high school offers many opportunities for students to grow and explore in their learning environment. Island oak typically sees two short-term exchanges per year with varying numbers of students, one at the beginning of the first semester and a second at the beginning of the second semester.

Before it was known as the Blind Brook School District, it was called District 5. The Interim Superintendent of Schools is Colin Byrne. The district serves about 70% of the area of Rye Brook; the remainder is in the Port Chester School District.Platzman, Cheryl. \\"IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN/RYE BROOK, N.Y.; 1 Close-Knit Village, 2 School Districts.\\" (Correction Appended) The New York Times.

An election is held each May to elect members to the BOE and to vote on the school district's budget. Demographics and instruction As of 2000 the district had 1,108 students and a 12 to 1 student to faculty ratio. Dr. James B. Van Hoven, the superintendent, said that district students are within \\"a high-powered academic program in a very intimate setting\\", and described the scenario as being \\"like a private school.\\".Platzman, Cheryl. \\"IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN/RYE BROOK, N.Y.; 1 Close-Knit Village, 2 School Districts.\\" (Correction Appended) The New York Times.

According to a US News Report from 2016, Blind Brook is ranked #32 in New York State and #177 Nationally. The AP participation rate as of 2016 is 81%. Schools The Blind Brook School District houses three schools in two buildings across the district (Middle and High School on same campus). =The Bruno M. Ponterio Ridge Street Elementary School= The Bruno M. Ponterio Ridge Street Elementary School serves kindergarten to 5th grade. The building was renamed in the late 1990s in honor of long-time building principal and Rye Brook resident, Bruno M. Ponterio. He was the principal for about 25 years. The current principal is Tracy Taylor. The associate principal is Lori Cutrone. The building was the first built by the Blind Brook School District, and was erected in the 1950s. Before the current building was built, a mansion standing on the property housed the school. The mansion was used as classrooms before and while the school building was built. Grades 1,2, 7 and 8 were in that building and 3, 4, 5 and 6 were in a brick building further up the road. It was part of a gift to the school district by the Lehman family. Lehman was a prominent legal figure in New York. The principal at that time was Myrtle Ansel. Teachers were Ms's Greavy, Kohler, Eton and Messrs Bonanno and Ralph. Mr Hager was the groundsman and lived with his family on the property. Before the creation of Blind Brook High School in 1973, the elementary school housed the entire Blind Brook School District. As time progressed, the building held grades K to 6th. When the middle school wing of the high school was built in 2002, the 6th grade was moved to the new building. That spring brought two graduations for the elementary school, as both the 5th and 6th grades moved on to the middle school. In 2006, ground was broken on a new administration wing, and air conditioners were installed throughout the building. The construction marked the first additions to the building since the addition of the New Gym and a two-level classroom wing in the 1960s. =Blind Brook Middle School= Blind Brook Middle School houses grades 6th through 8th and is on the King Street Campus. The principal is Patricia Lambert, after a few years in the High School she is back in the Middle School. The first principal was Dr. Thomas Wolf. Dr. Wolf was key in the creation of the current middle school curriculum during his tenure at Blind Brook, from mid-2002 to 2007. He announced in early 2006 that he would retire on January 31, 2007. A search for a new principal took place in 2006 and the Board of Education voted on a replacement prior to the end of the 2005‚Äì2006 school year. The replacement chosen was Karen Bronson, whose title, until Dr. Wolf retired, was \\"Principal on Special Assignment\\". She became the second principal of the middle school. Bronson retired at the end of the 2010‚Äì2011 school year. A search process resulted in the hiring of Patricia Lambert as her replacement. Lambert took over as the third middle school principal in July 2011. In 2013, Lambert moved on to become principal of the high school. Todd Richard, who was serving as the assistant principal for the middle school and the high school, was appointed as the new middle school principal. The middle school was originally composed of a hallway of classrooms and shared the entire building with the high school. As part of a district-wide bond referendum sparked by increasing enrollment, in 2002, a larger, two-story wing with a gymnasium, computer lab, and office space was built. This separated most daily activities of the middle school and high school, even though the two are still both under the same building. In 2006 ground was broken on a new middle school wing which houses general education classrooms, science labs, a cafeteria, lockers, and a new faculty office room. The middle school shares athletic facilities with the high school, along with the Monroe E. Haas Library and instructional media center, large group instruction, band room, auditorium, and cafeteria. State- of-the-art athletic fields were also constructed in 2006. =Blind Brook High School= Blind Brook High School was built in 1973 (renovated in 2002 and 2006) and houses grades 9 through 12. According to a 2014 article in Newsweek Global, the college enrollment rate was in the 95th percentile and the on time graduation rate was in the 89th percentile. Blind Brook High School was named a National Blue Ribbon School in September 2016.

It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on October 4, 2002. The address is 18730 West Newberry Road. The park encompasses approximately , and contains 21 historic buildings and 13 structures, including the family farmhouse with original furnishings, an 1880s kitchen outbuilding, a general store and post office, and a cane syrup complex. The farm also maintains a registered Cracker cattle herd, and at least one Florida Cracker horse. Park staff and volunteer living historians perform chores and other period activities while dressed in period clothes. The site is a working farm, showing agricultural development in Florida from the late 1850s through the mid-1940s. After that period, the farm was used solely for subsistence farming by a few third-generation family members. In 1996, Myrtle Dudley, the youngest member of the third generation, died, leaving the site to the Florida Park Service. Other features include a visitor center, a picnic area and nature trails. At least one open ranger-led tour is scheduled per month, not including the summer months. Tours for school classes and other large groups can be scheduled. A 19th century \\"Domestic Skills\\" group of volunteers meets every Wednesday morning, working on everything from pine needle baskets to quilts. Although, the farm is part of the Florida park system, \\"The Friends of Dudley Farm\\" (FoDF), a state-recognized volunteer Citizen Support Organization, holds numerous historical activities and festivals throughout the year in cooperation with state park personnel. Due to deterioration of the historic cane syrup complex, through continued use to produce cane syrup for sale at the farm, its use was suspended. However, FoDF built a similar cane syrup complex outside the homestead area, but still on park property. In addition to the cane syrup, the FoDF also produces authentic corn meal and corn grits for sale at the farm. All proceeds are used to support the park. Other supported community activities include weddings at the farm; tours of the homestead gardens by local and regional gardening groups; Boy and Girl Scout activities---such as living history, invasive weed control, etc.; Earth Day and National Public Lands Day. The schedule for many of these activities is available on the Friends of Dudley Farm Web site (see below).

Three other walled villages, Wing Lung Wai, Tai Hong Wai, and Kam Hing Wai are located nearby and were built around the same time.Introduction to 1444 Historic Buildings. Item #505 History Kat Hing Wai was established during the reign of the Ming Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464‚Äì1487). The walls enclosing Kat Hing Wai were built by Tang Chue-yin () and Tang Chik-kin () in the early years of the Kangxi reign (1661‚Äì1722) of the Qing dynasty. The Six-Day War (1899) was fought between the British Empire and the major punti clans of the New Territories in Hong Kong on 14‚Äì19 April 1899. The Tang Clan rebelled against British Colonial rule and defended themselves in Kat Hing Wai. After several unsuccessful attacks by British troops, the iron gates were blasted open and the gates were then shipped to London for exhibition. Following demands from the Tang Clan in 1924, the gate was eventually returned in 1925 by the 16th governor, as a celebration, Kat Hing Wai displays a tablet as an account of this incident by the entrance. Because of this, Kat Hing Wai became a very unique place where have a strong icon in both architectural and historical background to be studied.discoverhongkong.com (see this page for access details) Features Kat Hing Wai is a quasi-rectangular () walled village with seven meters high brick walls, originally used to protect from pirates and another clans' invasion. The village area is about eighty-meter square. As a family stronghold, Kat Hing Wai has served the Tangs well through the centuries, protecting the residents against bandits, rival clans, and wild tigers. During the Qing dynasty, a five-metre high blue brick wall and four cannon towers were added to defend against bandits. Today, the village is still completely surrounded by 18-inch-thick walls, outside which are the remains of a moat. However, most houses within the walls have been rebuilt in recent years. There is only one narrow entrance, with a pair of iron gates that were removed by the British in 1899 and only one was eventually returned in 1924. The current standing gates are a mismatched pair, the left hand side originally belongs to Tai Hong Wai and was given to Kat Hing Wai as a gift when the right gate was returned.

Galluzzi currently heads Piaggio's Advanced Design Center (PADC) in Pasadena, California, where he manages the design of the Aprilia, Moto Guzzi, Derbi and Gilera motorcycle brands, working closely with the company's styling headquarters (Piaggio Group Style Center) in Italy as well as its research and development centers in China, India and Vietnam. Widely known for having designed the Ducati Monster, Galluzzi has also designed the Aprilia Dorsoduro, RSV4, and Tuono -- as well as the Moto Guzzi V7 Racer and California 1400. Under Galluzzi's direction, Moto Guzzi received the Motorcycle Design Association Award in 2012, and in 2013, Visor Down named Galuzzi one of its Top Ten motorcycle designers. Background Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and raised in the USA, Galluzzi is a third generation motorcyclist. His interest in motorcycling began in the early 1960s when he received a motorcycle as a birthday gift from his uncle, a 1959 Kreidler 50cc. Galluzzi would later study at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, graduating in 1986 from the same Transportation Design program as BMW's noted designer, David Robb. Galluzzi first worked for Opel, and then for Honda's V-Car/Omega design studio in 1988, first in Offenbach, Germany and later in Milan. Design career In 1989 Galluzzi began designing for Cagiva, then Ducati's parent company, in Varese, Italy. Staying at Cagiva for 17 years, Galuzzi became Styling Director at Aprilia in July 2006, eventually become Vice President of Design for Piaggio, Aprilia's parent company. In 2012, Galluzzi relocated from Piaggio's headquarters in Pisa to Pasadena, California to lead the company's new Advanced Design Center (PADC), which manages other Piaggio centers in China, India, Italy and Vietnam -- and works with the main Piaggio Group Style Center, run by Director Marco Lambri. Galluzzi chose the Pasadena location, \\"because of its proximity to centers of transportation thought,\\" namely the Art Center College of Design, California Institute of Technology, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Galluzzi said he is, \\"looking for the next form of mobility,\\" five to fifteen years into the future, and he will be, \\"hiring young and creative and crazy people,\\" at the new design center to do, \\"experiments that might offer a rethinking or a melding of recent mobility concepts\\". Piaggio and Galluzzi hope to bring a more cosmopolitan perspective than is possible working only in Italy, and branch out to such areas as electric vehicles that combine aspects of a motorcycle and a car, like the Renault Twizy and Audi Urban Concept. The Daily Telegraphs Kevin Ash said, with the Piaggo Group's total US sales, including Aprilia and Vespa, at only 10,000 units in 2011, the new center must also be aimed to bolster sales in that market. Motorcycle designs At Cagiva and working for the Ducati brand, Galluzzi designed the 900 Supersport. The 1991 900 Supersport, offered in full- and half-fairing versions, became a classic, finding a balance between honoring the tradition set by the Super Sport models of the 1970s while looking modern and fresh. Because Galluzzi is tall, many of his best known creations -- which feature low seat heights and high foot pegs (e.g., the Monster) -- are better suited to their target buyer than their designer. =Monster= Under direction of Ducati's technical engineer, Massimo Bordi, Galluzzi created a design widely noted for its rigorous minimalism, -- drawing from his realization that \\"all you need (for a motorcycle) is a saddle, tank, engine, two wheels and handlebars\\". In ranking the Monster as 9th on his list of the 10 best motorcycle designs of all time, noted motorcycle designer, Glynn Kerr, described the design as having \\"all it needs and no more.\\" For its 1998 exhibition, The Art of the Motorcycle, the New York Guggenheim Museum featured 114 motorcycles, including the Monster. In the exhibition catalog, the museum said: \\"flying in the face of every contemporary motorcycle design rubric from Tokyo to Munich, Galluzzi recreated stripped-bare suburban specials in a production motorcycle. The result, a brilliant piece of pop-culture interpretation, was the M900, nicknamed \\"the Monster.\\" Numerous sources credit the Monster with popularizing the naked bike niche.\\" With Monsters sales eventually accounting for two-thirds or more of Ducati's output, the bike \\"became the company's best selling and most profitable model line,\\" essential to the company's success. =Later motorcycles= After the Monster, Galluzzi designed the 1997 Ducati ST2, which Industrial designer Andrew Serbinski considered ill-proportioned in its first generation, with its large fuel tank.\\" Galluzzi subsequently designed the Cagiva Planet of 1998, a variant of the Mito, followed by the 1999 Raptor and V-Raptor, which used a Suzuki engine shared by the TL1000. After leaving Cagiva and joining Aprilia in 2006, Galluzzi designed the 2007 Aprilia Dorsoduro, 2008 RSV4, 2008 Mana, SL 750 Shiver of 2009, and several Husqvarna models. He also contributed to the Vespa/Piaggio 1+1 concept vehicle. Many of the Ducatis Galluzzi originally styled were later revised and updated by Pierre Terblanche, including the ST series and the Monster 696 update of 2008. Terblanche later joined Galluzzi at Aprilia, where they have worked together on several new and revised models for Aprilia subsidiary Moto Guzzi. The two collaborated on the Moto Guzzi V12 series, with Le Mans, Strada, and X variants, displayed at EICMA in 2009. Galluzzi described the challenge he and Terblanche faced revising the Moto Guzzi image by saying, \\"The Guzzi crowd is extremely conservative, but if we only concentrate on those, we are going to lose eventually. So these bikes are looking into the future.\\" This is similar to the balance sought with earlier Ducati designs, but, \\"the advantage Guzzi has versus Ducati is that Ducati makes sportsbikes, Guzzi can do anything it wants because they've been doing it a long time and on all sorts of bikes.\\" In 2012 Moto Guzzi introduced Galuzzi's \\"Art Nouveau style\\" California 1400 which breaks with traditional Harley-Davidsion-inspired cruiser style of the previous California. The new 1400 is more radically modern, similar to the latest power cruisers, the Harley-Davidsion V-Rod and Ducati Diavel. The bike's new' engine expands Moto Guzzi's engine range, on top of the previous ' and ' displacement powerplants.

Her debut novel, written as Janet E. Morris, was High Couch of Silistra, the first in a quartet of character-driven novels with a female protagonist. According to original publisher Bantam Books, the Silistra quartet had over four million copies in print when the fourth volume, The Carnelian Throne was published. Charles N. Brown, co-founder and editor of Locus Magazine, is quoted on the Baen Books reissues of the series, noting that the stories featured \\"engrossing characters in a marvelous adventure.\\" Morris has contributed short fiction to the shared universe fantasy series Thieves' World, in which she created the Sacred Band of Stepsons, a mythical unit of ancient fighters modeled on the Sacred Band of Thebes. She created, orchestrated, and edited the Bangsian fantasy series Heroes in Hell, writing stories for the series as well as co-writing the related novel, The Little Helliad, with Chris Morris. Most of her fiction work has been in the fantasy and science fiction genres, although she has also written historical and other novels. Her 1983 book I, the Sun, a detailed biographical novel about the Hittite King Suppiluliuma I was praised for its historical accuracy; O. M.

Morris co-authored The Warriors Edge, which explores embracing unconventional psychological combat techniques, in 1990. Janet Morris and the USGSC's campaign for the creation of a non-lethality panel resulted in the assembly of the Non-Lethality Policy Review Group, led by Major General Chris S. Adams, USAF (ret.) in 1991. The group earned the political backing of Sam Nunn, chair of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services. Janet Morris published numerous white papers in 1991, detailing the USGSC‚Äôs non-lethal war doctrine proposals. The papers promoted diversifying and expanding non-lethal weapon capability for use in increased American intervention in global conflicts. The papers urged additional development of anti-personnel incapacitants as well as vehicular area denial devices. In 1991, Morris visited the Moscow Institute of Psycho- Correlations and observed the demonstration of the transmission of subliminal commands via infrasound. In 1995, Morris and her husband founded M2 Technologies. Since that time, their writing output has decreased in proportion to the increasing success of the company, which works with U.S. federal and military agencies on non-lethal weapon systems, novel technology applications, and software.

This can be through a connection between the amino and carboxyl ends of the peptide, for example in cyclosporin; a connection between the amino end and a side chain, for example in bacitracin; the carboxyl end and a side chain, for example in colistin; or two side chains or more complicated arrangements, for example in amanitin. Many cyclic peptides have been discovered in nature and many others have been synthesized in the laboratory. Their length ranges from just two amino acid residues to hundreds. In nature they are frequently antimicrobial or toxic; in medicine they have various applications, for example as antibiotics and immunosuppressive agents. Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) is a convenient method to detect cyclic peptides in crude extract from bio-mass. Classification Cyclic peptides can be classified according to the types of bonds that comprise the ring. *Homodetic cyclic peptides, such as cyclosporine A, are those in which the ring is composed exclusively of normal peptide bonds (i.e. between the alpha carboxyl of one residue to the alpha amine of another). The smallest such species are 2,5-diketopiperazines, being derived from the cyclisation of a dipeptide. *Cyclic isopeptides contain at least one non-alpha amide linkage, such as a linkage between the side chain of one residue to the alpha carboxyl group of another residue, as in microcystin and bacitracin. *Cyclic depsipeptides, such as aureobasidin A and HUN-7293, have at least one lactone (ester) linkage in place of one of the amides. Some cyclic depsipeptides are cyclized between the C-terminal carboxyl and the side chain of a Thr or Ser residue in the chain, such as kahalalide F, theonellapeptolide, and didemnin B. * Bicyclics such as the amanitins and the phalloidins contain a bridging group, generally between two of the side chains. In the amatoxins, this is formed as a sulfoxide bridge between the Trp and Cys residues. Other bicyclic peptides include echinomycin, triostin A, and Celogentin C. * There are a number of bi and monocyclic peptides which are cyclized through a disulfide bond between two cysteines, oxytocin being a notable example. Biosynthesis Cyclic peptides in plants are synthesized via a two-step process; the translation of a linear peptide chain, and its subsequent formation into a cyclic structure through activities of a protease- like enzyme or other ways. Properties and applications Cyclic peptides tend to be extremely resistant to the process of digestion, making them of interest to scientist working on novel oral medications.

The taxonomic relationships of this species have been subject to debate; it has historically been grouped with either the Psittaculini parrots or the vasa parrots, with the latest genetic study favouring the former group. The Mascarene parrot was in length with a large red bill and long, rounded tail feathers. Its legs were red, and it had naked red skin around the eyes and nostrils. It had a black facial mask and partially white tail feathers, but the colouration of the body, wings and head in the living bird is unclear. Descriptions from life indicate the body and head were ash grey, and the white part of the tail had two dark central feathers. In contrast, stuffed specimens and old descriptions based on them indicate that the body was brown and the head bluish. This may be due to the specimens having changed colour as a result of ageing and exposure to light. Very little is known about the bird in life. The Mascarene parrot was first mentioned in 1674, and live specimens were later brought to Europe, where they lived in captivity. The species was scientifically described in 1771. Only two stuffed specimens exist today, in Paris and Vienna. The date and cause of extinction for the Mascarene parrot is unclear. The latest account, from 1834, is considered dubious, so it is probable that the species became extinct prior to 1800, and may have become extinct even earlier. Taxonomy 1801 illustration by Jacques Barraband The Mascarene parrot was first mentioned by the French traveller Sieur Dubois in his 1674 travelogue and only described a few times from life afterwards. At least three live specimens were brought to France in the late 18th century and kept in captivity, two of which were described while alive. Today, two stuffed specimens exist; the holotype, specimen MNHN 211, which is in the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, while the other, specimen NMW 50.688, is in the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna. The latter specimen was bought from the Leverian Museum during a sale in London in 1806. A third stuffed specimen existed around the turn of the 18th century. The Mascarene parrot was scientifically described as Psittacus mascarinus (abbreviated as \\"mascarin\\") by the Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in 1771. This name was first used by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 but was not intended as a scientific name. The name is a reference to the Mascarene Islands, which were themselves named after their Portuguese discoverer, Pedro Mascarenhas. Early writers claimed the Mascarene parrot was found on Madagascar, an idea that led the French naturalist Ren√© Primev√®re Lesson to coin the junior synonym Mascarinus madagascariensis in 1831. His new genus name prevailed and, when the Italian zoologist Tommaso Salvadori combined it with the earlier specific name in 1891, it became a tautonym (a scientific name in which the two parts are identical). Lesson also included species of the Tanygnathus and Psittacula genera in Mascarinus, but this was not accepted by other writers. The following year, the German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler erected the genus Coracopsis for the Mascarene parrot (which became Coracopsis mascarina under this system) and the lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). The English zoologist William Alexander Forbes, believing that mascarinus was invalid as a specific name, since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name Mascarinus duboisi in 1879, in honour of Dubois. The binomial name was emended from M. mascarinus to M. mascarin by the IOC World Bird List in 2016, to conform with how other species epithets by Linnaeus have been treated. An unidentified dark parrot seen alive by the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa was given the name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed it was from the Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been a grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead. Another unidentified parrot specimen, this one brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, was described by the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out similarities and differences between the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that this might have been a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers. Subfossil parrot remains were later excavated from grottos on R√©union and reported in 1996. X-rays of the two existing stuffed Mascarene parrots made it possible to compare the remaining bones with the subfossils and showed these were intermediate in measurements in comparison to the modern specimens. The lesser vasa parrot was introduced to R√©union as early as 1780 but, though the subfossil parrot bones were similar to that species in some aspects, they were more similar to those of the Mascarene parrot and considered to belong to it. =Evolution= Skull elements extracted from the Paris specimen, 1866 The affinities of the Mascarene parrot are unclear, and two hypotheses have competed since the mid-19th century. Some authors grouped it with the Coracopsinae (of African origin) due to its dark plumage, and others with the Psittaculinae parrots (of Asian origin) based on the large red beak, a feature which is diagnostic for that group. Its plumage pattern was mostly atypical for a psittaculine, though other members have black facial patterns. Although little is known about most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes, subfossil remains show that they shared common features, such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Hume supported their common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe based on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise the Mascarene Islands from other areas.Check & Hume. (2008). pp. 69‚Äì71. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. R√©union is 3 million years old, which is enough time for new genera to evolve, but many endemics would have been wiped out by the eruption of the volcano Piton des Neiges between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent and extant species would therefore probably be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event. If the Mascarene parrot had in fact evolved into a distinct genus on R√©union prior to the volcanic eruption, it would have been one of the few survivors of this extinction event. A 2011 genetic study by Samit Kundu and colleagues (which sampled the Paris specimen) found that the Mascarene parrot was grouped among the subspecies of the lesser vasa parrot from Madagascar and nearby islands and therefore not related to the Psittacula parrots. It also found that the Mascarene parrot line diverged 4.6 to 9 million years ago, prior to the formation of R√©union, indicating this must have happened elsewhere. The cladogram accompanying the 2011 study is shown below: Plate from Comte de Buffon's encyclopaedia Histoire Naturelle, 1700s In 2012, Leo Joseph and colleagues acknowledged the finding but pointed out that the sample might have been damaged and that further testing was needed before the issue could be fully resolved. They also noted that if Mascarinus was confirmed to be embedded within the genus Coracopsis, the latter would become a junior synonym, since the former name is older. In 2012, Hume expressed surprise at these findings due to the anatomical similarities between the Mascarene parrot and other parrots from the Mascarene islands that are believed to be psittaculines. He also pointed out that there is no fossil evidence found on other islands to support the hypothesis that the species evolved elsewhere before reaching R√©union. In 2017, Lars Podsiadlowski and colleagues sampled the Vienna specimen for a new genetic study and found that the Mascarene parrot was indeed part of the Psittacula group as suggested by Hume, clustering with the extinct Seychelles parakeet (P. wardi) and Asian subspecies of the Alexandrine parakeet (P. eupatria). The Mascarene parrot was therefore interpreted as having descended from an ancestral lineage of Alexandrine parakeets that had dispersed from Asia towards the Mascarene islands across the Indian Ocean. The researchers suggested that the 2011 genetic study had probably used a composite of sequences from two other parrot species sampled for the study (including a lesser vasa parrot), a result of contamination during laboratory procedures. The 2017 study also found that the parrots of the genus Tanygnathus were grouped among Psittacula parrots, and proposed thatTanygnathus and Mascarinus should therefore be merged into the genus Psittacula. The cladogram accompanying the 2017 study is shown below: Description Plate by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet, 1779, showing a bluish head and brown body The Mascarene parrot was in length. The wing was , the tail , the culmen , and the tarsus . It had a large red bill and moderately long, rounded tail feathers. It had a black velvet-like facial mask on the front part of the head. There are several discrepancies in how the colour of the body, wings, tail feathers and the head have historically been described and depicted. In 1674, Dubois described live specimens as being \\"petit-gris\\" which is the colour of the dark phase of the red squirrel. According to Hume, this colour is a dark blackish grey or brown. In 1760, Brisson published the following description based on a captive bird (which may have been the specimen now preserved in Paris): Instead of grey, several later authors described the body as brown and the head as bluish lilac, based on stuffed specimens, and this has become the \\"orthodox image\\" of the bird. Live birds were never described with these colours. Hume proposed that this colouration is an artifact of the taxidermy specimens having aged and being exposed to light, which can turn grey and black to brown. Such a transformation has also turned an aberrant dickcissel (Spiza americana) specimen (sometimes considered a distinct species, \\"Townsend's dickcissel\\"), from grey to brown. The two extant Mascarene parrot specimens also differ from each other in colouration. The Paris specimen has a greyish-blue head and a brown body, paler on the underparts. Its tail and wing feathers were severely damaged by sulphuric acid in an attempt at fumigation in the 1790s. The Vienna specimen is a pale brown on the head and body overall, with an irregular distribution of white feathers on the tail, back, and wings. In 2017 the Australian ornithologist Joseph M. Forshaw found it hard to accept that all the illustrations that showed the colour as brown were wrong; he found it more likely that the brown would have merely faded in intensity rather than from grey to brown. He stated that by the time the earliest known illustrations of the bird were made, it is unlikely they would already have faded to brown because of exposure to light. He also doubted that poor diet of caged birds would have consistently turned them brown, and instead accepted the \\"orthodox image\\" of the bird as brown. Illustration of the Paris specimen's head (after its skull was removed) and feet, 1879 Confusion over the colouration of the Mascarene parrot has also been furthered by a plate by French engraver Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in Buffon's 1779 Histoire Naturelle Des Oiseaux, the first coloured illustration of this species. It shows the bird as brown with a purplish head, and the strength of these colours differs considerably between copies, a result of having been hand-coloured by many different artists who worked under Martinet in his workshop. Across these copies, the body ranges from chestnut brown to greyish chocolate, the tail from light grey to blackish grey-brown, and the head from bluish grey to dove-grey. The plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases, a feature described by Brisson, and these features have been repeated by subsequent artists. Martinet's illustration and Buffon's description were perhaps based on the Paris specimen. In 1879, Forbes stated the cere was covered by feathers which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne- Edwards prior to 1866. This may have led to the distortion of the shape of the head and nostrils as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article. Behaviour and ecology 1907 depiction by Keulemans, based on his 1893 illustration Very little is known about the Mascarene parrot in life. Since several specimens were kept alive in captivity, it was probably not a specialised feeder.Check & Hume. (2008). p. 42. That the Vienna specimen was partially white may have been the result of food deficiency during a long period in captivity; the clipped primary wing feathers indicate it was caged. Little was known about parrot-diet in the 1700s, and the Vienna specimen may not have received enough of the amino acid tyrosine through its food, which it would have needed for melanin synthesis. In other parrots, this would have resulted in orange instead of white colour in the affected feathers, due to the presence of the pigment psittacin, but Coracopsis parrots and the Mascarene parrot are the only parrots that lack this pigment. The specimen has also been described as \\"partially albinistic\\" at times, though true albinism (lack of the enzyme tyrosinase) can by definition never only be partial. Forested mountain area on R√©union, 2006 In 1705, the French cartographer Jean Feuilley gave a description of the parrots of R√©union and their ecology which indicates that they fattened themselves seasonally: The Mascarene parrot may have once inhabited Mauritius as well based on a 17th-century account by the English traveller Peter Mundy which mentioned \\"russet parrots\\". This is a possibility, since R√©union and Mauritius do share some types of animals, but no fossil evidence has yet been discovered. Many other endemic species of R√©union became extinct after the arrival of man and the resulting disruption of the island's ecosystem. The Mascarene parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the hoopoe starling, the R√©union ibis, the R√©union parakeet, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the R√©union swamphen, the R√©union owl, the R√©union night heron, and the R√©union pink pigeon. Extinct R√©union reptiles include the R√©union giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on R√©union and Mauritius but vanished from both islands.Check & Hume. (2008). pp. 30‚Äì43. Extinction Carl Wilhelm Hahn's 1834 illustration of the supposedly last living bird, which may have been based on Martinet's 1779 image Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula echo) of Mauritius has survived. The others probably all became extinct due to a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation. The cause and date of extinction for the Mascarene parrot itself is uncertain. In 1834, the German zoologist Carl Wilhelm Hahn published an often-cited account of a live Mascarene parrot in the possession of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The bird must have been very old at the time, and Hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen. The IUCN Red List accepts the 1834 account as the last mention of a live specimen. The veracity of Hahn's claim was questioned as early as 1876, and the illustration appears to be plagiarised from the plate by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet which was published at least 50 years earlier. After King Maximilian died in 1825, his collection was auctioned off, but no Mascarene parrot was mentioned in the inventory of species. Hahn did not mention the date in which he actually saw the bird which could have been long before 1834. The fact that Martinet's image was copied and that no mounted specimen exists (though such a rare bird would probably have been preserved) makes Hahn's account dubious. He may instead have based his account on other sources or even hearsay. If Hahn's account is disregarded, the Mascarene parrot probably became extinct prior to 1800. The last account of wild specimens on R√©union is from the 1770s. It is thought that the Mascarene parrot went extinct in the wild while captive specimens still survived in Europe, since specimens are known to have lived there after the last mention of wild birds. In the 1790s, French naturalist Fran√ßois Levaillant stated that the bird was rare and that he had seen three of them in France. One of the last definite accounts of live specimens is the following 1784 description by Mauduyt based on captive birds: Contrary to Feuilley's claims, Dubois mentioned that the Mascarene parrot was not edible which may have led to R√©union visitors mostly ignoring it.Check & Hume. (2008). p. 107. It was the last of the indigenous parrots of R√©union to become extinct. The only endemic bird species on R√©union that disappeared after the Mascarene parrot was the hoopoe starling in the mid-19th century.

It is the only genus in the family Phreatogammaridae, and contains four species, three of which were described by Charles Chilton. Phreatogammarus fragilis P. fragilis was the first species to be described, when Charles Chilton named it Gammarus fragilis in 1882; it was moved to the genus Phreatogammarus by T. R. R. Stebbing in 1899, becoming the type species for the group. It lives in wells and groundwater, mainly in Canterbury and Nelson, and is not known to occur on the North Island. Phreatogammarus propinquus Chilton's second species, P. propinquus was described in 1907 from a single specimen collected near the summit of Mount Anglem on Stewart Island/Rakiura. Chilton originally thought this specimen was a male, but later realised that it was in fact female. Other specimens have been collected near sea level, but have not been described in the literature. Phreatogammarus helmsii When he realised that he had mis-sexed his Mount Anglem specimen of P. propinquus, Chilton also realised that the material he had described under that name from Rona Bay, Wellington, was a third species, which he named P. helmsii in 1918. It is a coastal freshwater species, only occurring further inland near Hamilton on the Waikato River system. It is widespread, occurring in many parts of both the North and South Islands. Phreatogammarus waipoua Few scientists have worked on the genus Phreatogammarus after Charles Chilton, and it was not until 2003 that a fourth species was described. M. A. Chapman, in a revision of the genus, established a new species, P. waipoua for populations of Phreatogammarus living in two forests in Northland Region. Undescribed species There are at least two further undescribed species which live in Canterbury, and many collections from Nelson have not yet been examined.

He also won six caps for England. Morley is now a regular on the 'Villa Old Stars' circuit. He also provides colour commentary for radio broadcasts on Aston Villa's website. Club career Tony Morley after winning the 1982 European Cup on 26 May Morley was born in Ormskirk, and represented Ormskirk and District Schools. He signed as an apprentice with Preston North End in July 1969, before turning professional in August 1972. In February 1976 he moved across Lancashire to join Burnley for a ¬£100,000 fee. He joined Aston Villa for ¬£200,000 in June 1979. A skilful, nippy winger, Morley enjoyed the best days of his career at Villa Park. He was seen as a wayward genius but was moulded by manager Ron Saunders into one of the most dangerous players around. He was famed for scoring spectacular goals, in particular, one against Everton at Goodison Park where he ran at the defence before striking right footed from outside the penalty area into the top left corner of the net. This goal won him the 'Goal of the Season' award for 1980‚Äì81. He was a vital part of the Villa side that won the League Championship in 1980‚Äì81 and the European Cup the year after. His brilliant dribble and cross set up Peter Withe for the winning goal against Bayern Munich in the final. His full Villa record was 170(+10 as sub) appearances, 34 goals. After adding a European Super Cup Winners' medal to his collection, he was transferred from Villa to local rivals West Bromwich Albion. He spent two seasons there, including briefly going on loan to another Midlands club, Birmingham City. He had a slightly nomadic career from then on, joining Seiko, Den Haag (with whom he won a runners-up medal in the Dutch Cup, scoring in the final), a return to West Brom, a brief spell on loan to Burnley, Tampa Bay Rowdies, before finishing his career at Hamrun Spartans. International career Morley won six caps for England, but his career fell into decline after not being picked for any of their games at the 1982 World Cup. This despite the fact that England boss Ron Greenwood supposedly favoured attacking football. He failed to score in any of his six senior appearances for England, his first cap occurring on 18 November 1981 in England's 1‚Äì0 World Cup qualification clincher against Hungary, the last coming almost exactly a year later when he took to the field in a Euro 84 qualifier against Greece which England won 3‚Äì0. Morley was not selected for the England squad for the 1982 World Cup in Spain, with Greenwood opting for Arsenal's Graham Rix instead.

The teams were: *(1) Atlanta Braves (Eastern Division champion, 106‚Äì56) vs. (4) Chicago Cubs (Wild Card, 90‚Äì73): Braves win series, 3‚Äì0. *(2) Houston Astros (Central Division champion, 102‚Äì60) vs. (3) San Diego Padres (Western Division champion, 98‚Äì64): Padres win series, 3‚Äì1.The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage, which for the first time was determined by playing record. Also for the first time, the team with home field advantage played the first two games at home, with potentially Game 5 at home as well; previously, the team with the home field \\"advantage\\" had played the first two games on the road, with the possibility of the final three games at home. The Cubs had won the wild card spot through a one-game playoff with the San Francisco Giants, winning 5‚Äì3 on September 28. The Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres went on to meet in the NL Championship Series (NLCS). The Padres defeated the Braves four games to two to become the National League champion, and lost to the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1998 World Series. Matchups =Atlanta Braves vs. Chicago Cubs= =Houston Astros vs. San Diego Padres= Atlanta vs. Chicago =Game 1= Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia The Braves faced the Chicago Cubs, who made it into the playoffs by beating the San Francisco Giants in a tiebreaker for the Wild Card spot and though the Cubs won the season series 6-3 including a three game sweep in Wrigley Field without NL MVP Sammy Sosa, and a two game sweep in Turner Field, the Braves proved that the post season would be different. John Smoltz pitched masterfully and Michael Tucker started the scoring with a two-run home run off Chicago starter Mark Clark. Then an Andruw Jones sacrifice fly with two on made it 3‚Äì0. In the bottom of the seventh, Ryan Klesko put the game away with a grand slam into right field off of Matt Karchner after three walks off of Clark (one) and Felix Heredia (two walks). Clark allowed four runs, but two were unearned. The Cubs would score in the eighth off Smoltz on Tyler Houston's lead off home run. This ended Smoltz's night, but John Rocker and Kerry Ligtenberg slammed the door on Game 1. =Game 2= Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia Game 2 was a pitchers' duel. Kevin Tapani faced Tom Glavine; the two had previously faced each other in the 1991 World Series. Lance Johnson drove in the lone Chicago run in the top of the sixth on a groundout. However, leaving Tapani in to pitch the ninth ultimately cost the Cubs the game. Javy L√≥pez hit the game-tying home run and Chipper Jones drove in the winning run in the tenth off Terry Mulholland with an RBI single. =Game 3= Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois Game 3 was another pitchers' duel. Greg Maddux faced Rookie of the Year Kerry Wood, hoping to keep the ship afloat for the Cubs. The Braves scored first in the top of the third when Maddux doubled and later scored on a passed ball with two outs. Wood pitched five innings and that was the only run he would allow. Maddux was masterful, carrying a shutout into the bottom of the eighth. In the top of the eighth, Gerald Williams drove in another run with an RBI single off Rod Beck after Terry Mulholland allowed a single and walk. When Andruw Jones was intentionally walked to load the bases, Eddie P√©rez belted a grand slam into left field to put the game and the series away. Maddux was lifted after giving up three straight singles in favor in Ligtenberg. Mickey Morandini's sacrifice fly and Mark Graces RBI single made it 6‚Äì2 Braves, but Ligtenberg retired the Cubs in order in the ninth. Jos√© Hern√°ndez flied to center for the final out of the series as the Braves won their first game at Wrigley Field of the season. =Composite box= 1998 NLDS (3‚Äì0): Atlanta Braves over Chicago Cubs Houston vs. San Diego =Game 1= Astrodome in Houston, Texas The Astros entered the playoffs with the league's best offense and red-hot pitcher Randy Johnson, who had gone 10‚Äì1 since being traded to the Astros in a mid-season deadline deal, well rested for Game 1. However, Padres ace Kevin Brown was more than up for the challenge as he set an LDS record striking out 16 Astros in eight innings before turning the game over to all-star closer Trevor Hoffman for the save. The Padres only managed two runs, including a home run by slugger Greg Vaughn. Despite Brown's dominant performance, the game was not without its tense moments thanks to a less than perfect ninth inning. Hoffman, who had tied the NL record for saves with 53, did allow an unearned run on two hits thanks to a throwing error by third baseman Ken Caminiti. The error by the former Astro brought Houston to within one run before Hoffman slammed the door ending the game at 2‚Äì1. This was the first road postseason victory for the Padres. =Game 2= Astrodome in Houston, Texas Shane Reynolds pitched a strong seven innings for Houston yielding only two runs and the Astros' offense showed some of its regular season league-leading form by tagging Padres' starter Andy Ashby for three runs and chasing him out of the game after only four innings. Leading 3‚Äì2 and looking to give closer Billy Wagner a little more room to work with, the Astros scored again off former Astro Donnie Wall in the bottom of the eighth inning sending Wagner to the hill with 4‚Äì2 lead. Armed with a 100 mph fastball, Wagner was 30 for 35 in save opportunities and now had a complement to his fastball in the form of a newly learned slider courtesy of teammate Randy Johnson. Nonetheless, Wagner surrendered a single to 1996 MVP Ken Caminiti, and then a pinch-hit game-tying home run to Jim Leyritz, who had done the same thing as a member of the New York Yankees to Mark Wohlers of the Braves in the 1996 World Series. Unfazed, the Astros led off the bottom of the inning with an infield single by Ricky Gutierrez off Dan Miceli. The Padres countered by bringing in closer Trevor Hoffman. After a sacrifice by catcher Brad Ausmus moved him to second base, Gutierrez stole third uncontested setting up pinch-hitter Bill Spiers to be the game's hero. Spiers delivered with a single off Hoffman and the Astros had their first postseason victory since 1986. =Game 3= Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California With their Game 1 victory, the Padres had taken home-field advantage away from the favored Astros and San Diego manager Bruce Bochy was determined not to let the momentum turn in Houston's favor after Game 2, so he decided to gamble and started Game 1 starter Kevin Brown on short rest instead of lefty Sterling Hitchcock. The explosive Astros offense, being predominantly right-handed, was especially brutal on left-handed pitchers and a Game 3 win by Houston would have left the Padres facing elimination in Game 4 against Randy Johnson. Brown was opposed by fellow sinkerballer Mike Hampton of the Astros who proved to be Brown's equal. Not nearly the same unhittable master of Game 1, Brown's control was shaky from the beginning as he walked five Astros in seven innings. Still, the Astros were never able to deliver the knock-out blow and managed only one run against Brown, but were still tied going into the bottom of the seventh thanks to a solid six innings of one-run two-hit ball by Mike Hampton. In the bottom of the seventh, Jim Leyritz added yet another chapter to his resume of clutch October heroics with a go-ahead home run off Astros reliever Scott Elarton that gave the Padres a 2‚Äì1 lead. Neither team scored again and Trevor Hoffman struck out the side in the top of the ninth for the save. =Game 4= Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California The only game of the series that wasn't decided by one run began with veteran former Cy Young Award winner Randy Johnson squaring off against 27-year-old Sterling Hitchcock who was making his first postseason start. It was Hitchcock, however, that proved dominant by striking out 11 Astros in only six innings of work while Leyritz hit his third home run in as many games to help the Padres to a 2‚Äì1 lead. With the Astros' highly touted offense rendered almost completely silent, the bullpen finally collapsed in the eighth inning as Houston pitchers surrendered four runs to the Padres leading to a 6‚Äì1 series-clinching victory for San Diego. =Composite box= 1998 NLDS (3‚Äì1): San Diego Padres over Houston Astros Series quotes Notes External links *ATL vs. CHC at Baseball-Reference *SDP vs. HOU at Baseball-Reference Category:National League Division Series National League Division Series Category:San Diego Padres postseason Category:Atlanta Braves postseason Category:Houston Astros postseason Category:Chicago Cubs postseason National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series Category:1990s in Chicago Category:1998 in Illinois National League Division Series Category:1990s in San Diego National League Division Series ","title":"1998 National League Division Series"},{"id":"5682252","text":"Gonzalo de los Santos da Rosa (born 19 July 1976) is a Uruguayan retired footballer who played as a defensive midfielder, and is a manager.

The word is cognate to Avestan aspa, Latin equus, Greek (hippos), Germanic *ehwaz and Baltic *a≈°vƒÅ all from Proto-Indo-European *h‚ÇÅ√©·∏±wos. Vedic period There are repeated references to the horse the Vedas (c. 1500 - 500 BC). In particular the Rigveda has many equestrian scenes, often associated with chariots. The Ashvins are divine twins named for their horsemanship. The earliest undisputed finds of horse remains in South Asia are from the Swat culture (c. 1500 - 500 BC). Puranic legend Uchchaihshravas The legend states that the first horse emerged from the depth of the ocean during the churning of the oceans. It was a horse with white color and had two wings. It was known by the name of Uchchaihshravas. The legend continues that Indra, king of the devas, took away the mythical horse to his celestial abode, the svarga (heaven). Subsequently, Indra severed the wings of the horse and presented the same to the mankind. The wings were severed to ensure that the horse would remain on the earth (prithvi) and not fly back to Indra's svarga.  Archaeology  = Paleolithic = Remains of the Equus namadicus have been found from Pleistocene levels in India.Kennedy 2000 The Equus namadicus is closely related to the Equus sivalensis.Arun Sonakia and S. Biswas, Antiquity of the Narmada Homo erectus, the early man of India, 1998, Palaeontology Division, Geological Survey of India ; Biswas, S., Rec. GSI, 1988, 118, 53‚Äì62. The Equus sivalensis lived in the Himalayan foothills in prehistoric times and it is assumed it was extinct during the last Ice Age. = Bronze Age = Remains of horses have been claimed to have been found in deposits at Mahagara near Allahabad (dated to around 2265 BC to 1480 BC, described as Equus ferus caballus Linn), Hallur in Karnataka (c.1500 - 1300 BC, described as Equus ferus caballus), Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa (\\"small horse\\"), LothalBryant 2001; S.R. Rao (1985) Lothal - A Harappan Port Town (e.g., a terracotta figurine and a molar horse tooth, dated to 2200 BC), Kalibangan, and Kuntasi (dated to 2300‚Äì1900 BC). Horse remains from the Harappan site Surkotada (dated to 2400-1700 BC) have been identified by A.K. Sharma as Equus ferus caballus. The horse specialist Sandor B√∂k√∂nyi (1997) later confirmed these conclusions and stated the excavated tooth specimens could \\"in all probability be considered remnants of true horses [i.e. Equus ferus caballus]\\". B√∂k√∂nyi stated that \\"The occurrence of true horse (Equus caballus L.) was evidenced by the enamel pattern of the upper and lower cheek and teeth and by the size and form of incisors and phalanges (toe bones).\\".(quoted by Prof. B.B. Lal from B√∂k√∂nyi's letter to the Director of the Archaeological Survey of India, 13-12-1993, in New Light on the Indus Civilization, Aryan Books, Delhi 1998, p.111) However, archaeologists like Meadow (1997) disagree, on the grounds that the remains of the Equus ferus caballus horse are difficult to distinguish from other equid species such as Equus asinus (donkeys) or Equus hemionus (onagers).(see Edwin Bryant. 2001:169-175) An alleged clay model of a horse has been found in Mohenjo-Daro and an alleged horse figurine in Periano Ghundai in the Indus Valley.Bryant 2001:171, with reference to Mackay 1938 and Piggott 1952 Trautmann (1982) thus remarked the supply and import of horses has \\"always\\" been a preoccupation of the Indians and \\"it is a structure of its history, then, that India has always been dependent upon western and central Asia for horses.\\"(Bryant 2001) The paucity of horse remains could also be explained by India's climatic factors which lead to decay of horse bones. Horse bones may also be rare because horses were probably not eaten or used in burials by the Harappans.Bryant 2001:194; S.P. Gupta. The dawn of civilization, in G.C.

Thapar 1996:21. The theory of Aryan race and India. Social Scientist, Delhi. The horse only appears in Mesopotamia from around 1800 BC as a ridden animal and acquires military significance with the invention of the chariot. Domestication of the horse before the second millennium appears to be confined to its native habitat (the Great Steppe). Colin Renfrew (1999) also remarked, \\"the significance of the horse ... has been much exaggerated\\",Bryant 2001:120 and Bryant holds, \\"using such negative evidence, by the same logic used to eliminate India as a candidate, ultimately any potential homeland can be disqualified due to lacking some fundamental Proto-Indo-European item or another\\".(Bryant 2001: 120) Renfrew's statement refers to his own Anatolian hypothesis, which is criticized by mainstream scholarship on similar grounds. In RV 1.162.18, the sacrificial horse is described as having 34 (2x17) ribs: :The four-and-thirty ribs of the Swift Charger, kin to the Gods, the slayer's hatchet pierces. :Cut ye with skill, so that the parts be flawless, and piece by piece declaring them dissect them. (trans. Griffith) Frawley (2005) speculatesFrawley: Myth of Aryan Invasion, 2005 that the Rigvedic horse could therefore be the Indian Equus sivalensis (which may or may not have had 34 ribs; modern horses usually have 36, with occasional specimens of 34 or 38).

Publication history Devilance first appeared in Forever People #11 (August 1972) and was created by Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Devilance the Pursuer was once one of the most respected minions of Darkseid, lord of Apokolips, as the hunter who captured and brought back his prey to his master for many years. Devilance was tapped to track and destroy Darkseid's hated rivals, the Forever People. When he found them on an island in the Pacific Ocean, the Forever People switched places with the Infinity Man. Devilance and Infinity Man engaged in a terrible battle that destroyed the small island they were fighting on. Both of them appeared atomized and were presumed dead, although later Infinity Man returned to assist the Forever People again. Devilance was not seen for years. Devilance appears in DC's weekly comic series 52, where he is substantially larger than he was portrayed in the past. He is on a remote alien planet where Starfire, Adam Strange and Animal Man are stranded.52 Week 7 (June 21, 2006). DC Comics. It is revealed that Devilance has captured Starfire. Adam Strange and Animal Man search for her but fall victim to his traps and are also captured.52 Week 8 (June 28, 2006). DC Comics. Three days and two nights by in-story time, Devilance seems to believe the trio saw something only the gods (such as himself) were meant to. Thus, being \\"The God of the Pursuit\\", Devilance took it upon himself to catch them. The team manage to burn Devilance's face and escape his clutches. They also steal his lance in hopes of using it as a power source for their space cruiser. Devilance is last seen bound by the very vines that once held his captives. It is also of note that, as Starfire stated during her escape, the whole planet they are on seems to be a trap set by Devilance himself.52 Week 9 (July 6, 2006). DC Comics. He catches up with their spaceship only to be killed by Lobo.52 Week 17 (August 30, 2006). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Devilance the Pursuer has superhuman strength and a high degree of immunity to physical injury. Possibly much of his strength and resistance to injury is due to his ability to increase his own physical density. Devilance also has many undefined powers that enable his body to adjust to and undo the effects of various kinds of weaponry or super powers used against him. For example, his body can adjust to extreme temperatures. =Equipment= Devilance's principal weapon is his lance, which serves many functions. It can fire powerful energy blasts. It enables Devilance to fly by holding onto it. It contains circuitry enabling him to track down his victims. Other circuitry causes his lance to return to him if he is separated from it. Devilance can cause his lance's blade to glow with destructive energy. He can also mentally command the lance to leap onto an adversary and tightly coil itself about him.

William Joseph Levada was the most recent Cardinal Deacon of the Titulus S. Mariae in Domnica. Name Fontana della Navicella The appellation \\"in Domnica\\" has been differently explained. One interpretation is the derivation from \\"dominicum\\" (\\"of the Lord\\"), and by extension \\"church\\".Armellini. Another interpretation is that it refers to the name of Cyriaca, a Christian woman who resided nearby and whose name denotes \\"belonging to the Lord\\": \\"Dominica\\" in Latin.Thayer A third interpretation is that the name derives from the Latin phrase in dominica (praedia) (\\"on Imperial property\\").Tyler Lansford , The Latin Inscriptions of Rome: A Walking Guide (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011). One other possible explanation is that it is almost the only one from the lesser Churches in Rome that serves as station Church on a Sunday, namely the second Sunday of Lent (dominica means \\"Sunday\\" in Latin; the other such Church is San Pancrazio which serves as station for Low Sunday), so given the huge number of Churches dedicated to the Blessed Virgin this might have been chosen as identifier. - The appellation \\"alla Navicella\\" denotes \\"near the little ship\\", and refers to the sculpture of a Roman ship that has been in this location since ancient times, possibly as a votive offering to an ancient temple, and which Pope Leo X turned into a fountain (Fontana della Navicella) in front of the church. History The basilica was built in ancient times, close to the barracks of the Fifth Cohort of the Roman Vigiles on the Caelian Hill. The basilica is mentioned in the records of a synod of Pope Symmachus in AD 499. In 678, it was one of seven churches assigned to deacons by Pope Agatho. The basilica was rebuilt from 818-22 by Pope Paschal I, and included mosaic decoration. Pope Paschal I is credited with Rome's early 9th century age of renovation and artistic splendor. The Medici family extensively modified the interior in the 16th century, because some of them were the cardinal holders of the archdeaconate through much of that century. In 1513, Cardinal Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici, shortly before he became Pope Leo X, in conjunction with Andrea Sansovino added the facade portico with Tuscan columns and the fountain. He was followed by Giulio di Giuliano de 'Medici, the future Pope Clement VII from 1513-7. Giovanni de' Medici became cardinal-deacon at the age of 17 in 1560, but died in 1562. He was followed by his brother Ferdinando I de' Medici, who also became Grand Duke of Tuscany. He added the coffered ceiling. Description =Exterior= The facade of the basilica is in the Renaissance style, and has a porch with five arches separated by travertine pilasters, with two square and one round window. The tympanum has the coat of arms of Pope Innocent VIII in the center, and that of cardinals Giovanni and Ferdinando de' Medici on the sides. The inconspicuous bell tower houses a bell from 1288. The design of the facade (1512-3) has been attributed to Andrea Sansovino. View of the nave towards apse Apse mosaic (9th century) commissioned by Pope Paschal I =Interior= The interior of the basilica retains its 9th century plan, and consists of a nave and two lateral aisles of equal length and separated by 18 granite columns which were spolia from an ancient temple and crowned with Corinthian capitals. The wall above the windows was frescoed by Perin del Vaga, based on designs of Giulio Romano. The nave has frescos by Lazzaro Baldi.Romecity.it entry on Santa Maria in Dominica The coffered ceiling has the Medici coat of arms in the center, with symbolic representations of Noah‚Äôs Ark and Solomon‚Äôs Temple. The triumphal arch at the apse is flanked by two porphyry columns. The mosaics of the apse from the 9th century depict Christ with two angels, and the twelve Apostles, with Moses and Elias depicted underneath. In the semi-dome, Pope Paschal (with a square halo) kissing the foot of the Blessed Virgin Mary, vested as a Byzantine noblewoman, seated on a throne with the Christ Child, and surrounded by a multitude of angels.

In general, a gaja personifies a number of positive attributes, including abundance, fertility and richness; boldness and strength; and wisdom and royalty. In European Portuguese, it means \\"physically attractive female\\"; its origin in the Portuguese language can be related to a personification of fertility, as mentioned. History In the context of the history of Ancient India, the earliest depiction of gaja is found on the seals discovered at sites (like Harappa and Mohenjo Daro) of the Indus Valley Civilization (3000 BC ‚Äì 1700 BC). Some scholars believe that by that time elephants had been tamed and domesticated, and used for peaceful and possibly for other purposes. Rigveda 8-33-8 mentions a Wild Elephant.http://sacred- texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv08033.htm Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya reports use of war elephants during warfare. Over a period of time encompassing several centuries, elephants became an important part of Indian life and society, particularly of religious tradition, the royalty, and the aristocratic segment of the society. Capturing, taming and training of elephants developed into a specialized skill. In Ancient India, a number of treatises were written about caring and management of elephants, which included the following: *Palakapya‚Äôs Hastayurvea dealing with the management of good health of elephants. *Matangalila by Nilakantha Mythology The legend states that Airavata, the first elephant, emerged from the churning of the ocean. There is another mythological account, which states that Brahma created elephants. The Buddhist tradition states that Buddha came into the womb of his mother in the form of an elephant having six tusks. According to Jaina tradition, each of the mother of the twenty-four thirthankars dreamt of fourteen auspicious objects, which included an elephant. In Hinduism, Ganesh, a god with the elephant‚Äôs head has been an object of reverence and worship for more than two millennia. He is therefore called as Gajanan(Gaj=elephant, aanan= faced). Several deities and mythological figures have elephants as their conveyance (vahan) including Balarama, Skanda and aiyanar. An elephant is also one of several attributes of a Chakravartin, which he is expected to own to be bestowed with the title of Chakravatin, that is, the supreme and universal ruler.

Until the administrative centralization of 1966 it was made up of four semi-autonomous communities; Vechigen, Sinneringen with Boll and Dentenberg, Utzigen with Lindental and Berg with Littewil and Radelfingen. History Vechigen is first mentioned in 1275 as Vechingen. Sinneringen was first mentioned in 1261-63 as Sineringen. Utzigen was called Uzingen in 1275. =Vechigen= The Vechigen valley and mountain originally belonged to the Baron of Belp-Montenach. However, in 1298, they lost their land to the growing city of Bern. From then on, Vechigen was one of the four outer parishes of Bern and until 1798 residents of the village were also citizens of the city. The village church of St. Martin was first mentioned in 1275. It was rebuilt in 1513/14, the bell tower dates from 1486. In 1834 the municipality of Vechigen was formed with four quarters. The quarters were Vechigen, Sinneringen with Boll and Dentenberg, Utzigen with Lindental and Berg with Littewil and Radelfingen. Each quarter was responsible for local administration including schooling and road construction, while the municipality handled taxation and finance. In 1913 the Worblentalbahn opened a rail station in Boll-Utzigen. By 1950, the agglomeration of Bern had spread out along this line and the villages of Boll and Sinneringen became part of agglomeration area. The population grew rapidly in these two villages while it dropped or stagnated in the rest of the municipality. As the quarters changed from agricultural into residential, the decentralized government became inefficient and in 1966 it was centralized into a single government. In 1961 a secondary school was built in the municipality and there are now a total of five school buildings. =Sinneringen and Boll= Until 1966, the Sinneringen quarter included Sinneringen, the hamlets Boll and Dentenberg as well as farm houses in the Worblen valley and on the Dentenberg mountain. On the hillside above the Worblen, several Hallstatt graves were discovered. A Roman villa was found on at Hubel. During the 13th century, the Counts of Kyburg were the vogts over the village. In 1729, Hans Rudolf von Diesbach built his country estate, the Schl√∂ssli, in Sinneringen. In 1844, the artist August von Bonstetten expanded the manor house and added a clock tower. By the 1950s it was part of the agglomeration of Bern and the population increased rapidly. By 2005 over half of the population in Vechigen lives in Sinneringen and Boll. Boll developed from shops and inns at the intersection of the Bern-Krauchthal and Worb-Zollikofen roads. In the 18th-19th century it consisted of a customs station, an inn, a smithy, a saw mill and some houses. During the 19th and 20th centuries the nearby rivers were corrected and the local swamps drained. This opened up new land around Boll for housing and farms. Despite the 19th century road construction and the completion of the Worblentalbahn rail station at Utzigen-Boll in 1913, it remained a small village. However, during the 1960s the outskirts of Bern reached Boll and village expanded rapidly. The majority of the residents of Boll commute into Bern for work. =Utzigen= The Utzigen quarter included the village of Utzigen, the hamlets of Wuhl, Birchi and Lindental and 50 single houses on a hillside above the Worblental. Utzigen grew out of a Late Medieval herrschaft. Starting in the 14th century it was owned by a number of Bernese patrician families. The herrschaft was administered from Utzigen Castle. In 1669, Samuel Jenner (1624‚Äì99) built a new castle on the site of the earlier building. After the 1798 French invasion, the herrschaft was dissolved. The owners in 1798, the Dachselhofer family, lost their rights to hold the low court over the herrschaft, but they were able to retain the castle and other property. The castle became the summer residence of that family until 1875 it was sold to the municipality. The municipality established an institute for alcoholics and unemployed man and women. At its peak the institute housed over 500 people, who worked on the large farm attached to the estate. In 1964 it was converted into a nursing and retirement home and in 2001 it became a residential care home. The village has a primary school. Geography Aerial view by Walter Mittelholzer (1925) It lies about east of the city of Bern.

Early life and education Frances Alice Kellor was born October 20, 1873 in Columbus, Ohio. During Kellors‚Äô childhood, her father left the family, forcing her mother to move to Michigan to work as a laundress. Kellor could not afford to finish high school, leading her to work at a local news company where she eventually became an investigative reporter at the company. It was there that two sisters, Mary and Frances Eddy, took notice of her and helped fund Kellors‚Äô college education. She received her law degree in 1897 from Cornell Law School, and received a scholarship to study sociology and social work at the University of Chicago. It was at the University of Chicago that she wrote her first scholarly article about equality among women and men in physical education. Kellor also began her study of prisons while at University of Chicago, which would lead to her first book Experimental Sociology (1901.) Career She was secretary and treasurer of the New York State Immigration Commission in 1909 and chief investigator for the Bureau of Industries and Immigration of New York State in 1910-13. She became managing director of the North American Civic League for Immigrants and a member of the Progressive National Committee. She also oversaw the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers. She directed the National Americanization Committee (NAC), the most important private organization promoting Americanization during World War I. Speaking for the NAC in 1916, proposed to combine efficiency and patriotism in her Americanization programs. It would be more efficient, she argued, once the factory workers could all understand English and therefore better understand orders and avoid accidents. Once Americanized, they would grasp American industrial ideals and be open to American influences and not subject only to strike agitators or foreign propagandists. The result, she argued would transform indifferent and ignorant residents into understanding voters, to make their homes into American homes, and to establish American standards of living throughout the ethnic communities. Ultimately, she argued it would \\"unite foreign-born and native alike in enthusiastic loyalty to our national ideals of liberty and justice.\\"John F. McClymer, War and Welfare: Social Engineering in America, 1890-1925 (1980), 110-13 Unlike African American social reformers of the time, Kellor believed that enslavement made it impossible for African American women to lead moral, respectable lives. Kellor and her cohort of white reformers focused on improving recently emancipated African American women's efficiency, rather than attempt to challenge the racially restrictive segregationist practices of the Northern society.Cheryl D. Hicks, Talk with You Like a Woman: African American Women, Justice, and Reform in New York, 1890-1935. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2010). In 1916, she became the chairman of the Women's Committee for the National Hughes Alliance, headquartered in the Hotel Astor. The goal of the Hughes Alliance was to organize the women of the country to support Charles E. Hughes in his bid for President of the United States in 1916. = Women's activism = Kellor focused her works on Women's Rights on studying the treatment of women in education and the work force. Kellor did her work on Women's Rights by completing field work at various locations including studying women in prison, women in the Hull-House in Chicago, women employees, and women in educational settings. In 1904 Kellor published the book Out of Work, in which she discusses immigrant unemployment in the United States. In it Kellow notes that little data had been taken on women's unemployment due to the social opinion that unemployment had little to do with women. She also discussed reasons why women employees had not been able to attain the same standards through union organization as men, the helplessness of unemployed women, and unemployed women and prostitution. Kellor argued for equal treatment of women in educational settings, specifically in physical education. In 1909 she published a book in collaboration with Gertrude Dudley called Athletic Games in the Education of Women, in which they argued that participating in sports could have positive effects for women, since it would allow to them to leave the confines of the home and would make them more socially active. =Immigrant rights = Frances Kellor was secretary and treasurer of the New York State Immigration Commission in 1909 and chief investigator for the Bureau of Industries and Immigration of New York State in 1910-13. She was brought on by Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 presidential campaign, to help write the Progressive Party's platform. This election marked the first time the party had taken up immigration as a key issue. The platform promised to provide immigrants more opportunities to succeed, as well as reverse policies that neglected immigrants and their rights. Roosevelt lost the election to Woodrow Wilson, but Kellor continued her fight for immigrant rights. At the time, Kellor was the director of the North American Civic League. She began advocating for increased collaboration between private, state, and national efforts, aimed at assimilating, educating, and protecting the rapidly growing immigrant population. In 1914, she left the American Civic League and formed the Committee for Immigrants in America. This committee fought for immigrant rights and education. Kellor's efforts resulted in more than 13% of non- English-speaking immigrants enrolling in citizenship classes by 1915. The movement continued to make progress, but Kellor was not satisfied. She began pressuring the federal government to act and aide immigrants in regards to protection, education, and opportunity. Kellor organized and promoted the National Americanization Day, to be held on July 4, 1915. Over 150 cities nationwide partook in this holiday, which celebrated and welcomed naturalized immigrants . She also oversaw the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers She directed the National Americanization Committee (NAC), an important private organization promoting Americanization during World War I. Speaking for the NAC in 1916, she proposed Americanization programs that to combined efficiency and patriotism. It would be more efficient, she argued, once the factory workers could all understand English and therefore better understand orders and avoid accidents. Once Americanized, immigrants would grasp American industrial ideals and be open to American influences. This would make them less subject to strike agitators or and foreign propagandists. The result, she argued would transform less knowledgeable residents into understanding voters, making their homes into American homes, and to establishing American standards of living throughout the ethnic communities. Ultimately, she argued it would \\"unite foreign-born and native alike in enthusiastic loyalty to our national ideals of liberty and justice.\\" = Prisons = Kellor felt that crime was due to poor education and unemployment, which ran contrary to the popular belief of the time that criminality was biological. She published several articles on the American prison systems as well as one book, Experimental Sociology: Descriptive and Analytical. In her research Kellor examined race and the many conditions that led Southern African Americans criminals to engage in crime. In her articles Kellor also discussed the effect of prison life on crime and placed special emphasis on how debilitating it could be for the social life of African Americans, which in turn could perpetuate crime. She felt that two of the solutions to this issue would be rehabilitation as well as reintegration programs. Personal life Kellor never married. She maintained a long-term relationship with another woman, Mary Dreier, one of two wealthy sisters who played leading roles in the progressive movement in New York. They shared a home from 1905 until Kellor's death.Harvard University Library: \\"Dreier, Mary E. (Mary Elizabeth), 1875-1963.

Cod which has been dried without the addition of salt is stockfish. Salt cod was long a major export of the North Atlantic region, and has become an ingredient of many cuisines around the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean. With the sharp decline in the world stocks of cod, other salted and dried white fish are sometimes marketed as \\"salt cod\\", and the term has become to some extent a generic name. Dried and salted cod has been produced for over 500 years in Newfoundland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, and most particularly in Norway where it is called klippfisk, literally \\"cliff-fish\\". Traditionally it was dried outdoors by the wind and sun, often on cliffs and other bare rock-faces. Today klippfisk is usually dried indoors with the aid of electric heaters.  History  For hundreds of years fishing villages in the archipelago of Lofoten, Norway, produced dried and salted cod from cod fisheries. These villages were centred around the area now occupied by the village of Reine (pictured). The production of salt cod dates back at least 1000 years, to the time of the Vikings. When explorer Jacques Cartier discovered the mouth of the St. Lawrence River in what is now Canada and claimed it for France, he noted the presence of a thousand Basque boats fishing for cod. Salt cod formed a vital item of international commerce between the New World and the Old, and formed one leg of the so-called triangular trade. Thus it spread around the Atlantic and became a traditional ingredient not only in Northern European cuisine, but also in Mediterranean, West African, Caribbean, and Brazilian cuisines. The drying of food is the world's oldest known preservation method, and dried fish has a storage life of several years. Traditionally, salt cod was dried only by the wind and the sun, hanging on wooden scaffolding or lying on clean cliffs or rocks near the seaside. Drying preserves many nutrients, and the process of salting and drying codfish is said to make it tastier. Salting became economically feasible during the 17th century, when cheap salt from southern Europe became available to the maritime nations of northern Europe. The method was cheap and the work could be done by the fisherman or his family. The resulting product was easily transported to market, and salt cod became a staple item in the diet of the populations of Catholic countries on 'meatless' Fridays and during Lent.  Names  In Middle English dried and salted cod was called haberdine.Tanner J. R. (2013) Samuel Pepys and the Royal Navy page 61, Cambridge University Press. Dried cod and the dishes made from it are known by many names around the world, many of them derived from the root bacal-, itself of unknown origin.Sutton, David C. (2011) \\"The Stories of Bacalao: Myth, legend and History\\" In: Helen Saberi (Ed) Cured, Smoked, and Fermented, Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cooking, page 312. Explorer John Cabot reported that it was the name used by the inhabitants of Newfoundland.OED, s.v. bacalao Some of these are: bacalhau (salgado) (Portuguese), bacalao salado (Spanish), bakailao (Basque), bacall√† salat i assecat or bacall√† salat (Catalan), ŒºœÄŒ±Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒπŒ¨œÅŒøœÇ, bakali√°ros (Greek), Klippfisch (German), cabillaud (French), baccal√† (Italian), bakalar (Croatian), bakkeljauw (Dutch), bakaljaw (Maltese), makayabu (Central and East Africa), and kapakala (Finnish). Other names include r√°ktoguolli/goikeguolli (Sami), klipfisk/klippfisk/clipfish (Scandinavian, Russian), stokvis/klipvis (Dutch), saltfiskur (Icelandic), morue (French) and saltfish (Anglophone Caribbean).  Process  The fish is beheaded and eviscerated, often on board the boat or ship. (This is feasible with whitefish, whereas it would not be with oily fish.) It is then salted and dried ashore. Traditionally the fish was sun-dried on rocks or wooden frames, but modern commercial production is mainly dried indoors with electrical heating. It is sold whole or in portions, with or without bones. = Species of fish = Prior to the collapse of the Grand Banks (and other) stocks due to overfishing, salt cod was derived exclusively from Atlantic cod. Since then products sold as salt cod may be derived from other whitefish, such as pollock, haddock, blue whiting, ling and tusk. In South America, catfish of the genera Pseudoplatystoma are used to produce a salted, dried and frozen product typically sold around Lent. = Quality grades = In Norway, there used to be five different grades of salt cod. The best grade was called superior extra. Then came (in descending order) superior, imperial, universal and popular. These appellations are no longer extensively used, although some producers still make the superior products. The best klippfisk, the superior extra, is made only from line-caught cod. The fish is always of the skrei, the cod that once a year is caught during spawning. The fish is bled while alive, before the head is cut off. It is then cleaned, filleted and salted. Fishers and connoisseurs alike place a high importance in the fact that the fish is line-caught, because if caught in a net, the fish may be dead before caught, which may result in bruising of the fillets. For the same reason it is believed to be important that the klippfisk be bled while still alive. Superior klippfisk is salted fresh, whereas the cheaper grades of klippfisk might be frozen first. Lower grades are salted by injecting a salt-water solution into the fish, while superior grades are salted with dry salt. The superior extra is dried twice, much like Parma ham. Between the two drying sessions, the fish rests and the flavour matures.  Culinary uses  Cod fish bacalao served at a restaurant in Norway Before it can be eaten, salt cod must be rehydrated and desalinated by soaking in cold water for one to three days, changing the water two to three times a day. In Europe, the fish is prepared for the table in a wide variety of ways;Sanju√°n, 2009 most commonly with potatoes and onions in a casserole, as croquettes, or as battered, deep-fried pieces. In France, brandade de morue is a popular baked gratin dish of potatoes mashed with rehydrated salted cod, seasoned with garlic and olive oil. Some Southern France recipes skip the potatoes altogether and blend the salted cod with seasonings into a paste. There is a particularly wide variety of salt cod dishes in Portuguese cuisine. In Greece, fried cod is often served with skordalia. Salt cod is part of many European celebrations of the Christmas Vigil, in particular the southern Italian Feast of the Seven Fishes. In several islands of the West Indies, it forms the basis of the common dish saltfish. In Jamaica, the national dish is ackee and saltfish. In Bermuda, it is served with potatoes, avocado, banana and boiled egg in the traditional codfish and potato breakfast. In some regions of Mexico, it is fried with egg batter, then simmered in red sauce and served for Christmas dinner. In Liverpool, England, prior to the post-war slum clearances, especially around the docks, salt fish was a popular traditional Sunday morning breakfast.

His expedition is considered the first international vaccination campaign in history and one of the most important events in the history of medicine. It has inspired recent vaccination efforts such as that of Dr. Carlos Canseco, President of Rotary International, to start the worldwide program Polio Plus to eradicate polio.  Biography  = Education and military career = Francisco Javier de Balmis was born in Alicante on December 2, 1753 and was baptized three days later at the Basilica of Santa Maria. His parents were Antonio Balmis, a barber surgeon of French origin and Luisa Berenguer.Fundaci√≥n Francisco X. de Balmis He followed the family tradition and at age 17 began studying at the military hospital of Alicante, where he stayed for five years.E. Moreno Caballero, Sesi√≥n apolog√©tica dedicada al Dr. D. Francisco Xavier de Balmis y Berenguer, discours prononc√© devant l'Instituto M√©dico Valenciano le 18 novembre 1885, Valencia Imp. de Ferrer de Orga, 1885, . In 1775, he enlisted in the Spanish Navy and joined an expedition under the command of Alejandro O'Reilly which aimed to put an end to the incursions of the Barbary pirates in the Spanish Levante. Two years later he passed his examination and in 1778 obtained the authorization to perform surgery in Valencia. Due to the siege of Gibraltar, he joined the core of military surgeons as assistant second surgeon. By April 8, 1781 he had attained the rank of surgeon and joined the regiment at Zamora. As part of this regiment he went to America in the expedition of the Marquess of Socorro. From the Venezuelan port of La Guaira, he embarked for Havana, then for Verzcruz, and was the director of the hospital of Xalapa for three months. In 1786 he was appointed surgeon-major of the military hospital of San Juan de Dios in Mexico City, then the capital of New Spain. After the merger of this hospital with that of San Andres in 1790, Balmis become director of venereal disease ward. In recognition of his work he was admitted to the Real Academia M√©dica Matritense (the predecessor to the Royal Academy of Medicine) and received his bachelor of arts from the University of Mexico.E. Balaguer Perig√ºell et R. Ballester A√±on, En el nombre de los Ni√±os, . :Es:Real Academia M√©dica Matritense = Scientific work = During 1788, on temporary leave from the army, he traveled throughout Mexico to devote himself to the study of local flora and traditional remedies used by natives. He conducted a series of experiments at the hospital of San Juan de Dios, publishing Tratado de las virtudes del agave y la begonia (Treatise on the benefits of agave and begonia) in Madrid in 1794. Back in Spain, he became the physician of King Charles IV. He persuaded the king to send an expedition to America to propagate the recently discovered vaccine against smallpox. Balmis was named head of the expedition, which sailed from Spain in 1804. He traveled to Puerto Rico, Puerto Cabello, Caracas, Havana, M√©rida, Veracruz and Mexico City. The vaccine was carried as far as Texas in the north and New Granada in the south. In Mexico City, he had to convince the viceroy, Jos√© de Iturrigaray, but he did so, and the viceroy had his son vaccinated. In 1806 Balmis sailed from Acapulco for Manila, and in 1806 he arrived back in Spain. He returned to Mexico again in 1810. He wrote Instrucci√≥n sobre la introducci√≥n y conservaci√≥n de la vacuna (Instructions for the introduction and conservation of the vaccine), and translated Moreau's work on the same subject, Tratado hist√≥rico-pr√°ctico, from the French. He died at Madrid in 1819. Miguel Mu√±oz conserved and spread the vaccine in Mexico until 1844, when the project was taken over by his son Luis. After Luis Mu√±oz, Luis Malanco was in charge of the project. Gallery File:Balmis Begonia.jpgDrawing of a begonia showing flowers, seed pods, and leaves.

Stern School of Business at New York University. His primary area of expertise is the economic and business implications of information technology, the Internet, and online media. He is the co-founder (with Chris F. Kemerer) of the Workshop on Information Systems and Economics (WISE), and the co-inventor of Flexplay DVDs. Early life Bakos holds a Ph.D. in Management and an MBA in Finance from the MIT Sloan School of Management. He also received a Masters in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a B.S. in Computer Engineering from MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Before coming to NYU, Professor Bakos was on the faculty of the Merage School of Business at the University of California, Irvine and the Sloan School of Management at MIT. Career Bakos' early work showed that the internet would reduce the search costs of buyers and sellers, and that the resulting electronic marketplaces would result in lower prices and more competition among the sellers. He has more recently studied pricing strategies for information. For example, his work with Erik Brynjolfsson showed that Product bundling can be particularly effective for \\"digital information goods\\" with very low or zero marginal cost. In other recent work, he has been studying how reputation mechanisms, like the ones used by eBay, offer an alternative to traditional litigation as a way to settle disputes. Bakos is the co-inventor of Flexplay DVDs, which are limited play DVDs that expire a preset period after the package is opened. Expiration is triggered when a special chemical layer in the DVD is exposed to oxygen in the air, and thus does not depend on the electronics of the DVD player. This invention received several U.S. and international patents. Dr. Bakos co- founded Flexplay Technologies, where he was Chairman of the Board from 2001 until the company was sold to the Convex Group in 2004. Disney released about 100 movies in the U.S. using this technology under the ez-D trade name, and the technology was used in Japan until 2010.

Other common names include Cooktown birdwing and northern birdwing.Braby (2004) p. 124 The names Cairns and Cooktown in its common name reference the Australian cities in the region where this butterfly is found. Description The wingspan can be up to in females, and in males. A closely allied species, the New Guinea or Priam's birdwing (Ornithoptera priamus) reaches and is the largest butterfly species found in Australia, but it is not endemic. O. euphorion is quite closely related to O. richmondia, differing by its greater size and more extensive green markings in the male. Males have a predominantly black upper wing with emerald green flashes, however the female lacks the green colouring, having a plain black upper wing with white patches. The female is the larger of the two sexes. There was a spectacular and rare genetic mutation of this butterfly, where single aberrant female produced less than 40 aberrant progeny. The females were pale instead of dark, and the males were golden instead of green.Golden Birdwing, Insect Company. File:OrnithopteraCassandraRippon.jpgMale from Icones Ornithopterorum. File:OrnithopteraCassandra2Rippon.jpgFemale from Icones Ornithopterorum. Note the lack the green colouration. Distribution Cairns birdwings are found southwards from Mount Webb and Cooktown to Mackay in Queensland. Its favoured habitat is rainforest of the Queensland wet tropics region, including riverine forest, and particularly near the coast. It is also often seen in Cairns, attracted to the flowers of Lantana, Hibiscus and Bougainvillea in suburban gardens. The species is abundant throughout its range and is not threatened. Biology Adult male emerging from chrysalis Copulating pair (female above, male below) at Melbourne Zoo Ova: The eggs are very slightly larger than those of O. richmondia. A female may lay as many as 300 eggs in her lifetime. Larva: Larvae are very similar to those of O. richmondia, with colouration varying from light to dark grey. Food plants known to be utilised by the larvae are Aristolochia acuminata, A. indica, A. pubera, A. thoszetti, Pararistolochia australopithecurus, P. deltantha and P. sparusifolia. The leaves of the introduced Dutchman's pipe (Aristolochia littoralis) will kill the larvae of this species and several other swallowtail butterflies in Australia. Consequently, it is discouraged to plant Dutchman's pipe in Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory. Pupa: Like most other species of its genus, the pupa is light brown and yellow. Imago: Adult males have been known to guard females with which they have recently mated, possibly to ensure that the sphragis (mating plug) does not become dislodged by another male, as it will not fully harden until approximately one day later. Both sexes support their weight when feeding at flowers by rapidly fluttering their wings. Males occasionally compete for flowers with other nectarivores, such as small birds, and usually succeed at driving them off by aggressively flying towards them. Adults are very likely to be unpalatable to vertebrates, due to feeding on Aristolochia as a larva, although they do sometimes fall prey to the golden silk orb-weaver spider.

The siege was a decisive Franco-American victory: after the surrender of British Lt. Gen. Charles, Earl Cornwallis on October 17, the government of Lord North fell, and its replacement entered into peace negotiations that resulted in British recognition of American independence with the 1783 Treaty of Paris. The siege involved land forces from the United States, including the Continental Army and state militias, as well as land forces under French and British command. The British forces included a large number of troops from various German principalities of the Holy Roman Empire that were collectively known as Hessians. Since Yorktown, Virginia was specifically selected by Cornwallis for its properties as a deep-water port, both sides had naval support as well: the British forces included some Royal Navy vessels, and the Franco-American allies were supported by a large French fleet, some of whose marines were landed to assist in siege operations. German historians have noted that approximately one third of all the land forces involved were either hired or recruited from German states, or were German immigrants to America; this has led the siege to be known in German historiography as \\"die Deutsche Schlacht\\" (\\"the German battle\\"). The following units and commanders of the British, American, and French forces fought in the Siege of Yorktown, or provided significant local support. British Army The British Army forces present at Yorktown arrived in Virginia in four separate detachments. The first was sent from New York City in December 1780 under the command of the turncoat Brigadier General Benedict Arnold. The second was sent from New York in March 1781 under the command of Major General William Phillips to reinforce Arnold after a Franco-American threat. The third detachment to arrive was that of General Cornwallis, who had been active in the Carolinas and, following the Battle of Guilford Court House on March 15, decided to join forces with Arnold and Phillips. This was contrary to instructions from his superior, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, British Commander-in-Chief in North America. He arrived at Petersburg, Virginia in late May to take command of the troops there; Phillips had died of a fever just a week before, and Arnold returned to New York not long after Cornwallis arrived. While at Petersburg, Cornwallis was joined by a fourth detachment from New York that was under the command of the Hessian Colonel August von Voigt. With this force, numbering about 7,200, Cornwallis first chased after the army of the Marquis de Lafayette, a much smaller force of Continental Army and local militiamen that had provided some resistance to the movements of Phillips and Arnold. Cornwallis was eventually ordered by General Clinton to establish a fortified deep-water port at either Yorktown or Portsmouth. Cornwallis chose Yorktown, and began constructing fortifications there and Gloucester Point, just across the York River from Yorktown, in August 1781. = British Forces = Commander, Lt. Gen.

After Arnold was sent to Virginia, Major General George Washington, the American commander-in-chief, in January 1781 sent the Marquis de Lafayette to Virginia with 900 men. He was to be followed promptly by troops from the Pennsylvania Line under the command of Brigadier General Anthony Wayne, but Wayne did not arrive in Virginia until June. Lafayette's force included a substantial number of Virginia militia, and he shadowed Cornwallis during the movements that ended at Yorktown, with a skirmish at Spencer's Ordinary and a larger battle at Green Spring being their only significant encounters. The main Continental Army of General Washington was at first stationed outside New York City, which Washington hoped to besiege with the assistance of the French army. However, word from Admiral Paul de Grasse of the French West Indies fleet would sail north to assist in operations on the Chesapeake Bay convinced Washington that action was best taken against Cornwallis's army in Virginia. Accordingly, the American and French armies set out in mid-August for Virginia. Some troops went overland the entire way; others were transported on the Chesapeake by ships of the French Navy.

The larger force, under the command of Lieutenant General the Comte de Rochambeau, landed at Newport, Rhode Island in 1780, and marched overland to join Washington's army outside New York in the summer of 1781. These troops marched with Washington's army from New York to Yorktown. More of the French troops were transported by boat on the Chesapeake than Americans, due to the French fleet commanders' preferences for transporting their own. The second source for French troops was the Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti), where Admiral de Grasse picked up more than 3,000 troops under the command of Major General Claude- Anne de Rouvroy de Saint Simon before departing for North America. The land forces were also supplemented by a number of marines provided by de Grasse in support of the siege. The French order of battle is listed below. * Commander Lt. Gen.

Plot summary In Flynn's previous novel, Memorial Day, CIA counter-terror operative and assassin Mitch Rapp uncovered an Al-Qaeda plot to use a nuclear weapon obtained from abandoned Russian nuclear storage bunkers. The ultimate goal was the destruction of Washington, D.C., and Rapp was forced to torture the only man who knew the details of the plan: Waheed Abdullah. Rapp then faked Waheed's death to prevent the Saudi Government from learning of it and rescuing him, while preserving a useful source for himself. To keep Waheed from being discovered, Rapp puts him in an Afghan prison. However, this plan backfires: Waheed's father, Saeed Ahmed Abdullah, a billionaire Saudi businessman and a jihadist himself, learns that Rapp has \\"killed\\" his son. Saeed beseeches Saudi Prince Muhammed bin Rashid for help. Rashid puts Saeed in contact with a former East German Stasi officer, Erich Abel, and Saeed puts a $20 million contract on Rapp's head. Abel, through his contacts, approaches two assassins, a husband and wife team, Louis Gould and Claudia Morrell. For $10 million, they agree to kill Rapp. Claudia, who is pregnant, specifically asks Louis not to kill Rapp's wife, Anna, as she is also pregnant. Louis agrees, and both leave for America. In Washington, Rapp is angered by the new Director of National Intelligence, Mark Ross, who authorized surveillance of Rapp's co-worker and friend, former Navy SEAL Scott Coleman. Ross sends the IRS to investigate Coleman, and requests Coleman's personnel file from the Navy. Ross has ambitions to the presidency and views his current position as a stepping stone to the White House. He has no respect for Rapp because of Rapp's reckless actions and, despite his contributions, wants to fire him. Rapp decides to visit Ross to stop his investigation of Coleman, but he loses his famous temper when he finds a satellite photo of Coleman and discovers his friend was an active topic of interest. He physically holds the National Security adviser by the collar and slaps him with a folder holding Coleman's files. Rapp warns Ross not to interfere with the War on Terror. His words fall on deaf ears, though, and Ross decides that he must fire Rapp. Since Rapp has the president's full support, Ross decides he has to do it carefully. Later, Rapp injures his left knee during a morning jog, and encounters the assassins Gould and Claudia, both dressed as bicyclists, examining his house. Rapp doesn't suspect anything and continues limping back towards his house. The next day, Rapp undergoes arthroscopic knee surgery. He and his wife Anna come home and as they settle down in their house, Louis detonates a bomb that kills Anna and throws a severely wounded Rapp into Chesapeake Bay where he is saved by a nearby boater. The CIA fakes Rapp's death and takes him to a safehouse to recuperate. In a secret meeting with Irene Kennedy, Director of the CIA, President Hayes tells Kennedy that Rapp has his consent to kill any and all people involved in the murder of his wife. Saudi Prince Rashid, who is visiting U.S., finds out from Director Ross that Rapp is in fact not dead. Ross carelessly informs Rashid of Rapp's safehouse location. Rashid orders his assistant, Saudi intelligence agent Nawaf Tayyib, to kill Rapp and Abel. Tayyib hires Latino gang leader Anibal Castillo to kill Rapp at the safehouse. Tayyib then goes hunting for the go-between Abel with two of his men, to sever the chain of contacts leading back to the prince. Castillo and thirteen of his men attack the safehouse. Rapp kills all of Castillo's men, then wounds Castillo and brings him in to be questioned. Through different leads Rapp discovers Saeed was the one who put a bounty on his head. Rapp goes to Afghanistan and gets Waheed out of prison, giving Waheed the impression that it is a hostage exchange. Rapp has Waheed unknowingly wear a vest full of explosives. As the released Waheed embraces his father in the street, Rapp pulls out a detonator and blows Saeed and Waheed and twelve of Saeed's bodyguards to pieces. The CIA in the meantime has found out about Erich Abel's role in hiring the assassins and sends Rapp to Abel's office. There Rapp finds Tayyib torturing Abel's secretary for information on Abel's whereabouts. Rapp kills Tayyib's men, and he and Coleman capture Tayyib. A conscience-stricken Claudia is revealed to be the one who gave the CIA information on Abel. Abel's secretary reveals to Rapp and Coleman that Abel is in Austria. Rapp flies there and captures Abel at his mountain retreat and tortures him for information. Abel reveals that Rashid was the mastermind behind the plot. He also gives information on the assassins. After hearing this, Rapp, who has become much more violent and vengeful after the killing of his wife, burns Abel alive inside the house. Rapp travels to Spain where Rashid is staying. Coleman bribes Rashid's guards, who are British SAS sympathetic to Rapp, to let them in. Rapp completely covers Tayyib's body with explosives and drops him off in front of the mosque where Rashid is staying. Once Rashid's personal guards have Tayyib in custody, Rapp detonates the explosives, killing Tayyib and all the guards. Rapp finds Rashid and beats him severely before he puts a thermal grenade in his mouth and pulls the pin, melting Rashid's head. In the epilogue, set nine months later, Rapp trails Louis and Claudia to Tahiti. Claudia has had her baby and Louis has retired. Rapp aims a gun at Louis's head, but once he hears that the baby was named after his deceased wife, he realizes she would not want her death avenged like this. He turns and leaves Louis, Claudia, and Anna unharmed. He then throws the gun into the ocean and continues walking down the boardwalk outside. Film adaptation In a radio interview on the Hugh Hewitt show on February 6, 2009, Vince Flynn disclosed that he has signed a movie deal for this book to be the first of the Mitch Rapp books to make it to the big screen. The screenplay was written by Jonathan Lemkin but it has not yet been picked up by a studio. On January 1, 2010, Variety announced that Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter, Olympus Has Fallen) would direct a planned adaptation of Consent to Kill for CBS Films with Lorenzo DiBonaventura and Nick Wechsler producing. Though CBS Films has expressed interest in Gerard Butler, Colin Farrell and Matthew Fox as possible candidates for Mitch Rapp Teen Wolf alum Dylan O'Brien subsequently won the part by 2016.

History Aerial view (1962) Wileroltigen is first mentioned in 1263 as Wiler sita prope Oltingen. The municipality was formerly known by its French name Ostranges, however, that name is no longer used. During the Early Middle Ages the region around Wileroltigen belonged to St. Maurice's Abbey. In 962, the Abbey donated the land to Payerne Priory, which held it until the 13th century when the Herrschaft of Oltigen acquired the land. In 1412 the entire Herrschaft, including Wileroltigen, was absorbed by Bern. It was eventually combined with the villages of Gurbr√º and Golaten to form a court in the bailiwick of Laupen. The village shared a bridge over the Saane/Sarine river with the village of Marfeldingen (part of the M√ºhleberg municipality) by 1325. During the 15th century it was replaced with a ferry. After the Act of Mediation, in 1803, Wileroltigen was assigned to the Canton of Bern despite the protests of the Canton of Fribourg. In 1528 both Wileroltigen and the parish church at Kerzers converted to the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and the village remained part of the parish of Kerzers. However, the village St. Mary Magdalene chapel was abandoned after the Reformation. A village school opened in 1659. Geography Fields and houses in Wileroltigen Wileroltigen has an area of .

He is the former U.S. Representative for , serving from 2007 until 2013 as a member of the Democratic Party. Prior to entering Congress, Altmire worked as a health care industry lobbyist. Notably for a Democrat, he voted against President Barack Obama's landmark legislation, the Affordable Care Act, in 2010. After leaving Congress in 2013, he has worked for health insurance companies and health care business consulting firms. Early life and education Altmire was born in western Pennsylvania, where he was raised an only child in a single parent home. A record-breaking high school athlete, he set a school record in track and field and was recognized as an all-star wide receiver in football before a serious knee injury kept him off the athletic field as a senior. In 1986, he matriculated at Florida State University, in Tallahassee. Following a lengthy rehabilitation of his knee injury, he tried out for and made the Seminole football team as a walk on, frequently working in practice against legendary defensive back Deion Sanders. He graduated in 1990 with a B.S. in Political Science and worked in the Tallahassee campaign office of Pete Peterson, then a candidate for Congress in Florida's Second Congressional District. He later earned a Master's in Health Administration from George Washington University in Washington, D.C.. Early career = Politics = After Pete Peterson won the 1990 congressional race against incumbent Republican Congressman Bill Grant, he hired Altmire to work in his Capitol Hill office. Altmire worked as a legislative assistant during Peterson's three terms in office (1991‚Äì1996), specializing in domestic policy issues. In 1993, Altmire was appointed to a working group for President Bill Clinton‚Äôs Task Force on National Health Care Reform. = Health care industry lobbyist = In 1996, when Peterson was named U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, Altmire continued his work in health care policy by taking a job as a lobbyist for the Federation of American Hospitals. In 1998, Altmire returned to Western Pennsylvania to work as a lobbyist for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). By 2005, he was the acting Vice President for Government Relations and Community Health Services. In 2003 he was named by Pittsburgh Magazine as one of Pittsburgh's \\"40 under 40\\",2003 Pittsburgh Magazine and in 2005 he was awarded the Arcadia Award by Northern Allegheny Chamber of Commerce.\\"Pgh Tribune-Review, May 1, 2005.\\" Political career = Elections = Altmire left UPMC in June 2005 to run against three-term incumbent Republican U.S. Congresswoman Melissa Hart of Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district, who was considered by most observers to be invulnerable. In May 2006, Altmire won the Democratic primary, defeating millionaire businesswoman Georgia Berner, 55%‚Äì45%. In the 2006 general election, Altmire campaigned relentlessly and raised over $1 million to help fund his race against Hart.Congressional Races After polling well behind Hart early in the race, he eventually closed the gap heading into the final weeks before the election. Altmire defeated Hart, 52%‚Äì48%. In 2008, Hart ran again in a rematch but was defeated by Altmire 56%‚Äì44%, even as John McCain carried the district by almost 11 points. In the historic 2010 wave election that saw Democrats lose 63 seats in the U.S. House, including five in Pennsylvania, Altmire survived. He was re-elected to a third term, defeating attorney Keith Rothfus, 51%‚Äì49%. Following the 2010 census, Pennsylvania lost one congressional seat. The Republican-controlled state legislature dismantled Altmire's district, and most of its territory was merged with the neighboring 12th District, represented by fellow Democratic congressman Mark Critz, who defeated Altmire 51% to 49% in the primary election. Critz went on to lose the 2012 general election to Rothfus, Altmire's 2010 opponent. =Tenure= Altmire was a moderate Democrat. He did not miss a single vote during his first two terms and continued the unbroken voting streak into his sixth year in office, which was the longest House voting streak during that time. The streak finally ended at 4734 consecutive votes when Altmire attended a White House ceremony for Leslie H. Sabo, Jr. a former resident of Altmire‚Äôs district who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President Obama. Over the course of his six years in office, Altmire returned more than $1 million in unspent office funds, citing a desire to lead by example and be a steward of taxpayer money. Altmire successfully fought to guarantee the enlistment bonuses of combat-wounded veterans, and he forced a 2007 policy change allowing Vietnam- era Gold Star families access to White House tours after a constituent was denied. He made several trips to the Middle East during his time in office, visiting U.S. troops and meeting with foreign leaders in Yemen, Iraq, and Israel, among other countries. Altmire opposed the use of Chinese-made steel in the construction of the U.S.- Mexico border fence. Following the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Altmire helped in the rescue of two constituents and the 54 orphans under their care. He also authored the legislation that ended the late enrollment penalty for low-income seniors participating in the Medicare Part D program. During the 2008 presidential primary election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton sought Altmire's support as a superdelegate.Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, \\"HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton,\\" Crown Publishers, New York, 2014. Altmire did not endorse a candidate in the race and remained neutral throughout the primary. According to the book HRC: State Secrets by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, this could be a reason why Bill Clinton campaigned against Altmire four years later, when the congressman was involved in a contested primary election of his own. Altmire voted against the Affordable Care Act on March 21, 2010; he had also voted against earlier versions of the bill. His vote on final passage of the bill was highly sought after by President Obama and Democratic congressional leaders. According to Washington Post health care policy writer CeCi Connolly, \\"Altmire, more than most in Congress, understood the intricacies of health-care policy. As a congressional aide in the 1990s, he had worked on Clinton's failed effort and later became a hospital executive.\\"Connolly, CeCi, Landmark: The Inside Story of America's New Health- Care law--The Affordable Care Act--and What It Means for Us All,\\" PublicAffairs, New York, 2010, page 57. Days before the vote on final passage of the bill, President Obama had personally tried to persuade Altmire, telling him \\"I want to give you something to think about before the vote. Picture yourself on Monday morning. You wake up and look at the paper. It's the greatest thing Congress has done in 50 years. And you were on the wrong team.\\" After leaving Congress in 2013, Altmire became the executive of a Florida health insurance company and expressed support for the Affordable Care Act. From 2007 to 2010, he served as chairman of the House Small Business Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation. during which time he took the lead in passing through the House his legislation to help small businesses acquire private capital investment. As chairman, he introduced legislation to assist small businesses affected by deployments of employees serving in the United States National Guard. The bill garnered widespread bipartisan support and was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2008.

The hospital is part of Barwon Health, Victoria's largest regional health care provider, which has 21 sites. It is the largest hospital in regional Victoria and the only tertiary hospital outside of the Melbourne Metropolitan area. The site is bounded by Ryrie, Bellarine, Myers, and Swanston Streets. History Geelong Hospital in 1921. Originally opened as the Geelong Infirmary and Benevolent Asylum in 1852 on the Ryrie Street site, it treated 344 inpatients in its first year. By 1862 the number of patients treated had increased to 2450. By the 1890s the buildings were deeded obsolete, with proposals being made for the hospital's relocation to Eastern Park. This was blocked by the city council who objected to the loss of parkland.The University of Melbourne, History of Medicine, Dentistry & Health Sciences at Melbourne - Geelong Hospital, Barwon Health Clinical School, unimelb.edu.au, http://www.chs.unimelb.edu.au/programs/jnmhu/umfm/biogs/FM00330b.htm, Accessed via Windows Internet Explorer 14 January 2007 By 1917 a public meeting was held calling for a new hospital, to be dedicated to the memory of Lord Kitchener. A building fund was set up, and work started in October 1922. The Geelong and District Kitchener Memorial Hospital as it was known opened on 13 March 1924. The original building consisted of a central administration block which remained until 2007, with wards branching off to each side. From 1927 the Gala Day festival in Geelong helped raise money for the hospital. Further additions to the buildings included the boiler house on Swanston Street, the Kardinia Ward along Bellarine Street in the 1920s, and the Baxter House maternity hospital in 1954 (now the Geelong Private Hospital). The 1960s saw the Birdsey Wing built behind the existing buildings, with the 1980s seeing the demolition of the old western wards and their replacement with the Heath Wing containing the new emergency department and main entrance. The Dax House psychiatric ward was also built at this time. The Andrew Love cancer centre was built in the early 1990s on the site of the older eastern wards. Recent history The Baxter House maternity hospital was closed in the late 1990s, being relocated into a redeveloped Dax House and renamed the Bellarine Centre. The psychiatric wards were moved into the former Swanston Street Primary School which had closed some years earlier. The Geelong Private Hospital took over the empty Baxter House. The Andrew Love cancer centre was redeveloped during 2006, and a new main entrance was provided to the hospital from Bellarine Street. A new administration office and emergency ward has been constructed on the Ryrie Street side of the hospital. In 2015, a new wing was opened atop the existing emergency and administration building to allow for further capacity, especially in orthopaedic and oncology services. A helipad has also been opened atop the new wing, allowing for quicker ambulance access to the hospital. Services As the only tertiary referral centre in regional Victoria, it provides service covering nearly all specialities, with the exception of organ transplant and neurosurgery. It has a primary catchment area of over 350,000 people, which a catchment area of over 500,000 for some specialities.

He is counted amongst the great pioneers of the game on the European continent. Jimmy Hogan enjoyed some success as a footballer, reaching an FA Cup Semi-final with Fulham in 1908, but it was as a coach that his abilities shone through. Upon the outbreak of the First World War Jimmy was working in Austria, and was interned as an enemy alien. During this time however he was involved in coaching Hungarian club MTK, actions which were negatively perceived by some in the United Kingdom. Early life James Hogan was born in 1882 into an Irish Catholic family in Lancashire, the son of James Hogan, he grew up in Burnley and received his early education at St Mary Magdalene RC School at Gannow, his father hoped he would enter the Priesthood and sent him to study as a Boarder at the Salford Diocesan Junior Seminary St Bede's College, Manchester in September 1896. He graduated at Midsummer 1900 after deciding not to pursue his vocation any further, but was College Head Boy in the 1899/1900 Academic Year. After leaving school he became a footballer, and latterly a football coach, working across Europe and was teaching in Austria at the outbreak of World War One, when he was arrested and interned as an enemy alien. After the war he returned to England and moved to Liverpool to be with his family, whom he had not seen for four years, and gained employment at Walker's Tobacco in Everton. Career Hogan is considered one of the great pioneers of the game on the continent, especially in Austria, Hungary, Switzerland and Germany. At the age of 28, Hogan began his coaching career. Following a 10‚Äì0 win by Bolton Wanderers over Dutch club FC Dordrecht during a pre-season tour, Hogan vowed to return to Dordrecht in order to \\"teach those fellows how to play properly\\". After accepting a two- year contract at the club, Hogan set about improving the team's, mostly made up of students, fitness and ball control, as well as implementing the Combination Game, reminiscent of the quick passing that Queen's Park had popularised in the second half of the 1800s. Impressed by his methods, the Netherlands recruited Hogan to manage a game in October 1910 against Germany, which the Netherlands won 2‚Äì1. Upon the expiry of his contract with Dordrecht, Hogan returned in a playing capacity for Bolton. In Switzerland he coached ca. 1924 Young Boys Berne. In that period he was also besides his compatriot Teddy Duckworth, then coach of Servette FC, and the Hungarian Izidor \\"Dori\\" K√ºrschner, then coach of FC Nordstern Basel, responsible for one of three regional coaching groups preparing the Swiss national team for the Olympics 1924 in Paris. Duckworth would take the team there to the final, losing to the giants of that era, Uruguay, 0‚Äì3. This is up to now the greatest success in Swiss footballing history. In 1925 and from 1933 to 1934, Hogan coached Lausanne Sports. Partly responsible for the development of football in mainland Europe, Hogan formed a partnership with Hugo Meisl ‚Äì coaching the Austrian national team to unprecedented success. After a brief spell as Fulham boss, Hogan returned to Austria, where he coached them to the 1936 Olympic final. Aston Villa appointed Hogan as their manager in November 1936. This was following the embarrassment of the club's first ever relegation the previous season. Within two seasons, Hogan had guided Villa back to the top flight. Beyond the assignments mentioned, he has also coached the teams of Hung√°ria and Dresdner SC. Hogan also had a short spell in the early 1950s as a coach at Celtic. His ideas, which emphasised greater ball control, were often dismissed within British football, although he did have a formative influence on the generation of managers who would emerge in the 1960s, from Hungary, Netherlands, and Germany just to name a few.Helmut Sch√∂n: Fu√üball. Erinnerungen. Ullstein Verlag, Berlin 1978, . S66/67. He joined Brentford as coach in September 1948. He is sometimes credited with the revolution in European football that saw Hungary thrash England 6‚Äì3 at Wembley in 1953, ushering in a new football era. After the match, S√°ndor Barcs, then president of the Hungarian Football Federation, said to the press, \\"Jimmy Hogan taught us everything we know about football.\\" Guszt√°v Sebes, the Hungarian footballer and coach, said of Hogan, \\"We played football as Jimmy Hogan taught us.

It is the main center of the plain known as Basso Lodigiano, which has about 90,000 inhabitants. It received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on June 26, 1955. History There is evidence of a settlement dating back to Roman penetration of Gaul, where it is thought to have been used as a castrum. The Latin form of the name Codogna was \\"Cothoneum\\" and is believed to derive from the name of the consul Aurelius Cotta, conqueror of the Gauls, who inhabited these lands at that time. However, it is not until 997 C.E. that the name of the town is found in print. It is mentioned in a charter of Emperor Otto II. It has also been suggested that the name may be derived from the cydonia apple, or the melo cotogno, a variety of quince, both common in this region. In 1441, after long jurisdiction by the bishops of Lodi, the settlement was sold to the Venetian family Fagnani by Filippo Maria Visconti, the Duke of Milan and subsequently, in 1450, to Gian Giacomo Trivulzio under whom it was granted the status of borgo (\\"burg\\", a fortified town) by Francesco I Sforza. During this time, Codogno had developed a thriving commercial life, and having a fiercely autonomous spirit, they wished to be independent of Trivulzio. The Codognesi sought inclusion in the jurisdiction of Piacenza in order to have a wider and freer market. Thus, by an act ratified on April 21, 1492, they became citizens of Piacenza. To demonstrate their gratitude, they altered their coat-of-arms to show the Roman she-wolf (the symbol of Piacenza), tied to a quince tree (the symbol of Codogno) with a gold chain. Codogno became the centre of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy when a 38-year-old Italian went to a local clinic reporting respiratory issues on 16 February 2020. From Codogno, the virus spread quickly throughout Italy and the city was later quarantined on 22 February.

Jacks, was an English educator, philosopher, and Unitarian minister who rose to prominence in the period from World War I to World War II. Early life Jacks was born on 9 October 1860 in Nottingham. In 1882, he enrolled in Manchester New College (which then was in London). After graduating with a M.A. in 1886, he spent a year at Harvard University, where he studied with the philosopher Josiah Royce. In 1887, he became assistant minister to Stopford Brooke in his chapel in Bloomsbury, London. He served as assistant minister for a year, and then accepted a position as Unitarian minister for Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel in Liverpool. In 1889 Jacks married Olive Brooke, the daughter of Stopford Brooke. They had six children together. During this time, Jacks' circle of associates included George Bernard Shaw, Sidney and Beatrice Webb, and Oscar Wilde.Richard Aldrich and Peter Gordon, Dictionary of British Educationists. London: Woburn, 1989. (p. 129) Jacks was appointed minister for the Church of the Messiah, Birmingham in 1894. Oxford Jacks served as Principal of Manchester College, which was by then based in Oxford, from 1915 until his retirement in 1931. Jacks served as the editor of the Hibbert Journal from its founding in 1902 until 1948. Under his editorship the Journal became one of the leading forums in England for work in philosophy and religion, and introduced the work of Alfred Loisy to British readers. In September 1915, he wrote in support of the war effort, citing the need to defeat German militarism and defend \\"the liberties of our race.\\" His article, titled \\"The Peacefulness of Being at War\\" in The New Republic, argued that the war had \\"brought to England a peace of mind such as she had not possessed for decades,\\" claiming that the sense of common purpose brought on by the war had overcome social fragmentation and improved English life. Jacks was interested in parapsychology and was President for the Society for Psychical Research (1917-1918).\\"Lawrence Pearsall Jacks\\". Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. After the war, Jacks wrote prolifically and gained popularity as a lecturer in Britain and America. He frequently returned to the theme of militarism and the \\"mechanical\\" mindset, which he regarded as one of the greatest threats in modern life. In his Revolt Against Mechanism (1933), he wrote that \\"The mechanical mind has a passion for control‚Äîof everything except itself. Beyond the control it has won over the forces of nature it would now win control over the forces of society of stating the problem and producing the solution, with social machinery to correspond.\\" He proposed liberal education and world vision as a hope for salvation from the mechanistic world, in books such as his Education for the Whole Man (1931) and his 1938 BBC Radio Lectures. In 1922 Jacks hosted Austrian philosopher, Dr Rudolf Steiner, to present a conference at Manchester College on values in education and to share the experiences of the model Waldorf school at Stuttgart.Paull, John (2011) Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference: The Birth of Waldorf Education in Britain. European Journal of Educational Studies, 3 (1): 53‚Äì66. In his article \\"A Demilitarized League of Nations\\", (\\"Hibbert Journal\\", August 1936) Jacks argued the League of Nations should completely eschew military force.Robert Seeley, The Handbook Of Non-Violence; including Aldous Huxley's An Encyclopedia Of Pacifism. Westport, Conn.: L. Hill; Great Neck, N.Y.: Lakeville Press, 1986. (p. 52). Although he continued to preach Unitarianism, he became increasingly critical of all forms of institutional religion and denominationalism, and refused to let his name be added to a list of Unitarian ministers published by the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches in 1928. He accepted an invitation to preach in Liverpool Cathedral in 1933; a Convocation of the Church of England rebuked the cathedral for allowing a Unitarian to preach, igniting a controversy in the press. Jacks published prolifically over a period of fifty years, including philosophical and visionary treatises, biographies, articles, and moral parables. He died in Oxford on 17 February 1955, at the age of 94.

Early life and education Marshall was born in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, the son of Thomas Marshall and Mary n√©e Lucas. He was educated at St Mark's School in Windsor then Southborough School in Tunbridge Wells. He studied at University College, London, and then at the University of Cambridge, graduating from Christ's College, Cambridge in 1900. He did further postgraduate studies at the University of Edinburgh gaining his first doctorate (DSc). Career and research Marshall's first position was a research assistant to James Cossar Ewart in Edinburgh, assisting Ewart's work on the now-discredited theory of telegony. He also began his research on reproduction, studying the reproductive cycle of sheep at Ewart's Penicuik farm; this work resulted in his first significant research paper in 1903. He subsequently studied the oestrus cycle of ferrets (with Edward Sch√§fer) and dogs (with William A. Jolly). He began to study the function of the ovary, publishing a classic paper with Jolly subtitled \\"The ovary as an organ of internal secretion\\" in 1905 that Alan S. Parkes described as \\"the first serious attempt to correlate the changes in the uterus during the reproductive cycle with the cyclic production of different internal secretions by the ovary.\\"Parkes AS (1948). A biographical note prepared by Sir Alan Parkes: F. H. A. Marshall, in Marshall's Physiology of Reproduction: Volume 3 Pregnancy and Lactation (4th edn; G. E. Lamming, ed.), pp. xiv‚Äìxv (Springer; 2013) () From 1903 to 1908 Marshall lectured at the University of Edinburgh in Natural History. Marshall's presence at the University is cited as one of the reasons that the Institute of Animal Genetics was established there in the 1910s. In 1908 he returned to the University of Cambridge, lecturing in the School of Agriculture, and becoming a Reader in 1919. He was a fellow of Christ's College from 1909 until his death. His studies of reproduction were interrupted by the First World War, during which he did research for the Ministries of Food and Agriculture, for example on the optimal age to slaughter cattle. His subsequent research focused on the effect of external factors such as light and climate on reproduction. He also researched courtship and reproduction in birds. Awards and honours In 1901 Marshall was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh; his proposers were James Cossar Ewart, Arthur Masterman, Robert Wallace and Cargill Gilston Knott. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1920. Marshall was appointed a CBE in 1933, the Croonian Lecture in 1936 and, in 1940, the Royal Medal by the Royal Society. The University of Edinburgh gave him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree (LLD) in 1939. Personal life He never married and had no children. He retired in 1943 and died of appendicitis in Cambridge on 5 February 1949.

History B√ºhl is first mentioned in 1261 as Bule. During the 13th century the land and rights over the village were owned by the Counts of Kyburg and the Kyburg Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) families of Sch√ºpfen, Mattstetten and M√∂rigen. It was part of the Herrschaft of Nidau, which was partly acquired by Bern in 1388 and fully acquired in 1393. Under Bernese control B√ºhl was combined with Walperswil to form a community that was known as the Upper County. B√ºhl was also part of the parish of Walperswil.

Releases The film was first released in March 1985, then on DVD in 2002. It then appeared in two DVD collections, Andy Sidaris Collection, Vol. 1 (of six discs) in 2003, and Triple B Collection, Vol. 1 in 2005. Connections to other films The material from the film was reworked from a previous Sidaris film, Stacey (1973). The role of Stacey Hanson (Anne Randall) was divided into two new characters: private detective protagonist Cody Abilene (Darby Hinton) and his girlfriend June Khnockers (Lynda Wiesmeier).Coffman (2012), p. 23-26 The openings of both films depict their respective female race car drivers in the finish of a practice race. Both films then have them getting out of uniform. Stacey is the protagonist, though, while June serves mostly as the source of a recurring joke in her film: \\"Knockers with an \\"h\\"?\\". June can still reliably drive a high-performance race car, but Cody performs most of Stacey's functions in the film.Coffman (2012), p. 23-26 The discreet homosexual nephew John (John Alderman) turns into Stuart (Michael A. Anderson), a drag queen, in the second film. In both films, the detective follows the character into a gay bar. The difference is that in the first film, John wears regular clothes, while in the second, Stuart is in full drag. Cody laughs while dictating notes in a recorder, but still admits that Stuart has great legs. Stuart is more of a cartoonish gay stereotype than John.Coffman (2012), p. 23-26 The youthful niece Pamela (Cristina Raines) turns into the bit older niece Liza (Lorraine Michaels) in the second film. Liza has her own sex scene with the houseboy Shane (Brett Clark). The difference in age was probably decided to allow this sex scene and more nudity than would be acceptable from a teenager.Coffman (2012), p. 23-26 The second film adds a character with no counterpart in the original: Contessa Luciana (Sybil Danning). Contessa has a romantic night with Cody, before he moves into his next assignment. The relationship to the family is unspecified, but she turns out to have murdered Shane. She is beyond the reach of the law and suffers no ill consequences for her murder.Coffman (2012), p. 23-26 See also *Girls with guns References External links * * Malibu Express on NanarLand Category:1980s action films Category:1985 independent films Category:1980s spy films Category:1985 films Category:American action films Category:American films Category:American spy films Category:English- language films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:American independent films Category:Films directed by Andy Sidaris Category:American detective films Category:American auto racing films ","title":"Malibu Express"},{"id":"5682624","text":"Mayura (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§∞ May≈´ra) is a Sanskrit word for peacock which is one of the sacred birds of the Hindu mythology. It is referred to in a number of Hindu scriptures. It is also a contemporary Hindu name used in many parts of India.  Mythology  An Indian Peacock The legend states that the Mayura was created from the feathers of Garuda, another semi-divine mythical birds of Hindu mythology. Garuda is believed to be a vahana (conveyance) of Vishnu, one of the Trimurti. In images of the mayura as a mythical bird, it is depicted as killing a snake, which according to a number of Hindu scriptures, is a symbol of cycle of time.  Significance  Mayura is associated with a number of gods and deities of the Hindus including the following: * A story in the Uttara Ramayana elaborates on Indra, who unable to defeat Ravana, sheltered under the wing of a peacock and later blessed it with a \\"thousand eyes\\" and fearlessness from serpents. Another story has Indra who after being cursed with a thousand ulcers was transformed into a peacock with a thousand eyes. * Kaumari is generally depicted with a mayura and the mayura also serves as her conveyance. * The mayura named Paravani serves as the conveyance of the god Kartikeya. * Krishna is generally depicted with peacock feathers adorning his head. * Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu, is the goddess of prosperity, luck and beauty; she is symbolized by the mayura. * Mayuresvara an incarnation of Ganesha, whose mount is a peacock (in the Ganesha Purana) * The mayura named Citramekhala is associated with Saraswati, a deity representing benevolence, patience, kindness, compassion and knowledge. * Sri Chanda Bhairavar, one of the Ashta Bhairava (\\"Eight Bhairavas\\"); whose mount is a peacock. * Vikata () (\\"unusual form\\", \\"misshapen\\"), an avatar of Ganesha, whose mount is a peacock (in the Mudgala Purana). In general, feathers of mayura are considered sacred and are used to dust the religious images and implements of Hindus. In Asian folklore, especially in that of the Vedda of Sri Lanka the peacock deserves a charm of praise since this bird kills centipedes and snakes.C.G. and C.S.Seligman, \\"The Veddas\\", Oosterhout 1969  See also  * Argus Panoptes * Mahamayuri * Melek Taus  References   Further reading  *Anna Dallapiccola, Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend () Category:Hindu legendary creatures Category:Legendary birds ","title":"Mayura (mythology)"},{"id":"5682632","text":"Fiendish Feet yoghurt pot Fiendish Feet was a brand of low fat dairy yogurts aimed at children, produced by St Ivel in the early 1990s.

He was better known as the commander- in-chief of the army of the West Ukrainian National Republic during the Polish-Ukrainian War and architect of the Chortkiv offensive in which the Ukrainian Galician Army advanced against the Polish army. Background Hrekov was born into a Russian family whose estate was near Glukhov in Sopychi, Chernigov Governorate. Today most of the territory belongs to the village of Sopych, Hlukhiv Raion, on the border with the Russian Federation. His father Petro Havrylovych Hrekov was a lawyer and a large landowner of the Chernigov Governorate and his mother was Maria Hryhorivna Preobrazhenska. According to family legend, the Hrekov's family were descendants of a Greek who was part of the delegation accompanying Sophia Paleologue as she moved to Muscovy in 1472 when marrying Ivan III of Russia, Grand Prince of Moscow. The Hrekov family attained the status of nobility as a reward for their service to Peter the Great.Yaroslav Tinchenko, General Oleksander Hrekiv: Military Actions and Fate Journal of Memorial pg. 4 (Ukrainian) On the insistence of his father, Hrekov completed the law school of Lomonosov Moscow State University in 1897. Later, after surprising enrollment into the Moscow military school, he graduated it in 1899 and the Nicholas General Staff Academy in 1905 after three years of study (along with another Ukrainian general Volodymyr Sinclair). Career in the Russian Army Since 1905 Hrekov served in the Leib-Guard Egersky Regiment. From 1908 taught political and military history at the military academy. Prior to World War I at first (1907) he served at the 3rd Grenadier Division (Moscow) and later (1908) relocated to Saint Petersburg to the 1st Guard Division. There Hrekov received his first award, the Order of Saint Stanislaus of III degree, as well as promotion to captain. Along with his military service the future general was giving lectures in the Pavel Infantry School (uchilishche). Since 1910 Hrekov worked at the headquarters of the Petersburg Military District. In 1910 he also received an assignment of the first adjutant of Guard forces, similar to the chief of Guard intelligence. One of his duties was a close security of the royal family of Nikolai II. In 1911 he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and received his second award, the Order of Saint Anna of III degree. In 1912 Hrekov defended his dissertation on the History of military art, becoming an extraordinary professor which today is a candidate of sciences. Hrekov also became a professor of the Military Art Department at Nikolas Academy General Staff. At the start of the First World War he was appointed as the chief of staff for the 74th Infantry Division which was stationed at the rear. There Hrekov met with another future Ukrainian general Mykola Yunakiv. After a request to send him to the frontlines, Hrekov was appointed as the chief of staff for the 1st Guard Division. In 1915 he was promoted to colonel. In April 1917 he distinguished himself in fighting near Tarnopol and was awarded the Order of St. George of IV degree. The same year Hrekov was promoted to general. Career in the Ukrainian Army In December 1917 he switched to Ukrainian service where his first assignment was the 2nd Serdyuk Division which was only starting to form and at that time consisted out a small officer corps. One of the Hrekov's first remarkable subordinates on the side of the Ukrainian People's Army was a colonel Petro Bolbochan. At one time the Russian prime-minister Vladimir Lenin was offering 50,000 rubles in silver for the head of colonel Bolbochan. During the same time Hrekov was appointed the chief of the Kiev Military District and was partially involved in the formation of the Sich Riflemen Halych-Bukovyna Kurin (Battalion) led by Yevhen Konovalets. The unit became the main supporter of the Central Rada and Mykhailo Hrushevsky. After the fall of Kiev early in 1918 Hrekov retired from the Ukrainian People's Army. From December 1918 until January 1919 he was assigned to undertake negotiations with French forces occupying Odessa on behalf of the Directorate of Ukraine. After a conflict with Petliura and leftist Ukrainian politicians, he was forced to resign his post and on 16 May 1919 assumed command of the Ukrainian Galician Army offered to him by Yevhen Petrushevych. The Galician army faced against the better equipped the Heller's Army was pushed from Lviv all the way to Husyatyn at Zbruch river. Hrekov's presence there electrified the Galician soldiers, who were on the verge of defeat at the hands of the Poles during their war against them; many veterans of that war recalled the period under his command as the high point of their war experience.Yaroslav Tinchenko, General Oleksander Hrekiv: Military Actions and Fate Journal of Memorial pg. 33 (Ukrainian) The officer Kliuchenko, fopr example, recalled that \\"–í–∂–µ —Å–∞–º–∞ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª–∞ –ì—Ä–µ–∫–æ–≤–∞ –≤–∫–∞–∑—É–≤–∞–ª–∞, —â–æ –º–∞—î–º–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ —Å–æ–±–æ—é –≤–æ—è–∫–∞ –∑ –∫—Ä–æ–≤–∏ –π –∫–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –∑ –π–æ–≥–æ –±–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≥–æ –∑–æ—Ä—É –π –≤–∏—Å–æ–∫–æ–≥–æ —á–æ–ª–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–º–æ–≤–ª—è–ª–∞ —ñ–Ω—ñ—Ü—ñ—è—Ç–∏–≤–∞, –±–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∏–π —É–º —Ç–∞ –¥–∞—Ä –±–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–æ—ó –æ—Ä—ñ—î–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü—ñ—ó, –≤ –π–æ–≥–æ –¥—ñ–ª–∞–Ω–Ω—è—Ö –≤–∏—è–≤–ª—è–ª–∞—Å—è –∑–∞–ª—ñ–∑–Ω–∞ —Ä—É–∫–∞. –¶–µ –≤—ñ–¥—á—É–≤–∞–ª–æ—Å—è –º–∏—Ç- —Ç—é –ø–æ –æ–±–Ω—è—Ç—Ç—é –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª–æ–º –ì—Ä–µ–∫–æ–≤–∏–º –∫–µ—Ä—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è –∞—Ä–º—ñ—ó. –ù–µ –∑–≤–∞–∂–∞—é—á–∏ –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–¥–æ- –ª—É–∂–Ω–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –±—É–ª–∞–≤–∏ –ø–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –®—Ç—ñ–ø—à–∏—Ü-–¢–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≤—É, –Ω–∞—á–µ—Ä–∫–Ω—É–≤ –≤—ñ–Ω, –≤–∏–∫–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤—É—é—á–∏ –ø–µ—Ä—à–∏–π —É—Å–ø—ñ—Ö –ø—ñ–¥ –ß–æ—Ä—Ç–∫–æ–≤–∏–º, –≥–ª–∏–±–æ–∫—É –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ü—ñ—é. –ß–∞—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∏ –ª–∞–º–∞–ª–∏ —Ä–∞–∑-–ø–æ-—Ä–∞–∑ –æ–ø—ñ—Ä –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∞, –π—à–ª–∏ –∑ –µ–Ω—Ç—É–∑—ñ—è–∑–º–æ–º –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–±—ñ–π ‚Äî —Ö–æ—á–∞ –±—É–ª–æ –≤ –Ω–∞–±—ñ–π–Ω–∏—Ü—è—Ö —Å—Ç—Ä—ñ–ª–∏–≤–∞ –¥—É–∂–µ –æ–±–º–∞–ª—å, —ñ —Ç–æ —Ä–æ—Å. –Ω–∞–±–æ—ó –¥–æ –∞–≤—Å—Ç—Ä. —Ä—É—à- –Ω–∏—Ü—å! ‚Äî –±–æ –≤—ñ—Ä–∏–ª–∏ –≤ –∑–¥—ñ–±–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—å —ñ –∑–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—è —Å–≤–æ–≥–æ –≤–æ–∂–¥—è.\\" Under Hrekov's command, between 9 June and 5 July the army of the West Ukrainian People's Republic experienced its greatest success during the Chortkiv offensive, when the Poles were thrown back over . Soon, however, the Polish forces were able to recover half of their yielded territory and stabilize the frontlines. As a result, Hrekov became quite popular among the Ukrainians of eastern Galicia. Following a conflict with the leadership of the West Ukrainian National Republic (it is rumored that the head of the West Ukrainian National Republic was pressured by Petliura to let Hrekov go, because Petliura feared Hrekov's popularity and disliked his opposition to Petliura's socialist policies Yaroslav Tinchenko, General Oleksander Hrekiv: Military Actions and Fate Journal of Memorial pg. 34 (Ukrainian)) Hrekov and his family left for Romania in July 1919. Life in Emigration In 1920 he moved to Vienna. While there, he edited the journal \\"Ukraina\\" but adopted a pro-Polish orientation that discredited him in the eyes of much of the Ukrainian √©migr√© community. In the 1930s he became close to a circle of Russian √©migr√©s but at the end of that decade returned to the Ukrainian community, where he tried in vain to create an organization of \\"Ukrainian cossacks.\\" Arrested by the Soviet occupation authorities in 1948 he was taken to Lukyanivska Prison in Kiev, he was exiled to Ozerlag camp of the Gulag before being released in 1956, whereupon he returned to Vienna. Currently a street in Lviv is named after Hrekov. Personal life Oleksander Hrekov married Natalia Ivanivna Kabat in 1905, a daughter of Hofmeister of the Higher Court, secret adviser and senator. His wife's family was of Hungarian descent. They had a son Oleh (1914‚Äì1942) and a daughter Yelyzaveta (1906-?). Hrekov had two sisters Anna and Yulia as well as three brothers: Kostiantyn who became attorney, Hryhoriy - a military officer, and Mykola who was an engineer and railway specialist.

Category:2005 non- fiction books ","title":"New Keywords"},{"id":"5682659","text":"Osees are an American rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1997, now based in Los Angeles, California. The band currently consists of primary songwriter and core member John Dwyer (vocals, guitar), Tim Hellman (bass), Dan Rincon (drums), Paul Quattrone (drums) and Tomas Dolas (keyboards). Osees sound incorporates a wide range of rock genres, including 1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock, punk rock, noise rock, art punk, and 1980s post-punk. Initially an outlet for Dwyer (Coachwhips, Pink and Brown and The Hospitals) to release experimental home recordings, Oh Sees evolved into a full band, featuring Brigid Dawson (vocals, keyboard), Petey Dammit (bass, guitar), Mike Shoun (drums), and Lars Finberg (drums, guitar). Over the course of several releases and genre transitions, the band became noted for their prolific discography, energetic live shows, and whimsical visual aesthetic. The band has changed its lineup and name several times, having previously been known as Orinoka Crash Suite, OCS, Orange County Sound, The Ohsees, The Oh Sees, Thee Oh Sees, and Oh Sees. In late 2013, it was announced that the band would be entering a hiatus. A new studio album, however, entitled Drop, was released in 2014, and Oh Sees subsequently toured as a three-piece, with Sic Alps bassist Tim Hellman and White Fence drummer Nick Murray replacing Dawson, Dammit!, and Shoun. In 2015, Dawson returned to the band, in a studio capacity, for its next studio album, Mutilator Defeated At Last. Following its release, Dwyer and Hellman began touring with two drummers, Ryan Moutinho and Dan Rincon, replacing Murray. Touring extensively, this line-up recorded the band's seventeenth and eighteenth studio albums, A Weird Exits and An Odd Entrances, with Moutinho departing in late 2016 to focus on his own projects. With the arrival of new secondary drummer Paul Quattrone, and an ever-increasing public profile, the band recorded its nineteenth album, Orc, with co-producers Ty Segall, Eric Bauer and Enrique Tena. In late 2017, Dwyer reunited with Dawson for a primarily acoustic album, Memory of a Cut Off Head, which returned to the band's lo-fi roots and featured several former and current Oh Sees members. After two studio albums featuring a heavy, progressive rock sound - Smote Reverser (2018) and Face Stabber (2019) - the band changed its name to Osees in July 2020, with the announcement of their twenty-third album, Protean Threat. History =Early years and solo recordings (1997‚Äì2004)= John Dwyer began using the name Orinoka Crash Suite for songs as early as 1997, appearing on compilations many years before using it for full-length releases. During this period between before the first OCS album, he continued to focus on his primary bands, first with Pink and Brown, and later with Zeigenbock Kopf and Coachwhips. In all three groups, Dwyer was the main vocalist, and in Coachwhips and Pink and Brown, he also played guitar. The first album, simply titled 1, was released in 2003 as the first full album under the OCS name. The first disc was based around acoustic songs, and was individually referred to as 34 Reasons Why Life Goes On Without You. The second disc was a series of \\"noise\\" tracks called 18 Reasons To Love Your Hater To Death. None of the songs on either disc have titles. The album's song credits are mostly attributed to John Dwyer, though three are credited to Jeff Rosenberg, who was the drummer under the pseudonym \\"Brown\\" in Pink and Brown. The album features several guest musicians, but no one who would continue on to the next album, entitled 2. 2 was released in 2004, and was made in a similar fashion to 1, but with a greater focus on Dwyer as a solo performer. =First transitional period and lineup changes (2005‚Äì2007)= The band slowly transitioned from being Dwyer's side project into his primary group, as his other bands Coachwhips and Zeigenbock Kopf both disbanded during this period (2005 and 2006, respectively). OCS became a two-piece with the addition of Patrick Mullins who played percussion and saw. The arrangements continued to be simple, though bolstered by the addition of Mullins. The project's third and fourth studio albums, Songs About Death & Dying Vol. 3 and OCS 4: Get Stoved were released as a two-CD set in 2005. 3 was available both as part of this set, and as an individual vinyl release. 4 did not see a vinyl issue until 2008. Brigid Dawson was previously a member of the duo Mix Tape with Meric Long of The Dodos. She had been working in a coffee shop in San Francisco, and would frequently see Dwyer visit the shop and put up flyers for his upcoming shows. The two became fast friends, and Dwyer eventually asked Dawson to join the band after seeing one of her shows. Her role includes duet/backing vocals, keyboards, and tambourine. Dawson will occasionally perform lead vocals (in the cases of \\"Invitation\\" on Sucks Blood and \\"What Are We Craving?\\" on Castlemania). As a trio, the band released The Cool Death of Island Raiders in 2006, their first release under the name The OhSees. The album was co-produced by TV on the Radio members Dave Sitek and Kyp Malone. Petey Dammit! joined the group in 2007, as a bassist and occasionally second guitarist. Dammit was previously a member of the two-piece band Tres Ferocious. John Dwyer was familiar with the band's work, and asked him to join when he was looking to expand the lineup of The Ohsees. Dammit's bass playing uncharacteristically involves using an ordinary electric guitar that is fed through an electronic device that makes it sound like a bass guitar. His method of doing this is intentionally kept a secret. Dammit typically favors Fender Jazzmaster guitars for this task, but in Thee Hounds of Foggy Notion, he is also seen using a blue Italia Mondial without this manipulation, for songs that were not recorded with a bass guitar. The album Sucks Blood followed in 2007. It would be the final studio album to feature Patrick Mullins, but he would appear later in the live DVD/album Thee Hounds Of Foggy Notion that was released in 2008. Mullins moved to Louisville, Kentucky and in 2010 he released a solo album called Don't Go To Sleep. Jigmae Baer played for a year as the group's drummer after Mullins had left the band. He recorded with the band for their Tascam 388 recordings, as well as their sessions with Dave Sitek. His work can be heard on Sucks Blood, The Master's Bedroom is Worth Spending a Night In, and various 7\\" and 10\\"s releases during this period. Baer went on to play with Ty Segall in both his solo act and in The Perverts. Baer then founded the Royal Baths and currently is a founding member of LODRO. Mike Shoun joined the band as the new drummer after Baer's departure. Shoun's arrival coincided with the band's change into a louder garage punk based sound. =Garage, psychedelia, and punk (2008‚Äì2013)= With the new four-piece lineup established, the scope of the band's music and success started to increase. The Master's Bedroom is Worth Spending a Night In was released in 2008, under the name Thee Oh Sees. This album is also notable for being the first collaboration with Chris Woodhouse, a mix engineer and guest musician who would continue to appear on the albums that followed. The band released their album Help in 2009. This was their first album released on In the Red Records, the label for most of their main releases up until 2013. The album, Dog Poison, was also released this year, an acoustic take on the newer, more upbeat sound of the band. Warm Slime arrived in 2010, following strongly in the footsteps of Help. The album's first side is dominated by the title track, their longest song to date, with a running time of 13:30. The song's long format and repetitive structure foreshadowed the krautrock influence that would become a larger part of their sound in the new decade. On April 28, 2011, Patrick Mullins rejoined the band for a one-off performance at the Cafe Du Nord in their hometown of San Francisco. The band played songs from the albums 4 through The Master's Bedroom is Worth Spending a Night In. Most of these songs had not been included in the setlists for some time. The recording of 2011's Castlemania was solely undertaken by John Dwyer and Brigid Dawson and a series of other notable musicians. Petey Dammit and Mike Shoun would record on the year's latter album Carrion Crawler/The Dream along with new member Lars Finberg (from The Intelligence). Finberg joined as a full-time second drummer and second guitar player, but continues to lead and tour with The Intelligence. Dawson and Dwyer approached 2012's Putrifiers II in a similar manner as the group recorded Castlemania. In 2011, the band's single \\"Tidal Wave\\" was featured in the Breaking Bad episode \\"Salud\\", where it plays over Gus Fring's poisoning of Don Eladio and his capos. In 2013, \\"The Dream\\", from Carrion Crawler/The Dream was included in the soundtrack for the video game Grand Theft Auto V. On April 16, 2013, The band released Floating Coffin. The album was released on Castle Face Records, a label that John Dwyer co-owns with Brian Lee Hughes and Matt Jones. The album was the first since The Master's Bedroom ... to be self-released. Later that year, they released the Moon Sick EP, a collection of four songs from the Floating Coffin sessions that were excluded from the album. The EP was released as a benefit for Healthy San Francisco, a healthcare organization that had aided Dwyer and his friends over the years. =Second transitional period (2013‚Äì2015)= On December 18, 2013 during a show at San Francisco's Great American Music Hall, Dwyer announced to the crowd \\"This will be the last Oh Sees show for a long while. So dig in.\\" In an interview with SF Weekly, the band's tour manager Annie Southworth confirmed the news, noting that Dwyer was looking to take some time off as he made the move from San Francisco to Los Angeles. She added, \\"They need a break after 5 years straight, so yes ... hiatus time. Will be a little hard to continue with all the different locales so who knows what is going to happen ... Cross fingers, we all are that it's not completely over.\\" The statements led to rumors that the band was entering an indefinite hiatus, or breaking up. On December 20, 2013, the band cleared the rumors by posting on their official site that a new LP will be coming in early 2014, and \\"we will see where the live shows go from there.\\" On February 12, it was announced that the album, entitled Drop, would be released on April 19 through Castle Face Records. It was created by John Dwyer and Chris Woodhouse, similar to the creation of previous Thee Oh Sees albums like Putrifiers II, Dog Poison, and Castlemania. Brigid Dawson relocated to San Marin, CA, where she continues to paint and exhibit artwork. Mike Shoun & Petey Dammit have remained in the Bay Area. Dammit appeared as the bassist on Dylan Shearer's Empty Cellar Records/Castle Face release garagearray, released on April 15, 2014. In 2014, Dammit joined former member Lars Finberg's band, The Intelligence. Since the dispersal of the band members, the band's live performances have been as a trio, with drummer Nick Murray, and bassist Timothy Hellman. Brigid Dawson's roles as a vocalist and keyboardist have not been filled. John Dwyer explained the reason for the latter in an interview with Uncut magazine: \\"The future of the band doesn't hold much keyboard, I want to go more guitar. I'll still record with a keyboard but I'm burned out with it live. I've been getting trapped into synthesizer land, I'm just surrounded by drum machines and keyboards while all my rock and roll stuff is in another studio.\\" Brooklyn Vegan noted that while the band is currently touring as a trio, this should not be considered a permanent, \\"official\\" lineup change. In 2015, however, the new line-up of the band entered the studio to record its fourteenth studio album, Mutilator Defeated At Last, with Brigid Dawson returning to the band as its backing vocalist. Following the album's release, drummers Ryan Moutinho and Dan Rincon joined both Dwyer and Hellman in the band's live line-up. In 2019, the album came at no.23 on Happy Mag's \\"25 Best Psychedelic Rock Albums of The 2010s\\" with high praise of the albums \\"textured density.\\" In February 2016, the band released a stand-alone single from the album's sessions, entitled \\"Fortress\\", and announced a live album, Live in San Francisco, from its accompanying tour, which was released on July 1, 2016. =Name change and prolific output (2016‚Äì2019)= With the core line-up solidifying into the four-piece of Dwyer, Hellman, Moutinho and Rincon, the band toured extensively, releasing a new single, \\"Plastic Plant\\", alongside an announcement that they'd be releasing a new album entitled A Weird Exits on August 12 of that year. A second album recorded during the same sessions, An Odd Entrances, was released on November 18, 2016. Two days prior to its release, Ryan Moutinho departed from the band, stating: \\"I'm not here to list reasons as they are personal and the list would be far too long. ... Thank you for coming to the shows and giving every ounce of energy to us. I promise I tried my very best to give it back in return. I don't see this as closing old doors but opening new ones.\\" In January 2017, drummer Paul Quattrone (!!!, Modey Lemon) joined the band onstage for two benefit shows at the Teragram Ballroom, Los Angeles. On June 7, 2017, Dwyer announced the name of the band has changed to Oh Sees and released a track entitled \\"The Static God\\" from their upcoming record Orc, which was released on August 25, 2017. Three days after Orcs release, Dwyer announced that the title of the band had yet again changed back to the original moniker of OCS, and released the track \\"Memory of a Cut Off Head\\" from the similarly titled album, due out November 17, as the 100th record on Castle Face. The band made it clear that this was a one time name for this album only, and returned to the lineup of Dwyer and Dawson, as well as returning to their original hushed sound. On December 28, 2017, the band announced the return to the name Oh Sees along with a new EP, Dead Medic, consisting of two long tracks from the Orc sessions, including a cover of \\"A Few Days of Reflection\\" by the Swedish Band Tr√§d, Gr√§s, och Stenar The band released a track entitled \\"Overthrown\\" on May 21, 2018, from their record Smote Reverser, which was released on August 17, 2018. In addition, the band announced an expansion to their on-going tour. The band released a 21-minute track titled \\"Henchlock\\" on June 25, 2019, from their record Face Stabber, which was released on August 16, 2019. =Osees (2019‚Äìpresent)= On November 23, 2019, the band released The 12\\" Synth including two 20-minute tracks on the YouTube channel of Castleface Records, under the name of \\"Osees\\".

Azc√°rate y Ledesma, born in Mexico City, was a Criollo and a lawyer for rich clients. Shortly after obtaining his license to practice law, he became a lawyer at the Academia Te√≥rico-Pr√°ctica de Jurisprudencia, and later its vice-president. In 1808, he became a regidor (councilman) in the city government of Mexico City. News of the French occupation of Spain was received in Mexico on June 23, 1808, and the following July 14, news of the abdication of the Spanish king in favor of Napoleon was also received. On July 19, 1808, Azc√°rate, along with councilman Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos presented a plan to form a provisional, autonomous government of New Spain, with the current viceroy, Jos√© de Iturrigaray, at its head. The justification for this was that the mother country was now occupied by foreign troops, and the royal family was being held prisoner. The plan was accepted by the viceroy and the Cabildo (city council), but not by the Audiencia. It was also vehemently opposed by the Peninsulares (Spaniards resident in New Spain, but born in the mother country). Viceroy Iturrigaray was overthrown in a coup on September 15, 1808 for his sympathy for the independence movement. He was replaced by Pedro de Garibay. Among the first acts of Garibay's administration was the issuance of arrest warrants for leaders in the independence movement -- Azc√°rate y Ledesma, Primo de Verdad y Ramos, Jos√© Beye Cisneros, the abbot of Guadalupe, Canon Berist√°in, Licenciado Cristo, Iturrigaray's secretary, and Fray Melchor de Talamantes. Azc√°rate remained in prison until 1811, when he was freed. In 1821, he was among the signers of the Acta de Independencia of Mexico. On the fall of Emperor Agust√≠n de Iturbide, he served successive Mexican administrations, as a minister in the Supreme War Tribunal, as a member of the Mexico City government, and as secretary of the Hospital of the Poor. In addition, he wrote poetry and prose, including: *Poema heroica en celebridad de la colocaci√≥n de la estatua ecuestre colosal de bronce del se√±or don Carlos IV (1804) *Oda y soneto en el certamen po√©tico formado con motivo de la colocaci√≥n de la estatua ecuestre del se√±or don Carlos IV (1814) *Breves apuntamientos para la literature del renio de Nueva Espa√±a y Ensayos paneg√≠rico e hist√≥rico del m√©rito de los principales sujetos, as√≠ naturales como europeos, que han sobresalido en el reino The first two of these are poetical works inspired by the dedication of the equestrian statue of Charles IV by Manuel Tols√° in Mexico City in 1803.

It is bounded by other communes, Castel Gandolfo, Albano Laziale, Rocca di Papa, Grottaferrata, and Ciampino.Ciampino was a frazione of Marino up to December 1974. Marino is famous for its white wine, and for its Grape Festival, which has been celebrated since 1924. History View of the city. The territory of Marino was inhabited by Latin tribes from the 1st millennium BC. The ancient cities of Bovillae (Frattocchie), Mugilla (Santa Maria delle Mole, a frazione of the comune of Marino) and Ferentum (Marino itself) were part of the Latin League. Under the Roman Republic it was a summer resort for Roman patricians, who built luxurious villas in the area to escape the heat of Rome. In 846 AD, Bovillae - until then the largest settlement - was destroyed by the Saracens, and the population moved to the more easily defendable area of Ferentum, which was fortified under the new name of Marinum. From 1090 it was a dominium of the Counts of Tusculum, and later a fief of the Frangipane and, beginning in 1266, the Orsini. In 1272, San Bonaventura founded the first confraternity of Italy there. In 1347 it was besieged in vain by Cola di Rienzo. Fifty years later, it was the site of the battle between Alberico da Barbiano and the French troops supporting Antipope Clement VII. In 1419 it was bought by the Colonna, who maintained it until 1914. Marino hosted famous historical figures, from Charles VIII of France to Alfonso II d'Este and many others. Vittoria Colonna was born in Marino in 1492 and lived there for part of her life. In 1571, Marino's people welcomed Marcantonio Colonna, a protagonist of the Battle of Lepanto, with a triumph, remembered yearly by a festival. It became part of Italy in 1870. On 14 March 1880 the railway Rome- Ciampino-Marino was opened for service. On 1 April 1906 an electric tram line replaced the former. In 1954 the electric tram line was replaced by buses. On 2 February 1944, during World War II, Marino was heavily bombed by USAAF B-25 aircraft from the US XII Air Force. In 1974, Ciampino became a separate comune. In the Due Santi district, there is the Roman campus of the University of Dallas, which opened in 1994 and is used by its students for its summer programs.

He was president of the Bank of Montreal, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. He was Governor of McGill University and on the board of the Canadian Pacific Railway. His home in Montreal's Golden Square Mile was made a National Historic Site of Canada in 1990 and is today part of McGill University, named Lady Meredith House for his wife. Family (Henry) Vincent Meredith was born in London, Ontario, the fifth son of John Walsingham Cooke Meredith and Sarah Pegler. One of his great uncles, Boyle Meredith (1788‚Äì1873), married Eliza Gough Vincent (1797‚Äì1870), a niece of General John Vincent and a cousin of Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough. It was after her family that he was given his middle name, which he chose to use as his first. He was one of a group of brothers collectively referred to as 'The Eight London Merediths'. They included Sir William Ralph Meredith, Chief Justice Richard Martin Meredith, Thomas Graves Meredith and Charles Meredith. The Eight London Merediths were close to their cousins Judge Richard Edmund Meredith, Frederick Edmund Meredith, William Archer Redmond and Judge James Creed Meredith. Bank of Montreal After an initial education at \\"a home rich in cultural elements\\",Dictionary of Canadian Biography, 1921-1930 he briefly attended the Hellmuth Boys College at London, Ontario, before joining the Bank of Montreal as a clerk in 1867. He steadily rose through the ranks to become the first Canadian-born president of the bank from 1913 to 1927. From his retirement until his death two years later, he served as chairman of the board. In Meredith's time, before the creation of the Bank of Canada in 1934, the Bank of Montreal acted as Canada's national bank, and Meredith successfully guided the nation's economy through the First World War. When Meredith was elected president in 1913, the bank had assets worth $244 million, which had tripled to $831 million when he resigned his presidency in 1927. Along with his cousins ‚Äì the brothers William Henry Meredith (1849‚Äì1895) and Frederick Edmund Meredith ‚Äì he was one of three Merediths to have attained high position within the bank. As president, Sir Vincent's office was at the bank's headquarters at 119 St. James Street in Montreal, Quebec. When he retired as president of the bank in 1927, The Banker, published in London, England, summed up the effect he had had on Canadian financial affairs during his time at the bank, Among many other positions, Vincent Meredith was a member of the Montreal Board of Trade, a member of the Board of Directors of Canadian Pacific Railway; the Royal Exchange Assurance Co., of London, England; the Royal Trust Assurance Co., of Montreal (also serving as that company's president for a time); the Standard Life Assurance Company of Edinburgh and Dominion Textile. He served as Governor of McGill University, president of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, and president of the Royal Victoria Hospital. He was created a hereditary Baronet of the United Kingdom by King George V for his wartime services to Canada and the British Empire in 1916. Lady Meredith Ardvarna in Montreal In 1888, Vincent Meredith married (Isabella) Brenda Allan (1867‚Äì1959), the youngest daughter of Andrew Allan, who had then succeeded his elder brother, Sir Hugh Allan, as president of the Allan Line and the Merchant's Bank etc. This marriage brought Meredith additional wealth and powerful connections. As a wedding gift, his father-in-law gave him and his wife a parcel of land on the corner of Pine Avenue and Peel Street in the Golden Square Mile, just across from Ravenscrag, where Lady Meredith's cousin, Sir Montagu Allan, lived. In 1894, they employed the architect Edward Maxwell to build them a house there, \\"Ardvarna\\", a turreted, red brick mansion, now known as Lady Meredith House. Maxwell had also previously designed their summer house at Mont Saint-Bruno, Quebec. Lady Meredith House was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1990. Following the First World War, when wounded Canadian soldiers started to return from the Front in 1918, Lady Meredith set up a rehabilitation centre for officers at her and Vincent's Montreal home. During their 1939 Royal Tour of Canada, Lady Meredith was the hostess to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother during their stay in Montreal, Quebec. In 1942, Lady Meredith donated the house to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal as a residence for the nurses. Brenda Meredith donated the Lady Meredith Cup for the Quebec Ladies' Hockey Association in 1920, the first ice hockey trophy in Canada to be competed for between women in ankle-length skirts.On the Edge: Women Making Hockey History (1996) Elizabeth Etue & Megan Williams On the 100th anniversary of the Montreal Thistle Curling Club in 1943, the Montreal Gazette of the day reported that on Christmas Eve, 1870, she was \\"probably the first lady in Canada to put up an iron\\". She served as president of the Purple Cross (a service for the care of wounded and disabled horses on the battlefield during World War I); president of the Canadian Women's Army Auxiliary Corps; Governor of the Royal Victoria's Maternity Hospital; director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; vice president of the Women's National Immigration Society, and honorary patroness of the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire with Lady Eug√®ne Fiset and Lady H. Montagu Allan. She was a member and benefactor of the Presbyterian Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul, Montreal, and was one of the founders of the Montreal Ladies Golf Club. They left no children, but along with Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, Vincent Meredith was the godfather to Robert Henry Arthur Rivers-Bulkeley (1914‚Äì2007), son of Colonel Charles Rivers-Bulkeley and Annie Evelyn Pelly. Lady Meredith was the godmother of Frederick Edmund Meredith's only grandson, and the only son of her first cousin, Sir Montagu Allan. Philanthropy Sir Vincent Meredith was a generous philanthropist. A founding member of the Canadian Mental Health Association he served on its board of directors and was one of its chief benefactors. In 1909 he gave the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal (where he solely sponsored an annual ball for the nurses) an automobile, Canada's first motor ambulance, but as with all his gifts and donations, refused to allow anything of it to be mentioned in the papers. It was also his idea to bring the famous neuro-surgeon Wilder Penfield to the Royal Victoria Hospital. At the Bank of Montreal he introduced the 'Sir Vincent Meredith Fund', which was set up for the female employees of the bank to relieve them in a financial crisis, which is still in operation today. In his will he left just under six hundred thousand dollars to be shared between the Royal Victoria Hospital, McGill University and Bishop's University, Lennoxville. It was said that Sir Vincent took every opportunity to relieve suffering in Montreal and advance that city. As well as giving financial backing and donations from his own art collection to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, he also donated a set of four Louis Comfort Tiffany windows to the museum's new building. In sports, he donated the 'Sir Vincent Meredith Trophy' awarded to the best all-round athlete of the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association, as well as giving the Meredith Cup for the Waltzing Competition held at the Winter Club, and the Meredith Trophy awarded at the Dominion Drama Festival. Private life Meredith's funeral monument in Mount Royal Cemetery. The Merediths shared a passion for horses, and were said to have had a fine eye for them. Vincent rode with the Montreal Hunt, played polo in Senneville, Quebec, and they both imported many fine horses from Ireland and England. His youngest brother, Llewellyn Meredith (1860‚Äì1933) J.P., was a highly respected judge at the Olympia, London Horse Show in England, and also bred his own horses at his farm outside London, Ontario. Sir Vincent was also a keen fisherman. Both he and Lady Meredith had a great interest in music and art and were one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Grand Opera in Montreal, Quebec. He belonged to many clubs in Montreal and England, and he was amongst the founding members of the Mount Royal Club in Montreal, the Ritz-Carlton Montreal Hotel and the Montreal Winter Club. The Montreal Gazette said of him : Sir Vincent Meredith died in 1929 without children, and thus his short-lived baronetcy became extinct. His wife continued to live in their Montreal home until 1941, when she gave it to the Royal Victoria Hospital to use as a nurses residence. McGill University acquired the use of the property in 1975, and today it is known as Lady Meredith House, home to the McGill Centre for Medicine, Ethics, and Law. Meredith and his wife are buried in a plot reserved for the Meredith family at Mount Royal Cemetery. Buried there also is one of his younger brothers, Charles Meredith, with his wife, a daughter of Richard B. Angus, and his cousin, a close friend of both of the brothers, Frederick Edmund Meredith. This generation of his family in Canada, and Ireland, was a remarkably distinguished group.

From early 1991 until late 2001 they released records on international record labels and toured Europe and the USA. History =Origins and early years= In the late 1980s, vocalist Ian Leck and guitarist Sean Readman were members of Durham straight edge hardcore band Steadfast. In 1990, while still in Steadfast, Leck began a brief side project, heavily inspired by Judge with bassist Buzzard, who had recently been released from prison for grievous bodily harm, drummer Gary Cousins and guitarist Darrell Hindley, who both played in another Durham straight edge hardcore band called False Face. Buzzard departed from the band a few weeks after formation, leading to hiring of David \\"Brownie\\" Brown. By the time Steadfast and False Face had broken up in 1991, the four members decided to regroup with the addition of Steadfast guitarist Sean Readman, who had a single rehearsal with Know Your Enemy material, before deciding to distance themselves from those songs and pursue a faster Boston hardcore-inspired sound under a different name. Taking on the name Voorhees, in reference to Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th franchise, the band played their first performance in September 1991 at the Durham Rowing Club in support of punk band Sour Face. Soon after, the recorded their debut demo Everyone's Good at Something... Except Us! in Hartlepool. The demo was recorded for free by Leck, as a part of his college music engineering course. Soon after, they won two free days recording time at Consett's North Studios, but Brown left the group a few days beforehand, leading to Readman performing bass on the recordings. By the time they began performing again, they had hired former-Steadfast bassist Paul Rugman-Jones to take over for Brown. This recording was released as the Violent EP in April 1993 through Armed with Anger records. The band then opened for Slapshot on their UK headline tour, and recorded two Negative Approach covers for a tribute compilation. Hindley and Cousins left the group around this time, leading to the band recruiting Sour Face drummer Michael Gillham and new guitarist Graeme Nicholls. =1994‚Äì1998: Spilling Blood Without Reason and Fireproof EP= The band recorded their debut album Spilling Blood Without Reason at Studio 64 in Middlesbrough with producer Matthew Burke. They had originally written sixteen tracks for the album, but because their name was based on Friday the 13th, they decided to write an additional ten tracks so that each side of vinyl could consist of thirteen tracks. In August 1994, headlined a European tour, intended to be supported by Finnish band Selfish, but when Selfish dropped out Force Macabra were booked to replace them. The tour was planned to last for three and a half weeks, but due to Force Macabra also dropping out, it only lasted two. Voorhees recorded a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1 at Maida Vale studios in London in March 1995, which was first broadcast the following month. The session was then re-recorded for a split EP with Stalingrad. At the beginning of 1996, they had their first US headline tour, supported by Hatebreed. After this tour, Readman and Gillham left the band causing the hiring Richard Armitage on guitar and Gareth Pugh on drums. A few days later, Nicholls announced he was moving to San Francisco and could no longer be a part of the band, being replaced by James Atkinson, a local skater. This line- up was set to make its live debut on their 1996 European headline tour, but it was cancelled shortly before it was intended to take place, and instead first performed publicly in Bristol, supported by Stalingrad. Pugh was soon replaced by Local Student Chris, who performed with the band opening for Sick of it All in Bradford and then Agnostic Front in London before being forced to take part in military service in Greece. This meant that Gillham returned to the band for a short period, when they headlined their second US tour with support from Dropdead, Charles Bronson, Devoid of Faith and Kill Your Idols. During this period they recorded the Fireproof EP at Technical Ecstasy studios in New Jersey. After the tour, David Allen became their new drummer and Rugman-Jones left the band to become an environmental biologist after the tour, leading to ban hiring new bassist Andrew Wright. =1999‚Äì2001: 13th and Crystal Lake's Legacy= From August 1998 and April 1999, the band recorded their second album at Lowfold Studios in Lancaster, which would be released under the name 13th through Armed with Anger and Six Weeks records. Wright was asked to leave the band soon after due to his addiction to heroin, with his role briefing being filled by Atkinson, before hiring Steve Stewart. This line-up toured the US with Kill Your Idols, the Nerve Agents and the Explosion in 1999, and then took part in a European tour. They then recorded their third album Crystal Lake's Legacy, which was released in 2001, before breaking up. =2004‚Äìpresent: Reunions= In October 2004, the 'Spilling Blood Without Reason' line-up of Voorhees got together for a one-off show, \\"Night of the Living Dead at Sea\\", which was played on a ferry boat on the Mersey River in Liverpool. On 23 and 24 April 2010, Voorhees re-banded to do shows in Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Leeds(UK). These gigs were meant to be with the classic 'Spilling Blood' line-up, but the volcano ash cloud which grounded all flights to and from Europe the week previous meant Graeme and Paul could not make it as they got stuck in the US Sam Layzell filled in for both shows. He also played in Leeds bands such as Closure, Bonestorm and SickFuckinO with Ian Leck. Ian Leck and Sam Layzell have gone on to provide vocals and bass respectively for Rot in Hell alongside fellow Voorhees guitarist James Atkinson. On Sunday 13 May 2012 Voorhees played an impromptu set at Morrowfest in Nottingham as a tribute to their friend John Paul Morrow who died 10 years ago. This prompted them to reform with a pick and mix line up from all the previous incarnations of the band, they played with Negative Approach in Manchester on Tuesday 16 October 2012, followed by '20 years of Violent' at Bradford 1 in 12 club 23 March 2013, 'Slow End Fest' in Eindhoven 8 June 2013, with Sick of it all (20 years since the first time they played together) in Manchester 28 August, with Indecision in London (Underworld, Camden) on 25 October 2013 and in October 2014 Voorhees returned to Eindhoven for Bloodshed Fest. Musical style Voorhees play the genre hardcore punk, influenced by SSD, Negative Approach and Negative FX. Maximumrocknroll described their music as \\"harkening back to the days of hardcore bands having something that drove them, the kind of anger and frustration that drives some people out of the room and has others turning it up louder\\". Kerrang! described the band's sound as a \\"blistering\\" cross between \\"Discharge and Extreme Noise Terror\\". In his book Armed with Anger, Ian Glasper described them as \\"ultra raw - Boston hardcore workship... like a bloody machete through buttered brains\\", and in Trapped in a Scene he described their sound as a \\"bad-tempered take on brutal old school hardcore\\".

It has its own showground - the Shropshire Agricultural Showground, which lies on the north bank of the River Severn in a rural setting (though it is less than a mile from Shrewsbury town centre). The showground is accessed via Berwick Road, the B5067. The show is held usually in May and has attracted as many as 40,000 people, from across the region. On 7 November 2009 the Shropshire and West Midlands Agricultural Society, which ran the show, ran into financial difficulties, all staff were made redundant with immediate effect. In early 2010 a Company Voluntary Agreement was negotiated. By the end of 2014 the debts had been reduced by two thirds and the trustees were therefore able to start investing in the infrastructure of the showground. With the support of newly appointed sponsors Greenhous, a local car dealership and servicing company, there is a renewed confidence that the showground will continue. The society is now run by trustees with a recently appointed full- time Showground Director. Aside from the highly successful show in 2012, there are events at the Showground on most weekends, including a new separate Horse Show, The mid-Shropshire Vintage Club Show, November Bonfire, and The Shrewsbury Folk Festival.

His most recent position was the lead commentator for NBC Sports on coverage of the IndyCar Series. He retired from broadcasting after the 2012 IndyCar season finale to care for his wife Pam who was battling brain cancer. After his wife's death that offseason, it was announced by Indycar and NBC officials that he would come out of retirement for Indianapolis 500 final practice coverage in 2013, and would be available in a reserve role. Announcing career =Prior ABC/ESPN= Bob Jenkins was born in Richmond, Indiana, and grew up in the nearby town of Liberty. He graduated from Short High School in 1965 and Indiana University in 1969. He was co-anchor for nationally syndicated farm news show, \\"AgDay\\". =ESPN and ABC= He was one of the original cornerstone anchors on ESPN when it debuted in 1979, working there as one of the most senior members of the network until 2003. Despite his status, he rarely, if ever, visited the Bristol, Connecticut studios. Nearly all of his work with the network was at the track, or at satellite studios in Indianapolis or Charlotte. His primary duty was anchoring NASCAR on ESPN from 1979 to 2000. His first booth partner was Larry Nuber. Later, he was teamed with Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons. The trio was one of the most popular announcing crews in NASCAR. By the early 1990s, the crew (sans Jarrett, who was contracted with CBS) would also cover races on ABC Sports. During the 1980s, Jenkins also occasionally called CART races on ESPN, prior to the arrival of veteran Paul Page. Jenkins hosted the weekly racing magazine show SpeedWeek during most of his tenure at ESPN. Jenkins was the television announcer of the Brickyard 400 on ABC from 1994 to 2000. Concurrent to his work on ESPN & ABC, from 1979 to 1998, Jenkins worked on the IMS Radio Network. He reported various positions, including the backstretch, turn four, and served as chief announcer of the Indy 500 from 1990 to 1998. By 1999, Jenkins quit the radio crew to focus on television full-time. The ongoing IRL/CART split forced changes in the announcing crews at ESPN/ABC. In addition, ESPN/ABC would be losing NASCAR rights at the end of the season. Paul Page was assigned to the CART series broadcasts, and Jenkins was moved exclusively to the chief announcing position of the IRL and Indianapolis 500 broadcasts. The arrangement would continue through 2001. For 2002, with CART floundering, Page was moved back to the IRL, and Jenkins was shifted to the lesser host position. The arrangement created a \\"crowded\\" booth with two veteran announcers. In 2003, on Bump Day at the Indy 500 on ESPN, Jenkins made an impassioned commentary, defending the event from media detractors. Many were ridiculing the race and the IRL for struggling to fill the field to the traditional 33 cars. At the end of the 2003 season, Jenkins was released from ABC/ESPN. =Post ABC/ESPN= After being released from ABC/ESPN in 2003, Jenkins joined the Indianapolis Motor Speedway staff in various roles including public address announcer and designated emcee of various events and press gatherings (such as the Victory Banquet, Last Row Party, and press conferences). The 2003 Brickyard 400 was his first foray as part of the P.A. team. In 2004, he had a short stint as an announcer for Champ Car on Spike TV but was soon fired by the production company. He joined SPEED and was an anchor for Speed News for a little over one year. Jenkins has also been a contributor to WIBC radio in Indianapolis. In June 2006, Jenkins was released from his contract with SPEED. According to Jayski's Silly Season Site, in early 2006 Jenkins became the communications director for the Premier Racing Association. In July 2006, he was the chief announcer of the IMS Radio Network for the U.S. Grand Prix. In 2007, he was the announcer of Indy Pro Series broadcasts on ESPN2. He anchored the Allstate 400 on the radio, his first NASCAR race call since November 2000. For 2007-08, he returned to the IMS Radio Network for the Indy 500, reporting from the turn two position. In 2008, Jenkins returned to the ESPN booth for two IndyCar races, the Rexall Edmonton Indy and the Nikon Indy 300 in Surfers Paradise. Regular play-by-play announcer Marty Reid was unable to broadcast because of prior engagements. =NBC= In 2009, the IndyCar Series started a new television contract with Versus. Jenkins was signed as the chief announcer, and returned to Indy racing full-time for the first time since 2001. He opted out of reprising his turn two role on the radio network, because Versus was hosting a post-race show, and Jenkins would not have time to arrive at the studio in time. Jenkins, however, recorded segments for air on the radio broadcast, as all three living \\"Voices of the 500\\" (Page, Jenkins, and King) participated in the broadcast. Jenkins worked for Versus in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, Versus was bought by NBC Sports Group, becoming NBCSN. NBC inherited the IndyCar rights and hired Jenkins to continue as lead announcer for IndyCar on NBC. During the month of May, and on race day at the Indianapolis 500 (which ESPN/ABC still has the rights to), he continued his part-time work on the public address announcing team, a gig that continues for the Kroger Super Weekend at the Brickyard and the Red Bull Indianapolis Grand Prix. Jenkins was involved in NBCSN's wraparound coverage of the week of the 500. He announced on 2012 Indianapolis 500 Carb Day airing on May 25, 2012, that he would retire from broadcasting after the IZOD INDYCAR World Championships in Fontana, California, in September. Jenkins announced the retirement as a result of his wife Pam, who had terminal brain cancer and died shortly after the season ended. For 2013, he worked in public address system at both the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the United States Auto Club's Silver Crown Series, Jenkins also returned to NBC in a reserve role at the Indianapolis 500 during Carburetion Day coverage and race day coverage, including final practice, the pit stop contest, and the Firestone Freedom 100. This will be as a substitute for Leigh Diffey, his successor on IndyCar telecasts, who is unavailable that weekend. Jenkins will be available in a reserve role should Diffey be unavailable for other races, alongside Rick Allen, the current lead broadcaster for NBC's NASCAR coverage. Jenkins, still at the Speedway for the public address system, has also narrated some vignettes for NBC's NASCAR coverage on both weekday programs and race weekends. For the 2019 Indianapolis 500, Jenkins and Dan Wheldon will be inducted into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum's Hall of Fame.

In order to be realistic, the race announcers in the movie Days of Thunder were the actual ESPN crew of the time, which meant Jenkins was the announcer in several voice- over scenes. While at Speed Channel in 2005, he was the Speed anchor in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. He also did voice over work in the movie Kart Racer. His voice was used in the EA Sports NASCAR video game series, from NASCAR 98 to NASCAR 2001, the Codemasters video game IndyCar Series and IndyCar Series 2005 as well as the Destineer video game Indianapolis 500 Evolution. He also appeared the video game Andretti Racing on the PS1. His most recent work can be heard in the trailer for the independent film Trifocals (March, 2007). Personal life Jenkins is a colon cancer survivor and resides in the Indianapolis area. His wife Pam died from complications of brain cancer in Carmel, Indiana on October 25, 2012.

Variants There are many variants of this tale. In some versions of the tale the she-mouse is seduced by the answer of the cat, who sweetly meows when asked what he will do at night. In this version the she-mouse marries the cat and she is usually eaten by the cat at the wedding night, though not always. Other variants have a third part in which the he-mouse falls into a broth and dies, and even there is a fourth part, in which all the friends of the she-mouse harm themselves somehow describing their actions with a jingle, because they feel sorry for her. Each of these characters increase the seriousness of their self-destructive actions, singing a different jingle, but with parallelisms with the previous one. The main character of the story can also have different representations such as a little ant or a little cockroach. Origin This tale seems to have been originated in the oral tradition and later moved to a literary form. Again, its literary form may have given birth to different variations. The earliest reference to this tale is found in Fern√°n Caballero's L√°grimas (1839) and La Gaviota (1856), but the complete tale is not written until later, in her compilation of tales Cuentos, oraciones, adivinanzas y refranes populares (1877). In this early version, the little she-mouse is actually a little ant, but she still marries a mouse, called Rat√≥n P√©rez. This little mouse (\\"rat√≥n\\" in Spanish), would later inspire Padre Coloma, who would make him part of the Spanish traditional folklore by turning him into a sort of Tooth Fairy. Fern√°n Caballero's version has the four parts explained in the previous section. The third and the fourth parts have a strong parallelism with the English Fairy Tale Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse, first collected in Joseph Jacobs English Fairy Tales (1890). Joseph Jacobs found 25 variants of the same droll scattered over the world from India to Spain, and discusses various theories of its origin. A second literary reference can be found in Carmen Lyra's Cuentos de mi t√≠a Panchita (1920), in which, although she acknowledges it to be the same tale as Fern√°n Caballero's, she also leaves room for an oriental or African origin. In fact, the tale is titled La Cucarachita Mandinga (Mandinga, the Little Roach) and Mandinga is just another name for the Mandinka people. This leads to believe of some influences from the slaves brought from Africa. The tales of the book became part of the Costa Rican folklore, but the Little Roach is also known in Cuba, Mexico and Panama. In Panama it became even more important as it is an important part of Panamanian folklore after it was turned into a children's theater play by Rogelio Sin√°n and with music of Gonzalo Brenes. In some versions, the cockroach is not Mandinga, but Mondinga and in the Cuban and Caribbean version it seems to be Martina. Additionally, the representation of the main character can also change from country to country, probably depending on the greater influence of Carmen Lyra or Fern√°n Caballero. Puerto Rican Pura Belpr√©'s version (as told to her by her grandmother) was the first one published in the US, translated as Perez and Martina: a Puerto Rican Folktale (1932). In 1936 Saturnino Calleja published another version La hormiguita se quiere casar, in which the mouse in saved from the broth by the little ant. There are a couple of contemporary versions that are worth mentioning, since they can easily be found in children's bookstores: Daniel Moreton's version (La Cucaracha Martina: a Caribbean folktale), which seems to take root in Belpre's version and Joe Hayes' version, which has replaced the roach with a butterfly in his tale Mariposa: the butterfly or Mariposa Mariposa: the happy tale of La Mariposa the butterfly Educational value The structure of this tale makes it suitable for personalization and adaptation to the particular children hearing it. It's also useful in order to teach the little kids about the animals and their different sounds, or to make them participate doing the sounds. Finally, some sense of danger can be taught to the audience in the first part of the tale, by mentioning objects that can harm them or things they shouldn't play with.

He played for Nigeria and was a participant at the 2002 World Cup. He usually played as a left fullback, being also used as center back. Club career Udeze played for clubs such as Bendel Insurance FC, AO Kavalas (Greece), and PAOK Thessaloniki, before joining West Bromwich Albion in 2003. In his first season with the Albion, he played in the Premier League, joining the club on loan in the latter stages of the season after which Albion were relegated. He was released from AEK Athens on January 2007, six months after signing a three-year contract on 11 August 2006. On 4 July 2007 he returned to PAOK FC, signing a two-year deal. A niggling knee injury prevented him from grabbing a first team spot and he was released after a year at the club. International career Udeze first came into international limelight at the inaugural UEFA- CAF Meridian Cup held in Portugal in 1997, a tournament where Spain's Xavi Hernandez and Portugal's Simao made their mark. He was a member of the Fanny Amun-led Nigerian squad that beat Spain 3‚Äì2 to win the tournament. Some members of the squad included Rabiu Afolabi, Joseph Enakarhire, Bright Igbinadolor, Chijioke Nwankpa, Hashimu Garba, and Mohammed Aliyu Datti. Having made his full international debut in 2001, Udeze went on to feature for Nigeria at the 2002 African Cup of Nations and 2004, and the 2002 World Cup, playing two games. At the 2002 African Cup of Nations held in Mali, he was selected among the CAF Team of the Tournament. During his playing days, he was Super Eagles' second choice left-back to former Chelsea left-back, Celestine Babayaro. On some occasions, he played together with Babayaro; both switching positions from the left full-back to the left wing of the midfield, often confusing opponents with their identical style of play. Udeze was noted for his feistiness, intelligent marking and remarkable recovery rate. He was Nigeria's most fouled defender in games he featured in. Whenever he joined the attack, he was seldom dispossessed of the ball without winning a free-kick, corner or throw-in. Udeze last featured for Nigeria in a 2006 World Cup qualifier against Angola national football team in 2005.

During the summer of 1982, they met again at Punta del Este (Uruguay), Cerati with his group Sauvage and Bosio with The Morgan. Due to a series of adventures, Cerati and Bosio established a close musical bond and friendship which led them to play together. Zeta and Gustavo shared the same musical tastes and dreams, and began a search for integrating a punk rock group inspired by The Police (who played the same year in Argentina), with their own songs in Spanish. Cerati first joined The Morgan and then formed a band called the Stress (along with Charlie Amato and drummer Pablo Guadalupe), then Erekto Project with Andres Calamaro. Shortly after Gustavo and Zeta decided to visit Charly Alberti (son of the famous percussionist Tito Alberti, who was four years younger than Bosio and three years younger than Cerati), to hear him play his father's drums. Soda Stereo was formed there, and debuted in July 1983. In Soda Stereo, Zeta played the bass and sang backing vocals. He also played acoustic guitar and the chapman stick. Soda Stereo was dissolved in September 1997 and subsequently Zeta worked with other groups, first through the web Under Project, then as manager of Sony Music Argentina, and in more recent years with Alert Discos.

History View of Erlach town with the Jolimont hills to the right Erlach Castle Aerial view (1962) The nearby Jolimont hills, a long range of hills, have been nearly constantly inhabited for thousands of years. In 1847, three grave mounds from the Middle Bronze Age were excavated. The graves dated to the mid 2nd millennium BC and contained numerous grave goods and weapons. Other graves have been discovered from the Hallstatt era, around 500 BC. A Roman road runs along the southern foot of the hills, between Lake Biel and the town of Petinesca (now Studen). Erlach is first mentioned in 1185 as Erilacho and in 1274 as Cellie. In French it is called Cerlier. In 1264/66 Erlach received a Handfeste or document of rights from Count Rudolf II of Neuch√¢tel-Nidau. The village of Sunkort's church was built and consecrated in the 11th Century. Around 1100 the Benedictine Erlach Abbey was founded on Saint Peter's Island (actually a peninsula). During the 14th Century, the city walls were built. The only remaining city gate, currently part of the Rathaus or town hall, is from this era. Towers were added to the walls in the 15th Century. In 1455 the citizens of Erlach founded a hospital. Based on the rights granted by Rudolf II, Erlach had a mayor and until 1798 a 12-member town council with a 6-18 member advisory body. Portions of Erlach Castle were built in the Middle Ages, but the western main tower was built around 1500. In 1848, during the foundation of the Federal State, Erlach Castle became the district seat. However, thirty years later in 1874, it became a school. Erlach became a market town in 1367, when it was granted the right to hold a weekly market along with two yearly fairs. During the 19th century the number of yearly fairs increased to four. The town's economy was diverse and included agriculture, vineyards on the sunny south-facing hill sides, fishing and transportation on Lake Biel. During the 19th century, the watch industry provided many jobs. The Jura water correction projects of 1874-82 and 1962-72 lowered the water level in the lake and expanded Erlach's shoreline. Geography View of Erlach from across Lake Biel. Both the castle and Jolimont mountain are visible toward the right side Erlach has an area of .

According to Jeffrey Bahr of Medical College of Wisconsin, there is no reflex in humans that would cause such tensing in response to a blow on the head, although striking a partner on the back of the neck or head could cause severe, even lethal injury.  Urban legend  Sex columnist Dan Savage has discussed the alleged practice on several occasions. In 2004, Savage referred to the donkey punch as \\"a sex act that exists only in the imaginations of adolescent boys,\\" adding \\"no one has ever attempted 'the Pirate,' just as no one has ever performed a Hot Karl, delivered a Donkey Punch, or inserted an Icy Mike. They're all fictions.\\" Responding to an enquiry from Wikipedia editors, he again discussed the donkey punch urban legend in his \\"Savage Love\\" column in 2006. He wrote, \\"attempting a Donkey Punch can lead to ... unpleasant outcomes,\\" including \\"injury, death or incarceration\\"; he also pointed out that it \\"doesn't even work.\\" He quoted Jeffrey Bahr, a faculty member at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Jordan Tate, commenting in The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms (2007) on the \\"almost purely theoretical nature\\" of the term, claimed,  Gay sex  The concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English (2007) defines the term as follows:  Pornography  Gia Paloma is credited as the first recipient of a donkey punch in a pornographic film The adult film star credited as the first known recipient of a donkey punch is Gia Paloma, who had the act performed on her by Alex Sanders in the 2004 film Gutter Mouths 30. Donkey Punch, a pornographic film premised around the act, was released by JM Productions in 2005. The film consists of four scenes in which the male actors engage in rough sex with their female co-stars, punching them repeatedly in the head and body throughout. In response to her experience on the set, performer Alex Devine allegedly stated \\"Donkey Punch was the most brutal, depressing, scary scene that I have ever done,\\" and commented that \\"I actually stopped the scene while it was being filmed because I was in too much pain.\\" The viciousness of the film prompted Peter van Aarle of Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews to forego covering any further releases from JM, while Zack Parsons of Something Awful (which awarded Donkey Punch a score of -49, where -50 is the worst score possible) wrote that the film was \\"one of the most morally repugnant pornographic movies I have seen\\" and \\"is the sort of movie that the government would cite when trying to arrest pornographers and outlaw pornography.\\"  Enron scandal  \\"Donkey punch\\" was one of several slang terms used by Enron traders to refer to their price gouging methods. During investigations into the 2004 Enron scandal over manipulation of the electricity market in California, recordings of Enron traders were uncovered dating from 2000 and 2001. In the recordings, fraudulent accounting schemes were referred to using slang terms, including \\"Donkey Punch.\\" The 2007 report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was unable to identify the meaning that Enron had attached to the term \\"Donkey Punch.\\" U.S. senator Maria Cantwell, in a 2004 press release about the Enron hearings, identified the Donkey Punch as \\"a crude pornographic term,\\" one of many \\"lewd acts\\" that Enron employees used to describe their schemes.

They circulate in the blood and are found in peripheral lymphoid organs. They develop from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and constitute < 0.4% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Other than conducting antiviral mechanisms, pDCs are considered to be key in linking the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, pDCs are also responsible for participating in and exacerbating certain autoimmune diseases like lupus. pDCs that undergo malignant transformation cause a rare hematologic disorder, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Development and Characteristics In the bone marrow, common dendritic cell progenitors expressing Flt3 (CD135) receptors are able to give rise to pDCs. Flt3 or CD135 signaling induces differentiation and proliferation of pDCs, although their mechanisms are not entirely understood. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is believed to regulate this signaling pathway. Transcription factor E2-2 has also been found to play a key role in influencing the lineage commitment of a common DC progenitor on its course to becoming a pDC. Unlike conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) that leave the bone marrow as precursors, pDCs leave the bone marrow to go to the lymphoid organs and peripheral blood upon completing development. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are also distinguished from cDCs because of their ability to produce significant amounts of type-1 interferon. pDC maturation is initiated when the cell comes in contact with a virus, prompting the upregulation of MHC class I and MHC class II, co- stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, CD83, and c-c chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and interferon production gradually decreases. CCR7 expression prompts the matured pDC to migrate to a lymph node where it will be able to stimulate and interact with T cells. In humans, pDCs exhibit plasma cell morphology and express CD4, HLA-DR, CD123, blood-derived dendritic cell antigen-2 (BDCA-2), Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR9 within endosomal compartments. Expression of TLR 7 and TLR 9 allows pDCs to interact with viral and host nucleic acids. TLR 7 and TLR 9 detect ssRNA and unmethylated CpG DNA sequences, respectively. ILT7 and BDCA-4 are also expressed on human pDC surfaces, although their signaling pathways are still obscure. However, there are speculations that the interaction between ILT7 and BST2 may have a negative regulatory effect on the cell‚Äôs interferon production. Unlike myeloid dendritic cells, myeloid antigens like CD11b, CD11c, CD13, CD14 and CD33 are not present on pDC surfaces. Furthermore, pDCs express markers CD123, CD303 (BDCA-2) and CD304 unlike other dendritic cell types.  Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm  Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare type of myeloid cancer in which malignant pDCs infiltrate the skin, bone marrow, central nervous system, and other tissues. Typically, the disease presents with skin lesions (e.g. nodules, tumors, papules, bruise-like patches, and/or ulcers) that most often occur on the head, face, and upper torso. This presentation may be accompanied by cPC infiltrations into other tissues to result in swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver, enlarged spleen, symptoms of central nervous system dysfunction, and similar abnormalities in breasts, eyes, kidneys, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, bone, sinuses, ears, and/or testes. The disease may also present as a pDC leukemia, i.e. increased levels of malignant pDC in blood (i.e. >2% of nucleated cells) and bone marrow and evidence (i.e. cytopenias) of bone marrow failure. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm has a high rate of recurrence following initial treatments with various chemotherapy regimens. In consequence, the disease has a poor overall prognosis and newer chemotherapeutic and novel non- chemotherapeutic drug regimens to improve the situation are under study. Role In Immunity Upon stimulation and subsequent activation of TLR7 and TLR9, these cells produce large amounts (up to 1,000 times more than other cell type) of type I interferon (mainly IFN-Œ± and IFN-Œ≤), which are critical anti-viral compounds mediating a wide range of effects and induce maturation of the pDC. For example, the secretion of type 1 interferon triggers natural killer cells to produce IFNŒ≥ while also activating the differentiation of B cells. In addition, they can produce cytokines IL-12, IL-6 and TNF-Œ± as well, helping to recruit other immune cells to the site of infection. Because they are capable of activating other immune cells, pDCs serve as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. A pDC's ability to stimulate T cells is heightened following maturation. As mentioned earlier, maturation also induces the expression of both MHC Class I and Class II molecules in pDCs as well, which allows the cell to optimize its antigen-presenting abilities. MHC class I on pDC surfaces are able to activate CD8+ T cells, while MHC class II have been found to activate CD4+ T cells. pDCs are also thought to be able to promote both T cell activation and tolerance. Role in Autoimmunity and Diseases =Psoriasis= Patients who suffer from psoriasis typically exhibit skin lesions where pDCs accumulate. Inhibiting pDCs from secreting IFN diminished the appearance of the skin lesions. When DNA is released via apoptosis of an infected host cell, antibodies are produced against the host's own DNA. (see autoantibody). These anti-host DNA antibodies are able to stimulate pDCs which proceed to secrete IFN, furthering the activity of adaptive immunity. =Lupus= Although the pDC's ability to mass produce type 1 interferon can be effective in targeting a viral infection, it can also lead to Systemic lupus erythematosus if not regulated properly. Type 1 interferon production is strongly correlated with the progression of lupus, and is thought to drive excessive maturation of pDCs and activation of B cells, among many other effects. In patients with lupus, pDC levels in the circulating blood are decreased most of the pDCs have migrated toward the inflamed and affected tissues. =HIV= The mass production of type 1 interferon may result in both positive and negative outcomes in response to HIV. Although type 1 interferon is efficient at facilitating maturation in pDCs and in killing infected T cells, excessive clearance of infected T cells may have detrimental effects and further weaken the patient's compromised immune system. pDCs themselves can be infected by HIV but are also capable of sensing viral markers such as ssRNA and are impaired in their interferon-producing capacities. However, it seems that in HIV, pDCs not only lose their interferon secreting properties but also die, expediting the progression of the disease. Decreases in functional, live of uninfected pDCs have resulted in decreases in CD4+ T cells that further compromise the patient's immune defenses against HIV. Thus, maintaining balance and regulation of pDC activity is crucial for a more positive prognosis in HIV patients.

It is a game based purely on chance, but remained suspenseful because both rewards and risk increased as it progressed. The game was invented by David Briggs, a former traffic reporter for Capital FM who went on to create Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? He also provided the smooth voice on the recordings. The contestants were primed by Capital Radio's Breakfast Show host, Chris Tarrant, whose collaboration with Briggs led to him becoming the presenter of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? How it works A recorded voice reads a sequence of numbers, representing an amount of money, that increases in value by irregular amounts. For example: ¬£1, ¬£4, ¬£20, ¬£31, ¬£70, ¬£72, ¬£300, ¬£301, ¬£600.... The recording ends, at an unpredictable point, with a \\"bong\\" sound. If the player shouts \\"stop\\" before the \\"bong\\", he or she wins the last sum of money mentioned. If the player waits too long and is interrupted by the \\"bong\\", he or she wins nothing. Contestants who shouted \\"stop\\" would then be played the rest of the tape to see how much more they could have won. The numbers would go up in varying increments, sometimes 3 or 4 numbers differing by only a few pounds, and then a jump of several hundred pounds. There were also various special tapes that had holidays on them, if the contestant waited long enough (without being bonged out). An additional variation was the \\"Bouncing Bong\\" which, instead of just going up, went up and down randomly, with the contestant having no idea whether the next number would be higher or lower than the current one. Again, if the tape \\"bonged out\\" before the contestant said stop, they received nothing. Similar shows *Colour of Money, which started in 2009, uses an extended version of the same principle, in which winnings are accumulated through repeated playings of the Bong Game *Deal or No Deal *The New Treasure Hunt * The People Versus, daytime version, used a variant of the Bong Game; contestants would choose one of three sequences, one of which would permit the entire sum of money previously won to be retained before the \\"bong\\" was sounded References Category:British game shows ","title":"Bong game"},{"id":"5683055","text":"Challaborough The beach Challaborough is a village and popular surfing beach in the District of South Hams on the south coast of Devon, England. The village is in the parish of Ringmore, though the eastern part of the small bay and beach lies in Bigbury parish. The beach is popular with surfers from Plymouth and the surrounding area because of its powerful waves. Challaborough village consists of two small static caravan sites (one of which is owned by Parkdean Resorts) and a few private houses. Most properties have views of Burgh Island and Bigbury Bay. The beach is popular with surfers and holidaymakers. It is a horseshoe shaped bay with a sand bar protecting the entrance. The beach is divided by a small stream that runs from the valley down into the sea that forms the boundary between the parishes of Ringmore and Bigbury. For boats there are two slipways. One is privately owned by one of the caravan sites and is better maintained, although rather steep. Members of the public have to pay to use the private slipway, but the public slipway, which is only suitable for smaller boats, is free for all to use. Challaborough is popular with the diving community as there are several wrecks along the nearby coastline. Fishing is also good in the area as well as sailing and cruising. Although Challaborough is part of two civil parishes, Bigbury and Ringmore, and therefore does not have its own council, there is a local action group that aims to protect community interests. There are many footpaths as well as the coastal footpath. To the east is the more developed resort of Bigbury-on-Sea and Burgh Island. In the other direction along the coast are a number of coves, Ayrmer Cove and Westcombe (pronounced Wis-com); although more challenging to walk to are far quieter and picturesque. A little further west is the mouth and estuary of the River Erme. The static caravans at Challaborough are mostly privately owned, but there are some hire fleet caravans. Facilities on the lower site include a nightclub, arcade, swimming pool, bar, shop, launderette and child's play facilities. The upper site generally enjoys better views but has fewer facilities and is situated on a steep hill. Disabled access around the lower site and the beach is usually very good; in the winter the sand sometimes shifts below the level of the disabled beach access. Dogs are banned from the beach during the summer months. RNLI lifeguards patrol most of the year. The surf at Challaborough can be excellent, powerful and well formed, hence the popularity of this venue with surfers from all over South Devon.

Lehman High School is a public high school at 3000 East Tremont Avenue, in the Westchester Square section of the Bronx, New York City. The school is named after former New York State Governor Herbert Henry Lehman (1878‚Äì1963). The school is not affiliated with Lehman College in the Bronx, also named after the governor, but does hold its annual graduation ceremony there each June. History The school's first graduating class was in June 1974. In late 2006 and early 2007 the school underwent an external renovation that included painting the entire building. Much of the work was done during the night to avoid disrupting classes. Robert Leder was the school's second principal and had remained principal for most of its 37-year existence. After a New York City Department of Education's investigation of two assistant principals and abuse of overtime funds, Mr. Leder was given the choice to resign his post as principal at the end of the year, or be immediately removed and reassigned. His decision, amid a great deal of student and parent protest, was to resign effective June 30, 2008.Popular Lehman principal forced outAt Lehman, coach's job in jeopardyGoodbye! Leder bids farewell The new executive principal, appointed in July 2008, was Dr. Janet Saraceno, formerly the principal of High School for Media and Communications in Manhattan. After 3 years, Saraceno resigned due to student grade tampering, and was replaced by Mrs. Rose Lobianco, the former assistant principal of Columbus High School in the Bronx.Principal to Resign Following Grade-Altering InquiryPrincipal at Lehman High School Is Said to Be OutQuestioning Turnaround at Lehman High School in the Bronx  Athletics  =Sports= Lehman offers a variety of athletic clubs and teams for the students. Its mascot is a lion and its colors are blue and orange. Its varsity football, baseball, soccer, track and field and wrestling teams have had success over the years. Perhaps the most followed sport at Lehman is football. The former coach of Lehman's varsity football team, Carmine Colasanto, has been recognized as one of the PSAL's best coaches. He has recorded over 200 career victories and has been honored with numerous coach of the year awards. Coach Colasanto was the longest tenured coach in the PSAL until his resignation before the 2008 season. Some of the players Coach Colasanto had were former NFL players Doug Marrone(Head Coach at Syracuse University), Charles Puleri. Lehman football has produced numerous IA players and have sent alum to Tulane, Georgia Tech, Maryland, Syracuse and Cincinnati among numerous prominent schools. The football team is now led by the only woman head football coach in the PSAL, Ms Deborah Vance. Coach Vance had a successful run with the Junior Varsity and is now establishing her legacy with the varsity, leading Lehman from 1‚Äì8 to a 5‚Äì4 record and a playoff appearance in 2009. The school's varsity football team has been consistently ranked among the PSAL's best and has been in numerous Citywide championships. Junior varsity football is also offered and the team has also met with success in recent years, even managing to finish the 2007 season a perfect 8-0, and winning the New York City championship. Lehman's soccer team won their first New York City Championship back in the PSAL B division in 2001 and made an appearance back to the finals in the PSAL A division in 2006, eventually falling against MLK Jr High School 4‚Äì0. Also in the 2009‚Äì2010 season, Lehman finished the Bronx A Division with a record of 9‚Äì0‚Äì3, an undefeated season although they finished second behind Christopher Columbus. Led by Coach Straw, Lehman has become one of the best teams in the Bronx alongside Christopher Columbus and Bronx Science. Since 2001, they have made it to the playoffs every season finishing in the top 4. =Logo and uniforms= Since its inception the school's colors have been orange and blue and the mascot the lion. The home football uniform consists of a Royal blue jersey with blue numbers outlined in white and orange piping with blue pants highlighted in orange and white. The road uniform is a white jersey with blue numbers outlined in orange with orange piping and it accompanies blue pants. The helmet is solid orange with a blue paw print on both sides. The Baseball uniform consist of white pants with a blue and orange stripe down the pant legs. The jersey consist of a white top with an interlocking \\"HL\\" which is blue outlined in orange. The hat is all blue with an HL logo in white with orange outlining. The basketball team also has representation within the PSAL but isn't as prominent as football, baseball, soccer or softball.

In addition, Westchester Square Academy is also collocated on the Herbert H. Lehman campus but its school is limited and only take up parts of the 4th floor.

She was sent there with the household of Margherita Gonzaga d'Este at the time of Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, and was a young woman at the time, around fifteen. Livia was the daughter of a minor Mantuan noble, and was perhaps sent to the court in Ferrara because of her musical potential. When she arrived, she began studying the viol with Luzzasco Luzzaschi and Ippolito Fiorini. After a few years of study she joined Laura Peverara, Tarquinia Mola and Anna Guarini in the Concerto delle donne; the first record of her singing with them was in 1582. Like the other members of the Concerto, poems were written in her honor, specifically by Torquato Tasso and Angelo Grillo under the pseudonym Livio Celiano. In 1585 she was married to Count Alfonso Bevilacqua.

He is quoted as saying \\"Life is boring for someone trying to achieve greatness.\\" Early years Born in Arkansas City, Kansas, Crowder was raised in Muskogee, Oklahoma. He played quarterback at Muskogee Central High School and won the state championship in 1948. Playing career Crowder was a member of Oklahoma's first National Football Championship team in 1950, and led Oklahoma to two Big Seven titles as quarterback in 1951 and 1952 and was selected all-conference the same years. Oklahoma was during his three years as a player. He was 61 for 110 (.555) (might be 60 for 109 (.550)) with 11 touchdowns for 1189 (might be 1179) yards passing. He was selected in the second round (22nd overall) of the 1953 NFL Draft by the New York Giants, but declined due to a nerve problem in his throwing arm and served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as quarterback of the Fort Hood team for 1953. His jersey number was 16 and was listed at and . Although selected by the Giants, Crowder went to Canada in 1953 and played the first half of the season with the Edmonton Eskimos, alternating starts at quarterback with Claude Arnold. He was cut by head coach Darrell Royal because of limitations on the number of American players that a team could carry past a certain date. Crowder led the Eskimos to victory in all four of his games, but Royal decided to stick with the veteran Arnold. In a game in Calgary on September 5, Crowder played the full game at quarterback without throwing a single pass; all the passes were thrown by halfbacks Rollie Miles and Billy Vessels. \\"Easy Ed\\" was one of many Oklahoma grads to play for the Eskimos in the 1950s. Coaching career Crowder was an assistant coach under Red Blaik at Army in 1955 and for Bud Wilkinson back at Oklahoma for eight seasons He became the head coach of the Buffaloes in January 1963 and restored the program's respectability and earned national respect while rebuilding the program.

The text was most likely written during the early Han dynasty and claims to be a conversation between Confucius and his student Zengzi. The text was widely used during the Han and later dynasties to teach young children basic moral messages as they learnt to read. Authorship This document probably dates to the 4th century BC . It is not known who actually wrote the document. It is attributed to a conversation between Confucius and his disciple Zengzi. A 12th-century author named He Yin claimed: \\"The Classic of Filial Piety was not made by Zengzi himself. When he retired from his conversation (or conversations) with Kung-ne on the subject of Filial Piety, he repeated to the disciples of his own school what (the master) had said, and they classified the sayings, and formed the treatise.\\" Content As the title suggests, the text elaborates on filial piety, which is a core Confucian value. The text argues that if a person loves and serves their parents then they will do the same for their rulers, leading to a harmonious society. For example,  Influence  The Classic of Filial Piety occupied an important position in classical education as one of the most popular foundational texts through to late imperial China. The text was used in elementary and moral education together with the Analects, Elementary Learning, and the Biographies of Exemplary Women. Study of the text was also mentioned in epitaphs as an indication of a person's good character. It was a practice to read aloud the text when mourning one's parents. The text was also important politically, partly because filial piety was both a means of demonstrating moral virtue and entering officialdom for those with family connections to the imperial court. The text was important in Neo-Confucianism and was quoted by the influential Song figure and Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi. Translations Many Japanese translations of the Xiaojing exist.

It was founded in 1974 and is located in College Station, Texas, in the United States. Overview The Texas A&M; University Press was founded in 1974 under the direction of Texas A&M; University president and chancellor Jack K. Williams. The first director of the press, Frank H. Wardlaw, had previously helped to establish the University of Texas Press and the University of South Carolina Press. From its founding, the press has operated as a university department, reporting directly to the university president. The press is expected to \\"further the objectives of the university through publications devoted to advancing knowledge among scholars and to enriching the cultural heritage of the Southwest.\\" The original press offices were destroyed by a fire in February 1979. They were replaced in 1983 with the construction of the John H. Lindsey Building. This allows for offices, the warehouse, and a shipping area to be consolidated under one roof. The press is funded by book sales, an endowment, and financial support from Texas A&M; University. Works In September 1975, the press published its first work, Elizabeth A. H. John's Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds. Within a decade, the press had begun publishing over thirty titles a year. The press has published works in several series designed to feature regional history. Among these are the Centennial Series of the Association of Former Students, which concerns aspects of Texas A&M;'s history, the Montague History of Oil Series, the Texas A&M; Southwestern Studies Series, and the Clayton Wheat Williams Texas Life Series. Additionally, the press has developed a series featuring regional art, the Joe and Betty Moore Texas Art Series, one dealing with regional literature (the Tarleton State University Southwestern Studies in the Humanities), and the Louise Lindsey Merrick Texas Environment Series and the W.L. Moody, Jr. Natural History Series, which cover natural history. Fiction and nonfiction of the 19th and 20th centuries are also reprinted as part of the Southwest Landmarks series. The press has also published works dealing with military history, architecture, business history, chemistry, economics, veterinary medicine, nautical archeology and engineering. Apart from its own publications, the press also distributes books from various other university presses, including Texas Review Press, Rice University Press and Texas Christian University Press, as well as books from the Texas State Historical Association.
