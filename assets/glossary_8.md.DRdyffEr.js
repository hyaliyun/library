September 05, 2020 The novel is set in a near future where virtual reality has become a norm and where geeks can use it to gain superpowers and extraordinary abilities. It was written by the author as a homage to geek culture from comics, films, anime and video games. Upon its release, it garnered positive reception from critics and became one of the best pop culture fiction titles to date. Plot The story takes place in a virtual reality world known as the Escapist Dream, where all kinds of geeks can live a life of superpowered adventures based on their favorite film, comic, anime, novel or video game characters. Two individuals ‚Äì a shy teenage geek named Charlie, and a serious programmer named Jim ‚Äì came to the Escapist Dream for different reasons. One came to this virtual reality to have fun while the other was sent to fix bugs that have been plaguing the Escapist Dream. Charlie and Jim would soon find out how the bugs have caused madness in this place, and must now work together to protect themselves and save the Escapist Dream. Publication history According to the book‚Äôs afterword, the novel was inspired by the comic books, anime and video games that author Louis Bulaong grew up with in his childhood.Bulaong, Louis. Escapist Dream. Afterword. The story was written in a smooth flow of thoughts in the author‚Äôs Filipino-English accent. August 9, 2020 As a homage, it took tropes from different mediums and contained a number of pop cultural references. Reception Author Justin Kidd praised the book as a pop culture masterpiece, stating \\"The large amounts of pop culture references were well- written and well-integrated into the story, unlike some who only add references for the sake of it. These references both described and satirized geeks in a humorous and intellectual way. In the world of literature and geek culture, Escapist Dream is by far, The Great Gatsby of Pop Culture Fiction.\\"Kidd, Dustin. Pop Culture Freaks: Identity, Mass Media, and Society.

Roldan Tan from Rewritee listed it at #3 in his 5 Best GameLit and LitRPG Books, saying ‚ÄúOf all GameLit books in history, none is as grand in scale as this one-of-a kind novel.‚Äù The review also added, ‚ÄúIn its portrayal of gaming culture, author Louis Bulaong really nailed every trope from video games and the gaming community in general. While the story praises the talents gamers possess, it also satirizes many of gaming culture‚Äôs funniest quirks, from trash-talking, using cheats, the console wars, and to the war against microtransactions.‚Äù August 30, 2020 Carl Hannigan from Geek gave it a 5 out of 5 rating, stating ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not being hyperbolic when I say that this is one of the best GameLit novels I have ever read. The style of writing was compact and concise and every character was really well-written and relatable. Of course, the book is not perfect. It starts too slow and the ending was a bit stretched.

She first appeared in Gears of War 4 as a supporting character, and is the primary protagonist of Gears 5. Within the series, she is originally a member of the Outsiders, a loosely organized faction of rebel human settlers who live outside of the walled city states of the supranational and intergovernmental military collective known as the Coalition of Ordered Governments (\\"COG\\"), following the conclusion of humanity's war with the Locust Horde on the planet Sera. By the events of Gears 5, she has enlisted with the COG armed forces and has attained the rank of corporal. The character is voiced by Laura Bailey in each of her appearances. Outside of the video game series, Kait has appeared in the novels Gears of War: Ascendance and Gears of War: Bloodlines. Kait Diaz is the first lead female character of the Gears of War video game franchise, which is predominantly known for its hypermasculine male characters. The Coalition, a subsidiary of Xbox Game Studios and the current developers responsible for the Gears of War franchise following its acquisition from Epic Games, intended for a strong female lead to replace Marcus Fenix and wrote the narrative arc of the fourth and fifth installments of the franchise around the character. Kait has been received positively, and is considered to be one of the more popular characters in the Gears of War series. She has been praised for her nuanced characterization, strong backstory, and as a positive example of gender equality and representation in video games. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released. Creation and development Kait Diaz is designed as a character with Latino roots; this is represented by her raven-black hair, slightly larger, darker eyebrows, and freckles. The Coalition's character designers felt that mixing these traits with typically Caucasian features give her an \\"interesting look\\". Her less regimented look is a reflection of her youthful urge to stand out among her peers, as well as her literal background as an \\"Outsider\\" compared to the other main characters in Gears of War 4; unlike J.D. Fenix, son of Marcus Fenix and Anya Stroud, and Delmont \\"Del\\" Walker, Kait is an Outsider from birth and her attire has a completely different look without any visual cues that would connect her to COG society. She utilizes reclaimed fabric and her wardrobe has multipurpose elements. The beanie she wears help maintain her aesthetic as a grounded character. One of the ways the designers have explored the Outsider culture of Sera through visual language is through the hairstyles of its female members, which is an indicator of their marital status: Kait's mother, Reyna Diaz, hangs her ponytail over her right shoulder, while hers is hung on the left shoulder as she is single. Then-studio head Rod Fergusson compared the story arc of Gears of War 4 to Mad Max: Fury Road, in the sense that Tom Hardy's Max Rockatansky is functionally a supporting character even though he is ostensibly the eponymous lead character of the movie. He further elaborated that, \\"Max is really there to support Furiosa's journey as she's trying to escape, and that's kind of what Gears 4 was. [It] was really Kait's story about trying to save her mom, and JD was there to help.\\" Kait's transition from a supporting character to protagonist in Gears 5 is reflected by the ending of its prequel, where it is revealed that her past is connected to the new threat facing the world of Sera. She wears COG-issued armor as she has enlisted with the organization as a soldier by the events of Gears 5. The designers explored different looks for Kait that evolved from her Gears of War 4 attire as well as armor variations which match the different environments she visits, while preserving a few elements of her Outsider heritage, especially her braid. The Coalition staff have disclosed during interviews that the decision to place Kait as the protagonist in Gears 5 was planned over a number of years, and it involved change on a cultural level for the company. Fillip Foksowicz, a game designer at The Coalition, said that Fergusson and the game's team of writers decided early on during the production of Gears 5 that they wanted to have a female lead, and so the game's whole story was written around Kait, in his words \\"fully embracing her as a female and truly showing all of her strengths\\". Foksowicz said the team understood that they could not simply write a story and replace certain characters with females or various cultural backgrounds where it fit simply to meet a predetermined quota, as it would not be possible to truly define them as believable characters. According to franchise narrative lead Bonnie Jean Mah, a strong, well-rounded female character is \\"someone who is authentic and has a full range of emotions\\", and she claimed that her company ensured that there is ample opportunities for participation by female staff in the game's developmental team. Appearances =Video games= Kait is introduced in Gears of War 4 as a part of a group of Outsiders including J.D. and Del, two COG deserters. The trio, led by J.D., are the main focus of the game's narrative as they discover a new threat to humanity, a successor to the original Locust Horde known as the Swarm, who has kidnapped numerous victims from various human settlements, including Kait's mother Reyna and uncle Oscar. By the game's ending, Kait comes into possession of an amulet that once belonged to Myrrah, Queen of the Locust Horde, after she is forced to euthanize Reyna. Kait is the central character of Gears 5, which explores her backstory as she plays a pivotal role in humanity‚Äôs conflict against the resurgent Swarm. She is depicted as enduring recurring nightmares she believes to be messages. Following the death of Oscar, who led an Outsider settlement called Riftworm Village in their defense against a Swarm raid, she travels to a remote area in search of answers about her maternal family's connection to the origins of the Locust Horde. She eventually discovers that Queen Myrrah is her grandmother, and that a resurrected and mutated Reyna has succeeded her estranged mother Myrrah in leading a genocidal war against humanity. Gears Tactics, a spin-off of the Gears of War franchise, features Kait's father Sgt. Gabriel Diaz as the protagonist and details how he first met Reyna Diaz (n√©e Torres). =Novels= Kait is one of the main characters of Gears of War: Ascendance, a novel which acted set between Gears of War 4 and Gears 5. She is also the main character of Gears of War: Bloodlines, which is set during the intervening four months between the evacuation of Settlement 2 and the siege of Riftworm Village in Gears 5. Reception Kait Diaz has received a positive critical response. In his review of Gears of War 4 for The Guardian in October 2016, Steve Boxer noted that Kait is the franchise‚Äôs first properly central female character and was positive in his assessment of the game's campaign and cast of characters. Kait's depiction in Gears 5 drew critical praise for her level of complexity, range of emotions, and strong backstory. Multiple sources formed a view that her role in Gears 5 led to more nuance in its narrative, and brought more emotional depth and maturity to the series as a whole. George Yang from The Escapist opined that Gears 5 was able to pivot the narrative to explore Kait‚Äôs story in a way that felt natural, because the strong story of the Gears series allows Kait to be in the spotlight since questions about her lineage appeared in Gears of War 4. Sam Byford from The Verge was of the view that the game's plot does a great job throughout of establishing the stakes on both a personal and global level, giving emotional momentum to the storytelling about Kait's exploration of her heritage even as the world is on the brink of collapse. In his review of Gears 5 for The Bleacher Report, Chris Roling said that Kait's past and conflicts \\"are exploited for some excellent, creative gameplay sequences even longtime fans of the series won't see coming\\". John Saavedra from Den of Geek opined that Kait and Del outshone the series‚Äô original duo of Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago as they have actual personalities and motivations that go beyond ‚Äúkilling Grubs‚Äù, highlighting their banter to be a delightful experience which adds necessary levity to a plot that often place its characters in tragic circumstances. Kaan Serin from TheXboxHub proclaimed the character to be one of the best heroines in gaming. The decision by the Coalition to feature Kait as the central protagonist of Gears 5 attracted significant media coverage. Several sources have commented that the decision to promote a female side character to series protagonist represents a major departure in creative direction for the series, and an important development for the games as a whole. This is due to the fact that the Gears of War game franchise is stereotyped for being a ‚Äúbro-shooter‚Äù and for its \\"dudebro machismo\\". Many industry watchers perceived the replacement of lead character Marcus Fenix with Kait Diaz as a bold move by the developer. Brittany Vincent observed that while the series has had female characters like Anya Stroud to help punctuate the narrative, this is the first time \\"a woman has been at the forefront\\" for the series. She compared this to \\"swapping in Spartan Kat in for her own personal Halo title instead of giving her a little time in Halo: Reach\\". Byford said the shift in focus \\"does wonders\\", noting that the franchise's move to its first female lead does not feel forced, nor was it ever directly acknowledged. Todd Martens from The Los Angeles Times noted that Kait's story arc helped bring a sense of mystery to a series filled with monstrous villains and chainsaw guns while reducing the unnecessary machismo prevalent in previous installments. Terry Terrones from The Gazette claimed that Kait makes for a fascinating protagonist and her personal journey gives the franchise a completely new look, even with the presence of Marcus Fenix and his son J.D. within the narrative. Owen Gough felt that the narrative of Gears 5 benefited from an exciting new lead in Kait \\"who manages to revitalise the male-only club of killing monsters, without feeling like it's pandering to an expanded audience\\". Similarly, Roling found Kait's plot points in the narrative to be well handled and remains engaging throughout without being \\"stereotypical gender fodder\\". Shaun Munro from Flickering Myth considered Kait to be the most sympathetic and likeable character in the entire Gears series and a more appealing protagonist then J.D., whom he dismissed as a \\"dullard\\". Reflecting on the issue of female leads in video games being perceived as a risky proposition, senior producer at The Coalition Z√∂e Curnoe expressed a desire to see the normalization of women leads in video games and that it would no longer be a newsworthy topic. Bailey voiced Diaz for all video game appearances On the other hand, Osama Niazi from Segment Next expressed concern that The Coalition may not have adequately prepared for a hostile backlash from certain segments of the video game player audience with misogynistic attitudes, citing the significant negative reception to the promotion of female playable characters in Battlefield V as an example. Sherif Saed from VG247 reported an incident which took place during a Q&A; session at a E3 Coliseum panel in June 2019 where John DiMaggio, the voice actor of Marcus Fenix and a panel member, reprimanded an audience member who queried the hosts about Kait Diaz's ‚Äúsexual preference‚Äù. Saed suggested that DiMaggio's response to the way the question was worded implied that it may have been asked in bad faith. Laura Bailey's performance as Kait Diaz has received critical acclaim from several reviewers. Byford credited Bailey's strong performance with anchoring Kait‚Äôs personal struggles in a believable manner, which play out with a surprisingly delicate touch and includes some genuinely shocking moments. For her performance as Kait Diaz, Bailey received nominations for best video game performance of the year award from a few outlets. On the other hand, Alan Wen remarked that Kait is a Hispanic character being played by a white Caucasian actor in his analysis of the issue of whitewashing as well as the lack of opportunities for voice actors from ethnic minority backgrounds. Promotion and merchandise Kait Diaz has been extensively featured by Microsoft in advertising for the Gears of War franchise since the launch of Gears 5 in 2019. Like other characters in the franchise, she has been subject to various merchandise. In 2016, McFarlane Toys released a highly detailed action figure for the character, which stands 7 feet tall, rests atop a stand, and includes her weapon in-hand. In 2019, statue makers First 4 Figures unveiled a resin statue in the character‚Äôs likeness. A limited edition Xbox One controller, modeled after Kait Diaz's armor with a snow-weathered design and Omen symbol, was released on August 20, 2019 as a standalone purchase and was also included in a Limited Edition Bundle for Gears 5.

Early life  Luba Procai was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the daughter of Marie Sokol and Anthony B. Procai. Both of her parents were Ukrainian immigrants.  Career  In 1947, Perchyshyn and her mother started a Ukrainian gift shop, selling traditional embroidery, tapestries, and ceramics, as well as books. They started from home, but soon moved into a storefront on Hennepin Avenue, where Luba Perchyshyn began assembling kits for making pysanky, intricately decorated eggs made with a wax-resist technique. Another family member, Luba's sister Johanna Luciow, joined the business in 1958. In time, the pysanky classes, kits, tools, and other supplies became the shop's signature items. Perchyshyn demonstrated the process on television, on videos, and at cultural events. The Ukrainian Gift Shop was featured in a National Geographic article in 1972, and Perchyshyn's decorated eggs were featured in a 1976 short documentary about pysanky by Slavko Nowytski. Perchyshyn co-authored several books, including Ukrainian Easter Eggs and How We Make Them (1979), and The Ukrainian Design Book (1999). Perchyshyn's eggs were admired and sold internationally, and were included in White House holiday decorations and events.  Personal life and legacy  Luba Procai married Elko Perchyshyn in 1943, while he was serving in World War II. They had children Natalie and Elko. Luba Perchyshyn was widowed in 1986, and she died in 2020, aged 96 years. Marie Sokol Procai died in 1994, and Johanna Procai Luciow died in 1998; the Perchyshyn family continued the business, which remains in operation as of 2020.

He finished unplaced on his only start as a juvenile in 2019 but made rapid improvement in the following year, winning his first four races including the Yeats Stakes and the St Leger Stakes Background Galileo Chrome is a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by his owner Mohamed Ali Meddeb. As a yearling he was put up for auction at the Goffs Orby sale but failed to reach his reserve price. He was sent into training with Joseph Patrick O'Brien at Owning Hill, County Kilkenny. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Australia who won the Epsom Derby, Irish Derby and International Stakes in 2014. Galileo Chrome's dam Curious Mind showed little ability on the track, winning on her debut but finishing last in her only other start. She was a great-grandaughter of the Irish broodmare Alruccaba whose other descendants have included Yesterday, Quarter Moon, Alborada, Allegretto (Prix Royal Oak), Aussie Rules (Poule d'Essai des Poulains) and Albanova (Preis von Europa). Racing career =2019: two-year-old season= Galileo Chrome began his racing career in a maiden race over one mile at Leopardstown Racecourse on 19 October. Ridden by the apprentice jockey Shane Crosse he started at odds of 33/1 and finished fifth of the thirteen runners, eight and a half lengths behind the winner Celtic High King. =2020: three-year-old season= The 2020 flat racing season in Great Britain and Ireland was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Galileo Chrome did not reappear until 12 June when he started the 4/1 second favourite behind Serpentine for a ten furlong maiden at the Curragh. Ridden by Shane Crosse he raced just behind the leaders before finishing strongly and gaining the advantage in the final strides to win by a head from King of the Throne. Crosse was again in the saddle when the colt started odds-on favourite for a minor race over the same distance at Leopardstown on 31 July and won \\"easily\\" by six lengths from five opponents. Galileo Chrome was then stepped up in class and distance for the Listed Yeats Stakes over thirteen furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 29 August and started the 2/1 favourite in a seven-runner field. Ridden by Crosse (who was no longer an apprentice), he went to the front inside the last quarter mile and recorded another easy win, coming hime five lengths clear of Emperor of the Sun. The 244th running of the St Leger took place behind closed doors over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 12 September and Galileo Chrome, ridden by Tom Marquand, started the 4/1 third favourite behind the Irish Derby winner Santiago and Hukum (Geoffrey Freer Stakes) while the best fancied of the other eight contenders were Pyledriver (Great Voltigeur Stakes) and Subjectivist (March Stakes). Marquand had been scheduled to ride English King until that colt was redirected to contest the Grand Prix de Paris on the following day, but when Crosse was forced to self-isolate after a positive COVID test he stepped in to take the ride.

It is one of a series of basins of similar age in southwestern Norway found between Sognefjord and Nordfjord, developed in the hanging-wall of the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment. It is named for the mountain of Kvamshesten. Tectonic setting During the later part of the Silurian period, the western margin of the Baltic Plate was affected by the main collisional event of the Caledonian orogeny, known as the Scandian phase. This led to large-scale thrusting and the development of a mountain belt similar in scale to the Himalayas. Soon after the collision finished during the Early Devonian, the thickened crust began to extend. Initially the extension took place by reactivation of Caledonian thrust faults, known as Mode 1 extension. The uplift and exhumation led to a reduction of dip in these reactivated thrusts, making them progressively less mechanically viable. At this point Mode II extension took over, with development of large extensional shear zones that cross-cut the Caledonian thrust pile, such as the Nordfjord- Sogn Detachment. Basin fill The northern margin of the basin is dominated by conglomerates and breccias deposited by alluvial fans. The southern margin is mainly conglomerate, while with the central axis of the basin is mainly sandstone. Between the marginal conglomerates/breccias and the axial sandstones, finer-grained sequences are locally developed consisting of mudstone, siltstone and fine-grained conglomerate. Structure The overall dip of the Devonian sequence is to the east towards the tectonic contact with the Dalsfjord Fault (Kvamshesten Detachment). The whole sequence, the basement units beneath the unconformable contacts towards the western end of the basin, the detachment and the underlying highly deformed rocks of the shear zone formed by the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment have a synclinal geometry, indicating north‚Äìsouth shortening. The Devonian rocks are cut by a series of high-angle faults, most of them extensional in type with evidence of being active during sedimentation. These faults are confined to the hanging-wall of the underlying detachment fault. Some of these earlier extensional structures show evidence of reactivation as reverse faults. Both the timing and the cause of the observed north‚Äìsouth shortening is uncertain. Suggestions that the shortening happened at the same time as the extension along the detachment, have been countered by there being no evidence of changes in the tightness of the folding with stratigraphic level and a lack of unconformities within the basin fill.

Ultimately, separately grown heterostructures, primarily gallium arsenide / aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs/AlGaAs) distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), are transferred to polished optical surfaces, generating high-performance single-crystal optical coatings on arbitrary, including curved, substrates. The substrate-transferred crystalline coating process was initially published in Nature Photonics in 2013. With additional refinement, the technique is now capable of generating high-reflectivity mirrors with optical losses on par with the best ion-beam-sputtered coatings, with optical absorption in the 1000-2000 nm spectral range demonstrated to be < 1 part-per-million (ppm) and optical scatter < 3 ppm in the best optics. Beyond the excellent achievable optical quality, there are three additional advantages of this process including:https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=13322 # # Significantly reduced elastic losses (at least a factor of 10 over typical amorphous interference coatings) resulting in minimal thermal noise, making such coatings promising for precision optical interferometry for optical atomic clocks and gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO # The potential for ppm-levels of optical losses (absorption + scatter) in the mid-infrared spectral region # A comparably high thermal conductivity, > 20-times higher than typical metal-oxide based coatings, making crystalline coatings promising for high- power continuous wave (CW) and quasi-CW lasers Owing to the low Brownian noise of crystalline coatings there have been a number of recent advancements in quantum-limited interferometry, with these mirrors being instrumental in efforts relevant to macroscopic quantum phenomena and enabling the demonstration of ponderomotive squeezing at room temperature, the broadband reduction of quantum radiation pressure noise via squeezed light injection, and the room temperature measurement of quantum back action in the audio band.

Biography  = Youth = The son of a working-class couple, during his childhood he helped his family with agricultural tasks while attending the village primary school. A metalworker by profession, began working for the company Duro Felguera and at an early age he joined the CNT, the majority union among the metallurgists of La Felguera. He actively participated in the Revolution of 1934, in which he directed a column that arrived from La Felguera in Oviedo on October 6. After the defeat of the Revolution, he was able to escape, but was arrested in Zaragoza on August 7, 1935 together with Constantino Antu√±a Huerta and taken to the Oviedo Prison. Known the victory of the Popular Front in the 1936 Spanish general election, he participated in a prisoner mutiny that obtained their freedom on February 20, one day before the amnesty was promulgated. = Role during the Civil War = At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, on July 17, he participated in the capture of the Civil Guard barracks in La Felguera. Two days later he marched at the head of 400 anarcho-syndicalists towards Gij√≥n, where he had a prominent role in the Siege of Gij√≥n, participating in the taking of Simancas barracks and El Coto. After the capture of the headquarters of the \\"Simancas\\" regiment, a massacre took place, which Carrocera himself tried to prevent without success. Later he directed the military operations during the Siege of Oviedo. In September 1936, he was wounded in the Villafr√≠a sector, during the fight against the nationalists. Confirmed as a militia major, he became one of the main commanders of the confederal militias in Asturias. The anarcho-syndicalist author Diego Abad de Santill√°n described him as an \\"authentic hero\\". Carrocera, a supporter of the militarization of the militias, came to command a battalion and took part in various military operations. In September 1937 he commanded the 192nd Mixed Brigade. At the head of this unit he fought in the Battle of El Mazuco, managing to defend a gorge against nationalist units. Thanks to this, the advance of the nationalist forces was be halted for several days. At the proposal of Francisco Ciutat de Miguel, he was awarded the Medal of Freedom for his performance. = Capture and Execution = After Asturias fell into the hands of the Spanish Army, he was arrested and taken to a concentration camp in Galicia. Carrocera had refused to be evacuated by sea along with other Republican commanders. Upon being recognized, he was taken back to Asturias, where he was again confined to the Oviedo prison. The following month, on February 21, Higinio Carrocera Mortera appeared before a council of war and was sentenced to death, he was shot on May 8, 1938.

The issue remained unresolved, and Bishop Anƒëeo died in Konjic the next year.  Early life  Anƒëeo Kraljeviƒá was born in the village of ƒåerigaj near ≈†iroki Brijeg in Herzegovina, at the time, part of the Ottoman Empire, to father Mate and mother Pera nee Sli≈°koviƒá. He was baptised as Ivan. His uncle Frano Kraljeviƒá was a Franciscan friar. The parents sent him for education to the Franciscan monastery in Kre≈°evo in Autumn of 1821. Kraljeviƒá entered the novitiate of the Franciscan Province of Bosnia on 9 March 1823. The next year he took monastic vows. Even though only 16, as a gifted student, he was sent to Hungary, at the time part of the Austrian Empire for further studies. He finished humanistic studies in Gy√∂ngy√∂s and theology in V√°c in the episcopal lyceum. There, he was ordained a priest on 6 January 1831. On 13 July 1831, he received his absolutorium, thus finishing his studies with excellent success. After returning to Herzegovina, he was appointed a chaplain in Posu≈°je, where he remained until July 1833, after which he became a chaplain in his ƒåerigaj for two years. In 1835, Kraljeviƒá was named a solemn Sunday and holiday preacher in Kre≈°evo, where he remained until 1841. In Kre≈°evo, the Franciscan elders recognised his abilities. During his stay in Kre≈°evo, Kraljeviƒá studied Arabic and Turkish language under mentorship of Fr. Marijan ≈†unjiƒá, later a bishop and Apostolic Vicar of Bosnia. After learning Turkish language, Kraljeviƒá translated the sultans' fermans received by the Franciscans for centuries. After gainin prominence among the Franciscans, some of his fellow monks proposed him as a secretary to Apostolic Vicar of Bosnia Bishop Rafael Bari≈°iƒá, while others wanted him to become a guardian of the Franciscan monastery in Kre≈°evo. However, due to a lack of priests, in 1841 he was appointed a parson in Gradac, Mostar, where he served for a year, after which he returned to Kre≈°evo as a monastery vicar. Since 1840, Kraljeviƒá was one of the leaders of the initiative of the Herzegovinian Franciscans of the monastery in Kre≈°evo who wanted to establish their own monastery in ≈†iroki Brijeg. Other leaders of this initiative were Nikola Kordiƒá and Ilija Vido≈°eviƒá. At the time, Bishop Rafael Bari≈°iƒá had an uneasy relationship with the Bosnian Franciscans. The Herzegovinian Franciscans established contact with Vizier of Herzegovina Ali- pa≈°a Rizvanbegoviƒá who was granted his own eyalet by the Ottoman sultan for his loyalty during the Bosnian uprising. The Franciscans considered that they will build their own monastery faster if the apostolic vicar would come to Herzegovina. The vicar of ƒåerigaj Ilija Vido≈°eviƒá wrote to Bishop Rafael about the idea of establishing a separate Herzegovinian apostolic vicariate, an idea also supported by Ali-pa≈°a. In 1843, Bishop Rafael returned from a trip in Albania and stayed in ƒåerigaj, where Vido≈°eviƒá helped him to establish a connection with Ali-pa≈°a. In 1843, Kraljeviƒá was appointed a guardian of the Franciscan monastery and parson in Kre≈°evo. In 1844, the Church authorities allowed the Franciscans to build a monastery in ≈†iroki Brijeg, so the Herzegovinian Franciscans left their former monasteries to build a new one. In January 1844, Kraljeviƒá went to ≈†iroki Brijeg to serve as the guardian and prepare the construction of the new monastery. On 23 July 1846, the cornerstone of the monastery was finally consecrated and laid down. At the same time, Kraljeviƒá took care of the parish in Gradac. After three years of guardianship in ≈†iroki Brijeg, Kraljeviƒá was transferred again to Posu≈°je in 1846 as a parson. The next year he was transferred to Veljaci, where he stayed for six years. As a parson in Veljaci, Kraljeviƒá also educated the children. In 1850, he bought the land to build another monastery in Humac, Ljubu≈°ki.  Franciscan Custody of Herzegovina  On 3 October 1852, the Holy See established the Franciscan Custody of Herzegovina, whose powers were equal to those of a province. On 9 November 1852, Kraljeviƒá was elected the first custos of the newly-established custody on a term of three years. In August 1853, General of the Franciscan Order Venancio Metildi da Celano wrote to Kraljeviƒá that the Herzegovinian Franciscans lend money with interests, allow the commoners to keep their cattle in exchange for profit, buy cheaper things only to sell them at a higher price, and buy expensive clothes and asked him to investigate those issues. Kraljeviƒá wrote back stating that the accusations cannot apply to the whole custody, but only to particular monks. The Deputy General of the Franciscan Order Zacharia a Viculis asked Kraljeviƒá to root out the existing misconduct. In 1853, Kraljeviƒá issued a schematism of the Franciscan Province of Herzegovina in Dubrovnik. His first three-year term ended on 1 April 1856, when he was succeeded by Ilija Vido≈°eviƒá, to whom he served as a secretary during his entire tenure. After finishing his three-year term as custos, Kraljeviƒá also lectured the seminarians of the ≈†iroki Brijeg Franciscan Monastery. As he didn't have a textbook in Latin, he made his own grammar, which he used to lecture. When in September 1856, Ilija Vido≈°eviƒá had to make his first official visits, he authorised Kraljeviƒá to visit some locations he couldn't due to illness. In 1856, on request of the Governor of the Sanjak of Herzegovina Ishak-pasha, Bishop Rafael recommended Kraljeviƒá to represent the Catholics in the Idar Majlis of Mostar. In 1859, due to lack of priests, Kraljeviƒá was once again appointed a parson in Veljaci, where he served for a year, organising the education of illiterate adults and children. In November 1859 he asked the Propaganda to issue his work Spiritual Conversations (Razgovori duhovni). The Propaganda sent the work to Bernardino Trionfetti, General of the Franciscan Order, to find someone who speaks Croatian in order to evaluate whether the work is worth publishing. Kraljeviƒá's fellow Franciscan Pa≈°kal Buconjiƒá was lecturing in Rome at the time, and gave a positive opinion to Trionfetti, who ordered the work to be published in 1860. In May 1859, Vido≈°eviƒá was elected for a second term as custos, and after one of his definitors Pa≈°kal Kvesiƒá died in March 1860, Kraljeviƒá was elected to succeed him as definitor on 19 May 1860. At the same time, he was elected a guardian of the ≈†iroki Brijeg Franciscan monastery, a position he held until 23 April 1861, when he was succeeded by Filip Anƒçiƒá. Kraljeviƒá began his second term as custos after being elected on 23 April 1862. He went to general chapter of the Franciscan Order held in Assisi in June 1862. He returned from Italy in September. As custos, he oversaw the end of the construction of the Franciscan monastery in ≈†iroki Brijeg, expanded the monastic land, bought vineyard, and a mill. He also opened six shops near the monastery, and leased them. After the Propaganda published his Spiritual Conversations, he also asked for his grammar to be published as well, which was done in 1863, under the title Grammatica latino-illyrica (Latin-Illyrian grammar).  Apostolic Vicar  After Apostolic Vicar Bishop Rafel Bari≈°iƒá died on 14 August 1863, a temprary administration of the Apostolic Vicariate of Herzegovina was given to Anƒëeo Kraljeviƒá on 25 September 1863. He was named Apostolic Vicar of Herzegovina and a Titular Bishop of Motella the next year, on 9 December 1864. He was consecrated in Zadar by Petar Dujam Maupas on 25 March 1865. After his consecration, Kraljeviƒá arrived in Istanbul on 9 May 1865. There he presented a letter to Grand Vizier Mehmed Emin √Çli Pasha and chief military commander in Bosnia and Herzegovina Omar Pasha. In both letters, Kraljeviƒá described the hardships of the Herzegovinian Catholics. He asked for the tax to be based on the property value and not on the number of inhabitants, regulation of the relations between serfs and feudal lords, prevention of the land seizure from peasants. He also asked the Ottoman government to recognise him as head of the Catholics in Herzegovina so he could participate in the local government and thus resolve issues that concern the Catholics and that the lands, bought by Bishop Rafael Bari≈°iƒá, be registered as the property of the Catholic Church. The Grand Vizier granted him his requests. After returning to ≈†iroki Brijeg in March 1865, he asked the Franciscans to find him a temporary replacement as custos, until the new election. He was replaced by Andrija Karaƒçiƒá on 8 March 1865. He was finally installed as apostolic vicar on 13 June 1865. During the official ceremony, he was greeted by the Ottoman military and civil authorities, along with the consuls of the European powers and many of the faithful Catholics, and members of other religions. It was for the first time since the Ottoman occupation, that the authorities greeted a Catholic bishop. On 2 July 1868, Pope Pius IX named him Assistant to the Papal throne. Bishop Anƒëeo started the construction of the cathedral church, initiated by Bishop Rafael. On 7 March 1866, he blessed the cornerstone of the church, which was finally built in 1872, when the bishop consecrated it to the apostles Peter and Paul. Thus the seat of the vicariate was moved from Vukodol to the new church. The next year, 1873, the parish residence was built next to it. Kraljeviƒá also wrote his sermons. After he went to the First Vatican Council, he brought with him his sermons, and asked the Propaganda to publish them, which was approved in 1870, under the title Govorenja za svetkovine (Speeches during festivities). In order to avoid asking the Propaganda constantly to publish his books, he supported the idea of Fr. Franjo Miliƒáeviƒá about the establishment of a new printing office in Mostar. The equipment was bought in Vienna, and brought to a school Vukodol. The new printing office operated from September 1872, under the name Typographia Missionis catholicae in Hercegovina (Printing office of the Catholic mission in Herzegovina). Three years after its establishment, Bishop Anƒëeo decided to close down the printing office. However, Fr. Franjo Miliƒáeviƒá disagreed with the decision and relocated the printing office. = Herzegovina uprising = In April 1875, Austrian-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph visited Dalmatia, where he received two Franciscan delegations in Imotski on 24 April and in Vrgorac the next day. The Franciscans emphasised that Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to Austria-Hungary. In 1875, the Christians of Herzegovina, of whom majority Eastern Orthodox, started an uprising against the Ottoman authorities. One of the leaders of the uprising was Fr. Ivan Musiƒá, who led the Catholics in Gabela, was also Bishop Anƒëeo's nephew. Bishop Anƒëeo Kraljeviƒá called the Catholics of Gabela for peace. On 19 February 1876, he guaranteed to the Ottoman sultan, the European public, and the Holy See, that the Catholics hadn't taken part in the uprising. For this, he was decorated by the sultan. Bishop Anƒëeo went to Catholic villages, dissuading Catholics from participating in the uprising. Bishop Ivan Zaffron of Dubrovnik even anathematised the Catholics who joined the uprising. Thanks to the efforts of Kraljeviƒá, there was no uprising on the territory of the Herzegovinian Vicariate. After finding that Serbia requested the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Ottoman Empire, Bishop Anƒëeo wrote to the Austrian-Hungarian authorities in Sommer of 1876, not to allow this, stating that if the Ottoman authorities must leave, then Bosnia and Herzegovina should be annexed by Austria-Hungary, to whom the Catholics are connected by their \\"historical past, and many other moral and material interests\\". = Austrian- Hungarian occupation = Bishop Anƒëeo entered into a conflict with the Franciscan Province of Herzegovina, due to the Franciscans controlling all of the parishes in Herzegovina, while Bishop Anƒëeo, even though a Franciscan himself, wanted to have diocesan clergy at his disposal. In 1878, he wrote to the nuncio in Vienna about the necessity of the introduction of the diocesan clergy in the vicariate because the head of the Franciscan Province had all authority, with the apostolic vicar being only a figurehead that confirms his decisions. He also asked him to lobby with the Holy See to establish a diocese so he can found new parishes that will be controlled by the diocesan clergy, with the Franciscans retaining the rest of parishes. The Franciscans of Herzegovina were on bad terms with the Bishop Anƒëeo, claiming he didn't give them enough of the collected alms for the construction of the monastery in Humac. An anonymous letter was sent to Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria- Hungary, claiming the bishop is giving donations sent to him by Austria- Hungary to the Ottomans and accused him of being a turkophile. The Franciscan Custody barred itself from this letter. In February 1877, Bishop Anƒëeo requested from the Propaganda to send an apostolic visitor in Herzegovina and accused Pa≈°kal Buconjiƒá, at the time guardian of the Humac monastery, of negligence towards the parishes and the Herzegovinian Franciscans of taking the payment for maintenance by force from the believers during the Easter Communion. The Congregation named Bishop Casimir Forlani the apostolic visitor, and he arrived in Mostar in February the next year. Forlani finished the report in May 1878, and advised Bishop to act in agreement with the Franciscans and to record revenues and expenditures, as well as to help the construction of the monastery in Humac. The question of the parishes remained unresolved. Bishop Anƒëeo died of stroke on 27 July 1879 while on a chrismian visitation in Konjic. He was buried in Musala, a local cemetery, from where his remains were transferred to the local parish church.

Only one gold item is known to survive, a dress- fastener or terminal, currently held at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. History Eugene O'Curry speculated that the Bog was originally a wooded valley, used by goldsmiths due to its proximity to sources of wood for charcoal, as well as possibly a goldmine. He connected it with the ancient Cerdraigi, a Gaelic tribe whose name derives from cerd, an Old Irish term for a skilled craftsman, especially a worker in gold and silver. He also note the townland of Ballynagard located to the west: in Irish Baile na gCeard, \\"settlement of the goldsmiths.\\" Their placement in the bog is possibly a form of ritual deposition.

Four of her six siblings were also professional artists. They were all born in Leeds, and almost all of them later moved to London. Biography Wright was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, England, on 5 September 1863, and baptised in Holbeck Parish, Leeds, on 7 October 1863. She is sometimes confused with the Louise Wright (b. 1875 Philadelphia, USA) who married John W. Wright (18571933), the watercolourist and etcher. Wright's father was George Edward Wright (24 February 183411 November 1916), an accountant and Elizabeth Scott (c. 184031 May 1916), the daughter or Thomas Scott (born c. 1804), variously a railway engineer and a commission agent. George Edward and Elizabeth had married on 22 August 1859 in St' Jude's Church at Hunslet, Leeds, Yorkshire, England. George Edward Wright and Elizabeth Scott had seven children, five of whom were professional artists: *George Wright, (30 June 186011 March 1944) a noted painter of hunting and coaching scenes. *Louise Wright, the subject of this article. *Mabel Wright, born on 26 May 1867. One of only two siblings who were not professional artists. *Ethel Wright, born 11 October 1870, was the second of the sibling who was not a professional artist. She was living with her sisteres at 131 Woodham lane in September 1939. *Constance Wright (5 March 1877second quarter of 1973), described as a fashion artist in the 1911 census. *Philip Wright, (c. 2 February 187811 July 1926), described as a fashion artist in the 1901 and the 1911 census. *Gilbert Scott Wright, (24 July 18801958), an artist who worked with his brother George in his early years and also painted sporting and coaching scenes. He served as executor for his brother Philip, and for his parents. Wright seems never to have married. She was living at 131 Woodham Lane, Addlestone, Surrey at the time of the 1939 Register, at the house of her sister and brother-in-law, together with her sisters Ethel and Mabel. It is not clear when she died. The most likely record in the UK Death Index is a Louise Wright whose death was registered in North Surrey in the first quarter of 1944, aged 79. Louise would have been aged 80 at the time, but errors in such dates are not exceptional, especially as Louise's notional year of birth from Census data was 1868. Work Wright, like the rest of her family, had no formal training in art, and their abilities developed entirely on their professional needs. As a little girl. Wright spent most of her playtime designing dresses for her dolls. In 1891 the family were living at 6 Chestnut Ave, Headingley, in Leeds. However, there was little future there for the fashion illustrators in the family and the family moved to London. In 1901 the Family were living at 33 St. German's Road, Forest Hill, London. By 1911, Wright was living at Kirklees, 99 Honor Oak Park, with her parents, and her siblings Constance and Gilbert Scott. Wright's first fashion work offered for sale was a series of watercolour designs for display in the windows of women's dress shops. This gained her an appointment as a designer for a costumier and soon after was offered commissions by Alfred Vivian Mansell & Co. for whom she produced her first fashion catalogue. Soon she was so busy that her brother Gilbert Scott Wright had to come to her assistance, and soon the whole family was engaged in fashion drawing. Wright spent a year as the chief staff artist for Queen for a year. =Example of her work= The following illustrations are from The Art of the Illustrator. The first stage drawing is very faint as it was done in soft pencil and the ink may have faded over time.

The portfolio contained: a brief biography of Wright, an illustration of Wright at work in her studio, a sample of Wright's signature, an explanation of Wright's method of working-up the attached plates. The final plate showing an illustration typical of her work and five other plates showed the work at five earlier stages of its production, from the first rough to the just before the finished drawing or colour sketch. Wright's illustration is shown in the example above. Bradshaw said that that Louise and her siblings Wrights started the vogue for the beautifully illustrated Fashion Catalogues which have been issued by drapers, costumiers, tailors, etc., in recent years. and that this work kept the family perpetually busy. He further said that Wright had been responsible for a great deal of the best Fashion work which has been produced in this country and that her work was known and appreciated by users of Fashion drawing everywhere.''

He has served as the Multnomah County District Attorney since August 2020. Originally set to begin his term on January 1, 2021, Governor Kate Brown appointed him to the job early, in August of 2020, to replace Rod Underhill, who retired in July. Personal Schmidt has two children and lives in Southeast Portland.  Career  = Early career = Schmidt graduated from Vassar College with a BA in Political Science in 2003. He then worked for two years in New Orleans for Teach For America, teaching social studies and coaching basketball. He then attended Lewis & Clark College, graduating with his Juris Doctor in 2008. He then became a Deputy District Attorney in Multnomah County, Oregon for six years, first under Mike Schrunk, who was the lead DA for 32 years. Schmidt left the DA's office and joined the Oregon House and Senate Judiciary Committees in 2013, then led the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission in 2015. = District Attorney = In 2020, Schmidt announced his plan to run for District Attorney in the May primary election. On May 19th, Schmidt beat challenger Ethan Knight, an assistant U.S. Attorney, in the nonpartisan race with 76.6% of the vote. Knight was endorsed by the incumbent Rod Underhill and the office's union, the Multnomah County Prosecuting Attorneys Association. Schmidt represents a progressive view towards prosecutions and criminal justice reform, preferring alternatives to prison, against trial as an adult for juveniles, for police accountability, against mandatory sentencing, and against the death penalty. Since a DA has the power to decide who to prosecute, his stance can influence local and statewide cases to counter what has been described the \\"irrationality of our system\\" of biased prosecution using data-driven outcomes. Days after the election results, on June 16, 2020, Rod Underhill resigned his position immediately, to the surprise of Schmidt. Underhill noted the changing environment with police violence, Black Lives Matter, and George Floyd protests. The Portland Mercury noted that Underhill's resignation was less than a week after the resignation of Portland Police Chief Jami Resch. With Underhill's encouragement, Governor Kate Brown appointed Schmidt to fill the seat on July 7, 2020. The following day, the president of Multnomah County Prosecuting Attorneys Association resigned in protest.  George Floyd protests  Days into his Schmidt's job on August 7, 2020, Daryl Turner, president of the Portland Police Association wrote an open letter to Mayor/police commissioner Ted Wheeler and Schmidt, calling their \\"operational direction\\" insane, describing examples of violence, and telling Wheeler to \\"Step up and do your job\\". Directing comments at Schmidt, he called police accountability \\"a thinly veiled threat to indict police officers\\", and again telling him to \\"Step up and do your job\\". Schmidt gained notoriety shortly after taking office for refusing to prosecute people who were arrested participating in the George Floyd protests unless there is \\"deliberate property damage, theft, or threat of force.\\" This meant dropping the majority of cases; by August 11, the office prosecuted 47 felonies out of 550 referred protest cases. 313 of 417 misdemeanors were for interfering with a peace officer, and 44 of 133 felonies were for riot, which in Oregon can be even be applied to a passive bystander in a group. He stated he was \\"recognizing the right to speak\\". A notable case where he dropped charges was against Demetria Hester, a leader in the Wall of Moms movement who had been assaulted in a hate crime the day prior to the assailant's 2017 Portland train attack. A police officer told Schmidt in a meeting that \\"I don‚Äôt trust anything you do or say because you‚Äôre antifa.\\" In addition to the open letter from PPA's Turner telling Schmidt to \\"do your job\\", Turner also stated Schmidt he was \\"George Soros-backed\\", though the union denied he said that. After the reactions, an activist described the law enforcement responses as \\"lashing out\\", and another described it as political spin. Schmidt noted the irony between his office dropping minor infractions to events where white supremacists and alt-right groups like Patriot Prayer were given a free pass for rioting, including violence against people and pointing loaded weapons. On September 4, 2020, Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson and a supporter sued Schmidt for an injunction over selective prosecution based on political beliefs. Both were given a felony riot charge for inciting a riot between Patriot Prayer and leftists gathering at Cider Riot in 2019. They are represented by James Buchal (Multnomah County GOP chair) and Derek Angus Lee; Oregon district court judge Karin Immergut has the case, as of September 17, 2020.

There is not too much known about the Gwineas. Like other notable rocks around the Cornish coast, the Gwineas is always locally referred to as 'Gull Rock'. This may also be reflected in the name, if it has been made up from the Cornish words meaning 'white' and 'island'.  History  Originally the Gwineas were believed to be a hill surrounded by a forest. Over time this became an islet and then, eventually, an isolated rock as it is today.  Shipwrecks  While the visible Gwineas has been the site of several shipwrecks, the Yaw, a submerged rock to the east, has been the cause of more wrecks. Although the bell buoy is called 'Gwineas', it is there to mark the Yaw. As an eastern cardinal buoy, it flashes in groups of three, indicating that it is located to the east of the hazard. It is kept in place with four large anchors attached to chains, the flashing light is solar powered, and it is serviced at least once a year.Geoff Fox: former Auxiliary Coastguard, Gorran Haven = SS Ardangorm = On Thursday 4 January 1940, the SS Ardangorm, a 5,000 ton vessel, struck the Gwineas in an ESE gale at night when en route from Cardiff to Fowey in ballast. The Fowey lifeboat launched at 3.45am thirty five minutes after distress flares were seen. At daylight 11 crew were rescued by the lifeboat. This left 25 crew aboard. The lifeboat landed the 11 and requested assistance from tugs. In the afternoon, after an Admiralty tug had arrived, it was decided the ship could not be saved. The lifeboat took off the remaining crew and returned to Fowey at 4.18pm. The ship‚Äôs back broke on 10 January and wood and other material washed ashore to be salvaged by villagers. = Pallas = In 1895 the mainly steel-built Russian barque 'Pallas' was wrecked on Great Perhaver Beach after grounding on The Gwineas in an easterly gale. The vessel's cargo was timber and all the crew were rescued. A large amount of steel wreckage once survived in the shallows.

Margaret petitioned for divorce in 1937. Her petition was granted as the 1939 Register showed her marital status as divorced. Margaret died on 12 December 1957. She was living at 22 Grena Road, Richmond, Surrey at the time but dies at 26 Wolverton Avenue, Kingston upon Thames. Her estate was valued at ¬£3,265 18s. 5d. Her daughter was her executrix. Wright served as executor for his brother Philip, and for his parents. Most sources given 1958 as the year of death for Wright.. However, the only entry for a Gilbert S. Wright of the right age in the UK Death Index suggests that Wright died in the fourth quarter of 1959. Work Like the rest of his family, Wright had no formal training in art. He probably learned to paint from his brother George Wright who was twenty years his senior, in producing paintings of sporting and coaching scenes for calendars and other work. They collaborated until about 1925. In his early teens Wright fell under the influence of Samuel Edmund Waller, and at the age of 13 began to produce paintings of handsome Georgian gallants, many on horseback, either courting or eloping with their lady loves. In 1900 he exhibited How he won the VC7 at the Royal Academy. The painting was soon purchased by a print publisher, and this led to many commissions. Wright produced illustrations for a number of publications including a two page spread of a Lion in the Path for the The Graphic in 1910, a two-page colour hunting illustration for the Illustrated London News in 1913, a colour illustration for The Bystander in 1930. He also produced prints for sale. Wright produced postcards for James Henderson, for whom Wright painted horses heads, M. Munk, and Tuck, for whom Wright painted a whole series of sets of cards including: *A Hunting Morning *A Hunting we will go *British Sports *Christmas coaching *Christmas old style with Dickens quotes *Christmas rural insets *Coaching: Series I *Coaching: Series II *Fox Hunting *Hunting Wright also did some book illustration, normally in full colour. He illustrated the Children's Dickens with eight colour full-page plates. Wright was a regular contributor to the Christmas post cards for the Royal Family. He painted the card for the Prince of Wales in both 1928 and 1931, and for the Duke and Duchess of York in both 1930 and 1935. =Example of book illustration by Wright= In 1909, Wright provide eight full page illustrations for The Children's Dickens: Stories selected from various tale (1909) London: Henry Frowde and Hodder and Stoughton. There was also a colour illustration pasted to the front boards. Abe Books shows two different versions of this illustration, and it may be that Wright produced these as well as the eight full page illustration in the book.

He is known for his extended expedition through the Uele River basin and onward towards the Nile, during which he cleared the Arab slave traders from the region and established a Belgian presence. He died in an accident before reaching the Nile. Early years (1853‚Äì1883) Willem Frans Van Kerckhoven was born in Mechelen, Belgium, on 28 January 1853. His parents were Frans Van Kerckhoven and Jeanne-Catherine Miller. On 22 February 1869 he enlisted in the 6th line regiment. He was named second lieutenant in the 3rd line regiment on 17 April 1875. On 29 August 1878 he was admitted to the War College. On 21 February 1883, as a deputy staff lieutenant, he was seconded to the Military Cartographic Institute for service in the Congo. First Congo term: Bas Congo and Bangalas (1883‚Äì1886) Van Kerckhoven left Liverpool on 7 March 1883 on the steamer Biafra, bound for the Congo. At Vivi on 24 April 1883 he was entrusted with transporting some material for the artillery to the upper Congo River. Henri Avaert was in command of the post in Isangila, which was to be the base for the Niari-Kwilu expedition led by Edmond Hanssens. Avaert's health was poor, and on 16 August 1883 he was replaced by Van Kerckhoven. Due to his energy and capability Van Kerckhoven was assigned various missions including purchase of land in Bas- Congo, recruitment of krooboys in Liberia and a 3-month exploration of the territory to the right of the Congo between Manyanga and Brazzaville. Guillaume Casman arrived in the Congo in January 1884, traveled up the right bank of the Congo to Mukumbi's huts which he reached on 19 February 1884. On 3 August 1884 he was visited there by Lieutenant Van Kerckhoven who had been relieved of his command at Isangila and was concluding treaties with the tribes around Mukumbi. Van Kerckhoven passed through L√©opoldville in April 1885, and was sent to succeed Camille Coquilhat in command of the Bangalas station, which he reached on 7 August 1885. The post had few soldiers and its position on the river bank was precarious. It was attacked by the local people, whom he managed to repel, and he strengthened the palisades. He managed to gain the support of the Iboko and Mabali chiefs. He began agricultural work, and the local Bangala people gradually began to help with this. Van Kerckhoven had gained enough confidence from the Bangalas that by the next year he was able to send a strong contingent of Bangala soldiers to L√©opoldville. Ten of them went down to Bomo to become the first Africans in the Force Publique, and later another 75 went down. Camille Van den Plas was responsible for leading the first contingent of 84 Bangala soldiers, with 11 women to Boma. Van Kerckhoven also sent a contingent to the Falls under his deputy Walter Deane to defend the post there, which was in danger of falling to Tippu Tip's Arabs. They did not succeed, and Deane and Dubois were forced to withdraw on 28 August 1886. Van Kerckhoven had left Bangalas by then. On 8 June 1886 he embarked in Boma to return to Europe at the end of his term of service. Bangalas District (1886‚Äì1890) Van Kerckhoven applied for a second term, and in December 1886 passed through Lisbon on the Cabo Verde. He had been appointed district commissioner of L√©opoldville. This base was well organized and required little attention. He was sent to organize and expand the territory around the Bangalas station that had recently been taken over by the state. In December 1888 he was appointed district commissioner 1st class. With the help of Ernest Baert and Francis Dhanis he began a large expansion in the region of rice, coffee and cocoa cultivation, built the first brick buildings and created new government posts. Jules Alexandre Milz arrived in Boma on 25 July 1888 and was assigned to the Bangalas District, where Van Kerckhoven was preparing for the L√©on Roget expedition to the north. The task was to establish entrenched camps on the Aruwimi River for defense against Arab slavers. Always on the move on the small steamer Association Internationale Africaine, Van Kerckhoven was the first European to ascend the Itimbiri River. He founded posts as far as the mouth of the Aruwimi, some headed by his deputies and some with small African garrisons. Van Kerckhoven was able to sign treaties with the local people throughout the territory, and to put an end to the influence of the Arabs. thumb Van Kerckhoven came to the aid of the rearguard of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition under Major Edmund Musgrave Barttelot, in Yambuya on the Aruwimi, and gave it supplies so it could continue its journey. Van Kerckhoven met Tippu Tip in 1888, following which 400 porters were supplied for Barttelot. In his report to the governor general Van Kerckhoven recommended temporizing with the Arabs, but making every effort to prevent them from conquering territory upstream from the Bangalas, including a fortified camp at the mouth of the Aruwimi. In 1889 he supervised construction of this camp at Basoko. Later he accompanied Governor General Janssens to the Falls, where he acted as a mediator in the discussions. After this trip he returned via L√©opoldville and Boma to Belgium, where he arrived on 2 January 1890. Nile expedition (1890‚Äì1892) =Preparation= At the time of Van Kerckhoven's Congo-Nile expedition, Arab slavers had occupied the Falls and were advancing northwest from there towards Djabir on the Uele River. King L√©opold II had ordered Captain Roget to establish an entrenched fortification in Basoko, at the mouth of the Aruwimi, and from there to extend a line of protective post north. Roget and Milz had founded the Ibembo station on the Itimbiri, then had reached the Uele in Djabir at about the same time that Alphonse van G√®le had sailed up the Ubangi River to Yakoma, downstream from Djabir. They had been unable to meet up, however, and Roget had returned to Europe. L√©opold II now decided to send a strong expedition from the new bases to the Nile, blocking the north route to the Arabs and opening up a region that was still largely unexplored by Europeans since Wilhelm Junker's visit in 1871. Van Kerchhoven, now a captain-commandant, was named inspector of state and given command of the expedition. The force of about 500 well-armed African troops with artillery included 14 European officers and non-commissioned officers, two doctors, two clerks and three interpreters. =Journey to Djabir= Semio, Sultan of the Asande Avungura. Water-colour by E. M. Heims, 1911 Van Kerckhoven reached Boma on 2 December 1890 and led the main body of troops to the concentration point at the Bumba River, a little downstream from the Itimbiri. Van Kerckhoven met Milz at Stanley Pool in March 1891. Milz's term was over, but agreed to accompany Van Kerckhoven back to the Uele as second in command of his expedition to the Nile. The expedition left L√©opoldville on 4 February 1891. The vanguard under Captain Pierre Ponthier was sent by land to Djabir. Along the way he was attacked by Arabs supported by local people, who badly slowed his progress. Van Kerckhoven made a short visit to the Falls to try to allay the fears of the Arab Rachid, then took the bulk of his men to Djabir. At Ibembo he sent Milz to the Mbomou River to make every effort to gain the allegiance of Sultan Semio, who had been dealing with the Arab bands. At the start of July most of the Van Kerckhoven expedition had gathered in Djabir. =Djabir to Bomokandi= On 8 July the vanguard, still under Pontier, began the march east through uncharted territory along the Uele. He established relay stations at points on both banks of the river with relatively little opposition from the local people or Arab slavers. He reached Bima and then the mouth of the Bomokandi River, where he established himself solidly. Van Kerckhoven had a more difficult journey. At the start, he had a fight with slavers who were defeated after reinforcements were supplied by Adh√©mar Daenen. Then he was attacked by the Ababuas along the river, and again had to call for help by Daenen, who met him with 40 men at the Bima. Before going further Ponthier, with the approval of Van Kerckhoven, had to clear the country of Arabs. They had settled on the Makongo and on islands in the Bomokandi. He defeated them in some sharp engagements, helped by local people who could no longer tolerate the slavers. Van Kerckhoven also obtained political and military support from the local chiefs on the Mbomou. Lieutenant de la K√©thulle was sent to Rafa√Ø in southern Darfur, and Lieutenant Foulon created a post in Sultan Sassa's territory. Milz sent Van Kerckhoven a message on 25 November announcing that Semio was now an ally, and on 25 November Milz and Semo arrived at Bomokandi camp with 600 soldiers and 500 porters. =Bomokandi to Niangara= Orders were given for the march to the Nile. Ponthier, Semio and his soldiers would go by land, while Milz would accompany Van Kerckhoven with the provisions by water. The columns left on 12 December 1891 and rejoined at Amadi on 22 December, where they started to build a post. The land force went through swampy country, covered with grassy hills along the ridge that separates the Uele and Bomokandi basins. The local people were not hostile, and when the Barambo chief found the expedition was not an Arab band he entered into an alliance and let Captain Daenen establish a station. The column led by Van Kerckhoven and Milz reached the location of Amadi on 22 December 1891 where they started to build a post. A column led by Milz traveled by land along the south bank of the Uele selecting sites for new posts, and reached the confluence of the Gada River with the Uele on 18 March 1892, where they chose to build a new station at the village of Mbegu, named Niangara. Van Kerckhoven arrived there on 25 March 1892, and Jean-Hubert Cloesen was placed in charge of the post. Azande, or \\"Niam-Niam\\", warriors of the Bomokandi region, showing off in Manziga's village, near Niangara On 30 December 1891 Van Kerckhoven, Milz, Ponthier and others left Amadi and headed south. They were at the Mbe-Bomokandi confluence on 1 January 1892, where Ponthier fell sick and had to return via Djabir to Boma. After having obtained the submission of the main chiefs of the region, who had given them enough canoes, the expedition returned to Amadis on 24 January and moved out on 29 January. The flotilla was on the Bomokandi on 2 February 1892. Milz, Gustave Gustin, Cl√©ment-Fran√ßois Vande Vliet and Semio, who had traveled by land along the south bank of the Uele, were attacked by the . They continued, making contact with the local chiefs and selecting sites for new posts, and reached the confluence of the Gada River with the Uele on 18 March, where they chose to build a new station at the village of Mbegu, named Niangara. Van Kerckhoven arrived there on 25 March 1892, and Jean-Hubert Cloesen was placed in charge of the post. =Onward from Niangara= Village of the Logo people On April 7 the vanguard continued its march. It was led by Gustin, with four Europeans, 250 soldiers, and Semio with his force. It left Van Kerckhoven, who was bedridden, behind in Niangara. He was suffering from haematuric fever, and was unable to leave until 18 April 1892. He reached the Kibali-Dungu confluence on 28 April 1892, and on 28 April 1892 reached the Mbittima z√©riba, at 29¬∞E on the south bank of the Kibali. There he received the submission of Wanfo, an old vongar chief. On 6 June Van Kerckhoven, Milz, Montangie and Vande Vliet left Mbittima by canoe. On 10 June 1892 they reached Surur at the confluence of the Kibali and the Nzoro River, and decided to ascend the Nzoro. The country became mountainous. Although the Nzoro was wide, only short sections were navigable, interrupted by falls and rapids that often extended for several kilometres. There were some skirmishes with the Logos of the north of the Nzoro. The leading column under Gustin and Semio lost contact with the rear column on 300 men under Van Kerckhoven, Milz, Montangie and Van de Vliet. Gustin and Semio often had to fight, and found the local people had destroyed all food supplies. Supplies and porterage presented problems to Van Kerckhoven's main column. It was divided, leaving 200 of the less able-bodied men at the foot of the rapids, while the others went ahead in search of the Gustin-Semio advance guard. Some of the baggage had to be returned to Mbittima, and the column had to force its way through. On 11 July Van Kerckhoven and Milz left by land along the south bank of the Nzoro through difficult country, with the soldiers carrying their loads for lack of porters. They reached Tagomolanghi on 25 July 1892. On 2 August 1892, short of food, the expedition pushed on towards the Kibbi, which was said to be close to Wadelai, near the Nile. After the expedition passed the headwaters of the Kibbi and left the Uele basin. Supplies of food were found, and the column pushed on to the east. On 9 August 1892 they were about south of Mount Beka on the Congo-Nile watershed, near Mount Wati. Kerckhoven died in Djebel Watti on 10 August 1892. On that day the column was attacked by local people at daybreak. During the skirmish the boy who carried Van Kerckhoven's rifle accidentally fired it while reloading, and shot Van Kerckhoven in the back at level of his heart. He died almost immediately. Van Kerckhoven was buried there and Milz took command. He continued to the Nile, and reached the final goal of the journey in Wadelai on 4 October 1892. Legacy A governor general of the Congo described Van Kerckhoven as \\"a hurricane which passed through the countryside leaving nothing but devastation behind it.\\" In 1887 Van Kerckhoven told a fellow passenger on a steamboat, Roger Casement, that he paid his African soldiers a small fee for every rebel head they bought him after a battle, \\"to stimulate their prowess in the face of the enemy.\\" Casement later became known for exposing the brutal regime in the Congo Free State. He was a close friend of Joseph Conrad, and his account may have influenced Conrad's depiction of Kurtz in his Heart of Darkness. The Uele-Nile expedition confiscated ivory worth hundreds of thousands of francs, for which it became notorious, and killed about 1,800 men. The subsequent \\"Arab Wars\\" that lasted until 1894 were in part due to its actions. However, the historian Albert Chapaux considered that Van Kerckhoven was among the leading figure in the development of the Congo Free State.

Both husband and wife choose his brother Gilbert Scott Wright as an executor. Work The details of his early working life are not known. Like the rest of his family, he had no formal training in art, but had to learn as he progressed. However, as he left a large number of oil canvasses from his early period painted en Grisaille it is assumed that he was doing a lot of illustration work. Wright was known for painting strong and well-finished hunting and coaching scenes, and for his horse portraits. From 1901, when he moved to Rugby, he began to paint polo matches as well. From 1925 he was under commission from both by 1925 was under commission to Ackermanns in the U.K. and Grand Central Galleries in New York. These were major publishers of prints.

Preceded by The Magnificent Defeat, it is the second in a series of sermon anthologies preached in 1959 during the author's time at the Phillips Exeter Academy. The Hungering Dark is Buechner's second non-fiction publication, and it was published by Seabury Press, NY, in 1968.  Composition  Buechner delivered the sermons anthologised in both The Magnificent Defeat and The Hungering Dark as the ‚Äònew school minister‚Äô and head of Theology at the Phillips Exeter Academy. The author writes in his autobiographical work, Now and Then (1983), of the challenges of preparing and delivering sermons for a young and unreceptive audience, many of whom were present in chapel ‚Äòagainst both their wills and their principles‚Äô.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 67. In a later sermon anthology, Secrets in the Dark (2006), Buechner writes that the majority of his students, ‚Äòin keeping with the spirit of the time‚Äô, were ‚Äòagainst almost everything ‚Äì the Vietnam war, the government, anybody over thirty including their parents, the school, and especially religion.‚ÄôBuechner, Frederick (2006). Secrets in the Dark: a life in sermons. New York: HarperOne. pp. xiii. In Now and Then, the author remembers the feeling of ‚Äòsheer terror‚Äô he felt before preaching in front of both his students and fellow faculty members; regarding the latter, he writes that his colleagues were ‚Äòoften jaded, skeptical, sometimes even quite openly negative about the whole religious enterprise.‚Äô Concerning the effect of regularly having to preach to such a hostile audience, Marjorie Casebier McCoy suggests that the experience forced the author to ‚Äòhone his preaching and literary skills to their utmost in order to get a hearing for the Christian faith.‚ÄôMcCoy, Marjorie Casebier (1988). Frederick Buechner: Novelist and Theologian of the Lost and Found. New York: Harper & Row. Reflecting on his perception of the role of the preacher in such a context, Buechner draws on Friedrich Schleiermacher in suggesting that his ‚Äòjob‚Äô was to ‚Äòdefend the Christian faith against its ‚Äúcultured despisers‚Äù [...], to present the faith as appealingly, honestly, relevantly, and skillfully as I could‚Äô.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 47. The volume is dedicated ‚ÄòTo my former students and colleagues at the Phillips Exeter Academy.‚Äô  Major themes  As in The Magnificent Defeat, the subject of Buechner's sermons in The Hungering Dark offer meditations on a broad selection of texts from the Old and New testaments. In Now and Then, Buechner reveals the influence of Karl Barth‚Äôs essay, ‚ÄòThe Need for Christian Preaching‚Äô, on both the sermons in his first two anthologies, but also on his later preaching. ‚ÄòThese words of Barth‚Äôs were extremely powerful words to me‚Äô, he writes: ‚Äò[they] seemed extremely honest and, as far as I could tell, extremely true; and in my preaching at Exeter and ever since I have been guided by them.‚ÄôBuechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 70. As with much of Buechner's work, the sermons anthologised in The Hungering Dark touch upon the themes of faith, doubt, and the presence of God in ordinary moments and stories. Concerning the meditations in both The Magnificent Defeat and The Hungering Dark, the author writes: ‚ÄòI have never assumed that the people I talk to are so certain it is true that the question is not still very much alive for them. [‚Ä¶] I assume always that they want to know if it is true as much as I do myself.‚Äô  References  Category:American anthologies Category:Essay collections Category:Sermons Category:Books about Christianity Category:1968 non-fiction books ","title":"The Hungering Dark"},{"id":"65296548","text":"Manuel Sagarzazu (born 15 October 1903, date of death unknown) was a Spanish footballer.

Life Paolo Bisanti was born in Kotor in 1529 to a local noble family: his uncle Trifone had been bishop of that town till 1540. Luca, Paolo's older brother, became bishop of Kotor after the uncle, and, as usual among the poor bishops, Luca entered in service to the Grimani family and served as Vicar of the Patriarchate of Aquileia between 1547 and 1556. Paolo graduated in utroque iure in Padova, and when back in Kotor he was encharged of local politic duties. His brother Luca resigned the bishopric in his favour, and Paolo was so appointed Bishop of Kotor on 12 October 1565. He was examined by the Archbishop of Dubrovnik Crisostomo Calvino and confirmed in the appointment. In 1578 he resigned the bishopric and was appointed by Vicar of the Patriarchate of Aquileia. The Patriarch of Aquileia used to live in Venice, while Paolo lived in Udine having the full responsibility of the local government. The Patriarchate of Aquileia covered not only regions in the Venetian Republic but other territories were under the Habsburg Empire, and that was the cause of strong clashes with the House of Habsburg. However thank to his diplomatic skills he succeeded in 1581 to enter in Carniola, Styria and Carinthia and in 1583 in Burgenland and Gorizia (part of the Patriarchate of Aquileia) to perform his pastoral visit as requested by the Council of Trent. The Patriarchate of Aquileia bordered with territories with a presence of Protestants, so Paolo Bisanti was particularly active in implementing the measures of the Council of Trent, and in reforming the clergy. According to J. Gruden, his 1581 pastoral visit marked the beginning of the Catholic resistance against the onslaught of Protestantism in Slovenia. He was author of several Latin treatises in the field of ecclesiastical law. In 1584 he summoned a synod in Udine. After the appoinment of Francesco Barbaro as coadjutor of the Patriarch, the office of Bisanti lost importance. He died in Udine on 4 March 1587.

Created by Dontnod Entertainment, the series debuted with the eponymous first installment, which released episodically in five installments across 2015. It was followed by a prequel, Life Is Strange: Before the Storm, which was developed by Deck Nine and released in three episodes across 2017. Life Is Strange 2, a sequel to the original game, was once again developed by Dontnod and released in five episodes between 2018 and 2019.  History  Following the critical and commercial failure of their 2013 action-adventure game Remember Me, French game developer Dontnod Entertainment was forced to restructure and reinvent themselves. Dontnod CEO Oskar Guilbert explained \\"Before, what we wanted to do was make big games with large teams and long production cycles... So we had to change that, do something smaller with smaller teams. We didn‚Äôt want to do just a small game; we also wanted to bring something new to the market.\\" Life Is Strange was conceived around the rewind mechanic, a concept which had already been briefly explored in Remember Me. The protagonist of the first game, Max Caulfield, was created with the ability to rewind time to supplement this mechanism. Development began in April 2013 with a team of 15 people, with further people added as the collaboration with Square Enix began. Before signing with Square Enix, Dontnod imagined Life Is Strange as a full-length video game similar to Remember Me that Dontnod would self-publish; however, Square Enix realised it would be more successful as an episodic title, both for creative reasons, financial restrictions and marketing purposes. This allowed them to tell the story at a slower pace. Development began under the working title What If, before being retitled to avoid confusion with the film of the same name. It was Dontnod's second title with a female protagonist, and most prospective publishers were unwilling to publish a game unless it had a male protagonist. Guilbert also challenged the idea at the start. Dontnod Creative Director Jean-Maxime Moris explained that Square Enix was the only publisher with no intention to change this. \\"Square [Enix] is basically the only publisher who didn't want to change anything about the game... we had other publishers telling us to make it a male lead character, and Square didn't even question that once.\\" For the first game, the Pacific Northwest was chosen for the setting to convey a nostalgic and autumnal feel, with the team eventually settling on Oregon as the location of the fictional town of Arcadia Bay. It was decided early on that most of the budget be spent on the writing and voice actors. The story was originally written in French by Jean-Luc Cano, and converted into a game script by the game's co-directors and design team. This was then handed over to Christian Divine and Cano to be fine tuned in English. Recording sessions were done in Los Angeles, California, with the French developer brought in via Skype. The textures seen in the game were entirely hand painted, adapted to achieve what art director Michel Koch called \\"impressionistic rendering\\". Sources of inspiration include the visual novel Danganronpa, in terms of balancing gameplay and story, and the novel The Catcher in the Rye, whose protagonist Holden Caulfield shares a surname with Max, the first game's lead character. For the sake of realism, the supernatural elements were designed as a metaphor for the characters' inner conflict, and experts were consulted to tackle difficult subjects such as teen suicide. Following the release and rapid success of the first Life is Strange, publisher Square Enix chose American developer Deck Nine to develop a prequel game focusing on the life of Chloe Price, while the Dontnod team began developing a direct sequel. Development on the project began in 2016 with assistance from Square Enix' London Studios. Ashly Burch, who voiced Chloe in Life Is Strange, was replaced by Rhianna DeVries due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. However, Burch and Hannah Telle, who voiced Max Caulfield, both reprised their roles for the bonus episode Farewell. The project went under various working titles during development. The writers researched memoirs and psychology to understand Chloe's grieving process, and the script for the game was over 1,500 pages, written by lead writer Zak Garriss and a writers' room. Prior to its official announcement, images had leaked online indicating that a prequel to Life Is Strange was in development. Square Enix revealed Life Is Strange: Before the Storm on 11 June during their E3 2017 presentation. Dontnod had decided early on that prospective follow-ups to Life Is Strange would feature new characters and locations to the original, with the developers feeling that Max and Chloe's story had run its course over the first two games. Game Co-Director Raoul Barbet explained that \\"It‚Äôs a question we asked ourselves at the beginning. Is it Max and Chloe, Arcadia Bay? No, it‚Äôs about everyday characters, relatable characters with stories you can involve yourself in, because it reflects your own experiences. With some supernatural stuff on the top.‚Äù Michel Koch added that ‚Äúeveryone loved Max, Chloe, Rachel... But [their story]...it's done. We have nothing more to tell. We don't want to. Other people will do it, and it's okay... But for us, we have nothing more to do. Take [them] and do whatever you want.\\" Development on Life Is Strange 2 began in early 2016 as the first game shipped its physical edition. Michel Koch and Raoul Barbet returned to direct the sequel, with Christian Divine and Jean-Luc Cano reprising their roles as co-writers. The concept was influenced by the photography of Mike Brodie, who would freighthop across the United States and take pictures of drifters. The game is structured like a road movie, inspired by the film Into the Wild and novella Of Mice and Men. Dontnod conducted field research on the West Coast of the United States, meeting people and taking pictures there. The two primary themes of the game are education and brotherhood. Using the Unreal Engine 4, they upgraded the animation system, physics, and shaders. According to Dontnod, one of the biggest challenges of development was the artificial intelligence of the character Daniel.  Gameplay  The Life Is Strange games are graphic adventures played from a third-person view. The player can examine and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving in the form of fetch quests and making changes to the environment. The player can explore locations and communicate with non-playable characters. Dialogue exchanges feature branching options in conversation. In some instances, choices in dialogue will alter and affect the story through short- or long-term consequences. For each one of the choices, something good in the short term could turn out worse later. Each individual game in the series features a central mechanic unique to that game. In Life is Strange, the player has access to a \\"rewind\\" ability, which allows them to rewind time and alter the course of events. The rewind mechanic is accessible in conversation, allowing players to navigate branching dialogue options and change the outcome of a conversation to be beneficial to the player. Items picked up are kept in the inventory after a rewind, and changes in the environment remain in place. In Before the Storm, Chloe has a \\"backtalk\\" mechanic that allows her to persuade and intimidate other characters through conversation, with either positive or negative effects. Life is Strange 2 is an exception in that the player themselves do not have access to the central mechanic; rather, the player (as Sean) must guide Daniel, who has the power of telekinesis, through various moral and ethical choices that will influence how he will use his powers to help or hinder the player as the game progresses.  Games  = Main Series =  Life Is Strange  Max Caulfield returns to her hometown of Arcadia Bay, Oregon, where she witnesses childhood friend Chloe Price being shot in the bathroom. The incident triggers Max's abilities to rewind time, allowing her to save Chloe from the gunman. Max begins to have visions of a violent storm approaching Arcadia Bay as she begins to use her powers to help Chloe locate her missing best friend Rachel Amber. Max and Chloe eventually learn Rachel was murdered by photographer Mark Jefferson and Max's wealthy classmate Nathan Prescott. As the storm hits Arcadia Bay, Max realises that to avert the devastation she must choose between saving Chloe or the entirety of Arcadia Bay. The game was released periodically across 2015 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows, with Android, MacOS, iOS and Linux versions released later on. Episode 1: Chrysalis was released on 30 January, Episode 2: Out Of Time on 24 March, Episode 3: Chaos Theory on 19 May, Episode 4: Dark Room on 28 July, and Episode 5: Polarized on 20 October. Retail editions of the complete season for Xbox One, PS4 and PC were released on 22 January 2016 in Europe, and 19 January 2016 in North America.  Life Is Strange: Before the Storm  Three years before the events of Life Is Strange, Chloe Price is struggling with the death of her father when she meets and befriends popular student Rachel Amber. As the two develop an intense friendship, they uncover long-buried secrets within the Amber family that lead Rachel on a search for her birth mother. The game was released periodically across 2017 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Microsoft Windows, with Android, MacOS, iOS and Linux versions following at a later date. Episode 1: Awake was released on 31 August, Episode 2: Brave New World on 19 October, and Episode 3: Hell Is Empty on 20 December. Retail editions of the complete season were released on 6 March, containing the bonus episode Farewell. Life Is Strange 2 Sean Diaz and his younger brother Daniel flee their home in Seattle following their father's death at the hands of a police officer; an event that awakens Daniel's latent telekenetic abilities and causes him to kill the officer. Now on the run from the law, the brothers embark on a cross- country roadtrip down America's Pacific Coast toward their father's homeland of Puerto Lobos, Mexico, as Sean struggles to step up as a father figure for Daniel and guide him through the moral implications of his new-found powers. As they meet friends and foes along the road, including their estranged mother, the decisions Sean makes shape who Daniel will become, and eventually the ultimate outcome of their journey. The game was released periodically in five episodes for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Microsoft Windows, with MacOS and Linux versions released shortly after the final episode. Episode 1: Roads was released on 27 September 2018. Episode 2: Rules was released on 24 January 2019. Episode 3: Wastelands was released on 9 May 2019. Episode 4: Faith was released on 22 August 2019. Episode 5: Wolves was released on 3 December 2019. Boxed editions of the complete season were released on 3 December 2019 in Europe, and 4 February 2020 in North America. Due to complaints about the large gaps between episode releases, Dontnod issued a statement saying \\"The Life Is Strange series is a project close to all of our hearts and one for which we do not want to rush development and thereby fail to meet the benchmark of quality and emotional impact that you, our players, deserve\\". = Bonus Episodes =  Farewell  Max struggles to tell Chloe of her imminent move to Seattle. To distract herself, she lets Chloe take them on a pirate treasure hunt in search of \\"treasure\\" buried by Chloe's father, William. Their day is ultimately cut short by the news of William's death. Farewell was released alongside retail editions for Life Is Strange: Before the Storm.  The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit  Chris Eriksen fashions himself into the superhero Captain Spirit to help his alcoholic father set up the house for Christmas. He imagines his various chores as supervillains to be defeated - including his arch-nemeis Mantroid, an embodiment of his feelings surrounding the death of his mother in a hit-and- run. After an argument with his father, Chris runs to his treehouse and falls, but is mysteriously saved by two boys watching from afar. The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit was released as a free demo for Life Is Strange 2, and takes place during the events of that game's second episode. = Future = During an interview with GameSpot, Raoul Barbet and Michel Koch both expressed interest in the future of the franchise, including a potential Life is Strange 3, but explained that the rights belong to Square Enix and that decisions on the future of the franchise lay with them. On the prospect of the games existing in a shared universe, Jean Luc Cano added ‚ÄúThe thing that I can tell you is for us the story of Max and Chloe in Life is Strange 1 is done, it‚Äôs told, and the story of Sean and Daniel is told in Life is Strange 2, so, maybe we can see them again one day.‚Äù  Other media  = Comics =  Life Is Strange: Dust  Following the events of Life is Strange's \\"Sacrifice Arcadia Bay\\" ending, Dust follows Max and Chloe as they come to terms with the aftermath of the storm and letting Arcadia Bay be destroyed. This graphic novel was published by Titan Comics beginning in November 2018. The comic is written by Emma Vieceli, with interior and cover art by Claudia Leonardi and colours by Andrea Izzo. = Novels =  Life Is Strange: Welcome to Blackwell Academy  Square Enix partnered with Titan Publishing on Life Is Strange: Welcome to Blackwell Academy, a 160-page book exploring the Life is Strange universe through the eyes of a student guide to Blackwell Academy and Arcadia Bay. It features notes, sketches and photographs from various characters of the first game. = Potential television series = In July 2016, Legendary Digital Studios and Square Enix announced that they would be adapting Life Is Strange as a digital series. At the time of the announcement, they were meeting with potential writers for the series adaptation, which would be set in Arcadia Bay. In 2017, dj2 Entertainment had sold the rights to the series to the streaming service Hulu. As of 2020, no further details have been announced.  Reception  Reception to the franchise has been generally positive. Life Is Strange received generally favourable reviews, with a Metacritic score of 85/100 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Some criticised issues with the games's lip-syncing and use of outdated slang, but most lauded the character development and time travel component. Eurogamer called it \\"one of the best interactive story games of this generation\\" and Hardcore Gamer said it was the sleeper hit of 2015. Life Is Strange received over 75 Game of the Year awards and listings. Life Is Strange: Before the Storm was met with generally favourable reviews, according to Metacritic. Critics praised the characters, themes, and story, but criticised plotholes, the main relationship, and the impact of players' decisions near the end of the game. Life Is Strange 2 was met with generally favourable reviews, according to Metacritic. The Verge said that the game \\"wades into more political, timely topics\\", with the first episode set in October 2016, right before the 2016 United States presidential election. In their verdict, IGN also opined about the underlying political atmosphere of the game, describing it as a \\"bigger, more complex story than told by its predecessor, charting a cross-country road trip across Donald Trump‚Äôs America\\", going on to say that \\"though its social criticisms feel broad and rather clumsy, its core story of brotherhood and fraternity between two believable characters is enormously touching\\".

Biography  Born April 17, 1885 in Chart√®ves in the department of Aisne, she is the third daughter of Auguste Juillard and Victorine Marchand. She married Charles Drouet on January 15, 1906, in B√©theny where she lived and ran a grocery store called ‚ÄúLe Pot-au-rouge‚Äù on Henri-Gand street. In 1914, Marie Drouet's husband was at the front in Verdun. Despite her family charge of four children, she saves many wounded lying on the battlefields around Reims. She died on November 19, 1963, in B√©theny, where she continued her job as a grocer.Bernard Cornuaille, Femmes d'Exception en Champagne, Marie Drouet, Le Papillon Rouge Editeur, 2016 pp. 181‚Äì189 = WWI civil heroine = Throughout the conflict, avoiding French and German encampments, she transported the wounded from the battlefield to the hospital using her plow and donkey. It also informed the French artillerymen on German positions by means of slips of paper displayed at her windows. Suspected by the French secret service of working for the enemy, the order accompanying the captain who came to arrest her at her home exonerates her. He recognized the person who picked up the wounded, the incident was closed and Marie cleared. It was during this period that she gave birth to her fifth child. = Legacy = Marie received a medal from the city of Reims shortly after the Armistice, after which she fell into anonymity until her death in 1963. The month following her burial, an article in the newspaper ' recounted her exploits. In 2014, still in the same newspaper, a second article was devoted to her on the occasion of the hundred years of the First World War. In April 2018, Val-de-Vesle dedicated a street to her. In September 2018, on the occasion of Heritage Days, the Association of Friends of Old B√©theny, organized an exhibition dedicated to her at the B√©theny museum to commemorate her rescue of many wounded. In 2018, during the commemorations of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, a tribute was paid to her in front of the monument to the dead of B√©theny.

This helps health professionals ascertain how bad the epidemic is and where it is worst. The accuracy of national statistics on the number of cases and deaths from the outbreak depend on knowing how many people are being tested every day, and how the available tests are being allocated.  Timeline  CDPHE, and San Miguel County personnel assist at a drive-up testing center in Telluride, Colorado. May 14: COVID-19 test conducted in Salt Lake City, Utah April 5: Testing team in Charleston, West Virginia responds to a confirmed case in a nursing home. = January 2020 = While the WHO opted to use an approach developed by Germany to test for SARS-CoV-2, the United States developed its own testing approach. The German testing method was made public on January 13, and the American testing method was made public on January 28. The WHO did not offer any test kits to the U.S. because the U.S. normally had the supplies to produce their own tests. The United States had a slow start in widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing. From the start of the outbreak until early March 2020, the CDC gave restrictive guidelines on who should be eligible for COVID-19 testing. The initial criteria were (a) people who had recently traveled to certain countries, or (b) people with respiratory illness serious enough to require hospitalization, or (c) people who have been in contact with a person confirmed to have coronavirus. = February 2020 = In February, the U.S. CDC produced 160,000 SARS-CoV-2 tests, but soon it was discovered that many were defective and gave inaccurate readings. On February 19, the first U.S. patient with COVID-19 of unknown origin (a possible indication of community transmission) was hospitalized. The patient's test was delayed for four days because he had not qualified for a test under the initial federal testing criteria. By February 27, fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the U.S. Although academic laboratories and hospitals had developed their own tests, they were not allowed to use them until February 29, when the FDA issued approvals for them and private companies. From February 25, a group of researchers from the Seattle Flu Study defied federal and state officials to conduct their own tests, using samples already collected from flu study subjects who had not given permission for SARS-CoV-2 testing. They quickly found a teenager infected with SARS-CoV-2 of unknown origin, newly indicating that an outbreak had already been occurring in Washington for the past six weeks. State regulators stopped these researchers' testing on March 2, although the testing later resumed through the creation of the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network. = March 2020 = On March5, the CDC relaxed the criteria to allow doctors discretion to decide who would be eligible for tests. Also on March 5, Vice President Mike Pence, the leader of the coronavirus response team, acknowledged that \\"we don't have enough tests\\" to meet the predicted future demand; this announcement came only three days after FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn committed to producing nearly a million tests by that week. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Representative Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts both noted that as of March8 their states had not yet received the new test kits. By March 11, the U.S had tested fewer than 10,000 people. Doctor Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged on March 12 it was \\"a failing\\" of the U.S. system that the demand for SARS-CoV-2 tests was not being met; Fauci later clarified that he believed the private sector should have been brought in sooner to address the shortfall. By mid-March, the U.S. had tested 125 people per million of their population, which was lower than several other countries. The first COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and South Korea were identified at around the same time. Critics say the U.S. government has botched the approval and distribution of test kits, losing crucial time during the early weeks of the outbreak, with the result that the true number of cases in the United States was impossible to estimate with any reasonable accuracy. By March 12, all fifty states were able to perform tests, with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or local commercial lab. This was followed by the government announcing a series of measures intended to speed up testing. These measures included the appointment of Admiral Brett Giroir of the U.S. Public Health Service to oversee testing, funding for two companies developing rapid tests, and a hotline to help labs find needed supplies. The FDA also gave emergency authorization for New York to obtain an automated coronavirus testing machine. In a March 13 press conference, the Trump administration announced a campaign to conduct tests in retail store parking lots across the country, but this was not widely implemented. On March 13, drive-through testing in the U.S. began in New Rochelle, Westchester County, as New Rochelle was the U.S. town with the most diagnosed cases at that time. By March 22, drive-through testing had started in more than thirty states, although the Associated Press reported that \\"the system has been marked by inconsistencies, delays, and shortages,\\" leading to many people waiting hours or days even though they showed symptoms and were recommended by a doctor to get a test. A lack of supplies had already forced the closure of drive-through testing in seven states. By March 30, more than a million people had been tested, but not all the people showing symptoms were being tested. = April 2020 = During the weeks of April6 and 13, the U.S. conducted about 150,000 tests per day, while experts recommended at least 500,000 per day prior to ending social distancing, with some recommending several times that level. Building up both testing and surveillance capacity are important to re-opening the economy; the purpose of social distancing is to buy time for such capacity-building. On April 6, Federal health inspectors released a report stating that hospitals were experiencing shortages of test supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results. The New York Times reported on April 26 that the U.S. still had yet to reach an adequate level of testing capacity needed to monitor and contain outbreaks. The capacity has been hampered by shortages of reagents, shortages of test kits components like nasal swabs, shortages of protective gear for health workers, limited laboratory workers and equipment, and the federal government's limited interventions to solve shortages, instead of leaving the issue to the free market, causing states and hospitals to compete with each other for supplies. = May to July 2020 = By early May, the U.S. was testing around 240,000 to 260,000 people per day, but this was still an inadequate level to contain the outbreak. By June 24, thirteen of the forty-one federally funded community- based testing sites originally established in March were set to lose federal funding. They will remain under state and local control. Trump administration testing czar Admiral Giroir described the original community-based testing program as \\"antiquated\\". By June 26, 2020, Dr. Fauci said the administration was considering pooled testing as a way to speed up testing. = August 2020 to present = By August, the overall ratio of positive to total tests was close to seven percent‚Äîwell above the five percent the WHO considers to be the threshold for containment. Trump has offered conflicting opinions about testing. In June 2020 Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing‚Äî\\"If we didn't do testing, we would have no cases\\"‚Äîand he told a June rally that he had ordered a slowdown in testing. The White House said he had been joking; he himself said \\"I don't kid\\" before later claiming he had said it sarcastically. Dr. Fauci clarified that the administration was ramping up testing, not slowing it down. In July he continued to suggest that \\"if we did half the testing we would have half the cases\\" and that a large number of reported cases was \\"fodder for the fake news.\\" He has also said that he was \\"okay\\" with testing even though it \\"makes us look bad.\\" As of mid-August, according to Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. has been doing the most per-capita testing of any country, although Our World in Data shows other countries having higher rates‚ÄîNew Zealand, Israel, and the UK are examples. The U.S. test positivity rate was still beyond the WHO's recommended threshold for controlling the outbreak. The New York Times reported that the Department of Health and Human Services and the administration wrote guidance released in August that was never subject to CDC scientific review, and thus took over the CDC imprimatur. Subtle but obvious errors were not CDC material such as \\"testing for Covid-19\\" (rather than for the virus that causes that illness). In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for who should be tested, saying that people who have been exposed to the virus but are not showing symptoms \\"do not necessarily need a test\\". The previous recommendation had been that people exposed to the virus should be \\"quickly identified and tested\\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus. Experts expressed concern about the change, pointing out that about half of all community spread of the virus comes from people who are asymptomatic. It was later reported that the change had been due to pressure from high up in the Trump administration‚Äî\\"from the top down\\".  Types of testing  Tests are generally divided into two types. Viral testing can identify if a person is currently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Antibody testing can identify if a person has previously been exposed to the virus. As of August 2020, the FDA had granted Emergency Use Authorizations to over 200 tests for detecting current or past infection. The majority of COVID-19 tests in the United States use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viral genetic material, or RNA. In contrast to PCR tests, which detect viral genetic material, antigen testing can detect proteins on the surface of the virus. Antigen tests are generally less invasive but less accurate than PCR tests. Antibody testing can reveal if a patient has had previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. After exposure to an infection, the human body may develop antibodies. These antibodies may help provide immunity against that particular infection in the future. Testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is not meant to discover current infection. Antibody testing has a higher rate of testing error than viral testing.

The team is primarily known for humorous comedy. It is associated with Doordarshan since 1988 and has appeared in eight hundred uncertain double act shows, including in Bangkok, Singapore and Toronto. In 2015, the two changed their original stage name following the indecent Santa Banta-related social media contents posted by the Internet users that allegedly targeted specific minority community such as Sikhs.  Background  Santa (now Shugli) was born as Gurpreet Singh and Banta (now Jugli) was born as Prabhpreet Singh in Punjab, India. Santa Banta is a character originally created by Khushwant Singh, an India author. The duo became known as Santa Banta in 1997 or earlier when a producer asked the team to choose it as stage name.  Career  The two started professional career in 1988 with Doordarshan's comedy programme titled Sandali, and later in 1955, duo appeared in Raunak Mela, Lara Lappa and Bach Ke Mod To TV programmes. The two later created 104 short episodes in 2000 after a production company was formed by Banta, the younger brother. It was also assigned by the government to perform in TV shows during the 1984 anti- Sikh riots under the government security. (in Hindi)  Controversies  The duo changed its stage name after the two were criticised for being responsible for practicing sardarji joke during stand-up shows, leading the Internet users post offensive contents across the social media platforms. In 2016, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee filed a petition to the Supreme Court of India to prohibit people, explicitly the Internet users from posting Santa Banta-related contents online. Later in 2017, the Supreme Court delivered its verdic and declined to formulate constitutional guidelines against the petition, citing \\"the courts cannot lay down moral guidelines for citizens\\".

It is a double-ended rowboat usually made of wood. Today they are mainly used as pleasure boats.  Origin, history, and use  Peapods were developed in Maine for lobstering. U.S. government reports from the 19th century record that the peapod was developed on the island of North Haven about 1870. However, Eric Dow, a Maine boat builder, disputed that the peapod's origin could be traced to any particular place in Maine. They were originally known as \\"double-enders.\\" The peapod's shallow draft enabled navigation of rocky Maine waters where larger boats could not go. Peapods were commonly rowed from a forward-facing standing position. The peapod's easy maneuverability also made it a favorite among lighthouse keepers. James \\"Jimmy\\" Steele was a well-known builder of peapods. Many of his tools and molds are in the Penobscot Marine Museum collection. Elisabeth Ogilvie's novels about traditional lobstering communities in Maine make frequent reference to peapods.

History  Alpha Iota was founded on October 21, 1925 by Elsie M. Fenton at the American Institute of Business in Des Moines, Iowa for the purpose of promoting friendship among the students of that school. Membership requirements are: Every girl must be a high school graduate or have had an equivalent education before entering this school, must be doing superior work as a student, and must be of good character and personality.Early history according to the Alpha Iota national website, and its newsletters, accessed 12 Sept 2020. An review of the schools that hosted chapters shows that the initial focus of the sorority was to serve what today would be called secretarial or stenography schools, but was expanded during the Great Depression and WWII era to chapters at teachers colleges and full universities. The sorority's focus therefore shifted with the expansion of opportunities for women in business. Alpha Iota was incorporated in early 1930, then opened 28 chapters that same year.As noted in Vol 21, Issue 3, of The Journal of Business Education, March 1945, accessed 13 Sept 2020. A 1932 Journal of Business Education notes that the organization already had over 60 chapters at publication. (Journal, v.8, Issue 2, 1932) After a period of quick growth, membership dwindled in the postwar period. A significant driver of this trend was the closure of many early business schools as they were displaced by junior, technical, and four-year colleges. Today the fraternity is divided into five districts, mostly of alumnae chapters, with groups throughout the US and Canada. Creed and Five Objects The Creed of Alpha Iota is: > The purpose of Alpha Iota is to make each member a better business woman > through development of self-confidence, leadership, and awareness of > responsibility to herself and her community. A spirit of loyalty, > friendship, participation and education, is fostered among all members. Alpha Iota has set Five Objects as goals for its members: :1. To create and perpetuate a friendly spirit among students of our school. :2. To extend friendly courtesies to new students. :3. To build up a continued loyalty to our Alma Mater. :4. To create and perpetuate a friendly spirit among the members of the various chapters of Alpha Iota. :5. To help each other when possible in the securing of positions and promotions.  Milestones  On April 11, 1930, Alpha Iota was incorporated under the laws of the State of Iowa as a non-profit organization with the right to grant charters and establish chapters throughout the United States and Canada. The first Alumnae Chapter of Alpha Iota was organized May 28, 1930. By the end of 1930, twenty- one charters had been granted. Growth proceeded swiftly, with an emphasis on business schools. By 1932 it had over 4,000 members, growing to 8,000 by 1936. The society reached 10,000 members on June 19, 1937.As noted in Vol 13, Issue 2, of The Journal of Business Education, March 1937, accessed 13 Sept 2020. During WWII the sorority set a goal of raising $1M in war bonds for the purchase of a B-29 Super Fortress bomber.

There were 128 women competing in Oldehove, Leeuwarden and the competition was won by Trijntje Pieters Westra. Four years later, on 20 January 1809, she competed again in the women's race in Oldehove on the stadsgracht. At this competition, 64 unmarried women participated. She made it to the final where she beat Maike Meyers from Heeg and won a golden . Along the ice there were huge crowds watching the races.

It is a concept album that continues the story introduced in their previous studio effort, Apex. It is their first album released after the departure of bassist Nikko Whitworth and, since he's yet to be officially replaced, it also marks their first album recorded as a quartet.  Background, production and writing  The band originally planned to release Apex and Abyss as a double album, but they were running out of time and decided to release Apex alone in 2017. During the first half of 2019, they disconnected from everything related to Apex and searched for new influences. By the other half, they wrote the rest of the songs, which would eventually form Abyss, and the album was recorded in January 2020 in Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark. In an interview, vocalist Brittney Slayes expressed relief that they were able to do the recordings before the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The album title, cover and track-list were announced on 18 June 2020, together with the first single \\"Abyss\\".  Plot  The album continues the story started on Apex; vocalist Brittney Slayes described the plot as follows: In the end, the characters decide to use anger to raise their soul instead of spreading mayhem. According to Slayes, Abyss deals with topics such as good versus evil and light versus dark, while showcasing the conflict between the protagonist's good and bad sides and his will to define if he's just a tool or a free being.  Composition and song information  For the first time, the band recorded an album using only seven-string guitars, and Abyss also sees them exploring more of the synthesizer. According to Slayes, this was done in order to \\"give a different quality than Apex. We wanted it to be a more ethereal sounding record.\\" \\"Through Stars\\" was composed as a synthwave song \\"hidden behind metal\\" and \\"Carry the Flame\\" was described by Slayes as \\"a weird spin on a power ballad\\"; both songs are influenced by the 1980s music. \\"Legacy\\" has no chorus and \\"Faster Than Light\\" is played in a faster, Stratovarius-like pace and describes the moment in which the Immortal decides to stop running from his past mistakes and face what he's done. The ending track \\"Afterlife\\" features orchestrations by Francesco Paoli (Fleshgod Apocalypse). Guitarist Andrew Kingsley had originally written these parts, but the band felt they sounded like a computer and producer Jacob Hansen, who had mixed and mastered Fleshgod Apocalypse's 2019 album Veleno, contacted Ferrini, who worked on Kingsley's material.  Release and promotion  The album has been released in digital and physical formats, including a double disc gatefold in different colors. There's also a limited edition in \\"deluxe earbook\\" format containing two bonus tracks (a synthwave version of \\"Abyss\\" and a folk pop version of \\"Soulbound\\") and a bonus disc with instrumental versions of the regular songs. On the day after the album's release, the band performed live at The Rickshaw Theatre in Vancouver and streamed the show. The band plans to release a two-book graphic novel about the story of Apex and Abyss.

Located in Grant Park, the monument was dedicated in 1948 to Talbot, who had founded what is now the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in the city in 1888.  History  On May 5, 1888, railroad machinist Thomas W. Talbot, along with 18 other machinists, organized a labor union that would later become known as the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) in Atlanta, Georgia. Talbot would die several years later in 1892. In May 1948, on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the union, the union dedicated this monument to their founder. The statue was dedicated on May 5 of that year, in a dedication ceremony attended by a grandson and great grandson of Talbot's, with then-IAM president Harvey W. Brown giving a dedication speech. Over 1,500 IAM members attended the anniversary celebrations in Atlanta. The location for the monument, Grant Park, was chosen due to its prominence in the city, and today the area is a plaza near an entrance for Zoo Atlanta. In 2013, to celebrate the union's 125th anniversary, a new plaque was dedicated for the statue. The IAM local from Marietta, Georgia hosted the event.

The organization provided safe, free, confidential, and non-judgmental rides home to university students and their guests during nights of operation. Drive Safe Kalamazoo ceased operations at the end of the Spring 2018 semester after providing over 98,000 rides.  History  Drive Safe Kalamazoo's original logo The idea of a safe-ride service at Western Michigan University came from a class in the early 2000s, in which the students were tasked with finding a way to combat drunk driving. Largely borrowing ideas from the established CARPOOL safe-ride service at Texas A&M; University, Drive Safe Kalamazoo began operations on Thursday, September 18, 2003, on which a total of 53 rides were provided.  Operations  A DSK car sign during operations Drive Safe Kalamazoo normally operated on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. Requests for rides were accepted between 11:00pm and 3:00am at the organization's hotline, 345-0DSK. Only WMU students were able to request rides, though students were permitted to bring up to two non-student guests in the ride with them. Furthermore, students were only able to utilize DSK for rides to their home or residence; requests for rides to bars, parties, and restaurants were denied. Rides were only provided within the Kalamazoo city limits. The organization's staffing consisted entirely of WMU student volunteers, including the Executive Board. Volunteers were required to complete a one-day training class before being allowed to work on nights of operation. Each car contained two volunteers: one driver and one navigator. While both volunteers were originally required to be different genders, this policy was abolished in 2013. Occasionally, DSK partnered with another organization or fraternity, who would fill all volunteer slots for a night. Other volunteer positions during nights of operation included two Dispatchers, who communicated with the navigators and relayed ride information, two Operators, who answered calls to the hotline and recorded rider information, and one Executive Board member serving as the Director in Charge (DIC), overseeing the night's operation. These volunteers worked out of DSK's operations center, which relocated from a donated apartment at Westchester Woods Apartments to the Student Organization Center (SOC) in the Bernhard Center on the WMU campus in 2015. Five cars were used for operations on Thursday nights, and seven cars were used for operations on Friday and Saturday nights. Additional cars were added for special events and holiday weekends. Cars were sourced fully-insured from Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Funding for DSK was obtained from the Western Student Association's Allocations Committee, which granted funds from the Student Assessment Fee account. In 2018, this amount was stated to be approximately $13,000 per semester. Further donations were obtained through fundraising efforts and events at places including Cedar Point, Detroit Electronic Music Festival, and Kalamazoo Wings. Additionally, riders were solicited for an optional cash donation to the organization near the end of each ride.  Decline and shutdown  In 2015, the app-based ride service Uber launched in Kalamazoo. Drive Safe Kalamazoo struggled to compete with Uber's mobile platform, greater availability, and shorter wait times, resulting in the erosion of its ridership. Drive Safe Kalamazoo's volunteer base was similarly decimated, with volunteer drivers flocking to Uber seeking to earn income for the same job. Occasionally, DSK's weekly volunteer sign-up emails were opened by only 3% of subscribers. In the Fall semester of 2015, DSK reduced its operational capacity from seven cars to six cars on Friday and Saturday nights due to the reduced demand. In 2017, operations were canceled on more than 5 nights due to volunteers failing to appear for shifts they had signed up for. In early 2018, Drive Safe Kalamazoo provided an average of 80 rides per weekend, significantly lower than its average of 300 rides per weekend in Spring 2015. On April 30, 2018, Drive Safe Kalamazoo announced the cessation of operations and dissolution of the organization. The stated reasons for the shutdown were a lack of volunteer support, insufficient amount of rides, needed technological updates, and an absence of members left to assist in the growth of DSK's future. At the time of its closure, DSK had provided over 98,000 rides home over its 14-year existence.

Life  Ute Marianne Elisabeth Halle was born in Bremerhaven, Germany, on November 9, 1928. Her parents, Maxwell Halle and Margarethe Kohlhepp, were both doctors. As the Nazis assumed power, Halley‚Äôs father ‚Äì who was Jewish and thus forbidden to practice medicine ‚Äì immigrated to the U.S. with her older brother, in 1936. They would be joined by Halley‚Äôs mother a year later, which left Anne and her twin sister, Renate, under the protection of their aunt, who enrolled the twins in the school where she taught. Finally, in 1938, Anne and Renate were able to move to the U.S., and the family settled in Orlean, New York. Halley attended Wellesley College, graduating in 1949 with a bachelor of arts degree. She earned a master's degree in English from the University of Minnesota in 1951. In 1953, Halley married Jules Chametzky. In 1958, they moved to Amherst, Massachusetts, after Chametzky was offered a faculty position at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. They had three sons. In 2004, at the age of 75, Anne Halley died from complications of multiple myeloma.  Career  Halley first taught as a teaching assistant at the University of Minnesota before going on to teach at both UMass Amherst and Smith College as a part-time instructor and visiting lecturer; she was also an Assistant Professor at Holyoke Community College where she was active in the anti-war in Vietnam protests. In addition, she taught intermittently in Germany at Frankfurt University and the Free University of Berlin.

Adaptive design typically involves advanced statistics to interpret a clinical trial endpoint. Schematic block diagram of an adaptive design for a clinical trial Characteristics Traditionally, clinical trials are conducted in three steps: #The trial is designed. #The trial is conducted as prescribed by the design. #Once the data are ready, they are analysed according to a pre-specified analysis plan. Modifications using an adaptive design may include: *refining the sample size *abandoning treatments or doses *changing the allocation ratio of patients to trial arms *identifying trial participants most likely to benefit and focusing recruitment efforts on them *stopping the whole trial at an early stage for success or lack of efficacy. Usage The adaptive design method developed mainly in the early 21st century. In November 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration provided guidelines for using adaptive designs in clinical trials. = in 2020 COVID-19 related trials= In April 2020, the World Health Organization published an \\"R&D; Blueprint (for the) novel Coronavirus\\" (Blueprint). The Blueprint documented a \\"large, international, multi-site, individually randomized controlled clinical trial\\" to allow \\"the concurrent evaluation of the benefits and risks of each promising candidate vaccine within 3-6 months of it being made available for the trial.\\" The Blueprint listed a Global Target Product Profile (TPP) for COVID‚Äë19, identifying favorable attributes of safe and effective vaccines under two broad categories: \\"vaccines for the long-term protection of people at higher risk of COVID‚Äë19, such as healthcare workers\\", and other vaccines to provide rapid-response immunity for new outbreaks. The international TPP team was formed to 1) assess the development of the most promising candidate vaccines; 2) map candidate vaccines and their clinical trial worldwide, publishing a frequently-updated \\"landscape\\" of vaccines in development; 3) rapidly evaluate and screen for the most promising candidate vaccines simultaneously before they are tested in humans; and 4) design and coordinate a multiple-site, international randomized controlled trialthe \\"Solidarity trial\\" for vaccinesto enable simultaneous evaluation of the benefits and risks of different vaccine candidates under clinical trials in countries where there are high rates of COVID‚Äë19 disease, ensuring fast interpretation and sharing of results around the world. The WHO vaccine coalition will prioritize which vaccines should go into PhaseII and III clinical trials, and determine harmonized PhaseIII protocols for all vaccines achieving the pivotal trial stage. The global \\"Solidarity\\" and European \\"Discovery\\" trials of hospitalized people with severe COVID‚Äë19 infection apply adaptive design to rapidly alter trial parameters as results from the four experimental therapeutic strategies emerge.

The song was written by Aimee Mann, Michael Hausman, Robert Holmes and Joey Pesce, and produced by Mike Thorne. \\"Love in a Vacuum\\" peaked at No. 88 on the US Cash Box Top 100 Pop Singles chart. Background 'Til Tuesday first recorded \\"Love in a Vacuum\\" in 1983, before they had signed a record deal and shortly after winning the WBCN Rock 'n' Roll Rumble in Boston. The band sent producer and engineer Ian Taylor a demo tape in the hope he would be interested in recording a demo with the band and generate awareness of them through his connections in the music industry. Taylor produced the \\"Love in a Vacuum\\" demo which was independently released in 1983 and gained heavy rotation on Boston's WBCN-FM. The band's victory in the Rock and Roll Rumble, along with the subsequent publicity and local airplay of \\"Love in a Vacuum\\", helped gain the attention of Epic Records, who signed the band in 1984. The band's debut album, Voices Carry, was recorded with producer Mike Thorne and included a new recording of \\"Love in a Vacuum\\". As the album's third and final single, \\"Love in a Vacuum\\" failed to enter the US Billboard Hot 100, but did reach No. 88 on the Cash Box Top 100 Pop Singles chart. Guitarist Robert Holmes told Rolling Stone in 1986, \\"'Voices Carry' didn't sound like an obvious hit to me. If anything, I thought 'Love in a Vacuum' sounded like a big hit. And that totally died.\\" Music video The song's music video was directed and produced by Ken Ross and Richard Levine. It received medium rotation on MTV. The video was influenced by Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 French crime-drama film Breathless. Although Ross and Levine wanted to copy certain scenes and use quotes from the film, Mann insisted the video take a \\"more improvised\\" approach. Critical reception On its release as a single, Cash Box noted the song's \\"mysterious Fairlight synthesizer sound\\" and added that a \\"fuller production is in evidence on this cut than on the others [from Voices Carry], with a heartier chorus\\". In a review of Voices Carry, Cheryl Wenner of The Morning Call considered the song \\"especially worth a listen\\" and described it as \\"explosive\\" and \\"funky\\" with its \\"simple guitar-keyboards interplay\\". Eleni P. Austin of The Desert Sun wrote, \\"Insistent bass lines and hushed harmonies of 'Love in a Vacuum' get the LP off to a good start. Holmes' spacy guitar riffs puncture Mann's dainty vocals as she tells her boyfriend that his technique is wearing thin.\\" Alexandra K. Mann of The Daily Tar Heel noted the band's \\"beautiful harmonies\\" which she felt were \\"especially evident\\" on \\"Love in a Vacuum\\", a song she described as \\"one of the best on the album\\". In a retrospective review of the song, Liana Jonas of AllMusic felt the song was characterized by the \\"syncopated guitar lines\\", \\"driving slap bass\\" and \\"undeniably '80s-style synth pop\\". She added, \\"Mann emotionally and strongly sings of being stifled in an unhealthy relationship.\\" Joe Viglione, in an AllMusic review of Voices Carry, was critical of Thorne's production on the song in comparison to the \\"inspired and innovative\\" 1983 demo. Viglione noted, \\"The original was perfect, [but] the Thorne version is over-produced, creating a good album track when the true follow-up hit was actually in hand.\\" Track listing ;7\\" single #\\"Love in a Vacuum\\" ‚Äì 3:20 #\\"No More Crying\\" ‚Äì 4:18 ;7\\" single (US promo) #\\"Love in a Vacuum\\" (Single Remix) ‚Äì 3:20 #\\"Love in a Vacuum\\" (Long Version) ‚Äì 3:35 ;12\\" (US promo) #\\"Love in a Vacuum\\" (Single Remix) ‚Äì 3:20 #\\"Love in a Vacuum\\" (Long Version) ‚Äì 3:35 Personnel 'Til Tuesday * Aimee Mann ‚Äì vocals, bass * Robert Holmes ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals * Joey Pesce ‚Äì synthesizer, backing vocals * Michael Hausman ‚Äì drums, percussion Production * Mike Thorne ‚Äì producer * William Wittman ‚Äì single remix of \\"Love in a Vacuum\\" * Domenic Maita ‚Äì engineer * Mike Krowiak, Jeff Lippay ‚Äì studio assistants * Harvey Goldberg ‚Äì mixing engineer * Moira Marquis ‚Äì mixing assistant * Jack Skinner ‚Äì mastering Other * Deborah Feingold ‚Äì photography Charts {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" - !Chart (1985) !Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"US Cash Box Top 100 Pop Singles  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"88 } References Category:1983 songs Category:1985 singles Category:'Til Tuesday songs Category:Epic Records singles Category:Songs written by Aimee Mann Category:Song recordings produced by Mike Thorne ","title":"Love in a Vacuum"},{"id":"65297126","text":"Pablo Mart√≠n may refer to: *Pablo Mart√≠n Arteaga (born 1965), Spanish wheelchair basketball player *Pablo Mart√≠n Asuero (born 1967), Spanish orientalist *Pablo P√©rez √Ålvarez (born Pablo Mart√≠n P√©rez √Ålvarez; born 1969), Venezuelan politician *Pablo Mart√≠n Abal (born 1977), retired Argentine swimmer *Pablo Lima (Pablo Mart√≠n Lima Olid; born 1981), Uruguayan footballer *Pablo Batalla (Pablo Mart√≠n Batalla; born 1984), Argentine footballer *Pablo Mart√≠n Ledesma (born 1984), Argentine footballer *Pablo Miranda (Pablo Mart√≠n Miranda (born 1984), Argentine footballer *Pablo Bangardino (Pablo Mart√≠n Bangardino; born 1985), Argentine footballer *Pablo Mart√≠n (golfer) (born 1986), Spanish golfer *Mart√≠n Peraf√°n (Pablo Mart√≠n Peraf√°n; born 1987), Argentine footballer *Pablo Mart√≠n Ruiz (born 1987), Argentine footballer *Pablo Lacoste (Pablo Mart√≠n Lacoste Icardi; born 1988), Uruguayan footballer ","title":"Pablo Mart√≠n"},{"id":"65297129","text":"Immuni is an open-source COVID-19 contact tracing app used for digital contact tracing in Italy.

The CED successfully passed rent control laws in 1979 in Santa Monica, and they backed the 1986 California Proposition 65 to reduce toxins discharged into public water sources. Tom Hayden in 2007 Another goal of the CED was to support Hayden's hard-fought 1982 bid for a seat on the California State Assembly, in which he was victorious. That same year, the CED helped to elect 60 California state politicians. The CED was funded at first by money from Fonda's film career, then increasingly by the growing Jane Fonda's Workout media franchise, including three exercise studios in 1979‚Äì80, the best-selling Jane Fonda's Workout Book in 1981, and in 1982 a Platinum-certified exercise record and the hugely popular home video, which developed into a series. In early 1982 before the LP and video were released, Hayden said the PAC was receiving $30,000 each month from Fonda's workout studios and book. In 1984, Fonda reduced her contributions to the CED in order to fund her own political interests, such as abortion rights and ending apartheid in South Africa. Even so, the CED reported that Fonda's Workout franchise had donated about $800,000 in 1986 ‚Äì half of their annual budget. Fonda gradually pulled back from the CED, reducing her visibility due to the persistent political backlash against her 1972 visit to Hanoi, Vietnam, when she rashly posed for photos on an enemy anti-aircraft artillery unit. Hayden saw poll results showing that negative feelings for Fonda among voters were probably holding back his political rise. The CED disbanded in July 1986 to be replaced by Hayden's Campaign California using the same headquarters and staff, but widening to state and national aspirations.

It enables patients to self-analyze their medical condition and mitigate their suffering.The need for self- management can be extrapolated from the fact that 50% of world's population lacks access to quality healthcare. The role that self-care can play in treating chronic illnesses is of vital significance. Self-management instructions teaches the essential administrative skills necessary for proper at-home management to those without any formal healthcare training.  Self- management  Self-management is defined as the systematic provision of education and supportive interventions by healthcare staff to increase patient's skills and confidence in managing their health problems. The concept of self-management has now been firmly established in the Western healthcare policy and practice. However, there is still some sort of ambiguity associated with this term. Patients are inexperienced when it comes to self-managing themselves.The patients ought to be taught with an earnest dedication to self- care. There is, however, a significant amount of research articles and literature available on self-management for those who want to learn the science of self-management. = Education Programs = The educational programs on self-management in patients are mighty effective and are promised to produce results. The educational programs are the primary aid for the patient's education and the physician's advocate to verify the patient's at- home compliance.The educational programs rendered successful can act as a tool that instructs patients and caregivers on how to systematically log daily medical conclusions, collaborate, and organize care from outside care resources and deliver the entire integration of medical care records back to the primary provider. The training, however needs to begin at the grassroots of the healthcare industry and focus on developing the administration skills required for everyday people to learn how to properly self-manage care. A better vision of care could be achieved only if the educational programs extend beyond the patient-provider conversation within the treatment room and are brought exclusively into their private homes and implemented aptly. = Effective Communication = The use of effective communication among patients and healthcare professionals is critical for achieving the art of self- management in patients. Effective communication can aid in the prevention of adverse events whereas ineffective communication can do the opposite. Enhanced communication with clinicians can help health consumers to create an at-home care team and organize an individualized health story in which providers can easily and quickly obtain the relevant information in question.  Telemedicine  Telemedicine is the practice of medicine using technology to deliver care at a distance. It allows patients and healthcare providers to communicate via video, phone or email for diagnosis, treatment and, general care. In the wake of covid-19 scourge, telemedicine played a vital role in treating patients while maintaining a safe distance. = Telemedicine and its challenges = A recent survey conducted in the USA suggests that 84% patients prefer a provider that offers telemedicine over one that doesn't. Despite its huge demand, telemedicine faces several challenges. Here are a few of them: * Patient's lack of technical skills * Expensive Technology * Privacy Concerns * Interoperability * Malpractice * Reimbursement * Lack of integration * Service awareness * Lack of legislation governing telehealth programs = Advocacy in Telemedicine through self-management = Over the last decade, telemedicine has moved at a snail's pace to create a working strategy that could successfully fulfill the remote healthcare needs of America's most underserved patients. Because of its slow application and lack of availability, consumers continue to be interested but remain skeptical. For providers, this is a significant barrier that must be addressed. Consumers are unsure if telemedicine services are covered by insurance. As a result, it is critical for providers to help their patients before they are in a moment where they need care. To increase adoption, a platform that is patient-centric is also key. Organizations can provide guidance on making telemedicine more mainstream, but at the end of the day, telemedicine must focus on the participants in virtual care. Until the recent lift of parity laws, telemedicine has been fighting an uphill battle since its conception.At the core of telemedicine challenges and what people do not realize, is that the hindrance of telemedicine's implementation lies in the patient's ability(or inability) to self-manage care.

M. Weston is a scholar of medieval literature and Old English language. She teaches at Fresno State Department of English, and served as interim Chair of the department in 2019.  Early life and education  Weston was born in England, and moved to Canada before settling in the United States. She studied at University of California, Los Angeles for her PhD. which was awarded in 1982.  Research  Weston's research interests include Old English wisdom poetry; texts related to magic or ritual; and representations of sex and gender in ecclesiastical writings, liturgy, and hagiography. She has written on women writers of the Middle Ages including Baudonivia of Poitiers and Hrotsvit of Gandersheim. Her work brings feminist and queer theory into medieval studies to explore sex, gender, and literacy in early medieval English poetry and prose, and she is a specialist in literary representations of pre-modern lesbian and same-sex love and desire. = Friendship in medieval liteature and letters = Two articles by Weston have particularly examined the role of letter writing in ecclesiastical friendships. Kathryn Maude notes that Weston argues how although medieval letters may be read as an attempt to \\"enable emotional and intellectual presence despite physical absense\\", letters by the late-eighth century nun Berhtgyth (a member of the Anglo-Saxon mission to Germany, whose lettesrs are preserved in a mid-ninth century manuscript known as the \\"Boniface correspondence\\") express a dissatisfaction, and that letter-writing only increased desire for physical contact. = Premodern lesbian studies = Her chapter \\"Virgin Desires: Reading a Homoerotics of Female Monastic Community\\" features in The Lesbian Premodern, edited by Noreen Giffney, Michelle M. Sauer, and Diane Watt, published in 2011 with Palgrave Macmillan. Reviewing The Lesbian Premodern, Jessica A. Boon notes that Weston's contribution to the volume \\"examines a letter written by one early medieval nun to another that has been preserved in a compilation with Jerome‚Äôs letter to Marcella and a vita of Radegund. Reading all three texts in conjunction, she tracks the intricacies of ‚Äúbecoming a virgin in community‚Äù (95) in order to determine how gender and sexuality are both reoriented in the process of becoming a nun\\". Weston is an active member of the Society for the Study of Homosexuality in the Middle Ages, and has spoken on \\"queer pedagogy\\" and \\"post-queer\\" scholarship at society events. At a SSHMA round table event in 2013, in answer to the question \\"Are we post Queer?\\", Weston replied that ‚ÄúAs long as there are categories ‚Äì one can fuck with them. Queer Theory is an academic trickster and tricksters are never out of style‚Äù. = Contributions to academic organisations = Weston previously served on the Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship Advisory Board, having joined the Society when it was the Medieval Femininst Newsletter in 1993. In 2004, Weston organised the Old English Division of the Modern Language Association. Weston's research is further concerned with the making of and future of the discipline of medieval studies. In her 2010 article \\"What would Byrhtwold do?\\" for the journal postmedieval, Weston records the dwindling financial support for medieval programmes of study in the US, and criticises neoliberal models of higher education. Eileen Joy notes that Weston's contributions asks academics to reconsider the role \\"of pleasure in Old English studies within the context of the California budget crisis and its possibly tragic impact upon medieval studies within higher education there\\".  Selected publications  Weston published \\"Women's Medicine, Women's Magic: The Old English Metrical Childbirth Charms\\", in the journal Modern Philology, Volume 92, Number 3, February 1995. This article was reprinted in the 2016 reader Old English Literature: A Guide to Criticism with Selected Readings edited by John Niles and published by Wiley-Blackwell. Weston's chapter \\"Saintly lives: friendship, kinship, gender and sexuality\\" features in the Cambridge History of Early Medieval English Literature edited by Clare Lees in 2013. Her chapter \\"Elegiac desire and female community in Baudonivia's Life of Saint Radegund\\" was published in Same Sex Love and Desire Among Women in the Middle Ages, edited by Francesca Canad√© Sautman and Pamela Sheingorn and published by Palgrave in 2001.

This map shows how air travels to the pollution monitor in Newport State Park.Photo of the monitoring station on p. 128 of Because the monitor is near the shore, only the red lines (which show the lower air currents) meaningfully depict the path of ozone to the monitor. As shown on the map, these lower currents carry polluted air from major urban areas. But further inland, the air from higher up mixes more, so all color lines are significant when tracing the path of air pollution further inland. These higher currents (shown in green and blue) blow in from cleaner, mostly rural areas. The stability of air over the Lake Michigan shore along with the lake breezes may increase the concentration of ozone along the shoreline.Relations between Meteorology and Ozone in the Lake Michigan Breeze by Steven R.

The newest is in a relatively shallow layer of sand and gravel, but tends to not to provide enough water except in the southeastern part of the county. Further down are layers of dolomite bedrock that are recharged by water percolating from the layer of sand and gravel. Past the dolomite is a layer of shale that does not contain water, although potentially it is a source of oil. Past the shale is a layer of sandstone that is also host to a bedrock aquifer. Only a few wells tap this deepest and oldest aquifer.Geology and ground water in Door County, Wisconsin, with emphasis on contamination potential in the Silurian dolomite by M.G.

A study of three city wells serving Sturgeon Bay found that water from the surface fell anywhere from 13 to 115 feet per day from the surface down to the dolomite aquifer. When the snow melted in the spring, the water coming up from one well changed 9 days later to reflect the character of the new meltwater.Field Verification of Capture Zones for Municipal Wells at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin by Kenneth R.

History On 16 May 2020, Kate Bingham was named to chair the body. On 1 July, Bingham told the Science and Technology Select Committee that Sarah Gilbert and \\"Oxford University (are) leading the world in developing a vaccine against Covid-19 and offers the best chance of having something protective against the virus as we go into winter.\\" On 12 September, it came to light that Sir John Bell was a member of the body. On 14 October, the chairman managed public expectation by stating that a vaccine for COVID-19 is expected to be no more efficacious than the flu vaccine which immunises against the influenza virus with around 50 per cent success. Kate Bingham added: \\"We shouldn't assume it's going to be better than a flu vaccine, because that's an equivalent ‚Äì it's a mutating ‚Ä¶ respiratory virus that gets in through the nose and eyes and respiratory tract.\\" Speaking to BBC Scotland's The Seven on 17 October, Kate Bingham said that the government would have to arrive at an agreement with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) as to how any COVID-19 vaccine should be distributed; the staff of care homes and the elderly are likely to be prioritised. The chair also revealed that initially, there will only be a limited supply any COVID-19 vaccine. On 18 October 2020, SAGE committee member, Sir Jeremy Farrar, commented on Sophy Ridge On Sunday that the Vaccine Taskforce \\"has done an absolutely extraordinary job\\" and the country is in an \\"extraordinarily strong position\\" with regard to the lineup of possible vaccines.

Gentry authored an early work applying the term intelligence to plants. Biography Gentry was born in Holmesburg, Philadelphia.The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans, Volume 4. Boston: The Biographical Society, 1904. In 1861, he entered the profession of teaching in Philadelphia. He was elected principal of Southwest Boys' Grammar School in 1884. He married Mary Shoemaker on December 27, 1864. He received the Sc.D. from Chicago College of Science in 1888. Gentry resided in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Gentry was an elected member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Canadian Entomological Society and the Nuttall Ornithological Club. He authored scientific articles in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences and The Auk. Gentry expressed interest in Walt Whitman's poetry and exchanged letters with him. Works =Life-Histories of the Birds of Eastern Pennsylvania= Gentry authored the two-volume Life-Histories of the Birds of Eastern Pennsylvania. The work was based on his personal observations of birds in Eastern Pennsylvania. Gentry described the habits and songs of different bird species, characteristics of their nests, periods of incubation and food. A review in the Quarterly Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club praised the careful studies of Gentry but commented that \\"the chief defect of the book is its unprepossessing typographical appearance, printer's blunders of every description abounding, while the paper and type are wholly unworthy of so valuable a work.\\" It was positively reviewed in the Canadian Entomologist who \\"heartily commend[ed] it to all our readers who are in any way interested in ornithology.\\" The Field and Forest journal liked the first volume and described Gentry as a \\"true lover of nature, as well as a minute observer.\\" A supportive review of the second volume in The American Journal of Science and Arts suggested that \\"the author has evidently spent a great amount of time and labor in making and recording observations of this kind\\". The second volume was also positively reviewed in the Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club which concluded that \\"Mr. Gentry is evidently a friend and admirer of the feathered tribes, and often describes their habits most minutely, especially in relation to their nidification. Despite some faults of execution, the work before us contributes much of value respecting the habits of our birds, and records many interesting points in their history not given by previous writers.\\" In 1912, many years after Gentry's volumes were published, a hostile review in The Auk accused Gentry of fabricating his records of bird food. Gentry stated in his preface to his first volume that he had examined the stomachs of 700 birds to identify their food habits. The reviewer took issue with this and noted that Gentry had listed from 20‚Äì50 animal or vegetable items of food for many different bird species but such a great variety of items is suspect and that an obtrusive feature of Gentry's data is the recurrence of the same insect names over and over again. The reviewer concluded that the book is a \\"dangerous mixture of fact and unfact\\" and Gentry's records of bird food are \\"almost entirely products of the author's imagination.\\" =Nests and Eggs of Birds of the United States= Gentry authored Nests and Eggs of Birds of the United States, in 1882. The book deals exclusively with American oology. It was positively reviewed in The American Naturalist who concluded \\"we take this opportunity to recommend this elegant work for every library.\\" Conversely, Clinton Hart Merriam negatively reviewed it as a \\"popular picture book, well adapted for the amusement of children\\". The book featured beautiful artwork such as 50 paintings of North American birds, eggs and nests by Edwin Sheppard. It is now a collector's item and worth over $1,350.Henderson, Carrol L. (2007). Oology and Ralph's Talking Eggs: Bird Conservation Comes Out of Its Shell. University of Texas Press. p. 29. =Intelligence in Plants and Animals= Gentry authored Life and Immortality: Or, Souls in Plants and Animals, in 1897 which argued for animal and plant consciousness. Several years later it was republished as Intelligence in Plants and Animals by Doubleday. Gentry believed that all animals and plants have a soul and will survive death. Historian Ed Folsom described it as \\"an exhaustive investigation of how such animals as bees, ants, worms and buzzards, as well as all kinds of plants, display intelligence and thus have souls\\". The book argued that even the \\"lower animals\\" will have \\"a future life, where they will receive a just compensation for the sufferings which so many of them undergo in this world.\\" Gentry believed that the doctrine of immortality for animals would lead to a more humane treatment. A review in The Nation suggested the book was marred by evidences of too much credulity but \\"the propositions are supported by many facts, a large amount of assumption, a lot of reasoning, and an abundance of revelation, which together necessitate the exercise of a great deal of faith.\\" The book was positively reviewed in The Journal of Practical Metaphysics as a \\"particular value to all who are interested in the signs of intelligence in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\\" Selected publications *On Habits of Some American Species of Birds (1874) *Life-Histories of the Birds of Eastern Pennsylvania (1876) *The House Sparrow at Home and Abroad (1878) *Nests and Eggs of Birds of the United States (1882) *Family Names from the Irish, Anglo-Saxon, Anglo-Norman and Scotch Considered in Relation to Their Etymology (1892) *Pigeon River and Other Poems (1892) *Life and Immortality: Or, Souls in Plants and Animals (1897) *Intelligence in Plants and Animals (1900) References Category:1843 births Category:1905 deaths Category:19th-century American educators Category:19th-century American non-fiction writers Category:American nature writers Category:American naturalists Category:American ornithological writers Category:American ornithologists Category:Animal ethicists Category:Animal rights scholars ","title":"Thomas G.

Life  = Provenance and early years = Johann Bernhard Ferdinand J√ºhlke, the third of his parents' three recorded sons together, was born on 1 September 1815 and baptised 16 days later, at Barth (Pomerania), in the extreme north of what would become Germany. Johann Martin J√ºhlke, his father, was a carpenter-joiner. The year of his birth was the year in which the entire province of Swedish Pomerania ceased to be Swedish and became part of Prussia, as part of the process whereby the nation- brokers at the Congress of Vienna confirmed the nation's recovery of \\"great power\\" status and the reversal of its near annihilation by the French Empire in 1806. J√ºhlke's parents divorced soon after he was born and his father remarried, following which the boys acquired a half-sister in 1818. Ferdinand J√ºhlke attended the \\"B√ºrgerschule\\" (secondary school) in his home town where he received a basic education. Of more lasting significance was the education he received from his uncle who worked as the head gardener at a nearby manor house. He quickly schooled the boy in the practical aspects of gardening and also succeeded in instilling in his nephew a fascination with gardening and pomology. In 1830 J√ºhlke embarked on a more formal training programme at the Greifswald Botanic Garden of the University of Greifswald, a short distance to the south-east. The young course director, Professor Christian Friedrich Hornschuch, was keen to combine academic and botanical instruction with the aesthetic and artistic aspects of horticulture, both in his approach to teaching and in the way he had the gardens arranged. Hornschuch only launched the course, formally, in 1831. As one of its first students, J√ºhlke complemented his course work with his own extensive programme of private reading and self-study. Keen to master the intellectual context of his chosen speciality, his self-structured programme of complementary education included private tutoring in Botanic sciences, Physics, Maths and Quantitative Measurement.H. Gaerdt: Joh. Bernh. Ferd. J√ºhlke ‚Ä†. In: Gartenflora - Zeitschrift f√ºr Garten- und Blumenkunde. 42. Jahrgang, Verlag von Paul Parey, Berlin 1893, pp. 481‚Äì484 During his time in Greifswald J√ºhlke developed a particular friendship with Johann Gottfried Langguth, the head gardener at the Botanic Garden between 1822 and 1855. Langguth, whom Professor Hornschuch also held in the highest regard, became for J√ºhlke an important longstanding counsellor and mentor. = Royal Agricultural Academy Eldena (1834-1854) = Recommended by Professor Hornschuch, in 1834 J√ºhlke was offered and accepted the position of \\"Academic Gardener\\" at the Royal Agricultural Academy Eldena. He was thereby placed in charge of a prestigious teaching and research academy, newly established by the university on the site of a former monastery (which had fallen into ruin since dissolution in 1535). Over a number of years took the opportunity to build up a Botanic Garden and a Pomology academy. There was also scope to develop an extensive horticultural research facility. The facilities provided institutional and practical support for teaching horticulture and plant care, supported by students who created and helped maintain appropriate herbaria and plant collections. He also organised an extensive programme of plant breeding trials, testing out new cultivars and methods. He established and maintained close relations with major commercial garden businesses, nurseries and botanic gardens, from which he obtained plant samples and seeds in order to try out new varieties and form conclusions as to their suitability for the climate found in the North German coastal regions.Ferdinand J√ºhlke: Mittheilungen aus dem Gebiete des Gartenwesens der K√∂nigl. staats- und landwirthschaftlichen Akademie Eldena. In: Allgemeine Landwirthschaftliche Monatsschrift. vol. 5, 1841, pp. 38‚Äì53. At the beginning of his time in charge the focus was simply on teaching students the practicalities of garden development and maintenance, with a focus on fruit trees and grafting techniques. During the winter term of 1843/44 J√ºhlke started providing students with lectures on horticulture, and in 1846 he took on the newly created teaching chair in Horticulture. This enabled him to establish the Department of Horticulture as a stand-alone facility at the academy. By this time J√ºhlke was also sharing his expertise in horticulture with numerous contributions to specialist journals, through engagement in agricultural associations and participation in exhibitions. He became involved with the \\"Baltischen Verein zur F√∂rderung der Landwirtschaft\\" (\\"Baltic Association for the Support of Agriculture\\"), and in 1845 became a founder member of the \\"Horticultural Association of New Western Pomerania and R√ºgen\\", himself serving as secretary of the association till 1858. Fairly soon after taking over at Eldena, J√ºhlke met Otto von Bismarck, who had welcomed the opportunity to attend the Eldena Academy as part of his military service. As a young man Bismarck evidently believed that his future would involve inheriting and then improving and managing the extensive family agricultural estates on which he had grown up. Their meeting turned out to be the start of a life-long friendship. The men's surviving correspondence indicates that Bismarck would always retain a lively interest in horticultural matters, and that he would frequently seek advice on them from his former teacher at the Eldena Academy. J√ºhlke also found time, during this period, to broaden his horticultural education through study trips. The longest of these appear to be the ones he undertook in 1844 and 1853. The first of these took in Germany and Belgium while the second covered England, Scotland, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and the southern parts of Germany. In 1854 J√ºhlke accepted a government appointment as \\"Royal Inspector of Horticulture\\". He resigned this government post four years later, also in 1858 turning down the offer of a job as Director of the vast Imperial Botanical Gardens in Tiflis. Near-contemporary sources suggest that his decision on the matter was taken for \\"family reasons\\". His elder daughter had been born in 1852 and his son in 1856. It was also in 1856 that J√ºhlke published the first scientific description of the Pommerscher Krummstiel (apple), which at one stage became the most popular apple species in the region. There are suggestions that the apples, which may have originated on the Island of R√ºgen, were being cultivated (unclassified) in Mecklenburg at least as early as 1800.) =Nurseryman / businessman in Erfurt (1858-1866) = Instead he moved south within Germany, taking over the C. Appelius commercial nursery business in the centrally located Andreasvorstadt quarter of Erfurt which, like his home region, had become part of Prussia in 1815. The business had been founded by Carl Appelius in 1834, but under the direction of Ferdinand J√ºhlke it now expanded rapidly, soon becoming one of Erfurt's most economically successful horticulture businesses.Waltraud R√ºdiger-Wittler: Zur Topographie und wirtschaftlichen Bedeutung der Erfurter Gartenbauunternehmen. In: Verein f√ºr die Geschichte und Altertumskunde von Erfurt e.V. (Hrsg.), Steffen Ra√üloff (Hrsg.), Martin Baumann (Hrsg.): Blumenstadt Erfurt: Waid - Gartenbau - iga/egapark; Sutton- Verlag, Erfurt 2011, , pp. 203‚Äì207. Following his arrival in Erfurt he also undertook a large amount of networking and voluntary work. In 1860, just two years after taking control of the C. Appelius business, he had been elected director of the Erfurt Horticulture Association. That same year, on 23 May, he was accepted as member of the city's Carl zu den drei Adlern Masonic lodge. He also became a member of the Erfurt city council and was appointed a district tax commissioner in respect of Land Tax During these eight years in the private sector J√ºhlke again found time for the occasional extended study trip abroad. The most extensive of these appears to have been in 1860, when he visited Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary and Silesia. He visited, in particular, various horticulture businesses in order to gather ideas for his own undertaking in Erfurt. Characteristically, he expended a huge amount of energy and commitment in developing his business, which evidently did not go unnoticed. In 1862 the king granted him the honour of becoming an [official] provider of royal garden supplies, seeds and plants.J√ºrgen Zerull: Entwicklung der Erfurter Gartenschauen. Ein Abriss. In: Verein f√ºr die Geschichte und Altertumskunde von Erfurt e.V. (compiler-producer), Steffen Ra√üloff (compiler- producer), Martin Baumann (compiler-producer)): Blumenstadt Erfurt: Waid - Gartenbau - iga/egapark; Sutton-Verlag, Erfurt 2011, , pp. 208‚Äì222. In June 1864 he was appointed Commissar of the Hamburg-based German Agriculture Society (\\"Deutsche Ackerbau-Gesellschaft\\") and elected President of the Jury for agricultural products. As chairman of the Erfurt Horticulture Association, J√ºhlke took a lead in organising the German Exhibition of Agricultural and Horticultural Products (den ...\\"Allgemeinen deutschen Ausstellung von Produkten des Land- und Gartenbaues\\"). The exhibition was held between 9 and 17 September 1865 in Erfurt, having been scheduled to coincide with the \\"Second Congress of German Gardeners, Botanists and Garden-enthusiasts for resolving Important Questions in Horticulture\\" (also held in Erfurt). The overall organiser of the event was another leading figure among Erfurt's commercial horticulturalists, Franz Carl Heinemann, though it is hard to discern from the sources whether or how far Heinemann's remit extended to the exhibition organised by J√ºhlke. Because of the huge international success of the exhibition, the Ministry for Agriculture conferred on Franz Carl Heinemann the title \\"Royal Prussian Director of Horticulture\\" (\\"K√∂niglich Preu√üischer Gartenbaudirektor\\") later the same year. These event were followed by a spectacular and very personal falling out between J√ºhlke and Heinemann, as a result of which J√ºhlke took the decision to resign his office as Director of the Erfurt Horticulture Association, which he did at the end of 1865. = Director of the Garden of the Royal Court and associated directorships (1866-1891)= Peter Joseph Lenn√©, the respected director of the Garden of the Royal Court, died in January 1866. The king appointed Ferdinand J√ºhlke to fill the vacancy with effect from 1 April 1866. J√ºhlke's responsibilities now included administration, care and maintenance of royal gardens throughout the Kingdom of Prussia, not only in the region surrounding the royal residence Potsdam, but also in the Rhine Province and, after 1868, Hessen, far to the west. J√ºhlke's new job also included directorship of the Royal Arboreal College at Alt-Geltow and of the Royal Horticultural College on the Potsdam Wildlife Park. The Erfurt nursery business was taken over by Carl Putz, who had worked there for many years. The change was subject to the business trading as \\"F. J√ºhlke Nachfolger\\" (\\"F. J√ºhlke, Successor\\"). As successor to Peter Joseph Lenn√©, J√ºhlke implemented fundamental reforms at the Royal Horticultural College. The nineteenth century was one of massive political, economic and social change across Germany. One generally unremarked aspect of the changes was the way that Horticulture developed, by the 1860s no longer a mere footnote to Agriculture, but an important free-standing component in a modern rapidly expanding national economy. The academic study of Horticulture had to take account the changed requirements that resulted. One change for which the college urgently needed to adapt included the increasing specialisation within the commercial horticulture sector. There was no automatic overlap between a business that specialised in ornamental and exotic indoor plants, one that focused on vegetables or pomology, and one devoted to identifying and cultivating medicinal plants. He also restructured the nearby Alt-Geltow Royal Arboreal College to make it more responsive to market requirements, during a period in which intellectuals and other opinion formers were rediscovering a German woodland heritage - part real: part imagined - possibly in response to accelerating industrialisation and urbanisation. As director at the Garden of the Royal Court, J√ºhlke's work involved planning, organising and supervising designs and redesigns for royal gardens and the gardens of the nobility. He also found his services were much in demand as a planner of numerous municipal and private gardens. Examples include the garden-park surrounding the villa in Eisenach of his friend, the Mecklenburg popular novelist and poet Fritz Reuter. During the 1870s and 1880s he designed several municipal facilities for Barth (his birth town), which at the time was undergoing rapid expansion as a commercial port and brewing town. In Stralsund, the regional capital nearby, he was instrumental in implementing a long-standing ambition of many city-folk by constructing an impressive network of public parks and landscaped walkways. The development was made possible by the decommissioning, for serious defensive purposes, of the city's massive ramparts which had been constructed and then progressively extended through the centuries during which Stralsund was much fought over (most recently) between Poland, Pomerania, Brandenburg-Prussia, Sweden, France and others. =Later years= In 1880 J√ºhlke ended his teaching activities at the Royal Horticultural College. Two years later, on 26 October 1882 he accepted honorary membership of the Potsdam \\"Teutonia zur Weisheit\\" masonic lodge. On 1 April 1884 he celebrated fifty years of service in gardening and horticulture, and in 1891 the twenty-fifth anniversary of his service as director of the Garden of the Royal Court. On 1 July of that year, aged 75, he retired from his remaining positions. He died at Potsdam a little under two years later.  Memberships  During his career Ferdinand J√ºhlke accumulated a number of memberships of horticultural and natural history clubs and associations. These included the German Pomology Association and the Erfurt-based Royal Academy of Charitable Sciences. Widely respected by fellow horticulturalists and scholars, he became a frequent presence at national and international horticulture festivals and garden exhibitions, judging and moderating the competitions.  Family  Ferdinand J√ºhlke married Maria Johanna Caroline Bladt (1817-1899) on 14 May 1841. The bride was the daughter of a dance teacher. She came (like her husband) from Barth. The marriage was followed by the births of the couple's three recorded children: * Betty was born on 17 January 1852. She died \\"in childbirth\\" on 18 December 1882, following the birth of her own first child. * Carl Ludwig was born on 6 September 1856, and initially studied law. He later reinvented himself as an \\"Africa explorer\\" and was killed - some sources use the word \\"murdered\\" - in Kismayo. The early loss of J√ºhlke's son was followed by a powerful letter of condolence from his long- standing friend, the horticulture enthusiast, Chancellor Bismarck. * Margarethe was born in 1861.

It was published by Harper & Row in the United States in 1970 and in 1969, by Hodder and Stoughton in England as The Etruscan Net. It was Gilbert's 14th novel and takes place entirely in Florence, Italy, a few years after the great flood of the Arno river in 1966, which caused serious damage in the city. Gilbert had a great fondness for Italy, which was the setting for a number of his books. One of these is his other well-known novel Death in Captivity, a harrowing mystery based on Gilbert's time in an Italian prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. Apart from Death in Captivity and The Family Tomb, however, most of Gilbert's other books have only a portion of their events taking place in Italy. The Family Tomb occurs entirely within a few miles of the Ponte Vecchio and central Florence. Plot Unlike many of Gilbert's novels, which have plots within plots and apparently disparate themes that eventually merge, The Family Tomb is a straightforward suspense story involving only members of the British colony in Florence. They include a wealthy Etruscan professor who excavates and sells ancient art objects, Italian police and judiciary officials, assorted politicians and lawyers, sympathetic Italian working-class people, and two sinister Mafia figures. The protagonist, Robert Broke, a middle-aged Englishman and expert on Etruscan art, lives in Florence in a state of semi-suspension, having never fully recovered emotionally from the sudden deaths of his wife and child in England several years earlier. He runs a bookstore and art gallery and is on friendly, if somewhat distant terms, with the other members of the British colony. He is attached to his youthful housekeeper and her elderly father, who is a marvelous craftsman in restoring broken antiques. Broke is invited to an elaborate luncheon at the country estate of Professor Bronzini, where excavations into ancient Etruscan tombs are ongoing. Broke encounters the very different members of Bronzini's peculiar household and is shown some of the excavations and ancient tombs. Without quite realizing it, he catches a glimpse of something that he shouldn't have seen‚Äîapparently an ancient Etruscan's helmet‚Äîand from that point onward his well-being becomes in danger. Within a few days, the elderly craftsman who works for Broke is killed by an apparent hit-and-run driver late one evening‚Äîand Broke himself is arrested, put into jail and accused of killing the man.The rest of the book dwells on attempts by a devoted band of British expatriates to free him and their experience with the Italian legal and political system that weaves its mesh around Broke, and vicious counter-moves by Mafia gangsters who hope to ensure that Broke's arrest will lead to his conviction so that the shadowy deeds taking place on Professor Bronzini's estate are left in peace. Fortunately for Broke, a few Italian officials are less committed to gaining a guilty plea than others. Moreover, an extremely clever local lawyer takes up his case, and on his side is a gilded youth with special talents, who is also the adopted son of Professor Bronzini, and a giant Corsican handyman who works for the Professor. As is frequently the case with Gilbert books, there is a violent d√©nouement with a satisfactory number of corpses‚Äîwhich leads to a newly found interest in life, on the part of Broke. Reception The book was released to mixed critical response. > The New York Times wrote, \\"There is a bit more to be said, however, for the > non‚Äìseries novel, a more exacting task, demanding the development, each > time, of a new structure, new images, new milieu, fresh basic > characterization.

Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist who often goes by the pseudonym '. He is the founder of what he calls the in Akihabara, where he spends most of his time and has dubbed himself Lab Member No. 001 (as he is the first person to join). As he experiments with time travel, he learns that he is the only one who possesses the ability to determine changes between different timelines, which he dubs \\"Reading Steiner\\". He is 18 years old and a first-year student at Tokyo Denki University. Besides Steins;Gate, Okabe has been present in other games from the Science Adventure franchise. He is voiced by Mamoru Miyano in Japanese and J. Michael Tatum in English. Critical response to Okabe has been positive due to his traits as a scientist and his darker characterization in Steins;Gate 0. Creation and development Tatsuya Matsubara created the Okabe with the idea of how he grows to care for others in the narrative and goes on a journey to save them. He aimed to connect Okabe's traits with the player's feelings not only by gameplay but also by the content of the narrative, most notably in the form the relationship he forms. To express the character's struggles of trying in regards to how Okabe aims to save the world, Matsubara said it was necessary for the team to create a game structure that was a little jarring. He was concerned the players might not be able to clear the game, relying on that collective intelligence. As a result, Matsubara received a report that players were able to clear the game within the first week. At the time, it was expected in Japan to dig a little deeper into the characters after a visual novel game was released in the form of another product. Although STEINS;GATE did follow this, it was not his intention to have the players experience the struggle of witnessing the serious Okabe in the main text. If I did, I felt like that would thin out the main text. He aimed to give Okabe an uncommon scenario in sci-fi storytelling, expecting the players to be surprised as well. Geraint Evans stated that while Okabe is well explored in the anime, the visual novel gave fans the chance to understand the relationship between Mayuri and Okabe much better than in the anime. In one of the spin-off games, a large influence on his scenario was the anime series Code Geass (2006‚Äì2007), with the character Lelouch Lamperouge influencing Okabe's \\"wannabe bad guy\\" characterization. In Japanese, Okabe is voiced by Mamoru Miyano. J. Michael Tatum plays the character in English dubs and had to change different parts of Miyano's take when doing commentaries so that Western audiences would understand Okabe's explanations. Appearances =In Steins;Gate= On July 28, 2010, Rintaro Okabe and his friend Mayuri Shiina head towards the Radio Kaikan building for a conference, where Rintaro finds a girl named Kurisu Makise lying in a pool of blood.Translated quote: \\"Everybody's faces turned pale white upon seeing Kurisu's body.\\" As Rintaro sends a text message about the incident to his friend, Itaru \\"Daru\\" Hashida, he experiences a strange phenomenon and the people around him disappear, with no one else noticing anything had changed.Translated quote: \\"Just now, thousands of pedestrians disappeared in an instant! You saw it too, right!? / I didn't see anything. Now hurry up and leave.\\" After later running into Kurisu, who is strangely alive and well, and discovering the message he had sent to Itaru had arrived a week before he sent it,Translated quote: \\"You should be dead! Why are you here...!?\\" Translated quote: \\"Well, you sent me a message like that a week ago, no?\\" Rintaro soon deduces that the 'Mobile Microwave' he and his friends had been developing is, in fact, a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past.Translated quote: \\"The mail was sent to the \\"past\\".\\" He and his friends soon learn that SERN, an organization that has been researching time travel for some time, has actually succeeded in sending humans into the past although they seem to have all resulted in the test subjects' deaths. Rintaro begins experimenting with , which begin to cause major differences in the timeline. Kurisu also manages to create a device to send a person's memories through the microwave, allowing that person to effectively leap into the past. =In Steins;Gate 0= The game begins during Steins;Gate ending, where Suzuha traveled to August 21, 2010 using her time machine to get Okabe to prevent a time-travel arms race leading to World War III; to do this, he needs to stop Kurisu's father, Doctor Nakabachi, from killing Kurisu and bringing her time travel theories to Russia. Suzuha brings Okabe to the moment of the murder, July 28, 2010, but he accidentally kills Kurisu himself due to world-line convergence. Upon returning to the present, Okabe refuses Suzuha's requests to try again, and develops post-traumatic stress disorder. Nearly five months later, Okabe attends Kurisu's coworkers Maho and Leskinen's presentation of their Amadeus system, which uses digitized memories as artificial intelligence avatars; one avatar has been made based on Kurisu. Speaking with them, Okabe becomes a tester for Amadeus, allowing him to communicate with Amadeus Kurisu through his phone. While trying to change Okabe's mind, Suzuha looks for Kagari, who got separated when traveling to 1998. Maho, who has Kurisu's hard drive, wants to access her theories, hoping to be able to save Kurisu; Russia, other countries, and groups including SERN are also after the theories, and the world line shifts as they monitor activities surrounding Kurisu's theories and memories. =In Steins;Gate: The Movie ‚àí Load Region of D√©j√† Vu= After going through a painstaking journey across multiple 'World Lines' due to the invention of 'D-Mail', text messages that can be sent to the past, Rintaro Okabe has assumedly landed in the \\"Steins Gate\\" World Line, in which he was able to prevent the deaths of both Mayuri Shiina and Kurisu Makise, as well as prevent a future ruled by SERN due to the invention of a time machine that no longer exists. On August 3, Kurisu arrives in Japan for a press conference and reunites with all the members of the Future Gadget Laboratory. Meanwhile, Rintaro starts having intense side effects from his time travels, seeing visions of alternate Worldlines. The next day on August 4, a mysterious visitor shows up at Kurisu's hotel, telling her to remember three things: a cell phone, a microwave oven, and SERN. Later that day, as Kurisu is talking to Rintaro about how her own instances of d√©j√† vu may be similar to Rintaro's 'Reading Steiner' ability to remember things from other World Lines, Rintaro suddenly disappears before Kurisu's eyes. Furthermore, no one else seems to remember Rintaro ever existed, with Kurisu barely retaining a faint memory of someone. =Steins;Gate: My Darling's Embrace= Rintaro Okabe's main problem is paying the bills for the laboratory, having to take a part-time job as a waiter. The game has multiple routes, each focusing on Okabe building a romantic relationship with one of the characters from Steins;Gate. The player affects the direction of the plot by picking choices, by answering Okabe's phone, and by clicking on highlighted text within text messages on the phone. Reception In the 2013 \\"Newtype anime awards\\", Okabe won the best male anime character category. Seaside Tapes owner referred Mr Ocean referred to Okabe as a major inspiration to the MTX alias. Critical reception to the character in the visual novel has been positive. Destructoid praised Okabe's character and his relationship with the rest of the cast based on how appealing they were, with Siliconera preferring the one he starts with Kurisu based on the comical interactions. USGamer acclaimed Okabe as \\"one of the most fascinating lead characters I've[the reviewer] enjoyed the company of in quite some time\\" based on the handling of his character and the voice provided by Mamoru Miyano. In another review, GamesTm stated that Okabe deconstructs the ideas for a scientist in a positive fashion due to how he avoids steretotypical traits seen in fiction comparing him \\"Rick And Morty‚Äôs titular professor more than any other genre rival\\". IGN felt the bonds Okabe has with his friends were also appealing when talking about multiple subjects based on different types of ideas to help his dialogue be easier to understand. Nate Ming of Crunchyroll criticized the character, stating Okabe \\"is by far one of the most genuinely unlikable protagonists\\". Critics also commented on Okabe's darker characterization from Steins;Gate 0. Crunchyroll stated that while his appearance has not changed with the exception of his black coat, Okabe shows signs of suffering posttraumatic disorder and depression as a result of Kurisu's death. As a result, the site found Okabe's new personality as unique as Okabe still has not recovered from Kurise' death and how the plot handles his weakness. Jenni Lada from Siliconera stated that while at first she did not like Okabe's character, finding him \\"obnoxious and unrealistic at the outset of the adventure\\", she instead found the depressed Okabe more interesting. She cited how weak Okabe is portrayed in the sequel, finding him as a person in need of theraphy but cannot find recovery through it. Destructoid referred to him as the most changed character due to his lack of crazy demeanor and that did not care about the future of his life in a possible World War III. Despite the dark narrative, Carden still found Okabe and Maho had segment that could produce a laughter. Hardcore Gamer found that players might be affected by how Okabe passes his free time interacting with an AI based on Kurisu, something that might instead hurt him rather than recover from his trauma. In regards to the anime adaptation of the visual novels, DVD Talk enjoyed Okabe's character arc as he becomes a more realistic person across the story. Pierce Drew at The Fandom Post regarded Okabe as having \\"massive, spotlighting personality\\" due his \\"mad scientist\\" actions like delivering laughs in a chaotic manner regardless of voice actor. THEM Anime Reviews that while time travelling stories are common in anime, the studio instead made the anime as \\"about Okabe Rintarou\\"; The reviewer said described that Okabe as a \\"childish, nonsense spouting but occasionally brilliant\\" who despite having a weak characterization, he still develops as a character similar to what DVD Talk claimed. The critic also praised the relationship Okabe has with Kurisu, stating they have \\"chemistry\\" despite both of them acting as tsundere while also enjoying the way the protagonist also bonds with his childhood friend Mayuri. As the movie focused solely on Okabe and Kurisu, Richard Eisenbeis and Toshi Nakamura of Kotaku stated, \\"This movie really lives or dies on how well you connect to Kurisu and Okabe‚Äî and given the amazing performances of their voice actors, I can't imagine not being able to\\". In regards to Steins;Gate 0, Anime News Network praised how aware was the series in regards to the depressed Okabe interacted with the AI Amadeus as a fellow character insists the real Kurisu is dead and thus, the more Okabe talks with Amadeus, the more it will hurt him to face the reality without the woman he loved.

The eighteenth named storm, and seventh hurricane of the extremely active, record breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Sally formed out of an area of disturbed weather which was first monitored over the Bahamas on September 10\\\\. The system grew a broad area of low-pressure on September 11, and was designated as a tropical depression at late that day. Early the next day, the depression made landfall at Key Biscayne, and subsequently strengthened into Tropical Storm Sally that afternoon. Moderate northwesterly shear prevented significant intensification for the first two days, but convection continued to grow towards the center and Sally slowly intensified. On September 14, a center reformation into the center of the convection occurred, and data from a hurricane hunter reconnaissance aircraft showed that Sally rapidly intensified into a strong Category 1 hurricane. It further intensified into a Category 2 hurricane that evening. However, an increase in wind shear and upwelling of colder waters weakened Sally slightly back down to Category 1 on September 15\\\\. Despite this increase in wind shear, it unexpectedly re-intensified, reaching Category 2 status again early on September 16 before making landfall at peak intensity at 09:45 UTC on September 16 near Gulf Shores, Alabama, with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). The storm rapidly weakened after landfall, becoming a remnant low early the next day. Numerous watches and warnings were issued in anticipation of the imminent approach of Sally and several coastline counties and parishes on the Gulf Coast were evacuated. In South Florida, heavy rain led to localized flash flooding while the rest of peninsula saw continuous shower and thunderstorm activity due to asymmetric structure of Sally. The area between Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, took the brunt of the storm with widespread wind damage, storm surge flooding, and over of rainfall. Several tornadoes also occurred as well. Damage totals are estimated to be at least $5 billion and at least eight fatalities have been confirmed. Meteorological history At 00:00 UTC on September 10, the NHC began to monitor an area of disturbed weather over the Bahamas for possible development. Over the next two days, convection rapidly increased, became better organized, and formed a broad area of low-pressure on September 11. At 21:00 UTC, the system had organized enough to be designated as Tropical Depression Nineteen. At 06:00 UTC on September 12, the depression made landfall at Key Biscayne, with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and a pressure of 1007 mbar (29.74 inHg). Shortly after moving into the Gulf of Mexico, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Sally at 18:00 UTC the same day, becoming the earliest 18th tropical or subtropical storm in an Atlantic hurricane season, surpassing the old mark of October 2, which was previously set by Hurricane Stan in 2005. As Sally moved north-northwestard, northerwesterly shear from a nearby upper-level low caused the system to have a sheared appearance, but it continued to strengthen as it gradually moved north-northwestward. As shear relaxed some, a huge burst of convection and a center reformation caused Sally to rapidly intensify into a hurricane by 16:00 UTC on September 14 with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a pressure of 985 mb (29.09 inHg). It later intensified into a 100 mph (155 km/h) Category 2 hurricane five hours later, although its pressure had risen to 987 mb (29.15 inHg). Hurricane Sally approaching the northern Gulf Coast on the afternoon of September 15. This increase in strength did not last long as six hours later, a slight increase in wind shear and upwelling of colder waters caused by the storm's slow motion weakened Sally back to a Category 1 storm early the next day. Despite its weakening, Sally began to develop a ragged eye, as shown on radar imagery, although it was open on its southern side. Sally continued to slowly weaken as it slowed down tremendously and meandered first before turning northward, moving at only . Although its pressure continued to fall, hurricane hunter aircraft reported that wind speeds continued to drop. As Sally approached the coast, however, its eye quickly became better defined and it abruptly began to reintensify. By 05:00 UTC on September 16, the storm had reintensified back into a Category 2 hurricane and was still strengthening. The storm then reached its peak intensity at 08:00 UTC with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a pressure of 965 mbars (28.50 inHg). Sally maintained its intensity before making its final landfall at around 09:45 UTC near Gulf Shores, Alabama. Sally's eye quickly disappeared as the storm rapidly weakened while it moved slowly inland. It was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane at 13:00 UTC and to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC. It further weakened to a tropical depression at 03:00 UTC on September 17 before degenerating into a remnant low at 15:00 UTC. The remnants continued northeastward off the coast of the Carolinas before losing its identity within a cold front around 18:00 UTC on September 18. Preparations Tropical Depression Nineteen shortly before formation on September 11\\\\. Due to the possibility of the storm making landfall as a tropical storm, a tropical storm watch was issued for the coast of Southeastern Florida from south of Jupiter Inlet to north of Ocean Reef when advisories were first issued at 21:00 UTC on September 11. At 03:00 UTC on September 12, another tropical storm watch was issued for the Florida panhandle from the Ochlockonee River to the Okaloosa/Walton County line. That same day, numerous storm surge, tropical storm, and hurricane watches were then issued for a large portion of the US Gulf Coast east of New Orleans at 21:00 UTC, three hours after Sally was named. Many of these watches were then upgraded to warnings at 09:00 UTC on September 13 with more watches and warnings issued in the hours that followed. Several tornado, flash flood, and flood watches were issued. States of emergency were declared in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama in preparation for Sally's arrival. Emergencies were also declared in the East Baton Rouge and St. Bernard parishes in Louisiana and Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida as well as New Orleans and Pensacola, Florida. =Louisiana= The mayor of New Orleans issued an evacuation for the unleaved area of the city due to storm surge while the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency for the entire state, which was still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Laura just three weeks earlier. Several parishes and areas were put under mandatory evacuation orders including all of St. Charles Parish, and parts of Orleans Parish, Jefferson Parish, Plaquemines Parish, and St. John the Baptist Parish. Shelters were opened while public school and university classes were cancelled throughout southeastern Louisiana for September 15. FEMA declared that they will be bringing additional resources to Louisiana for the storm's aftermath and not diverting resources away from Hurricane Laura's relief efforts. Lakeshore Drive along Lake Pontchartrain was closed before the storm as well. =Mississippi= U.S. Coast Guard preparing to launch a rescue boat for possible rescue operations. A state of emergency was declared on Sunday night, September 13, 2020. Mississippi governor Tate Reeves urged residents to prepare for Sally, which he said could produce up to of rain in the southern part of the state. Some shelters were opened, although officials urged people who were evacuating to stay with friends, relatives, or in hotels, if possible, because of the threat of coronavirus superspreading. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for parts of Harrison County and Hancock County. =Alabama= Alabama governor Kay Ivey closed all beaches on the coast and called for evacuations of low-lying and flood prone areas. Additionally, Dauphin Island mayor Jeff Collier strongly encouraged all people to evacuate the west end after water started to encroach on the main roadway. A state of emergency was declared by governor Kay Ivey on Monday September 14, 2020 as public schools and university classes were either cancelled or moved online in anticipation of the storm. Impact The re- intensification and sudden track to the east by Sally prior to landfall caught many by surprise. Additionally, its slow movement caused coastal areas between Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, to be in the northern eye wall for hours. Over 500,000 customers in Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, and Georgia lost power and parts of I-10, including the Escambia Bay Bridge, were shut down. Widespread tornado, special marine, severe thunderstorm, and flash flood warnings were issued, including several flash flood emergencies. =Florida= People after being rescued by a Coast Guard response team near Navarre, Florida. Due to the asymmetrical structure of Sally, almost all of Florida saw continuous shower and thunderstorm activity starting on September 12\\\\. A low- topped supercell in the outer rainbands of Sally prompted a tornado warning east of Tampa near Sebring on September 12. The next day, another storm prompted two tornado warnings in southwestern Lee County. Several special marine warnings were also issued for the Florida coast due to possible waterspouts. There was also a tornado reported in Marianna. Sally caused heavy rainfall and moderate flooding in South Florida and the Florida Keys, with nearly falling over Marathon, over in Key West and peaking at in Lower Matecumbe Key. Tropical storm-force gusts were reported in portions of the Miami metropolitan area. The Panhandle area suffered the brunt of the storm in Florida. In Escambia County, which includes Pensacola, the sheriff kept police deputies out helping residents \\"as long as physically possible\\". Tiger Point saw of rain, while Bellview saw . In Pensacola itself, over of rain fell and storm surge flooding reached , the third highest surge ever recorded in the city. Many streets were flooded and several parked cars were totaled when water got into their engines. Late on September 15, twenty two barges in the Pensacola Bay broke loose due to heavy surf. Five of the barges washed up near downtown while the sixth was involved in another collision. The seventh lodged itself underneath the Garcon Point Bridge while the final one became lodged underneath the Pensacola Bay Bridge, causing the bridge to be temporarily closed. The next morning, a crane fell onto the same bridge, destroying a portion of the roadway. The Florida Department of Transportation was unable to assess any possible damage to the bridge due to ongoing high winds. A water main break occurred in nearby Pensacola Beach, causing officials to advise residents to fill their bathtubs with water. The city of Panama City reported releases of raw sewage from several locations due to flooding from Hurricane Sally, prompting The Florida Department of Health to issue advises against swimming in Panama City until further notice. In Pensacola, a 27-year-old boater went missing and was later presumed dead when he left his home in a 12-foot jon, in an attempt to find his mother's pontoon boat that became untethered in the strong currents and whipping winds brought on by the hurricane. Another person in Pensacola also died after succumbing to carbon monoxide poisoning from indoor generator use. The body of another missing boater, a 45-year-old female kayaker who had also gone missing at the height of the storm, was discovered, marking the third fatality of Pensacola and the state of Florida. =Mississippi= Sally brought flooding to Mississippi, especially in Jackson County. At the peak of the storm, more than 10,000 people were without power along the gulf coast. Pascagoula police reported downed power lines and traffic lights in the city and a power outage on the eastern side of the city. Some parts of South Mississippi also reported downed trees and signs. Overall damage in Mississippi was expected to be much greater, but was reduced because the storm shifted east. =Alabama= Hurricane Sally shortly after landfall as seen on radar Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine agents survey damage caused by Hurricane Sally near Mobile, Ala., Sept. 16, 2020. Continuous onshore flow from Sally caused storm surge flooding to occur on Dauphin Island beginning early on September 14. Two unoccupied riverboat casinos in Bayou La Batre near Mobile broke loose due to the constant wave action with one of them hitting a dock. Fort Morgan, Alabama reported a wind gust of while Mobile reported a wind gust of . Major structural damage was recorded at the landfall point in Gulf Shores as well as Mobile. A pier in Gulf Shores that was destroyed in Hurricane Ivan in 2004 was partially destroyed again by storm surge from Sally just days after it had reopened following renovations. There were also several reports of damage to condos in the Gulf Shores with a few being destroyed. Meanwhile, in Downtown Mobile, a street light snapped, swinging wildly on its cable. A gas station was destroyed in Spanish Fort, Alabama. Several sewage overflows were reported across Mobile County following heavy rain from Hurricane Sally, causing contamination to Dog River and Rabbit Creek. One person was declared dead and one other missing in Orange Beach, an area most impacted by flooding. Another person died in Foley during the storm cleanup process. Over 2,000 broken poles and 4,300 trees on power lines left over 71,000 households and businesses in southern and central Baldwin County without power, representing 95% of the service area of a local electrical cooperative, Baldwin EMC. Only 5 of 22 substations remained in service the day after the storm. Two days after landfall, on September 18, Alabama governor Kay Ivey said in a news conference that 103,000 customers were still without power in Baldwin County, and another 60,000 in Mobile County. Five days after landfall, Baldwin EMC had restored power to close to 60,000 meters, representing 75% of their subscribers, but 18,197 meters remained without power. =Elsewhere= The remnants of Sally affecting the Carolinas The winds from the outer bands of Sally caused the south side of Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana to overflow its banks, flooding Lakeshore Drive. However, no serious damage was reported as the storm veered farther east than originally forecast. In Georgia, three tornadoes were confirmed and one person was killed and two others were injured after a large oak tree fell onto two homes and several cars in Atlanta. Tornadoes also occurred in Eastover, South Carolina and Rincon, where trees, homes, sheds, and power lines were damaged. Two other fatalities occurred in metro Atlanta, one in Cobb County where a man lost his life after a slick road caused a driver to lose control of his vehicle and hit the bus stop where the man was waiting at, and another in Gwinnett County where a 71-year-old woman was killed when a tree fell across the roadway, pinning her underneath. The remnants of Hurricane Sally affected Norway, sparking power outages. Aftermath The storm caused widespread power outages across Baldwin County and over 2,000 power lines were damaged or destroyed. Restoration of power is expected to take several weeks. The cities of Gulf Shores, Foley, Summerdale, and Robertsdale suffered the most extensive damage in Baldwin County. Due the large amount of damage in the city, a curfew was imposed in Mobile, Alabama, starting on September 16\\\\. Immediately after the storm, the Cajun Navy, a nonprofit rescue organization, began surveying damage in Alabama. The agricultural industry of Alabama, which was already under stress due to COVID- related impacts, suffered another devastating blow with many farmers' fields completely flooded, crops torn apart, and structures destroyed. Strong winds and heavy rainfall devastated crops, leaving many farmers across the state without hopes for a successful harvest. The Shoal River in Okaloosa county saw its highest level in 20 years as a result of all the rain that fell from Sally. This resulted in parts of Crestview, FL. being evacuated and bridges on I-10 and FL-85 being closed to all traffic.

As the nephew of , who was also a sculptor, he is identified by having sobrinho (Portuguese for nephew) placed after his name. Jos√© Sim√µes de Almeida (sobrinho) was born in Figueir√≥ dos Vinhos in the Leiria District of Portugal on June 17, 1880. In 1893, at the age of 13, he enrolled at the School of Fine Arts in Lisbon, now the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Lisbon. From 1897 he took the Sculpture course at the same school and was a student of his uncle, Jos√© Sim√µes de Almeida. After finishing the course, he obtained a scholarship to study in Paris, where he stayed between 1904 and 1907, receiving lessons from Raoul Verlet and Jean-Paul Laurens. He married Margarida Alc√¢ntara Sim√µes de Almeida who was also an artist. In 1915 he would become professor of sculpture at the School of Fine Arts. A statue in Cascais in memory of the dead in World War 1, by Sim√µes de Almeida Sim√µes de Almeida sculpted busts and monuments and other works of an official and commemorative character. One of his first works was a statue of Bento de G√≥is, for the explorer's home town of Vila Franca do Campo on S√£o Miguel Island in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores, which was inaugurated in 1906. Sim√µes de Almeida also offered a statue of Prince Henry the Navigator to S√£o Miguel in 1932, to commemorate the 5th centenary of the discovery of the Azores. Tympanum sculpted by Sim√µes de Almeida at the front of the Portuguese parliament For the S√£o Bento Palace, the Portuguese parliament, he executed the official bust of the Portuguese Republic in 1908. The original is now in the Museum of the President of the Republic but numerous reproductions have also been made. Other works at S√£o Bento Palace include allegories of the Constitution and Justice and the tympanum at the front of the building. He executed a bas-relief for the staircase of Lisbon City Hall, and the bas- reliefs of the monument to the Marquis of Pombal in Lisbon. He also sculpted busts, including one of the Portuguese statesman, Fontes Pereira de Melo. Several of his works are in the Chiado Museum in Lisbon. His work is also to be found outside Portugal, including in Brazil, Cuba and Mozambique. Following the overthrow of the Portuguese Monarchy in 1910, the First Portuguese Republic invited local artists to competitively submit designs for a new series of coins. From the many submissions received, one of Sim√µes de Almeida was chosen to go on the 1 Escudo silver coin as well as on a 10 Escudo coin. Sim√µes de Almeida died in Lisbon on 2 March 1950. Among the many awards he received, both during his life and posthumously, was being featured on a Portuguese postage stamp in 1971.

The village is about north-east of Moreton-in-Marsh. Lower Lemington lies east of the Fosse Way, and west of a small stream which may have been called the Leam and may have given its name to the place. There was a settlement here in Saxon times, and the place was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Lemingtune, when it was in the possession of Tewkesbury Abbey. The village continued to be known as Lemington until the 16th century. A distinction was then made between Lower Lemington and Upper Lemington: the two places were effectively a single village but with different manorial holdings and land ownership. Lower Lemington, held by Tewkesbury Abbey, was a separate manor and parish. Upper Lemington, about 300 metres to the east, was a manor held by Westminster Abbey and was included in the parish of Todenham. By the 20th century the name Upper Lemington had fallen out of use.

However, she miraculously recovered at the age of 67, attributing her recovery to the Virgin Mary. From then on, she dedicated her life to her faith in return for this miracle. She visited many shrines dedicated to Mary, such as the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes, Our Lady of Pontmain, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Sanctuary of F√°tima, Virgin of Larmes, Our Lady of Aparecida, Basilica della Santa Casa, and Camino de Santiago. From 1991 to 2015, she traveled more than 30,000 km on foot. On 27 December 2016, she traveled to the Basilica of Our Lady of Luj√°n. For this occasion, she traveled over 1200 km. In April and May 2018, she traveled 900 km in 40 days to reach Our Lady of Guadalupe. She dedicated this pilgrimage to families, one of her main focuses of prayer. In April 2015, Morosini met Pope Francis at St. Peter's Square. The Pope had personally invited her to the papal audience after touching the lives of many people following her trip to Argentina.

She is most known for her coming of age story Titanic Crossing, which became a best-seller and won a Mark Twain Readers Award in 1998.  Early life  Barbara Williams was born January 1, 1925, in Salt Lake City, Utah, daughter of Walter Wright. Williams began writing when she was five years old, when she was encouraged by her teachers to act as the classroom reporter for the children's page of a local newspaper, which she kept writing for until she became the editor for that same page at the seventh grade. She sold her first story, to the Salt Lake Tribune, when she was twelve years old. She graduated from East High School in 1942, and finished her course on the University of Utah in 1946, after which she married J. D. Williams. The couple moved to Washington D.C. on the same year, where Williams worked at the Library of Congress. Six years later, in 1952, they moved back to Salt Lake City, where her husband founded the Hinckley Institute of Politics. After moving back to her home town, she worked as a teacher in the University of Utah for twelve years.  Career as a writer  While in high school, Barbara met Emma Lou Thayne, with whom she would become friends. In 1952, the two created a group with six other promising writers from Salt Lake City, which remained active for 16 years. Williams also considered Thayne to be her \\"spiritual mentor\\". Williams had her first book published in 1965, Let's Go to an Indian Cliff Dwelling. Although she preferred writing fiction, most of her initial works are nonfiction. By 1983, she had already written almost thirty different works, with twelve of those being children's picture books. Her most successful work was Titanic Crossing, which sold over a million copies and, at the time, appeared as #3 on Publishers Weekly Fiction Bestsellers List.  Personal life and death  Williams had four children with her husband, J. D. Williams, who died in 2007. Barbara died in Salt Lake City, in 2013.  Selected works  Williams wrote a total of 52 books during her lifetime, which included nonfiction, picture books and young adult novels.

Biography Karpowicz was born in Krak√≥w to Anna Karpowicz-Westner (maiden name Wiejak) and S≈Çawomir Karpowicz(1952-2001), both painters. Her father was a professor of art at Cracow Academy of Fine Arts. Parents, together with their daughters Joanna and Katarzyna lived and painted in the studio on Pi≈Çsudzkiego Street previously owned by Olga Bozna≈Ñska. In 2005 she graduated from art high school Pa≈Ñstwowe Liceum Sztuk Plastycznych and began her studies at National School of Fine Arts in Cracow. Until 2008, she studied under Grzegorz Bednarski. She graduated with honors in 2010 under Leszek Misiak. Katarzyna Karpowicz‚Äôs works can be found in collections in Poland and abroad, as well as in the collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Gdansk. She lived and painted in Budapest (2013-2015) and later in England (2015-2016) in Pangbourne. She is a figurative painter. In 2019 she was awarded Anna Maria Siemie≈Ñska Grazella Foundation‚Äôs artistic scholarship for young artists. She gave several interviewsdiscussing her artistic heritage and musical taste. In an interview in Magyar Nemzet a Hungarian art critic talks about influences of Budapest on Karpowicz's art. Critical reception Between 2017-2019 she placed in top three of young Polish painters in a prestigious competition Young artist compass. Her art received positive comments from several independent art critics. Art critic Ma≈Çgorzata Czy≈Ñska mentions that her paintings combine childlike beauty and somewhat na√Øve trust, but are streaked with fear and the experience of the cruelty of fate. The same critic writes that Katarzyna Karpowicz‚Äôs works are deeply universal and existential, revolving around relationships, expectations, hope and fears. Samanta Belling indicates that Karpowicz's works prove that there are still young artists who live for art and are able to create an atmosphere that evokes past memories. She states that \\"Katarzyna Karpowicz seems to be out of this epoch, as if she were living beyond the time, just like her paintings. By deliberately simplifying the form of her work, she gives us room for impressions, guesses and personal interpretations.\\" Kama Wr√≥bel opines that each new series of Karpowicz's work has deep meaning and provides a point of departure for multi- faceted consideration of the human condition. Art historian Stanis≈Çaw Tabisz writes about Karpowicz's fascinations with the circus in Budapest, solar eclipse observed with her father in their hometown of Szczebrzeszyn and youthful influences in her paintings. He goes on to state that \\"Katarzyna Karpowicz's paintings express, in their sincere and straightforward message, the connection of each of us with the world, of experiencing everything in a unique and exceptional way.\\" Daniel Czepi≈Ñski writes that one finds oneself in Karpowicz's studio surrendered by magical trees, doors and openings which all lead to new worlds. Adam Szczuci≈Ñski finds captivating charm of the unknown in her paintings. He also writes in his essay A physician's viewpoint that Karpowicz's \\"powerful talent makes it truly impossible to remain indifferent to her small-sized images\\" and he concludes that \\"they infect the memory and stay like afterimages on the retina after we close our eyes.\\" Ewa Og≈Çoza in art journal artPaper writes that she is enchanted with Katarzyna Karpowicz's paintings and delighted with her life attitude and art \\"characterized by gratitude, kindness, humility, seriousness, mindfulness and tenderness towards the world, people and culture\\". She states that Karpowicz loves to paint and looks for consolation and hope in art \\"by designing her own fears, hopes, dreams, she gives comfort to others\\".

The sixteenth named storm, and sixth hurricane of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Paulette developed from a tropical wave on September 7\\\\. Due to relatively favorable conditions, Paulette gradually strengthened into a strong tropical storm, though an increase in wind shear caused it to weaken. Wind shear continued to increase to the south of the system, but despite the shear, Paulette unexpectedly strengthened back into a strong tropical storm on September 11, with deep convection located just north of the center. A dry air inclusion caused the cyclone's structure to become disheveled on September 12, though Paulette quickly recovered and strengthened into a hurricane at 03:00 UTC on September 13\\\\. Paulette then developed a closed eyewall and a clear eye as it steadily strengthened and moved towards Bermuda. Early on September 14th, Paulette made landfall in northeastern Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane while making a sharp turn to the north. It then further strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane as it moved away from the island, reaching its peak intensity on September 14 with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a pressure of 965 mbar (28.50 inHg). On the evening of September 15, it began to weaken and undergo extratropical transition, which it completed on September 16\\\\. Paulette's extratropical remnants persisted and moved southwards then eastwards, and eventually regenerated into a tropical storm early on September 22 south of the Azores. This proved to be short lived, however, as the storm quickly weakened and became post-tropical again only a day later. The remnants persisted for another week before dissipating south of the Azores on September 30. Paulette brought hurricane-force sustained winds and heavy rain to Bermuda, causing widespread power outages. Storm surge caused considerable damage to several waterfront properties. Large swells affected the U.S. mainland, and a 60-year-old man drowned off the coast of New Jersey after getting caught in the rough surf. No impacts were recorded from Paulette's second stint as a tropical cyclone. Paulette's damage totals were estimated to be in the millions. Meteorological history At 12:00 UTC on August 30, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to track a tropical wave located over Africa for possible development once it moved into the Tropical Atlantic. By 12:00 UTC on September 2, the wave emerged over water, where it began to slowly organize. The wave merged with two disturbances to its southwest between September 3-4 and September 5 respectively and formed a broad area of low pressure on September 6, but convective activity remained disorganized. Early the next morning, the low's shower and thunderstorm activity became more organized and better defined, and the NHC began issuing advisories for Tropical Depression Seventeen at 03:00 UTC on September 7\\\\. At the time of formation, the depression was located about 1,160 miles (1,865 km) west of the Cabo Verde Islands and about 1,425 miles (2,290 km) east of the Northern Leeward Islands. Before becoming a tropical depression, the storm had previously struggled to organize due to short-lasting convective bursts with little consistency. It continued to have an elongated center, but at 15:00 UTC on September 7, ASCAT data confirmed that the depression had strengthened, and the NHC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Paulette. This was the earliest 16th named Atlantic storm ever recorded, shattering the previous record set by 2005's Hurricane Philippe by 10 days. It moved generally west-northwestward over the warm Atlantic waters and gradually intensified despite the presence of southwesterly wind shear, which gave it a sheared appearance on satellite. At 15:00 UTC on September 8, Paulette reached its first peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) with a minimum central pressure of 995 mbars (29.39 inHg). It held this intensity for roughly 12 hours before increasing wind shear as a result of a large upper-level trough to the storm's northwest once again put a halt to intensification and weakened the storm. The storm's circulation soon became exposed later on September 9, although weakening remained slow. Paulette shortly before regeneration on September 21 Fluctuations in intensity became apparent as Paulette headed northwest and the storm's winds fell to 50 mph (80 km/h) later that day but very quickly raised back up to 65 mph (100 km/h) on September 10 despite Paulette being located in a region of at least 45 knots (50 mph) of wind shear, well above the proper values required for intensification of a typical tropical cyclone. As it exited this unfavorable environment it continued to intensify, nearing hurricane strength and displaying an eye-like feature on visible satellite imagery. A Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance aircraft flown into the storm later found Paulette had intensified to a hurricane on 21:00 UTC, September 12 on its approach to Bermuda. Although occasional dry air intrusions prevented quick intensification of Paulette, the hurricane slowly became more organized into September 13 as a ragged eye formed. Paulette later made landfall in Bermuda around 09:00 UTC, September 14 as a high-end Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph (145 km/h) and a pressure of 973 mb (28.74 inHg). Paulette continued to intensify after impacting Bermuda, becoming a Category 2 hurricane north of Bermuda and reaching its peak intensity at 18:00 UTC with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a pressure of 965 mbar (28.50 inHg) as it turned northeast. Paulette started to weaken 21 hours later as it began extratropical transition and the eyewall was eroded by dry air. It completed the transition at 15:00 UTC on September 16 and the NHC issued their final advisory. The powerful extratropical cyclone subsequently slowed down some and turned southward in the direction of the Azores, where the NHC began to monitor it again for possible redevelopment. Convective activity soon began to occur northeast of the circulation, although the circulation remained ill- defined. Thunderstorms began to wrap around the low by September 20, and on September 22 at 03:00 UTC the NHC determined Tropical Storm Paulette had re- formed about 300 miles (480 km) south-southeast of the Azores. Paulette continued eastward after its regeneration, obtaining a third peak intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a pressure of 1002 mb (29.59 inHg) six hours later, although by that time, its thunderstorms were already beginning to quickly wane. The storm briefly gained an eye-like feature surrounded by shallow convection before yet again becoming post-tropical at 03:00 UTC on September 23. Early on September 24, Paulette's remnant low curved westward, as the system reached the south side of the Azores High. Paulette's remnant low continued moving westward for the next few days before turning back eastward, as the system made a clockwise loop. Paulette passed south of the Azores again, before finally dissipating on September 30\\\\. Preparations and impact The wind swath of Hurricane Paulette with hurricane-force winds in red and tropical storm-force winds in orange. The approach of Paulette prompted the Bermuda government to issue a tropical storm watch at 03:00 UTC on September 12. This was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch at 09:00 UTC before a hurricane warning was issued at 15:00 UTC. Multiple observing stations in Bermuda started reporting tropical-storm-force wind gusts beginning at 23:00 UTC on September 13 with sustained tropical- storm-force winds coming soon after. Early on September 14, a wind gust of 117 mph (189 km/h) was measured at the Marine Operations Center (MAROPS), which is elevated at 290 ft above sea level. This came just over an hour after an island-wide power outage affected all of Bermuda, including the Bermuda Weather Service, with only cell phone service remaining active. This led to over 20,000 people losing electrical service. By September 17, 250 customers still remained without power on the island. There were no reported casualties or serious property damage in Bermuda but many trees and some power lines were downed across the island. In the United States, swells as high as 10 ft (3 m) affected the East Coast on September 15 and prompted the issuance of several high surf advisories around the coastline. Despite these warnings of high rip current risk by the National Weather Service, a 60-year-old man drowned while swimming in Lavallette, New Jersey after getting caught in rough surf produced by Hurricane Paulette.

He also secured and named the Union Hill post office, and served as its first postmaster for about ten years. In 1885, he was elected town supervisor and served in that position for the five years. In 1886, he sold his store and started a hardware store. In 1890, he moved to the village of Webster, where he purchased an extensive general store.

ASA's decision to begin boycotting Israel in December 2013 was controversial because it was the first major American scholarly organization to do so and it was heavily criticized. In April 2016, four ASA members aided by the pro- Israeli Brandeis Center sued ASA but the lawsuit was dismissed in 2019 when the judge ruled that plaintiffs lacked standing.  Decision to boycott Israel  In December 2013, members of the ASA voted to join the boycott of all Israeli educational institutions. The boycott was in response to the Palestinian-led BDS movement which since 2005 has called for comprehensive boycotts against Israel for alleged human rights violations against the Palestinians. The vote followed a similar one taken in April 2013 by the Association for Asian American Studies (AAAS) to boycott Israeli educational institutions. In a statement on the boycott, ASA's National Council encouraged members to vote in support of the boycott because of \\"Israel's violation of international law and UN resolutions; the documented impact of the Israeli occupation on Palestinian scholars and students; [and] the extent to which Israeli institutions of higher education are a party to state policies that violate human rights.\\" Some faculty, however, have objected that it is inappropriate for senior administrators to publicly position their college or university on an issue that faculty believe is one of academic freedom. After a ten-day online voting period, the resolution passed with 66.05 percent of voting members endorsing the boycott, 30.5 percent voting against it, and 3.43 percent abstaining. The boycott has since been joined by the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association, the African Literature Association, the Critical Ethnic Studies Association, and the National Women's Studies Association. Organizations that have voted against similar resolutions include the American Anthropological AssociationAnthropology Group Won't Boycott Israel by Elizabeth Redden, Inside Higher Ed, June 7, 2016. and the Modern Language Association.  Criticism  Israeli officials and the Anti- Defamation League reacted by stating that political and academic debates should not be mixed and accused the ASA of discrimination against Israel and \\"Orwellian antisemitism\\", a charge denied by supporters of the boycott such as George Bisharat,Applause for the academic boycott of Israel by George Bisharat, Chicago Tribune, January 30, 2014. David Lloyd and Colin Dayan. The Israeli ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, stated, \\"Rather than standing up for academic freedom and human rights by boycotting countries where professors are imprisoned for their views, the A.S.A. chooses as its first ever boycott to boycott Israel, the sole democracy in the Middle East, in which academics are free to say what they want, write what they want and research what they want.\\" UCLA professor Robin D. G. Kelley argued that such statements ‚Äúgrossly mischaracterized‚Äù the ASA resolution ‚Äúas an assault on academic freedom. On the contrary, it is one of the most significant affirmative acts any scholarly organization has proposed in defense of academic freedom since the anti- apartheid movement. Palestinian students and faculty living under occupation do not enjoy academic freedom, let alone the full range of basic human rights.‚Äù Senior administrators at over 200 universities have rejected the academic boycott of Israel and four universities have withdrawn from the organization: Brandeis University, Indiana University, Kenyon College, and Penn State Harrisburg. Prominent university and college presidents who have publicly condemned the boycott include Columbia University President Lee C. Bollinger, Princeton University President Christopher L.

The Association of American Universities, the American Association of University Professors, and the American Council on Education have all publicly denounced the boycott as a violation of the academic freedom of not only Israeli but also US scholars as well. The AMCHA Initiative maintains an updated list of universities that have terminated their ASA membership, and a list of universities that reject the boycott. Some politicians have expressed criticism through open letters and legislation. Democratic Congressman Eliot Engel sent a letter to the ASA's president in which he criticized \\"the unfair double standard Israel is regularly and unfairly subjected to by organizations such as yours.\\"Dozens of universities reject academic boycott of Israel (update) by Valerie Strauss, The Washington Post, December 23, 2013. In January 2014, 134 members of Congress (69 Democrats, 65 Republicans) signed a letter to ASA president Curtis Marez and president-elect Lisa Duggan, which accused the ASA of engaging in a \\"morally dishonest double standard.\\" The letter stated that: \\"Like all democracies, Israel is not perfect.

In January 2014, they put forward an anti-BDS law that would have banned universities and colleges from funding organizations that \\"have undertaken an official action boycotting certain countries or their higher education institutions.\\" But the proposed law faced sharp criticism over its implications on free speech and was discarded. Individual academics and commentators have sharply criticized the boycott through editorials and op- eds. George Mason University professor David Bernstein, described the ASA as having moved from, \\"the ordinary lunatic fringe\\" into \\"the racist lunatic fringe,\\" and Stanley N. Katz of Princeton University questioned the practical effect of the resolution, stating that the ASA \\"lacks any formal ties with Israeli institutions in the first place.\\" Canadian journalist Rex Murphy argued that the ASA \\"seeks to amputate all connection with thousands of other scholars.

In a January 2015 speech to Columbia Law School's Center for Law and Liberty, former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers said that in response to the ASA boycott, \\"universities should make clear that their names cannot be invoked as the purported sponsor for conferences or dialogues in which the primary thrust is demonization of Israel.... And it goes without saying that they should not allow themselves to be used as economic leverage against Israel.\\"Summers, Lawrence H. \\"Academic Freedom and Anti-Semitism.\\" Lawrence H. Summers. 29 January 2015. 4 February 2015. Eight past ASA presidents have signed a letter which described the boycott as \\"antithetical to the mission of free and open inquiry for which a scholarly organization stands.\\" The letter also criticized the fact that ‚ÄúASA Members were provided only the resolution and a link to a website supporting it. Despite explicit requests, the National Council refused to circulate or post to the ASA‚Äôs website alternative perspectives.\\"On the Eve of a Vote by Elizabeth Redden, Inside Higher Ed, December 12, 2013.  Response from the ASA  Curtis Marez, the president of the American Studies Association and an associate professor and chair of the ethnic-studies department at the University of California at San Diego has responded to critics of the boycott by arguing that the ASA is \\"targeting Israeli universities because they work closely with the government and military in developing weapons and other technology that are used to enforce the occupation and colonization of Palestinian land, while university-associated think tanks develop political and communications strategies to advance government aims and defend them internationally.\\" He has also predicted that \\"one day, after the tide turns, boycotts against Israel and the apartheid regime it has instituted will be viewed in the same way\\" as the Academic boycott of South Africa during the years of apartheid is now viewed, and that this comparison is especially apt just after the death of Nelson Mandela. Speaking to The New York Times, Marez argued that America has \\"a particular responsibility to answer the call for boycott because it is the largest supplier of military aid to the state of Israel.\\" Marez acknowledged that the United States has previously, and is currently, the largest supplier of military aid to many governments, including some with poor human rights records, but explained that Israel is the only country in which \\"civil society groups\\" had specifically asked the ASA to launch a boycott. Further responding to accusations that the ASA was singling out Israel while ignoring many other nations that have comparable or even worse human rights records that Israel (including many of Israel's neighbors), Marez replied: \\"One has to start somewhere.\\"Scholars‚Äô Group to Disclose Result of Vote on an Academic Boycott of Israel by Richard Perez-Pena, The New York Times (online edition), December 15, 2013. Marez has written on the organization's long-standing commitment to social justice, and the ASA's belief in nonviolent strategies as a tool to effect change. \\"The academic boycott of Israel,\\" writes Marez, \\"is grounded in the same anti-discrimination principles as other historical divestment and boycott strategies used to protest repressive state practices, including those employed against the South Africa apartheid regime and racial segregation in the United States.\\" Marez goes on to note that the United States Supreme Court holds these kinds of boycotts, ones which \\"aim to effect 'political, social, and economic change,\\" to be constitutionally protected speech activities. Additionally, some members of the ASA have linked their support of the boycott to their own studies. Angela Davis, a distinguished professor emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz, wrote that ‚Äú[t]he similarities between historical Jim Crow practices and contemporary regimes of segregation in Occupied Palestine make this resolution an ethical imperative for the ASA.‚Äù Professor Eric Cheyfitz of Cornell University, who is Jewish and has a daughter and three grandchildren who are Israeli citizens, wrote that ‚Äújust as the myth of American exceptionalism seeks to erase the genocide and ongoing settler colonialism of Indigenous peoples here in the United States so the myth of Israeli exceptionalism seeks to erase Israeli colonialism in Palestine and claim original rights to Palestinian lands.‚Äù  Lawsuit  In April 2016, four American studies professors, Simon J. Bronner, Michael Aaron Rockland, Michael Barton, and Charles Kupfer, sued ASA. They were aided by Kenneth L. Marcus of the pro-Israeli Brandeis Center, Eugene Kontorovich, a legal expert and vocal opponent of BDS, and Jerome Marcus of the Israeli think tank Kohelet Policy Forum. The named defendants were Lisa Duggan, Curtis Marez, Avery Gordon, Nerferti Tadiar, Sunaina Maira and Chandan Reddy. New defendants were added in 2018. Among them, Steven Salaita, who wasn't on the Board when the boycott decision was taken but had campaigned for the boycott. The plaintiffs alleged that the boycott violates Washington D.C. law, governing nonprofit corporations and that the adoption of the boycott violated the ASA's internal rules and procedures. The lawsuit alleged that the boycott fell outside the scope of the ASA's corporate charter and stated mission, a type of legal argument known as ultra vires. Kontorvich argued: \\"To be clear, this is not about silencing or stopping criticism of Israel, or in any way discouraging it. It is about non-profit corporations abiding by their own rules.\\" The lawsuit characterized the defendants as \\"insurgents\\" who through \\"concerted effort\\" had sought to convert ASA \\"into a political advocacy organization\\". The lawsuit was condemned by the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, which many of the individual defendants were members of: The lawsuit was dismissed in 2019 when the judge ruled that plaintiffs lacked standing because they could not demonstrate that their injuries exceeded $75,000 which would have been required for federal litigation. Pro-Palestinian media heralded it as a victory, but the plaintiffs' lawyers vowed to continue the fight. However, in June 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit unanimously upheld the district court's ruling which put a definite end to the case. The judges also noted that the plaintiffs hadn't tried to explain how the ASA boycott had injured them: \\"The Professors nowhere explain how they have suffered economic or reputational damage. They assert no loss of standing within their universities. They do not purport to have been denied tenure, promotions or other prestigious honors. Nor do they claim to have had their writings rejected by academic journals.\\" Two related cases brought forward by David Abrams of the Zionist Advocacy Center in the state of New York had previously been dismissed for \\"[demonstrating] neither injury nor standing to sue.\\" In both cases, Abrams alleged injury over ASA's refusal to let Israeli organizations become members. But in the first case Abrams' International Legal Forum didn't actually attempt to join ASA and in the second case his organization, Athenaeum Blue & White, incorporated on the same day he filed the lawsuit, successfully became a member.

It is located on the south side of the Qarawiyyin Mosque, close to the Bou Khareb River which runs through the heart of the medina. The square dates back to the Middle Ages but has also undergone renovations in modern times. It is adjoined by the Qarawiyyin's library to the northwest, by the Saffarin Madrasa to the east, and by the Saffarin Hammam (bathhouse) to the southwest. It is named after the coppersmiths (seffarin or saffarin; ) who have had their workshops here for centuries.  History  The square was historically the main souq (market) of the city's coppersmiths (), who gave the square its name. They are still present today. Their workshops have been established here since at least the 16th century, when Leo Africanus noted their presence. The Saffarin Madrasa, whose entrance is on this square, was built here in 1271 CE by the Marinid sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub and is the oldest purpose-built madrasa in Morocco. It is still in use today and was most recently renovated in the late 2010s. The Qarawiyyin library on the northwest side of the square was first built here in the late 16th century by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, although the Qarawiyyin had an earlier library built further north in 1349 by Abu Inan. The Saffarin Hammam also dates to the 14th century during the Marinid era. The square underwent a significant set of renovations in the 1930s and 1940s during the French protectorate period due to a request by the manager of the habous (endowments) of the Qarawiyyin, as well as on the initiatives of King Mohammed V. This program of restorations, which affected many of the surrounding buildings and boutiques, has given the square much of its present-day appearance. In the process, the library of the Qarawiyyin was significantly expanded and was reopened in 1949 in its current form seen today. The Madrasa Mohammadia, an annex to the Saffarin Madrasa added in the 18th century, was also significantly renovated and expanded at this time. More recently, in the 2010s, several of the surrounding structures were again renovated, including the two madrasas (Saffarin and Mohammadia) and the Qarawiyyin library. The Saffarin Hammam was also recently undergoing restoration, under the supervision of architect Rachid Halaoui, as part of an Austrian-led project to restore various historic hammams across the Mediterranean region.

He is mostly known for his projects in his native New York City, particularly relating to parks. He also worked in Chicago and Cleveland.  Early life and education  Robert Charles Weinberg was born in New York City in 1902. Weinberg attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School. He earned a B.A. degree from the Harvard School of Architecture in 1926 and another degree (noted as a second B.A. or a graduate degree in different sources) from the Harvard School of City Planning in 1931.  Career  Weinberg was hired by the newly formed New York City Parks Department in 1934. Previously, each of the city's five boroughs had its own independent parks department. These were consolidated in 1934, with Robert Moses serving as the commissioner. Weinberg and Moses often disagreed on their philosophies of designing parks. Weinberg believed that parks should be customized to the neighborhood, while Moses preferred a more uniform design for all parks. From the late 1930s through the early 1950s, Weinberg was part of the coalition opposing a number of renovation plans for Washington Square Park that were supported by Moses. These efforts culminated in the park being closed to vehicles in 1958. In 1939, Weinberg joined the New York Department of City Planning. Robert Moses was responsible for Weinberg's departure from the department in 1941. From 1966 to 1971, he was a commentator and architecture critic at WNYC radio, where he discussed a variety of topics related to city planning during twice- weekly talks. Although mainly known for his work in New York, he also did work for the Chicago Housing Authority and the Cleveland Planning Commission. He was known for designing the Vinmont Houses in the Riverdale area of The Bronx. He had plans to build 340 low-income housing units on another nearby plot of land he owned in Riverdale. That project failed to get approval, and the plot was eventually sold to the USSR to build a residential compound for diplomats and their families.  Preservationist activities  Weinberg was instrumental in preserving the Jefferson Market Courthouse building in the 1960s. Built in 1876, it was vacant by 1950 and slated to be demolished. A preservation drive by local residents led to the formation of The Committee for a Library in the Courthouse, with Weinberg convincing the New York Public Library to adopt the building. It is now the Jefferson Market Library.; ; Weinberg was also a member of the Action Group for Better Architecture in New York (AGBANY) in the early 1960s. The group was most known for working to preserve the original Pennsylvania Station building designed by McKim, Mead & White. The effort was unsuccessful and the building was demolished in 1963.  Academic, civic, and professional affiliations  Weinberg was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and chair of the institute's Joint Committee on Design Control. He served as the book review editor for the Journal of the American Institute of Planners from 1947 to 1959 and was the chair of their New York Regional Chapter. Weinberg was an adjunct professor at New York University, where he created a program in City Planning. He also taught at the Pratt Institute, the New School for Social Research, and at Yale. He was a member of the Municipal Art Society, using his position there to advocate for landmarks preservation via the Bard Act.  Vinmont  The name Weinberg is German for \\"Wine Mountain\\", which translates to \\"Vinmont\\" in French. The Vinmont section of Riverdale, Vinmont Road, Vinmont Houses, and Vinmont Veteran Park all trace their names to Weinberg in this way.  Personal life  Weinberg died in 1974.

He currently plays college football for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, where he serves as the team's starting quarterback.  Early years  Sims played high school football for Sandalwood High School in Jacksonville, Florida from 2016 to 2020. He served as the team's starting quarterback starting in his sophomore year. While initially hoping to play college football for the Miami Hurricanes, the team showed no interest in him, and he instead was drawn towards the Florida State Seminoles under then-head coach Willie Taggart. In February 2019, he committed to Florida State, with the prospect of being a backup quarterback to James Blackman. Later that year, he competed in the Elite 11 quarterback competition. On December 11, following Florida State's firing of Taggart and hiring of Mike Norvell as new head coach, he rescinded his commitment to Florida State, and on December 18, he signed to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Ultimately, Sims had received over a dozen offers from schools in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, including Florida State, Georgia Tech, and the Maryland Terrapins. 247Sports.com ranked him the No. 10 dual- threat quarterback in the country and the No. 223 recruit overall. In January 2020, he played in the Under Armour All-America Game, a high school football all-star game, where he was part of the winning team.

Graham and Sims were considered the strongest candidates for the position, though the team refused to comment prior to the start of the season. On September 11, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution announced that Sims would be the team's starting quarterback. He made his collegiate start on September 12, leading the Yellow Jackets to a 16‚Äì13 upset victory against the Florida State Seminoles at Doak Campbell Stadium. Sims completed 24 of 35 passes for 277 passing yards and accumulated 64 rushing yards. With the game, Sims became the first true freshman quarterback to play in a season opener for the Yellow Jackets since Reggie Ball in 2003 and the first to win a season opener. For his performance, Sims was named Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) rookie of the week and 247Sports.com's true freshman of the week, and was recognized in weekly lists put out by the Davey O'Brien Award and the Manning Award. Following this debut, the Yellow Jackets suffered two defeats, losing 49‚Äì21 to the UCF Knights and 37‚Äì20 to the Syracuse Orange. In the latter game, Sims threw four interceptions.

Early life and career  Teodoro Antill√≠ was born in San Pedro, Buenos Aires, on July 27, 1883. In his youth, he worked at the city's civil registry. As a teenager, he clerked for the local police and left the job at age 21 after becoming involved in anarchism. He moved to Buenos Aires and wrote for magazines such as Fray Mocho and Mundo Argentino, and wrote for the libertarian press. When writing for Germinal in 1906, he met Rodolfo Gonz√°lez Pacheco, who became a lifelong friend. The pair edited La Campana Nueva the next year. Their anarchist daily La Batalla was short-lived, starting and ending in 1910 with the Argentina Centennial's suppression of anarchism, as the pair were arrested and imprisoned in Ushuaia. Upon their release, Antill√≠ and Pacheco founded the newspaper Alberdi and, in 1911, the short-lived journal El Manifiesto. While Pacheco was out of the country, Antill√≠ joined the staff of La Protesta and spent three additional years in prison for an article defending Sim√≥n Radowitzky. He left La Protesta in 1916 and, with Pacheco back in the country, they unsuccessfully attempted to create La Protesta Humana. Instead they created La Obra, which was originally influenced by the 1917 Russian Revolution but eventually moved away from Bolshevism and refused an \\"anarcho-Bolshevik\\" offer to launch a journal together. La Obra was suppressed and shuttered during the January 1919 Tragic Week. Their next anarchist daily, Tribuna Proletaria, was overrun by the anarcho-Bolsheviks by its end in March 1919. Antill√≠ and Pacheco founded El Libertario in 1920 and the anarchist weekly La Antorcha in 1921. The latter veered towards insurrectionary anarchism and Antill√≠ was among its most prolific writers. Suffering from illness, Antill√≠ returned to his hometown in 1923 where he died on August 8th. He was buried beneath an eucalyptus tree. His unpublished articles continued to be printed in La Antorcha after his death. In 1924, Pacheco published his articles from the weekly magazine into a posthumous book, ¬°Salud a la Anarqu√≠a!

The first work that Cioran published, it is a series of short essays, dealing with themes that would later permeate his work, such as death, insomnia and insanity. On The Heights of Despair received the King Carol II Royal Foundation's Young Writer's Prize. This was the only award that Cioran himself accepted - his later works would win the awards for the Prix Rogier Namier and Grand prix de litt√©rature Paul-Morand, but he refused both of them.  Content  On the Heights of Despair is composed of essays, most of which are about two pages in length, in which Cioran gives his thoughts on a variety of societal phenomena, including, but not limited to, suicide, depression, pain, and social isolation. The title comes from a phrase used in Romanian newspapers which report suicides by saying that the person chose to kill themselves while \\"on the heights of despair.\\" At this stage in his life, Cioran was a supporter of national socialism, and he had expressed his support for the Night of the Long Knives,Cioran, 1934, in Ornea, p.192 which occurred in the same year On The Heights of Despair was published. However,On the Heights of Despair displays an absurdist and post-modernist attitude, which runs counter to national socialist philosophy. On the Heights of Despair was written in a bout of depression and insomnia, conditions which Cioran was a lifelong victim of: \\"I‚Äôve never been able to write otherwise than in the midst of the depression brought about by my nights of insomnia. For seven years I could barely sleep. I need this depression, and even today before I sit down to write I play a disk of Gypsy music from Hungary.\\"  Reception  In a manner that Cioran would later become recognised for, On the Heights of Despair was noted for its elaborate prose, aphorisms and philosophical pessimism. On the Heights of Despair was notable for being Cioran's first work, and though in his later years he gained a following among French intellectuals, the response in his home country of Romania was considerably different. The blasphemous nature of Cioran's work forced his parents - his father, a priest, and mother, head of the Christian Women's League, to maintain a low profile. His mother once said that if she knew how miserable he would have turned out, she would have aborted him, a statement which Cioran described as \\"liberating.\\" Despite this fact, she still read his works, whereas his father refused, because of his profession: \\"Everything that I wrote bothered him and he didn't know how to react. But my mother understood me.\\" Cioran's works were banned under the rule of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. Speaking about On the Heights of Despair, Saint-John Perse described Cioran as \\"the greatest French writer to honour our language since the death of Paul Val√©ry.\\" See also *Emil Cioran *Peter Wessel Zapffe *The Conspiracy Against the Human Race  References  Category:1934 books Category:Philosophy books Category:Romanian books Category:Works about antinatalism Category:Works about philosophical pessimism Category:Works by Emil Cioran ","title":"On the Heights of Despair"},{"id":"65299368","text":"The Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) is a federally funded biomedical research facility affiliated with the Texas Biomedical Research Institute. The SNPRC became the seventh National Primate Research Center in 1999. Research The SNPRC has two scientific units: \\"Infectious Diseases Immunology & Control\\" and \\"Comparative Medicine & Health Outcomes\\". The SNPRC also has a Laboratory Core Services Division, which consists of three laboratories: immunology, research imaging, and pathology. Primates in captivity The center houses over 2,500 non-human primates. Among the primates held in captivity at the SNPRC are baboons, chimpanzees, common marmosets, and rhesus macaques. The center houses over 1,000 baboons, which makes it the world's largest colony of baboons used for biomedical research. Furthermore, the center sells primates from their colonies to other researchers. Incidents and controversies =2014= In 2014, a male baboon was injured in its cage and died after its injuries were uncared for. The injuries went unreported and the baboon went uncared for several days after. As a result, the baboon was emaciated, developed scabs and a large abscess on its leg, and also contracted blood poisoning from which he died. In 2014, a macaque was placed in a new group of other macaques, and sustained several severe injuries during the following year including a tail degloving injury and multiple lacerations to the face and body. A veterinarian recommended that the group be assessed by the facility behavior team, but no assessment was ever conducted. In 2014, the USDA cited the SNPRC for inaccuracies on their 2013 annual report. More specifically, the SNPRC did not accurately report the number of animals which had pain or distress that did not have anesthetic, analgesics or tranquilizing drugs administered. In 2014, a juvenile baboon was killed when a guillotine door fell on the animal. =2015= In 2015, a USDA inspection found that one research protocol contained incomplete descriptions of methods for hand rearing and euthanizing neonatal animals. In 2015, the USDA cited the SNPRC for three instances of negligence. The first instance involved the center having a supply of numerous outdated drugs and medical supplies. The second instance involved several bags of food enrichment items being left open, which may have allowed contamination and/or deterioration of the food. The third instance involved a large amount of cockroaches living in a primate housing area. In 2015, there were two incidents in which baboons were injured or killed, which were due to errors made by employees at the SNPRC. In one incident, a female baboon was injured after three male baboons gained access to here chute system. In the second incident, a male baboon gained access to a chute containing a female and her infant, attacked the two, and killed the infant. =2016= In 2016, a USDA inspection revealed several instances of negligence and breaches of protocol at the SNPRC. In one instance, researchers had failed to use the approved scoring sheet and euthanasia criteria for a particular study. In another instance, the center had used 45 more animals in two studies than they had been approved for. In yet another instance, the USDA found that the SNPRC's 2015 annual report was missing information regarding the standards and regulations for the sanitation of primate enclosures and the feeding of primates. In another instance, it was revealed that animals in some studies may have experienced unrelieved pain or distress prior to euthanasia. =2017= In 2017, a baboon received second- degree burns from an exposed heating pipe in its cage. In 2017, a USDA inspection report revealed deteriorating and unmaintained conditions in some of the primate cages. More specifically, some surfaces were deteriorating and paint was eroding from one of the walls. In 2017, two macaques sustained injuries after they opened a divider between their enclosures and comingled. This incident was the fault of a caretaker who failed to secure the latch on the divider. =2018= In April 2018, four baboons escaped from the SNPRC but were later recaptured. =2019= In 2019, a macaque sustained an injury to her finger after sticking it in a hole in her enclosure. As a result, the macaque's finger had to be amputated. Staff at the SNPRC were aware of the risk of the hole in the enclosure, but did not take protections against it on that day. In 2019, a marmoset was severely injured and then euthanized after another marmoset gained access to its cage. In 2019, a USDA inspection report revealed several instances of unclean and deteriorating conditions at the center. For example, the report described dirty light fixtures, peeling paint, damaged dry wall, and damaged edge of a counter.

In late 1864, Major General Sterling Price of the Confederate States Army began a raid into Missouri in hopes of diverting Union troops away from more important theaters of the American Civil War. After a defeat at the Battle of Westport on October 23, Price's Army of Missouri began retreating through Kansas, but suffered three consecutive defeats on October 25. By October 28, the retreating Confederates had reached Newtonia, where the Second Battle of Newtonia broke out when Union pursuers caught up with the Confederates. Confederate cavalry under Brigadier General Joseph O. Shelby was initially successful, but after Union reinforcements under Brigadier General John B. Sanborn counterattacked, the Confederates withdrew. The Union troops did not pursue, and Price's men escaped, eventually reaching Texas by December. In 2004, the site of the battle was listed on the NRHP. The site consists of four contributing properties: the battlefield proper, a cornfield near the Mathew H. Ritchey House, a Union artillery position north of the main battlefield site, and a portion of the Granby Road. Most of the battlefield is located within the site, although some outlying portions are not well preserved and are not included. Several noncontributing properties are located within the site, including a bakery and a silo. While railroad construction, open-pit mining, and the development of Stark City have encroached on the site, it is considered to be well-preserved. A 2013 study determined that the battlefield was not significant enough for National Park Service management. History =Context= Map of Price's Raid By the beginning of September 1864, the American Civil War had been continuing for several years, and events in the eastern United States, especially the Confederate defeat in the Atlanta campaign, gave President of the United States Abraham Lincoln, who supported continuing the war, an edge in the 1864 United States Presidential Election over George B. McClellan, who promoted ending the war. At this point, the Confederacy had very little chance of winning the war. As events east of the Mississippi River turned against the Confederates, General Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department, was ordered to transfer the infantry under his command to the fighting in the Eastern and Western Theaters. However, this proved to be impossible, as the Union Navy controlled the Mississippi River, preventing a large scale crossing. Despite having limited resources for an offensive, Smith decided that an attack designed to divert Union troops from the principal theaters of combat would have the same effect as the proposed transfer of troops. Major General Sterling Price and the Confederate Governor of Missouri Thomas Caute Reynolds suggested that an invasion into the state of Missouri would be an effective offensive; Smith approved the plan and appointed Price to command the offensive. Price expected that the offensive would create a popular uprising against Union control of Missouri, divert Union troops away from principal theaters of combat (many of the Union troops previously defending Missouri had been transferred out of the state, leaving the Missouri State Militia to be the state's primary defensive force), and aid McClellan's chance of defeating Lincoln; on September 19, Price's column entered the state. Originally, Price and his Army of Missouri had hoped to capture St. Louis, but a defeat at the Battle of Pilot Knob in late September dissuaded the Confederates from assaulting that city. Jefferson City, a secondary target, was deemed to strong to attack in early October, so the Confederates began moving westwards towards Kansas City. During the movement, the Army of Missouri collected supplies during side raids such as the Battle of Glasgow, although Major General William S. Rosecrans, commander of the Union Department of the Missouri, began mobilizing troops against Price. By October 23, Union Major General Samuel R. Curtis and the Army of the Border caught up with Price near Kansas City and badly defeated him in the Battle of Westport. The Army of Missouri then began retreating through Kansas, but was forced to fight three battlesMarais des Cygnes, Mine Creek, and Marmiton River. Mine Creek in particular was a disastrous rout in which large quantities of supplies and soldiers were captured. On October 28, Price halted his retreat near Newtonia, Missouri, hoping to give his weary men a rest. =Second Battle of Newtonia= Price's main camp was south of Newtonia, although a small skirmish line was aligned to the west of the town. Major General James G. Blunt's command approached around 14:00, and opened fire with artillery. The Confederates were caught by surprise, but Brigadier General Joseph O. Shelby deployed his cavalrymen dismounted to meet Blunt's threat. Both sides then formed into lines of battle, and began an artillery duel. Blunt had four 3-inch ordnance rifles and two mountain howitzers, while Shelby had two 10-pounder Parrott rifles. Shelby soon ordered a counterattack. While fire from the mountain howitzers allowed the Union right to hold, part of the Confederate line outflanked Blunt's left. The Union soldiers fell back to a line near the Mathew H. Ritchey farm and reformed. One of the Union batteries was repositioned to a supporting role northwest of the town; meanwhile, Shelby's men reorganized and prepared for another attack. With his ammunition running low, Blunt was considering ordering a withdrawal from the field when he was reinforced by the command of Brigadier General John B. Sanborn. Sanborn aligned his brigade to the left of Blunt's line, and after waiting for his cavalrymen to dismount, ordered an assault. Encouraged by the advance of Sanborn's brigade, Blunt's men joined in the fight. Additional Union artillery had arrived with Sanborn, increasing the Confederates' artillery disadvantage to two guns against eight. Facing a freshly reinforced and suddenly aggressive foe, Shelby ordered a withdrawal. A small detachment from Major General James F. Fagan's division arrived during the retreat to support Shelby, but by then, the battle was already lost. The Confederates withdrew to some woods south of Newtonia, but were not pursued. Curtis, who had arrived on the field, and Blunt decided not to pursue until the next morning, due to the fatigue of their men. Both Blunt and Shelby claimed victory. Estimates of casualties incurred during the fighting vary significantly: one modern source places Union casualties at 26 and those of the Confederates at 24, while a period newspaper reported 113 Union casualties and \\"less than 200\\" for the Confederates. Price continued his retreat after Newtonia, reaching Arkansas by October 30. Curtis continued pursuing the Confederates until Price reached the Arkansas River on November 8. The Army of Missouri did not stop its retreat until it reached Texas; by December, less than a third of the men Price had taken into Missouri remained in his army. Features Map of the Second Battle of Newtonia battle area The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on December 23, 2004 as the Second Battle of Newtonia Site, with a NRHP register number of 4000698. While the town of Stark City has been developed since the battle was fought, land use patterns at the site are still primarily agricultural. The site of the battlefield itself suffered disruption when the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad was constructed in the early 20th century. Tailings from open-pit mining also intrude on the site, but are not particularly noticeable from the ground. While the roads used at the time of the battle are no longer in use and some small stone walls present in 1864 have disappeared, the site's NRHP application form noted that landscape appearance was similar to what it was during the battlefield. A road runs through the southern portion of the site, but it also provides a vantage point for open views of the field. Four contributing properties make up the district. The first is defined as the overall battlefield. Most of the primary fighting area of the battle is included in this property, which encompasses , the majority of which is in private hands. Some isolated fringes of the fighting occurred south of the modern-day location of Stark City, although the ground there is not well preserved and is not part of the NRHP site. The second district is the Ritchey cornfield. While Ritchey farmed of corn in 1864, only are part of the historic site. The cornfield site is located at the intersection of Missouri Route 86 and Missouri Supplemental Route O and is still used for agricultural purposes. North of Route 86 and the main battle site is a contributing property preserving the Union artillery position on the ridge. The final contributing property is the former site of the Granby Road near the artillery site; while the road no longer exists, its track has been identified through archaeology and the presence of a hedgerow. In addition to the contributing properties; a bakery, a machine shop, a silo, and 17 houses and outbuildings are located within the site, mainly on its edges. The site's boundaries include most of the core area of the battlefield. While the Second Battle of Newtonia Site is distinct from the First Battle of Newtonia Historic District, the two NRHP properties' boundaries touch at two points. The American Battlefield Trust has preserved at Newtonia, and additional land is preserved by the Newtonia Battlefields Association. After the site was listed on the NRHP, the National Park Service (NPS) conducted an analysis to determine if the location was suitable for inclusion in the NPS's list of official units, but the study determined that while the site was well- preserved, it did not rise to the level of importance that would warrant NPS preservation as a site characteristic of either the American Civil War as a whole, Price's Raid, or through association with Price, which the study noted as an important historical figure.

Mount Pennell is the second- highest mountain in the Henry Mountains, following Mount Ellen, 10.6 miles to the north. It is situated in a dry, rugged, and sparsely settled region east of Capitol Reef National Park, on primitive land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Several deep canyons cut the sides of the mountain, which on the higher slopes supports oak, Ponderosa pine, subalpine fir, spruce, Douglas fir, and aspen.https://www.blm.gov/visit/mt-pennell Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the nearby Colorado River. History This mountain was first called Un-chu'-ka-ret by the native Paiute.Don D. Fowler and Catherine S. Fowler, Anthropology of the Numa, Smithsonian Institution Press, 1971, page 141. Almon Harris Thompson served as chief topographer and geographer of John Wesley Powell's Second Geographical Expedition (1871‚Äì1875) when he named Mount Ellen after his wife, Ellen Powell Thompson, and Mount Pennell was later named for his friend Joseph Pennell (1857‚Äì1926), an American artist and author.Don D. Fowler and Catherine S. Fowler, Anthropology of the Numa, Smithsonian Institution Press, 1971, page 141.Pete Klocki and Tiffany Mapel, A Wild Redhead Tamed: A Brief History of the Colorado River and Lake Powell, 2009, page 85. Thompson also named Mount Hillers, seven miles to the southeast.https://gotbooks.miracosta.edu/gonp/3Dcanyons/html/escalante.htm Through his work on the Powell expedition, and later as a geographer at the U.S. Geological Survey, Thompson was responsible for naming many geographical features in the Western United States. The American geologist Grove Karl Gilbert surveyed this area in 1875 and 1876, and published his findings in 1879 as a monograph, The Geology of the Henry Mountains. The term laccolith was first applied as laccolite by Gilbert after his study of intrusions of diorite in the Henry Mountains. Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Mount Pennell. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, it is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C), and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.

Liston was born in Secunderabad where his father was an Army Chaplain. The surgeon Robert Liston, known for Liston's Splint, was a cousin of his father. Liston was sent to be educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh followed by studies at the Albany Academy, Glasgow before joining Glasgow University to study medicine. A year after graduating he joined the Indian Medical Service in 1898. He was trained at the Army Medical School at Netley. His was posted to Secunderabad and shortly on arrival he was involved in research surrounding a plague outbreak at Bombay. A commission was sent from England that included T. R. Fraser from Edinburgh, Almroth Wright from Netley and M. A. Ruffer from Egypt. Liston was chosen to assist Wright and they established a laboratory in Bombay and began work. In 1901 the commission produced a report in five volumes. He also worked simultaneously on malaria and produced a monograph of the Indian Anopheles species along with S.P. James with illustrations by D.A. Turkhud. Liston was then recalled to England to work at Netley under Wright. He began to examine the suggestions that fleas were key in the spread of plague. In 1902 Liston received his MD and a Bellahouston gold medal from Glasgow for his studies on malaria. He returned to India in 1903 and was posted in Bombay to worked under W.B. Bannerman and Waldemar Haffkine. The main investigations were on rat fleas but they were unable to demonstrate transmission of the plague through their bites. After examining guinea pigs that died from plague at the Bombay zoo, he decided that they could be used to trap fleas in homes. This experiment proved valuable and they were able to confirm transmission by the Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis). He was then involved in development of a plague vaccine. He retired and settled in Edinburgh and continued to work as a bacteriologist at the Royal College of Physicians‚Äô Laboratory.

From a presentation miniature within a historiated initial in the only manuscript copy. Fidentius of Padua () was a Franciscan administrator and writer active in the Holy Land between 1266 and 1291. He wrote a unique tract on the Christian recovery and retention of the Holy Land. Biography Fidentius may have been a native of Padua or its region, or else was attached to a convent there. He was born before 1226. In June 1266, he was made vicar provincial of the Holy Land, an office restricted by the Franciscan rule to those at least forty years old. That same year, acting on the request of the Templar grand master Thomas B√©rard, he sent two friars to the besieged castle of Safad to serve as chaplains. In 1268, Fidentius was in Tripoli when he received a copy of the Liber Clementis from a Syrian Christian. On learning of the fall of Antioch (18 May 1268), he left Tripoli to visit the Christians captured by Sultan Baybars I to provide for their spiritual needs. He shadowed Baybars' army on horseback for several days, possibly also acting as an ambassador of the Crusader states. The firmans issued by Baybars favouring the Franciscans may be the product of his work. By 1274, he was back in Europe. He attended the Second Council of Lyon and at the first session on 7 May was commissioned by Pope Gregory X to write a report on recovering lost territory in the Holy Land. It is probable that he had met the future pope on his mission to the Holy Land in 1271. Fidentius appears to have visited the convent of Saint Anthony in Padua in 1283. He was back in the Holy Land again in 1289, when he visited the prisoners-of-war after the fall of Tripoli on 26 April. It was only in 1290 or 1291, shortly before the fall of Acre, that he delivered his report, Liber recuperationis Terre Sancte, to Pope Nicholas IV. The report was probably written in the Holy Land, mainly in Acre. He was still there in February 1290, since he refers to the invasion of Cilician Armenia that took place that month in his Liber. A Fidentius who undertook some missions in Italy is mentioned in the records of the convent of Saint Anthony in Padua in 1294, although it may have been a different person. The Blessed Fidentius mentioned in some sources must be a different person, since he was clearly dead before 1249. The Franciscan vicar must have died after 1291, probably in Padua. Liber recuperationis Terre Sancte The Liber recuperationis Terre Sancte‚Äîor On the Recovery of the Holy Land‚Äîsurvives in a single parchment manuscript of the 14th century, now in Paris, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Lat. 7242, at folios 85r‚Äì126r. It is written in Latin. It begins with a dedication to Nicholas IV. A schematic map of the Mediterranean appears on folio 122v.An image of the map follows p. 88 in . The text has been edited by Girolamo Golubovich. It is one of the earliest examples of the De recuperatione genre. The military focus of Fidentius' plan contrasts with the missionary ideal more typical of the Franciscans. This may explain in part why his work appears to have had little influence. His lack of zeal for martyrdom also contrasts with that of many Franciscans working in the Holy Land in the late 13th century. Unlike more influential plans for the recovery of the Holy Land, such as those of Ramon Llull and Pierre Dubois, the Liber recuperationis is the only one based on firsthand experience of the land and interactions with its inhabitants, both Christian and Muslim. Marino Sanudo probably had Fidentius' text before him when he wrote his own Liber secretorum fidelium crucis. =History and geography= The Liber is divided into 94 chapters in seven chronologically- arranged sections that clearly divide into two functional parts. The first six sections are the first part and cover the history of the Holy Land under the Gentiles, Jews, Assyrians, Romans, Greeks and Saracens. The last two are more fully developed than the first four. The Greek section is devoted largely to the question of how the Christians lost the Holy Land. The blame falls primarily on moral decline. There follows an explanation for why the Christians should rightly repossess them. The Saracen section is devoted to the life of Mu·∏•ammad, for which he depends on the writings of Peter the Venerable. His account is mostly legendary, and he is apparently unfamiliar with Islamic tradition. He draws on John of Damascus, Jacques de Vitry and possibly Mark of Toledo and Petrus Alphonsi. His history of Islam bears a resemblance to William of Tripoli's De statu sarracenorum, which was drawn up for the occasion of the Second Council of Lyon. He records that Mu·∏•ammad effectively created the Islamic religion out of what he learned from a Nestorian Christian monk named Sergius and three Jews of Mecca. He did know Arabic, and quotes from the Qur æƒÅn to describe the seven vices he attributes to Muslims: infidelity, lewdness, cruelty, greed, overconfidence, foolishness and volatility. He also backs up his account with personal experiences. The seventh section, on the rule of the Crusaders, forms the second part of the Liber and is devoted to the history of the Crusades and the recovery and permanent defence of Christian rule. His history is designed to provide exempla (examples) to be imitated or avoided by future Crusaders. He describes seven routes from western Europe to the Holy Land, pointing out the location of enemy fortresses, the potential allies along the way and the logistical difficulties unique to each. His basic prescription is for a joint land and naval campaign. An army would move overland following the same route as the First Crusaders, joining up with the Cilician Armenians, Georgians and Mongols, while a fleet would be operating out of some eastern Mediterranean port. Fidentius includes some chapters on the topography of the Holy Land, especially of its cities, which would be important for planning the defence and maintenance of the conquests. He stresses the importance of understanding the Muslim way of war and the climate of the Holy Land prior to any expedition. =Military strategy= The maintenance of the conquests is of great concern to him. He suggests that each bishopric, abbey and city in the West should send one to three or more knights to serve in the East. He also specifies the need for infantry (specifically, spearmen and archers) and shield bearers to protect them from enemy archers. It was important that cavalry and infantry operate together. He lays great stress on the importance of archery, the weakness of Muslim infantry and the necessity of combined arms. His tactical and strategic ideas are taken largely from Vegetius' De re militari, but he offers accounts of Egyptian Maml≈´k tactics so Crusaders could better counter them. In particular, he warns about the feigned retreat. Control of the seas would be required for recovery of the Holy Land. For this Fidentius envisions a permanent fleet of ten galleys and a wartime fleet of forty to fifty (at a bare minimum thirty). These were to be based in Acre, Cyprus, Ruad and Rhodes. This fleet would enforce a blockade on trade between \\"evil\\" Christians and the Maml≈´ks. Fidentius sees this trade as helping the sultan of Egypt in two ways: from Europe he obtains war materiel (iron, tin, timber, oil) and from Asia he obtains dues on goods brought to Egypt via the Red Sea for trade to Europe. If the spice trade were deflected from the Red Sea to Mongol Persia, Egypt would be deprived of customs duties and would also lose export markets because of the reduction in shipping. The Maml≈´k sultan may be unable to afford more maml≈´ks (slave soldiers) imported from the Black Sea. Offensively, the fleet would launch attacks on Egypt to draw Egyptian forces away from the Holy Land. The Liber ignores completely the question of financing the expedition.

It is located on the southwest side of Place Seffarine, across from the Madrasa Saffarin and south of the Qarawiyyin Mosque.  History  The hammam dates back to the 14th century during the Marinid period. It was probably originally intended to cater to the local coppersmiths who worked in the boutiques and workshops around Place Seffarine. It is one of many hammams which have survived in the city, thanks in part to the continued popularity of the hammam in Moroccan culture over the centuries and to the present day. Local inhabitants associate this hammam with the tombs of two Sufi Muslim saints, Sidi Tallouk and Sidi Ahmad Skalli, although no physical tombs are visible and the exact relation between the hammam and the saints is not clearly established. Nonetheless, the baraka (blessings) of the saints are often believed to contribute to the purification that can be achieved at the hammam. This popular or mystical association with certain Muslim saints characterizes many hammams in Fez. The hammam has generally preserved its traditional layout. It was recently underwent restoration under the supervision of architect Rachid Halaoui, as part of an Austrian-led project to restore various historic hammams across the Mediterranean region.  Social function  The Saffarin Hammam and other hammams in traditional Moroccan urban centers plays an important social and spiritual role. They allowed for the local population, especially the poorer inhabitants, to perform ablutions as well as maintaining general health and cleanliness. Even today, it is still serves as an economically accessible facility for poorer urban residents. The hammam was also involved in other cleanliness rituals and traditions associated with weddings, childbirths, and circumcision. Newlyweds come to the hammam for washing and prayer and have a special corner reserved for them where they light candles. Women who have given birth also come to the hammam to receive a special massage. Accordingly, hammams were also important spaces for women as they were one of the few public institutions that provided them with a female-only space outside the home. (Most hammams had separate hours of operation for men and women, while the Saffarin hammam was one of the few to have separate facilities for both.) Women have thus also been instrumental in passing down many of the social traditions associated with the hammam.  Architecture and operation  As with some other hammams in the city, the Saffarin Hammam is situated next to a well or natural spring which provides some of its water and is built in a sloped area which made drainage easier. Like other hammams in the city, the hammam structure is not very prominent from the exterior, but is recognizable from the rooftops by its pierced domes which are characteristic of hammam architecture. From Place Seffarine it is marked only by a horseshoe arch entrance, from which a bent passage leads to the interior. The layout of the hammam is similar to that of most historic bathhouses in the city and was inherited from the Roman bathhouse model. The first room entered from the street, and the largest, was the undressing room (mashlah in Arabic or goulsa in the local Moroccan Arabic dialect), equivalent to the Roman apodyterium. The undressing room of the Saffarin Hammam distinguished itself by being more richly decorated than that of most Moroccan hammams. The chamber consists of a large square marked out by four columns, covered by a large high dome, which is set inside a large square whose corners are covered by four smaller much domes. The main dome and the arches of the chamber are decorated with carved stucco motifs, while the lower walls are covered in zellij tilework. The southwestern wall of the chamber features a wall fountain decorated with colourful geometric patterns in zellij, below which is a water basin. The chamber also includes seats and storage lockers around its perimeter. Near the entrance is also a reception area or desk where visitors can pay for services. Visitors were generally entitled to four or five buckets of water, and had to pay if they wanted more. From the undressing room visitors proceeded to the bathing/washing area which consisted of three rooms. Among the historic hammams in Fes, the Saffarin Hammam is unique in having separate rooms for men and women. This allowed the hammam to be open to both sexes all day long, instead of holding separate opening hours for men and women. The three rooms, in order, are: the cold room (el-barrani in the local Arabic dialect), equivalent to the frigidarium, the middle room or warm room (el-wasti in Arabic), equivalent to the tepidarium, and the hot room (ad-dakhli in Arabic), equivalent to the caldarium. All three rooms are covered in vaulted roofs. The warm rooms also have small side chamber or alcoves which can provide additional privacy for bathers. The passage leading from the undressing room to the cold room also gave access to a set of latrines (toilets today) along the way. The hammam had two furnaces (one for the women's section and one for the men's section) which, for efficiency, were located at the back of the complex right behind the hot rooms, but at a lower level than the adjoining chambers. The warm and hot rooms were heated using a traditional hypocaust system just as Roman bathhouses did. Hot smoke from the fires passed under the floors of the rooms and then rose through flues inside the walls and up to the chimneys. Water was heated in two enormous brass cauldrons (fabricated in the workshops of Place Seffarine outside) which were placed over the fires. The heated water was then carried and poured into a large water basin (called a burma) in the middle of the hot room. From this basin, water was also carried in buckets to the warm room. The furnaces require constant fuel and thus needed to be manned by labourers throughout the hammam's hours of operation. Fuel, which was transported directly to the hammam on the backs of donkeys, was provided by wood but also by recycling the waste by-products of other industries in the city such as wood shavings from carpenters' workshops and olive pits from the nearby olive presses. This traditional system continued to be used even up to the 21st century.

Justin and Clement (), also known as the Camaldolese Abbey of St. Justin (), is a former Italian monastery in the city of Volterra, Pisa, which was founded in the 11th century. It was a major religious institution of the region until it was initially abandoned by the monks due to earthquake damage in the 19th century and then taken over and dissolved under the Risorgimento movement for the political unification of the Italian peninsula. For most of its history, it operated as a monastery of Camaldolese monks. Origins The site of the abbey was the shrine housing the remains of Justin and Clement, two African Christians, possibly brothers, who, according to tradition, had arrived in Volterra in AD 537 as refugees from the invasion of their homeland by the Visigoths. They soon began to preach the orthodox Christian faith to the local populace there, many of whom were adherents of Arianism. After successfully leading a resistance to the siege of the Ostrogoth king, Totila, Justin was declared the first Catholic bishop of the city. Clement was made a priest under his rule. After their deaths, the two religious leaders became venerated as patron saints of the city. According to tradition, the first religious structures on the site were two chapels built at the burial sites of the saints during the second half of the 6th century. After the destruction of these original chapels, during the Lombard invasions, they were rebuilt and expanded at the end of the 7th century by the head of the guilds of the city, named Alchis. Around the year 1030, the complex was completely renovated by Gunfredus of Novara, the bishop of the city, in an effort to renew devotion to those saints. At that time, he replaced the two chapels with a larger church, known as San Giusto al Botro. At that same time, he founded a Benedictine monastery on nearby Monte Nibbio, under the dedication of the Holy Savior () to which he entrusted the care of the Church of Sts. Justin and Clement, in addition to their monastic church. Camaldolese era In 1113, the monks of St. Justin joined the Camaldolese Order. About 1340, Abbot Fazio of Ravenna hired painters from the School of Giotto to do a series of paintings in both the shrine church and the abbey church. In 1485, however, the monks lost their independence as Abbot Giusto di Gherardo Buonvici surrendered control of the monastery to Cardinal Giovanni di Medici, who later became Pope Leo X. During this subsequent period, the monks came under the rule of a commendatory abbot, who was not a member of the monastery or even a monk. Mario Maffei, brother of Raffaele Maffei and a member of a notable family of the city, was named commendatory abbot in 1515. Both he and his successor, Giovanni Battista Riccobaldi del Bava, began a number of renovation projects to restore the monastery. This work lasted from about 1520-1550. With this project, they began to embellish and expand the monastic complex, starting with the cloister of the monastery, which was rebuilt according to the design of the noted Florentine architect, Bartolomeo Ammannati. This was followed by a major renovation of the refectory, where the monks had their meals, under the hands of master stonecutters Bartolomeo Sandrini of Fiesole and Cosimo da Volterra. They restored the damage caused to the chamber during the period of 1530-1532 when the monks were forced to flee the abbey due to a siege of the city by the Republic of Florence. Del Bava ended the commendatory abbacy in 1562, returning control of the monastery to the Camaldolese Order. In 1597, the refectory was further embellished with a large series of frescoes painted by Donato Mascagni depicting the lives of the patron saints of the house. In the following century, the monks began work on the shrine church to which the monastery was attached, which was to become known as San Giusto Nuovo (the New St. Justin Church). The architect for this new monastic church is generally credited to have been Giovanni Coccapani. In 1808, under the Napoleonic occupation of northern Italy, the abbey was suppressed, as part of the general closure of religious houses under French rule. In 1816, however, after the fall of the First French Empire, the Camaldolese were able to retake possession of the monastery. It was abandoned, however, after an earthquake devastated the abbey in 1846, and, seeing the decrepit state of the complex, with the fear of further earthquake damage and pressure from the political scene, the monks left the abbey and moved to the former monastery of the Friars Minor in the city. The monastery was definitively lost to the Catholic Church after Italian unification. In 1866, the land and buildings of the abbey were acquired by the Kingdom of Italy, which sold some of them to private parties and rented other portions. With the continued deterioration of the buildings, and partial collapse due to earthquakes, the property passed back and forth between the Italian government and the City of Volterra. Currently the property is mostly owned and cared for by the Cassa di Risparmio of Volterra.

Initially focused on economic advancement for the islands, it came to advocate for greater self-rule. It was an ancestor of the Cook Islands Party. Foundation The Association was founded in November 1944 in Rarotonga and was primarily supported by local planters. Its initial demands were the establishment of co-operative trading stores and for a ship to enable cash- crops to be exported independently of the irregular service provided by the monopoly Union Steam-ship Company. In April 1945 Cook Island workers returning from working in the phosphate mines on Makatea complained of poor working conditions, low wages, insufficient food and indenture which amounted to virtual blackbirding. Their contracts had been negotiated directly between the Compagnie des Phosphates de l'Oc√©anie and the New Zealand government. A petition to the Resident Commissioner was not forwarded to Wellington, and the issue was taken up in New Zealand by the local Cook Islands community and the Auckland Trades Council, resulting in a government inquiry. The Auckland Cook Islands community subsequently formed an Auckland branch of the Association in October 1945, which in November 1945 elected Albert Henry as its secretary. This branch subsequently became dominant in the Association, and drew up a program demanding higher wages, improved shipping, a Cook Islands representative in the New Zealand Parliament, fully elected islands councils, an elected federal islands government, and the abolition of the Resident Commissioner's power to veto legislation. Industrial campaign In January 1946 the CIPA organised a strike for higher wages by Avarua harbour workers a few days before the Union Steamship Company's Maui Pomare arrived in Rarotonga. The strike was successful, and resulted in a significant increase in membership for the CIPA: by May 1946 it claimed 3,000 financial members, roughly half the population. The New Zealand government subsequently formed a government sponsored union, the Cook Islands Workers Union, in an effort to prevent future unrest. In December 1947 a dispute between CIPA and CIWU supporters on Manihiki saw 14 people arrested and held at the local courthouse. At the same time the Maui Pomare was blacklisted by the CIPA over its use of CIWU labour. When two CIPA members were arrested, a large group of protestors marched on the administration building and forced their release. The Pomare cancelled its next visit, and subsequent ships were greeted with pickets. Fearing further strife, in March 1948 the New Zealand government sent a force of New Zealand police to maintain order, and gazetted regulations forbidding strikes. The police remained in place until November, and the CIPA gave up its industrial campaign. Post-1948 activities After 1948, the CIPA focused on economic development, acquiring a ship for inter-island transport and establishing a Producer's Cooperative Society. Both ventures subsequently failed. The CIPA maintained a skeleton existence for the next 14 years. It contested the 1956 Cook Islands general election, winning three of the six Maori seats on Rarotonga. In 1963, as self-government approached, it began talks with the Industrial Union of Workers and the co-operative movement on the formation of a new political group. When Albert Henry returned to the Cook Islands in March 1964, the three groups agreed to unite, leading to the formation of the Cook Islands Party.

He also questioned the film's depiction of rebel communists as a rigid and severe group, for during the early 1970s the rebels would have been more concerned with widening its base than punishing wayward citizens within its controlled territory. Diaz also noted that many viewers were disappointed with the film due to expecting an action-packed story, when instead they were given \\"an orientation of the problems affecting our society\\".

They released their debut single, \\"While You're Out Looking for Sugar\\", in 1969. But their biggest success came in 1971 when they topped the Billboard Hot 100 with the hit \\"Want Ads\\" from the album Soulful Tapestry. The song spent one week at No. 1, and also spent three weeks atop the R&B; chart. The record was certified gold by the RIAA, and their next single \\"Stick-Up,\\" also went gold. The trio split up in 1973. Wright married musician Greg Perry, who co-wrote and produced many of Honey Cone's recordings at Hot Wax. In 1977, she released her only solo album, Oops! Here I Go Again, on RCA Victor, which Perry produced. In the 1980s and 1990s, Wright sang backup for various musical acts, including U2, Kim Carnes, Aaron Neville and Andra√© Crouch.

Presley fully admitted his guilt, and as a result of a plea agreement, he was given several terms of life imprisonment without parole.  Biography  Aeman Presley was born in 1980, in Chicago, Illinois. Soon after his birth, his father abandoned the family, as a result of which his mother had to raise Aeman by herself. Due to the family's financial difficulties, Presley had to work at several different places, resulting in him roaming the streets as a youth and adolescent, which greatly affected his personality. In 1992, he joined a gang associated with the Folk Nation and began committing small-time offenses. In order to change this unhealthy lifestyle, Presley and his mother left Chicago in 1995, moving to Stone Mountain, Georgia, a small town with a population of about 6,000. There, Aeman attended the local Stone Mountain High School. In December 1995, as part of a journalistic investigation into the life of juvenile delinquents in the state, Presley, along with several other teens, gave an interview to the TimesDaily, describing his experience as a former gang member. After graduating high school, he joined the Georgia National Guard, but was fired in the early 2000s, returning to his mother's home in Stone Mountain, where he worked low-skilled labour-intensive jobs. As a result of his financial situation, Presley began to exhibit antisocial and violent behavior, developing a drug addiction as well. In December 2002, he was fired from Carmike Cinemas after repeatedly threatening visitors and co- workers alike. In the immediate aftermath, he threatened to kill his former supervisor, who called the police. Aeman was arrested, but avoided prison time, and was instead given a fine and compulsory anger management courses, which he attended for the next several months. On April 19, 2003, Presley was arrested on charges of assault after beating his mother, heavily resisting the officers and attempting to break the police car's windows while being transported to the station. He was found guilty, but some of the charges were dropped, as his mother came to an agreement with him, with Aeman apologising for his actions. He received a minor sentence, and after his release, he returned to his mother's house. In March 2006, he was rearrested for indecent behavior, and in April of that year, he was convicted and sentenced to several months imprisonment, which he served in the county jail. Released at the end of 2006, he moved to Atlanta, where he representatives of the show business. Thanks to their support, he got a job at an Atlanta TV station, and for the next four years, he worked as an extra in TV shows and news reports. Between 2008 and 2009, he performed supporting roles in the low-budget short films \\"Exit\\" and \\"The Rules\\", after which he decided he wanted to become a professional actor. In 2010, Presley left Georgia and moved to Los Angeles, where he rented an apartment and enrolled in the Margie Haber Studio, an acting school based in Beverly Hills. However, his film career did not work out. Despite his previous experience, his acting abilities were considered unconvincing, due to which, over the next three years, he was forced to act as a simple extra during the filmings of various films, inable to pass a single casting to get a role in serious film projects. He spent most of his time at home, drinking alcohol and using drugs. In May 2014, he was detained by the Los Angeles police on charges of illegal drug possession, but was released a day later, due to the lack of a judicial arrest warrant. After an arrest warrant was issued and his apartment searched, Presley left Los Angeles and returned to Atlanta.  Serial murders  Taurus Raging Bull, the weapon used in the murders After returning to Atlanta, Presley took odd jobs and lived in a homeless shelter. In August, he purchased a five-round Taurus Raging Bull revolver, with which he decided to commit robberies. On September 26th, he boarded a bus and travelled to DeKalb County, where he came across 53-year-old Kelvin Golston, whom he shot three times. The victim was a schizophrenic dromomaniac, due to which, at the time of his killing, he had been living among the homeless in the parking lot of a local shopping center. On November 23rd, Presley stumbled upon 42-year-old vagrant Dorian Jenkins, who was sleeping on one of Atlanta's streets. Aeman proceeded to shoot him three times in the chest. Three days later, he shot and killed another homeless man, 68-year-old Tommy Mims, who was sleeping under a railway bridge. After killing Mims, Presley searched for another victim, but instead of committing other robberies that day, he returned to the crime scene, deciding to fire two additional shots in the dead man's head. On the night of December 6th, Presley travelled to Decatur. In the following early morning, he noticed 44-year-old Karen Pearce heading towards her car, which was parked in a nearby parking lot. He went up to her and threatened to shoot her with his revolver. Pearce gave up all her valuables, but nevertheless, Aeman proceeded to shoot her, killing Karen on the spot.  Arrest  Aeman Presley was arrested on December 11th, while trying to pass the underground turnstile without a ticket. He was searched by the officers, who found a bank card, the revolver and a bag of 32 rounds among his personal belongings. He was charged with illegal weapons possession, and taken to the local police station. After a forensic ballistic examination confirmed that the four victims had been killed with the exact gun that he was carrying, Aeman began cooperating with the investigators, confessing to all the murders.  Trial  In September 2015, Presley's trial began at the DeKalb County District Court for the murders of Galston and Pearce. As the result of a plea bargain, he was spared the death penalty and sentenced to two life imprisonment terms without parole in June 2016. After the verdict was announced, Aeman declared to be remorseful for what he had done, and asked the victims' relatives for forgiveness. Following his conviction, in January 2017, Presley stood trial in Fulton County for the murders of Jenkins and Mims. He pleaded guilty to both murders, claiming that after he had killed the first victim, he got addicted to murder, but also declared that he shouldn't be subjected to criminal liability due to his insanity.

Painted around 1887, it shows a coastal landscape elaborated in a Pointillist technique. Van Rysselberghe probably adopted the Pointillist manner after befriending Signac; however, the use of color in Sailboats and Esuary is nonetheless far more realistic than in paintings by Signac and other Neo-Impressionists, and reveals a tendency towards naturalism. The artwork has been in the collection of the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris since 1982, on loan from the Louvre. Context Van Rysselberghe was one of the founders of the Brussels progressive association Les XX, and played a leading role in the communication between Belgian and French artists. He regularly traveled to Paris to meet fellow painters and to visit exhibitions. When, in 1886, during the last major Impressionist exhibition Georges Seurat presented what would become the leading example of pointillist technique, namely A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Van Rysselberghe initially voiced reservations about it in an exchange of letters with his friend Emile Verhaeren. In 1887, however, he was the one who arranged for the work to be shown in an exhibition of Les XX, along with six coastal landscapes that Seurat created in Grandcamp and Honfleur. One year later, Van Rysselberghe organized an exhibition in Brussels with Neo-Impressionist painters such as Paul Signac, Henri-Edmond Cross and Albert Dubois-Pillet. In the meantime he had also adopted the pointillist method himself, both in his portraits and landscapes. One of the earliest examples is the canvas he probably painted around 1887, or 1889, that is Sailboats and Estuary. Painting In the late 1880s, Van Rysselberghe painted a number of pointillist works on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany, which seem to have been inspired by the coastal views of Grandcamp and Honfleur realized by Seurat, whose waterscapes often draw the viewer in with a close-up view of land or a pier at the side of the canvas, and then give way to an expanse of ocean and sky separated by a thin wedge of land. The work is unsigned and was in a private collection for a long time until 1982.Cf. Genevi√©ve Lacombe, conservator van het Mus√©e d'Orsay in Mus√©e d'Orsay: impressionist and post- impressionist paintings. Zij geeft als ontstaansjaar 1892. De website van het Museum vermeldt thans 1889. Sailboats and Estuary, or Access to the Port of Roscoff, is typical of both the theme and the neo-impressionist style that Van Rysselberghe had learned directly from the movement's leading artists: he started entirely from the theory of color as defined by Seurat, more specifically, his \\"doctrine of simultaneous contrasts\\", which he had studied extensively. He meticulously juxtaposes unmixed dark blue, crimson, yellow, green and white brushstrokes against each other in arithmetically determined proportions, as in a kind of mosaic. Ultimately this leads to an extremely balanced, tightly styled composition, with an almost classical rigor. In a synthetic way he allows the fragmented color keys to flow into a monochrome overall image, where the separate color keys blocks give an almost glittering effect. With this he achieves the maximum effect of the special light effect propagated by Seurat in his color theory, also referred to as luminism. A reviewer of the Parisian art magazine La Plume wrote about the painting on April 1, 1898 \\"it shows in all its facets the full luminous beauty that the new pointillist school can offer.\\"Cf.

She was later married to Alauddin Khalji and her son Shihabuddin Omar was appointed as the successor of Alauddin, after his death. History The hill of Devagiri, the capital of Yadavas, the dynasty to which Jhatyapali belonged. In a bid to fulfil his desire of territorial expansion, Alauddin first raided Deogiri in 1296. The Deogiri at the time of his raid was ruled by Rai Ramchandra, the Yadava ruler, with his son Simhana as the supreme commander of the Yadava army. Simhana was on an expeditionary mission during Alauddin's invasion and Ramchandra was not able to withstand the invading army from Delhi. Though Yadava gave formidable challenge to Alauddin they were not able to cope up with the situation due to absence of Simhana from the battlefield. Ramchandra then sent a message of truce, which was welcomed by Alauddin as he wanted to return Delhi as soon as possible. They came to an agreement in which a large amount of wealth along with precious gifts were given to Alauddin as war indemnity. Ramchandra Dev also promised to pay annual tribute to him, which made the treaty possible. After his return to the Deogiri, Simhana came to know about the derogatory peace treaty with Delhi and he pressed his father to stop paying tribute in a bid to express his independence from the subordination. The failure of Ramchandra to pay the annual tribute dragged Alauddin's attention to the Deogiri once again. After his successful expeditions of Chittor and Malwa, Alauddin was compelled to send two armies to Deogiri for a second showdown. This time Yadavas were routed; as the combined forces of Delhi, one which was sent to displace Rai Karana Singh Vaghela, the Rajput ruler of Gujarat, who was defeated earlier by Alauddin and was seeking refuse at Baglana on the border of south Gujarat and another particularly for Deogiri campaign under Malik Kafur pushed their way into Yadava's territory. There was a strict order from the Alauddin to his Generals to not harm the family of Rai. Hence, Rai along with his kinsmen were brought to Delhi in an honourable way while Deogiri was left under the charge of Simhana. After keeping him as his guest in Delhi for some time; Rai was honoured with a canopy (the royal insignia) and vast amount of wealth was bestowed upon him. Nausiri, a territory of Gujarat was also awarded to him as gift. During this time, Ramchandra decided to give his daughter Jhatyapali in marriage to Alauddin. The bride was accepted and the relations of Deogiri with Delhi reached new heights. Life as Empress Shihabuddin Omar, the son of Jhatyapali, who was merely six years old was appointed by Malik Kafur, the slave General of Alauddin as his successor while the other sons of Alauddin including Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah were either blinded or detained. This was done by Kafur to strengthen his holds upon the Sultanate. According to Ferishta, in order to legitimise his rule Malik Kafur married Jhatyapali and became the step-father of the boy Sultan. The fate of Alauddin's family engineered by Kafur to fulfill his ambitions was not liked by some of the earlier nobles and bodyguards (Paiks) of Alauddin, who plotted and assassinated Kafur, which was followed by freeing of Mubarak Shah, another adult son of Alauddin. Mubarak Shah took over the affairs of state in his hand as the regent and for some time his younger brother Shihabuddin was restored as the Sultan. After working as regent for some time, Mubarak complained that Jhatyapali, the queen mother had conspired to poison him and taking it as pretext, he sent Shihabuddin as prisoner to Gwalior, where he was blinded but no step was taken against Jhatyapali. Death In 1320, Khusrau Khan, the General and partner of homosexual Sultan Qutubuddin Mubarak Shah, raised the army of Baradus, a Hindu military clan. He assassinated Sultan and in order to eliminate all the possible claimants to the throne, he attacked royal Harem. All the surviving princes were ordered to be killed. Jhayatapali, the mother of Mubarak Shah was also killed during the Coup.

Biography Mihai Pelin was born towards the end of August 1940 in CernƒÉu»õi, which had been occupied by the USSR at the time. His father (Spiridon) was a railway worker while his mother was a housewife, and a part of his family had Polish and German roots. During WW2, Pelin spent his time with his grandmother in Bessarabia along with German troops, before leaving for Bucharest in 1944. He graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy in Bucharest and in his early years he was a journalist for various magazines and newspapers, including FlacƒÉra and Sc√¢nteia Tineretului. His first written work was published in 1967, and he later moved to the city of Craiova in 1972. In 1977, at the centenary of the Romanian Independence War (which was fought as part of the Russo-Ottoman war), he published \\"The fall of Plevna\\", which gained him a prize from the Romanian Writers' Union. He returned to Bucharest in 1981, moving into a newly finished apartment block near Obor where he lived until his death. During the 1980s, he began researching the role of Italy in the Eastern Front of the WW2, frequently travelling to cities such as Milan and Venice. He began gaining notoriety after the Romanian Revolution, where he intensified his travels to Italy and began to openly write about the history of the secret services in Romania, especially through his work \\"The white files of the Securitate\\", published in the mid 1990s.

Platt is known for her youth and for going on peaceful strikes to voice out environmental concerns. She is the Global Ambassador of YouthMundus, Earth.org, and WODI; youth ambassador for Plastic Pollution Coalition and How Global; and child ambassador for the World Cleanup Day. Platt initially went viral on social media after posting litter of plastic she picked up‚Äîsorted accordingly. Over the years she has picked up more than 100,000 of pieces of litter. Platt was born in Britain. Her family moved to Netherlands when she was seven years old. Environmentalism In 2015, Platt was walking along a park in the Netherlands with her grandfather when she noticed litter of plastic scattered on the ground. She decided to count them to practice her Dutch. They gathered 91 pieces of plastic within 10 minutes. Her grandfather further told her how the trash ends up as plastic soup. The said incident triggered her environmental initiative, and at 7 years old, she started Lilly's Plastic Pickup. Through Lilly's Plastic Cleanup she picks up litter and sorts them meticulously. She posts them on social media so as to raise awareness on the issue. Over the years Platt has picked up more than 100,000 pieces of trash, ranging from bottles, cigarette packets, drink cartons etc. Through Lilly's Plastic Cleanup, Platt also shares the effect of plastic on wildlife and the ecosystem. Since going viral her initiative has garnered international acclaim. Ever since she was a child, Platt has shown fondness for animals, particularly those considered physically unappealing. She was bullied in school because of this, and only one of her peers showed interest in her cleanup activities. Platt then moved to The King's School where many of her classmates participated in her clean-up efforts. In the 2019 Dutch elections, Platt's grandfather voted on her behalf, as she is campaigning for the ban of plastic. Platt took a video and encouraged others to do the same. In September 2019, Platt saw Greta Thunberg's protest outside the Swedish Parliament concerning the enforcement of Paris Agreement. She was inspired and decided to go on strike too. After a few weeks, Greta Thunberg joined Platt's strikes in the Netherlands, considering the Netherlands had been one of the highest emitters of greenhouse gas in the European Union. Both were invited to Brussels where they attended a climate rally outside the European Parliament. Every Friday, Platt goes on strike outside government buildings to protest regarding the climate crisis, with or without company.

Life  Born in Schweinfurt, Jan, the eldest son of the classical philologist and grammar school headmaster (1807‚Äì1869), turned to the special field of ancient music already during his studies. During his studies he became a member of the Christian student fraternity of in the winter semester 1853/54. (ed.): List of members of the Schwarzburgbund. Fourth edition, Bremerhaven 1908, , No. 234. He received his doctorate in 1859 at the Humboldt University of Berlin with the dissertation De fidibus graecorum (\\"On the Stringed Instruments of the Greeks\\"). Jan received his first teaching position at the Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster, whose headmaster was also concerned with the music of ancient Greece. During the short time of their collaboration, Jan received numerous suggestions from Bellermann. In 1862, he moved to the Gymnasium in Landsberg an der Warthe, where he took over not only the Old Languages but also singing lessons and the school orchestra, and performed concerts with which he financed the school's new organ. Because of disagreements with the Landsberg town council, Jan moved to Saargem√ºnd in 1875, where he also conducted the school choir. In 1883, he was appointed professor at the Lyceum in Strasbourg.Musici scriptores graeci on Google Books Jan died in Adelboden at the age of 63.  Achievements  Jan was one of the most important researchers in the field of ancient Greek music. He belonged to a generation of researchers who raised the still young science of musicology from mere aestheticization \\"to a real science on a par with other disciplines\\". In his writings, he dealt with the function and playing technique of ancient stringed and wind instruments. He found, for example, that the sound of an aulos does not resemble that of a flute, as the common translation suggests, but rather that of a clarinet.Die Griechischen Saiteninstrumente, von Dr. Karl von Jan on Worldcat Jan followed with great interest the new papyrus finds in the 1990s of the 19th century. He took an active part in the critical publication and order of the fragments. His large edition Musici scriptores Graeci (Leipzig 1895) collected the fragments with text-critical annotations, without attempting to edit them for modern performances. Jan also gave examples of how to translate them into modern music notation, which he published in a new edition in 1899. The work, accompanied by numerous preliminary studies, was reprinted unchanged in 1962 and 1995 and is considered Jan's most important publication, as it replaces the long outdated Antiquae musicae auctores septem by Marcus Meibom (1652). Jan also got involved in the research debate on the harmonics of kithara music and stood up to the predominant expert in this field, Rudolf Westphal. Westphal's speculations about possible harmonic laws were largely rejected by Jan and he argued that one should limit oneself to what is certainly recognizable in the ancient theory of harmony. After his death, the positions of both researchers were abandoned. In addition to ancient music, Jan was also interested in medieval and early modern music, especially Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Heinrich Sch√ºtz.Jan, Karl von on Deutsche Biographie He was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle, 4th class.Leopold Petri (ed.): Mitgliederverzeichnis des Schwarzburgbundes.

Locals called the light railway Tacot Allemand.V.M.: Vall√©e de Vill√© ‚Äì La guerre du ¬´ Tacot ¬ª 11 November 2018.  Route  The Lordonbahn light railway network consisted of a long main line from Vill√© to Chaume de Lusse and three branches from Col d'Urbeis to Lubine, from Wegspinne to Trois Maisons and from Gare du Lusshoff- les-Yraux to the hamlet of La Pouxe. The route with a gauge of 600 mm ran along the Val de Vill√© in Alsace to the high Col de Urbeis, where it crossed the border to France. Behind the border a branch branched off to the west to Lubine. At Wegspinne (German for track spider) station, another branch line branched off to the east to Trois Maisons from the main line leading south to Lusshof station (Chaume de Lusse). The Lusshof was above today's Tunnel Maurice-Lemaire at a station of the Eberhardt aerial tramway to Klein Rumbach (Petit Rombach). From Lusshof, a branch line led around an high mountain peak to the Terminale station at La Pouxe near Wisembach with another branch to the top station of a cable car at Les Yraux Fermes.  Operation  On 31 December 1917 five military steam loco¬≠motives, eight benzene locomotives and 97 wagons were in use on the Lordonbahn, which were operated and maintained by 193 men. 77 of them belonged to the 24th Bavarian Brigade and 87 were soldiers from other military units. They were supported by 19 civilians and 10 prisoners of war from Russia and Romania. Every day, an average of 160 tons of weapons, ammunition and supplies were transported on 6 round trips with 32 wagons, as well as wounded soldiers in the opposite direction.

Yes, Your Grace focuses around managing a small kingdom, where the player must manage a finite amount of resources. The game went through a multi-year development cycle, where it was heavily influenced by winter conditions in Poland. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Gameplay Yes, Your Grace is a management game about ruling a kingdom. It focuses around the player character, King Eryk of Davern, and rests heavily on binary choices about how to respond to various events in their Kingdom. Gameplay is organized into weekly rounds, with events presented as from visitors to their royal court. The player must manage money and supplies, while also managing the military, and a limited number of generals, witches and hunters. Development Yes, Your Grace was originally inspired by the 2015 game Papers, Please and the 2012 game Crusader Kings II. Development of the game began with a campaign on Kickstarter in 2015. The game was in development for five years, for the majority of the development cycle it was being developed in a village in Poland. The relative remoteness of the village was a significant factor in development, as the landscape and the harshness of winters had a substantial impact on game design. Release and revenue Yes, Your Grace was released on Steam and GOG.com on March 6, 2020, with it making $600,000 in its release weekend, a number considered a success. The game's success was attributed to an effective trailer, as well as the availability of translations into numerous different languages on release. Reception Yes, Your Grace received generally positive reviews from critics. Nicole Carpenter, writing in Polygon, spoke positively of the game, praising its slow pacing and ability to counter savescumming. Paul Tamayo, writing in Kotaku, gave a positive review, declaring that the game a \\"fun anxiety outlet\\" and a \\"really cool throwback\\", while criticising what he perceived as some situations resembling \\"conservative radio nightmare simulations\\". Luke Kemp of PC Gamer also gave a positive review, praising the game's writing and finding that its animation was especially good, while criticising perceived distracting atmosphere shifts. Rob Mundy of Nintendo Life gave the game 7/10 stars, praising the game's writing and depiction of medieval life, while finding that it \\"C[ould] feel unfairly punishing\\". Chris Bratt, writing in PCGamesN also gave the game 7/10, praising the characterisation of the relationship between King Eryk and his family, while finding that the game lacked truly impactful decisions, as he found that most major events were somewhat railroaded. Rob Gordon of ScreenRant gave a mixed review, finding that the game's plot \\"shined\\" and praising its characterisation, while also finding that the game's abundance of binary choices in events led to frustration, as in his view relatively minor things took up too many resources. Malindy Hetfield, writing in Eurogamer, gave a negative review, stating that the game did not inspire any feelings towards its characters, and also that it was both mechanically frustrating and suffered from tone inconsistencies, though she praised the game's visuals.

His theories on the identity of Germanic peoples have had a major influence on contemporary research by historians of late antiquity. Biography Reinhard Wenskus was born in Saugen, East Prussia, Germany on 10 March 1916. After graduating from high school in Tilsit, East Prussia, Wenskus began working as a commercial apprentice there. He served as a soldier in the German Army during World War II. After the war, Wenskus gained his abitur in Hanover and subsequently studied history, ethnology and Germanistics at the University of Marburg. He received his PhD in 1954 under the supervision of Helmut Beumann. Wenskus subsequently worked as a research assistant, and gained his habilitation at Marburg in 1959 with the thesis Stammesbildung und Verfassung. He was subsequently appointed Docent at Marburg. In 1963, Wenskus succeeded Percy Ernst Schramm as Professor of Medieval History at the University of G√∂ttingen. He became a Member of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1969. Wenskus retired from G√∂ttingen in 1981, but continued to teach and research. He died in G√∂ttingen on 5 July 2002. Research Wenskus specialized in medieval history, particularly that of Prussia and the Teutonic Order, and the history, historiography and constitution of medieval Germanic peoples. Throughout his career, Wenskus was distinguished by his emphasis on interdisciplinary research. In addition to being a historian by profession, Wenskus was highly learned in linguistics, archaeology and ethnology, and sought to use evidence from these disciplines as a way to get a better understanding of history. Along with Herbert Jankuhn, Kurt Ranke, Hans Kuhn and Schramm, Wenskus was a co-founder of the second edition of the Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde, to which he contributed a large number of articles. In his Stammesbildung und Verfassung (1961), Wenskus argued that Germanic peoples were not organized upon biological kinship, but instead based their identity upon being led by small warrior elite who maintained the core tradition () of the tribe. He also theorized that the \\"barbarian\\" peoples of the Migration Period maintained ethnic identities distinguishing them from the Romance peoples, and referred to this ideology of \\"barbarian\\" ethnic identity as Gentilismus. Wenskus' ideas have been highly influential on modern understanding on \\"barbarian\\" identity. It contributed to the development of the ethnogenesis concept, and the emergence of the Vienna School of History.

Recognized as insane at the time of the murders, he was sent to an undisclosed psychiatric facility to be treated for his mental illness. Biography Beginning in May 1999, young girls and women started disappearing from Prokopyevsk in the span of 10-12 days. The bodies of eight would be found around the various parks and forests surrounding the area, each of them raped before death and subsequently strangled with their own undergarments. As the victims were killed in a similar manner, the authorities were alarmed that a potential serial killer was operating in the city. Numerous witnesses were interviewed, from whose statements, an identikit of the offender was created: aged 35-40, small in stature, noticeable bald patches and a peculiar forelock, a large nose and \\"closed eyes\\". In August 1999, the authorities detained a man matching that exact description: Nikolai Litvin, a local resident and father of three who had convictions for rape. Much to the investigators' surprise, Litvin immediately confessed to the killings, but also revealed about two others which, by that point, were unreported to the authorities. Litvin would later show the burial sites, and additionally admitted that at the time of his capture, he had already marked himself another victim. During the investigations, he claimed that his motive was an ideological hatred towards prostitutes, which contradicted his actions, since several of his victims, including a pregnant woman, had never worked in the sex industry. This, in addition to the contrast of being able to detail his actions to the most miniscule of details, but being unable to recreate the murder despite his hardest efforts, led to Nikolai being examined by researchers at the Serbsky Center in Moscow. The psychiatrists concluded that, at the time of the murders, Litvin had no concrete grasp on reality and thus couldn't understand the gravity of his actions, posing a very serious threat to others around him. As a result, he was sent to a closed psychiatric institution, where he is being nursed to this very day. The case caused a stir in the region, with many locals, even those who lived outside Prokopyevsk, demanding the death penalty for Litvin. Although there are only ten victims officially recorded, some authorities have expressed concern that he could've killed many others prior to his arrest who still haven't been accounted for.

The portrait shows Marguerite in a simple black dress in front of a pastel blue door with a number of gilded ornaments on it. The painting derives its strength from the mysterious, dreamy look in the girl's eyes and the masterfully elaborated background that fully serves the model. R. Fetlkamp, Th√©o van Rysselberghe: 1862-1926, 2003, p 41 - 43 Van Rysselberghe's portraits from this period are often compared to Whistler's works,Herwig Todts, Th√©o Van Rysselberghe: Portret van Marguerite van Mons (1886) uit: Van Henri De Braekeleer tot Emile Claus  realisme en impressionisme but Vel√°zquez, admired by both Van Rysselberghe and Whistler, was also a source of inspiration. The painting is currently housed at the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent. Painting Marguerite van Mons stares at the viewer with a dreamy and absent look. Van Rysselberghe portrayed the girl shortly after the death of her mother. The gloom of the dress is in stark contrast to her pale mien and the soft blue hue of the door with gilded contours. The girl is depicted head-on with her back to the door. Her right hand holds the doorknob as if she had just entered or were about to leave the room. It is this ambiguous gesture and the general melancholic atmosphere that give this seemingly realistic portrait a symbolistic character. The influence of James Abbott McNeill Whistler's portraiture is clearly palpable. Van Rysselberghe became acquainted with his work at the salons of Les Vingt. The painter dedicated the portrait to his friend Emile van Mons, Marguerite's father. References Sources * External links * * Portrait of Marguerite van Mons and Van Rysselberghe lecture.

He gained fame under the patronage of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Life Ratan Singh was from a younger branch of the Rathore ruling family in Jodhpur. At a young age of twenty-three, Ratan Singh, armed with nothing but a dagger fought and killed a mad elephant in the streets of Delhi and impressed its Emperor. Ratan Singh was recruited as an imperial general by Shah Jahan and was posted in Afghanistan as a mansabdar. He continued to gain fame by defeating wild bands of central Asian invaders and by later campaigning against the Persians under the Mughal prince Dara Shukoh. In 1648 he was given a Mughal rank of 3000 horsemen, the standard of Mahi Maratib and the Jagir of Malwa, where he made Ratlam his capital. Ratan Singh was soon informed about Aurangzeb and Murad's betrayal and he immediately came to the aid of Shah Jahan to stop the Mughal princes. Ratan Singh fought the rebel army at Dharmatpur on 15th April 1658, most sources say that the Mughal generals deputed by Shah Jahan either fled or remained inactive throughout the battle. Ratan Singh thus took command of the remaining army and fought till his death.Madhya Pradesh: Ratlam, Pg41, government central press 1994. ‚Äî\\"Kasim Khan remained inactive throughout the battle and Jaswant Singh, before leaving for Marwar, handed over the command of the army to Ratan Singh Rathor.\\"history of modern India from 1526 A.D. to the present day. 3d ed.

As a painter, she exhibited from 1922, initially specializing in child portraits, later in religious works including altarpieces. She embarked on writing in 1926 with a copiously illustrated book on people from her native Sm√•land, the first of many successful works influenced by her strong Christian beliefs and childhood memories. Several were translated into Danish, Dutch, German or English. Early life and education Born on 12 November 1887 in the village of L√•ngasj√∂ in south- eastern Sweden, Anna Elisabeth Albertina Bergstrand was the daughter of the schoolteacher and organist Per Magnus Bergstrand (1855‚Äì1927) and Anna Hammargren (1861‚Äì1946), a devout Christian. She was the second of six children. Brought up in a musical family, her father taught her school subjects and the piano. As the family could not afford to send her to high school, she helped in the home and read widely. She became a close friend of , with whom she shared her interest in art and literature. After studying at the Kunsth√∂gskolan in Stockholm (1909‚Äì1913), thanks to a Swedish grant she went on an extended study trip to France, Italy amd Algeria (1913‚Äì1916). While in Rome, she met the sculptor Rikard Axel Poulsen (1887‚Äì1972) whom she married in November 1917 after returning to Denmark. They had two sons, Ivar (1918) and Hans (1920). Career =As an artist= She first exhibited her child paintings in Copenhagen's Charlottenborg at the 1922 autumn exhibition, followed by interiors at the 1923 spring show. Her portraits and interiors were painted in the naturalistic style of the times. Her artwork extended to etchings, lithography and ceramics. In 1926, her exhibition of some 60 illustrations depicting the people of Sm√•land at the Gummeson Gallery in Stockholm met with enthusiastic acclaim. During the nine years following her marriage, together with her husband she applied her artistic talents to designing their home in Charlottenlund to the north of Copenhagen. Inspired by their common interest in Italy and the Renaissance, it was known as Klosteret (The Cloister) with its impressive church-like appearance. In her memoirs published in 1940, she explains the significance of the house in the following terms: > We love our home, created with irrational materials for a house: longings > and dreams, impressions from east and west, from sun and moon, i.e. from > Italy, Greece, France and Denmark. It was built by man's faith and woman's > weak power. And as an altar erected for all that is beautiful. In later life, she turned to religious works, especially tapestry, creating Kvinnans √•rstider (The Woman's Ages) which was woven in Barbro Nilsson's workshop in Stockholm and is now preserved in Sm√•land's Museum. In 1950, she created an altarpiece for L√•ngasj√∂ Church but it was not inaugurated until 1957, two years after her death. =As a writer= Bergstrand-Poulsen did not embark on her literary career until she was 39 when she published V√§rendskvinnor fr√•n L√•ngasj√∂ socken i bilder och ord (1926), presenting women from her native Sm√•land parish in a richly illustrated book. Other successful works include Hj√§ltar och hj√§lted√•d (1930), Glad och god skal m√§nniskan vara ‚Äì och stark (1934) and V√§ven (1941). All were inspired by her strong Christian beliefs and memories of her childhood in Sm√•land. In 1940 she published her memoirs as H√∂k, f√•r jag l√•na dine vingar? (Hark, Can I Borrow your Wings?). Her most popular works such as V√§ven and Kronan were translated into several languages. Elisabeth Bergstrand-Poulsen died in Charlottenlund on 18 February 1955 and is buried in Ordrup Cemetery.

The systems were installed in the missile test ranges managed by the U.S. Air Force. The systems were first installed in the Eastern Range, at the time the Atlantic Missile Range, and secondly in the Pacific, then known as the Pacific Missile Range. The Atlantic Missile Impact Location System and Pacific Missile Impact Location System were installed from 1958 through 1960. Design and development was by American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;), with its Bell Laboratories research and Western Electric manufacturing elements and was to an extent based on the company's technology and experience developing and deploying the Navy's then classified Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). Early studies were done at Bell Laboratories' Underwater Systems Development Department examined the problem then the Bell System's other organizations began implementation. The company and Navy assets that had installed the first phase of SOSUS, starting in 1951, were engaged on MILS installation and activation. MILS took several forms and each had a unique configuration based on purpose and local water column and bottom conditions. The target arrays were bottom fixed hydrophones connected by cable to the shore stations. A variant, Sonobuoy MILS (SMILS), was composed of bottom mounted hydrophones augmented by air dropped sonobuoys when in use. The third covered wide ocean areas with fixed hydrophones at distant shore sites was termed broad ocean area (BOA) MILS. All systems exploited the SOFAR channel, also known as the deep sound channel, for long range sound propagation in the ocean.An earlier system for location of downed aircraft had established SOFAR stations to detect and localize the explosion of a Sofar bomb. The Navy's Mark 22/0 SOFAR bomb had about four pounds of explosive, to be detonated by downed air crews. Those were very important in early studies of long range ocean acoustics. The classified Sound Surveillance System applied the effect to long range detection of submarine and surface targets. Target arrays The target arrays received the acoustic effect of an object's impact with the ocean surface then by the effect of an explosive charge with location calculated by the difference in arrival times at the hydrophones arranged to form a rough pentagon with a sixth hydrophone at the center. A particular advantage of the pentagon configuration was that a rapid approximate position could be calculated on simple time sequence of the acoustic wave at the hydrophones with detailed analysis producing a more exact location. The effectiveness depended on placement of the hydrophone in the deep sound channel. Since the downrange islands did not offer ocean bottom at that depth in the required configuration a system of suspended hydrophones was used.See referenced page for a diagram. The difficulty of computing the calibration results for the Atlantic systems led to development of computer programs that became the standard for MILS operational data solutions. The distant placement of the systems revealed the limitations of the existing world geodetic system with various datum systems based on the local geoid, something that would be solved by satellite systems that would develop the means to tie everything together. Target arrays were high accuracy systems usually covering a target area of about radius. The Atlantic MILS target arrays were located down range from Cape Canaveral about at Grand Turk Island, at Antigua and at Ascension Island. The Pacific Missile Range (PMR), then Navy managed as a complex of ranges, was one of the three national missile ranges. PMR began installation of a Pacific MILS to support Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) tests with impact areas northeast of Hawaii. That system terminated at the Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay. The IRBM array was operational November 1958. Tests of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) required MILS monitoring impacts between Midway Island and Wake Island and between Wake Island and Eniwetok. The ICBM range was operational in May 1959 with two target arrays. One was located about northeast of Wake and another in the corridor between Wake and Eniwetok. Shore facilities were at Kaneohe and each of the islands. Broad ocean area (BOA MILS) Ascension MILS BOA hydrophones. This system has less accuracy but extensive coverage area including whole ocean basins. It would cover test vehicles not making the target or other events not directly related to the accuracy tests. Accuracy was improved by pre test calibration by a ship precisely located by a fixed transponder field releasing SOFAR bombs. The BOA hydrophones were located near the deep sound channel axis and were located at Cape Hatteras, Bermuda, Eleuthera (Bahamas), Grand Turk, Puerto Rico, Antigua, Barbados and Ascension.The locations correlate to early SOFAR stations, many later engaged in research, and SOSUS shore sites (sometimes also located near earlier SOFAR station/research sites). In the Pacific a BOA system was installed to cover the Wake‚ÄîEniwetok‚ÄîMidway impact area. =Experimental and other uses= The BOA MILS sites were involved in events beyond missile testing. Those included both intentional experiments and acoustic incidents in which they were tasked after the fact to examine records. In some experiments MILS was a major participant while in others participation was mainly monitoring and contributing data. An example of that monitoring role is the nuclear shot \\"Sword Fish\\" in Operation Dominic in which both MILS and SOSUS operated normally simply making recordings and strip charts for a period before the detonation until several hours after. Data has also been provided to support research and support for the International Monitoring System monitoring for nuclear weapons tests. That effort also monitors earthquakes. Acoustic propagation research PARKA I track: Sound channel axis and bottom at critical depth with ocean bottom profile between Kaneohe and Alaska. The Kaneohe BOA array, then part of the Pacific Missile Range, was used in the Long Range Acoustic Propagation Project (LRAPP) series of experiments designated Pacific Acoustics Research Kaneohe Alaska (PARKA). The experiment was required to develop improved models for predicting performance of antisubmarine detection systems and explain the long detection ranges of two to three thousand miles being observed by SOSUS. The Kaneohe shore facility was the operational control center for PARKA I with a hydrophone, bottom sited at , serving as the secondary receiving site. The main receiving site was the research platform FLIP with hydrophones suspended at , and . The MILS hydrophones at Midway and the SOSUS array at Point Sur were also used in the experiment. Heard Island Feasibility Test Bathymetry profile with SOFAR channel axis depth, Heard Island to Ascension Island. The Ascension BOA site had twelve hydrophones in six pairs cabled to the island. All but two pairs were suspended near the deep sound channel. After amplification the signals were fed into a signal processing system. Ascension was one of the observing sites for the Heard Island Feasibility Test conducted to observe both the strength and quality of signals traveling at inter-ocean distances and whether those signals were capable of being used in ocean acoustic tomography. A source ship, , near Heard Island in the Indian Ocean generated signals that were received at Ascension at some distance after passing around Africa. Those signals were received as far away as receiving sites and ships on the east and west coasts of North America. Vela incident The Ascension array was one of the systems involved in the Vela incident acoustic signal. Three hydrophones correlated acoustic arrivals with the time and estimated location of the double flash detected by the Vela satellite. The detailed study of the Naval Research Laboratory that was based on models from French nuclear testing in the Pacific concluded the acoustic detection was of a near surface nuclear explosion in the vicinity of the Prince Edward Islands. Sonobuoy MILS (SMILS) SMILS was exclusively used to support the Navy's fleet ballistic missile programs under the Strategic Systems Project Office with much of the information classified. The range supported the fixed transponder arrays of ten transponders each on a reimbursable basis. The Atlantic range had seven transponder arrays located from to down range. The sonobuoy type impact area used a sonobuoy field, typically four rings apart with outside diameter of , sowed by aircraft and the reference transponder field for geodetic position. SMILS was not dependent on an island downrange and intended for use in remote ocean areas. The transponders were fixed with the sonobuoy field deployed as needed. The specially equipped aircraft did immediate processing with detailed analysis performed later ashore. A special sonobuoy interrogated the transponder field for position of the sonobuoy pattern to the geodetic referenced transponders and another special sonobuoy established the relative of the sonobuoys within the pattern. Before the sonobuoy deployment a special buoy gathered the data to determine actual sound velocity at various depths at deployment time. Data could be collected by specially modified Navy P-3 aircraft or an Advanced Range Instrumentation Aircraft. The P-3 aircraft, flown from Naval Air Station Patuxent River by Air Test and Evaluation Squadron One, were modified to receive and record more sonobuoys, a special timing system and a monitoring and quick look capability. The sonobuoys were modified standard types, in particular with additional battery life and frequencies.

Background  Alere 2 Refugee settlement was established on the 12th of June 1990 in Adjumani District with a surface area of 199 hectares. A boy moving in the refugee camp in Uganda The settlement has hosted South Sudanese refugees fleeing the Second Sudanese war as well as more recent arrivals fleeing the country since 2013. Today, Alere 2 settlement hosts over 6,700 South Sudanese refugees and is closed to new arrivals.  Gaps and Challenges  Food distribution is often delayed and insufficient. Refugees reported that delays were as long as three weeks and that recent reductions in food distribution have led to dietary issues as they do not have enough food to last a month which leaves them at dire need to settle for less and look for what to eat and survive with. The arid and increasingly unpredictable climate of the region with leading to hostile dry seasons and irregular rainfalls combined with low soil fertility and the rocky condition of the land allocated in the settlement have significantly damaged agricultural activities which would have contributed to the increased food production in the refugee camps. Health services are insufficient to meet the needs of the population. The health centre faces a continuous shortage of medications causing patients to travel to Adjumani town to access the medicine they require.  Education  The quality of education received by refugees Alere 2 Refugee settlement has been affected by the quality of teaching, limited staff numbers, language barriers and severe congestion in classrooms. Furthermore, high tuition fees, no school feeding programs and a lack of access to scholarships has led to significant levels of absenteeism and dropouts. Additionally, tuition fees for secondary school and the absence of vocational institutions means many adolescents are left with a feeling of idleness.  Social services  The European Union through EU-TF ( SPRSNU) is financing the construction of Alere 2 Refugee settlement Water Supply and Sanitation System in Adjumani district. The Project components include a transmission network, distribution network, guard house, pump house, chemical house and construction of Public Stand Posts (PSPs) in order to avoid the dangers of lack of water and sanitation services in the camp.  Health and sanitation  A man inspecting toilets in Alere 2 refugee settlement Alere 2 refugee settlement, which has a population of 20,000 refugees, is one of the 18 refugee settlement camps in Adjumani district with the least latrine coverage of 32.6 percent gives refugees in the camp to resort to open defecation, an act that has exposed many to the risk of contracting diseases.

He was a visiting scientist at the Euler International Mathematical Institute (St. Petersburg), the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics (Bonn) and the Leibniz Center for Informatics at Schloss Dagstuhl. Klaus Mainzer initially published on the concept of a number, the fundamentals of geometry, space, time, symmetry and quantum mechanics. He became known as a fundamental theorist of complex systems and artificial intelligence (AI), who considers their social consequences in the age of digitization. He was the first who examined mathematical models of complex systems (e.g., cellular automatons and neural networks) that organize themselves in nature - from molecular and cellular systems to organisms and brains. With Leon O. Chua of University of California, Berkeley, he pointed out that the non-linearity and instability are insufficient to explain new structures (emergence). The prerequisite is the principle of local activity, which mathematically explains the emergence of complex structures on the edge of chaos. In basic mathematical research, he began studying constructive mathematics against the background of Kant's philosophy. Based on degrees of predictability and constructiveness, he researched the extent to which mathematical proofs - and thus human thinking - can be reduced to algorithms and computers. The world's calculation leads again to complex systems and the question of the degree to which they can be digitized (e.g., as quantum information systems). In the technical sciences, Mainzer advocates increased basic research into verification programs to overcome the blind spots of statistical learning algorithms (machine learning) in AI. Complex Systems in the Internet of Things (e.g., Smart Mobility, Industry 4.0) lead to a data explosion (Big Data), which raises security and responsibility issues. In addition to program verification, Mainzer demands technology design that takes social, ecological, ethical and legal aspects into account in the innovation from the outset. In the global competition of world systems, he calls for the European innovation area to reflect on its legacy of individual human rights and to develop artificial intelligence as a service system further.

The aircraft had been abandoned moments earlier by its pilot, who ejected following an on-board fire and loss of control. The pilot and two senior air force officers were later put on trial and found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, receiving a sentence of two and half years in prison, but were subsequently acquitted on appeal.  Accident  The MB-326 took off at 9:48 in the morning of 6 December from Verona Villafranca Airport, around north of Bologna, on a mission to test the effectiveness of an anti-aircraft radar system. The only person on board was the pilot, Sub-lieutenant Bruno Viviani, 24, with 740 flight hours of experience, of which 140 on the MB-326. The planned route involved overflying the village of Borgoforte before heading towards the town of Rovigo. At 10:22, while near Ferrara, the engine stated developing problems, prompting the pilot to abort the mission and seek to land. The nearest airfield at Ferrara had only a 600-metre-long runway, which was insufficient. Therefore, the pilot opted to head for Bologna Airport, around to the south. At 10:31, while approaching Bologna, Viviani reported total engine failure, fire on board and flight controls unresponsive. After attempting to steer the aircraft towards open fields, he ejected and landed near Ceretolo, a village next to Casalecchio di Reno, suffering three fractured vertebrae. An eyewitness at Bologna Airport reported seeing the aircraft on a normal approach path and with the landing gear extended. He then observed flames and white smoke coming out of the engine nozzle, before seeing the aircraft turning in the opposite direction to the airfied, the smoke turning black, and the pilot ejecting from the aircraft, which the eyewitness managed to photograph. The ejection and the flight of the aircraft for the following few seconds were also captured on video by the cameraman of a local TV station, Rete 7, who was filming in the area and happened to notice the unfolding disaster. At 10:33, the pilotless aircraft crashed through the window of a first-floor classroom of the Gaetano Salvemini Technical Institute, a high school in Casalecchio, where a German class was about to finish. At that time, 285 students, 28 teachers and 4 staff were in the building, 17 of whom in the classroom.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved was an Aermacchi MB-326, a single-engine, two-seater jet trainer of the Italian Air Force, with registration number MM54386. Of the 136 aircraft delivered to the Italian Air Force starting from 1960, at the time of the accident only 58 survived, and they had already been replaced as trainer aircraft by the more modern MB-339. By then the MB-326 was used only to quickly connect airbases, tow targets and for miscellaneous roles such as in the accident flight.  Aftermath  The impact created a 7-metre-wide hole in the outer wall and set the classroom on fire. The fuselage and engine careered through the room and crashed through the back wall, sending flames and smoke through the rest of the building and trapping several people on the upper floors. The emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes. A tradesman that was passing by in his van stopped and used his ladder to evacuate the first survivors. Several people jumped to the ground in panic from the upper floors of the building and were injured. The fire brigade then completed the evacuation of the building within half an hour, while paramedics administered first aid on the school's lawn to several injured.  Casualties  Of the sixteen pupils present in the classroom at the time of the crash, all aged 15, twelve ‚Äì eleven girls and one boy ‚Äì were killed in the impact and fire; only four survived: three girls and one boy. The teacher who was giving the lesson survived as well, despite suffering severe burns. Eighty-eight other people were injured: 82 students and 6 adults. Of all the injured, 72 suffered permanent disability of varying degrees. Some of the victims' bodies were burnt beyond recognition, and could be identified by parents and staff members only by looking at items of clothing or jewellery.  Investigation and trial  At the time of the event, Italy's aviation safety agency (Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo) had not yet been established, and the investigation on the accident was carried out by the public prosecutor's office. Viviani and two air force colonels ‚Äì the commander of the 3rd Wing and the officer in charge of Villafranca airbase ‚Äì were charged with multiple involuntary manslaughter and culpable air disaster. The prosecution argued that as soon as the engine started developing troubles, while approaching Ferrara, the pilot should have directed the aircraft to the east towards the Adriatic Sea and then eject, instead of heading towards Bologna's airport, close to a densely populate area. According to the prosecution, the two other officers, who throughout the incident were in radio contact with Viviani from Villafranca, failed to give him proper instructions for a safe resolution of the emergency. In February 1995, the three defendants were found guilty and sentenced to two and a half years in prison each. In January 1997, the Court of Appeal quashed the sentence, ruling that no crime had been committed, and that the conduct of the three defendants during the incident was blameless. In January 1998, the Court of Cassation, Italy's highest court of appeal, rejected the prosecution's request to annul the appeal verdict, therefore definitively confirming the defendant's aquittal.  Legacy  The tragedy left a profound mark in the local community of Casalecchio and surrounding towns. Four different victims' associations were created in the wake of the disaster, which in 1997 merged into the Associazione Vittime del Salvemini ‚Äì 6 dicembre 1990 (Salvemini Victims Association ‚Äì 6 December 1990). The families of the victims never accepted the outcome of the trial, and maintained that justice had not been done. The building struck by the jet was repaired but never returned to school use. In 2001, it reopened as Casa della Solidariet√† \\"Alexander Dubcek\\" (House of Solidarity \\"Alexander Dubcek\\"), a public building hosting the local unit of the Protezione Civile (Italian Civil Protection) and the office of various local charities, including the victims association. The gaping hole in the wall left by the impact has been preserved, closed only by a glass pane, and the classroom hit by the aircraft has been turned into a memorial to the victims. Every year on 6 December, commemorations of the event take place in Casalecchio, endorsed by the municipality of Casalecchio di Reno, with public talks, ceremonies and initiatives on the themes of safety, solidarity and justice.

She has covered major association football leagues and matches for Radio Nacional de Espa√±a (RNE) and Canal+ before moving to Movistar+ to present its coverage of Formula One motor racing from . De Miguel has also covered tennis on television, and has contributed to sports newspaper Diario AS. Biography De Miguel was born on 14 February 1980, in Calahorra, a town in the province of La Rioja. She was raised at her grandparents house in Autol because her mother and father worked continuously, and watched a wide variety of sports on television with her grandparents during her childhood. De Miguel was asked whether she wanted to pursue a career as a medicine doctor to which she replied she wanted to become a sports journalist. She did a degree in journalism in University of Bilbao, which she completed in 2002, and went on to complete a three-year internship at Radio Arnedo. De Miguel travelled to Madrid and passed the selection to become a sports reporter for Radio Nacional de Espa√±a (RNE). This marked the beginning of her professional career and she started working for the broadcaster in 2002. Over the next three years, De Miguel contributed to the sports programme Tablero Deportivo. Her contract with RNE expired in late 2005 and she received a telephone call from television channel Canal+ who were seeking a female sports reporter. De Miguel accepted the job because she did not want to return to Autol to ask her parents for money and also worked for a Madrid-based newspaper. She began working for Canal+ in November 2005, covering association football. De Miguel was present at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, and covered various football tournaments such as the UEFA Champions League and La Liga, the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa and UEFA Euro 2012. She also presented a daily tennis programme focused on the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, Canal+'s flagship late night sports programme El D√≠a del F√∫tbol analysing La Liga matches alongside various football players from 2009 to 2015, and the programme El d√≠a despu√©s. In late 2015, De Miguel considered changing jobs because she felt she was not progressing personally and professionally and wanted to be challenged. Broadcaster Movistar+ began seeking for a new presenter for its coverage of Formula One motor racing following its take over of the rights from Antena 3. She was confirmed as taking on the role as presenter in February 2016, replacing Antena 3's Luc√≠a Villal√≥n. De Miguel received some suspicion and criticism in online forums prior to the start of the season because of her background as an association football broadcaster. She found it not difficult to learn about Formula One jargon, and her first event was the 2016 Australian Grand Prix. In 2020, when Formula One was suspended by the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile and the series' promoter Liberty Media due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she began a Movistar+ programme called Parque cerrado to remain in contact with individuals in the championship. In her career, De Miguel has contributed to sports newspaper Diario AS, and in January 2020, she was made an ambassador of the University Soccer project to help Spanish football players obtain scholarships to allow them to play in American university leagues and study at them. Personal life She is against gender abuse and prefers to keep her private life out of the press. De Miguel spoke about equality and representation of women in the Spanish media to radio broadcaster Cadena SER for International Women's Day 2015. She says she prepares for each race by reading motorsport books and magazines as well as working with former drivers and mechanics to learn about their roles in the sport. To combat the stress of working in Formula One, she took up running to allow her to catch up with the sport and to allow her to adapt to different time zones.

The game is set to be released for Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S on February 25, 2021. Gameplay Riders Republic is an extreme sports game. The five main activities available in the game include mountain biking, skiing, snowboarding, wingsuit flying, and rocket wingsuiting. Ubisoft described the game as a \\"massively multiplayer sports game\\", as more than 50 players can compete against each other in races. The PS4 and Xbox One versions only support about 20 players. In addition, players can also play a 6v6 competitive multiplayer mode named \\"Tricks Battle Arena\\". In this mode, each team competes in an arena and needs to perform as many tricks as possible in order to score Trick points. The team which has the highest score would win the match. The game is set in an open world which meshes seven distinct American national parks, including Bryce Canyon, Yosemite Valley, Sequoia Park, Zion, Canyonlands, Mammoth Mountain, and Grand Teton, into one single map. It also features a social hub in which players can meet and interact with each other. The game also features a career mode, in which players engage in 6 different activities (Bike Freestyle, Bike Racing, Ski Freestyle, Ski Racing, Wingsuit, Rocket Wingsuit). Each of them has their own progression path. Gradually, players would reach important milestones, such as being invited to join competitions like UCI Mountain Bike World Cup, Red Bull Rampage and the X Games, and signing with real-world sports sponsors. The final objective is to participate in \\"Riders Ridge Invitational\\", \\"a never seen before multi-sport competition featuring all sports in one single event\\". In this event, players can switch between the sport activities at will. As players progress in the career mode, they will unlock new gears, outfits and cosmetic items. Development The game is currently being developed by Ubisoft Annecy, the team which released Steep, also an extreme sports game, in 2016. Development of the game started in 2017, and the development team expanded to include members from other Ubisoft's studios in Montpellier, Belgrade, Pune, Berlin, Kyiv, and Odesa. The development team recreated the national parks using GPS data, and even though the seven national parks are distinct regions in real life, the team integrated the parks together in order to create one single open world for players to explore. The American national parks were chosen as the game's setting as they are often used to host competitions for extreme sports. The studio also sent a team to visit these parks to ensure that they are accurately represented in the game. Like Steep, the game is not a simulation video game, as the team designed the gameplay to be as accessible as possible. The team worked with experts and athletes to ensure that each activity featured is authentic. For instance, different bike brands have stats that would \\"mimic real life behaviour\\". The gameplay was designed to be a social game which emphasizes \\"excitement and camaraderie of online community\\". This decision was made after Steep was offered as free game for PlayStation Plus members in early 2019, which went on to attract more than 10 million new players. Riders Republic was announced on September 10, 2020 during the Ubisoft Forward digital event. The game is set to be released for Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox One and Xbox Series X on February 25, 2021. Players who pre-ordered the game would receive the Bunny Pack, which adds additional cosmetic items into the game. The game would be supported extensively with post-launch downloadable content.

Plot An English tourist, sightseeing in Paris, wants to light his cigarette but does not have a match. He stops a passing coal deliverer and attempts to ask for a match, but cannot make himself understood. Rifling through all his pockets, the tourist finds one match, but it will not light, and another passerby also cannot help. Finally, the tourist splits himself into two identical Englishmen, one of whom lights the other's cigarette. The two doubles exit to have a drink together, linking arms and merging back into one man. Production and release M√©li√®s played both the English tourist and his double, with both seen in the same frame by means of multiple exposure. Every Man His Own Cigar Lighter was one of several M√©li√®s films featuring doubling, reflecting nineteenth-century Europe's fascination with the Doppelg√§nger; other such films include The Triple Lady (1898), The Triple Conjuror and the Living Head (1900), The Magic Lantern (1903), and Baron Munchausen's Dream (1911).

He was appointed to be Professor of Divinity and Principal of the Old College, St. Andrews by Cromwell's government. He was deposed after the Restoration under the influence of Archbishop Sharp in 1663. He was then holding Presbyterian principles at a time when Charles II was promoting Prelacy. He died in 1664. Life James Wood was the son of a merchant. He was educated at St Andrews. After study he became a Regent in the Old College there. He was ordained to the ministry of the church in 1640. He married Catherine Carstares on Thursday 7 January 1641 and therefore became the brother-in-law of John Carstares. James Wood was admitted minister of Dunino in 1641. In 1644, Wood was elected Professor of Divinity in Marischal College and minister of Greyfriars, Aberdeen, but not settled. He was then translated, in July 1645, to be professor of Ecclesiastical History in St Mary's or New College, St Andrews, of which Mr Samuel Rutherford was Principal. He was sent by the Assembly in 1650 to wait upon Charles II at Breda. The Treaty of Breda was signed by the king in 1650. He became Provost of St Salvator's College at the University of St Andrews in 1657. Wood, like Samuel Rutherford, had declined to become a Professor unless he were allowed to continue his work in the pulpit. Both were associated with Robert Blair and Andrew Honeyman in the ministry of St. Andrews. Their labours were unremitting. During the Commonwealth every minister was expected to preach three times a week, and to lecture and catechise once. According to Baillie, the differences between him and Rutherford on the subject of the Public Resolutions rendering his situation very uncomfortable, he was desirous of being removed, and, in 1657, was translated to be Principal of St Salvadors, or the old College of St Andrews. His appointment to this office by the University was owing to Cromwell's government, which, by the advice of James, afterwards Archbishop Sharp, wrote a letter to the ministers of St Andrews, and the masters of the University, requiring them to admit Wood as Principal of the Old College without delay. Baillie in recording this appointment says, \\"I am glad he is in it, or any other 'charge' where he is contented; for indeed he is the most serviceable man our church now has.\\" On the establishment of Prelacy after the restoration of Charles II., Sharp did all he could to induce Wood to conform; and finding his efforts utterly ineffectual, he soon effected his removal from St Andrews. By his instigation Wood was summoned before the Privy Council in July 1663; and appearing, his place was declared vacant, while he was ordered to confine himself within the city of Edinburgh. He was, however, afterwards permitted to return to St Andrews to visit his father who had fallen sick. He died about the beginning of the year 1664. Sharp visited him once or twice on his death- bed in St Andrews; and, though Wood spoke very little to him, and never at all about the introduced ecclesiastical changes, he circulated a report, that, in the prospect of eternity, Wood professed an entire indifference as to the subject of Church government, and that it might be altered according to the will of the magistrate. Wood, deeply grieved on hearing this report, dictated and subscribed a solemn testimony, before two witnesses and a notary, in which he declares it as his dying conviction, that Presbyterian government was the ordinance of God, appointed by Jesus Christ for governing and ordering his visible Church. Death James Wood died on 15 March 1664, aged about 55.

Life Sturge was born in Elberton in Gloucestershire in 1795. She became an invalid, a victim, she said \\"of disease and medicine\\". She was the fifth child in the family of twelve of Joseph Sturge, a farmer in Elberton, Gloucestershire, and his wife Mary Marshall, who belonged to the Religious Society of Friends (commonly known as Quakers). Her brothers included John Sturge, who became a manufacturer in Birmingham, and Edmund Sturge. The abolitionist Joseph Sturge was her elder brother and Charles Gilpin was a nephew. She and her siblings were taught by tutors but their mother had to decide what could be afforded and Sophia's requests for drawing and French had to be refused. However the children taught themselves by correspondence. Sophia read well and would discuss ideas by letter. She attended a school in Wellington, but did not enjoy it. In 1815 she became her brother, Joseph Sturge's, housekeeper in Edgbaston while he was in business with his brother Charles. In fact she joined the business for a time as their bookkeeper. She idolised her brother Joseph as he became one of the pre- eminent abolitionists. That world was on hold when he married Eliza Cropper in 1834 and she went off to be a governess. She returned the following year when Eliza died and she would remain at his house as his personal assistant and adviser. The big debate of the time was not just when, but how, to end slavery. Many argued that it should be phased out, but Sophia and Joseph wanted it to end quickly and completely. Sophia founded the Birmingham Ladies Society for the Relief of Negro Slaves which although based in Birmingham, had national influence. She called on 3,000 households to ask for their support is boycotting sugar because of its links to slavery. Death and legacy Sturge died in Edgbaston in 1845. She was cared for during her final illness by her brother, Joseph. Her idolised brother married again the following year and his first child was named Sophia Sturge. She would be a leading peace campaigner.

The 2020 Brazil rainforest wildfires are a series of forest fires that are affecting Brazil, with 44,013 outbreaks of fires registered between January and August in the Amazonas and Pantanal. Within the Amazon, 6,315 outbreaks of fire were detected in the same period. Within the Pantanal, the volume of fires is equivalent to those of the past six years and there have been actions by NGOs and volunteers to save endangered animals, such as the jaguar. It is expected that the health systems of the Amazon region, already overloaded by the COVID-19 pandemic, will be even more overloaded due to respiratory diseases due to smoke. Expertise carried out points out that the fires in the Pantanal were started by human action and the Environmental Police Station investigates who are possibly responsible. Douglas Morton, head of NASA's Biospheric Sciences Laboratory, considers fires to be \\"unprecedented\\". Although the Brazilian government has instituted a 120-day ban on burning in the Amazon, an analysis led by NASA indicates that this was of little effect. Between May 28 and August 25, 516 fire points were detected covering an area of 376,416 hectares. In August, President Jair Bolsonaro's response was that \\"the media and foreign governments are presenting a false narrative about the Amazon\\". The same month Brazil's National Institute for Space Research reported that satellite data shows that the number of fires in the Amazon increased by 28% to ~6,800 fires in July compared to the ~5,300 wildfires in July 2019. This indicated a, potentially worsened, repeat of 2019's accelerated destruction of one of the world's largest protectable buffers against global warming in 2020. Satellites in September recorded 32,017 hotspots in the world‚Äôs largest rainforest, a 61% rise from the same month in 2019. In the Pantanal, part of the fire started in private areas or legal reserves (which is protected by law) and spread to indigenous territories.

The work is a portrait, painted in pointillist style, of Irma S√®the, one of the heiress of a musical Brussels family close to the painter, playing the violin. The work is now in the private collection of the Mus√©e du Petit Palais in Geneva. Context In 1884 Van Rysselberghe was one of the founders of the avant-garde society of Les XX. Members of the group initially focused on Impressionism, but under the influence of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, several of its members moved on, with many of them embracing Seurat's Pointillism. While Van Rysselberghe was not the first member of Les XX to produce work based on the guidelines set by Seurat, he nevertheless ended up with being to most committed to the latter, sticking with divisionism for the rest of his career. Today, Van Rysselberghe is considered one of the greatest Neo-Impressionists of the 19th century. Van Rysselberghe had previously mainly studied the old masters in search of solutions for the representation of light effects. He found a suitable solution after his acquaintance with Seurat, in the technique of the Divisionists. In his Mademoiselle Alice S√®the (1888) Van Rysselbergeh combined avant-garde technique with the Dutch realist approach. In that painting, he makes evident both the financial status of the S√®the and their passion for music. In Portrait of Irma S√®the (who was Alice's sister) Van Rysselberghe cemented his newly discovered style. Painting Detail of unidentified individual The S√®the family from Brussels belonged to Van Rysselberghe's circle of friends. Van Rysselberghe portrayed the S√®the daughters, Irma, Maria (the wife of Henry Van de Velde) and Alice (wife of sculptor Paul Dubois ) on several occasions. Portrait of Irma S√®the depicts Irma playing the violin. Making music played an important role in the S√®the family. Maria played the harmonium and Irma was apprenticed to the \\"King of Violin\\" Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, a violinist and teacher at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. Van Rysselberghe portrayed Irma S√®the completely immersed in playing the violin. Attention is focused on her. However, Irma is not alone: in the room next to her there sits another woman. The depiction of this second, partly concealed figure gives the painting some tension. It begs the question of who she is, what is she doing, and why is she behind the door. The Portrait of Irma S√®the typifies Van Rysselberghe's pointillism. The satin of Irma's dress lights up in full pink, composed of thousands of dots of unmixed colors. The changing light and color effects create a strong plastic effect over the folds on Irma's sleeves and skirt. Van Rysselberghe made a great impression on his fellow painters with his Portrait of Irma S√®the, especially on Paul Signac, who described it in his diary as \\"extraordinarily delicate.\\" The portrait was exhibited in 1895 at the Paris Salon des Ind√©pendants, in 1898 at the salon of La Libre Esth√©tique, and in 1899 at the thirteenth exhibition of the Vienna Secession. It established Van Rysselberghe's name in Europe as a prominent pointillist painter. Van Rysselberghe was one of the few pointillists who primarily focused on portraiture. While many of his Belgian colleagues later switched to fauvism, he remained faithful to his divisionist technique.

Having gone through a number of lineup changes earlier in their career, the band currently consists of three Danes, Asger Mygind (vocals and guitars), Martin Werner (keyboards) and Nicolai Mogensen (bass guitars); and one Swede, Adam Janzi (drums).  History  = Origins (2006‚Äì2012) = The band was formed by vocalist and guitarist Asger Mygind and some friends, and coalesced into a stable lineup in 2006. The band self-released their first EP, Homesick Machinery, in 2008, which featured Mygind, guitarist Niels Dreijer, bassist Jeppe Bloch, Martin Werner on keyboards and Niklas Scherfig on drums. A single, \\"Glasswork\\", was also released on 22 March 2010. After the first EP, there were some lineup changes, with Bloch and Scherfig replaced by Nicolai Mogensen and Felix Ewert, respectively. The new lineup recorded a second EP, Monsters, which was self-released by the band in 2011. This EP consists of four tracks characterised by a mix of progressive rock and djent styles, the latter of which was produced thanks to the use of seven-string guitars. The band went on a short five-date tour of their home country to promote the EP, after which Dreijer left the band, leaving them as a four-piece, with Mygind taking over sole responsibility for vocals and guitars, and Mogensen handling backing vocals when they play live. = Inmazes (2015‚Äì2017) = On 2 February 2015 VOLA self-released their first album Inmazes. A video was released for the first single, \\"Gutter Moon\\" in August 2016, the band having previously released a lyric video for \\"Starburn\\". The album was later given a physical release on 16 September 2016 by Mascot Label Group. According to Mygind the lyrical themes on Inmazes relate to entrapment: On 2 June 2017, the band released their October Session EP, featuring new acoustic versions of two songs from Inmazes (\\"Gutter Moon\\" and \\"Stray the Skies\\"), with a video being produced for the latter. To promote Inmazes, the band embarked on a European tour for the first time, supporting Katatonia on their Fallen Hearts Over Europe tour, alongside the Icelandic band Agent Fresco. Drummer Ewert was busy with other commitments and was therefore unable to take part in the tour, so the band hired Simen Sandnes from the band Arkentype as a temporary replacement. It was subsequently announced on 22 August 2017 that Ewert had amicably left the band on a permanent basis, to focus on other projects. His replacement was revealed to be the Swedish drummer Adam Janzi, who had previously played with The Drake Equation. = Applause of a Distant Crowd (2018‚Äì2019) = Frontman Asger Mygind live in Parma in 2019 VOLA's second album, Applause of a Distant Crowd, was released on 12 October 2018, and was considered something of a departure from Inmazes, with less emphasis on the heaviness of the first album, and greater use of electronics, a process defined as \\"natural\\" by Asger Mygind: In anticipation of the album's release, VOLA released videos between August and October 2018 for \\"Smartfriend\\", \\"Ghosts\\" and \\"Alien Shivers\\". The band were special guests on Monuments' European tour during October and November 2018. On 11 January 2019, the band released a lyric video for \\"Whaler\\" and were announced as the support act for Haken on their European tour throughout February and March. At the end of May 2019 a video was released for \\"Ruby Pool\\", the fourth track on the album. During September 2019 VOLA embarked on their first headlining tour, supported by Arch Echo and Rendezvous Point. = Upcoming third album (2020‚Äìpresent) = During the second half of 2019, Mygind discussed the band's plans to begin recording their third album in early 2020. It is expected to be heavier than Applause of a Distant Crowd. On 21 August 2020 the band announced that they had finished recording their third album, which was in the process of being mixed.  Musical style and influences  On their first album Inmazes, VOLA combined the typical sounds of progressive metal and electronic music, creating songs with odd time signatures, complex riffs and catchy and melodic choruses, with the cover banner drawing comparisons to Pink Floyd, Rammstein and Meshuggah. As explained by Mygind, even the name of the band (which was chosen by previous bassist Jeppe Bloch) reflects their sound in that they \\"try to do [their] choruses very majestic and grandios [sic]\\". With the release of their second album Applause of a Distant Crowd, the band expanded their musical palette to incorporate a more progressive rock sound and a greater use of electronics, with progressive metal essentially limited to the songs \\"Smartfriend\\" and \\"Whaler\\".

A proud Leither, many of his songs relate to his upbringing in the area, including Man From Leith. Owens‚Äô first serious band was Smile, formed with bass player Kevin McGuire, guitarist Calais Brown and drummer Dave Stewart around 1991/92. Their first single ‚Äì Obvious ‚Äì released on Different Class Records, reached no 20 in the Scottish Charts in 1992. His next band, The Felsons, rose from the ashes of Smile. Built round the core of Owens and McGuire, developing their signature ‚ÄúCeltabilly‚Äù/americana sound, they released their first album - One Step Ahead Of The Posse - in 1996, followed up with a mini album, Lasso The Moon. They were then joined by Smile guitarist Calais Brown and released their third album Glad on G2, a subsidiary of Scottish label Greentrax. The Felsons toured widely in UK, including a tour as support for US band, The Mavericks, before Owens started working on his solo career, including tours in USA, Europe and Australia. Owens has released seven official solo studio albums since 2001, mostly recorded in USA, including his two most recent (Into The Sea (2015) and Southern Wind (2018)) which were recorded in Nashville with Grammy nominated, award winning producer Neilson Hubbard. Reviews (from both sides of the Atlantic), were very positive, and highlighted a \\"unique Scottish, americana blend\\" in his music. A ‚ÄúBest of‚Äù album ‚Äì The Man From Leith (with sleeve notes by Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh) - was released in March 2020 on London‚Äôs Eel Pie Records, also to very positive reviews. His next album, Sinner‚Äôs Shrine, recorded in Tucson, Arizona, with members of ‚Äúdesert noir‚Äù band, Calexico, is scheduled for release in 2021. Owens also tours occasionally with Scottish fiddle player Amy Geddes, under the name of Redwood Mountain, with lyrics taken from Alan Lomax‚Äôs The Book of American Folk Songs, reimagined with new melodies. A self titled album was released in 2017. In March 2020 Owens curated the inaugural Cash Back in Fife Festival, which celebrated the legacy of Johnny Cash, and his family connections to Fife.

After closing as a railway station, it was sold in 1969 and operated as a steak house from 1970 until it closed in 2007. Historical Information Postcard showing the station circa 1911. We can see the Watreous manufacturing plant to the left. The current building was the third structure built by the railway at the site. A building permit was issued in 1899 to erect a frame shed on the east side of the site, north of Erie Avenue, for a value of $400. Another permit was issued in 1900 to erect a frame shed on the east side of Lot 19 for a value of $1,000. Finally, a permit for a new brick station was issued in 1906, for the east side of Lots 19-20, for a value of $6,500. The 1.5 storey red brick structure in built in the Queen Anne Revival style. Per the City of Brantford: \\"Features such as the round conical corner tower, bay windows; large round arches on the west facade are indicative of this style. The base course is a rock-faced coursed range of limestone. Some unusual features are the wooden timber brackets with a circle inside a capital \\"A\\" shape resting on a stone corbel. The brickwork of the lintel course (alternating recessed soldier course between two single stretcher courses) suggests a train track pattern. This feature is similar to what is seen on the west facade of the Brantford Armouries.‚Äù A notable feature of the building is a large stone sill of the left bay dormer that has \\"1896\\" engraved in it. A 1906 addition to the building generally replicated the features of the original structure. The station sits on a 27,045 square foot lot, with around 90 feet of street frontage. A number of local industries built manufacturing plants along the railway line including the Waterous Engine Works, the Cockshutt Plow Company, Goold, Shapley and Muir and Slingsby‚Äôs. This rail connection allowed for products manufactured in the city to be exported to the United States and other countries around the world. The building was sold in 1969 and operated as the Iron Horse steakhouse until 2007, when the restaurant closed. The building has sat vacant since the restaurant closed. In 2019, the City looked at adding an historical designation to the structure; ‚ÄúThe intended designation would only include the 1896 structure and the 1906 addition to the railway station and not later modifications, said Nathan Etherington, chair of the heritage committee. The designation would be a proactive step to minimize any further damage to the exterior of building, including some flaking of the limestone at the base of the structure and some mortar work.‚Äù References Category:Buildings and structures in Brantford ","title":"Brantford (TH&amp;B) railway station"},{"id":"65304491","text":"The 2003‚Äì04 Divizia D Bihor was the 36th season of the Liga IV Bihor, the fourth tier of the Romanian football league system.

His historical writing includes Bringing It All Back Home (2006), a report published by the Chartered Institute of Housing, lamenting the decline of the Romsey neighbourhood of Cambridge, and his many contributions as a founder member of the Mill Road History Project, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund in 2013. In recognition of his work as tour guide and local historian in the City of Cambridge, Brigham was awarded the Honorary Degree of Master of Arts on 18 July 2009 by the University of Cambridge. Biography Brigham was born in 1951, in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, the son of Michael Brigham, an accountant, and his wife, Helen Hine, a physiotherapist. He was educated at the Leys School, Cambridge. He then studied history and politics at University of Sheffield, graduating in 1973. At Sheffield he was taught by political theorist Bernard Crick and was a contemporary of politician David Blunkett. Brigham moved to Cambridge but could only get a job as a road sweeper. \\"Roadsweeping was the only job I could get when I moved here. It was meant to be a temporary job but I have just continued doing it. I had planned to be a teacher.\\" He joined the GMB union. For a time he lived in a \\"virtual squat\\", a house sublet by computer pioneer Christopher Curry, co-founder of Acorn Computers. He became a Blue Badge tourist guide, and devoted his energies to inspiring the locals of Cambridge about their city, from his personal perspective. The \\"Town NOT Gown\\" Tours were walking tours around different parts of Cambridge. His website included the quotation: \\"What an eye opener! We have seen so many things we never noticed before. We can truly say that Allan brought our city to life for us with his knowledge and his enthusiasm. A great guide!\\" His brother wrote: \\"Allan was a great communicator and listener, and for him debate and discussion were vital. He used his guided tours to discuss wider issues.\\" Brigham was a trustee and Chair of the Friends of the Museum of Cambridge for 30 years. He was a founding member of the Mill Road History Society. In 2017, Brigham was quoted in a Guardian report about the CB1 development near Cambridge railway station. Condemning the work of architect Richard Rogers, Allan said, \\"We were all taken in by the name Richard Rogers, but now it seems they were just using his name as a fig leaf. This was a chance to make a gateway to the city that we could all be proud of. But they've blown it.\\" Writing Brigham contributed to Society and Public Voices in The Guardian. The Brigham family moved to Surrey when Allan was still young. He published a study of 19th-century Dorking as Urban Growth in a Surrey Market Town (1988). He co-authored the 1996 book Cambridge Iron Founders, published by the Cambridge Industrial Archaeology Society. =Bringing It All Back Home= In November 2006, his report Bringing It All Back Home, co-authored with Colin Wiles, was launched at a conference of the Chartered Institute of Housing Eastern Region, four decades on from the groundbreaking TV drama Cathy Come Home. The Guardian reported the launch under the headline \\"Death of a Neighbourhood\\" and described how Brigham \\"charts the decline of Romsey in the 1970s and its gentrification with the arrival of the first wave of educated, middle-class public sector workers a decade later, attracted by the character of the tiny brick houses, their affordability and sense of community.\\" =Mill Road History Project= In May 2013, the Mill Road History Project received a grant of ¬£99,248 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund for a two-year project to document the history of Mill Road as a tribute to the area's significance in the history of the whole city. Founding members of the team were Lucy Walker, Ian Bent, Melissa McGreechan, Tamsin Wimhurst, Caro Wilson, Allan Brigham, and Sarah Tovell. In October 2013, the Cambridge News pictured Brigham alongside other founder members, at the launch of the Mill Road History Project at Ditchburn Place. Allan said \\"Mill Road has recently been described as ‚Äòthe new Islington‚Äô; others still remember it as the route to the Workhouse. The Mill Road History Project hopes to capture memories of people who have lived here all their lives and the stories of those who come here from all over the world. Adapting to change is what Mill Road is all about.\\" The website of the Mill Road History Society includes a list of his selected writing: * Allan Brigham (2006).

The company was founded in 1989 by Missy Park who was an early beneficiary of Title IX, playing basketball at Yale University. Park, born in 1962, was the first generation of young women to go through high school and college after Title IX had passed. She had to play most of her college career in men's shorts and basketball shoes which were uncomfortable and didn't fit right. She decided to start a place where women could find workout gear that was comfortable. Title Nine began as a mail order company in the Bay Area. It is run by female executives and largely staffed by female athletes. The models in their catalogs are primarily actual female athletes. While the site is known for their sports bras, they also sell athletic equipment such as hockey gear, batting helmets and bicycles that are made for women and girls. The company was profitable for the first time in 1993 and launched their first website in 1995. Title Nine helped produce Dandelion, an outdoors women's magazine and sponsors local activity groups and running races.

Background In The New Baronetage of England, Miller names Sir William Milman as a member of the Milman family of Levaton- in-Woodland, Devon, who, by 1804, \\"were long settled at Holderness, in Yorkshire, and at Chelsea, Middlesex.\\" He claims the family to be descended from Johannes de Malamanus, a Norman officer sent by William the Conqueror to quell Hereward's 1070 rebellion on the Isle of Ely.Miller, William, and Edmund Lloyd. The New Baronetage of England. Vol. 2, London, 1804, pp. 923. Malamanus is included by Robert Orford in his list of Norman officers who participated in the siege of Ely Abbey, as an ensign of the foot.Croft, John, compiler. Excerpta Antiqua; Or, a Collection of Original Manuscripts. York, William Blanchard, 1796, pp. 4. The appellation 'Malamanus,' or 'bad-hand,' is derived from Johannes' alleged left-handedness. This is the origin of the Milman coat of arms; three sinister gauntlets.Miller, The New Baronetage of England, 1804, pp. 923. Johannes de Malamanus is depicted on the 1596 Tabula Eliensis alongside Otto the Benedictine, in the section of the painting that portrays the \\"forty knights and gentlemen who were quartered with the monks of Ely during the reign of William the Conqueror.\\"http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/135719 Both William Miller, in The New Baronetage of England, and John Wilkes, in Encyclopaedia Londinensis, associate Sir William Milman with the Milman Baronets of Levaton-in-Woodland.Wilkes, John.

His parents were William Milman and Mary Palmer. According to Le Neve's Pedigree of Knights, William Milman the elder worked as a shoemaker at the New Exchange in the Strand, but failed in business and later ran a coffeehouse.Le Neve, Le Neve's Pedigrees of the Knights, p. 492. Milman made his fortune in stock-jobbing. For most of his life, he was a barrister with the London Inns.Hibbert, Christopher, et al. The London Encyclopaedia. Macmillan, 2008, p. 553. Such was his prolificacy in his field, he became acquainted with the Earl of Dorset, godfather of Prince William. The Earl of Dorset introduced Milman to Prince William's mother, Queen Anne, and Milman was knighted on the 7th of February, 1705, at St James's Palace.Townsend, Francis. A Catalogue of Knights: From 1660 to 1760. Kessinger Publishing, 2010, p. 48. Sir William Milman was married three times in his life. His first wife was Elizabeth Taylor, daughter of Col. Silvanus Taylor, and niece of Silas Taylor. William and Elizabeth had two children, both of whom died in infancy. One of their children, Ann Milman, was born in 1677. William later married Laetitia Masters, widow of Samuel Masters, preacher at Bridewell Hospital, and daughter of William Durham, rector of St Mildred, Bread Street.Pincus, Stephen C. A. 1688: The First Modern Revolution. Yale UP, 2009, p. 159. The couple bore no children, and Laetitia was buried at St Mildred's on the 2nd of November, 1702. Milman's third and final wife was Elizabeth Vaughan, daughter of Mr. Vaughan of Wales. The couple also bore no children.Le Neve, Le Neve's Pedigrees of the Knights, p. 492. Sir William died on the 3rd of February, 1713. He left no issue, and his fortune of ¬£20,000 was left chiefly to his nieces; daughters of his brother John Milman, who \\"lived a poor man to whom his brother [Sir William] would not exhibit.\\"Le Neve, Le Neve's Pedigrees of the Knights, p. 492. His nieces, Elizabeth, Robella, Mary, and Diana, were bequeathed quarter-shares of Sir William's estate, on the condition they and their heirs retained the surname Milman. He was also survived by his mother, Mary Milman, and widow, Dame Elizabeth Milman, n√©e Vaughan. His mother was left the house she lived in, and an annuity of ¬£100 per year. His widow, Lady Elizabeth, was executrix of his will and was left an annuity of ¬£600 per year, as long as she remained unmarried after the death of Sir William. Milman was buried at More's Chapel, Chelsea. The chapel, originally the private property of Thomas Moore, came into the ownership of Sir William Milman on his acquisition of Gorges House. His tombstone, inscribed with his arms, reads: \\"Here Lyeth The Body of Sr WILLIAM MILMAN Kr Barister at Law of the Inner Temple LONDON who Died at his House in CHELSEA Febry ye 3d in the 64th Year of his Age Annoque Dom 1713.\\" Legacy Following his death, Sir William Milman was remembered in the name of Milman House, his former estate. Originally Gorges House, the estate belonged to Sir Arthur Gorges, and was purchased by Sir William from dancing-master Josias Priest. Milman likely mortgaged the property from Priest between 1697 and 1706, before taking ownership by 1711.Thorp, Jennifer. \\"Dance in Late 17th-Century London: Priestly Muddles.\\" Early Music, vol. 26, no. 2, May 1998, pp. 205. After Sir William's death, Milman House passed to his four nieces. By 1726 the property had been demolished, and his remaining nieces leased the land for the construction of \\"a new row of buildings intended to be called Milman's Row.\\" Milman's Street remains testament to Sir William Milman's involvement in the area today. A key source of information on the life of Sir William Milman is Le Neve's Pedigree of Knights, written by Peter Le Neve. The author gained his account of Milman from a Mr. Mynheer of Staple Inn, an \\"attorney who was his old acquaintance and fellow clerk with him.\\" Mynheer was scathing in his appraisal of Milman, calling him \\"no gentleman\\" and \\"a worthless person by the general character of him.\\"Le Neve, Le Neve's Pedigrees of the Knights, p. 492. Le Neve finishes by quoting the assassins of Maximinus I and his children; \\"canis pessimi ne catulum esse relinquendum,\\" that no child be left alive to a heretic parent.Lykosthenes, Konrad.

It is an adaptation of Booker Prize winner J.G. Farrell‚Äôs 1978 novel, The Singapore Grip. It stars Luke Treadaway, David Morrissey and Elizabeth Tan. The series debut was on BBC First in Australia on 26 July 2020, followed by 13 September on UK's ITV. Synopsis The story is about a British family, the Blacketts, who control one of the leading trading companies in colonial-era Singapore. Walter Blackett is keen that Matthew Webb, the son of his business partner, should marry his daughter Joan, but Matthew is interested instead in a mysterious Chinese woman, Vera Chiang. The events take place in the background of the Japanese invasion and occupation of Singapore. A running joke in the story is Matthew trying to find out what \\"the Singapore Grip\\" means, and getting different answers from different people he talked to. Cast * Charles Dance as Mr.Webb * Luke Treadaway as Matthew Webb * David Morrissey as Walter Blackett * Georgia Blizzard as Joan Blackett * Jane Horrocks as Sylvia Blackett * Lilo Baier as Kate Blackett * Luke Newberry as Monty Blackett * Colm Meaney as Major Brendan Archer * Elizabeth Tan as Vera Chiang * Bart Edwards as Ehrendorf * Christophe Guybet as Dupigny Production Carcosa Seri Negara, a film location ITV commissioned the production of an adaptation of the J. G. Farrell book, The Singapore Grip, in February 2018. The production company Mammoth Screen approached Christopher Hampton to write the screenplay. Hampton, who knew Farrell very well before he died in 1979, readily agreed. The series was executive produced by Damien Timmer, and filming began in early 2019. The series was filmed in various locations in and around Kuala Lumpur and Penang in Malaysia rather than in Singapore which has become too well-developed to reflect the look and feel of the colonial era. The mansions of Carcosa Seri Negara in Perdana Botanical Gardens in Kuala Lumpur served as the residences of the Blacketts and Mr Webb. A vintage plane from a museum in a military airbase was used for the arrival of Matthew Webb, and an abandoned town near Kuala Lumpur airport was used for the firefighting scene. The Battle of Slim River was also filmed near Kuala Lumpur, as was the plantation scene filmed at Broga Plantation. Other locations that doubled for old Singapore included the Royal Selangor Club and Wisma Ekran (Anglo-Oriental Building) in Kuala Lumpur, Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Klang, as well as Georgetown's Chinatown, City Hall, cricket ground and Esplanade, Swettenham Pier, the Lebuh Aceh Mosque Compound, the Thai Pak Koong Temple, and Balik Pulau Rice Field in Penang. Episodes STV Player uploaded all six episodes at once as a boxset on 13 September 2020, whereas the ITV Hub is only uploading one episode at a time after broadcast every Sunday, from 13 September-18 October 2020  Critical reception  The Guardian gave it two stars, and called the satire 'bite-free', saying the humour was 'oddly pitched' and 'cast between two poles, neither vicious nor silly enough to make sense of telling yet another colonial story from an almost entirely white perspective'.https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/13/the- singapore-grip-review-bite-free-satire-revels-in-colonial-cliche The Independent also gave the series two stars, criticizing the tone and stating, 'It can‚Äôt decide how sharp to be, veering between a Catch-22-style black comedy about the horrors of war and a jolly-old-marriage farce, complete with a relentless big band soundtrack.'https://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/tv/reviews/singapore-grip-review-itv-drama-controversy-cast- plot-b421966.html Anita Singh of The Daily Telegraph rated it better at three stars, but still considered it lacking the bite of the book. She thought the drama appeared rather \\"more akin to a cosy Jeeves and Wooster-style comedy\\"; the \\"cosiness is deliberate ‚Äì the invasion will come as a rude awakening ‚Äì but what worked on the page does not transfer easily to the screen. It ends up looking like any other jolly ITV drama.\\" James Delingpole of The Spectator was more positive, describing the cast as \\"splendid, the colonial setting lavishly realised... This is the Sunday night TV many of us feared they‚Äôd never dare make any more. =Controversy= The advocacy group British East and South East Asians working in the Theatre and Screen industries criticised the series as \\"colonial history told through a white gaze\\", whose \\"Asian characters are merely heavily accented ciphers, silent chauffeurs, exotic dancers, giggly prostitutes, monosyllabic grunts and half-naked Yogis\\". Screenwriter Christopher Hampton defended the books on which the series is based as \\"perhaps the most celebrated attack on colonialism by a British novelist in the 20th Century\\".
