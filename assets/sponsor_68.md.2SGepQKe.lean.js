He came from a poor family but obtained a good technical education and joined the iron maker as an employee in 1874. He rose rapidly through the ranks, and started to acquire shares. Soon after taking charge of the company he became the largest shareholder. He quadrupled production in the years leading up to World War I (1914‚Äì18). The company was devastated by the war, but Cavallier managed to bring production back up to prewar levels before his death. Early years Camille Constant Cavallier was born on 19 May 1854 in Pont-√†-Mousson, then in the Meurthe department. His parents were Jean Pierre Baptiste Cavallier (b. 1816) and Marguerite Sophie Martin (b. 1825). His father was a gamekeeper for the Eaux et For√™ts and his mother was a cleaning lady whose customers included Xavier Rog√©, head of the local Soci√©t√© de Pont-√†-Mousson iron works. His sister Sophie later joined the S≈ìurs de la Charit√© de Saint Charles, and his brother Henri became a member of the board of directors of the Soci√©t√© de Pont-√†-Mousson. For many years the family lived in the heart of the Bois-le- Pr√™tre, a forest about from the center of the town. In October 1867 Camille was admitted as a day student to the Coll√®ge of Pont-√†-Mousson, where he was an excellent student. In 1870 he was accepted by the √âcole Nationale des Arts et M√©tiers in Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne. His education was interrupted by the Franco- Prussian War of 1870. He returned to the college for a few months after it reopened in the spring of 1871, then entered the √âcole des Arts et M√©tiers in Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne on 15 October 1871. He graduated on 31 July 1874 as a medalist. Marbache The Pont-√†-Mousson company had been created in 1856 by a group of Lorraine businessmen to operate the Marbache iron mine and to use the ore to manufacture cast iron. Xavier Rog√© was the manager. In 1862 the enterprise was liquidated due to lack of sufficient capital to cover the high investment expenses. Rog√© managed to raise capital in the Saarland and restart the business, selling most of its production to forges in the Ardennes and Champagne. In 1866 Rog√© visited England and became aware of the new and promising market for cast-iron water pipes. He focused the company on pipe production, and found a ready market when cities began to make large investment in water supply after 1871. He adopted the English method of casting pipes in vertical rather than horizontal moulds. Camille Cavallier joined the Soci√©t√© de Pont-√†-Mousson on 1 August 1874. At this time the company consisted only of the factory at Pont-√†-Mousson and the Marbache Iron Mine in the Nancy Basin. The blast furnaces produced only 50,000 tons per year, of which only 12,000 tons were made into moulded products, mainly cast iron pipes. Cavallier worked at the company for four months before being called up on 5 November 1874 for a year of military service, which he spent at Versailles in the 1st Regiment of Engineers. He was discharged as a second lieutenant of the reserve on 1 November 1875. He returned to the Soci√©t√© de Pont-√†-Mousson on 2 November 1875, where he would work for the rest of his life. Growing responsibility (1875‚Äì99) Camille Cavallier was first assigned to the \\"flat\\" foundry, then in 1876 to the \\"standing\\" foundry dedicated to making iron gutters and pipes. In 1877 Rog√© gave him charge of the newly created commercial service. The job was to establish regional agencies, monitor demand, watch competitors and draw up quotations for tenders. He achieved excellent results in selling the cast iron pipes, and in 1883 won the tenders for the city of Paris. Rog√© decided to groom Cavallier as his successor, and in the 1880s Cavallier became in effect the director- general, although Rog√© retained that title. Cavallier did not limit himself to the commercial side, but played a large role in building up the company's mining assets. The company depended on the Marbache and Custines mines in the Nancy Basin, which delivered about 100,000 tons of ore annually. After surveys of the Millery region the company asked for a mining concession there, but was refused. Factory at Pont-√†-Mousson Xavier Rog√© began to investigate land around Aubou√© near the part of Lorraine that had been annexed by Germany, and on 1 December 1882 found the upper layers of the iron oxide formation of the Briey Basin. The survey then stopped, since the company undertaking it declared that the iron oxide formation had been completely crossed. Cavallier thought there could be lower layers, and obtained permission to continue the survey. In April 1883 a layer thick was found, and on 11 August 1884 the Soci√©t√© de Pont-√†-Mousson was granted the concession. The technicians said that it would be very difficult to pass through the overburden above the Aubou√© ore deposit due to the amount of water it contained. Cavallier decided to proceed anyway, using the freezing method to pass through the aquifer layer, although this method had not been used for more than in the past. The gamble succeeded. The Pont-√†-Mousson ironworks was transformed into a societe anonyme in 1886, with Xavier Rog√© as its sole administrator. Rog√© fell seriously ill in 1888 and depended more and more on Cavallier, then aged 34. On 17 August 1888 the company was granted the Vieux-Ch√¢teau concession, and on 25 May 1892 was granted the Belleville concession, both in the Nancy Basin. The company acquired the Malz√©ville and Grande Goutte mines in the Nancy Basin. In the 1890s the blast furnaces were fitted with Cowper regenerative heat exchangers. Until 1889 Cavallier had no shares in the company. In 1890 he acquired 100 shares, and in 1898 another 136. When Rog√© was sick Cavallier acted as the effective head of the company, and on 15 January 1895 he was named deputy director. About 1878 Camille Cavallier married Th√©r√®se Julie Mangeot (). Their children were Charles (1879‚Äì1930) and Jeanne Marguerite Fran√ßoise (b. ). Around 1908 his daughter married Marcel Paul (1879‚Äì1946), who changed his name to Marcel Paul-Cavallier. Camille Cavallier meeting union leaders in 1908 Chief executive: Pre-war period (1899‚Äì1914) On 31 January 1899 Camille Cavallier was made joint administrator, and became sole administrator when Rog√© retired the next year. On 31 March 1899 Cavallier obtained the Mairy concession in the Briey Basin for the company. Since becoming head of the company Cavallier devoted a large part of his salary to buying shares in the company. In 1900, Cavallier held only 8% of the capital of Pont-√†-Mousson, with 236 shares. By the time of the meeting of 9 January 1901 he had become the largest shareholder with 816 shares, or 28%, due to acquisition of the shares of Xavier Rog√©. By 1912 he controlled 36.8%, including the shares of his family members. By 1910 Cavallier was worth 10 million gold francs, a large but not huge amount. After World War I he controlled 43% of the company's capital. His motivation seems to have been primarily to build up the enterprise through hard work rather than to make a personal fortune. Cavallier built his house beside the factory on the Nancy‚ÄìMetz road so that he could be \\"in the middle of his hive.\\" He would work long hours, from 6 in the morning until late at night. A general strike started at Pont-√†-Mousson in September 1905, the first, triggered by dismissal of the union's treasurer but caused by long-running grievances over pay. The strike was a shock to the management. Cavallier founded the F√™te du travail (Labour Festival) in 1906 in an attempt to reunite the community. In 1910 the steelmaker Fran√ßois de Wendel ran for election as deputy in Briey, opposed by a local physician who was supported by the F√©d√©ration r√©publicaine. He lost by 3,506 votes to the doctor's 3,820. Wendel was convinced, perhaps correctly, that Cavallier had engineered his defeat since he distrusted Wendel's dealings with union leaders and thought he had encouraged the strike . Unlike self-made men such as Cavallier and Alexandre Dreux of the Aci√©ries de Longwy, Wendel was aristocratic, which did not endear him with the other industrialists. Exploratory drilling shaft for coal built in 1905 by the Soci√©t√© Joseph Vogt for the Soci√©t√© des Fonderies de Pont-√†-Mousson Cavallier transformed the moderately sized cast iron pipe manufacturer into a giant, always concentrating on making pipes. Annual cast iron production rose from 80,000 to 183,000 tons between 1900 and 1913. Cavallier studied use of blast furnace gas for production of electrical power, built a test station, then built a large central power station. He continued to increase the percent of pipes in the company output. In 1903 he installed blast furnaces at Aubou√©. In 1905 he built a foundry at Foug, throwing up the building and furnaces in a month. In 1905 Cavallier purchased the Moineville concession, which was later merged with the Aubou√© concession. The company acquired control of the Bayard foundries in Haute-Marne. It also took stakes in the Micheville and Marine- Hom√©court steel makers, and after the war would take interests in steelworks in Lorraine and the Saar. At the 23 January 1900 meeting Cavallier pointed out the importance of securing a supply of coke, and proposed to acquire a concession to open a new coal mine. In January 1902 Cavallier began to discuss a joint operation with the Soci√©t√© de Micheville and the Soci√©t√© du Nord et de l'Est to exploit coal deposits in northern Belgium, leading to incorporation of the Soci√©t√© Campinoise on 11 April 1902. The Beeringen-Coursel concession was granted to a group of three exploration companies on 26 November 1906, and Pont-√†-Mousson participated in creation of the Soci√©t√© des Charbonnages de Beeringen (Beringen Coal Company) on 23 February 1907. The Beringen deposit was rich, but covered by a layer thick of sands containing aquifers. It was not until after World War I (1914‚Äì18) that the first pit was opened on 26 December 1921. In Lorraine Cavallier explored for a continuation of the Saarbr√ºcken coalfield. A test drill of near the central station of the Pont-√†- Mousson plant found several layers of coal, but only at great depth. The company took an interest in coal mines in several other parts of northern France. World War I (1914‚Äì18) Pont-√†-Mousson on 3 November 1918 At the start of World War I the Pont-√†-Mousson factory was occupied by the Germans for a few days, and remained less than from the front line. Aubou√© was occupied. The Foug factory remained in operation, and was converted to manufacture of munitions. Workshops were established at Belleville in 1916 and Sens in 1917. In 1917 Cavallier founded the Fonderie Lorraine to manufacture war materials in Saint-√âtienne-du-Rouvray, near Rouen. His son in law, Marcel Paul, was given responsibility for the plant, which was built on between the railway and the river. By the end of the war 20% of French shells were being made from cast iron in the Foug foundry. At the 24 January 1917 general meeting Cavallier proposed to appoint a board of directors with representatives of capital and labour. Cavallier became deputy chairman in 1917, and three administrators were named. Marcel Paul was titled administrateur d√©l√©gu√© and the other two were titled administrateur directeur g√©n√©ral. Towards the end of the war study groups under Humbert de Wendel defined the demands of the Comite des Forges for the post-war settlement. They wanted return of Alsace-Lorraine, cession of the Saar and transfer of Luxembourg from the German Customs Union to a union with Belgium. Camille Cavallier was one of a small number of iron masters who also wanted the left bank of the Rhine. Post-war period (1918‚Äì26) In the post-war period the company faced a massive task of reconstruction, while training new workers to replace those lost in the war. In 1919‚Äì20 Pont-√†-Mousson took over a major pipe-making facility in the Saar. The company also acquired interests in Lorraine companies that had been liquidated, notably Rombas, and acquired interests in coal mines in the Saar and Moselle. President Raymond Poincar√© lit the first reconstructed blast furnace at Pont-√†-Mousson 23 November 1919 in a solemn ceremony. Within France, Cavallier was in favor of quota agreements between competing companies to prevent destructive price wars. German demand for iron from Lorraine plummeted after World War I (1914‚Äì18). By 1922 total demand was just a tenth of the pre-war demand from the Ruhr alone. Contributing factors were the growing use of the Siemens-Martin process of open hearth furnaces for recycling scrap steel combined with availability of war material to be recycled. In early 1922 Robert Pinot of the Comit√© des forges explained to Camille Cavallier that this had \\"permitted a boycotting of our minette ore these past years.\\" However, Pont-√†-Mousson gradually regained its export markets. Blast furnace at Pont-√†-Mousson (2008) On 7 May 1924 Cavallier said the company was self-sufficient in iron ore, and would soon be self-sufficient in coke. It was not until 1925 that Cavallier was able to announce that production had returned to prewar levels. When Cavallier died in 1926 annual production had reached 237,000 tons. His strategy as a pipe specialist led him to move into the export market early on so the company would not depend on fluctuating domestic demand. By the time he died half of the company's output was exported, with 450 foreign cities using Pont-√†- Mousson pipes, 127 of them outside of Europe. Cavallier knew that exports forced industry to become more competitive and efficient, and reduced costs helped domestic customers. Cavallier became Vice-President of the Nancy Chamber of Commerce and a member of many committees and associations. He died of a heart attack on 10 June 1926 at his property of Gentilly, at Max√©ville, near Nancy, the day after presiding over a general shareholders meeting. At the time of his death he was a member of the board of the Comit√© des Forges de France, director of about twenty companies, and had received many honors and official commissions. Cavallier had chosen his son-in-law, Marcel Paul, as his successor. The heirs of Xavier Rog√© and two other shareholders, Colonel Plassiart and the Lorraine banker Paul Lenglet, still had sizeable shareholdings. In the early 1920s Cavallier arranged for them to form a pact within a financial company, Filor (Financi√®re Lorraine). This lasted until 1964, when the founding families still controlled 50% of the capital of Pont- √†-Mousson.

He has been credited as the co-founder of 3Com and the co-inventor of the Ethernet. Biography Crane graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for his bachelor's degree in 1972 and from Stanford University for his master's degree in 1974, both in electrical engineering. In 1973, while pursuing his doctorate degree at Stanford, Crane joined the TCP/IP protocol research team, headed by Vint Cerf. Subsequently, when a \\"Birth of the Internet\\" plaque was installed on Stanford grounds in 2005, Ron Crane was mentioned as well as his colleague Bob Metcalfe as being fundamental contributors to the birth of the Internet. Crane left Stanford in 1974, accepting a master's instead of his planned doctorate degree, and worked at the Xerox Systems Development Division, a spinoff of Xerox PARC, where he was responsible for enhancing the original Ethernet transmission system. Crane joined Robert Metcalfe at 3Com as the fourth employee and co-founder in 1979. It was here at 3Com that Crane developed the 3C100, the first Thick Ethernet transceiver for the IBM PC, which went on to be the first major product offered by 3Com. Crane co-founded LAN Media Corporation with David Boggs, which was later acquired by SBE Incorporated in 2000, which was in turn acquired by Neonode in 2007. In 2006, Crane endowed a professorship at MIT to support energy-related research. Crane died on June 19, 2017 from complications of an aggressive form of prostate cancer. A memorial event was held at The Computer History Museum and attended by over 100 esteemed colleagues, friends, and family. Bob Metcalfe gave the closing speech.

Estate No. 12 was given the name Kalhave and sold to the merchant and shipowner Peter Johansen. He renamed it Petersgaard and constructed a main building on the land in 1776-1780\\\\. He created a thriving agricultural estate and also established a dockyard, which was given the name Petersv√¶rft. =Changing owners= Peter Johansen died on the estate in 1798, and his heirs sold it to the Crown the following year. The Crown embarked on the process of implementing the agricultural reforms of the time on the estate. Petersgaard, without the surrounding forests, was sold to Jacob Bentzon Resch. It was difficult times for Danish agriculture, and he had to sell the estate in 1810. The new owner was Christian Wulff, a grandson of Peter Johansen. He sold it to Michael Conrad Fabritius de Tengnagel, the occupant of the Iselinske Fideikommis, who refurbished the buildings. His widow, Nana Felicia Augusta Fabritius de Tengnagel, n√©e Bilsted, stayed on the estate after his death in 1849 and married Hans Ditmar Frederik Feddersen in 1855. In 1864, the year after the death of her second husband, she sold Petersgaard to Peder Br√∏nnum Scavenius. It was passed on to his son of the same name after his death in 1868. =Suhr and Juel= Petersgaard on a drawing by Ferdinand Richardt, 1976 In 1870, Scavenius' son sold it to the wealthy merchant Ole Bernt Suhr, who had already purchased the Petersgaard forests from the state two years earlier. On his death, Petersgaard was passed to J√∏rgen Peter Bech, husband of Suhr's eldest daughter Caroline Charlotte Suhr, who was himself out of a wealthy family of landowners. In 1885, Petersgaard was ceded to Caroline Charlotte Suhr younger sister Ida Marie Suhr, She was part of the clientele that met at Br√∏ndums Hotel in Skagen each year and socialized with artists such as Michael and Anna Ancher, the violinist Karen Falck and her husband Gustav Falck and Jenny Falck. Ida Marie Suhr never married. She therefore endowed Petersgaard to her relative Jens Juel, a grandson of her sister Sophie Clara Anna Suhr and Frederik Vilhelm Treschow of Krabbesholm. On his death in 1949, Petersgaard passed to his son Knud Rudolf Iuel. Architecture The Neoclassical main building consists of two storeys above a raised cellar and has a hipped tile roof with two chimneys. The facade has a three-bay median risalit tipped by a triangular pediment. A small, one-storey annex with thatched roof projects from the north side of the building. It is known as Little Petersgaard and dates from 1850.

This was the opening action of the Rhine Campaign of 1796 on the Upper Rhine, slightly north of the town of Kehl. The Coalition, commanded by Franz Petrasch, lost 10 percent of its manpower missing, killed or wounded. It was fought at the village of Maudach, southwest of Ludwigshafen on the Rhine river opposite Mannheim. Maudach lies northwest of Speyer and today is a southwest suburb of Ludwigshafen; a principal town on the Rhine river in 1796. Background Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as an internal dispute between the French king and his subjects. As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident, the European monarchs declared that their interests were the same as Louis XVI and his family; the Declaration of Pillnitz (27 August 1791) threatened ambiguous but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The position of the revolutionaries became increasingly difficult and compounding their problems in international relations, French √©migr√©s continued to agitate for support of a counter- revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria, beginning the War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì98). France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.Timothy Blanning. The French Revolutionary Wars, New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 41‚Äì59. Despite some victories in 1792, by early 1793 French forces had been pushed out of Belgium, there was an internal revolt in the Vend√©e over conscription, wide-spread public resentment of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and the French king had just been executed. The armies of the French Republic were in a state of disruption; the problems became even more acute following the introduction of mass conscription, the lev√©e en masse, which saturated an already distressed army with thousands of illiterate, untrained men. R. Dupuy, Nouvelle histoire de la France contemporaine. La R√©publique jacobine, 2005, p.156. For the French, the Rhine Campaign of 1795 proved especially disastrous, although they had achieved some success in other theaters of war (see for example, War of the Pyrenees (1793‚Äì95)). =1796 campaign= At the end of the Rhine Campaign of 1795, the two sides had called a truce.Theodore Ayrault Dodge, Warfare in the Age of Napoleon: The Revolutionary Wars Against the First Coalition in Northern Europe and the Italian Campaign, 1789‚Äì1797, Leonaur, 2011 , pp. 286‚Äì287. War preparations continued and in a decree on 6 January 1796, Lazare Carnot gave Germany priority over Italy as a theater of war. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan commanding the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse was instructed to besiege Mainz and cross the Rhine into Franconia. Farther south, Jean Victor Marie Moreau was to lead the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle across the Rhine, besiege or take Mannheim and conduct invasions of the Duchy of Baden, Swabia and the Duchy of Bavaria. Moreau was to converge on Vienna while Jourdan veered south to provide a rear guard. On the secondary front, Napoleon Bonaparte was to invade Italy, neutralize the Kingdom of Sardinia and seize Lombardy from the Austrians. The Italian army would then cross the Alps via the County of Tyrol and join the other French armies in crushing the Austrian forces in southern Germany. By the spring of 1796, Jourdan and Moreau each had 70,000 men while Bonaparte's army numbered 63,000, including reserves and garrisons. Fran√ßois Christophe de Kellermann counted 20,000 troops in the Army of the Alps and there was a small army in southern France. The finances of the French First Republic were so attenuated that its armies were expected to invade new territories and then live off of the conquered lands. David G. Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon Macmillan, 1966, pp. 46‚Äì47 =Plans for 1796= In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88 members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, raised a small force of about 7,000 men comprising raw recruits, field hands, and day laborers drafted for service. It was largely guess work where they should be placed and Charles did not like to use the militias in any vital location.Digby Smith, Napoleonic Wars Data Book. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole, 1999. pp. 111‚Äì114. In late May and early June, when the French started to mass troops by Mainz as if they would cross there‚Äîthey even engaged the Imperial force at Altenkirchen (4 June) and Wetzler and Uckerath (15 June)‚ÄîCharles thought that the main attack would occur there and felt few qualms placing the 7,000-man Swabian militia at the crossing by Kehl.Smith, p. 114. Preliminary operations Map of Rhine River shows D√ºsseldorf and the Sieg and Lahn Rivers in the north and Strasbourg and Mannheim in the south. The colors different sections of the Rhine River: blue is the Alp Rhine and the Lake Rhine (where the river runs through Lake Constance); turquoise indicates the High Rhine (which runs east to west through of Lake Constance); The Upper Rhine (green) begins where the river takes a sharp turn at the Rhine Knee, and flows south to north; yellow designates the Middle Rhine (sometimes called Mittelrhein) and orange designates the Low Rhine, where the Rhine passes into the Netherlands and reaches the North Sea. Louis Desaix, commanding the left (northern) column of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, had about 27,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry when he crossed the Rhine at Maudach. He faced Petrasch's division of about a third of the size, including mixed troops of infantry and dragoons. While Desaix crossed at Maudauch, Jourdan's main body crossed the Rhine on 10 June at Neuwied to join Kl√©ber and the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse advanced to the Lahn river. In the south, Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour took command of the Army of the Upper Rhine in place of Wurmser.Dodge, p. 288 Leaving 12,000 troops to guard Mannheim, Charles distributeded his remaining troops among his two armies and swiftly moved north against Jourdan. The Archduke defeated the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse at the Battle of Wetzlar on 15 June 1796 and Jourdan lost no time in recrossing the Rhine at Neuwied.Smith, p. 115 Battle The action at Maudach was part of a three-pronged feint at the Coalition's defenses in the middle Rhine. On 15 June, Desaix's 30,000-man command mauled Franz Petrasch's 11,000 Austrians at Maudach. The French suffered 600 casualties and the Austrians suffered three times as many. The Austrians clashed with Kl√©ber's divisions at Uckerath, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the French for only 600 casualties. Charles left 35,000 men with Wartensleben, 30,000 more in Mainz and the other fortresses along the Rhine and moved south with 20,000 troops to help Latour across from Speyer and Kl√©ber withdrew within the D√ºsseldorf defenses.Smith, p. 115 After another feint at the Austrian positions near Mannheim, Moreau sent his army south from Speyer on a forced march toward Strasbourg; Desaix crossed the Rhine at Kehl near Strasbourg on the night of 23‚Äì24 June. Aftermath On 24 June, at Kehl, Moreau's advance guard of 10,000 men preceded the main force of 27,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry directed at the Swabian pickets on the bridge. The Swabians were hopelessly outnumbered and could not be reinforced. Most of the Imperial Army of the Rhine was stationed further north, by Mannheim, where the river was easier to cross but too far away to support the smaller force at Kehl. Neither the Cond√©'s troops in Freiburg nor Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg's force in Rastatt could reach Kehl in time to support them. Charles, Archduke of Austria. Ausgew√§hlte Schriften weiland seiner Kaiserlichen Hoheit des Erzherzogs Carl von √ñsterreich, Vienna: Braum√ºller, 1893‚Äì94, v. 2, pp. 72, 153‚Äì154. Within a day, Moreau had four divisions across the river and thrust out of Kehl, the Swabian contingent reformed at Rastatt by 5 July and managed to hold the city until the French turned both flanks. Charles could not move much of his army away from Mannheim or Karlsruhe, where the French had also crossed the river and F√ºrstenberg could not hold the southern flank. At H√ºningen near Basel, on the same day that Moreau's advance guard crossed at Kehl, Ferino executed a full crossing and advanced unopposed eastwards along the German shore of the Rhine with the 16th and 50th Demi-brigades, the 68th, 50th and 68th line infantry and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons.Charles, pp. 153‚Äì154 and Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch.

It is described as \\"one of the finest bridges in Montgomeryshire\\" by the Gwynedd Archaeological Trust. History and description The bridge was initially a timber bridge, built in 1533 using ¬£6 13s 4d (10 marks) given by London merchant Geoffry Hughes. It was rebuilt in stone in 1681 and rebuilt again in 1805. The bridge is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and received a Grade II* heritage listing in 1952. The present day bridge carries the A487 road across the River Dyfi between Machynlleth (Montgomeryshire/Powys) and the Corris community (Merionethshire/Gwynedd). At 5.5 metres in width and 64 metres in length, the bridge has five arches, with the two arches at the Machynlleth end reinforced with modern steelwork. Future In 2011 a report was drawn up recommending the bridge was replaced or widened because of its strategic importance, as it had unsafe low parapets and a lack of footways, and had been repeatedly damaged by motor vehicles because of its poor sight lines. The recommendations were dismissed in favour of looking at options for a new bridge at a different location. On 19 May 2017 the Welsh government published a statement that a new bridge would be constructed about 500 m upstream from the current bridge. Work was scheduled to start near the end of 2018 and the completion of the bridge (being ready for traffic) was envisaged in the summer of 2020. The start date was subsequently delayed till at least 2019, with a public enquiry possibly required depending on the results of consultation. On 13 January 2020 the Welsh government announced that there would be no public enquiry, and construction would start in the summer of 2020 with estimated completion in summer 2022.

The destroyers were designed as ocean-going escort ships, which could attack and defend convoys in the Atlantic, while also being able to operate in tropical climates. The design was abandoned before any ships were ordered or laid down, largely because the range and speed requirements could not be achieved without reductions in armament, however it went on to influence later project studies: the Type 1938Ac, 1938Ad, and 1938B destroyers. Development The Type 1937J was designed in 1937, and was one of five project studies done by the Kriegsmarine in this year, the others being the Type 1937-I, II, III and IV destroyers. These five projects were all project studies for a \\"Type 1937 destroyer\\". The Type 1937 destroyers were to be ocean-going escort ships, which could serve in the tropics and could attack and defend convoys in the Atlantic. They were planned as a replacement for the Type 1936 and Type 1936A destroyers. They were designed to be able to match any given enemy destroyer. They were not planned to be able to combat French flotilla leaders, a task that would be left to either a light cruiser, or else multiple Type 1937s, if needed. The initial design called for it to have a radius of , and six guns in twin mountings, with a simple firing control system. Due to the experiences gained from the Type 1934, an increase in gun caliber to was initially not approved, as it was feared that it would limit their seaworthiness. The original design was purposefully made so as to avoid a hybrid cruiser-destroyer design, which would not be able to perform either role well. From this original design came forth the five project studies. Of these, the Type 1937J was deemed the best in terms of armament, with its five single guns, and thus was further worked upon, while the others were cancelled. However, problems arose due to the inability of contemporary naval technology to simultaneously meet the requirements for weight, speed, range and armament. On 8 April 1938 German Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, the commander in chief of the Kriegsmarine, informed the Oberkommando der Marine (German Naval High Command) that the Type 1937J design work was to be stopped, and that a further eight Type 36 destroyers were to be built instead. Although no ships of the Type 1937J were ever ordered or laid down, they influenced the later project studies: the Type 1938Ac, 1938Ad, and 1938B destroyers. Characteristics The design specifications were eventually shown to be unworkable, but during the concept phase the Type 1937J destroyers were designed to be long, wide, have a depth of , a draught of and displace at standard load, at design load and at full load. They were to have a complement of 360 men. The Type 1937J destroyers were to be armed with five quick firing guns, one anti-aircraft gun, four anti-aircraft guns, two twin torpedo tubes and one quadruple 53.3 centimetre torpedo tube. Little is known of their propulsion systems but it is known that they were designed to have an output of , giving them a conceptual top speed of .

Reservists on Duty works to engage college students through a number of projects which challenge BDS and the industry of lies being sold to them, and reframes the conversation about Israel. Within Israel, the organization focuses on countering organizations that assist and enable BDS and the demonization of Israel. The organization is funded by private donations.  Background  The organization was established in 2015 by Amit Deri, the former director of the pre-military college, Tavor, in Upper Nazareth. The idea of establishing the organization took shape after Deri witnessed a protest of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement in Ireland, where spokesmen for BDS grounded their arguments against Israel's treatment of Palestinians with material obtained from Israeli NGOs, such as Breaking the Silence. Deri felt that there was distortion in the way that this material was presented, and decided to combat this information by forming a forum of reserve soldiers who were able to respond to allegations of misconduct. The organization was founded after dozens of Israeli Defense Force officers and soldiers decided to take action against the activity of Breaking the Silence and signed a petition. They demanded that the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, stop this organization's cooperation with state institutions and particularly the IDF. Moreover, they demanded that he prevent the funding of Breaking the Silence by foreign countries. The petition received the support of over half of the Knesset members.  Activity  The objective of the organization is to expose BDS supporters both in Israel and on campuses across the United States, to share the Israeli point of view about the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, and to make it more accessible and understandable to the public. The organization aspires to become a main source in the field, calling this the \\"Gideon Group\\", which is the main project of the organization, where around a hundred volunteers, former lone soldiers, minorities and students are sent to campuses across the USA during the Israeli Apartheid Week, in order to fight the anti- Israeli propaganda and to promote dialogue. These volunteers visit campuses, stay in touch with pro-Israel communities in their area, and generally serve as pro-Israel ambassadors. The organization sees Pro-Israel American Jews as an efficient and effective cause of influence in the front of the battle field on campuses. In their view, their advantage is understanding the unique challenges around the campuses on the one hand as Americans, and the life in Israel as Israelis on the other. The organization sends delegations of volunteers to campuses in order to interact with students and let them learn another, more personal side to the story during weeks of anti-Israel events. In Israel, the organization's activity focuses on exposing hidden intentions of Anti-Israeli organizations, such as Breaking the Silence and B'Tselem. Among other things, the organization has established a hotline for former and current IDF soldiers that suffered from harassment from Breaking the Silence asking them (after operation \\"Tzuk Eitan\\") to give testimonies from the battles. The organization has also launched complaints against the newspaper, Haaretz. They claimed that BDS activists base themselves abundantly on their reports, which were also given in English. They claim that Haaretz stories promote the demonization of Israel in general and the IDF particularly. The organization holds conferences in Israel and around the world in regards to ethics in combat warfare and the double standards that they claim exist in the world with regards to the State of Israel. In April 2017, Reservists on Duty made headlines after posting a response video to the testimony of Dean Issacharoff, the spokesman of Breaking the Silence. In this testimony he claimed that during his service as a platoon commander he hit a Palestinian until he bled, in front of his entire platoon and his company commander. In the response video, posted by Reservists on Duty, Issacharoff's commander and a dozen of his platoon's soldiers stood in front of the camera, and claim that his testimony is a lie and his story didn't happen. This event led the Minister of Justice, Ayelet Shaked, to ask the Attorney General of Israel, Avichai Mandelblit, to investigate Issaharof and prosecute him if his story (that he beat a Palestinian) was true. Issaharof was indeed investigated under warning. The police and State Attorney's investigation determined Issacharoff's testimony was untrue. After the case was closed, some--including Issacharoff, Breaking the Silence and B'Tselem--claimed the police interrogated the wrong Palestinian. In October 2017, the group organized a two-week tour across US campuses that featured talks from pro-Israel Arabs, including Muslims, a Christian and a Druse.

It was originally established as an idea envisioned by the late Amir Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah in the late 1950s, when he aspired to build a special mansion for him and his family. To achieve that, the late Amir headed to Egypt to search for a specialized architect who could turn his vision of the mansion into reality. He eventually commissioned architect Medhat Al-Abed, who designed a round-shaped palace with magnificent interior decorations.  History  In 1960, during the reign of late Amir Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, construction works began for the palace's basic structure. However, in 1961 and after the official declaration of country's independence, some changes were made on the palace's residential plans due to the urgent need at that time for an official guesthouse for Kuwait's top visitors, including kings, presidents, and other prominent figures, in addition to a place to hold official and international conferences and meetings. Thus, the government decided to complete constructions for the spectacular building and transfer its ownership officially to the state. The palace was officially inaugurated in 1964, and received its first world leader guest in that same year. Around 166 world leaders have stayed at Al Salam Palace since its official opening, including the likes of the Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, former French President Valery Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing and Charles and Diana, the Prince and Princess of Wales. The palace, which total costs estimated nearly US$16.5 million, was characterized by its beautiful and luxurious facilities. Its fancy exterior round-shaped design reflected on its interior design, with its crystal chandeliers' lights visible through its windows, illuminating its superb vicinity at Shuwaikh beach for passersby to enjoy. Al Salam Palace continued to receive Kuwait's guests until 1990, when Iraq invaded the country, destroyed the palace and stole its contents. Afterwards, the palace faded into oblivion after the country's liberation in 1991, especially after handing over its role and missions to the newly built Bayan Palace to host the country's guests. The palace stayed abandoned and neglected until 2013, when Sheikha Mona Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Head of Historic Documentation Center and the Amiri Diwan Libraries, proposed to restore the historic guesthouse and turn it into a museum that combines various time phases from the 300-year history of Kuwait. Combined Group Contracting has secured a KWD 39 million (US$129 million) contract to carry out the renovation and reconstruction of the Al Salam Palace. Sheikha Mona's proposal received approval and encouragement by His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al- Jaber Al-Sabah, prompting the Amiri Diwan to carry out reconstruction of the palace until it was finally completed and officially inaugurated by His Highness the Amir on Monday, April 29, 2019. The newly restored building houses a collection of rare artifacts and preserve the national cultural heritage of Kuwait. It has been designed to suit the modern generation provided with the latest technological display methods to presents the history of Kuwait to visitors in a creative and innovative manner.

He lived around the turn of the 14th/15th centuries, and preached a system that can be compared to modern Communism. Between 1415‚Äì1416 he gathered Turkmen peasants, Greek sailors and Jewish merchants on the Karaburun peninsula in order to rebel against high taxes and other injustices. Primary accounts B√∂rkl√ºce Mustafa's life is relatively obscure, and well into the 20th century scarcely covered by scholarship, except in the context of his mentor, Sheikh Bedreddin. The main primary account on his activities is that of the Byzantine historian Doukas, along with a few scattered references in other sources. As a result, not even his name is certain, \\"B√∂rkl√ºce Mustafa\\" being but one of the suggested original names for Doukas' Hellenized rendering Œ†ŒµœÅŒ∫ŒªŒπœÑŒ∂ŒØŒ± ŒúŒøœÖœÉœÑŒ±œÜ·æ∂. Origin and teachings Mustafa himself possibly hailed from Samos Island, since a Cretan hermit on Chios maintained to Doukas that he had known Mustafa, who was then living as a hermit or dervish on that island. Eventually, Mustafa was won over by the teachings of Sheikh Bedreddin, a supporter of Musa √áelebi during the Ottoman Interregnum, who had been exiled by Sultan Mehmed I to Iznik. Mustafa however moved beyond his master in his efforts to approach the common people, and his teachings were \\"nothing short of revolutionary\\": apart from the renunciation of wealth and common ownership of goods, he also espoused the rapprochement and complete equality between Muslims and Christians. According to Doukas, he urged his followers to treat Christians as fellow believers and show them hospitality. Doukas even attributes to him the formulation \\"Every Turk [i.e., Muslim] who says that the Christians are not faithful to God, is himself an unbeliever\\". Mustafa himself set the example for his followers by living as a simple hermit, devoting his life entirely to prayer and the propagation of his ideas. For the latter purpose, he established a missionary organization, sending forth \\"apostles\\" or \\"stylarioi\\" (after the location of the mountain where he lived). These missionaries were obliged to poverty, and went about clad only in a tunic, without shoes, and with shorn heads. When Sheikh Bedreddin fled from Iznik to Sinop, Mustafa too abandoned this area, seeking to establish himself and his followers in a place of greater safety than the former Ottoman capital. For this reason, he chose the Karaburun peninsula on the Aegean coast, where he and his followers settled in large numbers. In his nightly prayers, he claimed to mystically communicate with the Cretan hermit on Chios, who in turn told Doukas in person that Mustafa came to visit him every other night. Revolt According to different sources he gathered around 4.000-10.000 people. In the beginning of the rebellion ƒ∞skender Pa≈üa tried to crush the revolt, but he couldn't because of the narrow alleys of the Karaburun peninsula. The people of Karaburun managed to crush the army of ƒ∞skender Pa≈üa. After this more Turkmen Muslims and Christians joined the rebellion. After the defeat Mehmed sent Timurta≈ü Pa≈üazade Ali Bey with all the troops of the Saruhan province and Aydin to Karaburun. These troops were also defeated by the peasants. Ali Bey managed to flee to Manisa. Mehmed who heard the news this time sent his son Murat and Bayezid pa≈üa with the troops of Rumelia and reinforcements from Anatolia on B√∂rkl√ºce. On his road to a mountain which was arbitrated by dervishes Bayezid pa≈üa massacred all the people including women, children and old people. On one hand there was a bloody conflict at the Cehennem valley and on the other hand the Ottoman army controlled the harbors of the Sakiz island in order to prevent people from fleeing. A large number of the followers of B√∂rkl√ºce were massacred. B√∂rkl√ºce tried to flee to the Sakiz island with the rest of the people, but when he arrived he noticed the Ottoman navy. After a bloody battle B√∂rkl√ºce and his men couldn't flee and moved to the north of the peninsula where they were captured. B√∂rkl√ºce was taken hostage and after a lot of torturing he still insisted on his beliefs and demands. As a result, he was crucified and bound on the back of a camel to be ridiculed and shown around. The dervishes who stayed loyal to him were killed in front of his eyes. Meanwhile, there was a similar rebellion in Manisa which was probably linked with the rebellion of Karaburun. The rebellion in Manisa was under the leadership of Torlak Kemal.  Philosophy and his works  B√∂rkl√ºce Mustafa was considered as an important philosopher by many theologians and philosophers in the Islamic world. He wrote Tasv√Ær√º'l- Kul√ªb.

It is located on the Castulus square, in Old town near Convent of Saint Agnes. It is the only church in the Czech Republic consecrated to Saint Castulus.  History  The church was built between 1375 and 1399, at the same location as the Romanesque church. This was one of the main Romanesque churches in Prague, that was documented in 1234. It was built by the road leading from the ford near St. Valentine, around the jew settlement, to ‚Äúna Po≈ô√≠ƒç√≠‚Äù. The further documentation was preserved in the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century from renovation of altars of St. Catherine, St. Virgin Mary, St. Margaret and altar of God‚Äôs body. In the 14th century, there was also a cemetery and parsonage in vicinity of the church. The most significant stage of construction in the 14th century can be reconstructed based on reports, structural and architectural analysis. Construction of the Gothic church started on the western and the eastern side of the Romanesque church approximately during the 14th century. The first part that was built was the polygon-shaped choir, part of the main nave and the southern nave. After a break when the construction of the northern nave should have begun, the initial project was changed, and it was decided to go with double-nave hall, instead of simple side nave, following style of architecture during the reign of king Wenceslaus IV. This stage was partially finished in 1375 when there is documented the establishment of the chapel of All Saints, place of today‚Äôs sacristy. The stonemasonry of Peter Parler also participated during construction, which is proven by finest stonework especially complex corbels on the perimeter walls of the side nave. When the rest of the Romanesque church was demolished, the western part of the main nave with the front wall was finished, which interconnected the western part of the double nave. Meanwhile, at the east side of the church in front of the double-nave, the sacristy was built as an additional part of choir. The change of plans was discovered mainly because of style change of the double nave, and also because of the situation above the vault under the ceiling. New solution for the building was convergence of supporting arcade pillars, which created characteristic T-shape. This resulted in wall pressure relief above arcades between naves which holds the weight of the vault. Church and also parsonage were damaged during Hussite wars, in 1432 the church was flooded and in 1436 the altars were consecrated again. Then the parish was under control of ultraquists until 1624. Between 1500 and 1604 the tower was reconstructed. In 1620 a new cemetery was established in the parish garden and a new Lutheran school was built. From 1624 the church was administered by the Catholics and then, until 1739 by parish of Church of Our Lady before T√Ωn. In 1689 the church burnt down. The vault of the main ship fell, the tower was burnt and the bells were destroyed. After these accidents church was partially rebuilt to Baroque style by P.I. Bayer. These changes were made especially in main nave and choir where original vault was replaced by barrel vault. The reconstruction was finished in 1695, and the tower was rebuilt in 1714. After 1851, the whole church was repaired - the interior was flushed, and the altars and the pulpit were repaired. In 1885 the interior of the double-nave and its porch were repaired.  Description  The church is mainly a stone building, the northern side of presbytery was made from bricks and part from the northern side of the main nave was made of blocks. The length of the church is 33 m, the width of double nave is 8 meters and the width of side nave is 9 meters.The entrance with a portal = Exterior = Today‚Äôs shape is irregular four nave church with tower above the western side of southern nave, with Sacristy by northern side of presbytery. From the outside, the temple appears to be plain without a distinct division. From facade stick up simple once graded supporting pillars with pent roofs. Prism shaped tower is covered with low ogee arch roof. The outlines of original pointed arch-windows are slightly visible and windows were lowered. The western entrance is emphasised by a portal. = Interior =  Main nave  The main entrance of the church is allocated from the western part to enter into the narthex and the main nave. It is vaulted by four inconspicuous bays of Baroque barrel vault with lunettes. There are simple pilasters on second and third pillar and double pilasters on the other pillars. The original Gothic vault, which was roughly 1 m taller, is visible in the loft only. On the western part of the main nave there is renaissance matroneum, the room underneath is vaulted by groin vault. A small door leading to spiral staircase leading to matroneum is located at the south side of the entrance in the main nave. Presbytery and main nave are about 18 m tall. Between main and side naves there are semicircular vaulted arcades with cornices. Its original Gothic pointed-arch arcades are located on sides of side naves.  Choir  The choir is vaulted by a single bay barrel vault with lunettes, the apse consists of 5 sides of an octagon. The vault is lower than the original Gothic one. The walls are divided by double pilasters with Corinthian capitals. The original, Gothic windows were lowered and finished semicircular in Baroque reconstruction.  Southern nave  The southern nave is vaulted by Gothic rib vault with wedge-shaped ribs. Then it continues to bays corners onto cornice capitals, finished with prismatic console. Round keystones are plain and unadorned. On the southern nave there are original Gothic windows without tracery. Floor plan of the church  Northern nave  On the opposite side of the church there is taller northern double-nave hall, rib vault, where the ribs are subtler. Supporting columns are also subtle with round base and on one side they consist of consoles with plant decoration below a mask of a wild man.  Porches  In front of the northern and southern portals there are two smaller porches. The northern one has a Gothic interior. The windows are wide with no tracery, they have a more complex profile and the window jamb similar to the window of the western facade illuminating the main nave and the northern portal to the double-nave. The other porch built in Baroque is covered with a hip roof, with an entry in the aedicula, vaulted by groin vault, similar to the vault under the matroneum. In front of the southern entrance there is a similar porch, vaulted by a barell vault with lunettes as in the main ship.  Sacristy  At the east part of the church - at the north side of the choir there is Gothic sacristy, vaulted by a complex, two bay rib vault. Subtle ribs are decorated with plant decoration which are connected to simple pyramidal and conical consoles around which the front arches are wrapped in the right angle. Between the vault-bays there is an inconspicuous partition that created a separate entrance to a spiral staircase that is leading to treasury above the sacristy. The sacristy was consecrated as a Chapel of All Saints in 1375. The paintings of Last Supper and Crucifixion which are now damaged and indistinct were presumably created in the same year.  Painted windows  Painted windows were created between 1884 and 1912. In presbytery they have a simple decoration and were created in 1884. In the side naves they are decorated with figural paintings - st. Agnese (1885), st. Cecilia (1906), Ludmila (1910), Wenceslaus and Ferdinand (1912), and st. Joseph.

The association was formed in 1884 and incorporated in 1926 in a small pioneer cabin located on the Wyoming State Fairgrounds in Douglas; the Wyoming legislature appropriated funds for construction of a museum at the same location in 1956, and the association expanded its facilities in 2013 to add the Ruthe James Williams Center.  History  The group that would become the association began annual meetings at the Wyoming State Fair in 1905, following unofficial meetings dating back to 1884. The attendees at the original meeting site in the Wyoming Pioneer Cabin included soldiers, freighters, cowboys, and stockmen, many of whom had been instrumental in achieving statehood for Wyoming. The Wyoming's Old Timer's Association, created in 1914, is the precursor of the Wyoming Pioneer Association. Some members defined \\"Old Timers\\" as \\"including only those who personally had a part in bringing the Territory into Statehood.\\" The first president of the association was John Hunton. The Wyoming Pioneer Association was incorporated on January 8, 1926. The association first met on September 15, 1926, in downtown Douglas, at the Princess Theater. Hunton called the first meeting to order that day. The association founded itself upon the Old Timers association. By the 1950s, the cabin was insufficient to accommodate the increased membership when being used for meetings. In 1956 the Wyoming Legislature appropriated state funds to build the Wyoming Pioneer Museum. This allowed the Association to build a new structure to replace the cabin's functions for social gatherings and for housing the Association's possessions. The museum was approved and built on the Wyoming State Fairgrounds next door to the cabin. In 2013, the Association financed and constructed the Ruthe James Williams Center located adjacent to the museum. = Ruthe James Williams Center = \\"In 1927 the Wyoming Pioneer Association built the Pioneer Cabin to host their annual meetings. Just one year earlier, the group dating back to 1884, was incorporated,\\" says President Mary Engebretsen. \\"In recent years, with a group too large for the cabin, we've been meeting in the Wyoming State Fair Cafeteria.\\" Circa 2012 the association recognized a need to increase the size of their meeting facilities and display space for historical artifacts. The new building was funded by a large contribution from Jack and Ruthe James Williams and named in Ruthe's honor. James Williams' parents were pioneers who made their home in the Douglas, Wyoming, area in 1917, and gave birth to her in 1919. James Williams grew up mostly in Douglas. She received formal education in Douglas, but also in Idaho, where her parents had immigrated from. In Douglas, she and Jack courted. Williams was a member of the Wyoming National Guard, stationed in Fort Lewis, Washington, when Pearl Harbor was bombed in December 1941. In March 1942, Williams died in an accidental fire in the company barracks in Roseburg, Oregon, that morning. Unbeknownst to anyone, six months prior, the couple had gotten married when Williams was on furlough in Wyoming. Due to the circumstances of his death, James Williams moved to Washington State in accordance with the earlier plans she and Williams had made. When James Williams died in 2008, she bequeathed Wyoming Pioneer Association a significant piece of her estate. The Wyoming Pioneer Association expended the bulk of those funds to construct the Ruthe James Williams Center. In 2013, association members met in the new center. =Present day= The Wyoming Pioneer Association celebrated 125 years in 2015. They celebrated during the Wyoming State Fair which ran from August 7 through 16 in Douglas, Wyoming. Specially for this year were the 1926 Pioneer Cabin and the Grist Mill being open to the public. The association tallied almost 1,200 people visiting the cabin. \\"It was very exciting, and this is just the beginning,\\" Mary Engebretson, president of the association says. \\"We now have a Memorandum of Understanding with State Parks and Cultural Resources and the Wyoming Department of Agriculture that allows us the flexibility to open, use and showcase the historical buildings, which are the original Pioneer Cabin, two school houses and the Grist Mill, to do a lot more with the old buildings and more in creating the complex.\\"  Mission and purpose  In 2016, the Association's president, Bob Vollman, changed the association's mission to the following: > The mission and purpose of the Wyoming Pioneer Association is to keep alive > the traditions of family loyalty, integrity, and honor that have sustained > us in the past and made Wyoming great. We will build on our heritage and > history with the confidence that our future generations will be as proud of > us as we are of our ancestors. The Wyoming Pioneer Association acts as an advisory board to the Pioneer Museum, which is operated by the state. The museum is open all year. The museum collects and displays artifacts important to the West and its expansion as well as to pioneers.  Wyoming Pioneer Museum  The museum was first created in 1927 in what is now referred to as the Wyoming Pioneer Cabin. The association operated the museum at that site until 1956, when the state built a new museum using appropriated funds. In 2017, the museum created an Advisory Council to support the superintendent, and the association has a permanent voting member. The association continues in its role as the Friends of the Museum Group. The museum has been running continuously since 1927, and over 50 years in its current building. Some examples of items on display are an original jackalope, a historic bar, historic photographs, and a Native American artifact collection. An exciting item also is the bib overalls from 1979 ProRodeo Hall of Fame inductee stock contractor Charles Irwin.  Memorials  One of the ways the Wyoming Pioneer Association currently gets involved in the Wyoming community is to recognize and honor work having to do with cemeteries and veterans. Hunton's grave front view Hunton's grave rear view In 2010, John C. Hunton received a proper grave marker from the association. In 1839 Hunton was born in Madison, Virginia and served in the American Civil War prior to relocating to Wyoming. In addition to being the founding president, Hunton was one of Wyoming's first cattlemen. He worked many positions and started his own businesses throughout Wyoming Territory. His diaries \\"serve as some of Wyoming‚Äôs earliest historical documents\\". He helped found the Wyoming Stock Growers Association and the Cheyenne Social Club. In 1890, Wyoming achieved statehood, and helping found the Wyoming Pioneer Association was key to that goal. Hunton served as Laramie County Commissioner in Cheyenne. He died September 4, 1928, at 89 years of age and was buried in Cheyenne, Wyoming with only a small white stone with his initials marking the spot. Association member and Cheyenne resident, Beverly Holmes, and retired Army Colonel Bob Fesack worked to facilitate the new marker, using Hunton's Civil War records to apply to the Veteran's Administration for the gravestone. The new gravestone was installed next to the original marker in Westlake Cemetery. Prior to the ceremony, there was a presentation at the Wyoming National Guard Museum, where retired U.S. Army Colonel Bob Bezek shared Hunton's military history. The unveiling then took place at Lakeview Ceremony. Hunton served in the Virginia Infantry for the Confederate Army, including a spell as a prisoner of war. In 2016, the association granted its second Historical Restoration Award to a community who refurbished a cemetery in Niobrara County, Wyoming.

After serving ten months in the regular army, she transferred to the Army Ambulance service, a precursor to the Bolivian Red Cross. She earned the distinction as the \\"Mother of the Bolivian Soldier\\" for her care of the wounded and was honored as the Meritorious Heroine of the Homeland. Numerous monuments and awards throughout the country are named in her honor. Early life Ignacia Zeballos Taborga was born on 27 June 1831 in La Enconada, (now known as Warnes, in the Santa Cruz Department), Bolivia to Antonia Taborga and Pedro Zeballos. She was one of three siblings, having a brother, Daniel and a sister, Matilde and was twice widowed, giving birth to a daughter by her second husband, Blan (or Blanco). Career After the death of her second husband, Zeballos moved to La Paz, where she worked as a seamstress. In 1876, during the coups d'√©tat led by Hilari√≥n Daza to oust President Tom√°s Fr√≠as, she participated in the burning of Palacio Quemado and then fled to the Bolivian coast, where she established a grocery. At the onset of the War of the Pacific, she was living in Puno with her daughter, but returned to La Paz after Chilean invasion of the Port of Antofagasta in 1879. In La Paz, she learned of the government's instruction to collect armaments and ammunition to defend the country. Wearing the uniform of her deceased husband, Zeballos joined the Colorados Battalion of the Eastern Rifles () of Velasco Squadron and rode on horseback with the troops to Tacna. Participating in the Battle of Alto de la Alianza, and the excursions at Ite and Moquegua, Zeballos served in the Army for ten months, helping the camp followers‚Äîknown as rabonas, who provided nursing services, carried arms and munitions for soldiers, and gathered intelligence which could assist the military‚Äîand soldiers, for whom she served as a rifle loader. After ten months of serving with no pay, General Eliodoro Camacho awarded pay of thirty bolivianos (Bs) to Zeballos and when he promoted her to the Ambulances of the Army () her pay increased to thirty-two Bs. per month. She was one of the first nurses to wear the emblem of the Red Cross into battle. In September 1880, having served for eighteen months, Zeballos wrote a letter to President Narciso Campero begging leave to return to Puno to check on her young daughter and asking for her back pay. Her service was distinguished by her care of the wounded, but also her attention to caring for the children of the rabonas. She also wandered the battlefield after the combatants had ceased fighting looking for the wounded to protect them from the Chilean forces who routinely reviewed the fallen looking to slit the throats of any survivors. When the war ended, the Bolivian National Convention of 1880 declared Zeballos as the Meritorious Heroine of the Homeland (), bestowed upon her the honorific title of Colonel of Health, and awarded her a gold medal with a lifetime pension of forty Bs. per month. Death and legacy Zeballos died on 5 September 1904 in La Paz and was buried with military honors in the Pantheon of Nobles of La Paz. In 1948, President Enrique Hertzog named the National School of Nurses in her honor. In 1982, her remains were re-interred at a monument dedicated in her honor near Warnes, located at a northern roundabout on the highway to Montero. When the transfer of her remains was approved, the Bolivian Armed Forced declared her to be the \\"Mother of the Bolivian Soldier\\". In 2016 the government of Yapacan√≠ created an award for the highest distinction of merit in health service or research which bears her name.

The modern regions it encompassed include Slavonia, Moslavina, Banovina, Bilogora and Podravina. Its political center was in Sisak. Pannonian Croatia is a retrospective name applied to it due to it being tied to modern Croatia. The polity's contemporaneous name and that of its populace remain unknown, although various names for both such as Sclavonia, Slavonia and Pannonia and respectively Sclaveni, Slavonians and Pannonias have been suggested. History Slavs came to the territory of the former Roman province Pannonia in the late 6th and early 7th century, as evidenced by many archeological finds. According to De administrando imperio, at the time of the rule of Emperor Herakleios (610‚Äì640), Croats arrived in Dalmatia, founded a duchy there and, shortly afterward, a part of them went to the north to Pannonia and founded another duchy there (Pannonian Croatia). In the late 7th century or in the 8th century, the Duchy became vassalaged to the Avar Empire, as archaeological finds suggest. After the defeat of the Avar Empire by Frankish troops, Duke Vojnomir was assigned the Duchy as a vassal of the Frankish margrave of Friuli. The Duchy failed to end Frankish domination during a rebellion under Duke Ljudevit Posavski in the early 9th century. In 827, the Bulgarians invaded and conquered the Duchy and parts of territories to the north of it. In 829 they imposed a local Duke Ratimir as the new ruler of Pannonian Croatia in their name. The Franks however claimed the territory, which in their view belonged (since 827) to the March of Carantania and thus under the rule of Count Ratbod, who had been head of the Avar March and March of Carantania since 828. In 838, Ratbod deposed Ratimir and subordinated the Duchy to the Frankish March of Carantania. Another known ruler of Pannonian Croatia was Braslav, who ruled there in 880‚Äì898 or 900, still vassalaged to the Kingdom of East Francia. In the 10th century, under Duke (later King) Tomislav, the Duchy of Pannonian Croatia might have been united with Littoral Croatia to form the Kingdom of Croatia. The sources of the extent of Tomislav's kingdom are however conflicting.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The building was designed by Captain Willey Cooper as the headquarters of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, The Duke of Wellington's Regiment and was built between 1899 and 1901. It was opened by Field Marshal Lord Roberts in May 1901. The 2nd Volunteer Battalion, The Duke of Wellington's Regiment evolved to become the 5th Battalion, The Duke of Wellington's Regiment in 1908. The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the Western Front. The 5th Battalion, The Duke of Wellington's Regiment converted to become the 43rd (5th Duke of Wellington's Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers in 1936 and, in the midst of the Second World War, it evolved to become the 600th Regiment, Royal Artillery (5th Battalion The Duke of Wellington's Regiment) in 1944, and, after the war, the 578th (5th Battalion The Duke of Wellington's) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery in 1947.

Language Yinggarda was a Kartu language spoken from the coastal area around Carnarvon through the Gascoyne River to the junction and southwards to the Wooramel River. The earliest record of the languages dates back from material collected by and anonymous source and forwarded by Lord Gifford to Edward Curr who published a list of basic words in 1886. There were two dialects, a northern and southern variety, with marked lexical differences. Down to the end of the 20th century, it was reported that the Carnavon community had a wide knowledge of Yingkarta words, but that their use was somewhat restricted. Given the movement of Wadjarri into this area, a people with whom the Yiongkarta maintained strong links, the young mix the two vocabularies. Country The Yingkarta's lands, lying between the Gascoyne and River Wooramel rivers in a wedge of land separating those of the Tedei to their south, and of their northern neighbours the Mandi. Their inland extension, from the northern area of Shark Bay, ran as far east as the vicinity of Red Hill and Gascoyne Junction. Alan Dench also lists among their northern neighbours the Baiyungu, Maia, Tharrkari and Warriyangga, while stating the Malgana lay to their south, and the Wadjarri to their east. According to Norman Tindale's estimation, this territory covered about . } History of contact White colonial occupation of Yingkarta lands began in 1877 when the indigenous population was estimated to number some 2,000 people. Small-pox (moonnangno)was common among them. Social organisation and rites It is not known whether or not the Yinggarda had a section system. A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, writing in 1930, stated of them that: > In the case of the Ingarda tribe to the south of the Gascoyne River it was > impossible to determine if they really had or had not a section system. They > knew the names of the sections of the Maia and Warienga [Warriyangka] tribes > and every man claimed membership of a particular section. ... They might > once have had such a system which had broken down or they might merely be > trying to adapt themselves as well as possible to the social organisation of > the neighbouring tribes. When the data was collected in 1911, little was > remembered of their marriage systems and Alan Dench thinks it probable, > unlike many neighbouring tribes to their north, they did not have a > moieties. The Yingkarta were said by some early explorers to have practiced circumcision. However, they lie to the west of the circumcision line, was denied by a colonial observer in 1886 who was familiar with their language, and has been contested by modern descendants and scholars, who state that this was a practice of the Watjarri to their west. Since the Inggarda social bands contiguous with the Watjarri were known under the distinct hordal name of Kurudandi (perhaps surviving in the contemporary station toponym Coordewandy, Tindale suggested that while the Inggarda to the east had not adopted this rite, the western clans might have at some time taken up the practice as current among the Watjarri. The Nanda on the southern end of Shark Bay were much in fear of the Inggarda whom they regarded as highly proficient in the art of sorcery (boollia), which included the power to conjure up rain at will.

Typically former slaves or born into the families of former slaves, many black men had skills in cattle handling and headed West at the end of the Civil War. Though the industry generally treated black men equally to white men in terms of pay and responsibilities, discrimination persisted, though to a lesser extent than in other industries of the time. Background Nat Love (1854 ‚Äì 1921), an African-American cowboy and former slave. After the Reconstruction of the South after the American Civil War, freed slaves were still denied land ownership and other rights in many states, and about 20,000 Exodusters headed west to Kansas between 1879 and 1884, with smaller migrations to other Western states. Many trained under Mexican vaqueros, cattle-raising Native Americans, or their former masters; they then worked as ranch hands for wages equal to their white counterparts and offering more opportunities than existed for freemen in the South. Black men, typically former slaves, children of slaves, or working in plantations, and farms would have been exposed to kitchen work and stables as well. As early as 1770, regulations in Louisiana required two slaves to manage 100 head of cattle. White ranchers could even win competitions based on the cow- handling skills of the Black slaves in their possession. Initially, white ranchers referred to white workers as \\"cow hands,\\" with Black people in the same position referred to with the pejorative \\"cow boy.\\" Over time the term cowboy came to apply to anyone in the industry of herding cattle. Prior to the abolition of slavery, the cattle trade was considered to offer a high degree of relative freedom to slaves, who would be issued guns, often left unaccompanied on horseback for long stretches, and trusted to return. Free Black cattle drivers drove cattle from Kansas to areas including Atlanta, the Dakotas, and Canada, as well as New Mexico, Arizona, California and Oregon. Some freed slaves remained with their former masters as employees. As these areas became more settled and established more practical transportation networks, the era of migrant cattle ranching came to an end. Work Black cowhands were typically assigned to handle horses with poor temperaments and wild behaviors, a career known as horsebreaking. Other people in the cattle trade were trail cooks, which could earn extra money over other cowhands, regardless of race. Trail menus from black chefs included biscuits, sowbelly, beef, molasses, and coffee. Black chefs would also hunt deer and wild turkey between washing and kitchen cleaning duties. Black cowhands were also expected to perform on the trail, and expected to sing or to pack a musical instrument. Others would often serve as bodyguards or money transporters, which has been attributed to the unlikelihood of thieves searching a black man for large sums of money. Bose Ikard served as Charles Goodnight's banker for many years. Bill Pickett was credited with inventing bulldogging. There were also black women cowboys, though their numbers are unknown, as income was provided to a common household rather than to individual women. Women were unlikely to inherit a homestead or continue to work in ranching, as freemen and white ranchers were unlikely to work for a black woman. =Rodeos= Popularized across the United States in 1873 by Buffalo Bill Cody, Wild West shows showcased skills and characters of the Western United States in the form of a traveling performance including rodeo roping, Native American dances, and other acts. Among these traveling shows, African-American cowboy Jesse Stahl was famous for his saddle riding, a defining aspect of rodeos. Racism was common in rodeo competitions, and terms such as \\"harder to cover\\" could be used to mask racism in rodeo competitions under the guise that white riders had more difficult horses. Black rodeo riders would be compared to animals, given nicknames reflecting African animals and using animal metaphors not found in descriptions of white rodeo performers. In response to their treatment and Jim Crow laws, Black cowboys formed \\"soul circuits,\\" later organized as the Southwestern Colored Cowboys' Association, with the largest number of African-American cowboys participated in rural communities along the coast of Texas up to the 1940s. Discrimination Social life on the trail could be egalitarian, with white and black cowhands sharing sleeping quarters and even blankets. Though white and black cowhands were social equals on the trail, racist roles would be resumed in the presence of white women. Traveling trail hands leading a migration of cattle were typically low-paid at the time, though better paid in the northern states. Pay was typically negotiated per run, with large discrepancies between runs and among hires on the same run. Though Mexican ranchers often received less than a third of white hires, little evidence suggests black hires were paid less for this work than their white counterparts. However, black employees may have been worked harder and expected to work longer hours. Evidence suggests that many black cowhands took on additional labor, such as laundry, testing stream water, taking late night guard shifts, and being the first expected to take on rough horses. Despite the existence of many all-black trail outfits, black cowboys rarely attained rank higher than trail cook or chuckwagon. Regardless of ability, black men would be constrained by having to negotiate with white men who might refuse to respect the authority of a black trail leader. Denied opportunities to become a foreman or range manager, many black cowhands would train white counterparts, with others settling land with their own cattle. Traveling posed its own challenges to integration. Whereas saloons were typically segregated, whites and blacks could meet in the middle, but restaurants were socially regulated. Traveling black men would not be seated in town restaurants where black-only establishments had not been established, requiring black men to order food from the back door. Most black cowhands would purchase food and prepare it for themselves on the trail. Black men were banned outright from brothels, but welcome in gambling halls.

His preaching gained reputation, and in 1821 he was admitted as preacher at the Royal Court of Sweden. He was appointed vicar in three parishes in the Archdiocese of Uppsala in 1828, whereafter elevated to provost in 1840. At the time of the Coronation of King Oscar I of Sweden in 1844, he was promoted to Doctor of Theology. Literature Already in 1814 he won the Grand Prize of the Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg, its highest prize, for the work Aphrodite. The same year, he was admitted to the Poetisk Kalender of Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom. Around the time of his initiation to the presbytariate, he published Skapelsen i s√•nger (1820), which however was not well met by the critics. In 1846 he published the historic play Erik den fjortonde, reportedly the first modern historical play in Sweden, which was set up on scene with pleased reviews. After this followed plays like Erik den fjortondes son (1847), Solen sjunker, Gustaf I:s sista dagar (1856), Ur Karl XII:s ungdom (1858), Br√∂draskulden, and Erik den Fjortonde, senare avdelningen (1861). He also resumed his lyrical writings; in 1849 K√§rlek och poesi was anonymously published, in 1854 Blommor och t√•rar p√• en dotters grav, the latter after the death of his daughter Amanda. B√∂rjesson had just finished another play, En sammansv√§rjning i Rom, including his very last poem Afsked till publiken och kritiken, when he died in the spring of 1866.

Early life Eddison was born in Yokohama, the youngest of four sons, the twins Robert and Talbot Leadam Eddison being born in 1908. However his father, Edwin Eddison, a civil engineer died when he was six months old, and his mother, Hilda Muriel Leadham returned to England with her young family by way of Canada. Although her family came from Leeds, she settled in Haywards Heath and Roger attended Charterhouse School followed by Pembroke College, Cambridge. Second World War At the outbreak of the Second World War Eddison joined the Army and was commissioned in the Royal Artillery and was then sent to the Royal Military College of Science where he served as a Technical Officer. He attained the rank of Major and title Chief Inspector of Fuses. It was in this period he became interested in statistics. Following the Second World War, Eddison first went to the Rothamsted Experimental Station, where he worked as a statistician with Frank Yates.

It belonged to a subgenre of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Trotskyism known as Archeio-Marxism (Archive-Marxism), and appears to have been the last scion of that ideology, the sole Archio-Marxist remnant of the 1950s. Dimitris Giotopoulos (ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒ∑œÇ ŒìŒπœâœÑœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ), often known by his primary alias \\"Witte\\", was the leader of KAKE. Before its formation, he had been a leader of the Greek Archio-Marxists, which had been one of the by far largest dissident communist movements in Greece during the early-to-mid-1930s, as members of Leon Trotsky's \\"Left Opposition\\". KAKE split from Trotsky's movement in 1934 after significant ideological fallout. It eventually joined the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre, known as the \\"London Bureau\\". The party participated in the 1936 Greek legislative election, with Har. Alexopoulos (ŒßŒ±œÅ. ŒëŒªŒµŒæœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ) as its formal party leader, where it won 1,148 votes ‚Äì roughly 0.1% of the vote.

During World War II and the later the Greek Civil War, KAKE feuded with the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) on matters of policy and theory. Many KAKE members were purged and executed by the Greek People's Liberation Army. It increasingly began to collaborate with the right-wing as a result, allying with the forces of anti-communism. Its final activities came with the 1951 Greek legislative election, where it received likewise negative results as back in 1936, after which it promptly dissolved. After his return from French exile in the 1950s, the long-time leader Dimitris Giotopoulos became a collaborator of the right-wing regime, cooperating in anti-communist activities. His son Alexandros Giotopoulos, disillusioned with his father's anti-communism, became a notorious left-wing terrorist, active as an armed militant in the ranks of the 17 November terrorist group between 1969 and 2002.

Benjamin (born 1976) is the Senator for the 30th District of the New York Senate. He serves as the Senior Assistant Majority Leader of the Senate.https://www.nysenate.gov/senate-leadership He is a Democrat. The district Benjamin represents includes parts of the neighborhoods of East Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Harlem, Morningside Heights, the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side, Washington Heights and Yorkville in Manhattan. Life and career Brian was born at Harlem Hospital in 1976. Benjamin was born to Caribbean immigrant parents before attending Brown University and later Harvard Business School. He later went on to work in finance, serve as the Richmond Field Director in Terry McAuliffe‚Äôs gubernatorial campaign and interned in the office of Bill Lynch & Associates. In 2012, he served as a delegate for President Barack Obama and as a member of President Obama‚Äôs National Finance Committee. Formerly, he served as the Chair of Community Board #10 in Manhattan, where he fought alongside residents of Lenox Terrace against a redevelopment plan. He is an alumni-elected trustee of Brown. Benjamin attends First Corinthian Baptist Church. Benjamin spent three years at Morgan Stanley working as an investment banker in asset wealth management. There he advised nonprofit and for profit organizations and individuals on the allocation of hundreds of millions of dollars and worked in the division which issued and underwrote bond. In 2010, Brian Benjamin became a managing partner at Genesis, a Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise building affordable housing in Harlem. Heavily involved in the purchase and redevelopment of deteriorating buildings from Abyssinian Development Corporation, Benjamin helped ensure that redevelopment and repair would be done with as many M/WBE partners and vendors as possible. Of the 100% affordable and environmentally sustainable apartments that resulted from the project, 20% where put aside for the homeless, and 5% for disabled New Yorkers. He was also heavily involved with partnerships with First Corinthians Baptist Church, which he is an active member of, in creating the Dream Center on 119th and the Hope Center on 114th. = Support for Barack Obama = Having been an admirer of Barack Obama since hearing the then senator speak at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, Benjamin became an early supporter of Obama when he announced his presidential campaign in 2007. He was a co-founder of ‚ÄúHarlem4Obama‚Äù which helped encourage Harlem support for the Senator and hosted a large fundraiser for the Obama in 2008. After Obama's election, the infrastructure of ‚ÄúHarlem4Obama‚Äù contributed to Benjamin's organization ‚ÄúYoung Professionals United for Change (YP4C),‚Äù which instituted a mentoring program at Wadleigh School and organized young people. In 2012, Benjamin was an Obama Delegate to the Democratic National Convention, and raised money for Obama's reelection as a member of his Young Professionals Finance Committee. New York Senate  In 2017, Senator Bill Perkins announced that he would run for a vacant seat on the New York City Council, that had become vacant when Inez Dickens resigned to take a seat in the New York Assembly. Following Perkins' subsequent victory for the vacant Council seat, Benjamin announced that he would run to succeed Perkins in the Senate. Because New York Law provides that Democratic Nominee in certain special elections is determined by the County Committee instead of a primary election, Benjamin was elected with 63% of the votes at a convention in March. Critics alleged that the process was controlled by Benjamin's allies, including Manhattan Democratic Party chairman and political insiders as the Democratic candidate, though Benjamin's principal opponent, Rev. Al Taylor, was endorsed by the incumbent Senator and senior members of the legislature. Benjamin's candidacy was endorsed by numerous elected officials including, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York City Public Advocate Letitia James, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, Former Congressman Charles B. Rangel, Congressman Jerrold Nadler, Assemblywoman Inez Dickens, Assemblyman Robert Rodriguez, Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, New York City Councilman Mark Levine, Assemblyman Denny Farrell, Former Assemblyman Keith Wright, Former New York City Councilman Robert Jackson, Hazel Dukes, Rev. Calvin Butts, and labor unions including 1199SEIU, 32BJ, and his mother's union, Local 372 of DC37. With the seat being overwhelmingly Democratic, Benjamin defeated Republican Dawn Simmons and Reform candidate Ruben Dario Vargas with over 91% of the vote, which had a very low turnout of 4%.https://www.wnyc.org/story/single- digit-turnout-uptown-special-election/ He was sworn into the seat on June 5, 2017.https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/new- york/2017/06/05/ny-senates-democratic-divide-deepens/102526022/ = 2017-2018 Session = One of Benjamin's first campaign promises was to fight for the closure of Rikers Island, and his bill to close Rikers in three years was one of the first he introduced. After violence on Rikers on Thanksgiving Day 2017, Benjamin sent a letter to the State Commission of Correction requesting a report on the state of the facility, a report which found that the City's inaction and protracted ten year proposal might require the Commission to examine steps to close Rikers faster to ensure that the constitutional rights of inmates and staff are protected. In addition to his bill to close Rikers Island , Benjamin was also a co-sponsor of historic bills to reform discovery, end cash bail, restore the voting rights of parolees, and end solitary confinement, many of which passed once the Democrats retook the majority. During his campaign for the State Senate, Benjamin mounted a campaign against the disrespectful rebranding of Harlem as SOHA by real estate forms. After his election, he sponsored a bill, the Neighborhood Integrity Act, to prohibit renaming neighborhoods or redefining traditional boundaries without community input. With pressure from the community rising, the real estate company dropped the SoHa rebranding effort. During his campaign, Benjamin accepted $2,500 in campaign contributions from a real estate company that owned a South Harlem condominium called ‚ÄúSoHa 118.‚Äù Once he learned they used the term ‚ÄúSoHa‚Äù he returned the donation and asked that they change the name. Benjamin, formerly served ranking member of the Civil Service and Pensions Committee is the sponsor of a bill to divest New York's Public Pension fund from private prisons. This bill helped push Comptroller da Napoli, the sole fiduciary of the fund, to divest. = 2019-2020 Session = With the Democrats retaking the majority in November 2018, Benjamin was named Chairman of Committee on Revenue and Budget. In this new position he continued to bring his expertise in financial management to his work to divest public and private banks from private for-profit prisons, sponsoring a bill that would push New York State chartered banks, which include many international banks that use New York State chartered to operate in the US, to stop investments. This bill passed the Senate in the 2019 and 2020 sessions, and was part of a nation-wide movement that pushed many of the largest private banking institutions to drop their investments. The Washington Post reported that Benjamin's legislation was key in getting Bank of America to drop their investments. The 2019 also saw the passage of long awaited housing reform legislation, including Benjamin's bill to protect keep Rent Stabilized apartments affordable, an important goal for parts of the 30th Senate district. This and other bills Benjamin co-sponsored where passed as a package entitled the Housing Stability And Tenant Protections Act of 2019. In the 2020 session Benjamin sponsored and passed the Rainy Day Fund bill, a piece of legislation that allowed New York City to set aside funds in a revenue stabilization fund. Legislation enacted after past fiscal crises had required the city to balance its budget, making such savings impossible, and so the city was required to cut essential services in times of financial stress. As a result of historic support for police reform, Benjamin also was able to legislation he had been championing for years including his bill the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act.  Controversies  After Success Academy Charter School chairman Dan Loeb said that State Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins had done \\"more damage to people of color than anyone who has ever donned a hood,\\" at a protest outside a Success Academy Charter School Senator Benjamin said that the lack of serious response from founder Eva Moskowitz was not enough. In 2017, when Benjamin was a managing partner of a real estate firm and on the verge of becoming the New York State Senate Democratic nominee, his firm was involved in a legal dispute over an alleged scheme to divert revenue from a fire sale initiated by the real estate firm. The affordable-housing firm that specializes in preserving low-income housing denied all of the allegations and the case went to arbitration. After his election to New York State Senate, reports claimed that his former real estate company allegedly retained Benjamin as an advisor for $60,000 a year in addition to his annual $75,000 as a New York State Senator. Senator Benjamin has repeatedly denied receiving any outside income since his election, which was supported by 2018 filings with the Joint Commission on Public Ethics. In 2018, Benjamin urged constituents to keep warm during cold months while serving on the advisory board of his former real estate company which accrued hundreds of violations, though the company and city officials maintain the issues existed prior to the company's involvement. He directed tenants to ‚Äúcontact his office about heat-related issues,‚Äù and ‚Äúbragged about holding landlords accountable.‚Äù A grassroots non- profit organization that actively solicited public donations was allegedly reported to have been a front for a group of Harlem elected officials. A flyer organizing a free bus trip to a conference organized by the New York State Association of Black and Puerto Rican legislators with the organization's name on it featured a picture of four Harlem Black and Puerto Rican legislators including Benjamin. In 2014, Benjamin appeared in Oprah Winfrey Network's television show ‚ÄúLove in the City‚Äù as a devoted boyfriend of breast-cancer victim and entrepreneur Tiffany Jones.

Initially influenced by Fr√©d√©ric Le Play, he broke up with him and created a school called Social Science. His disciple and friend Edmond Demolins founded the famous √âcole des Roches near Verneuil-sur-Avre. Life Born in Paris on 19 March 1842, he was trained in the catholic seminary of Issy-les-Moulineaux and in the law school of the Sorbonne university in Paris. He always had a poor health and dedicated most of his life to writing from his family estate of Tourville, where he had to retire after only a few years of work as a priest in Paris. There he would also receive and counsel his many disciples and friends. He wrote only one book but developed his thinking through an extremely abundant correspondence. He died in Tourville castle on 5 March 1903. Thought = Social science = Herri de Tourville opened a new era in social research when he developed a tool allowing for the analysis and classification of observations about a social group, which was published in 1886 under the name of \\"social facts nomenclature\\". This \\"nomenclature\\" includes 25 major categories and over a hundred sub-categories relevant to localisation, wealth, income, education and religion. Going beyond the mere economic characteristics used by Le Play Henri de Tourville emphasized the ¬´ geographical space‚Äôs constraints ¬ª and their impact of individuals or social groups.Fr√©d√©ric Parent, ¬´ L'√âcole de la Science sociale et l'√âcole durkheimienne de sociologie. Remarques √† propos de psychologie collective et d'espace social ¬ª, Les √âtudes Sociales 2010/1 (n¬∞ 151), 120 pages, DOI : 10.3917/etsoc.151.0011, √©diteur : Soci√©t√© d'√©conomie et de science sociales, pp. 11 √† 37 The \\"nomenclature\\" allowed comparisons of numerous elements (or variables) within a given society of even internationally which in turn generated hypothesis which could be tested and determine two types of relations: causality or coexistence. Tourville's school of thought became structured in 1904, shortly after his death, under the leadership of Paul de Rousiers who created the Soci√©t√© internationale de science sociale (SISS), In 1945, this society was merged with the Soci√©t√© internationale des √©tudes pratiques d‚Äô√©conomie sociale (SIEPES) which had been created by Fr√©d√©ric Le Play in 1856, and the new body became known as the Soci√©t√© d‚Äô√©conomie sociale et de science sociales (SESS).SESS‚Äô site, accessed on 29 July 2017 = Philosophy = Much like Joseph Gratry or Maine de Biran, Abb√© de Tourville's philosophy rests on a sociological and scientific basis associated with spiritual and metaphysical elements\\".Dominique Ottavi, Henri de Tourville et l‚Äô√©ducation particulariste, revue Le T√©l√©maque, 2008/1 (n¬∞ 33), √©diteur : Presses universitaires de Caen, 148 pages, In his numerous articles which were later bundled into a book, he described his theory of a partly mythical history of humankind, where Goth migrants would have come directly from Asia and settled on the western part of Scandinavia; having escaped any Greco-Roman influence and having gained a culture of migration led by strong leaders, the Germanic people would therefore have acquired a superior ability in terms of industrial and intellectual arts. This theory would trigger Paul Bureau's 1906 research on ‚Äúthe farmer of the Norwegian fjords\\",F. Audren (dir.), Paul Bureau (1865-1923) et la Science sociale, Les √âtudes sociales, no 141, 1er semestre 2005. which showed how the narrow and scattered farmable strips of land in the fjords‚Äô area led joint family structures to break up, and forced the migrants to get settled as nuclear families and to pass on their heritage to one only child. This was assumed to be the origin of the Anglo-Saxon race and of the stem family. In this framework, abb√© de Tourville studied property as well as moral transmission within families and turned his attention towards education matters. = \\"Particularist education\\" = In his reflection on education abb√© de Tourville developed the idea of \\"particularist education\\", but it remained a theoretical concept. His disciple Edmond Demolins, author of a noted book on \\"the origins of Anglo-Saxon superiority\\" would be the first to derive a concrete educational experience from it: the √âcole des Roches. \\"Particularist education\\" views the endemic authority crisis of its time as a reaction against the prevalent authoritarian catholic tradition. Henri de Tourville and Edmond Demolins think that the traditional morals and authority ethos will inexorably give way. Their refondation needs to go through the individual. Education can lead each individual to become autonomous. Self-control must replace control of the other. Particularist education will allow to combat the wild form of competition which is the hallmark of worldwide capitalism. It will allow to avoid social reproduction.Dominique Ottavi, Henri de Tourville philosophe, Les √âtudes sociales, no 141, 1er semestre 2005, Paul Bureau (1865-1923) et la Science sociale, F.

The Venetians promised to remain in the city to fight - a total of six Venetian vessels and three from the Venetian colony of Crete were retained in the harbour with the consent of their commanders, now turned into warships. On 28 April a battle broke out between Venetian and Genoese vessels on one side and Turkish ships on the other. Trevisano's galley was sunk by Turkish cannon-fire, and abandoned. At other times the Venetians and their allies won some minor naval skirmishes against the Turks. During the siege, Trevisano also commanded a Byzantine garrison at the Maiden's Tower.

It is one of the two main types of electromagnetic telegraph, the other being the armature system as exemplified by the telegraph of Samuel Morse in the United States. Needle telegraphs were widely used in Europe and the British Empire during the nineteenth century. Needle telegraphs were suggested shortly after Hans Christian √òrsted discovered that electric currents could deflect compass needles in 1820. Pavel Schilling developed a telegraph using needles suspended by threads. This was intended for installation in Russia for government use, but Schilling died in 1837 before it could be implemented. Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber built a telegraph that was used for scientific study and communication between university sites. Carl August von Steinheil adapted Gauss and Weber's rather cumbersome apparatus for use on various German railways. In England, William Fothergill Cooke started building telegraphs, initially based on Schilling's design. With Charles Wheatstone, Cooke produced a much improved design. This was taken up by several railway companies. Cooke's Electric Telegraph Company, formed in 1846, provided the first public telegraph service. The needle telegraphs of the Electric Telegraph Company and their rivals were the standard form of telegraphy for the better part of the nineteenth century in the United Kingdom. They continued in use even after the Morse telegraph became the official standard in the UK in 1870. Some were still in use well in to the twentieth century.  Early ideas  Schweigger multiplier The history of the needle telegraph began with the landmark discovery, published by Hans Christian √òrsted on 21 April 1820, that an electric current deflected the needle of a nearby compass.Fahie, p. 274 Almost immediately, other scholars realised the potential this phenomenon had for building an electric telegraph. The first to suggest this was French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace. On 2 October, Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re, acting on Laplace's suggestion, sent a paper on this idea to the Paris Academy of Sciences. Amp√®re's (theoretical) telegraph had a pair of wires for each letter of the alphabet with a keyboard to control which pair was connected to a battery. At the receiving end, Amp√®re placed small magnets (needles) under the wires. The effect on the magnet in Amp√®re's scheme would have been very weak because he did not form the wire into a coil around the needle to multiply the magnetic effect of the current.Fahie, pp. 302‚Äì303 Johann Schweigger had already invented the galvanometer (in September) using such a multiplier, but Amp√®re either had not yet got the news, or failed to realise its significance for a telegraph.Fahie, pp. 302‚Äì303 Peter Barlow investigated Amp√®re's idea, but thought it would not work. In 1824 he published his results, saying that the effect on the compass was seriously diminished \\"with only 200 feet of wire\\". Barlow, and other eminent academics of the time who agreed with him, were criticised by some writers for retarding the development of the telegraph. A decade passed between Amp√®re's paper being read and the first electromagnetic telegraphs being built.Fahie, pp. 302‚Äì307  Development  = Schilling telegraph = A Schilling needle instrument It was not until 1829 that the idea of applying Schweigger style multipliers to telegraph needles was mooted by Gustav Theodor Fechner in Leipzig. Fechner, in other respects following the scheme of Amp√®re, also suggested a pair of wires for each letter (twenty-four in the German alphabet) laid underground to connect Leipzig with Dresden. Fechner's idea was taken up by William Ritchie of the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1830. Ritchie used twenty-six pairs of wires run across a lecture room as a demonstration of principle.Fahie, pp. 303‚Äì305 Meanwhile, Pavel Schilling in Russia constructed a series of telegraphs also using Schweigger multipliers. The exact date that Schilling switched from developing electrochemical telegraphs to needle telegraphs is not known, but Hamel says he showed one in early development to Tsar Alexander I who died in 1825.Fahie, p. 309 In 1832, Schilling developed the first needle telegraph (and the first electromagnetic telegraph of any kind) intended for practical use.Yarotsky, p. 709 Tsar Nicholas I initiated a project to connect St. Petersburg with Kronstadt using Schilling's telegraph, but it was cancelled on Schilling's death in 1837.Huurdeman, p. 54 Schilling's scheme had some drawbacks. Although it used far fewer wires than proposed by Amp√®re or used by Ritchie, his 1832 demonstration still used eight wires, which made the system expensive to install over very long distances. Schilling's scheme used a bank of six needle instruments which between them displayed a binary code representing a letter of the alphabet. Schilling did devise a code that allowed the letter code to be sent serially to a single needle instrument, but he found that the dignitaries he demonstrated the telegraph to could understand the six-needle version more readily.Yarotsky, p. 712 Transmission speed was very slow on the multi-needle telegraph, perhaps as low as four characters per minute, and even slower on the single-needle version. The reason for this was principally that Schilling had severely overdamped the movement of the needles by slowing them with a platinum paddle in a cup of mercury.Dawson, p. 133 Schilling's method of mounting the needle by suspending it by a silk thread over the multiplier also had practical difficulties. The instrument had to be carefully levelled before use and could not be moved or disturbed while in use.Dawson, p. 129 = Gauss and Weber telegraph = In 1833 Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber set up an experimental needle telegraph between their laboratory in the University of G√∂ttingen and the university astronomical observatory about a mile and a half away where they were studying the Earth's magnetic field. The line consisted of a pair of copper wires on posts above rooftop height.Fahie, p. 320 The receiving instrument they used was a converted laboratory instrument, of which the so called needle was a large bar magnet weighing a pound. In 1834, they replaced the magnet with an even heavier one, variously reported as 25,Garratt, p. 275 30,Shaffner, p. 137 and 100 pounds.Fahie, p. 321 The magnet moved so minutely a telescope was required to observe a scale reflected from it by a mirror.Fahie, p. 322 The initial purpose of this line was not telegraphic at all. It was used to confirm the correctness or otherwise of the then recent work of Georg Ohm, that is, they were verifying Ohm's law. They quickly found other uses, the first of which was the synchronisation of clocks in the two buildings. Within a few months, they developed a telegraph code that allowed them to send arbitrary messages. Signalling speeds were around seven characters per minute.Garratt, p. 275 In 1835, they replaced the batteries of their telegraph with a large magneto-electric apparatus which generated telegraph pulses as the operator moved a coil relative to a bar magnet. This machine was made by Carl August von Steinheil.Fahie, pp. 320‚Äì321 The Gauss and Weber telegraph remained in daily service until 1838.Fahie, p. 325 In 1836, the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway inquired whether the Gauss and Weber telegraph could be installed on their line. The laboratory instrument was much too cumbersome, and much too slow to be used in this way. Gauss asked Steinheil to develop something more practical for railway use. This he did, producing a compact needle instrument which also emitted sounds while it was receiving messages. The needle struck one of two bells, on the right and left respectively, when it was deflected. The two bells had different tones so that the operator could tell which way the needle had been deflected without constantly watching it.Garratt, p. 275 Steinheil first installed his telegraph along five miles of track covering four stations around Munich.Garratt, p. 275 In 1838, he was installing another system on the Nuremberg‚ÄìF√ºrth railway line. Gauss suggested that he should use the rails as conductors and entirely avoid installing wires. This failed when Steinheil tried it because the rails were not well insulated from the ground, but in the process of this failure, he realised that he could use the ground as one of the conductors. This was the first earth-return telegraph put into service anywhere.Garratt, pp. 275‚Äì276  Commercial use  = Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph = Cooke and Wheatstone five-needle telegraph The most widely used needle system, and the first telegraph of any kind used commercially, was the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, employed in Britain and the British Empire in the 19th and early-20th centuries, due to Charles Wheatstone and William Fothergill Cooke. The inspiration to build a telegraph came in March 1836 when Cooke saw one of Schilling's needle instruments demonstrated by Georg Wilhelm Muncke in a lecture in Heidelberg (although he did not realise that the instrument was due to Schilling).Kieve, pp. 17-18 Cooke was supposed to be studying anatomy, but immediately abandoned this and returned to England to develop telegraphy. He initially built a three-needle telegraph, but believing that needle telegraphs would always require multiple wires,Shaffner, p. 187 he moved to mechanical designs.Shaffner, pp. 178‚Äì184 His first effort was a clockwork telegraph alarm, which later went into service with telegraph companies.Shaffner, p. 185 He then invented a mechanical telegraph based on a musical snuff box. In this device the detent of the clockwork mechanism was released by the armature of an electromagnet.Shaffner, pp. 185‚Äì190 Cooke carried out this work extremely quickly. The needle telegraph was completed within three weeks, and the mechanical telegraph within six weeks of seeing Muncke's demonstration.Shaffner, p. 185 Cooke attempted to interest the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in his mechanical telegraph for use as railway signalling, but it was rejected in favour of a system using steam whistles. Unsure of how far his telegraph could be made to work, Cooke consulted Michael Faraday and Peter Mark Roget. They put him in touch with eminent scientist Charles Wheatstone and the two then worked in partnership.Shaffner, pp. 190‚Äì191 Wheatstone suggested using a much improved needle instrument and they then developed a five-needle telegraph.Kieve, pp. 17-18 The Cooke and Wheatstone five-needle telegraph was a substantial improvement on the Schilling telegraph. The needles instruments were based on the galvanometer of Macedonio Melloni.Hubbard, p. 39 They were mounted on a vertical board with the needles centrally pivoted. The needles could be directly observed and Schilling's delicate silk threads were entirely done away with. The system required five wires, a slight reduction on that used by Schilling, partly because the Cooke and Wheatstone system did not require a common wire. Instead of Schilling's binary code, current was sent through one wire to one needle's coil and returned via the coil and wire of another.Shaffner, pp. 199‚Äì206 This scheme was similar to that employed by Samuel Thomas von S√∂mmerring on his chemical telegraph, but with a much more efficient coding scheme. S√∂mmerring's code required one wire per character.Fahie, pp. 230‚Äì233 Even better, the two needles energised were made to point to a letter of the alphabet. This allowed the apparatus to be used by unskilled operators without the need to learn a code ‚Äì a key selling point to the railway companies the system was aimed at.Kieve, p. 49 Another advantage was that it was much faster at 30 characters per minute.Shaffner, p. 207 It did not use heavy mercury as the damping fluid, but instead used a vane in air, a much better match for ideal damping.Dawson, pp. 133‚Äì134 The five-needle telegraph was first put into service with the Great Western Railway in 1838.Bowers, p. 129 However, it was soon dropped in favour of two-needle and single-needle systems. The cost of multiple wires proved to be a more important factor than the cost of training operators.Garratt, p. 277 In 1846, Cooke formed the Electric Telegraph Company with John Lewis Ricardo, the first company to offer a telegraph service to the public.Kieve, p. 31 They continued to sell needle telegraph systems to railway companies for signalling, but they also slowly built a national network for general use by businesses, the press, and the public.Kieve, pp. 44‚Äì45, 49 Needle telegraphs were officially superseded by the Morse telegraph when the UK telegraph industry was nationalised in 1870,Kieve, p. 176 but some continued in use well in to the twentieth century.Huurdeman, pp. 67‚Äì69 = Other systems = Henley-Foster telegraph instrument The Henley-Foster telegraph was a needle telegraph used by the British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company, the main rival to the Electric Telegraph Company. It was invented in 1848 by William Thomas Henley and George Foster. It was made in both single-needle and two-needle forms which in operation were similar to the corresponding Cooke and Wheatstone instruments. The unique feature of this telegraph was that it did not require batteries. The telegraph pulses were generated by coils moving through a magnetic field as the operator worked the handles of the machine to send messages.Nature, pp. 111-112 The Henley-Foster instrument was the most sensitive instrument available in the 1850s. It could consequently be operated over a greater distance and worse quality lines than other systems.Schaffner, p. 288 The Foy-Breguet telegraph was invented by Alphonse Foy and Louis-Fran√ßois-Clement Breguet in 1842, and used in France. The instrument display was arranged to mimic the French optical telegraph system, with the two needles taking on the same positions as the arms of the Chappe semaphore (the optical system widely used in France). This arrangement meant that operators did not need to be retrained when their telegraph lines were upgraded to the electrical telegraph.Shaffner, pp. 331-332 The Foy- Breguet telegraph is usually described as a needle telegraph, but electrically it is actually a type of armature telegraph. The needles are not moved by a galvanometer arrangement. They are instead moved by a clockwork mechanism that the operator must keep wound up. The detent of the clockwork is released by an electromagnetic armature which operates on the edges of a received telegraph pulse.Shaffner, pp. 325‚Äì328 According to Stuart M. Hallas, needle telegraphs were in use on the Great Northern Line as late as the 1970s. The telegraph code used on these instruments was the Morse code. Instead of the usual dots and dashes of different durations, but the same polarity, needle instruments used pulses of the same duration, but opposite polarities to represent the two code elements.Hallas This arrangement was commonly used on needle telegraphs and submarine telegraph cables in the 19th century after Morse code became the international standard.Bright, pp. 604‚Äì606  Pseudoscience  Sympathetic needles were a supposed 17th century means of instantaneous communication at a distance using magnetised needles. Pointing one needle to a letter of the alphabet was supposed to cause its partner needle to point to the same letter at another location.Phillips, p. 271  References   Bibliography  * Bowers, Brian, Sir Charles Wheatstone: 1802‚Äì1875, IEE, 2001 . * Bright, Charles, Submarine Telegraphs, London: Crosby Lockwood, 1898 . * Dawson, Keith, \\"Electromagnetic telegraphy: early ideas, proposals and apparatus\\", pp. 113‚Äì142 in, Hall, A.

Originally founded in 1994, LVEJO's mission is to achieve environmental justice in the Little Village area of Chicago. LVEJO's work is centered around working with the community and aims to address the root of environmental issues.  Establishment  LVEJO was originally founded in 1994. During that summer, Gary Elementary School was refurbishing the windows as well as re-tarring the roof. While this work was going on, students were having asthma attacks, fainting, and were exposed to lead poisoning. Parents and community members organized and were able to have the work moved to the night. The success at Gary Elementary led them to create the Little Village Environmental Justice Project, known today as LVEJO.  Accomplishments  = Fisk and Crawford Power Plants Shutdown = LVEJO protesting the Fisk and Crawford Power Plants LVEJO was part of a coalition of environmental groups who advocated for the closure of two power plants. Their goal was to gather enough signatures to get a referendum on the 2003 ballot. The referendum asked for an ordinance that required Fisk and Crawford to reduce pollution by 90% by 2006 or permanently shut down. The groups accused the two power plants of increasing asthma rates and other health problems. A 2002 Harvard School of Public Health study looked at the impact that pollution from the Fisk and Crawford coal plants had on health. The study linked pollution from the plants to 41 premature deaths, 550 emergency room visits, 2,800 asthma attacks and 36,000 minor restricted activity days. The National Research Council found that pollution from the power plants cost the surrounding areas $127 million in hidden health costs. On February 28, 2012, it was announced that both power plants would be shut down. = Public Transit = Little Village has a high demand and little access to public transit. In 1997, the 31st Street bus route was canceled for low ridership leaving Little Village residents with only two bus lines. LVEJO's efforts resulted in the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) extending the 35th Street bus route to include 31st Street between Kedzie and Cicero in summer 2012. It was announced by CTA president Dorval Carter Jr. that the Lincoln Avenue and 31st Street bus routes would come back on a trial basis in 2016. However, supporters of the routes believe that the trial bus schedule was designed to ensure that it fails to meet the ridership requirements. = Reclaiming Green Space =  La Villita Park  In 2010, Little Village was ranked as second to last in Chicago neighborhoods in terms of access to open space. After years of community desires for more open space, the first park built in Little Village in over 75 years officially opened in December 2014. On a plot of land that was previously the Celotox asphalt factory, the 22 acre park is the city's largest brownfield conversion to date. It also doubled the amount of open space in Little Village. The park contains two soccer fields, two basketball courts, two baseball fields, a skate park and a playground.  Semillas de Justicia  In 2012, LVEJO began creating a community garden on a plot of remediated brownfield. The garden was named Semillas de Justicia (Seeds of Justice). A goal of the garden was to give community members a place to grow organic food that they can no longer afford and to bring the Little Village community together. As of October 2017, there are approximately thirty residential gardeners that work on the garden. LVEJO hosts a variety of events on the garden such as an annual Harvest Fest, weekly community dinners, art classes, and educational workshops.  Active Campaigns  = 31st Street Collateral Channel = With the success of La Villita Park, LVEJO has focused on the pollution coming from the 31st Street Collateral Channel. The water in the channel is contaminated with heavy metals and sewage that create toxic bubbles that release methane. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago have found high levels of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the water. Although there have been proposals to redevelop the area, LVEJO believes that the environmental hazards must be dealt with first.

It is particularly applicable to U.S. contexts. According to the 2018 Oxford Bibliography entry on Afro-pessimism written by Patrice Douglass, Selamawit D. Terrefe, and Frank B. Wilderson III, Afro-pessimism can be understood as ‚Äúa lens of interpretation that accounts for civil society‚Äôs dependence on anti- black violence‚Äîa regime of violence that positions black people as internal enemies of civil society.‚Äù This violence, they argue, ‚Äúcannot be analogized with the regimes of violence that disciplines the Marxist subaltern, the postcolonial subaltern, the colored but nonblack Western immigrant, the nonblack queer, or the nonblack woman.‚Äù According to Wilderson, the scholar who coined the term as it functions most popularly today, Afro-pessimism theorizes blackness as a position of, using the language of scholar Saidiya Hartman, \\"accumulation and fungibility\\"; that is, as a condition of‚Äîor relation to‚Äîontological death, as opposed to a cultural identity or human subjectivity. As opposed to humanist anthropologists, historians, sociologists, and political scientists who engage the history of Black subjectivity as one of entrenched political discrimination and social ostracization, afro-pessimists across disciplines have argued that Black people are constitutively excluded from the category of the self-possessing, rights-bearing human being of modernity. As Wilderson writes, ‚ÄúBlacks do not function as political subjects; instead, our flesh and energies are instrumentalized for postcolonial, immigrant, feminist, LGBT, and workers‚Äô agendas.‚Äù Orlando Patterson's Slavery and Social Death forms a theoretical point of departure for almost all strands of Afropessimism. In an interview of the Kerner Report, Patterson had this to say about Afropessimism: > We‚Äôre going through a period of extreme despair about the situation of > African-Americans. The most extreme form of this despair is a movement > called Afro-pessimism, which holds that black Americans are still viewed as > they were viewed in the slavery days as different, inferior, and as > outsiders.

Born an Arab Muslim, he became fascinated by Zionism and eventually converted to Judaism. Biography Baruch Mizrahi, son of Mahmoud and Fatima, was born Hamuda Abu Al-Anyan to a well-known nationalistic family from Safed. At a young age, he became interested in his Jewish neighbors and eventually approached Betar members in Safed who had gathered at the HaMeiri Dairy. He was intrigued by their way of life and stories of heroism. At one point he left the Arab government school in Safed and went to study at the local Jewish school, despite opposition from his family. Hamuda, who was the only Arab student in a Jewish school, was accepted by the Jewish students, including future member of the Knesset, Avner Shaki. When his mother died, his relationship with his father deteriorated. Hamuda soon left the house and moved to Haifa, determined to convert to Judaism. He underwent the conversion process, becoming known as Avraham ben Avraham. Later on, after joining the Irgun, he took on the name Baruch Mizrahi. Shortly after joining the Betar branch in Haifa, Mizrahi joined the Irgun and took part in activities against the British. During one of the operations, he was apprehended and sent to the Latrun detention camp. He was held there for several months, until he was sent along with 55 other Etzel and Lehi exiles to Eritrea. When they didn't allow him to take anything, he insisted on taking a tallit and tefillin. About three weeks after arriving in Eritrea, Mizrahi was severely injured by the Sudanese guards, in an incident where two detainees were killed and 12 were wounded. He was operated on for 24 hours by a British doctor and survived. Later on, his friend Danny Meterscu, told him with amusement that after receiving 20 doses of English blood, he was no longer Jewish. Only after realizing it was a joke, did Mizrahi, whose new identity as a Jew and a Zionist was so important to him, relax. He later took part in attempts to escape the detention camps. After two years of exile in Africa, Baruch Mizrahi was suddenly released, returned to Palestine and became very active in the Irgun, later joining a group of Jewish Brigade veterans who established the Margolin outpost near Beit Lid Junction, Nordia. He continued to carry out intelligence activities within the framework of the Arab Department of the Irgun, and on April 18, 1948, he was sent to an intelligence gathering in preparation for an operation in Jenin. While on- route to Jenin from Haifa, they were stopped for routine inspection in the Megiddo area. The Arab policeman at the checkpoint identified Mizrahi by the golden tooth in his mouth, and he along with three Arabs he had met during the journey, were brought before the Kaukji court in Jaba. His fate was not known at the time, and he was declared absent until 1968. Aftermath After the Six-Day War, journalist Yehezkel Hameiri began to investigate the fate of Baruch Mizrahi. He went to the village of Jaba near Nablus, heard from the locals about \\"the Jew\\" executed by soldiers of Kaukji and eventually arrived at the cave Mizrahi was buried. During the search, the body of the three executed Arabs were found buried with Mizrahi, who was identified by the structure of his teeth and golden tooth. On October 9, 1969, Baruch Mizrahi was buried with full military honors as a Jew in the military section of the Netanya cemetery. Among the escorts was Menachem Begin and Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren. Beginning in 2015, the Shomron Regional Council began organizing annual pilgrimages to Mizrahi's grave on the anniversary of his death.

Medford formed the band in San Francisco in October 1984 and disbanded the quartet in September 1989. The band was signed twice, first by Strange Weekend Records for one album, then by Rough Trade Records, for whom they produced 2 albums and an EP. The Ophelias recorded music that was described as \\"original\\" and \\"incredibly diverse\\" and \\"a sound that can alternate from raunchy to sweet in seconds.\\" Leslie Medford's lyrics were \\"impressively literate\\" and J. F. Tiger described The Ophelias as \\"musical literature in an era practically devoid of such a thing‚Ä¶ this band makes the listener think, and takes the listener into a secret world where other 'new music' dares not go.\\" Medford was an unusually versatile lead vocalist, who \\"isn't shy about forcing his chameleon voice into Beefhearty growls, flowery Daltry-Townshend falsettos and strained Marc Bolan-David Bowie brays.\\" They have been compared to Pink Floyd, Mark Bolan and T-Rex, Faces, The Zombies, Van der Graaf Generator, Frank Zappa, Queen and XTC, although Nils Berstein wrote \\"Let's just say the Ophelias have no influences.\\" David Fricke argued in Rolling Stone that The Ophelias were one of the only genuinely psychedelic bands of the 1980s. \\"In the Sixties, psychedelia wasn't just a sound; it was a state of mind. The biggest drag about Eighties psychedelia is that for every dozen bands that talk about blowing minds (reciting the proper influences, trotting out the hip covers), there are really only one or two that can blow anything other than hot air. The Ophelias, from (where else?) San Francisco, belong to that delightfully manic minority.\\" David Immergl√ºck was the Ophelias lead guitarist from 1987 to 1989, the period of the band's greatest exposure. He is the band's best-known alumnus having gone on to membership in Counting Crows, John Hiatt, Camper van Beethoven, Cracker and others, as well as session work, studio production and music engineering.  History  Virginia-born Stanford graduate, guitarist and vocalist Leslie Medford played over 150 solo gigs between 1982 and 1984 as prelude to forming The Ophelias in San Francisco in October 1984. Most notably he had provided support for Violent Femmes on their late 1983 Bay Area dates and gained high approbation from that band for his Syd Barrett covers and like-minded original material. Boston transplant Sam Babbitt was the first to join, winning out over approximately 20 guitarists who auditioned for Medford. By December bassist Terry von Blankers who was attending the San Francisco Art Institute, and Florida-born drummer Rueben Chandler ‚Äì both acquaintances of Babbitt‚Äôs - completed the four-piece line-up. After submitting a 3-song rehearsal cassette, in March 1985 The Ophelias garnered the only Perfect Ten rating ever awarded by the Demo Derby column in the San Francisco Music Calendar magazine. In May 1985 The Ophelias hired the Tom Mallon Studio in San Francisco to record three songs on 8-track reel-to-reel. Their renowned version of ‚ÄúMister Rabbit‚Äù was one of these, and all three would be included on The Ophelias first album. The band‚Äôs first personnel change happened shortly after the Tom Mallon-engineered session, before the band‚Äôs first public performance. Indiana transplant Geoffrey Armour (ex-MX80 Sound) replaced Reuben Chandler on drums. Despite being San Francisco based, no Californian-born musician would join The Ophelias until Edward Benton in July 1987. \\"Mister Rabbit\\" The Ophelias eccentric version of the anti- discrimination folk song \\"Mister Rabbit\\" appeared on SF Unscene ‚Äì a 1985 compilation album. It received positive notice in Spin Magazine (May 1986) and other publications. It brought with it the first major exposure for the group, not just locally but nationally as \\"Mister Rabbit\\" was quickly embraced by university and underground radio stations around the country. The zenith of the buzz surrounding the track came in May 1986 when Spin Magazine reviewed SF Unscene and specifically \\"Mister Rabbit\\" with a double exposure photograph captioned: \\"Leslie Medford of The Ophelias makes like a nun.\\" David Immergluck, who would join The Ophelias a year later saw the band for the first time in early 1986. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd heard ‚ÄúMister Rabbit‚Äù on KALX and KUSF and liked it, but seeing them live up close blew me right away! Leslie‚Äôs stage presence, and the whole bands‚Äô, just resonated with me, reminding me immediately of the audaciousness of so many particularly British Glam/Psych/Prog bands I‚Äôd grown up with. An aesthetic that was sorely lacking in the Bay Area music scene of the time, so I was seriously thrilled to find a new band to call my own! I distinctly remember being down front as they played a nascent version of ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs A Bell‚Äù and staring up at Terry von Blankers as he hit the final harmony thinking this was the closest I was ever gonna get to seeing Ziggy era Bowie.‚Äù  The Ophelias  The band's debut album was released by Strange Weekend Records in March 1987. The Ophelias entered the KUSF Top 20 at number 4 the first week of April 1987. Dave Marrs wrote in Beef Free Magazine, \\"The Ophelias have delivered a tour de force with their debut. Perhaps the best independent album to come out of San Francisco in recent years, this album is brilliant.\\" College Music Journal (New York) ran a review which ended, \\"What finally emerges is a mesh of the ephemeral mystery of Bolan and Donovan, with a weird, confident modernism that makes them a leading contender.\\" By this time, the band's live shows were already receiving rave reviews. Joni Hollar of the Daily Californian wrote: \\"I've seen The Ophelias three times now, twice in the last few days, and they are just amazing. [...] The Ophelias are fortunate in several respects: the musicians do new things with the music yet retain a certain warped traditionalism, they are accomplished enough to play around with a multitude of styles, and they have a particularly strong singer/songwriter. These forces will, I think, combine fortuitously to make The Ophelias well-known beyond the local scene. Lately, the only bands I notice are the ones who don't fit into any specific genre, whose music is so original that hearing them is like hearing a completely new way of playing.\\"  The Night of Halloween  The Ophelias became one of the first signees to the US wing of Rough Trade Records and released The Night of Halloween ‚Äì a 3-song EP ‚Äì in August 1987. The Hard Report (an 80s era radio industry journal) wrote \\"Their sweeping debut album is still planted firmly in the minds of alternative programmers but it looks like they are at it again. The daring arrangements, biting acoustics and dazzling creativity continue as San Francisco's Ophelias carve a spectacular niche in the underground community.\\" The EP included a Kinks song, ‚ÄúWicked Annabella‚Äù from The Village Green Preservation Society album. There has been an absolute outpouring of Kinks covers in recent years, but such things were very rare in the 1970s and 1980s, making The Ophelias version much remarked upon, several publications calling it the best Kinks cover ever. Medford has often stated that The Kinks were the band most influential on his becoming a musician.  Oriental Head  Oriental Head is a 10-song LP released by Rough Trade Records in May 1988. The record received Top 35 airplay at 159 radio stations around the USA, reached the Top 10 at 48 stations, and reached Number 1 at 9 radio stations. WODU Norfolk, VA; WDCR Hanover, NH; WMMR Minneapolis, MN; WUOG Athens, GA; WRUV Burlington, VT; KTEQ Rapid City, SD; WPRB Princeton, NJ; KMUW Wichita, KS; KUSF, San Francisco, CA. Ann Powers wrote that they \\"get down harder and in a more straightforward way than on their previous recordings,\\" and the songs \\"recall the glory days of satin pants rock and roll\\". Immergl√ºck recalled, \\"When the record came out shortly thereafter, on an excellent and storied label, no less, I was just on top of the world. Honestly, it's still one of my favourite albums I‚Äôve ever made! I really believed (and still may) we‚Äôd made the BEST album to come out of the SF Bay Area since \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\", Santana's \\"Abraxas\\", Quicksilver's \\"Happy Trails\\", Skip Spence's \\"Oar\\", or Garcia's first solo album.\\"  The Big O  A 12-song LP released in March 1989 on Rough Trade Records, The Big O received Top 35 airplay at 136 radio stations around the USA, reached the Top 10 at 29 stations, and reached Number 1 at 5 radio stations. WCWM Williamsburg, VA; WVKR Poughkeepsie, NY; WLFT East Lansing, MI; WWUH West Hartford, CT.; KCPR San Luis Obispo, CA. The record was reviewed in both Spin and Rolling Stone, where David Fricke described the record as \\"futurist acid pop\\" and \\"like vintage English freak beat ‚Äì early Pink Floyd, a pithier Van der Graaf Generator ‚Äì laced with postpunk menace.\\" Rock journalist Ann Powers wrote in Calendar Magazine (San Francisco): \\"No other San Francisco band reaches the heights of supreme imagination, ego and crunchiness required for true rock stardom as well as the Ophelias.\\" Hard Report said, \\"This is one of the most original and fascinating groups the American independent scene has to offer. Every part of this music machine is working overtime and bandmaster Leslie Medford jumps in and out of this world with a shy, unsettled voice and moody abstract lyrics. From the blasting cacophony of horns to a quiet stab of silence, adventurous listening is a guarantee on an album that stretches your imagination while tempting the rest with one catchy chorus after another.\\" Vinyl copies of The Big O were packaged in a die-cut, round album jacket, the last occurrence of this before the music industry stopped manufacturing vinyl albums in 1990. (Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake (1968) by Small Faces, E Pluribus Funk (1971) by Grand Funk Railroad, and The Big Express (1984) by XTC, are other examples of albums released with round sleeves.)  Bare Bodkin  A 15-track compilation album released in 2017, Bare Bodkin includes material personally selected by bandleader Leslie Medford from each of the band's studio releases, in addition to five previously- unreleased tracks which were recorded before the band's breakup. About the album, Medford said, \\"I approached Bare Bodkin as if it would be the last will and testament of The Ophelias, as if it alone might be our legacy. [...] I use [the] four opening \\"new\\" songs to make a kind of personal statement about my feelings as to the prime aesthetic thrust of The Ophelias, musically, lyrically, visually...an extended prologue and set-up for the perhaps more- familiar numbers [.]\\" Guitarist/engineer David Immergl√ºck, in a retrospective on the band, waxed nostalgic about two of the songs newly-released on Bare Bodkin: \\"[I] would love to have had \\"Sleepy Hamlet\\" which was in the can and \\"The Golden Calf Played Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll\\" which was recorded but not used [on The Big O.]\\"  O List!  On December 4, 2018 The Ophelias released O List! a live performance album with seventeen songs. These feature Leslie Medford, David Immergl√ºck, and Terry von Blankers on all tracks, with the last two drummers, Edward Benton on twelve, and Alain Lucchesi on five tracks, respectively. O List! not only includes live versions of previously released studio tracks which often diverge wildly from the studio takes, but also has over thirty minutes of non-album tracks, including covers by Gong and David Bowie. \\"The Hanged Man\\", \\"Dead in the Water\\", \\"Capitol\\", and \\"Dreamer's Waltz\\" are all band originals which make their debut on O List! In toto listeners are treated to an hour of The Ophelias live, circa 1987‚Äì89, as the band alternates muscular, heavy psychedelic rock with interludes of gentle and sweet ‚Äì this dichotomy being an Ophelias‚Äô calling card.  Green Girl  A second volume of live performances, entitled Green Girl, was released on April 23, 2019, comprising sixteen further archival recordings, this time covering the years 1984-1987 (prior to Immergl√ºck's entry to the band). The recordings include rare examples of the band as a three-piece outfit (including a live performance with Melanie Clarin from The Donner Party/The Cat Heads on drums). > \\"From 1984's murky, menacing Lightning Tide; though 1985's gorgeous, poetic > ballad Exeunt: Janette With Baby And Ghost; to 1987's twin renditions of The > Hanged Man, structurally similar, yet wildly different in tone and color; > each track on this album is a vital piece of a puzzle which has until now > been impossible to complete due to the unavailability of the music. > There is a pervading sense of youthful enthusiasm throughout these tracks; > just listen to Medford's gorgeous solo rendition of Nocturnal Blonde, > recorded for a radio show in promotion of The Ophelias' first record---the > sweetness of his voice imparts a sense of sincerity and gravitas to > seemingly-nonsensical lyrics like, \\"We've got meaningful lawns/ rolled and > written upon,\\" urging you over and over to give it just one more listen, in > the hopes that you might finally discern his coded meaning.\\"  Reception and Influence  In Rock and the Pop Narcotic, his 1991 book concerning the distinction and divide between \\"pop\\" and \\"rock\\" in mid- and late- twentieth century music, critic and record label entrepreneur Joe Carducci gave The Ophelias positive mention, furthering his essential premise that popularity is no index of quality. Furthermore, Game Theory's Scott Miller was vocal in his fandom for the band. About \\"Palindrome\\" Scott Miller wrote \\"This recording stands out amid those of the era‚Äîit sounds absolutely like a million bucks.\\" Miller ranks it the fourth-best song released in 1987. In his book \\"Music: What Happened?\\", along with ranking \\"Leah Hirsig\\" the third-best song of 1989, Scott Miller writes: > ...Front person Leslie Medford was a multi-instrumentalist eccentric who had > a wild singing style; Michael Quercio and I idolized him.

It is a shrub with leaves composed of three leaflets, and with white flowers with four petals and four stamens. Unlike many other zierias, its leaves are neither rough, glandular or densely hairy. Description Zieria rimulosa is a shrub which grows to a height of about with its smaller branches rough and slightly angular. Its leaves are composed of three leaflets with the middle leaflet long and wide. The leaves are bright green and both surfaces of the leaves are mostly glabrous apart from a few hairs on the lower surface. The edges of the leaflets often have small warts and are turned slightly downwards. The flowers are white to pale pink and are arranged in groups of up to fifty flowers in leaf axils, each flower in diameter, the groups much longer than the leaves. The fruits are glabrous and dotted with glands. Flowers and fruits have been observed in April. Taxonomy and naming Zieria rimulosa was first formally described in 1942 by Cyril Tenison White in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland from a specimen collected on Mount Mulligan. The specific epithet (rimulosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"full of little fissures or cracks\\". Distribution and habitat This zieria is only known from Mount Mulligan and the Mount Carbine Tableland where it grows in woodland on rocky pavements and cliffs. Conservation Zieria rimulosa is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threat to the species is its limited distribution.

A leg-spin bowler, Stanley made his first-class debut for Transvaal B in 1959-60. He was immediately promoted to the Transvaal first team for the Currie Cup A Section match against Western Province, and took 5 for 112 and 5 for 60 in a victory for Transvaal. At the end of the season, he was included in trial matches for the South African tour of England but was not selected for the tour. Wisden said, \\"As a leg-spinner he was considered to have the most natural action this country has seen for a long time,\\" and considered him unlucky not to be selected in the touring side.Wisden 1961, p. 876. He was less successful for Transvaal in 1960-61, and played for North Eastern Transvaal in the B Section of the Currie Cup in 1962-63 and 1963-64, with reasonable success. That was the extent of his first-class career.
