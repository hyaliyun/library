When that group briefly left the NDP between 1972 and 1974, it became their party's main programmatic statement. The Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada is also known as the Waffle Manifesto. It outlined the Waffle's deep resentment of the \\"American Empire\\" and the organization's commitment to furthering the socialist cause in Canada within the template of a successful democracy. The manifesto also included the Waffle movement's feeling toward Quebec sovereignty. The Manifesto helped contribute to a debate on American control of the Canadian economy and particularly the extent of US ownership of Canadian business and resources and the emergence in Canada of a branch plant economy. The Liberal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau instituted attempts to assert domestic economic control such as the creation of Petro-Canada, meant to assert Canadian control of the energy sector, and the Foreign Investment Review Agency, intended to review and limit foreign ownership and particularly American takeovers of Canadian companies. These measures were introduced in part due to pressure by the NDP, particularly during the minority government that followed the 1972 election. The NDP, in turn, had urged these measures in part due to pressure by the Waffle within the party. After 1974, when the Waffle's party, Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada, disbanded, the Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada became a historical document. The name of the NDP's Socialist Caucus's Manifesto for a Socialist Canada is an echo of the earlier document's influence.

The Zygalski-sheet apparatus takes its name from Polish Cipher Bureau mathematician‚Äìcryptologist Henryk Zygalski, who invented it about October 1938. Method Zygalski's device comprised a set of 26 perforated sheets for each of the, initially, six possible sequences for inserting the three rotors into the Enigma machine's scrambler.On 15 December 1938 the Germans increased the number of rotors from three to five. Only three were still used in the machine at a time, but the number of possible rotor arrangements now jumped from 6 to 60. As a result, 60 sets of perforated sheets would now be needed. Marian Rejewski, \\"Summary of Our Methods for Reconstructing ENIGMA and Reconstructing Daily Keys...\\", Appendix C to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, pp. 242‚Äì43. Each sheet related to the starting position of the left (slowest-moving) rotor. The 26 √ó 26 matrix represented the 676 possible starting positions of the middle and right rotors and was duplicated horizontally and vertically: a‚Äìz, a‚Äìy. The sheets were punched with holes in the positions that would allow a \\"female\\" to occur. Polish mathematician‚Äìcryptologist Marian Rejewski writes about how the perforated-sheets device was operated: Like Rejewski's \\"card-catalog\\" method, developed using his \\"cyclometer,\\" the Zygalski-sheet procedure was independent of the number of plugboard plug connections in the Enigma machine.Marian Rejewski, \\"Summary of Our Methods for Reconstructing ENIGMA and Reconstructing Daily Keys...\\", Appendix C to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 243. Manufacture Bletchley Park Museum The Cipher Bureau's manual manufacture of the sheets, which for security reasons was done by the mathematician- cryptologists themselves,Marian Rejewski, \\"Remarks on Appendix 1 to British Intelligence in the Second World War by F.H. Hinsley,\\" p. 82. using razor blades, was very time-consuming. By 15 December 1938 only a third of the job had been finished. On that date, the Germans introduced rotors IV and V, thus increasing the labor of making the sheets tenfold, since ten times as many sheets were now needed (for the now 60 possible combinations of sequences, in an Enigma machine, of 3 rotors selected from among the now 5). On 25 July 1939, five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau disclosed to their French and British allies, at Warsaw, their cryptologic achievements in breaking Enigma ciphers.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 59. Part of the disclosures involved Zygalski's \\"perforated- sheet\\" method. The British, at Bletchley Park, near London, England, undertook the production of two complete sets of perforated sheets. The work was done, with the aid of perforators, by a section headed by John R.F. Jeffreys.Ralph Erskine, \\"The Poles Reveal their Secrets: Alastair Denniston's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry,\\" Cryptologia 30 (4), December 2006, pp. 294‚Äì305.Ralph Erskine, \\"Breaking Air Force and Army Enigma,\\" in Action this Day, edited by Ralph Erskine and Michael Smith, 2001, p. 53. The sheets were known at Bletchley as Netz (from Netzverfahren, \\"net method\\"), though they were later remembered by Gordon Welchman as \\"Jeffreys sheets\\"; the latter term, however, referred to another catalog produced by Jeffreys' section. The first set was completed in late December 1939. On 28 December part of the second set was delivered to the Polish cryptologists, who had by then escaped from German-overrun Poland to PC Bruno outside Paris, France. The remaining sheets were completed on 7 January 1940, and were couriered by Alan Turing to France shortly thereafter. \\"With their help,\\" writes Rejewski, \\"we continued solving Enigma daily keys.\\" The sheets were used by the Poles to make the first wartime decryption of an Enigma message, on 17 January 1940.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, pp. 84, 94 (note 8). In May 1940, the Germans once again completely changed the procedure for enciphering message keys (with the exception of a Norwegian network). As a result, Zygalski's sheets were of no use, though the Herivel tip could still be used.Marian Rejewski, \\"Summary of Our Methods for Reconstructing ENIGMA and Reconstructing Daily Keys...\\", Appendix C to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, pp. 243, 245.

These devices usually run off 12 volts DC, and are intended to be installed in an automobile, a truck, van, or boat. They are not to be confused with carputers, which may not use a mobile signal. Motorola created a line of mobile radios in the 1930s and 1940s for use in police cruisers and later, for use in taxicabs. More recently a wide variety of mobile ham radios gave rise to the mobileers, taking the technology from the domain of centralized authorities into the widespread use by hobbyists. Over the past 40 years, the large growing community of mobileers has grown from ham radio operators to now include mobile computing, with a host of new products available for trunk-mounted computers, and dashboard displays, such as the Xenarc line of computer screens that run off a cigarette lighter plug. Mobileers are often known by their callsigns. For example, a famous mobileer by the name of Steve Roberts is perhaps more widely known as N4RVE, under which callsign he operates the behemoth vehicle, as well as the microship boat, both equipped with a wide assortment of mobile communications and computational equipment.

Zazie manages to evade her uncle's custody, and m√©tro strike notwithstanding, sets out to explore the city on her own. Language Zazie explores colloquial language as opposed to \\"standard\\" written French; Queneau referred to the language spoken by Zazie and the other characters as \\"neo-French\\". It is marked by colloquial diction and slang, by phonetic spelling, and by \\"the morpho-syntax typical of spoken French\\". For instance, the first word of the book, the neologism Doukipudonktan, is a phonetic transcription of D'o√π (est-ce) qu'il pue donc tant ? (\\"From where does he/do they stink so much?\\"). In the English version of the novel, this is rendered as \\"Holifart watastink\\"; in the movie version the English subtitle reads \\"Whozit who stinks?\\" According to a 1959 article from Elle, \\"to speak Zazie\\" was all the rage in France. Adaptations In 1960 the book was adapted by Louis Malle into a film of the same name, starring Catherine Demongeot as Zazie and Philippe Noiret as Gabriel.

It continued on for almost 100 years, until it filed for bankruptcy in 2007 and was bought by U.S. Steel. In 2016, the company was sold to Bedrock Industries of the United States, which took the company public. The company made its debut on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Nov. 3, 2017. The Hamilton plant has not produced steel since 2011, but its coke ovens and cold rolling finishing works remain in operation. The company employs about 750 people in the Hamilton plant and 1,400 in Nanticoke, OntarioCBC News \\"'Making Stelco great again': A Hamilton steel company changes its name back\\", by Kelly Bennett, 2 December 2016 at its greenfield facility Stelco Lake Erie Works. History The Steel Company of Canada was established in 1910. It was founded after the merging of the Hamilton Steel and Iron Company (1900) with the Canada Screw Company (1866), Montreal Rolling Mills (1868), the Dominion Wire Manufacturing Company (1883) and the Canada Bolt and Nut Company. Charles S. Wilcox, president of the Hamilton Steel and Iron Company at the time of the consolidation, was appointed the first president of Stelco. He held the position until 1916, continuing on with the company as chairman of the board until his death in 1938. Hamilton Waterfront Trail, Stelco in background Several union drives at the plant were unsuccessful until the founding strike of Local 1005 of the United Steelworkers of America in 1946. In 2004, Stelco had financial difficulties and went under court-ordered protection from its creditors, including the Deutsche Bank. Stelco exited Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act (CCAA) protection on March 31, 2006. Several non-core operations were divested, including Stelwire, Norambar (formerly Stelco McMaster Works) and Welland Pipe. The CCAA exit has seen the remaining operations restructured into 9 separate operating businesses, held by the corporate entity of Stelco. On August 27, 2007, U.S. Steel purchased Stelco for $1.9 billion ‚Äì $1.1 billion in cash and assuming $800 million in debt. The company was renamed Hamilton Works ‚Äì US Steel Canada. The deal closed on October 31, 2007. The company was renamed U.S. Steel Canada Inc. and its shares were delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange. In an effort to streamline operations, U.S. Steel announced on March 3, 2009, that it would be temporarily shutting down its Hamilton plant and most of its Lake Erie plant putting more than 2,000 people out of work. This announcement came four months after U.S. Steel laid off 700 employees at the Hamilton plant when it shut down its blast furnace. Market conditions and declining customer orders prompted U.S. Steel to shut down the Hamilton Works on October 1, 2010. 100 jobs were restored when the German Max Aicher steel company bought two steel mills from US Steel, and opened them as \\"Max Aicher North America\\".German buyer firing up two shuttered U.S. Steel mills - TheSpec.com More jobs are expected to be created when the mills are in full production. The Hamilton steel-making and iron-making operations were permanently closed on December 31, 2013. On September 16, 2014, U.S. Steel Canada announced that it would apply for court protection from its creditors. US Steel then stated that it intended to sell all of its remaining operations in Hamilton in the next two months. U.S. Steel Canada was severed from U.S. Steel Corporation in 2015 after it entered Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act protection in 2014.CBC News, \\"Restructuring officer backs proposed U.S. Steel Canada deal\\", by Kelly Bennett, November 2, 2016 In November 2016, a deal was struck to sell U.S. Steel Canada to Bedrock Industries.

Environmental impact Steelmaking in Canada has long been associated with pollution. For example, in 1989 Stelco and Dofasco were listed among the \\"dirty dozen\\" polluters in Ontario: Since Stelco ceased steelmaking in 2011, it received less media attention regarding pollution. Operations The company operates the main Hilton Works in Hamilton, named after the late company president Hugh Hilton, and the Lake Erie Works in Nanticoke on Lake Erie. Until the 2006 restructuring, Stelco's operations also included Stelco McMaster Works in Contrec≈ìur, Quebec, and Stelwire (both acquired by ArcelorMittal in 2006). The Nanticoke plant was notable because it is of a relatively newer design, and uses far less water. Stelco Tower, now known as 100 King Street West and associated with Lloyd D.

The story is a retelling of Cinderella featuring various mythical creatures including fairies, elves, ogres, gnomes, and giants. In 2006, Levine went on to write Fairest, a retelling of the story of Snow White, set in the same world as Ella Enchanted. In 2018, Levine published Ogre Enchanted, a prequel to Ella Enchanted. On April 9, 2004, a movie loosely based on the novel was released. It was directed by Tommy O'Haver and starred Anne Hathaway and Hugh Dancy as Ella and Prince Charmont, respectively. The film received mostly mixed reviews, and was heavily criticized for its changes to the source material. Levine stated that the film is \\"so different from the book that it's hard to compare them,\\" noting the addition of new characters such as Sir Edgar and Heston, and suggested \\"regarding the movie as a separate creative act\\". Summary Ella of Frell is given at her birth the gift of obedience by Lucinda the Fairy. She is now forced to follow through with every command she is told. When Ella is around fourteen, she and her mother are taken ill. Ella recovers while her mother dies. Her cook Mandy reveals herself to be her Fairy godmother. She is also given two gifts by Mandy: a gnome-crafted necklace from her mother and a magic book which allows her to see diary entries, letters and fairy tales. At her mother's funeral, Ella meets the kingdom's prince, Char, who expresses fondness for her mother. At the wake, she is introduced to Dame Olga and her terrible daughters, Hattie and Olive. Her father, Peter, decides to send her to finishing school with the two mean sisters. Before leaving she visits all of her favorite places, once again running into Char, who enjoys her company. At the royal menagerie, they encounter a Gnome toddler standing too close to the Ogre pen. Char saves him in time but hands him to Ella. Ella is then ordered by the Ogre to bring the child to him and against her will she starts toward the pen. They are only saved when Char commands her to stop. On the trip to finishing school, Hattie discovers that Ella does whatever she is told and uses this for her own gain. Her first act is taking Ella's mother's necklace and then depriving Ella of food for the next three days. At school, she is constantly ordered and corrected, taking solace in her new friend, Areida. When Hattie orders Ella to end her friendship with Areida, Ella cannot stand this and sets out to find Lucinda so that she can reverse the spell. She learns of a Giant wedding and hopes to find her there. Ella comes upon the kingdom of Elves, who offer a warm welcome and provisions for the journey ahead. The next morning, she awakens surrounded by ogres who plan on devouring her. She is given the command not to run away, so she is trapped, and stays up all night practicing her persuasive Ogrese in hopes of using it on the ogres. It works and she talks them back to sleep, just in time for Char and his soldiers to show up and apprehend them. The men are impressed with Ella's ability. One of his men is sent to escort Ella to the Giant wedding. Lucinda unintentionally curses the bride and groom to always be together, and two other fairies in attendance give her grief for ruining the newlyweds' lives. Ella then learns that ungrateful recipients of her gifts often end up as squirrels and decides to use an alias when talking to her. Ella tells her she desires more mettle for she is too obedient, but Lucinda tells Ella to \\"be happy to be blessed with such a lovely quality\\" and Ella is forced to feel happy because of her 'gift.' During the carriage ride home with her father, Ella learns that he's lost everything and she's going to have to be married off. She is introduced to a much older duke but her father determines that the duke is too poor to marry her and he hasn't the time to find her another suitor, so he instead must marry Dame Olga. At the wedding of Peter and Olga, Lucinda is in attendance and gifts the bride and groom with eternal love. After the wedding, Ella sneaks away so as not to be seen by Lucinda, but is then found by Char. The two of them wander through the old castle looking for a secret passage. Their search coming up dry, they settle in an indoor garden. They find glass slippers on an old bench, Char gets Ella to put them on and they dance. They then discuss him leaving on a year-long trip before deciding they better get going. On the ride to Olga's house, Peter reveals to her that he's broke. Olga is livid. Char comes to visit Ella the next day, but Hattie orders her to stay in her room. This continues until Char leaves for his trip. They start communicating via letters, which Ella has him address to Mandy so as not to arouse suspicion from her new step-family. When Peter leaves for work, Hattie reveals Ella's curse and Olga makes Ella work as a servant in her house. After months of communicating with each other, Ella falls in love with Char but is uncertain of his feelings. Char professes his love for her and wishes for her to be his queen. Ella's excitement is short-lived when she realizes her curse could be used against him and be very dangerous for him since he will one day be king. She decides they could never be together and writes a letter addressed from Hattie to mislead him into thinking she has run off with a rich earl. Mandy hates to see Ella so hurt and calls upon Lucinda to tell her to undo the gift of obedience in exchange for transforming her into a squirrel for three months. During the next six months, Ella continues to endure the torment of her step-family, as well as writing letters for Char. She learns that Char will be returning soon and three royal balls will be held. Lucinda comes back feeling horribly for Ella but is not able to lift the spell off of her. Lucinda tells her she can only do it herself, but she'll come to provide aid if summoned. When Prince Char returns from his travels, Ella goes to the balls in disguise, with the help of Mandy and Lucinda. At the first ball, she dances with Char, who still wants to be with Ella after a chance meeting with Areida made him question the letter he received. On the second night, Char begs her to come the following night to see him perform a song. On the third night, he introduces her to his parents and dances only with her. Hattie is jealous and unmasks Ella, causing her to flee and lose one of her glass slippers. Char finds the slipper and goes to her home. He asks her to tell him if she loves him, which she does. He then tells her to marry him and she accepts. Hattie orders her not to, she says she can't, then Olga realizes with her curse and being queen, they could have anything and everything, and demands she marry Char. Still concerned for the safety of Char and the kingdom, Ella finds the strength to refuse her command, thus breaking Lucinda‚Äôs spell. Now Ella is able to marry Char on her own accord and she happily accepts. Ella and Areida reconnect. Mandy becomes the castle cook and fairy godmother to Char and Ella's future children. Ella and Char live happily ever after.

The inquiry resulted in the resignation of the Premier (head of government), the calling of two by-elections, the jailing of three former ministers and the Police Commissioner (who also lost his knighthood). It also contributed to the end of the National Party of Australia's 32-year run as the governing political party in Queensland. History The inquiry was established in response to a series of articles on high-level police corruption in The Courier-Mail by reporter Phil Dickie, followed by a Four Corners television report, aired on 11 May 1987, entitled \\"The Moonlight State\\" with reporter Chris Masters. Both reports highlighted prostitution, gambling and possible police corruption. With Queensland's Premier of 18 years, Sir Joh Bjelke- Petersen, out of the state, his deputy Bill Gunn ordered a commission of inquiry the day after the television report was broadcast. The allegations aired in the media were not new; they had surfaced from time to time and some news organisations had been forced to pay damages to aggrieved people who alleged their reputations had been damaged (Bjelke-Petersen himself was notoriously litigious in response to unfavourable press coverage). The government was reported to have initially preferred District Court Judge Eric Pratt, chair of the controversial Police Complaints Tribunal and a close friend of Police Commissioner Lewis, to head the inquiry, which sparked journalist fears that it would be a whitewash. Attorney-General Paul Clauson, after consulting the legal profession, opposed Pratt as unsuitable and he was removed from consideration. The government then approached Ian Callinan, who refused on the basis that he was perceived to be too close to the government. Callinan then recommended Fitzgerald as a suitable head; he also drafted the terms of reference for the inquiry and then represented the Queensland Government before it. While the terms of the inquiry were initially narrow, restricted only to the specific allegations raised against specific persons named in the media over a period of just five years, Fitzgerald used his moral authority to lever the inquiry into a position of being able to inquire into any relevant matter. The terms of reference for the Commission were extended twice. This enabled him to set a new precedent for commissions of inquiry and Royal Commissions in Australia generally, using innovative methods such as indemnities from prosecution for key witnesses to secure vital evidence. Fitzgerald began his formal hearings on 27 July 1987. The inquiry was initially expected to last about six weeks; it instead spent almost two years conducting a comprehensive investigation of long-term, systemic political corruption and abuse of power in Queensland. Public sittings were held on 238 days, hearing testimony from 339 witnesses. On 28 August, a Licensing Branch sergeant, Harry Burgess implicated Jack Herbert, and assistant commissioner Graeme Parker. Parker confessed and implicated police commissioner Sir Terry Lewis on 16 September. The inquiry would eventually outlive the Bjelke- Petersen government. Mike Ahern became the new Premier after Bjelke-Petersen was deposed by his own party. Evidence revealed by the investigation (including testimony from Bjelke-Petersen himself) caused significant political damage and an internal power struggle within the National Party, resulting in Bjelke-Petersen resigning as Premier after his unsuccessful attempt to have the Governor of Queensland sack all of his ministers after they deposed him as party leader. The inquiry's special prosecutor was Doug Drummond QC. It was Drummond who decided not to retry Bjelke-Petersen after the hung jury. Findings Fitzgerald's report was submitted on 3 July 1989. Based on the inquiry's final report, a number of high-profile politicians were charged with crimes; notably Queensland Police Commissioner (Sir) Terry Lewis was charged with corruption. Bjelke-Petersen himself was charged with perjury in respect of evidence given to the inquiry. The jury in the case remained deadlocked, bringing about a mistrial.Joh a great servant: jury foreman In 1992 it was revealed that the jury foreman, Luke Shaw, was a member of the Young Nationals, was identified with the \\"Friends of Joh\\" movement and had misrepresented the state of deliberations to the judge. According to an ABC TV analysis, \\"A later inquiry conducted by Justice Bill Carter found the selection process had been manipulated by ...ex-police officers ...helping to put Joh before a jury led by Young Nationals member, Luke Shaw.\\"Program Transcript Four Corners: The Moonlight State. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. A special prosecutor announced in 1992 there would be no retrial because Sir Joh, then aged 81, was too old. Jack Herbert had been the bagman, collecting bribes for police commissioner Terry Lewis from 1980. Lewis himself had been a bagman for former commissioner Francis Bischof. Lewis was convicted (and subsequently stripped of his knighthood). Leisha Harvey former health minister, was charged with misappropriating of public funds as part of an investigation resulting from the findings of the inquiry. She spent one year in jail. Don Lane, former transport minister, was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for falsifying expense accounts. Lane's resignation resulted in the 1989 Merthyr state by-election. Brian Austin, another former health minister, was convicted of misappropriating public funds. Hinze's resignation led to the 1988 South Coast state by-election. The Queensland Police Special Bureau was formed on 30 July 1940 and renamed Special Branch on 7 April 1948. It was criticised for being used for political purposes by the Bjelke-Petersen government in the 1970s and 1980s, such as enforcing laws against protests (sometimes outnumbering the protesters or using provocateurs to incite violence so the protesters could be arrested) and investigating and harassing political opponents. It was disbanded in 1989 following a recommendation by the Fitzgerald Inquiry. Special Branch destroyed its records before Fitzgerald could subpoena them. In large part due to public anger over the revelations in the Fitzgerald report, the National Party was heavily defeated in the December 1989 state election, which brought the Australian Labor Party to power for the first time since 1957. =Recommendations= The two most significant recommendations were the establishment of the Criminal Justice Commission (CJC) and the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission which was to review electoral boundaries. The need for Freedom of Information legislation in the state was noted, as was the need to review laws relating to public assembly and guidelines for the disclosure of pecuniary interests of parliamentarians. The CJC was to be responsible for investigating specific individuals mentioned during the inquiry. The police culture of the state was also criticised. Aspects such as loyalty to fellow police officers, police not enforcing laws against other police and failure to listen to whistle-blowers were condemned because they led to misconduct, inefficiency and contempt for the justice system. Many of the inquiry's recommendations were implemented by Wayne Goss, the first Labor Party Premier of Queensland in 32 years.

A member of the National Party of Suriname, he served from 24 December 1973 with the transition government, to 25 February 1980. He was overthrown in a coup d'√©tat by the military, led by D√©si Bouterse. Released in 1981 after charges of corruption were dropped, he returned to banking, his previous career. In 1987, Arron was elected as Vice-president of Suriname and served until another coup in 1990 overthrew the government.  Biography  Arron was born in Paramaribo in 1936. He completed high school in 1956, and moved to the Netherlands to study banking. Arron worked several years at the Amsterdamsche Bank. On return to Suriname, he became staff member at the Vervuurts Bank (current name Hakrinbank). In late 1963, he became Deputy Director of the Volkskredietbank (People's Credit Union). In 1961, Arron became a member of the National Party of Suriname (NPS), the main Creole party. In 1970, Arron was chosen as the Chairman of the NPS. In 1973, he created a coalition which included the pro- independence Nationalist Republican Party (PNR), that won that year's general election. On 24 december 1973, Arron became prime minister, and lead the final negotiation for the independence of Suriname. The NPS found an ally in the Dutch PvdA who wanted independence as soon as possible. In February 1974, Arron announced that Suriname would be seeking independence before the end of 1975. Many observers were surprised, as Arron's NPS did not have a majority in favour of independence.van Amersfoort, Hans (October 2011). \\"How the Dutch government stimulated unwanted immigration from Suriname,\\" IMI Working Papers, University of Oxford, p. 11. The Netherlands granted Suriname independence on 25 November 1975. The independence is marked by social unrest, economic depression, and rumours of corruption. Its leaders were accused of fraud in the 1977 elections, in which Arron won a further term. During the first years of independence about one-third of the population emigrated to the Netherlands. The hastily created Suriname National Army had many non- commissioned officers who tried to unionise complaining about corruption, and poor pay. Arron refused to recognise them, and arrested the ringleaders who were to go to trial on 26 February 1980. Also elections were planned for March. On 25 February, Arron was overthrown and jailed in a coup by the military led by D√©si Bouterse. In 1981 Arron was released under house arrest. A year later, he was selected as managing director of the Surinamese People's Credit Bank. In 1987, the United Nations, Netherlands, France and United States pressured the military government to negotiate, and Suriname saw a return to democracy. That year Arron was elected as Vice President of Suriname (and therefore Chairman of the Council of Ministers), serving from 26 January 1988 to 24 December 1990. Ramsewak Shankar was elected as president. Their government was overthrown in 1990 in another coup by Bouterse and the military. In December 2000, Arron was invited by the Royal Tropical Institute to the Netherlands to talk about 25 years of independence of Suriname. On the evening of 4 December, he died in the home of his brother as a result of cardiac arrest.

Its manifesto maintains that the New Democratic Party has moved too far to the right, and is in danger of becoming indistinguishable from the Liberal Party. Consequently, the Socialist Caucus also opposed Tony Blair's Third Way policies and their adoption by the NDP because they \\"[leave] the basic class and economic structures of capitalism unchanged.\\". Origins The Socialist Caucus was founded in early 1998 in Toronto by Barry Weisleder, Joe Flexer, Sean Cain, Jorge Hurtado and other political activists who had been involved in Peter Kormos's unsuccessful 1996 campaign to lead the Ontario New Democratic Party. It soon had branches in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, as well as supporters in Manitoba, Quebec and Nova Scotia. It is now active primarily in Ontario at the federal and provincial levels. It also has supporters in other provinces. The caucus views itself as the successor to The Waffle of the 1960s and 1970s and a number of members in the Socialist Caucus were also in the NDP's Left Caucus and the Campaign for an Activist Party or CAP of the 1980s. The Trotskyist group Socialist Action plays a \\"leading role\\" in the Socialist Caucus. An earlier group called the Socialist Caucus was formed around 1959 and 1960 in Vancouver by a group of Co-operative Commonwealth Federation dissidents, \\"communists, Trotskyists, and fellow travellers\\" led by former CCF Member of Parliament Rod Young, and was involved in the CCF and then the NDP. The group published a journal called Press and then Socialist Caucus Bulletin, which was co-edited by Ernie Tate. The group eventually had branches in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Quebec and eventually folded into The Waffle.https://books.google.ca/books?id=RF7pqMOJAbAC&pg;=PA119&lpg;=PA119&dq;=%22socialist+caucus%22+1960&source;=bl&ots;=9IIzBEEHB4&sig;=ACfU3U29pQts3h0M1zmFuiapicK0ttQ1ZA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjhyLz04azqAhUvoXIEHaU- DtkQ6AEwCnoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q;=%22socialist%20caucus%22%201960&f;=falsehttps://www.marxists.org/archive/dowson/LeftCNews/67man.html#7https://archive.org/stream/ACommunistLife/A%20Communist%20Life_djvu.txt Policies The group is a socialist faction and advocates economic democracy and workers' control, full employment, the nationalization of large industries and the eradication of poverty and homelessness. The caucus is anti- imperialist, and condemns many of the actions of the United States' government. It supports the Cuban Revolution, the withdrawal of Canada from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the independence of Quebec, and opposes Zionism. Leadership campaigns In 2001, the Socialist Caucus ran Marcel Hatch in a leadership challenge against Alexa McDonough. Hatch won 120 votes out of 765 ballots cast. Bev Meslo was the Socialist Caucus' candidate in the party's 2003 leadership election, winning 1.1% of the vote in the party's first One Member One Vote leadership election, which was won by Jack Layton. After an unsuccessful attempt to draft Peter Kormos to run for the leadership of the Ontario NDP, the Socialist Caucus endorsed Michael Prue leading up to the 2009 ONDP leadership election. In the 2012 and 2017 NDP leadership elections, the Socialist Caucus endorsed Niki Ashton, on the latter occasion after leading an unsuccessful effort to draft former Ontario Federation of Labour president Sid Ryan as a candidate. Other activities In 2011, the Socialist Caucus proposed resolutions at that year's federal NDP convention to oppose the Alberta oil sands, legalize marijuana, boycott apartheid Israel, repeal the Clarity Act, and nationalize auto, bank and insurance companies. In the wake of the NDP's breakthrough in the 2011 federal election in which they won over 100 seats and formed Official Opposition in the House of Commons for the first time, Socialist Caucus chair Barry Weisleder told The Globe and Mail that \\"the election on May 2 sent a very clear message: the voters rejected the Liberal Party and the NDP should not strive to become a substitute Liberal Party. That‚Äôs the road to ruin\\", adding that \\"To survive, the NDP has to turn left and offer Canadians and in particular working people, an alternative to the corporate agenda.\\" The faction also opposed a motion to remove the phrase \\"democratic socialism\\" from the preamble of the NDP's constitution and supported an unsuccessful resolution to bar the NDP from considering merger with the Liberal Party of Canada. None of the resolutions proposed by the Socialist Caucus received enough support to reach the floor of the convention for debate. The Socialist Caucus publishes a newspaper named Turn Left, edited by Sean Cain, for each federal and Ontario provincial NDP convention. Beginning with the 2011 NDP convention issue, the publication took the form of a magazine. In September 2011, caucus chair Barry Weisleder won the nomination to be the Ontario NDP's candidate in Thornhill in the 2011 provincial election. Within 48 hours, the party's provincial secretary rescinded the nomination without explanation. The Socialist Caucus opposed moves by the NDP at the 2011 and 2013 federal conventions to rewrite the preamble of the party's constitution in order to remove its commitment to socialism. The Socialist Caucus in the Ontario New Democratic Party criticized Andrea Horwath's conduct of the party's campaign in the 2014 provincial election and unsuccessfully called for a review of her leadership at the party's subsequent convention in November 2014.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/horwath-hopeful-about- leadership-review-at-ontario-ndp-convention/article21603846/ During the 2015 federal election, caucus leader Barry Weisleder was outspoken in his criticisms of the party's platform and campaign, claiming that the party had moved to the right under leader Tom Mulcair. Weisleder told the National Post that the party under Mulcair had undergone \\"a continuation of the movement towards conservative policies. It remains a party linked to working people and the working-class organizations in the country. But its leadership and the policies of that leadership continue to embrace the capitalist order.\\" Subsequently, the Socialist Caucus called for the removal of Mulcair as party leader and supported a leadership review at the NDP convention held in April 2016 in Edmonton.

Throughout many fluctuations in the group's line-up, singer The MC Bat Commander and bassist Crash McLarson have remained the band's two constant fixtures. Since 2006, The Aquabats' members also include keyboardist Jimmy the Robot, drummer Ricky Fitness and guitarist Eaglebones Falconhawk. Easily identified by their masks and matching costumes, The Aquabats are perhaps most recognized for their comedic persona in which they claim to be crime-fighting superheroes. This theme serves as subject for much of the band's music and as part of their theatrical stage shows, which typically feature various stunts and fight scenes with costumed villains and monsters. Musically, The Aquabats have continuously evolved over the course of their career, starting as an eight-member ska band before reinventing themselves in the early 2000s as a new wave-influenced rock quintet. The band's current musical style mixes rock and punk with elements of new wave, ska and synth-pop. The Aquabats have released six studio albums, two extended plays, one compilation and one soundtrack album, among other recordings. To date, three of The Aquabats' albums have charted on the Billboard 200: 1997's The Fury of The Aquabats!, 2011's Hi-Five Soup! and 2019's The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One. The Aquabats' sixth studio album, Kooky Spooky...In Stereo, was released on August 21, 2020. From 2012 to 2014, The Aquabats also created and starred in The Aquabats! Super Show!, a live-action musical action-comedy television series which aired on American cable channel The Hub. The series ran for three seasons, earning a total of eight Daytime Emmy Award nominations and ultimately winning one. Following a successful Kickstarter campaign, the series was independently revived as a biweekly YouTube series in late 2019. History =Formation= Singer Christian Jacobs and bassist Chad Larson (pictured above in 2013) formed The Aquabats with former trumpeter Boyd Terry as a joke band in 1994. In the early 1990s, musicians Christian Jacobs, Chad Larson and Boyd Terry met and befriended each other while living in Brea, California. Having all been active in various local punk and alternative rock bands, the three eventually conceived the idea of forming a joke band satirizing the Orange County punk scene, which Jacobs described at the time as being overwhelmed with \\"testosterone, beer and people fighting\\". The concept was to start an unabashedly silly punk band as a complete antithesis to the genre's more aggressive and humorless bands, with the intention of performing at punk shows to poke fun at the scene. While later attending a ska show in Orange County, Jacobs was exposed to the area's burgeoning ska scene and was impressed by its ethos: as he recalled, \\"No one was fighting or pushing each other but having a good time\\". It was then decided that they would start a ska band instead, \\"to be part of the fun\\". With Jacobs assuming vocal duties, Larson on bass guitar and Terry on trumpet, the trio recruited several more musician friends from other local bands to piece together a full ensemble. Each member of the original line-up had musical backgrounds in various genres, including ska, punk, surf and new wave, all elements which were incorporated into the band's music and aesthetic: for example, the name \\"The Aquabats\\" was created to sound like a classic surf band, while a shared admiration of Devo inspired the idea of matching costumes. Jacobs simply recalled in a 2013 interview, \\"We wanted to combine Devo with surf music and ska\\". Rehearsing only once in a house Jacobs and Larson shared at the time, The Aquabats played their first show a mere week after forming at a house party in August 1994. Larson remembered this show as merely \\"a joke...we weren't trying to be a band. We were trying to have fun\\". Nevertheless, encouraged by a positive audience reception, The Aquabats started performing more local shows, soon becoming familiar faces within the Orange County underground. =1994‚Äì1996: Early years= With professionalism far from foremost concern, The Aquabats' earliest band line-ups changed with almost every concert, occasionally featuring as many as twelve to fourteen musicians at a time onstage, with the majority typically playing brass instruments. As they gradually developed a steady following and began playing shows with more regularity, the band settled into a tighter and more manageable unit consisting of around eight to nine musicians, filled out by a horn section, two guitarists and a keyboardist. It was with this type of line- up that The Aquabats began recording, independently producing the demo tapes The Revenge of the Midget Punchers in 1994 and Bat Boy in 1995. As part of the band's superhero image, each member of The Aquabats adopted a stage name and backstory. Christian Jacobs' alter ego is \\"The MC Bat Commander\\", whose trademark look includes a drawn-on mustache and blacked-out tooth. Initially, The Aquabats intended to make each of their performances unique by wearing a different set of matching costumes for every concert, ranging from chef's uniforms to grass skirts and fezzes, all with an individual persona ‚Äî during one show wearing chef outfits, for instance, the band hosted an actual onstage barbecue. When the group's props and get-ups soon became more cumbersome to transport than their musical equipment, it was ultimately decided a singular costume was required. Terry, a future apparel designer who was employed by the wetsuit manufacturing company Aleeda at the time, acquired a large amount of spare rubber and neoprene and fashioned together a set of helmets and rashguards for the band members. The addition of customized vinyl belts, donated to the band by then-unknown artist Paul Frank, effectively completed the style The Aquabats would maintain for the rest of their career. To accompany their distinct new uniforms, The Aquabats constructed a backstory which alleged they were actually superheroes hailing from the distant island of \\"Aquabania\\", though Larson admits the entire mythology was simply made up piece by piece as they went along from one interviewer to the next. As their mythology grew, the members soon adopted superhero stage names and identities, and began tailoring their live shows around a comic book aesthetic by incorporating onstage stunts and mock battles with costumed villains, antics which were originally ploys to get the band's friends into shows for free. Jacobs' brothers Parker and Tyler, a cartoonist and graphic artist, respectively, were brought in to help develop the band's cartoon-influenced visual style, designing their logos and promotional material as well as playing characters in The Aquabats' stage shows and mythology. In 1995, The Aquabats independently produced and recorded their debut album, The Return of The Aquabats, pressing the CDs themselves. Having already amassed a sizable cult following for their increasingly eccentric live shows, the band managed to sell a respectable 20,000 copies of their album without any marketing or distribution. With the growing mainstream popularity of ska music, The Aquabats quickly rose to prominence within Orange County's booming ska scene, regularly touring alongside the likes of such commercially successful bands as No Doubt, Sublime and Reel Big Fish and bringing them to the brink of achieving mainstream recognition. =1997‚Äì1998: The Fury of The Aquabats! and mainstream breakthrough= Drummer Travis Barker was a member of The Aquabats during their commercial peak in 1997 and 1998, before leaving to join pop punk band Blink-182. By late 1996, propelled by the multi-platinum success of No Doubt and Sublime, ska had broken through into the American mainstream to become one of the most popular forms of alternative music. With record labels now turning their attention towards ska bands, The Aquabats were promptly signed to Goldenvoice Records and released their second album, The Fury of The Aquabats!, in October 1997 through Time Bomb Recordings. While still predominantly a ska album, The Fury showcased a more ambitious musical streak than The Return, incorporating stronger elements of punk and surf, as well as featuring instrumentals, parodies of ragtime and tango music, and a variety of unconventional instruments including sousaphones and banjos. Released at the commercial height of the American ska revival, The Fury earned The Aquabats minor mainstream success, peaking at number 172 on the Billboard 200 and number 12 on its Top Heatseekers, while lead single \\"Super Rad!\\" found regular airplay on MTV and Los Angeles' influential KROQ-FM. On July 25, 1998, they fought the alien rock band Gwar during The Ska Parade. The Aquabats spent 1997 and 1998 touring extensively behind The Fury, carrying out both supporting and headlining tours of the United States and traveling internationally as part of the 1998 Warped Tour. By this time, the band had settled into a stable touring line-up of Jacobs (The Bat Commander), Larson (Crash McLarson), Terry (Catboy), drummer Travis Barker (The Baron Von Tito), guitarists Charles Gray (Ultra Kyu) and Courtney Pollock (Chainsaw, the Prince of Karate), trumpeter Adam Deibert (Prince Adam) and keyboardist/saxophonist James Briggs (Jaime the Robot, later Jimmy the Robot). This line-up would last The Aquabats up until 1998, when, in the middle of a tour with pop punk trio Blink-182, Blink unexpectedly fired their drummer Scott Raynor and recruited Barker as a last- minute replacement to sit in for the rest of the tour. By the tour's close, the band was so impressed with Barker's performance that they invited him to join Blink-182 as a full-time member, an offer which Barker accepted, amicably parting ways with The Aquabats. Barker was succeeded by Gabe Palmer (Doctor Rock), solidifying a line-up which would last the remainder of the decade. With the band now finding enough success to generate both an adequate income and media visibility, Jacobs ‚Äî a former child actor with ties in the entertainment industry ‚Äî began to conceive the idea of adapting The Aquabats' superhero mythology into a television series. After pitching the concept to several networks, Buena Vista Television eventually agreed to help produce a short live-action pilot in 1998, directed by comedian Bobcat Goldthwait. Titled simply The Aquabats!, the pilot followed the fictional misadventures of the eight band members in an intentionally campy style similar to Saturday morning cartoon shows. The pilot, which has yet to be made available for public viewing, failed to attract any network interest and was later openly disowned by the band themselves. =1999‚Äì2004: Change in genre, career decline and semi-hiatus= By the time The Aquabats began writing new material for their next studio album in 1998, the group had begun to feel pigeonholed by their public status as a \\"cheesy ska band\\" and consciously decided to start exploring more diverse musical styles rather than merely returning to a ska- based sound. As such, the band's third album, The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death!, marked an abrupt stylistic shift, completely abandoning the ska rhythms which dominated their previous albums in favor of more punk and new wave-influenced textures, emphasizing guitar and synthesizer-driven melodies over brass and woodwinds. With the total absence of The Aquabats' formerly marketable ska sound, Goldenvoice expressed mixed feelings over Floating Eye, reportedly telling the band that the album had no potential single material and would be difficult to promote. In a 2005 interview, Larson retrospectively lamented upon Floating Eyes lack of a commercial sound, noting that while he and the band felt the material was strong, it \\"probably wasn't the record we should have put out at that time\\". True to their predictions, Floating Eye failed to match the commercial success of its predecessor, charting only at a mere 35 on Billboards Top Heatseekers. Despite the album's underwhelming performance, Goldenvoice nevertheless granted The Aquabats a small budget for a music video, which the band instead used to film a five-minute promotional video as another prospective television pilot, The Aquabats! In Color!, an action-oriented series styled similarly to Japanese tokusatsu shows. Despite potential interest from the Fox Family Channel prior to their acquisition by Disney which cancelled all development deals, the pilot again failed to generate any interest, bringing The Aquabats' career to a standstill. Richard Falomir (Ricky Fitness) joined the band during their career lull in 2002, eventually serving the longest tenure of any Aquabats drummer. Following the huge financial losses Goldenvoice suffered from the inaugural Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 1999, the company was eventually forced to cease operations, leaving the Aquabats without a record label. After an unsuccessful search for a new label, the band eventually turned to the Internet to independently manage and promote themselves while the members resumed their day jobs to continue funding the band. Jacobs likened the experience to a superhero's alter ego, working by day and fighting crime [read: being an Aquabat] by night. While The Aquabats could not secure a proper recording contract, the band did negotiate a distribution deal with Fearless Records, releasing a collection of outtakes and demos from the Floating Eye sessions entitled Myths, Legends, and Other Amazing Adventures, Vol. 2 before slipping back into a period of relative inactivity. With a lack of label support leaving the band to finance themselves entirely out of pocket, The Aquabats indefinitely postponed all plans for future recording or extensive touring, limiting their activity primarily to sporadic shows in the southwest United States. The loss of touring income, coupled with the band members' return to their jobs and families, eventually contributed to the departure of several key members: in 2000, guitarist Gray left the band, followed by Palmer and co- founder Terry in 2002. To avoid the financial constraints of hiring two new members, Adam Deibert assumed a dual role as trumpeter and guitarist for the band's live shows, while Palmer was replaced by former Assorted Jelly Beans drummer Ricky Falomir (Ricky Fitness). With this more stable and compact line- up, The Aquabats returned to the studio to record original music for Evan Dorkins Welcome to Eltingville, a 2002 animated television pilot which aired on Adult Swim but was ultimately not picked up as a series. The following year, the band would release their first DVD, Serious Awesomeness!, featuring a full live performance filmed in Pomona, California and numerous clips spanning their entire career. In 2004, with almost five years passed since having released any official studio material, The Aquabats independently recorded and released the five-track EP Yo! Check Out This Ride! as an attempt to both satisfy the band's fanbase and serve as a potential demo to attract interest from record labels. As their first recording with only six members and no use of a horn section, Yo! Check Out This Ride! marked the most drastic shift yet in The Aquabats' sound, taking the band even further into keyboard- driven rock and new wave-influenced songwriting. This would also mark Deibert's final recording with the band, as he would officially retire from the group later in the year, reducing The Aquabats to a quintet. =2005‚Äì2009: Charge!! and renewed success= The departure of Adam Deibert in 2004 left The Aquabats a five-piece, effectively changing the band's sound and setting the stage for their career rejuvenation with Charge!!. In the summer of 2004, The Aquabats were signed to independent label Nitro Records and began work on a new studio album in the fall. Despite this fortuitous turn of events, the group were still uncertain of their future following their semi-hiatus and radical shift in line-up; Jacobs later admitted that the band spent the recording sessions under the belief that it could possibly be their last album. After several months of production and much online hype, The Aquabats released their fourth album, Charge!!, on July 7, 2005. Continuing with the direction set by Yo! Check Out This Ride!, Charge!! was a bold introduction to The Aquabats' new musical style of guitar-driven, new wave-influenced rock. Released to a largely positive critical reception with many critics praising the band's shift in genre, Charge!! effectively revitalized The Aquabats' career as the band recommitted themselves to regular touring. Days after the album's release, The Aquabats headlined a successful 34-city tour of the United States with similarly theatrical bands The Epoxies and The Phenomenauts, followed by tours of the United Kingdom and Japan, the latter supporting Nitro Records founders The Offspring. On September 23, 2005, The Aquabats made their national television debut on the G4 program Attack of the Show, performing Charge!!s lead single, \\"Fashion Zombies!\\". While the following year would present even more lucrative touring opportunities for The Aquabats, the band's renewed success would also have its drawbacks. In May 2006, it was announced that guitarist Pollock had reluctantly departed the group after 12 years, claiming the band's increased touring activity was conflicting with his business schedule. Pollock was succeeded by former Death by Stereo member Ian Fowles (Eaglebones Falconhawk), though he would continue to contribute guitar tracks to The Aquabats' studio albums and perform with the band as a second guitarist for their southern California concerts and major festival shows. After releasing a limited-print tongue-in-cheek \\"One Year Anniversary Edition\\" of Charge!!, The Aquabats carried out another national tour before announcing a brief hiatus in January 2007 to focus on writing their next album. \\"Cobraman\\" crashes a show in 2008. Costumed characters are staples of The Aquabats' concerts, appearing as part of mock fights or comedic skits. During this period, Jacobs had been pursuing a career in television production with his creative partner and longtime Aquabats collaborator Scott Schultz, independently filming prospective pilots for family television shows. In 2007, Jacobs and Schultz successfully sold one of their pilots, a preschooler show called Yo Gabba Gabba!, to Viacoms Nick Jr. channel. As a musically oriented program, Yo Gabba Gabba! featured several guest appearances by The Aquabats, appearing onscreen performing both old and new songs and starring in various sketches. The series went on to become an award-winning international sensation, bringing a generous amount of media attention towards both Jacobs and The Aquabats, just enough to persuade Gabbas production company Wild Brain to help produce a new pilot again based on the band. Shot on location throughout California in early 2008, The Aquabats' third television pilot, titled The Aquabats! Super Show!, was a fully realized half-hour episode featuring both live-action and animated storylines starring and featuring original music by the band. The Aquabats spent the remainder of 2008 heavily promoting the Super Show! pilot through extensive viral advertising and further touring, including appearances at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International, where the pilot was publicly debuted for fans, high- profile festivals including the Bamboozle Left and Groezrock in April 2009, and opening for Blink-182 on two dates of their 2009 reunion tour. Though The Aquabats continued to be a popular touring draw, the band experienced a tumultuous period of pre-production on their proposed fifth studio album lasting for nearly two years. Though a July 2007 news update announced that preliminary recording had already begun, no new material ever surfaced from these sessions or was ever performed live. As the band resumed touring throughout the United States and Europe, fewer updates were reported on the album's progress until all plans were abruptly ceased in April 2009, when The Aquabats were dropped from Nitro Records due to \\"trying economic times and a struggling musical landscape\\", according to Jacobs. With a glum confirmation of \\"no record company, no record\\", The Aquabats' future seemed once again shadowed in doubt. =2010‚Äì2013: Hi-Five Soup! and The Aquabats! Super Show!= From 2012 to 2014, The Aquabats starred in and wrote original music for the action-comedy television series The Aquabats! Super Show!, created and produced by Christian Jacobs. Despite the lack of a record label, The Aquabats continued to tour internationally throughout 2010 and 2011, headlining tours of the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as appearing at the 2010 Soundwave festival in Australia ‚Äî the band's first ever visit to the continent. In August 2010, The Aquabats suddenly announced on their website that they would be independently releasing their next studio album in November of that year. However, following a last-minute distribution deal with Fearless Records, the album's release date was postponed to 2011 to provide for proper marketing and promotion, and an EP containing its first single, Radio Down!, was released in its place. Hi-Five Soup!, The Aquabats' fifth full-length album, was released on January 18, 2011, becoming the band's highest-charting album since The Fury, debuting at number 181 on the Billboard 200 and number 5 on Top Heatseekers. In promotion of the album, the band embarked on a 21-city national tour supporting Reel Big Fish, followed by a performance at the 2011 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. On March 24, 2011, it was formally announced via press release that The Aquabats! Super Show! had been acquired as a series by family cable channel The Hub, a joint venture between Hasbro and Discovery which launched in 2010 as a replacement for Discovery Kids. Created and produced by Jacobs, Schultz and Jason deVilliers, the series followed the fictionalized adventures of The Aquabats in a deliberately campy style inspired by the 1960s Batman TV series, mixing live-action storylines with cartoon shorts, parody commercials and musical interludes featuring new original music and songs written and performed by the band. After spending the majority of 2011 in production, the first season of The Aquabats! Super Show! ran for thirteen episodes from March 3, 2012 to June 16, 2012, meeting with a largely positive critical reception and consistently high ratings for the modestly sized channel, eventually earning a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Children's Series, which it ultimately lost to fellow Hub series R. L. Stine's The Haunting Hour. In October 2012, production began on the series' second season, which premiered on June 1, 2013 with a short run of five episodes. The following October, three additional episodes were filmed, though The Hub later explicitly referred to these episodes as \\"specials\\" rather than a continuation of season two. These three specials aired from December 21, 2013, to January 14, 2014. In a Huffington Post feature on the band prior to the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, Jacobs revealed that The Hub had opted not to renew The Aquabats! Super Show! for another season following extensive network rebranding by Hasbro and Discovery, effectively canceling the series. Jacobs admitted he was surprised by this turn of events, noting \\"Everything we heard was that the show has been a real Cinderella story for the Hub and that it was rating really well with viewers. We just assumed that we'd eventually go back into production or at least get picked up for Season 3\\", but ultimately concluded \\"it is what it is\\" in regard to the network's decision. =2014‚Äì2018: Continued touring and anniversary shows= Since the 2012 premiere of The Aquabats! Super Show!, The Aquabats largely cut back on extensive touring in order to accommodate their television production schedule, once again limiting their live shows to occasional performances within the Southwestern United States. In April 2013, the band carried out a six-show tour of Europe and the United Kingdom, concluding with an appearance at the Groezrock punk rock festival in Belgium. The following June, The Aquabats were once again featured on the Warped Tour, though only played eight shows in the Southwest region. Despite playing a limited portion of the tour, the band were regularly featured on the second season of Fuses Warped Roadies, a reality series documenting the road crew of the Warped Tour, where they were most notably the subject of one episode in which they incur the wrath of a stage manager for repeatedly playing over their set times. On March 17, 2014, in celebration of their 20th anniversary as a band, The Aquabats announced the first leg of their \\"20th Anniversary Tour\\" for May, their first extensive headlining United States tour in years, covering fifteen shows in nine states on the East Coast. The following July, the band carried out five more dates across California, Washington and Oregon, then announced eleven more dates covering six states across the western half of the country. Following another stretch of relative inactivity for most of 2015 and 2016, The Aquabats announced a 13-date tour of the American Midwest and East Coast in May 2017, supported by Reggie and the Full Effect, C. J. Ramone and Kepi Ghoulie, subsequently followed by a six-date tour of the West Coast in October with Dog Party. Ticket options for these shows included \\"Super Rad Packages\\" with bonus exclusive merchandise, most notably a split 7\\" single of full-length versions of the Super Show! songs \\"Burger Rain\\" and \\"Beat Fishin'\\", The Aquabats' first new studio recordings since 2011's Hi-Five Soup. In mid-February 2018, The Aquabats played nine dates in the United Kingdom with Army of Freshmen supporting Bowling for Soup on their \\"Get Happy!\\" tour. In celebration of the 20th anniversary of 1997's The Fury of The Aquabats!, the band worked with veteran producer and engineer Cameron Webb on a complete remaster of the album which was independently released on vinyl and CD with bonus material on April 6, 2018. The following day, The Aquabats played two sold-out shows at Los Angeles' Fonda Theater where they performed The Fury of The Aquabats! in its entirety, joined by former members Pollock, Terry and Deibert. Notably, Travis Barker appeared during the evening show to play three songs as his Baron von Tito persona, marking the first time Barker had performed with the band since 1998. Three weeks later on April 28, this extended line-up performed as part of Barker and John Feldmann's Back To The Beach ska festival in Huntington State Beach, where Barker again joined the band for three songs. =2019-present: The Aquabats! RadVentures! and Kooky Spooky...In Stereo= On July 31, 2018, after several weeks of teasing a major band announcement, The Aquabats launched a high-profile Kickstarter campaign with the goal of raising a minimum of $1.1 million to help finance an entire return season of The Aquabats! Super Show!, as well as the production and release of three albums: a new studio album, a Super Show! soundtrack and a re-recorded greatest hits compilation. The campaign video featured a slew of celebrity cameos voicing support for the band, though most prominently featured actor and musician Jack Black, who was confirmed by Billboard to serve as executive producer for the series' return. Along with the launch of the Kickstarter, The Aquabats began releasing a series of metafictional Super Show! \\"mini-episodes\\" exclusively to their YouTube channel, depicting the MC Bat Commander's quest to reunite the estranged Aquabats following their show's cancellation. By August 28, mere days before the campaign's end date of September 1, the Kickstarter had only raised $601,629 of the band's desired $1.1 million goal. The funding was voluntarily cancelled and the campaign was significantly restructured, resurrected the same day with a new goal of $100,000 for a new album and continuing production of Super Show! \\"mini-episodes\\". The $100,000 mark was met within minutes and the project ultimately raised over $600,000, which was stated to be used to independently produce \\"at least twelve\\" mini-episodes of Super Show!, two new Aquabats studio albums, one live album, and two Super Show! soundtrack albums. Throughout 2019, The Aquabats worked resolutely to fulfill their Kickstarter-funded projects. In March, the band simultaneously released The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One, a soundtrack compilation of songs from Super Show!s first season, and The Fury of The Aquabats! Live at The Fonda!, a live recording of a 2018 performance of The Fury of The Aquabats!, as exclusive digital downloads for Kickstarter backers. In June, preceded by the release of the single \\"Cobraman Theme!\\", The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One was given a wide physical release on The Aquabats' self-operated label Gloopy Records, premiering at 165 on the Billboard 200 and number one on Top Heatseekers, the band's highest placement on each chart to date. Starting September 28, 2019, The Aquabats! Super Show! was officially relaunched as a biweekly YouTube- exclusive web series entitled The Aquabats! RadVentures!. \\"Skeleton Inside!\\", the first single from The Aquabats' sixth studio album, premiered on the band's YouTube channel on October 25, 2019, though did not make mention of an album title or a tentative release date beyond \\"later this year\\". The album's official title, Kooky Spooky...In Stereo, was revealed in February 2020, followed by the album's second single, the couch potato-themed \\"Pajamazon!\\", on April 10. Inspired by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, which necessitated mass self-quarantining and social distancing, \\"Pajamazon!\\" was promoted by a music video primarily made up of self-submitted videos of fans and friends of The Aquabats dancing to the song in their homes, marking The Aquabats' first music video since \\"Fashion Zombies!\\" in 2005. While Kooky Spooky...In Stereo was originally scheduled for a June 20 release date, manufacturing delays resulting from the coronavirus pandemic as well as political tensions from the ongoing George Floyd protests which began in late May 2020 prompted the band to postpone the album's release; in an uncharacteristically serious public statement, The Aquabats acknowledged that \\"There will always be time for goofy, rowdy rock...but it doesn't feel right to us to be loud and self-promoting at this moment in time\\", encouraging open discussion about race and racism and linking to resources from the National Museum of African American History and Culture and confirming a new digital release date of August 21, 2020. Musical style Over the course of their career, The Aquabats have experienced several radical evolutions in their sound and musical style. Having originally formed as a part of Orange County's burgeoning third wave ska scene, much of the band's early material was rooted in the genre. Boasting an eight-piece line-up featuring two lead guitarists, a keyboardist and a horn section consisting of two trumpets and a saxophone, The Aquabats' style of ska was primarily driven by brass and guitar, incorporating elements of surf rock and punk rock. Their second album, 1997's The Fury of The Aquabats!, while still predominantly ska-based, found the band starting to expand their sound into newer territory, featuring more pronounced punk and surf influences and tongue-in-cheek experimentalism, including several instrumentals, pastiches of ragtime and tango music and the utilization of such unconventional instruments as clarinets, electric sitars and even manualism. In 1999, The Aquabats underwent a significant shift in style for their third studio album, The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death!, and its companion piece Myths, Legends, and Other Amazing Adventures, Vol. 2, further exploring the multi-genre eclecticism which had been hinted at with The Fury. A conscious decision by the band to write more diverse material, these albums saw a near-complete forfeit of the brass-driven ska of their previous albums in favor of more guitar and synthesizer-structured songwriting, embracing a punk rock and new wave sound greatly influenced by Devo and Oingo Boingo, two of The Aquabats' biggest inspirations. The band also began widening their genre experimentation to encompass such disparate styles as electronica, synthpop and even hip-hop, elements which persist in their sound to present day. During The Aquabats' career lull in the early 2000s, several of the band's key members departed from the line-up, eventually reducing the former octet down to a mere quintet of vocals, guitar, keyboards, bass, and drums. This inevitably had a profound impact on The Aquabats' sound, in particular the complete loss of their once characteristic horn section. 2005's Charge!!, the first release featuring this reduced line-up, marked an abrupt shift from the eclecticism of their previous records, firmly establishing The Aquabats' current rock-based musical style, mixing elements of punk, new wave and ska, a style which has also been described as some publications as \\"nerd rock\\" owing to the band's lyrical emphasis on pop culture. In recent years, The Aquabats have introduced an increased presence of keyboards and synthesizers into this style, with critics noting their 2011 album Hi-Five Soup! as featuring more noticeable elements of synthpop and electronica. =Departure from ska genre= Although the band continues to incorporate occasional elements of ska into their music, The Aquabats have since distanced themselves from their association with the ska genre after having moved away from an overtly ska- based sound in the early 2000s, having since labeled themselves as simply a \\"rock band\\" in their official press biographies. In a 2012 interview, singer Christian Jacobs stated \\"I don't think we ever considered ourselves a ska band. We were just The Aquabats. And some of the songs we happened to play were ska\\", noting elsewhere, \\"It was never a deliberate thing [to stop playing ska], but I think it just naturally happened because there's a lot of different styles of music that we play. I've always been into bands like Ween and things like that, that can chameleon-like drift from genre to genre and play whatever music they want...there's no boundaries. If you set yourself up as a punk band, then you pretty much just have to play punk. Or if you're a ska band, you just play ska\\". Chad Larson, speaking on the same matter, explained \\"Having the same guitar rhythm for every song gets kind of boring...even on the earlier albums that had ska rhythms we were focusing more on the 'adventure' songs than really 'ska' songs. So as we grew as musicians, we wanted to experiment with different rhythms\\", adding \\"we were never really a good ska band anyway\\". Live performances Coachella Festival, featuring an elaborate set-up of large inflatable characters. Since the earliest days of the band, The Aquabats have earned a reputation for their theatrical live performances featuring a variety of comedic stunts and antics based around their superhero-themed persona. During the 1990s, when their concerts were at their most elaborately staged, a typical Aquabats performance would often include choreographed fight scenes with costumed villains, the use of numerous props, acrobatic stunts and varying degrees of pyrotechnics, ranging from small fireworks to The MC Bat Commander fire breathing. While many of these elements were eventually phased out of the live shows in the early 2000s, the one consistent staple of every Aquabats concert has remained the band's onstage \\"battles\\" with villains and monsters. These villains, typically played by The Aquabats' road crew, will crash the stage at one or two moments in the show and exchange humorous banter with the band before engaging each other in mock combat. These fights have ranged from short, improvised fistfights to fully choreographed stage combat utilizing breakable props, maneuvers such as flying kicks and back flips, and sometimes spreading out into the audience, with The Aquabats ultimately winning most‚Äîbut not all‚Äîencounters. For some performances, in place of a villain, The Aquabats will feature a sketch with one of their \\"allies\\": for example, to segue into their song \\"Magic Chicken\\", the titular character‚Äî a man in a chicken suit‚Äî will come onstage to hand out fried chicken to audience members. \\"Pool Floatie Races\\" is one of many ways The Aquabats incorporate audience participation into their shows. Audience participation is a common element of The Aquabats' stage shows. Both the band and their onstage characters regularly interact with the crowd, including initiating mass games of beach ball volleyball or spraying them with substances like Silly String and fire extinguishers. Additionally, a few of The Aquabats' enemies are known only to be \\"defeated\\" by fans by being pelted with projectiles supplied by the band, usually large quantities of plastic balls. Acknowledging the younger members of their fanbase, The Aquabats often incorporate any children in the venue as part of their shows, inviting them to dance onstage with the band at the end of their sets. With parents' permission, children can also take part in onstage games and activities with the aid of the audience. The most common of these have included \\"pool floatie races\\", where two selected children mount inflatable rafts or pool toys and race across the venue via crowd surfing, and assisted stage diving, in which between songs the MC Bat Commander will gently throw children into a waiting audience so they may experience their \\"first punk rock moment\\". On the visual end of these performances, keeping in line with their cartoon and pop culture- inspired aesthetic, The Aquabats' stage shows are accompanied by a large video screen backdrop which plays montage clips of various cartoons, movies, TV shows, and stock footage specifically edited to match each song. This screen also plays prerecorded comedy videos starring the band which introduce and close each show, as well as fake commercials for fictional Aquabats-brand products which serve as impromptu \\"commercial breaks\\" between songs. These visuals, along with the band's props and costumes, are regularly changed to accommodate special seasonal performances, in particular The Aquabats' annual holiday shows. Superhero mythology The Aquabats fighting villains in San Francisco in 2012. Many of these onstage villains have been established in The Aquabats' fictional superhero mythology, with developed backstories of their own. Perhaps even more so than for their music, The Aquabats are widely recognized for their eccentric superhero identity which adheres to a comprehensive mythology reflected in the band's music, stage shows and promotional material in which the members are in fact a team of musical crimefighters on a quest to save the world. Detailed in their lyrics, liner notes, website and television series, The Aquabats have developed a small but elaborate fictional universe surrounding this mythology, describing the band's fictitious history and outlandish adventures as well as conceiving an extensive roster of enemies and allies, many of whom are the subjects of specific songs and have appeared as part of The Aquabats' stage shows in mock fight scenes or comedic skits. Over the years, this mythology, and in particular the fictional backstory regarding their origins, has continually changed, evolved and occasionally been retconned to explain changes in the band's line-up. The Aquabats' origin story can be separated into two distinct eras. For the first half of their career, the band maintained a consistently canonical backstory established over the course of their first two albums, alleging the band members were actually humanoid bat creatures hailing from a distant tropical island called Aquabania. According to legend, Aquabania had been invaded by the villainous Space Monster \\"M\\", forcing the surviving inhabitants to flee into the ocean where they eventually washed ashore in California and were taken in by Professor Monty Corndog, a mad scientist who used \\"chemicals\\" to give them superpowers. Donning costumes including such accessories as \\"radioactive rashguards\\", \\"power belts\\", and \\"anti-negativity helmets\\", The Aquabats chose to channel their powers through music in order to \\"take over the world\\" by attracting legions of fans to aid them in combating Space Monster \\"M\\" and reclaiming their homeland, fighting the numerous villains and monsters who'd attempt to thwart their musical quest along the way. With the heavy line-up changes in the early-to-mid 2000s which left only two of the original members remaining, The Aquabats eventually dropped the Aquabania elements out of their backstory, reestablishing themselves as a group of freelance superheroes of indeterminate origin who travel the countryside, fighting evil and \\"destroying boredom\\". This loose framework would later serve as the basis for the band's television series, The Aquabats! Super Show!, where each member's character was further developed to showcase their own individual powers and personalities, transitioning the Aquabats' mythology from a story arc to a character ensemble. While the series' first season left the band's origins intentionally vague, several episodes of the second season feature each member of The Aquabats recounting the band's history in animated flashback sequences; while one of these sequences recalls the original Aquabania mythos, each member's flashbacks directly contradict one another, leaving it unknown which could be considered officially canonical. Aquacadets and The Aquabats Cadet Faction The Aquabats' dedicated fanbase and members of their official fan club are referred to as \\"Aquacadets\\". Fans of The Aquabats are referred to by the band as Aquacadets or the more casual \\"Cadets\\", a title which has held alternately official and unofficial status among their fanbase for most of the band's career. Throughout the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s, The Aquabats operated an official fan club known as The Aquabats Cadet Faction, selling membership packages which typically offered a variety of exclusive merchandise, access to exclusive web content, a subscription to an official newsletter written by members of the band and entrance into occasional semi-private \\"secret shows\\" held at smaller venues. Most significantly, enrollment into The Aquabats Cadet Faction granted card-carrying members admission into official fan conventions known as Cadet Summits, where fans could meet and interact with The Aquabats through Q&A; panels, games and award shows where fans received trophies in categories including \\"Cadet of the Year\\". The Aquabats held five such Cadet Summits throughout Southern California from 1997 to 2006: * October 25, 1997, Fountain Valley: The Aquabats hosted a day for fans at Bullwinkle's Family Fun'N'Food family entertainment center, which featured the premiere screening of the \\"Super Rad!\\" music video. * December 5, 1998, Pomona: the band performed an exclusive show at The Glass House concert venue alongside screenings of various videos including the only public showing of The Aquabats! 1998 television pilot. * April 6, 2000, Santa Ana: advertised as \\"The Third Sorta-Annual 1999/2000 Aquacadet Summit\\", The Aquabats performed an extended awards show-themed concert at The Galaxy Theatre, featuring additional performances by side projects The Moon Monkeys, Digital Unicorn and Le Pigbat. * January 18, 2002, Huntington Beach: The Aquabats hosted a picnic gathering on the beach, highlighted by an acoustic singalong set made up entirely of fan requests. This performance was recorded and later released as an officially sanctioned bootleg cassette in 2014. * June 6, 2006 in San Diego: hosted at the Concourse Meeting Hall during San Diego Comic-Con weekend, the band celebrated the 10th anniversary of The Return of The Aquabats by performing the album in its entirety with former member Prince Adam. Following the 2006 Cadet Summit, The Aquabats Cadet Faction lapsed into an extended period of complete inactivity, upon which fans independently carried on unofficial fan club operations through social media, most notably the formation of numerous splinter factions based around certain themes, shared interests or geographic location: while most of these groups were small sub-sections within online fan communities such as Tumblr, some factions like \\"Piratebats\\" and \\"Ninjabats\\" cultivated a small real-world presence by attending The Aquabats' concerts in accordingly themed costume attire. In 2018, The Aquabats temporarily resurrected The Aquabats Cadet Faction as part of the Bring Back The Aquabats! Kickstarter campaign, again issuing personalized ID cards and exclusive merchandise and web content. As of 2020, however, Cadet Faction packages are no longer available, and there are no current plans for a future Cadet Summit. In 2019, independent record label Related Records, who had previously released the officially sanctioned 2014 bootleg of The Aquabats' acoustic performance at the 2002 Cadet Summit, compiled and released No Singles: A 20 Year Anniversary Tribute to The Aquabats vs. The Floating Eye of Death, a fourteen-track tribute album covering the entirety of the band's 1999 Floating Eye of Death album by various underground punk, electronica and experimental musicians including The Emotron. Side bands and related projects Sharing \\"the same DNA, songs, band members and resources\\", GOGO13 are credited for influencing the formation of The Aquabats, particularly in their use of humor and stage theatrics. The roots of The Aquabats are usually traced back to GOGO13, a ska band founded by Christian Jacobs' brothers Parker and Tyler while they were living in St. George, Utah in 1993. Following their abrupt disbandment in 1994, several of GOGO13's members moved on to play in The Aquabats' earliest line-ups, during which time the band's performances consisted of several GOGO13 songs, most notably \\"Idiot Box!\\", which was later recorded for The Aquabats' first two albums. Parker Jacobs permanently reformed GOGO13 in 2001 and continues to tour with a rotating line-up of musicians which, among others, have included original Aquabats trumpeter Boyd Terry and guitarist Ben \\"The Brain\\" Bergeson. From 1993 to 1995, Adam Deibert, Charles Gray, Corey Pollock and Pat \\"Patbat\\" McDonald were all members of the Huntington Beach ska band The Goodwin Club, recording only one full-length album before disbanding in April 1995, playing their final show opening for The Aquabats. The Goodwin Club reunited in 2015 with Deibert, Pollock and McDonald returning from the original line-up and continue to sporadically perform throughout Southern California, including as support for The Aquabats and GOGO13. Prior to forming The Aquabats, Christian Jacobs sang in a shoegazing duo called The Moon Men with future Aquabats and Yo Gabba Gabba! collaborator Scott Schultz, while Chad Larson was the bass guitarist for the hardcore punk band B.H.R. until their break-up in 1997. In 1997, Parker Jacobs formed The Sandfleas as a side project to perform as openers at The Aquabats' shows, based on the gang of masked villains who had become a staple of The Aquabats' mythology and onstage rogues' gallery. Consisting anonymously of Parker Jacobs on vocals and a rotating line-up of musicians including Christian and Tyler Jacobs, Larson and Pollock, The Sandfleas played deliberately sloppy punk rock songs which were humorously antagonistic and insulting towards their audience, intending to be the musical \\"bad guy\\" equivalent to The Aquabats' \\"good guys\\". The Sandfleas released an EP entitled Four Songs Four Jerks on The Aquabats' Horchata Records label in 1999 before breaking up shortly afterwards. Adam Deibert formed Digital Unicorn as an opening band for an Aquabats tour in 1999, which ultimately evolved into a full-fledged solo project. During their time in The Aquabats, Deibert and Gray both joined the Long Beach indie pop band Bikeride in 1999 as bassist and guitarist, respectively, recording on three of the band's studio albums, all of which featured James Briggs guest contributions on saxophone and clarinet. Gray left Bikeride in 2002, though Deibert remained a member until lead singer-songwriter Tony Carbone's death from cancer in 2008. Shortly before Carbone's death, The Aquabats hosted a benefit show for Carbone in Pomona, California, where Deibert joined the band onstage during their encores. From 1999 to 2010, Deibert was also active in the two-man electronic project Digital Unicorn, which he had originally created as a last-minute replacement for an opening band who had dropped off a tour with The Aquabats. Digital Unicorn eventually progressed into a solo endeavor, culminating in the studio album Theirs Travel Began and Loaded the Dream, which was released on Horchata Records in 2001. After leaving The Aquabats in 1996, Ben Bergeson founded the instrumental surf rock band The Moon Monkeys, playing numerous shows with The Aquabats and GOGO13 before releasing their sole studio EP So Far, Far Out! in 1999 on Horchata Records. Corey Pollock, following his own departure from The Aquabats in 2006, joined the Costa Mesa pop punk trio and longtime Aquabats tourmates Supernova in August 2008, playing with them under his Aquabat stage name of \\"Chainsaw\\" until their hiatus in January 2010. As professional musicians, current guitarist Ian Fowles and drummer Ricky Falomir have performed and recorded with many bands and musicians of note, though are best known as original members of the punk rock bands Death by Stereo and Assorted Jelly Beans, respectively. In relation to The Aquabats, Fowles was a guest bassist for Hunter Burgans Hunter Revenge and ‚Äì in costume as EagleBones ‚Äì Kepi Ghoulies band during both groups' tours with The Aquabats, and in 2014, became an official member of My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Ways solo band after the two had become acquainted working together on The Aquabats! Super Show!, recording and co-writing on Way's 2014 debut Hesitant Alien. In June 2015, both Fowles and Falomir made up ex-Ramones bassist C. J. Ramones backing band for an East Coast tour with Japanese band Shonen Knife. Ricky also toured playing drums for LA reggae band The Aggrolites in 2009. The band's original instrumental version of \\"Sequence Erase!\\", recorded with Parry Gripp, was used as the title theme for the band's original television pilot, The Aquabats! In Color!. From 2004 to 2010, this recording was used as the theme song to the main series of Mega64, a video game-themed comedy series produced by a comedy troupe of the same name. As longtime friends and associates of The Aquabats, the main cast and crew of Mega64 would later go on to produce interstitial sketches for The Aquabats! Super Show! television series.

Career =Chicago Cubs= Adams made his Major League debut with the Cubs on September 18, 1922. He played 11 games during the 1922 Chicago Cubs season. He spent the following two seasons as the team's shortstop, splitting time at the position with Charlie Hollocher. In the 1923 Chicago Cubs season, he hit four home runs in 311 at-bats for the season, then went on to hit only five the following 5,246 at-bats of his career. The 1925 Chicago Cubs season became his breakthrough, as he became a second baseman as a result of a trade that sent George Grantham to Pittsburgh, leaving the second base position open. As a hitter, he finished the season with 26 stolen bases, eight triples, and 627 at-bats, which led the National League. As a fielder, he led all second basemen in putouts, assists, and fielding average for the season. In 1926, Adams increased his batting average to .309, and stole a career-high 27 bases, second-best in the National League. He also played all 154 games of the season, finished first in at-bats for the second year in a row with 624, and finished first in plate appearances with 700. The 1927 Chicago Cubs season saw Adams being used mainly as a utility infielder, although he started nearly every game. He played 60 games at second base, 53 at third base, and 40 at shortstop. He led the league in at-bats for the third year in a row with 647, and stole 26 bases for the third year in a row. =Pittsburgh Pirates= The 1927 season marked the end of Adams' time in Chicago. On November 28, 1927, Adams was traded along with Pete Scott to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Kiki Cuyler. Manager Joe McCarthy was criticized for the move, as the Cubs has plenty of outfield strength, but lacked a solid infield presence. It was also considered a good move for Pittsburgh, with sportswriters picking the Pirates to finish first the National League in 1928. He was given the starting second baseman job for the 1928 Pittsburgh Pirates season. He took the place of George Grantham, so was moved to first base, the second time that Adams forced Grantham to another infield position. However, his batting average began to decline, and by the 1929 Pittsburgh Pirates season, he was being used as a utility infielder. At the end of the season, the St. Louis Cardinals purchased his contract from the Pirates after two seasons of playing in Pittsburgh. =St. Louis Cardinals= As the 1930 St. Louis Cardinals season began, Adams was given the starting third baseman job. He went on to have a career high batting average of .314, and hit a career high nine triples. He played all six games in the 1930 World Series, hitting .143 as the Cardinals ended up losing the series. That season, every single Cardinals player with over 300 at-bats had a batting average over .300, the only time in history this has happened. The 1931 St. Louis Cardinals season ended up being a career year for him. He was first in the league in doubles with 46, and had over 600 at-bats for the fourth season. He also placed in MVP voting, finishing ninth with 18 votes. He played 143 games over the season, however, an injury in September caused him to miss postseason time. He was injured on September 20 when, after winning a bunting and running contest before the game, sprained his ankle while taking part in the baserunning challenge. He played two games as the Cardinals won the 1931 World Series. The following season, he only played 31 games due to injury. =Cincinnati Reds= On May 7, 1933, Adams was traded along with Paul Derringer and Allyn Stout to the Cincinnati Reds for Leo Durocher, Dutch Henry, and Jack Ogden, after playing only eight games for the Cardinals that season. He became the starting leadoff man during the 1933 Cincinnati Reds season, as he had been for the other teams he played for. During the 1934 Cincinnati Reds season, he was primarily a backup to Mark Koenig, was used as the backup second baseman and third baseman. At the end of the season, Adams was released, and he retired at the end of the 1935 season. After his retirement, he became a farmer and a service station operator in Tremont, Pennsylvania. When he died in Pottsville, Pennsylvania on February 24, 1989, he was the last remaining player for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1931 World Series. =Career Statistics= In 1,424 games over 13 seasons, Adams posted a .286 batting average (1,588-for-5,557) with 844 runs, 249 doubles, 48 triples, 9 home runs, 394 RBI, 154 stolen bases, 453 bases on balls, .343 on-base percentage and .353 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .963 fielding percentage playing at second base, third base, shortstop and several games in the outfield. In the 1930 and '31 World Series, he was unproductive, hitting only .160 (4-for-25) with only one RBI. Height At , Adams was the smallest Major League player during his career.

Senanayake Political career =Early political activism= Henry Pedris, a Captain in the Colombo Town Guard; was executed by the British on the account of treason. The three Senanayake brothers were involved in the temperance movement formed in 1912. When World War I broke out in 1914 they joined the Colombo Town Guard. The brothers were arrested and imprisoned without charges during the 1915 riots. They faced the prospect of execution since the British Governor Sir Robert Chalmers considered the temperance movement as seditious. He was released on a bail bound after 46 days at the Welikada Prison without charges. Brutal suppression of the riots by the British initiated the modern independence movement led by the educated middle class.The Stalwarts In The Struggle For Independence In Sri Lanka Don Stephen and Don Charles were prominent members of the political party Lanka Mahajana Sabha.

The resignations were withdrawn shortly following settlement with the Governor. World War II RAF Bristol Blenheim bomber takes off from Colombo Racecourse in Ceylon during the war. At the onset of World War II in the far east, on 1 December 1941 a Civil Defence Department was formed with Oliver Goonetilleke as Commissioner. D. S. Senanayake, as Minister of Agriculture and Lands and a member of the Ceylon war council took an active role in food supply and control. He was tasked with many defence projects, including rapid construction of an airfield at the Colombo Racecourse, which he achieved; making it available for the defence of Ceylon during the Easter Sunday Raid. During this time a close relationship developed between Senanayake and the deputy commissioner of civil defence, Dr Ivor Jennings who was the principal of the Ceylon University College. Dr Jennings, an expert on constitutional law, subsequently became Senanayake's adviser on constitutional reforms aimed at gaining independence for the island.'From 'half a loaf' to Independence Gaining independence Independence Square by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester in the presence of D.

Accessed 12 June 2015 This bypassed the Governor, who called for a commission from the colonial office to halt the activities of the ministers. Senanayake resigned from the National Congress disagreeing with its resolution on independence and instead approached the commission with his proposal of dominion status and they accepted the ministers' submissions, publishing these in the Sessional Paper XIV of 1944.J.R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka: 1906‚Äì1956 by K. M. De Silva, William Howard Wriggins, p. 127-8 & 168-70 (Univ of Hawaii) In 1944, the Soulbury Commission was formed. In 1945, he proceeded to London to meet the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Oliver Stanley. On his arrival in London he met instead the newly appointed George Hall who had succeeded Stanley following Labour's win in the 1945 general election. He resigned his ministry in 1946 to push for full independence. That year he formed the United National Party (UNP) by amalgamating three right-leaning pro-Dominion parties. The granting of independence to India in 1947 and the appointment of Arthur Creech Jones as Colonial Secretary gave a new window for Senanayake to push for his case using the new constitution that was recommended by the Soulbury Commission. In the negotiations that followed, the British government accepted Senanayake's proposals for constitutional change and self-rule. Senanayake presented the Soulbury Constitution to the State Council which voted it in with only three votes against it. Parliamentary elections were held from 23 August ‚Äì 20 September 1947. Senanayake was contested for the first time in the Mirigama electorate, having been elected uncontested in all previous elections. He won the seat by a majority of over 16,000 votes against Edmund Samarakkody of the Bolshevik‚ÄìLeninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma. Senanayake's party the UNP fell short of a majority at the general election, but was able to form a government in coalition with the All Ceylon Tamil Congress. On September 24, 1947 he was invited by the Governor General of Ceylon Sir Henry Moore to form the island's first cabinet as its first Prime Minister. On 11 November 1947, Senanayake and Sir Henry signed agreements between Ceylon and Britain including a defence pact and public service agreements that paved the way for independence of Ceylon. The \\"Independence Bill of Ceylon\\" was passed in December 1947. On 4 February 1948, Ceylon marked its independence with a ceremonial opening of parliament.Sinhalese Parties, Country Studies, Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress First prime minister D. S. Senanayake as Prime Minister with his Cabinet. With his accession, Senanayake began the process of establishing institutions needed for an independent state. While most domestic institutions existed, Ceylon remained dependent on Britain for trade, defence and external affairs. He turned down a knighthood, but maintained good relations with Britain and was the first Ceylonese to be appointed to the Privy Council in 1950.D.S. Senanayake ‚Äì A nation‚Äôs father, undisputed leader of all time =National development= He boldly made plans to spread out the population, and his Gal Oya scheme relocated over 250,000 people. He expanded the agrarian policies he had initiated during his tenure as Minister of Agriculture and Lands, a post now held by his son Dudley Senanayake. With a rapidly expanding population and food shortages faced during the war, Senanayake aimed to increase local food production to be self sustainable. Renovation of sites of historic importance in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa took place at this time. Senanayake also proposaled expansion of hydro-electric power in the island. =Citizenship= Senanayake's government introduced the Ceylon Citizenship Act which was passed by parliament on 20 August 1948 and became law on 15 November 1948. Only about 5,000 Indian Tamils qualified for citizenship. More than 700,000 people, about 11% of the population, were denied citizenship and made stateless. The bill had been opposed fiercely in Parliament by the Ceylon Indian Congress, which represented the Indian Tamils, and the Sinhalese leftist parties, as well as the All Ceylon Tamil Congress, which represented the Sri Lankan Tamils, including its leader G.G. Ponnambalam. This was followed by the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act No.3 of 1949 and the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Amendment Act No.48 of 1949Ethnic Conflict of Sri Lanka: Time Line - From Independence to 1999 , International Centre for Ethnic Studies =Foreign policy= Senanayake held the portfolio of Ministry of External Affairs and Defence. He developed Ceylon's post-independence foreign policy, establishing formal relations with foreign nations. Initially gaining membership of the Commonwealth and establishing diplomatic ties other member countries, he established diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan. He established the Ceylon Overseas Service to build a carder of career diplomats. He hosted the Commonwealth Conference of Foreign Ministers, held in Colombo in January 1950. One of the significant outcomes of this conference was the establishment of the Colombo Plan. =Defence= CLI at the Echelon Square. Although Ceylon had maintained a small volunteer force for the defense of coloney, Senanayake introduced the Army Act (1949), Navy Act (1950) and the Air Force Act (1951) establishing the Armed forces of Ceylon. Having engaged in Defence Agreement with Britain when gaining independence, Senanayake retained British bases in Ceylon and gain her assistance in training and arming its new military. =Political challenges= In the early years of Senanayake's premiership he faced opposition and criticism from many of the leftist parties. He soon had difficulties with one of the strongest members of his cabinet and leader of the largest factions of his party, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. Bandaranaike joined his Sinhala Maha Sabha in forming the UNP in 1947 having given the impression that Senanayake would soon retire and he would succeed him. With no signs of Senanayake retiring and conflicts with Senanayake on hard line nationalist policies of he had, in 1951, Bandaranaike resigned from his posts and dissolved the Sinhala Maha Sabha and established the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Senanayake assumed the portfolio of Health and Local Government held by Bandaranaike and began countering his break in parliament for the next few months.Richardson (2005), Paradise Poisoned, p. 145. Death On the morning of Friday, 21 March 1952, Senanayake took his usual pre-breakfast ride on Galle Face Green, a short distance from his official residence Temple Trees. He was riding the one of his favorite horses Chitra a mare belonging to the mounted police. Accompanying him on that day was Sir Richard Aluwihare, the IGP; G.G. Ponnambalam, a cabinet minister and Inspector Eddie Grey. The horse broke into a gallop from a canter and went on for a mile, when suddenly the Prime Minister fell off the saddle. He was taken to a nursing home where he remained unconscious for the next thirty-two hours. It was believed that he had suffered a stroke. He was treated by Dr M. V. P. Pieris, Ceylon's senior surgeon and a team of Professors from the University of Manitoba who had been visiting Ceylon as part of a WHO medical mission. A radio message was sent for Sir Hugh Cairns, who decided to fly out to Ceylon to attend the Prime Minister. Winston Churchill order a RAF Hastings with a double crew to take Sir Hugh. However the aircraft with three more doctors and two nurses was taxiing to take off when the message was received that it was too late as the Prime Minister's situation was deteriorating. Two more neurosurgeons from India and Pakistan had reached Colombo, it was too late. Senanayake died at 3:30 pm on 22 March 1952.In memory of their kindness His remains were taken to Temple Trees, where they lay till the next morning when they were moved to the House of Representatives where it lay in state, with over half a million persons showing their respects. His state funeral followed with over 32,000 people taking part in the funeral procession with the stage barring the coffin drawn by sailors of the Royal Ceylon Navy. The procession ended at Independence Square where the remains were cremated. Personal life Wedding of D. S. Senanayake and Mollie Dunuwille in 1910. Senanayake cared for animals and owned a wide range of pets such as elephants, horses, pigs, cattle; many kept in his estate and at the Bothale Walawwa. A keen horticulturist, he grew orchids and would typically wear an orchid in the lapel of his suit. He suffered from diabetes most of his later life. =Marriage and children= D. S. Senanayake married Molly Dunuwila in 1910. She was the daughter of R. R. Dunuwila, then Secretary of the Colombo Municipal Council and Grace Jayatilaka, daughter of Frederick Jayatilaka of the Ceylon Civil Service and District Judge of Kalutara. They had two sons, Dudley Shelton Senanayake (19 June 1911 ‚Äì 13 April 1973) and Robert Parakrama Senanayake (8 April 1913 ‚Äì 26 April 1986). His eldest son, Dudley Shelton Senanayake, succeeded him as Prime Minister in 1952, followed by his nephew, Sir John Kotelawala (1897‚Äì1980) in 1953, but this nine-year family dynasty ended with the landslide victory of Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike in 1956, campaigning under the \\"Sinhala Only\\" slogan. Dudley Senanayake regained the premiership in 1960, and served again from 1965 to 1970. Rukman Senanayake, one of his grandsons, is a former cabinet minister, former chairman of the UNP, current member of parliament, and assistant leader of the UNP. Legacy Statue of D. S. Senanayake erected in Kandy in 1969. D. S. Senanayake is respected by Sinhalese and some Muslims. However, Tamils were not happy with his citizenship laws, which disenfranchised virtually all Tamils of recent Indian origin living in the central highlands. His bold agricultural plans and pro-Western policies drew criticism for their modern and untraditional nature. Under his family's leadership, Sri Lanka's economy flourished, and he is still known as \\"The Father of Sri Lanka\\". Statues of D. S. Senanayake have been erected in many parts of the island, including one at the Independence Memorial Hall and at the Old Parliament Building, Colombo.Moulding forever The lake created by the Gal Oya Dam has been named as the Senanayake Samudraya after him.

One of the sport's most prolific power hitters of the dead-ball era, in the seven years from 1913 to 1920 he led the National League in home runs six times, in runs batted in, total bases and slugging percentage twice each, and in hits, runs and walks once each. He led the NL in several offensive categories in as the Phillies won the first pennant in the team's 33-year history, and he held the team's career home run record from 1917 to 1924. However, he played his home games at Baker Bowl, a park that was notoriously favorable to batting statistics. Cravath hit 92 career homers at Baker Bowl while he had 25 homers in all his games away from home. Moreover, he was an exceptionally slow base runner; so much so, in fact, that it was actually Cravath about whom sportswriter Bugs Baer famously wrote, \\"His head was sure full of larceny, but his feet were honest,\\"Baer, Bugs (June 24, 1919). \\"Two and Three, Putting the Next One Over\\".

The Harrisburg Evening News. Retrieved July 16, 2020. California Born in Escondido, California, Cravath was the first baseball player from the San Diego area to play in the major leagues. He began his career during a time of independent minor leagues, when not all good players moved quickly to the majors. He entered professional baseball in 1903 with the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League; during 5 seasons with the team, he helped them win two pennants. He batted .274, .270, .259, .270, and .303, with 7, 13, 9, 6, and 10 home runs, and with 51, 50, 32, 39, and 45 doubles. He led the league in doubles twice (1906 and 1907) and also finished third twice. Although he never led the PCL in home runs, he was second in the league three times, third once, and fourth once during his 5 seasons. While playing in California, Cravath reportedly picked up his nickname of \\"Gavvy\\" by hitting a ball that killed a seagull (\\"gaviota\\" in Spanish) in flight. The reporters spelled the nickname \\"Gavvy\\" to emphasize that it rhymes with \\"savvy\\", but Cravath himself spelled it \\"Gavy.\\" Boston, Chicago, Washington, and Minneapolis At the end of 1907, Cravath's contract was sold to the Boston Red Sox, where he would be a 27-year-old rookie in . His lack of speed was compared unfavorably to Tris Speaker and other swift outfielders of the time; Cravath once said, \\"They call me wooden shoes and piano legs and a few other pet names. I do not claim to be the fastest man in the world, but I can get around the bases with a fair wind and all sails set. And so long as I am busting the old apple on the seam, I am not worrying a great deal about my legs.\\" He was hitting .256 with 11 triples in 277 at bats when his contract was sold to the Chicago White Sox in August 1908. After a slow start in Chicago in 1909, he was traded to the Washington Senators, who moved him to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association after only four games. In Minneapolis, Cravath learned to hit to the opposite field to take advantage of the short (279 ft) right-field line at Nicollet Park. That ability would also serve him well with the Phillies, who had a similar short right-field porch only 272 feet from home plate at the Baker Bowl. The 1910‚Äì11 Millers were one of the great minor league teams of all time, and Cravath was their biggest star. In 1910 he led the league in batting average (.326), hits (200), home runs (14), doubles (41), and triples (13). In 1911 he again led the league in the same categories except for triples, with an average of .363, 221 hits, 53 doubles, 13 triples, and 29 home runs. Philadelphia T206 baseball card of Gavvy Cravath The rules of the time did not make it easy for Cravath to move back to the majors. Reportedly, it took a clerical error‚Äîthe Millers inadvertently left out the word \\"not\\" in a telegram‚Äîto get Cravath back to the major leagues. In his second chance with the Phillies at age 31 in , he proved he was there to stay by hitting .284 with 11 home runs and 70 RBI. He was also a more than adequate outfielder, sharing the league lead with 26 assists. In 1913 he enjoyed an even better season, leading the NL in hits (179), home runs (19), RBI (128), total bases (298), and slugging (.568); he also placed second in batting with a career-high mark of .341. He placed second in the voting for the Chalmers (MVP) Award behind Jake Daubert, though some historians think Cravath should have won. Other historians disagree citing the fact that his numbers were largely a product of his tiny home park. He repeated as home run champion in , hitting all of his 19 homers in home games, while again sharing the league lead in assists and finishing second in RBI and slugging. Cravath rounding third after hitting a home run, 1919‚Äì1920. 1915 saw his best season as he hit 24 home runs ( only 5 home runs away from tiny Baker Bowl ), leading the Phillies to their first pennant; he had a 3-run home run in the pennant- clinching game on September 29. He also led the league in runs (89), RBI (115, leading the NL by 28), total bases (266), walks (86), on-base percentage (.393), and slugging (.510, leading the NL by 53 points), and led the NL in assists for the third time. His 24 home runs were the most in the major leagues since Buck Freeman hit 25 for the Washington Senators; he also broke Sam Thompson's Phillies franchise record of 20, set in . He later broke Thompson's career franchise record; Cravath's single-season club mark was surpassed by Cy Williams in , and his career record was broken by Williams in . In the low-scoring 1915 World Series against the Red Sox he hit only .125 (2-16), though he drove in the winning run on a ground out in Game 1, the only Phillies victory. He scored Philadelphia's only runs in Games 2 and 4 (both 2‚Äì1 losses), and Boston won in five games, outscoring the Phillies 12‚Äì10. In Game 5, after the first three Phillie batters reached base, manager Pat Moran gave Cravath the bunt sign on a 3‚Äì2 count for unknown reasons; the slugger rolled the next pitch to the pitcher, resulting in a double play. Regarded as one of the sport's pioneer sluggers of the 20th century, Cravath went on to become the first player to win more than five home run titles. However, his home run total was overwhelmingly a product of the hitter-friendly dimensions of his home park with the Phillies, the Baker Bowl; Cravath hit 92 of his 119 career homers in the Baker Bowl. Although his level of play declined gradually after 1915, he again won the home run title in 1917 and 1918. In , at age 38, he had his last outstanding season, winning his sixth home run title with 12 homers (only 2 homers on the road) in just 214 at-bats while hitting .341 (just .291 on the road). In last place midway through the season, the Phillies fired manager Jack Coombs, and Cravath took his place. After he was invited to return as player-manager in , the Phillies improved to 62‚Äì91, but ended up in last place again. Cravath was criticized for his easygoing style and was released, ending his major league career; he became player-manager for the Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League in 1921. He played his final professional games in 1922 with the Minneapolis Millers. Cravath had a career .287 batting average with 119 home runs, then the fourth most in history, and 719 RBI in 1220 games. Mel Ott eventually tied his NL record of six home run titles; Ralph Kiner broke the record in with seven; and Mike Schmidt now holds the record of eight titles, set with the Phillies in . Cravath's 20th-century record of 119 homers was broken by Babe Ruth in . Cravath returned to California, where he went into real estate and was elected magistrate judge (Justice of the Peace) in September 1927 in Laguna Beach, California; he died there at age 82. His nephew Jeff Cravath was head football coach at the University of Southern California from 1942 to 1950. In a June 27, 2004 interview with the Washington Post, 7-time Jeopardy! champion Tom Walsh, who set the record for wins on the program in January 2004 before Ken Jennings came along later that year and won 74 games in a row, said, \\"I feel like 'Cactus Gavvy' Cravath. Do you know who that is? Right. Nobody does. He's the guy who had the home run record before Babe Ruth came along.\\" In 1985, Cravath was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.https://web.archive.org/web/20090103154712/http://www.sdhoc.com/awards/hall- of-fame/baseball/gavy-cravath/ See also * List of Major League Baseball home run records * List of Major League Baseball doubles records * List of Major League Baseball annual runs batted in leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball player-managers * Major League Baseball titles leaders Literature * William Swank.

The first and greatest bebop baritonist, Chaloff has been described as 'the most expressive and openly emotive baritone saxophonist jazz has ever witnessed' with a tone varying 'between a light but almost inaudible whisper to a great sonorous shout with the widest but most incredibly moving of vibratos.'Brian Davis, liner notes to the 1981 Affinity reissue of Boston Blow-Up! Musical Education Serge Chaloff was the son of the pianist and composer Julius Chaloff and the leading Boston piano teacher, Margaret Chaloff (known professionally as Madame Chaloff). He learned the piano from the age of six and also had clarinet lessons with Manuel Valerio of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.Vladimir Simosko, Serge Chaloff: A Musical Biography and Discography, Scarecrow Press,1998 p9 At the age of twelve, after hearing Harry Carney, Duke Ellington's baritonist, he taught himself to play the baritone. Chaloff later explained to Leonard Feather in an interview: 'Who could teach me? I couldn't chase [Harry] Carney around the country.'quoted by George Simon, Simon Says: The Sights and Sounds of the Swing Era, Galahad Books, 1971, p348 Although he was inspired by Carney and Jack Washington, Count Basie's baritone player, Chaloff did not imitate them. According to his brother, Richard, 'he could play (baritone) like a tenor sax. The only time you knew it was a baritone was when he took it down low. He played it high....He had finger dexterity, I used to watch him, you couldn't believe the speed he played. He was precise. He was a perfectionist. He would be up in his bedroom as a teenager. He would be up by the hour to one, two, three in the morning and I'm trying to sleep and he'd go over a phrase or a piece until it was perfect...I used to put the pillow over my head, we had battles.'quoted by Vladimir Simosko, Serge Chaloff: A Musical Biography and Discography,Scarecrow Press,1998 p11 Essex Street, Boston, with Izzy Ort's on the left From the age of fourteen, Chaloff, was sitting in at Izzy Ort's Bar & Grille a famous live music venue on Essex Street in Boston.

This was followed by jobs in the bands of Dick Rogers, Shep Fields and Ina Ray Hutton. In July 1944, he joined Boyd Raeburn's short-lived big band, where he played alongside Dizzy Gillespie and Al Cohn, who became a lifelong friend.Joop Visser, liner notes to Serge Chaloff: Boss Baritone, Proper Records, 2011 With Boyd Raeburn, in January 1945, he made his first recordings, including 'Interlude' (Dizzy Gillespie's 'A Night in Tunisia'), where his baritone can be heard in the opening section of the song.Alun Morgan, 'Serge Chaloff: An Introduction and Discography', Jazz Monthly, October 1957 While with Boyd Raeburn, Chaloff first heard Charlie Parker, who became his major stylistic influence. Stuart Nicholson argues that, rather than imitating Parker, Chaloff was inspired by his example 'grasping more the emotional basis for Parker's playing and using it as a starting point for his own style.'Stuart Nicholson, 'Serge Chaloff' in Max Harrison (ed),The Essential Jazz Records: Modernism to Postmodernism, 1999, p.179 Richard Chaloff said that his brother 'palled' with (Parker) in New York. Any time he had the chance he would pal with him. He would sit in with him at night....My brother used to say that he was up till 4,5,6, in the morning with the Bird.....All the beboppers found each other out'quoted by Vladimir Simosko, Serge Chaloff: A Musical Biography and Discography,Scarecrow Press,1998 p22 Chaloff then joined the big bands of Georgie Auld and then Jimmy Dorsey, who featured him on a celebrated 1946 recording of 'Perdido'. Alongside his work in big bands, in 1946-7, Chaloff performed and recorded with several small bebop groups. These included Sonny Berman's' Big Eight, Bill Harris's Big Eight, the Ralph Burns Quintet, Red Rodney's Be-Boppers, and his own Serge Chaloff Sextette, which released two 78 records on the Savoy label. Three of the four tunes recorded were written and arranged by Chaloff while the fourth, 'Gabardine and Serge', was by Tiny Kahn. 'All four tunes are daredevil cute and blisteringly fast,' wrote Marc Myers. 'They showcase tight unison lines and standout solos by four of the six musicians, who are in superb form....(On 'Pumpernickel') Chaloff shows off his inexhaustible and leonine approach to the baritone sax.'Marc Myers, 'Serge Chaloff March 47' on the All About Jazz website Serge Chaloff became a household name in 1947, when he joined Woody Herman's Second Herd. This was known as the 'Four Brothers Band', after the reed section, comprising Chaloff, Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Herbie Steward, and a little later Al Cohn. He was featured on many Herman recordings, including 'Four Brothers', 'Keen and Peachy', and had solo features in Al Cohn's 'The Goof and I' and 'Man, Don't Be Ridiculous.' On the latter, he demonstrated 'an astonishing technical facility that was quite without precedent on the instrument.' In 1949, Leonard Feather included Chaloff in his book Inside Be-Bop: 'Great conception and execution, good taste, clean tone and Bird-like style have made him the No.1 bop exponent of the baritone.'Leonard Feather, Inside Be-Bop, J.J.Robbins & Sons, 1949 p.79 Drug Addiction By 1947, Chaloff, following the example of his hero, Charlie Parker, was a heroin addict. According to Gene Lees, Chaloff was the Woody Herman band's 'chief druggist as well as its number one junkie. Serge would hang a blanket in front of the back seats of the bus and behind it would dispense the stuff to colleagues.'Gene Lees, 'A Portrait of Woody', Jazzletter, June 1984Whitney Balliett wrote that Chaloff had 'a satanic reputation as a drug addict whose proselytizing ways with drugs reportedly damaged more people than just himself.' Many musicians blamed him for the drug-related death of the 22-year-old trumpeter Sonny Berman on 16 January 1947. The trumpeter Rolf Ericson, who joined Herman's band in 1950, described the impact of drugs on the band's performances: 'In the band Woody had started on the coast...late in 1947, which I heard many times, several of the guys were on narcotics and four were alcoholics. When the band started a night's work they sounded wonderful, but after the intermission, during which they used the needle or lushed, the good music was over. It was horrible to see them sitting on the stage like living dead, peering into little paper envelopes when they weren't playing.' One night in Washington D.C., Woody Herman had a public row on the bandstand with Chaloff. Herman told Gene Lees: 'He was getting farther and farther out there, and the farther out he got the more he was sounding like a fagalah. He kept saying, ‚ÄòHey, Woody, baby, I‚Äôm straight, man, I‚Äôm clean.‚Äô And I shouted, ‚ÄòJust play your goddamn part and shut up!'....I was so depressed after that gig. There was this after-hours joint in Washington called the Turf and Grid....I had to fight my way through to get a drink, man. All I wanted was to have a drink and forget it. And finally I get a couple of drinks, and it‚Äôs hot in there, and I‚Äôm sweating, and somebody‚Äôs got their hands on me, and I hear, ‚ÄòHey, Woody, baby, whadya wanna talk to me like that for? I‚Äôm straight, baby, I‚Äôm straight.‚Äô And it's Mr. Chaloff. And then I remember an old Joe Venuti bit. We were jammed in there, packed in, and...I peed down Serge's leg. You know, man, when you do that to someone, it takes a while before it sinks in what's happened to him. And when Serge realized, he let out a howl like a banshee.' Chaloff's bandmate, Terry Gibbs, told Ira Gitler stories of his chaotic behaviour: 'He'd fall asleep with a cigarette all the time and always burn a hole in a mattress. Always! In about twelve hotels. When we'd go to check out, the hotel owner ‚Äì Serge always had his hair slicked down even though he hadn't taken a bath for three years...the manager would say, 'Mr Chaloff, you burned a hole in your mattress and...' 'How dare you. I'm the winner of the down beat and Metronome polls. How dare you?'...the manager would always say, 'I'm sorry Mr Chaloff,'...Except one time when the band got off on an air-pistol kick....Serge put a telephone book against the door and was zonked out of his bird...he got three shots at the telephone book and made the biggest hole in the door you ever saw. So when he went to the check out, the guy said, 'Mr Chaloff, it'll cost you.'...He 'how-dared' him a few times. Couldn't get away with it. He said 'Well listen, if I'm gonna pay for the door I want the door.' It was twenty four dollars. So he paid for the door. I happen to be standing close by. 'Hey Terry,' he said. 'Grab this,' and all of a sudden I found myself checking out....We're walking out of the hotel with a door.'Ira Gitler, Swing to Bop: An Oral History of the Transition in Jazz in the 1940s, OUP, 1985, p238\\"> Al Cohn described Chaloff's driving: 'I don't know how we kept from being killed. Serge would always be drunk. He was quite a drinker. Everything he did, he did too much. So one time we're driving, after work. It's four o'clock in the morning, and he makes a left turn, and we're wondering why the road is so bumpy. Turned out he made a left turn into the railroad tracks, and we're going over the ties.' Zoot Sims also talked about Chaloff with Gitler: 'When Serge was cleaned up, you know, straight, he could be a delight, really to be around, a lot of fun. He knew how to handle himself. He had that gift. He could get pretty raunchy when he was strung out, but he could also be charming.' In late 1949, when many big bands were folding for economic reasons, Herman broke up the Second Herd. Fronting a new small band in Chicago in 1950, Herman told Down Beat: 'You can't imagine how good it feels to look at my present group and find them all awake. To play a set and not have someone conk out in the middle of a chorus.' Count Basie's Octet For part of 1950, Chaloff played in the All Star Octet of Count Basie who, like Herman, had broken up his big band. The band comprised Basie, Chaloff, Wardell Gray, Buddy DeFranco, Clark Terry, Freddie Green, Jimmy Lewis and Gus Johnson. The group recorded a handful of sides for Victor and Columbia and was also captured on airchecks. Return to Boston In 1950, Chaloff returned to Boston, where he played in small groups in clubs like the High Hat, Petty Lounge and Red Fox Cafe. A 1950 performance at the Celebrity Club in Providence Rhode Island, was broadcast by WRIV, and has been released on CD as Boston 1950. Playing in small groups gave Chaloff the space to develop a new style of playing. In 1951, he talked about 'getting away from the fireworks that don't mean anything' that had been a part of his style up to that point and 'adding more colour and flexibility to his work.'quoted by Stuart Nicholson, 'Serge Chaloff' in Max Harrison (ed),The Essential Jazz Records: Modernism to Postmodernism, 1999, p.179 His friend Al Cohn observed 'It wasn't until he left the big bands that he really started to develop as a soloist.' Chaloff was now a star, winning the Down Beat and Metronome polls every year from 1949-1953. Yet his drug use and heavy drinking made it difficult for him to keep steady work, and he gave up playing completely in 1952-3. Chaloff's come-back began in late 1953, when the Boston DJ Bob 'The Robin' Martin offered to become his manager. Helped by Martin, Chaloff formed a new group which played at Boston's Jazzorama and Storyville nightclubs. His usual musical partners were Boots Mussulli or Charlie Mariano (alto), Herb Pomeroy (trumpet),and Dick Twardzik (piano). 'He didn't work a lot,' said Bob Martin, 'because the word was out. You had to talk somebody to give him a chance to play. When you got him a gig in a club or a hotel, he would usually mess it up. But when he did show...and got playing...it was,'Stand back, Baby!Sunenblick, liner notes to Boston 1950, Uptown CD Jay Migliori, who played with Chaloff at Storyville, recalled, 'Serge was a wild character. We were working at Storyville and, if he was feeling good, he used to let his trousers gradually fall down during the cadenza of his feature, 'Body and Soul.' At the end of the cadenza, his trousers would hit the ground.' Serge and Boots and The Fable of Mabel In June and September 1954, Chaloff made two recording sessions for George Wein's Boston Storyville label, released as two 10\\" LPs. The first Serge and Boots was presented as a joint album with Boots Mussulli, with accompaniment by Russ Freeman (piano), Jimmy Woode (bass) and Buzzy Drootin (drums). Yet George Wein wrote on the sleevenote: 'An alternate title for this album could be 'Serge Returns'....Each selection in these six was chosen and arranged solely by Serge.'George Wein, sleeve note to Serge and Boots, Storyville 1954 There were five standards and a Chaloff original, 'Zdot', with an ending 'written by a wonderful pianist and teacher, Margaret Chaloff, Serge's mother.'. On the second Storyville album, The Fable of Mabel, Chaloff played in a nine-piece band featuring Charlie Mariano, who composed three of the five originals, and Herb Pomeroy, who provided 'Salute to Tiny', dedicated to the drummer and arranger Tiny Kahn. The ambitious title piece was composed by Dick Twardzik, who described it on the sleevenote: 'The Fable of Mabel was introduced to jazz circles in 1951-52 by the Serge Chaloff Quartet. Audiences found this satirical jazz legend a welcome respite from standard night club fare. In this legend, Mabel is depicted as a woman who loves men, music and her silver saxophone that played counterpoint (her own invention which proved impractical). The work is divided into three movements: first, New Orleans; second Classical; and third, Not Too Sad An Ending. The soulful baritone solo by Serge Chaloff traces Mabel's humble beginnings working railroad cars in New Orleans to her emergence as a practising crusader for the cause of Jazz. During her Paris days on the Jazz Houseboat, her struggle for self-expression is symbolized by an unusual saxophone duet Charlie Mariano and Varty Haritrounian. Mabel always said she wanted to go out blowing. She did.'George Wein, sleeve note to The Fable of Mabel, Storville 1955 The sixth track, Al Killian's 'Lets Jump', was chosen by Chaloff, who said: 'Now that we've proven how advanced we are let's show the people that we can still swing.' Just a month after his second Storyville recording, Chaloff went through a personal crisis. In October 1954, with no money and unable to find heroin, he voluntarily entered the drug rehabilitation program at Bridgewater State Hospital.Richard Vacca, Apr 4-5, 1955: Serge Chaloff‚Äôs Boston Blow-Up, The Troy Street Observer blog, 5 April 2014 After being hospitalized for three and a half months. he was released in February 1955, finally drug free. Boston Blow-Up! left In 1955, Bob Martin persuaded Capitol Records to record a Chaloff LP as part of their 'Stan Kenton Presents Jazz' series. Chaloff's come-back album, Boston Blow-Up! was recorded in New York City in April 1955. He was accompanied by Boots Mussulli (alto), Herb Pomeroy (tp), Ray Santisi (p), Everett Evans (b) and Jimmy Zitano (d). Pomeroy, Santisi and Zitano were already a tight unit, regularly playing at Boston's Stable Club, where they had recorded a live album Jazz in a Stable, on Transition the previous March. The Kenton connection came about through Mussulli, who had played in his orchestra in 1944-7 and 1952-4. Richard Vacca wrote that 'Chaloff still had his bad boy reputation, and the presence of the steady and reliable Mussulli, who had recorded his own 'Kenton Presents' LP in 1954, was a great relief to Capitol.' For the recording, he composed and arranged five new tunes, including 'Bob the Robin', dedicated to Chaloff's manager. Pomeroy arranged the standards. Chaloff described the sessions: 'When I came back on the music scene, just recently, I wanted a book of fresh sounding things. I got just what I wanted from Herb and Boots. I think their writing shows us a happy group trying to create new musical entertainment by swinging all the time. Jazz has got to swing; if it doesn't, it loses its feeling of expression. This group and these sides are about the happiest I've been involved with.'quoted by Chet Williamson,'Serge on Central', Jazz Riffing on a Lost Worcester blog, 20 April 2013 The highlights of the album are Chaloff's powerful ballad features, 'What's New?' and 'Body and Soul'. In the 1956 Metronome Yearbook, Bill Coss described the latter as 'an almost frightening example of Serge's form, moaning through a seemingly autobiographical portrayal of (his) Body and Soul', an enormously emotional jazz listening experience.' Jack Tracy gave Boston Blow-Up! five stars in his Down Beat review: 'Serge, for years one of music's more chaotic personalities, has made an about face of late and is again flying right. It is evident in his playing, which has become a thing of real beauty....Chaloff offers the best display of his talents ever to be put on wax. It swings, it has heart, it has maturity‚Äîit is the long-awaited coalescence of a great talent.' Boston Blow- Up!'s favourable reception brought more work for Chaloff, culminating in a performance at the Boston Arts Festival in June 1955. The show was reviewed in the Boston Herald: 'The ingenuity of Chaloff as a soloist is enormous, and his use of dissonance always conveys a sense of purpose and of form. In 'Body and Soul', he exhibited his capabilities vigorously, taking a deliberate tempo and treating the music with a lyric, delicate, tonal standpoint....the harmonies of the group are tense and the melodies resourceful and they play with a kind of controlled abandon.'quoted by Vladimir Simosko, Serge Chaloff: A Musical Biography and Discography,Scarecrow Press,1998 p87 In 1956, Chaloff worked his way across the country, usually working in an alto/baritone format. In Chicago, he played alongside Lou Donaldson.Michael Cuscina, liner notes to the 1998 Capitol reissue of Blue Serge In Los Angeles, he played with Sonny Stitt, in a band which also included Leroy Vinnegar, the leading West Coast bassist. Blue Serge right Chaloff's Los Angeles appearance led to his recording a second Capitol LP there in March 1956. The drummer was Philly Joe Jones, who was in Los Angeles with the Miles Davis Quintet. Sonny Clark played piano, and Leroy Vinnegar was on bass. Chaloff described the making of the record, called Blue Serge, on the jacket blurb: 'My last record, Boston Blow-up! was one of those carefully planned things....But this time I was feeling a little more easy-going, and I decided to make a record just to blow. I picked out what I felt was the best rhythm section around and told them just to show up...no rehearsals...no tunes set...and trust to luck and musicianship....I'd never worked with these guys before except for jamming briefy with Joe Jones eight years ago, but I knew from hearing them what they could do....We were shooting for an impromptu feeling and we got it. It has more freedom and spark than anything I've recorded before. And I don't think there's a better recommendation than that when it comes to honest jazz.'Jacket blurb to Blue Serge, reprinted on the 1998 CD reissue Vladimir Somosko, Chaloff's biographer, described the results: 'The rapport of the group was as moving as the music, and the net effect was of every note being in place, flawlessly executed, as if even the slightest nuance was carefully chosen for maximum aesthetic impact. This is a level of achievement beyond all but the masters, and from an ensemble that was not even a working group it takes on an aura of the miraculous.'Vladimir Simosko, Serge Chaloff: A Musical Biography and Discography,Scarecrow Press,1998 p92 Definitive Records CD reissue of Blue Serge with Boston Blow-Up! Stuart Nicholson analysed Chaloff's playing on 'A Handful of Stars': 'Paraphrase becomes central to his performance of 'A Handful of Stars' where he scrupulously avoids stating the melody as written. At one point he plumbs the baritone for a bumptious bass note and soars to the top of the instrument's range in one breath, effortlessly concealing the remarkable technical skill required for such seemingly throw-away trifles. This sheer joy at music making seems to give his playing a life-force of its own.'Stuart Nicholson, 'Serge Chaloff' in Max Harrison (ed),The Essential Jazz Records: Modernism to Postmodernism, 1999, p.180 Richard Cook and Brian Morton in The Penguin Guide to Jazz declared the album 'Chaloff's masterpiece' and described it as 'vigorous and moving...'Thanks for the Memory' is overpoweringly beautiful as Chaloff creates a series of melodic variations which match the improviser's ideal of fashioning an entirely new song. 'Stairway to the Stars' is almost as fine, and the thoughtful 'The Goof and I' and 'Susie's Blues' show that Chaloff still had plenty of ideas about what could be done with a bebopper's basic materials. This important session has retained all its power.'Richard Cook and Brian Morton, The Penguin Guide to Jazz, 1992 Spinal Cancer Chaloff continued to work on the West Coast, performing at the Starlite Club in Hollywood in May 1956. That month, while playing golf, he was struck down by severe back and abdominal pains, which paralysed his legs.Vladimir Simosko, Serge Chaloff: A Musical Biography and Discography,Scarecrow Press,1998 p93 Chaloff flew back to Boston, where an exploratory operation revealed that he was suffering from cancer of the spine. His brother Richard described his final illness: 'We took him down there [Massachusetts General Hospital] and they found he had lesions on his spine.....they operated and took most of the lesions away, and then he went on a series of X-ray treatments. Oh they were terrible. He must have had twenty or twenty-five in a row. And in those days they really gave you heavy doses of it. Then occasionally he got spots on the lungs'quoted by Vladimir Simosko, Serge Chaloff: A Musical Biography and Discography,Scarecrow Press,1998 p93 Despite his illness, and the gruelling treatment, Chaloff continued to play live. In New York, on 18 June 1956, a wheelchair-bound Chaloff took part in a recording of Charlie Parker's 'Billie's Bounce' for the Metronome All Stars album. He played alongside Zoot Sims, Art Blakey, Charles Mingus and Billy Taylor. Chaloff's final recording, on 11 February 1957, was for The Four Brothers... Together Again! a reunion album of Woody Herman's Four Brothers for Vik, a subsidiary of RCA Victor. The Four Brothers lineup was Zoot Sims, Al Cohn, Herbie Steward and Chaloff, accompanied by Elliot Lawrence (piano), Buddy Jones (bass) and Don Lamond (drums). On the later recordings, Charlie O'Kane was brought in to play baritone on the section parts, so Chaloff could preserve his strength for the solos. Here his playing was as strong as ever, especially on 'Aged in Wood', written as a solo vehicle for Chaloff by Al Cohn. Richard Chaloff: 'He took a wheelchair down to make that recording, you know. They didn't think he was going to make it. I heard stories from people there. But when he stood up and played, you never knew he was a sick fellow. He played dynamic. If you listen to the record he sounds like the old Serge. He pulled himself together. I don't know how he did it. But he had tremendous drive, tremendous stamina.'quoted by Vladimir Simosko, Serge Chaloff: A Musical Biography and Discography,Scarecrow Press,1998 p95 Don Gold reviewed the album in Down Beat: 'This last session before his death represents a fervent expression of a fatally ill man. It is a kind of significant farewell in the language he knew best.' Chaloff made his last live appearances at The Stable Club on Huntington Avenue in Boston the following May. Interviewed in 1993, Charlie 'the Whale' Johnson recalled Chaloff's final performances: 'I remember pushing Chaloff's wheelchair into The Stable for his last appearances there. He was in bad shape but could still really play, standing leaning on a pillar. However, he didn't have much stamina. He couldn't really finish the gig. I also had to go get pot and booze for him. He was still using these steadily, even in the hospital at the end.' On 15 July 1957, the dying Chaloff was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital. According to Richard Chaloff, he took his horn and pet monkey with him: 'He still had the kinkajou monkey Mother got him to keep him company. And he had his horn. I was told they wheeled him into a vacant operating theatre so he could practise, and that was his last gig, his last public performance, solo baritone sax alone in an operating theatre. Nurses, doctors and even patients were standing outside and listening. He fought it to the end. Mother would visit him and urge him on, saying, 'You can beat it' and things. But that last day, they brought a priest to visit him, and the priest saw Serge in bed looking so wasted, and the priest thought he was supposed to perform the last rites. Serge woke up in the middle of it and really panicked, sliding away from him and yelling 'No! No! Get out!' But after that he seemed to give up. I think that's when he realized it was all over.' Serge Chaloff died the next day, at the age of 33. He is buried in the Forest Hills Cemetery, Jamaica Plain, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

Commonly referred to as the \\"Nickel Plate Road\\", the railroad served a large area, including trackage in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Its primary connections included Buffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Indianapolis, St. Louis, and Toledo. The Nickel Plate Railroad was constructed in 1881 along the South Shore of the Great Lakes connecting Buffalo and Chicago to compete with the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. In 1964 the Nickel Plate Road and several other mid-western carriers were merged into the larger Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;). The goal of the N&W; expansion was to form a more competitive and successful system serving 14 states and the Canadian province of Ontario on more than of railroad. The profitable N&W; was itself combined with the Southern Railway, another profitable carrier, to form Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS) in 1982. At the end of 1960, NKP operated of road on of track, not including the of Lorain & West Virginia. That year it reported 9758 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 41 million passenger-miles.

HGR Industrial Surplus. Retrieved 2016-07-06. History Black River in Lorain, Ohio, 1906 =Background= During the 25 years that followed the American Civil War, railway track mileage in the United States more than doubled, changing the face of America forever. Rail transportation meant that products made in the East could be shipped West for far less than previously. This allowed for an economy of scale - larger, more efficient factories. The agricultural heartland of America was no longer confined to a market of single day's trip by wagon. Railroad and railroad construction became one of the largest industries during that era. By 1881 one out of 32 people in the United States was either employed by a railroad or engaged in railroad construction. Starting about 1877, two great railroad developers, William H. Vanderbilt and Jay Gould, began competing for the railroad traffic along the south shore of the Great Lakes. By 1878 William Vanderbilt had a monopoly on rail traffic between Buffalo, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and Chicago, because he owned the only railroad linking those cities - the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. In addition, he was the richest man in America at that time. By 1881 Jay Gould controlled about 15% of all U.S. railroad mileage, most of it west of the Mississippi River and he was considered the most ruthless financial operator in America. Gould's major railroad east of the Mississippi River was the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway (Wabash). The Wabash mainline ran from St. Louis, Missouri, to Toledo, Ohio, where it was forced to deliver its railroad traffic to William H. Vanderbilt's Lake Shore Railroad for delivery to the eastern United States. Jay Gould and William Vanderbilt together oversaw all east-west rail traffic in the mid- west. The Seney Syndicate, owners of a railroad, the Lake Erie and Western Railroad, were interested in tapping new sources of revenue. The stage was set for the creation of the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad. =Early years= The Seney Syndicate, headed by banker George I. Seney, met at Seney's New York City bank and organized the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company on February 3, 1881. The original proposal for the NYC&StL; was a railroad west from Cleveland, Ohio, to Chicago, Illinois, with a branch to St. Louis, Missouri. On April 13, 1881, the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company bought the Buffalo, Cleveland and Chicago Railway, a railroad that been surveyed from the west side of Cleveland, Ohio to Buffalo, New York running parallel to Vanderbilt's Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. The idea of an east-west railroad across northern Ohio was very popular with the people of Ohio. They wanted to break the high freight rates charged by Jay Gould and William Henry Vanderbilt. No one was less popular in Ohio than William Vanderbilt since the December 29, 1876, collapse of Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway's Ashtabula River trestle, where 64 people had been injured and 92 were killed or died later from injuries. Another reason for the popularity of the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railway was the positive economic impact on cities that any new railroad went through at that time. During a newspaper war to attract the NYC&St.L; the Norwalk, Ohio Chronicle Newspaper referred to it as \\"... double-track nickel-plated railroad.\\" The New York, Chicago and St. Louis adopted the nickname and it became better known as the Nickel Plate Road. It was decided to start building along the surveyed route between Cleveland, Ohio and Buffalo, New York rather than build the branch to St. Louis, Missouri. Five hundred days later the Nickel Plate's single-track mainline from Buffalo, New York to Chicago was complete. The railroad was estimated to require 90,000 long tons (80,000 metric tons) of steel rails, each weighing 60 pounds per linear yard (30 kg/m) and 1.5 million oak crossties. Additionally, the railroad required 49 major bridges. It was characterized by long sections of straight track, mild grades, and impressive bridges. The Nickel Plate ran its first trains over the entire system on October 16, 1882. During construction, Vanderbilt and Gould had watched with great interest. If either of them could acquire the Nickel Plate, they could end the threat to their railroads. If the Nickel Plate remained independent it would be able to create a substantial dent in both entrepreneurs' railroad earnings. Vanderbilt tried to lower the value of the Nickel Plate by organizing a campaign to smear its reputation before a train ever ran on its tracks. If Vanderbilt was successful he could scare the Seney Syndicate into selling to him or drive the railroad company into bankruptcy. However, Vanderbilt's plan came with two important risks. If he slandered the line he risked chasing the Seney Syndicate into an alliance with Gould. The other risk was that his plan to smear the Nickel Plate's reputation might fail and it could quickly grow. Vanderbilt claimed the road was being built with substandard materials and it would use unsafe practices once completed. He succeeded in creating long-standing rumors about the line, but failed to devalue the company or scare the investors. The cost of construction was higher than expected and the Seney Syndicate began to negotiate with Gould to purchase the railroad, but unlike Vanderbilt, Gould lacked the capital. Frustrated at the failing talks, Gould broke off negotiations and gave up on his attempt to break Vanderbilt. =The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern era= In early 1881, William Henry Vanderbilt could have had the Nickel Plate for one million dollars, equal to $ today. He realized if he allowed Jay Gould to gain control of the Nickel Plate his monopoly on rail traffic from Toledo, Ohio - east would be broken. He decided he would do anything to keep the Nickel Plate out of Gould's hands. On October 25, 1882, (a few days after the first trains ran) the Seney Syndicate sold the Nickel Plate to Vanderbilt for $7.2 million, equal to $ today. Vanderbilt transferred it to his Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. However, Vanderbilt had a problem: he could not run the business into the ground or it would fall into receivership and someone else would buy it. He could not close the Nickel Plate either because it cost a fortune to buy. So, the Nickel Plate Road did business, but just enough to keep it solvent. By the advent of the 1920s the Nickel Plate was an obscure line that earned its keep through the transfer of freight from other rail connections. During the same period Vanderbilt's Lake Shore and Michigan Southern prospered and expanded. Vanderbilt kept most of the rail traffic on his Lake Shore and Michigan Southern. Fewer trains on the Nickel Plate meant that they could move faster, so that is the railroad traffic they went after. By 1888 the Nickel Plate had been dubbed \\"The Meat Express Line.\\" Observers at Fort Wayne, Indiana reported six long meat trains every night and a couple of fruit trains during the day. Vanderbilt consolidated many of his railroads into the New York Central Railroad. Over time, the Nickel Plate was reduced as a serious threat to the New York Central and other competing lines. =The Van Sweringen era= The Van Sweringen brothers of Cleveland, Ohio were the next owners of the Nickel Plate. Oris Paxton Van Sweringen and his younger brother Mantis James Van Sweringen were real estate developers who constructed a rapid transit line from their development at Shaker Heights, Ohio to downtown Cleveland. As early as 1909 the Van Sweringen brothers proposed a stub-end terminal on Public Square in downtown Cleveland. The Cleveland interurbans and traction companies were in favor of the new terminal and right-of-ways leading to it. The Nickel Plate was the key. It traversed Cleveland from east to west, had a high level crossing of the Cuyahoga River Valley, and it was adjacent to the proposed terminal. The Nickel Plate also provided a natural route to the proposed terminal for the Van Sweringen's rapid transit and the other traction lines. Between 1890 and 1913 Cleveland had a fourfold increase in population. Civic and political leaders wanted to clean up the city and started many projects. One was a desire to consolidate all of Cleveland's railroad stations. The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Big Four Railroad shared a crowded lakefront Union Station. The Erie Railroad, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Nickel Plate Road, and the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad all occupied separate stations on the north bluff of the Cuyahoga River, just south of downtown. The city also encouraged the railroads to build grade separation throughout the city. The Nickel Plate started a grade separation project on the East Side of Cleveland in 1909 and finished in 1913. Cleveland approved a bond issue in 1910 to \\"depress\\" the Nickel Plate through the most congested part of the West Side. The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway was controlled by the New York Central Railroad's Alfred Holland Smith, a close friend of the Van Sweringens. He had guided the Van Sweringens and even financed their rapid transit to Shaker Heights. In late 1915, the Attorney General of the United States advised the New York Central that its control of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern and the Nickel Plate was in violation of the Federal antitrust laws. Alfred Smith called his friends, the Van Sweringens on February 1, 1916 and offered them the Nickel Plate. They bought it for $8.5 million on April 13, 1916, equal to $ today. In return for operating concessions and access to certain stations, they only put up a little over $500,000 (equal to $ today) but they controlled 75% of Nickel Plate's voting stock. The Van Sweringens had no intention of running the Nickel Plate. Alfred Smith was happy to give the Van Sweringens a vice- president of the New York Central, John J. Bernet, and some of his top men. Smith wanted to show that the Van Sweringens were not New York Central puppets, and the Nickel Plate needed to earn money to retire the $6.5 million in notes owed to the New York Central. =NKP president John Bernet era= During Bernet's reign, the Nickel Plate grew substantially. In 1922, the Nickel Plate purchased the Lake Erie and Western Railroad, giving it access to Sandusky, Ohio and Peoria, Illinois. Later that year, on December 28, the Nickel Plate purchased the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad, also known as the \\"Clover Leaf Route\\", finally giving the Nickel Plate access to the St. Louis area, as well as to the port in Toledo, Ohio. Bernet also doubled the railroad's total freight tonnage and average speeds system wide, while cutting fuel consumption in half. Bernet left the Nickel Plate in late 1926. Bernet returned to the Nickel Plate in 1933. In 1934, Bernet ordered 15 Berkshire locomotives, which would become legendary with the Nickel Plate. Bernet remained as the president of the company until his death in 1935. On December 29, 1937, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway gained control of the Nickel Plate. One major factor was Frank Allen Brown who was the assistant superintendent at this time. Brown held this position from 1937 to 1944. =The War and Post-War era= During World War II, the Nickel Plate, like all other American railroads, found itself helping with the war effort. The Nickel Plate ordered an additional 55 Berkshires during the war. After the war, in 1947, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway ended its control of the Nickel Plate, when it sold off its remaining shares. That year, the Nickel Plate also ordered 11 ALCO PA diesel-electric locomotives, named the \\"Bluebirds.\\" These were the first locomotives for the Nickel Plate that were not painted black since the early 1900s. In 1949, the Nickel Plate received its last Berkshire, #779, also the last steam locomotive built by the Lima Locomotive Works. Later that year, on December 1, the Nickel Plate leased the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. In 1960, the last steam locomotive was retired from service, officially \\"dieselizing\\" the Nickel Plate. Passenger service The Nickel Plate had a few long distance night trains, whose names varied according to whether the train was west-bound or eastbound. The trains linked at Lackawanna Station in Buffalo to continue to Hoboken, New Jersey. *No. 5 City of Chicago (westbound) / No. 6 City of Cleveland (eastbound) (Chicago-Buffalo) *No. 7 Westerner (westbound) / No. 8 New Yorker (eastbound) (Chicago-Buffalo) =The end of an era: merger with N&W;, Norfolk Southern= Nickel Plate train number 5, City of Chicago at Englewood Union Station on April 21, 1965. As the financial situation of American railroading continued to decline after World War II, the Nickel Plate Road together with the Wabash and several smaller carriers merged with the profitable Norfolk and Western (N&W;) on October 16, 1964. N&W; had merged with long-time rival Virginian Railway in the Pocahontas coal region in 1959, and grew through the mergers with other rail carriers including the Nickel Plate and Wabash railroads with operations in adjacent areas of the eastern United States to form a more competitive and successful system serving 14 states and a province of Canada on more than of road. The profitable N&W; was itself combined with the Southern Railway, another profitable carrier, to form Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS) in 1982. Chicago terminals By 1897 the Nickel Plate had obtained trackage rights over the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway from Grand Crossing to its own terminal on the east side of the LS&MS; line to LaSalle Street Station, just north of 12th Street (now Roosevelt Road). By 1928 it used LaSalle. Origin of the Nickel Plate nickname The following is an excerpt from the book The Nickel Plate Road, A Short History of the New York, Chicago & St. Louis R.R. printed in 1954. The book is a record of an address given by Lynne L. White (a former president of the Nickel Plate) to the Newcomen Society of the United States, held in the ballroom of the Hotel Lawrence, Erie, Pa., November 11, 1954. Mr. White was guest of honor at this \\"1954 Lake Erie Dinner\\". :Through northern Ohio, already served by four railroads, location of the line developed intense rivalries among cities. Three routes were surveyed and communities along each proposed route vied in the raising of public subscriptions to donate rights- of-way. The road's general offices at Cleveland frequently were besieged by delegations hoping to bring about the routing of the line through their communities. During these inter-city rivalries was born the nickname for the New York, Chicago and St. Louis - The Nickel Plate Road - which rapidly became the name most commonly used. :Numerous legends have grown about when and how the name \\"Nickel Plate\\" was first applied. The accepted version is that it appeared first in an article in the Norwalk, Ohio, Chronicle of March 10, 1881. On that date the Chronicle reported the arrival of a party of engineers to make a survey for the \\"great New York and St. Louis double track, nickel plated railroad.\\" :Later, while attempting to induce the company to build the line through Norwalk instead of Bellevue, Ohio, the Chronicle again referred to the road as \\"nickel plated\\" - a term regarded as indicative of the project's glittering prospects and substantial financial backing. :In 1882, the Nickel Plate recognized F.R. Loomis, owner and editor of the Norwalk Chronicle, as originator of the term and issued him Complimentary Pass No. 1. :Thus Norwalk named the road - but Bellevue finally got it. To continue the tradition and preserve the history and name of the Nickel Plate Road, on Oct. 1, 2015, HGR Industrial Surplus, current owner of the former General Motors Fisher Auto Body site in Euclid, Ohio, on the Nickel Plate Road line dedicated its site as \\"Nickel Plate Station.\\"Tabasso, Gina. ‚ÄúCome celebrate HGR‚Äôs building dedication on Oct. 1: Big sale, free lunch, prizes and more‚Äù.

The self-proclaimed \\"Rent-A-Yank\\" of the British entertainment industry, he appeared in over 160 films and television programmes from 1957 until his death in 2019, usually playing supporting North American characters. Among his best known roles were the voice of Scott Tracy in the original Thunderbirds series, Air Force Captain \\"Ace\\" Owens in Dr. Strangelove, Joe Donnelli and Malcolm Reid on Coronation Street, Edward R. Murrow in Gandhi, and Louie Watterson on the Cartoon Network series The Amazing World of Gumball. He also made several appearances in the James Bond film series. He also made several on-stage appearances for the Royal National Theatre, and contributed scripts to Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and Joe 90. Early life Rimmer was born Shane Lance Deacon in Toronto, Ontario to a British mother, Vera (n√©e Franklin), and an Irish father, Thomas Deacon, who was a reporter. He had a younger sister, Noreen. He adopted his paternal grandmother's maiden name Rimmer and began his career on Canadian radio as a singer and disc jockey before becoming a television presenter. Career =Film= Rimmer appeared mainly in supporting roles, especially in films and television series produced in the United Kingdom. He emigrated to England in 1959, after initially performing as a cabaret singer. His appearances include roles in films such as Dr. Strangelove (1964), Rollerball (1975), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Gandhi (1982), Out of Africa (1985), Crusoe (1989), Spy Game (2001) and Batman Begins (2005). During his career, Rimmer appeared uncredited in, among other films, You Only Live Twice (1967), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Star Wars (1977) and Superman II (1980). He also is believed to have provided the voice for the character Hamilton (played by Robert Dix) in Live and Let Die (1973).DVD commentary for Live and Let Die =Television= Rimmer had a long-running association with TV producer Gerry Anderson, including the series Thunderbirds (1964‚Äì1966). He was the voice actor behind the character of Scott Tracy. He drafted the story for the series' penultimate episode, \\"Ricochet\\" (1966), from which writer Tony Barwick penned a script. Rimmer thought the studio rates for voices in those days were \\"absolutely deplorable\\". Years after working on Thunderbirds, Rimmer, along with fellow Anderson associate Matt Zimmerman, retained a solicitor. They informed him of the sort of money they received, and the solicitor then gained Rimmer and Zimmerman an immense raise in the residuals.Thunderbirds: A Complete Guide to the Classic Series He also appeared in an episode of Danger Man. He also wrote scripts and provided uncredited voices for Anderson's subsequent Supermarionation productions Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1967‚Äì68), Joe 90 (1968‚Äì69) and The Secret Service (1969), appeared in episodes of the live- action series UFO (1970) and The Protectors (1972‚Äì74), provided voices for Space: 1999 (1975‚Äì77), and guest-starred in one of its episodes, \\"Space Brain\\" (1976). Later, he appeared in the un-televised 1986 pilot Space Police (which was adapted as a full TV series and renamed Space Precinct in the 1990s, though Ted Shackleford replaced Rimmer for the series) and provided the voice of the title character in Dick Spanner, P.I. (1987). Rimmer and American actor Ed Bishop‚Äîhimself an Anderson associate‚Äìwould joke about how their professional paths frequently crossed, calling themselves \\"Rent-a-Yanks\\". They appeared together as United States Navy sailors in The Bedford Incident (1965) and as NASA technicians in the opening of You Only Live Twice (1967), as well as touring together on stage, including a production of Death of a Salesman in the 1990s. Rimmer and Bishop also appeared in the BBC drama-documentary Hiroshima, which was completed shortly after Bishop's death in 2005. He was the 2nd voice of Louie Watterson in the Cartoon Network series The Amazing World of Gumball from 2014 to 2018. The episode \\"The Ghouls\\" was his final role before his death in 2019. =Other work= Rimmer appeared once in Doctor Who (in the 1966 serial The Gunfighters), and twice in Coronation Street: as Joe Donnelli (from 1968 to 1970), who held Stan Ogden hostage before taking his own life, and Malcolm Reid (in 1988), the adoptive father of Audrey Roberts' son Stephen. He made many guest appearances in British TV series for ITV, including Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected, as well as ITC's The Persuaders! In 1980, Rimmer played Edward Condon in the BBC mini-series Oppenheimer, which was rebroadcast in the United States in 1982, and appeared in the 1984 miniseries Master of the Game, opposite Dyan Cannon.

In 2010, Rimmer returned to the world of Thunderbirds with a 15-minute fan film simply entitled Thunderbirds 2010. He portrays Jeff Tracy in a voiceover on Thunderbird 3s radio, towards the end of the movie, instructing Scott and Alan to take the three astronauts they rescued in the movie to an intact space station, and return to Tracy Island in anticipation of a storm in the Pacific. Rimmer played the role of Leo Carlin in the 2013 audio drama The Mighty Carlins by award-winning Canadian playwright Collin Doyle. The recording was produced by Wireless Theatre Company. In 2014, Rimmer released his first fiction novel Long Shot, through amazon.co.uk/com.

Before his playing career he was a schoolmaster, hence his nickname. His most significant actions as a player occurred during the 1925 World Series, where Aldridge completed and won games two and five, only to have the most disastrous first inning in the seventh game of the World Series ever. After his retirement from baseball, he served as a state senator in the Indiana General Assembly. Aldridge is a member of the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame, inducted in 2007.Levenson, p. 26 Personal life Born in the small country town of Cale, Indiana, Vic Aldridge attended the Tempy primary school in Cale, Indiana which was a short walk from his home. He attended high school in Trinity Springs, Indiana where he played baseball on the Trinity Springs team.Dream In The Wilderness, by Doris Price Averitt-Mathews He graduated from Trinity Springs, Indiana. He then attended Central Normal College in Danville, Indiana. In 1914‚Äì1915 he taught school at the Pea Ridge School in Trinity Springs, Indiana.Dream In The Wilderness, by Doris Price Averitt-Mathews. He also taught school in Miami County Indiana. He was married to Cleta B. Wadsworth of Indian Springs, Indiana. Early career Aldridge was a dependable second or third starter throughout most of his career. He was known for his curveball and pinpoint accuracy. Aldridge batted and threw right-handed. He began his pro career by signing a contract with Indianapolis of the American Association in 1915, but first played for Denver of the Western League and then Erie of the Central League. He played for Indianapolis in 1916 where he was scouted for the Chicago Cubs. He was sold to the Cubs on August 28, 1916. Aldridge spent 1917 and 1918 with the Chicago Cubs, serving in the bullpen. In 1917 Aldridge played in thirty games, winning six games and losing six, with a 3.12 earned run average and two saves. In 1918 he played only three games, pitching only twelve innings, before joining the United States Navy during the final year of World War I. After returning from the war, he played for the Los Angeles Angels, an affiliate of the Cubs, in the Pacific Coast League. Aldridge returned to the Cubs for the 1922 season. He played the next three years for Chicago, with consistent performances. In 1922, 1923 and 1924 he played 36, 30 and 32 games respectively, with 16, 16 and 15 wins in the three seasons, with respective earned run averages of 3.52, 3.48 and 3.50. During this time his son Vic Aldridge, Jr. served unofficially as the Cubs batboy and even had a uniform donated by Mordecai Brown so he would look the part.Thomson, p. 203 In 1923 he was ejected from a game. 1925 Vic Aldridge was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates after the 1924 season on October 27, 1924, along with George Grantham and Al Niehaus, for Wilbur Cooper, Charlie Grimm and Rabbit Maranville. The change in stadiums prompted him to rely more on his fastball than his curveball, as he felt he needed to protect himself from home runs in Wrigley Field and its smaller field, thus using the curveball to reduce the risk of being homered against, but the larger field in Pittsburgh made fastballs safer to use, and thus a better pitch to rely upon.James, p. 117 The next year, Aldridge won fifteen games (ninth highest total in the National League in 1925) and lost seven, for a .682 winning percentage that was the fourth highest for any NL pitcher that year. His finest moments were in the postseason that year when he pitched two complete game victories against the Washington Senators as the Pirates won the World Series. He won Game 2 of the series 3‚Äì2 on October 8, and Game 5 by a score of 6‚Äì3, the first two Pirates wins of the Series. Aldridge used the money from the World Series to buy a home in Terre Haute, Indiana.Finoli, p. 366 Aldridge also started the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining for a week in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and drizzle, with a very wet pitching mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success in the first two games to the seventh, but it was not to be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on the slick pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4‚Äì0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9‚Äì7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3‚Äì1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.Koppett, p. 160 Late career The 1925 proved to be the pinnacle of Aldridge's career. In 1926 he suffered a record of 10 wins and 13 losses, with a 4.07 earned run average. The year 1927 was better for Aldridge. He won fifteen games, losing only ten, with a 4.25 earned run average. Aldridge also played in the 1927 World Series, losing the second game of the series 6‚Äì2 as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig led the New York Yankees to a sweep of the Pirates in four games. He gave up all six runs in the 7‚Öì innings he pitched. After several other players had ghostwritten newspaper articles for the Christy Walsh Syndicate, he wrote an article for a Pittsburgh newspaper, who bragged that it was Aldridge himself who wrote it.Montville, p. 262 After winning 15 games again in 1927, Aldridge expected a raise, but instead Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss traded him to the New York Giants on February 11, 1928, for Burleigh Grimes, citing Aldridge's 4.25 ERA in 1927 as a reason not to give him a raise. He held out for much of the year; by the time he returned, he was out of shape and pitched poorly. During the time Aldridge refused to report, Giants manager John McGraw threatened Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to trade him to the Cincinnati Reds. After the season, in which Aldridge's record was four wins and seven losses with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead.Reds Decline McGraw's Offer Of Vic Aldridge in Trade, The New York Times, March 31, 1928. His final game was on August 29, 1928. In total, Aldridge pitched 1,601 innings, won 97 games and lost 80, had 102 complete games and a combined earned run average of 3.76. Rogers Hornsby said that Aldridge had one of the three best curveballs he had ever seen, a curveball described by the Baseball Magazine as a \\"hard, sharp-breaking curve\\" that was one of the best curveballs in all of baseball. He also threw a screwball. His batting average was .229 (133-for-581), a respectable average for a pitcher. He hit two home runs with 60 RBI. Aldridge twice attempted to steal a base, once each in 1922 and 1926, and succeeded both times. Post career After his playing career ended, Aldridge attended law school at the Voorhees School of Law and served in the Indiana State Senate from 1937 to 1948. He was first elected on November 4, 1936, as a Democrat. He served as a schoolmaster full-time before his baseball career, hence his nickname \\"The Hoosier Schoolmaster\\".Democrats Elect Vic Aldridge to Indiana Senate, The Washington Post, November 5, 1936. Aldridge died in Terre Haute at age 79, and is buried in the New Trinity Springs Cemetery of Trinity Springs, Indiana. He was inducted into the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame on January 19, 2007, as its 131st member; his granddaughter, Mary Turner, and grandson, Vic Aldridge III, accepted the award on his behalf.

Compton, who previously led Saint Lucia under British rule from 1964 to 1979, was the country's first leader when it became independent in February 1979. He led the conservative United Workers Party (UWP) from 1964 until 1996, and again from 2005 to 2007. Early life and beginnings of political career Compton was born in 1925 in Canouan, St. Vincent and the Grenadines.CV at government website.Albert Brandford, \\"People's servant to the end\\" , nationnews.com, 9 September 2007. In September 1939, he was taken to Saint Lucia.Biography at government website. While studying law and economics, Compton attended the University College of Wales from 1948 to 1949 and the London School of Economics from 1949 to 1951; he was called to the Bar on 7 August 1951. His political career began in 1954, when he ran as an independent for the seat from Micoud/Dennery in Saint Lucia and was elected. He was appointed to the Executive Council and, under the Committee System then used, became Member for Social Affairs until the end of the Committee System in 1956. In the latter year, he joined the Saint Lucia Labour Party (SLP). He notably participated in a sugar workers' strike in 1957, and was fined for obstructing roads. Re-elected in 1957, he became Minister for Trade and Production in 1958, and also became deputy leader of the SLP, under George Charles. In 1960 he was named Minister of Trade and Industry under Charles, who became Chief Minister. Compton was again re- elected in 1961, but chose not to join the Executive Council; objecting to the choice of ministers, he quit the SLP and along with his supporters he formed a new party, the National Labour Movement, in the same year. In 1964, together with another opposition party, the People's Progressive Party, he and the National Labour Movement formed a new party, the United Workers' Party (UWP). This new party won the election held in June 1964, and Compton became Chief Minister. Administration under British rule, 1964‚Äì1979 In office, Compton worked for Saint Lucia's independence from British rule. When Saint Lucia became an Associated State of the United Kingdom, a move closer to independence that placed the Saint Lucian government fully in charge of the island's internal affairs, on 1 March 1967, Compton became St. Lucia's first and only Premier.\\"Constitutional development\\" , Saint Lucian government website. At the conference leading to this, from April to May 1966, Compton sharply criticized the British government for excluding certain issues, and accused it of favoring \\"second-class citizenship for people of another color\\".\\"John Compton, Prime Minister of St. Lucia, dies at 82\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 8 September 2007. In 1968, he married Barbara Janice Clarke, with whom he would have five children. Following the UWP's victory in the 1974 election, Compton pushed for negotiations leading to independence, which was achieved on 22 February 1979; Compton became the newly independent nation's first Prime Minister. As Prime Minister and in opposition, 1979‚Äì1996 A few months after independence, the UWP was defeated in an election by the SLP, and Compton became Leader of the Opposition. The SLP government collapsed in January 1982, and the UWP won the subsequent election in May 1982; Compton became Prime Minister again. He remained in office until he retired in 1996; he was replaced by his chosen successor, Vaughan Lewis. Compton became a legal consultant. In office, Compton's policies were conservative, pro-Western and anti-communist. He also worked for increased regional integration, and upon leaving office in 1996 he mentioned it as a disappointment that the region's population remained a \\"divided people scattered over the Caribbean Sea\\". Return to politics On 13 March 2005, the UWP elected Compton, then 80 years old, as its leader again at a party convention in Soufriere; he received 260 votes against 135 for Vaughan Lewis.\\"Ex-prime minister regains leadership of St Lucian opposition\\", Caribbean Media Corporation (Bridgetown), 14 March 2005.

His cabinet was sworn in on 19 December; with Compton as Prime Minister and Finance Minister.Anselma Aimable, \\"St Lucia swears in new government ministers\\" , Caribbean Net News, 20 December 2006. As Compton prepared for and campaigned for the 2006 poll, he faced doubts about how capable he was of holding office, considering his advanced age. Compton, however, gave the appearance of being fit and ready for leadership. He was quoted as saying that he was not preparing to run in the Olympics but for leadership of the nation.Donna Sealy, \\"Pa Pa's journey\\" , The Nation (Barbados), 15 December 2006. Election history John Compton dug his political roots in the eastern sugar belt in 1954 and thanks to his involvement in the 1957 sugar strike, they remained planted there throughout a full half century. His immense popularity there was sustained through three generations so much so that when he returned to the fray for the very last time in the elections of 2006, after being 10 years and two elections away, he was bluntly told by supporters that he need not organize any major campaign. The result: Compton easily won the contest by more than 1,000 votes to become the representative of Micoud North for the very first time. Compton as an Independent won his debut election contest in 1954 carrying away 51 percent of the total votes. But after the 1957 strike his personal popularity soared and in successive elections his share of the votes was often in excess of 90 percent. In nearby Dennery, he was able to call the shots there as well as to who should run that constituency. But all that changed in 1979 when Compton's stranglehold on the eastern felt began to flag. In that year, Illness and death On 1 May 2007, Compton was hospitalized in New York City after he suffered a series of strokes which left him physically impaired.Anselma Aimable, \\"St Lucia PM remains in New York hospital after stroke\\" , Caribbean Net News, 18 May 2007.\\"Compton suffered series of strokes\\" , The Jamaica Gleaner, 16 May 2007.

Skittles consist of hard sugar shells imprinted with the letter \\"S\\". The interior consists mainly of sugar, corn syrup, and hydrogenated palm kernel oil along with fruit juice, citric acid, natural and artificial flavors. The confectionery has been sold in a variety of flavor collections, such as Tropical, Wild Berry, Dessert, Sweet Heat and Sour.  History and overview  Skittles were first made commercially in 1974 by a British company. They were first introduced in North America in 1979 as an import confectionery. In 1982, domestic production of Skittles began in the United States. Skittles' \\"taste the rainbow\\" theme was created by New York ad agency D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles. Bilingual (English/French) Canadian packet of Skittles On March 2, 2009, Skittles launched a web-based marketing campaign where their official website became a small overlay with options to view different social media sites in the main area, including its official YouTube channel, a Facebook profile, and a Twitter account. The move was debated by people interested in social media. Skittles marketing has become known for its avant-garde viral marketing techniques, particularly in conjunction with the Super Bowl. In 2018, it produced a Super Bowl commercial that was viewed by only one person. In 2019, it conducted a pre-Super Bowl campaign featuring Skittles Commercial: The Broadway Musical, which was performed one time only at The Town Hall in New York City. Controversy struck over Skittles temporary color change from the candies signature rainbow to white in efforts of supporting the Gay Rights Movement during the 2016 London Pride. Skittles, iconic for its tagline ‚ÄúTaste the Rainbow,‚Äù had been stripped of all color in efforts to promote the legalization of same-sex marriage. The Wrigley Company, a separate representing party of Skittles brand, mass-produced these limited-edition colorless candies in preparation for the month of June, also nationally recognized as LGBT Pride Month. Skittles rainbow themed packaging had also been altered temporarily to complement the achromatic confectionery within. On the back of each monochrome package, the Wrigley Company included an explanation for the company's marketing decision: \\"So this is kind of awkward, but we're just gonna go ahead and address the rainbow-colored elephant in the room. You have the rainbow... we have the rainbow... and usually that's just hunky-dory. But this Pride, only one rainbow deserves to be the centre of attention - yours. And we're not going to be the ones to steal your rainbow thunder, no siree.\\" However, the message intended by the Wrigley Company of promoting the acceptance of nontraditional marriages, was skewed through the candy's representation through the media. The Huffington Post published an article titled ‚ÄúSome People Think Skittles‚Äô All-White Pride Candies Are Racist,‚Äù of which explains that by going all-white the company failed to acknowledge the diversity defined by the LGBT community. Every June, Skittles repeats the colorless marketing to spread Pride awareness. Skittles have been involved in two political incidents in the 2010s. In the aftermath of the shooting of Trayvon Martin, protestors used Skittles, which Martin had reportedly been carrying along with AriZona watermelon fruit juice, as a symbol during rallies. Though Mars' brief statement of condolences was criticized by some outlets, such as Adweek, for being too subdued, Mars' response in 2016 to a Skittles-based image macro (which was posted by Donald Trump's presidential campaign as an analogy for immigration) was praised for its tact and directness. MWWPR said Mars' responses could influence public relations best practices. For Pride month 2020, Skittles changed the color of their candies from a rainbow to all gray, with the tagline \\"Only one rainbow matters during PRIDE\\" https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/us/colorless-skittles- pride-trnd/index.html. The change was temporary, and normal Skittles returned in July 2020. In 2009, animal-derived gelatin was removed from Skittles making them suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Varieties Skittles are produced in a wide variety of flavors and colours, including sour varieties. Skittles has hinted at new flavor releases on its Facebook page, using such statuses as \\"Locking myself in the Rainbow kitchen until I see some results!\\" A 2011 posting contained confirmation of a new flavor: \\"Putting the last touches on a new Skittles flavor. Tweak the Rainbow.\\" In the US, in 2013, Skittles replaced the lime-flavored Skittles with green apple, causing a backlash from some consumers.

Peconic County () is a proposed new county on Long Island in New York that would secede the five easternmost towns of Suffolk County: East Hampton, Riverhead, Shelter Island, Southampton and Southold, plus the Shinnecock Indian Reservation. It derives its name from Peconic Bay which is the dividing body of water separating the North and South forks of Long Island.

In 1997, 71 percent of the east end voters approved a nonbinding resolution to secede. However, the New York State Assembly has never approved the enabling legislation.

Ehud is the founder of the Ba Rock Band and conceived its original artistic program. He is a winner of two ERC (European Research Council) Advanced Grants. Education and Professional background Born in Jerusalem in 1955, the guiding light for Ehud Shapiro's scientific endeavors was the philosophy of science of Karl Popper, with which he became acquainted through a high-school project supervised by Moshe Kroy from the Department of Philosophy, Tel Aviv University. In 1979 Shaprio completed his undergraduate studies in Tel Aviv University in Mathematics and Philosophy with distinction. Shapiro's PhD work with Dana Angluin in Computer Science at Yale university attempted to provide an algorithmic interpretation to Popper's philosophical approach to scientific discovery, resulting in both a computer system for the inference of logical theories from facts and a methodology for program debugging, developed using the programming language Prolog. His thesis, \\"Algorithmic Program Debugging\\", was published by MIT Press as a 1982 ACM Distinguished Dissertation, followed in 1986 by \\"The Art of Prolog\\", a textbook co-authored with Leon Sterling. Coming to the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1982 as a post-doctoral fellow, Shapiro was inspired by the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems project to invent a high-level programming language for parallel and distributed computer systems, named Concurrent Prolog. A two-volume book on Concurrent Prolog and related work was published by MIT Press in 1987. Shapiro's work had a decisive influence on the strategic direction of the Japanese national project, and he cooperated closely with the project throughout its 10-years duration. In 1993, Shapiro took leave of absence from his tenured position at Weizmann to found Ubique Ltd. (and serve as its CEO), an Israeli Internet software pioneer. Building on Concurrent Prolog, Ubique developed \\"Virtual Places\\", a precursor to today's broadly-used Instant Messaging systems. Ubique was sold to America Online in 1995, and following a management buy out in 1997 was sold again to IBM in 1998, where it continues to develop SameTime, IBM's leading Instant Messaging product based on Ubique's technology. Preparing for return to academia, Shapiro ventured into self-study of molecular biology. Shapiro attempted to build a computer from biological molecules, guided by a vision of \\"A Doctor in a Cell\\": A biomolecular computer that operates inside the living body, programmed with medical knowledge to diagnose diseases and produce the requisite drugs. Lacking experience in molecular biology, Shapiro realized his first design for a molecular computer as a LEGO-like mechanical device built using 3D stereolithography, which was patented upon his return to Weizmann in 1998. During the last decade and a half, Shapiro‚Äôs lab have designed and successfully implemented various molecular computing devices. In 2004, Prof. Shapiro also designed an effective method of synthesizing error-free DNA molecules from error-prone building blocks. In 2011, Prof. Shapiro founded the CADMAD consortium: The CADMAD technological platform aims to deliver a revolution in DNA processing analogous to the revolution text editing underwent with the introduction of electronic text editors. In 2005, Prof. Shapiro presented a vision of the next grand challenge in Human biology: To uncover the Human cell lineage tree. Inside all of us is a cell lineage tree the history of how our body grows from a single cell (the fertilized egg) to 100 trillion cells. The biological and biomedical impact of such a success could be of a magnitude similar, if not larger than that of the Human Genome Project. In his TEDxTel-Aviv talk \\"Uncovering The Human Cell Lineage Tree The next grand scientific challenge\\" Prof. Shapiro described the system and results obtained with it so far, and a proposal for a FET Flagship project \\"Human Cell Lineage Flagship initiative\\" for uncovering the Human cell lineage tree in health and disease. Inductive Logic Programming The philosopher of science Karl Popper suggested that all scientific theories are by nature conjectures and inherently fallible, and that refutation to old theory is the paramount process of scientific discovery. According to Popper‚Äôs Philosophy the Growth of Scientific Knowledge is based upon Conjectures and Refutations. Prof. Shapiro‚Äôs doctoral studies with Prof. Dana Angluin attempted to provide an algorithmic interpretation to Karl Popper's approach to scientific discovery in particular for automating the \\"Conjectures and Refutations\\" method making bold conjectures and then performing experiments that seek to refute them. Prof. Shapiro generalized this into the \\"Contradiction Backtracing Algorithm\\" an algorithm for backtracking contradictions. This algorithm is applicable whenever a contradiction occurs between some conjectured theory and the facts. By testing a finite number of ground atoms for their truth in the model the algorithm can trace back a source for this contradiction, namely a false hypothesis, and can demonstrate its falsity by constructing a counterexample to it. The \\"Contradiction Backtracing Algorithm\\" is relevant both to the philosophical discussion on the refutability of scientific theories and in the aid for the debugging of logic programs. Prof. Shapiro laid the theoretical foundation for inductive logic programming and built its first implementation (Model Inference System): a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. Inductive logic programming has nowadays bloomed as a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning which uses logic programming as a uniform representation for examples, background knowledge and hypotheses. Recent work in this area, combining logic programming, learning and probability, has given rise to the new field of statistical relational learning. Algorithmic program debugging Program debugging is an unavoidable part of software development. Until the 1980s the craft of program debugging, practiced by every programmer, was without any theoretical foundation.Silva, Josep. \\"A survey on algorithmic debugging strategies.\\" Advances in Engineering Software 42.11 (2011): 976-991/ In the early 1980s, systematic and principled approaches to program debugging were developed. In general, a bug occurs when a programmer has a specific intention regarding what the program should do, yet the program actually written exhibits a different behavior than intended in a particular case. One way of organizing the debugging process is to automate it (at least partially) via an algorithmic debugging technique.Zeller, Andreas. Why programs fail: a guide to systematic debugging. Elsevier, 2009./ The idea of algorithmic debugging is to have a tool that guides the programmer along the debugging process interactively: It does so by asking the programmer about possible bug sources. Algorithmic debugging was first developed by Ehud Shapiro during his PhD research at Yale University, as introduced in his PhD thesis,Shapiro, Ehud Y. (1983). Algorithmic program debugging. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press. selected as a 1982 ACM Distinguished Dissertation. Shapiro implemented the method of algorithmic debugging in PrologClocksin, William F., Christopher S. Mellish, and W. F. Clocksin. Programming in PROLOG. Vol. 4. Berlin etc.: Springer, 1987. (a general purpose logic programming language) for the debugging of logic programs. In case of logic programs, the intended behavior of the program is a model (a set of simple true statements) and bugs are manifested as program incompleteness (inability to prove a true statement) or incorrectness (ability to prove a false statement). The algorithm would identify a false statement in the program and provide a counter-example to it or a missing true statement that it or its generalization should be added to the program. A method to handle non-termination was also developed. The Fifth Generation Computer Systems project The Fifth Generation Computer Systems project (FGCS) was an initiative by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, begun in 1982, to create a computer using massively parallel computing/processing. It was to be the result of a massive government/industry research project in Japan during the 1980s. It aimed to create an \\"epoch-making computer\\" with- supercomputer-like performance and to provide a platform for future developments in artificial intelligence. In 1982, during a visit to the ICOT, Ehud Shapiro invented Concurrent Prolog, a novel concurrent programming language that integrated logic programming and concurrent programming. Concurrent Prolog is a logic programming language designed for concurrent programming and parallel execution. It is a process oriented language, which embodies dataflow synchronization and guarded-command indeterminacy as its basic control mechanisms. Shapiro described the language in a Report marked as ICOT Technical Report 003,Shapiro E. A subset of Concurrent Prolog and its interpreter, ICOT Technical Report TR-003, Institute for New Generation Computer Technology, Tokyo, 1983. Also in Concurrent Prolog: Collected Papers, E. Shapiro (ed.), MIT Press, 1987, Chapter 2. which presented a Concurrent Prolog interpreter written in Prolog. Shapiro's work on Concurrent Prolog inspired a change in the direction of the FGCS from focusing on parallel implementation of Prolog to the focus on concurrent logic programming as the software foundation for the project. It also inspired the concurrent logic programming language Guarded Horn Clauses (GHC) by Ueda, which was the basis of KL1, the programming language that was finally designed and implemented by the FGCS project as its core programming language. Ubique Ltd. In 1993, Prof. Shapiro took a leave of absence from the Weizmann Institute to found and serve as CEO of Ubique Ltd., an Israeli Internet software pioneer. Ubique was a software company that developed instant messaging and collaboration products. The company's first product, Virtual Places 1.0, integrated in one product instant messaging, voice-over-IP and browser-based social networking on top of Unix-based workstations. These ideas and technologies integrated into one product were novel and revolutionary and perhaps ahead of their time. Ubique, was sold to America Online in 1995, bought back by its management in 1997, and sold again to IBM in 1998. Molecular programming languages In the beginning of the 21st century, scientific progress has successfully managed to consolidate knowledge of the 'sequence' and 'structure' branches of molecular cell biology in an accessible manner. For example, the DNA-as-string abstraction captured the primary sequence of nucleotides without including higher and lower-order biochemical properties. This abstraction allows the application of a battery of string algorithms, as well as enabling the practical development of databases and common repositories. As molecular circuits are the information processing devices of cells and organisms, they have been the subject of research of biologists for many decades. Prior to the advent of computational biology tools, biologists were unable to have access to large amounts of data and their analyses. The mountains of knowledge about the function, activity and interaction of molecular systems in cells remained fragmented. Moreover, these past studies that have identified and connected a few components or interactions one at a time, required decades of serial work. In a seminal paper published in 2002 in Nature magazine \\"Cellular abstractions: Cells as computation\\"Regev, Aviv, and Ehud Shapiro. \\"Cellular abstractions: Cells as computation.\\" Nature 419.6905 (2002): 343-343. Prof. Shapiro raised the question: Why can‚Äôt the study of biomolecular systems make a similar computational leap? Both sequence and structure research have adopted good abstractions: ‚ÄòDNA-as-string‚Äô and ‚Äòprotein-as-three-dimensional- labelled-graph‚Äô, respectively. He believed that computer science could provide the much-needed abstraction for biomolecular systems. Together with his Ph.D. student Aviv Regev he used advanced computer science concepts to investigate the ‚Äòmolecule-as-computation‚Äô abstraction, in which a system of interacting molecular entities is described and modelled by a system of interacting computational entities. He developed Abstract computer languages for the specification and study of systems of interacting computations, in order to represent biomolecular systems, including regulatory, metabolic and signalling pathways, as well as multicellular processes such as immune responses. These \\"molecular programming languages\\" enabled simulation of the behavior of biomolecular systems, as well as development of knowledge bases supporting qualitative and quantitative reasoning on these systems‚Äô properties. The groundbreaking work (that initially used the œÄ-calculus, a process calculus) was later taken over by IBM Cambridge in the UK (Luca Cardelli) that developed SPiM (Stochastic Pi Calculus Machine). In the last decade the field has flourished with a vast variety of applications. More recently, the field even evolved to a synthesis of two different fields molecular computing and molecular programming. The combination of the two exhibits how different mathematical formalisms (such as Chemical Reaction Networks) can serve as 'programming languages' and various molecular architectures (such as DNA molecules architecture) can in principle implement any behavior that can be mathematically expressed by the formalism being used.Chen, Yuan-Jyue, Neil Dalchau, Niranjan Srinivas, Andrew Phillips, Luca Cardelli, David Soloveichik, and Georg Seelig. \\"Programmable chemical controllers made from DNA.\\" Nature nanotechnology 8, no. 10 (2013): 755-762 Doctor in a cell By combining computer science and molecular biology, researchers have been able to work on a programmable biological computer that in the future may navigate within the human body, diagnosing diseases and administering treatments. This is what Professor Ehud Shapiro from the Weizmann Institute termed a \\"Doctor in a cell\\". His group designed a tiny computer made entirely of biological molecules which was successfully programmed in a test tube to identify molecular changes in the body that indicate the presence of certain cancers. The computer was then able to diagnose the specific type of cancer, and to react by producing a drug molecule that interfered with the cancer cells‚Äô activities, causing them to self-destruct. For this work was a member of the 2004 \\"Scientific American 50\\" as Research Leader in Nanotechnology. In 2009, Shapiro and PhD student Tom Ran presented the prototype of an autonomous programmable molecular system, based on the manipulation of DNA strands, which is capable of performing simple logical deductions.Tom Ran, Shai Kaplan & Ehud Shapiro, (2009), Molecular implementation of simple logic programs, Nature Nanotechnology, August, 2009. This prototype is the first simple programming language implemented on molecular-scale. Introduced into the body, this system has immense potential to accurately target specific cell types and administer the appropriate treatment, as it can perform millions of calculations at the same time and 'think' logically. Prof Shapiro‚Äôs team aims to make these computers perform highly complex actions and answer complicated questions, following a logical model first proposed by Aristotle over 2000 years ago. The biomolecular computers are extremely small: three trillion computers can fit into a single drop of water. If the computers were given the rule 'All men are mortal and the fact 'Socrates is a man', they would answer 'Socrates is mortal'. Multiple rules and facts were tested by the team and the biomolecular computers answered them correctly each time. The team has also found a way to make these microscopic computing devices 'user-friendly' by creating a compiler a program for bridging between a high-level computer programming language and DNA computing code. They sought to develop a hybrid in silico/in vitro system that supports the creation and execution of molecular logic programs in a similar way to electronic computers, enabling anyone who knows how to operate an electronic computer, with absolutely no background in molecular biology, to operate a biomolecular computer. In 2012, Prof. Ehud Shapiro and Dr. Tom Ran have succeeded in creating a genetic device that operates independently in bacterial cells.Tom Ran, Yehonatan Douek, Lilach Milo, Ehud Shapiro. A programmable NOR-based device for transcription profile analysis. Scientific Reports, 2012. The device has been programmed to identify certain parameters and mount an appropriate response. The device searches for transcription factors proteins that control the expression of genes in the cell. A malfunction of these molecules can disrupt gene expression. In cancer cells, for example, the transcription factors regulating cell growth and division do not function properly, leading to increased cell division and the formation of a tumor. The device, composed of a DNA sequence inserted into a bacterium, performs a \\"roll call\\" of transcription factors. If the results match pre-programmed parameters, it responds by creating a protein that emits a green light supplying a visible sign of a \\"positive\\" diagnosis. In follow-up research, the scientists plan to replace the light-emitting protein with one that will affect the cell's fate, for example, a protein that can cause the cell to commit suicide. In this manner, the device will cause only \\"positively\\" diagnosed cells to self-destruct. Following the success of the study in bacterial cells, the researchers are planning to test ways of recruiting such bacteria as an efficient system to be conveniently inserted into the human body for medical purposes (which shouldn't be problematic given our natural microbiome; recent research reveals there are already 10 times more bacterial cells in the human body than human cells, that share our body space in a symbiotic fashion). Yet another research goal is to operate a similar system inside human cells, which are much more complex than bacteria. DNA editing Prof. Shapiro designed an effective method of synthesizing error-free DNA molecules from error-prone building blocks.Linshiz, G., Yehezkel, T. B., Kaplan, S., Gronau, I., Ravid, S., Adar, R., & Shapiro, E. (2008). Recursive construction of perfect DNA molecules from imperfect oligonucleotides. Molecular Systems Biology, 4(1). DNA programming is the DNA- counterpart of computer programming. The basic computer programming cycle is to modify an existing program, test the modified program, and iterate until the desired behavior is obtained. Similarly, the DNA programming cycle is to modify a DNA molecule, test its resulting behavior, and iterate until the goal (which is either understanding the behavior or improving it) is achieved. One key difference between the two is that unlike computer programming, our understanding of DNA as programming language is very far from being perfect, and therefore trial and error are the norm rather than the exception in DNA- based research and development. Hence DNA programming is more efficient if multiple variants of a DNA program, also called a DNA library, are created and tested in parallel, rather than creating and testing just one program at a time. Hence the basic DNA programming cycle, when operating in full steam, takes the best DNA programs from the previous cycle, uses them as a basis for creating a new set of DNA programs, tests them, and iterates until the goal is achieved. Furthermore, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is the DNA-equivalent of Gutenberg's movable type printing, both allowing large-scale replication of a piece of text. De novo DNA synthesis is the DNA-equivalent of mechanical typesetting; both ease the setting of text for replication. What is the DNA- equivalent of the word processor? Word processing was rapidly adopted as a replacement for the typewriter when users had discovered its revolutionary advantages in document creation, editing, formatting and saving. While the electronic representation of text in computers allows the processing of text within a simple unified framework, DNA processing the creation of variations and combinations of existing DNA is performed by biology labs daily using a plethora of unrelated manual labor-intensive methods. As a result, so far no universal method for DNA processing has been proposed and, consequently, no engineering discipline that further utilizes the processed DNA has emerged. Prof. Shapiro founded the CADMAD consortium: The CADMAD technological platform aims to deliver a revolution in DNA processing analogous to the revolution text editing underwent with the introduction of electronic text editors. The biotechnology revolution has, to a large extent, been held back by its notoriously prolonged R&D; cycle compared to the computer programming cycle. A CAD/CAM technology for DNA which will bring word processor ease to DNA processing and thus support rapid DNA programming will revolutionize biotechnology by shortening the R&D; cycle of DNA-based applications. This can only be accomplished by concerting the development of complex, multi-layered technologies which integrate expertise from fields as varied as algorithmics, software engineering, biotechnology, robotics and chemistry. These are only now starting to emerge as feasible. Human cell lineage tree In 2005, Prof. Shapiro presented a vision of the next grand challenge in Human biology: To uncover the Human cell lineage Tree. Inside all of us is a cell lineage tree the history of how our body grows from a single cell (the fertilized egg) to 100 trillion cells. The biological and biomedical impact of such a success could be of a magnitude similar, if not larger than that of the Human Genome Project. Every human being starts as a single cell the fusion of an egg and a sperm and progresses via cell division and cell death through development, birth, growth, and aging. Human health depends on maintaining a proper process of cell division, renewal and death, and humanity's most severe diseases, notably cancer, auto-immune diseases, diabetes, neuro-degenerative and cardiovascular disorders, and the multitude of inherited rare diseases are all the result of specific aberrations in this process. The history of a person's cells, from conception until any particular moment in time, can be captured by a mathematical entity called a cell lineage tree. The root of the tree represents the fertilized egg, the leaves of the tree represent the person's extant cells, and branches in the tree capture every single cell division in the person's history. Science knows precisely the cell lineage tree of only one organism a worm called Caenorhabditis elegans that reaches its full size of 1 millimeter and 1,000 cells in 36 hours. By comparison, a newborn mouse, weighing only a few grams, has about 1 billion cells. An average person has about 100 trillion cells. Understanding the structure and dynamics of the human cell lineage tree in development, growth, renewal, aging, and disease is a central and urgent quest of biology and medicine. The challenge of uncovering the Human Cell Lineage Tree is reminiscent, both in nature and in scope, to the challenge faced by the Human Genome Project at its inception and, in fact, its results will decisively contribute to the functional translation and ultimate understanding of the genome sequence. A technological leap of a magnitude similar to the one that occurred during the Human Genome Project is required for the success of the human cell lineage project, and the biological and biomedical impact of such a success could be of a magnitude similar, if not larger than that of the Human Genome Project. Central open problems in biology and medicine are in effect questions about the human cell lineage tree: its structure and its dynamics in development, growth, renewal, aging, and disease. Consequently, knowing the Human Cell Lineage Tree would resolve these problems and entail a leapfrog advance in human knowledge and health. Many central questions in biology and medicine that are actually specific questions about the Human cell lineage tree, in health and disease: * Which cancer cells initiate relapse after chemotherapy? * Which cancer cells can metastasize? * Do insulin-producing beta cells renew in healthy adults? * Do eggs renew in adult females? * Which cells renew in healthy and in unhealthy adult brain? Knowing the Human cell lineage tree would answer all these questions and more. Fortunately, our cell lineage tree is implicitly encoded in our cells‚Äô genomes via mutations that accumulate when body cells divide. Theoretically, it could be reconstructed with high precision by sequencing every cell in our body, at a prohibitive cost. Practically, analyzing only highly-mutable fragments of the genome is sufficient for cell lineage reconstruction. Shapiro's lab has developed a proof-of-concept multidisciplinary method and system for cell lineage analysis from somatic mutations. In his TEDxTel-Aviv talk \\"Uncovering The Human Cell Lineage Tree The next grand scientific challenge\\" Prof. Shapiro described the system and results obtained with it so far, and a proposal for a FET Flagship project \\"Human Cell Lineage Flagship initiative\\" for uncovering the Human cell lineage tree in health and disease.  E-democracy  Ehud initiated in 2012 and led the \\"open party\\" (later \\"open community\\") project within the Public Knowledge Workshop, which aimed to provide foundations for the operation of an e-party espousing direct democracy via the internet. He further extended his concepts of e-democracy in his Davos 2016 WEF lecture and Financial Times Opinion article.

Biography Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he became a professional musician at 15, working in the mid-1940s for the big bands of Jerry Wald, Jimmy Dorsey, Georgie Auld, Elliot Lawrence, Benny Goodman, and Les Brown. He was inspired by hearing Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker to change his style to bebop, moving on to play with Claude Thornhill, Gene Krupa, and Woody Herman. He is Jewish. He accepted an invitation from Charlie Parker to join his quintet. and was a member of the band from 1949‚Äì1951. Being the only white member of the group, when playing in the southern United States he was billed as \\"Albino Red\\" as a ruse to avoid prejudice against mixed race musical combos. During this time he recorded extensively. During the 1950s, he worked as a bandleader in Philadelphia and recorded with Ira Sullivan. He became addicted to heroin and started a pattern of dropping in and out of jazz. During 1969, Rodney played in Las Vegas with fellow Woody Herman colleague, trombonist Bill Harris, as part of the Flamingo casino house band led by Russ Black. Similar work continued through 1972. In the early 1970s he was bankrupted by medical costs following a stroke. He returned to jazz. In 1975 he was incarcerated in Sandstone, Minnesota for drug offenses. While jailed he gave music lessons to guitarist Wayne Kramer of the MC5. He reunited with Ira Sullivan and performed with Dizzy Gillespie. From 1980 to 1982, Rodney made five albums with Sullivan. On these albums he started to play post bop jazz. He continued to work and record into the 1990s. He performed on a Charlie Parker tribute album by Charlie Watts, drummer for the Rolling Stones. He provided an early showcase for saxophonist Chris Potter, who was a member of his group and only 19 years old when Rodney recorded Red Alert in late 1990. He performed at Jazz at Lincoln Center and the JVC Jazz Festival. He worked as an adviser for Bird, a movie about Charlie Parker directed by Clint Eastwood. Michael Zelniker played him in the movie.

It primarily comes from the Colombia's Caribbean region. Vallenato literally means \\"born in the valley\\". The valley influencing this name is located between the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serran√≠a de Perij√° in north- east Colombia. The name also applies to the people from the city where this genre originated: Valledupar (from the place named Valle de Upar ‚Äì \\"Valley of Upar\\"). In 2006, vallenato and cumbia were added as a category in the Latin Grammy Awards. Colombia‚Äôs traditional vallenato music is Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, according to UNESCO. Origins This form of music originated from farmers who, keeping a tradition of Spanish minstrels (juglares in Spanish), who used to travel through the region with their cattle in search of pastures or to sell them in cattle fairs. Because they traveled from town to town and the region lacked rapid communications, these farmers served as bearers of news for families living in other towns or villages. Their only form of entertainment during these trips was singing and playing guitars or indigenous gaita flutes, known as kuisis in the Kogi language, and their form of transmitting their news was by singing their messages. The first form of vallenato was played with gaita flutes, guacharaca, and caja, and later adopted other instruments like guitars. These troubadors were later influenced by Europe's instruments: piano and accordion. Impressed by the sound of the accordion, troubadors probably later obtained accordions from Aruba and Cura√ßao. Vallenato was considered music of the lower class and farmers, but gradually started penetrating through every social group during the mid-20th century. Don Clemente Quintero ‚Äì a prominent member from the region's elite ‚Äì was a lover of this music, usually accompanied by liquor, was a form of entertainment for this almost isolated region. He then decided to start a parranda (party) inside the very strict Valledupar Social Club with friends. This triggered an acceptance for the music and it became a regular feature at parties, carnivals and reunions, not for dancing, but for listening to these juglares stories . Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen, a prominent Colombian politician, showed interest in the region as his ancestors and wife were born there. While a Senator, he pushed for the creation of the Department of Cesar and became, in 1966, its first governor. Once in office and together with writer and reporter Consuelo Ara√∫jo Noguera and vallenato composer Rafael Escalona, they created the Vallenato Legend Festival. Instruments Its three traditional instruments are: * the caja vallenata: a small drum held between the knees and played with bare hands. It was used by the African slaves brought by the Europeans. Similar to a tambora drum. * the guacharaca: a wooden, ribbed stick similar to a sugar cane, accompanied by a fork that when rubbed together emits a scraping sound. It's about 18 inches (45 centimeters) long and 1 inch (3 centimeters) in diameter. It was used by the aborigines to imitate the song of the guacharaco, a bird from the region, to hunt and perform dancing rites. * the accordion: three-line button, German- origin accordion. It has three reeds per note and comes in different tones: ADG, GCF, and BbEbAb (\\"5 Letras\\"). Accordions in Colombia and Panama sometimes have custom made tones especially made for vallenato and cumbia. The four rhythms Vallenato consists of four beats or \\"airs\\" that are differentiated through their rhythmic structure and the melody chord structure the accordionist gives it. These are son, paseo, merengue, and puya. The son and the paseo have a time and the merengue and the puya a time. * Son is played with heavy accentuation and cadence stressed on the low notes of the accordion on its left-hand side. It is normally mournful and slow. * Paseo is thought to be an offshoot of the son. Its speed can vary and today is the most widely recorded air. * Puya's main difference from the merengue is the length of its lyrics. In the last 40 years, accordion players have begun to play it faster, and each of the three instruments used in vallenato has a solo. It is considered the oldest of the four \\"airs\\", with roots in an ancient Indian dance of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. * Merengue is often confused with a Dominican genre with the same name, probably brought by related African tribal groups. It has a more narrative style and was often used to play d√©cimas, a 10-line format with internal rhymes brought by the Spanish in the 16th century. Piqueria The piqueria vallenata is a type of typical musical showdown Colombian Caribbean folklore and Vallenato. As in the contrapunteo Joropo burrowing, or trova paisa within the music, litigants demonstrate their improvisational skills in building verses that challenge their opponent. This type of musical confrontation arose as a result of chance encounters between vallenatos minstrels who roamed the northern part of Colombia brightening binges and to demonstrate their talent on the accordion and the art of improvisation faced with songs and rhymes. One of the most important meetings of the Piqueria was between Emiliano Zuleta and Lorenzo Morales, both vallenato accordionists. From this meeting came the popular song \\"La Gota Fr√≠a\\", played in its most popular version by Colombian singer Carlos Vives. Vallenato festivals Many vallenato festivals are held annually in Colombia, such as: *The Vallenato Legend Festival: Every year by the end of April, in the city of Valledupar, the Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata (Vallenato Legend Festival) is celebrated. During the festival a contest takes place in which the best vallenato interpreters fight for the title of Rey Vallenato (Vallenato accordion King), \\"verseadores\\", new song composers, \\"guacharaqueros\\" and \\"cajeros\\" are also awarded within three categories; professional, aficionado and infant. The festival also includes record industry's orchestras shows. *Accordions' Cradle Festival: (Festival cuna de accordeones) This festival is celebrated every year since 1979, in Valledupar's neighboring town of Villanueva, in La Guajira. The Festival is similar to the Vallenato Legend Festival format, but also includes a category for the elderly accordion players over sixty years old. *Other Vallenato festivals **The Vallenato Festival in Bogot√°, Colombia Vallenato composers, singers and juglares Thanks to the Vallenato Legend Festival, this musical genre became known through the region including regions of Venezuela, and when a popular telenovela, \\"Escalona\\", based on the life of Vallenato composer, Rafael Escalona was aired on national television (with vallenato superstar Carlos Vives as Escalona), vallenato became widely known in Colombia and internationally. Some renowned traditional vallenato performers are Guillermo Buitrago, Alejo Duran, Enrique D√≠az, Emiliano Zuleta, Luis Enrique Mart√≠nez, Abel Antonio Villa and Lorenzo Morales. Other important characters such as Tob√≠as Enrique Pumarejo and Rafael Escalona never played any instrument, but were important writers of very well known songs across Latin America. Other well-known Colombian musicians who sing vallenatos are Diomedes D√≠az, Jorge O√±ate, Ivan Villazon, Nicolas \\"Colacho\\" Mendoza (accordion player and composer), Juan Humberto \\"Juancho\\" Rois (accordion player and composer), Omar Geles (accordion player and composer), Israel Romero, Peter Manjarr√©s, Silvestre Dangond, Rafael Orozco, Los Gigantes Del Vallenato, Galy Galiano, and Lisandro Meza among others. The current ambassador of the genre is Carlos Vives, who has progressively helped vallenato gain popularity worldwide by combining traditional vallenato music with pop/rock music, subgenre that has come to be known as \\"vallenato-pop\\". Vallenato musical orchestras and groups The traditional vallenato developed into a more orchestra type of musical group. Throughout the years, some groups started adding instruments and a group chorus to support the main singer, popularly and sarcastically known as \\"ay omberos\\". With these changes. Some of the instruments added or used by some orchestras were: the bass guitar, the congas drums, a Timbal set, drum kit, maracas, guache, electric piano, Spanish guitars, tambourine, cowbell, electric guitar, Saxophone, piano accordion, violins, among others. These groups also started fusioning local genres to the vallenato, usually with cumbia, porro sabanero, gaitas (group of gaita flute interpreters), merecumbe and joropo. Some groups seeking a wider audience started mixing vallenato with other international genres, like salsa, merengue, rock, classical music, reggae, reggaeton, ranchera, techno and house music. Some of these mixes did not become very popular because of their experimental sounds. = La Nueva Ola (The New Wave) = La Nueva Ola refers to the new generation of vallenato groups and orchestras that have created a distinctive sound for themselves while keeping some of the essence of their predecessors. Kaleth Morales is considered leading artist of this young wave of vallenato musical groups, even after his death following a car accident on August 24, 2005. The leader is now Silvestre Dangond, who won five awards in Premios Nuestra Tierra in 2009.

The removal of fuel ladders is part of defensible space 'firescaping' practices. Fire precautions Potential fuel ladders should be removed to reduce the risk of fire bridging the gap to the canopy. To remove the ladder requires pruning any low limbs up to a minimum of 8 feet, and potentially as high as 15 feet. The required height depends on how low the branch tips hang, the steepness of slope, and the height and spacing of other nearby vegetation. The desired result is to create a situation in which a low-burning fire could burn to the trunk of a tree, which is protected by its bark, without having thinner, more flammable branches, leaves or needles within easy reach of the fire. Other fuel ladders Apart from tree limbs, anything that would help that fire move up into the tree canopy is a fuel ladder. This includes shrubs and even tall grass or weeds. Non-vegetation fuel sources such as woodpiles, wooden fenceposts and structures should also be considered. The intent is to maintain a break in vertical and horizontal continuity so that, if for example a woodpile caught fire, it would not be positioned next to shrubs or directly under trees that could then easily catch fire.

He was a member of the Conservative Party. Early life Manuel Amador Guerrero was born on 30 June 1833 in Turbaco, in the Bol√≠var Department of the Republic of Colombia to Mar√≠a Mercedes Guerrero C√≥rdoba and Jos√© Mar√≠a Amador Leguina. Very little is known about his childhood and teenage years, but he studied to be a surgeon and graduated from the Universidad de Magdalena e Istmo in 1854. Career Amador came to Panama in 1855 settling in Col√≥n and started working on the Panama Railroad as a doctor. After a year, he also took a job as the postmaster. After moving to Santiago de Veraguas, Amador began a export business \\"Amador Hermanos\\", with his brother, Juan De Dios Amador Guerrero, and continued his work as a doctor and in governmental posts. He acted to the District Administration, working on the Municipal Council, and serving as a deputy to the House of Representatives for the Veraguas State in the Republic of New Granada in Bogot√° from 1858 to 1859. During the same period, he began serving in the State Legislature of Veraguas. In 1866, Amador was appointed as the first successor for the Conservative Party, in the elections for the President of the Sovereign State of Panama. When the President Vicente Olarte Galindo died in office in 1868, Amador was to succeed his term as acting president but because he was running in the election, he chose to allow the second successor Juan Jos√© D√≠az to take the post as acting president. When it became evident that Amador's victory was assured for the presidency, General Fernando Ponce staged a rebellion and drove the Conservative supporters out of the capital and back to Veraguas. In the brief battles that occurred, Amador was captured and sent into exile Cartagena. In 1869, Amador returned to Panama, probably settling again in Santiago de Veraguas, where his son was born to Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Terreros. He soon moved to Panama City and began working at the Hospital Santo Tom√°s. The hospital, a charity hospital built in colonial times, suffered from lack of management and funds, and Amador took on the task of managing and reorganizing it without pay for almost two decades of the twenty-nine years in which he worked there. He also opened and ran a pharmacy near the hospital on Avenue B. It is probable his first wife died, as on 6 February 1872, Amador married Manuela Mar√≠a Maximiliano de la Ossa Escobar. With de la Ossa, Amador had two children, Ra√∫l Arturo, who as an adult was attached to the Panamanian consulate in New York City and Elmira Mar√≠a, who married William Ehrman, one of the owners of the Ehrman Banking Company. Return to politics \\"Amador Hermanos\\" brought in brother, Jos√© Amador, and began working with the French company building the Panama Canal in 1879. Simultaneously, Manuel continued his work as a doctor for the Panama Canal Railway and Hospital Santo Tom√°s. In 1886, during the period when Colombia was reorganizing its sovereign states under a federal government, Amador served as the last President of the Sovereign State of Panam√°, taking over the post vacated by on 5 June 1886 and serving until 5 August 1886. During this time frame, Amador served as chairman of the Council of the District of Panama, which had to vote on approval of the Colombian Constitution of 1886. At the end of 1888, the French company which was digging the canal went bankrupt, causing the failure of the Amador brothers' business. Jos√© Amador died soon after the business closed, but Manuel covered the company's losses. Amador favored continuing the canal project and when Lucien Bonaparte-Wyse made the journey to Bogot√° in 1890 to gain a concession for a ten-year extension, he was accompanied by Amador. Instability plagued the French project and then in 1900, the Thousand Days' War erupted between Colombian political factions. The government in Bogot√° asked the United States to protect the railway in Panama, causing the US Marines to intervene on the isthmus. In exchange for keeping the vital transit open, President Jos√© Manuel Marroqu√≠n pledged that he would insure that the United States would receive authorization to complete the canal upon restoration of peace. Amador wrote to President Marroqu√≠n, who was a personal friend, urging the approval of the Hay‚ÄìHerr√°n Treaty. Rather than appointing a favorable candidate, Marroqu√≠n appointed an opponent to the ratification, Juan Bautista P√©rez y Soto as Panama's congressman during the negotiations. Independence movement The appointment caused Jos√© Agust√≠n Arango to recruit his sons, Belisario, Jos√© Agust√≠n and Ricardo Manuel; his son-in-laws Ernesto Tisdel Lefevre, Samuel Lewis, and Raoul Orillac; and a friend, Carlos Constantino Arosemena to begin working on a plan for the independence of Panama. The group was soon joined by Amador, who would become the leader of the independence movement, as well as by Ricardo and Tom√°s Arias, Federico Boyd, Manuel Espinosa Batista, and . Contentious negotiations with Colombia led the United States toward backing the independence movement in Panama, believing that negotiations would be more favorable to American interests from a small, weak, newly developing state, rather than continuing to work with Colombia. Amador traveled to New York in September 1903 to determine how the United States might support the separation movement. After gaining approval for support from the USS Nashville, Amador returned to Panama to get a plan in motion. The USS Nashville landed on 2 November 1903 off the coast of Col√≥n. The following day, 500 sharpshooters, under the command of General Juan B. Tobar traveling aboard the cruiser Cartagena and merchant ship Alexander Bixio, made landfall. Fearing that if they were caught they would be executed, Amador, Arango, Boyd, and Espinosa met to discuss the situation, because with the landed troops many of their colleagues were abandoning the cause. Amador returned home dejected, fearing all was lost, but his wife Mar√≠a de la Ossa came up with a plan to separate the Colombian generals from their troops with help from friends on the railway. She surmised that once the officers were separated and arrested, the troops could be bribed to return home. Amador went out to convince Herbert G. Prescott, assistant superintendent, and James Shaler, superintendent of the Panama Railway to help transport the generals and once he gained their approval, he called the separatists together to get them to endorse the plan. Shaler convinced the generals to go ahead to Panama City without their troops, while the railway was gathering sufficient cars for the troops. When the plan successfully concluded, Panama's independence was proclaimed and the Municipal Council met and confirmed the establishment of the Republic of Panama. Amador and Boyd were sent to Washington, D. C. to negotiate a treaty to complete the canal. When they arrived, they learned that Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla had already signed a treaty and as they were not empowered to accept it, the agreement was sent to Panama for ratification by the provisional government. Presidency On 20 February 1904, the constitutional convention unanimously elected Amador as the first president of the Republic of Panama. Because the Constitution of Panama required that the president be native-born, a clause allowing Amador to serve based on his service to the independence movement was inserted. During his presidency, he established the gold Balboa as the official currency at par with the U. S. gold dollar. His administration adopted the flag, designed by his son Manuel and sewn by his wife and her sister-in-law, Ang√©lica Bergamonta de la Ossa, and the national anthem, that features lyrics written by his wife's brother Jer√≥nimo de la Ossa; created the national theater and national museum; disbanded the army, in favor of a police force; and expanded the educational system in the country. One of the immediate actions of his administration was to resolve a difference in interpretation over the law which created the canal zone, passed on 28 April 1904. Panamanian legislators intended the granting of the zone to the United States to mean that the U.S. could exercise sovereignty \\"only for the purpose of building the canal\\". As the ports were vital for Panama's economy, the government of Panama had no intention of surrendering complete legal or economic sovereignty in the canal zone and did not cede its territory to the U.S. The Americans had established ports, customs houses and postal facilities in the zone, which were objected to by the Panamanians, as they had nothing to do with construction and were functions of a sovereign power. After diplomats were unable to resolve the issue, Secretary of War William Howard Taft was dispatched to meet with Amador, arriving on 27 November 1904. The two devised an agreement whereby the only duty-free goods entering the canal zone ports of Ancon and Cristobal were those that were related to construction of the canal. Other goods were to be taxed by Panamanian authorities at a reduced rate of ten percent ad valorem. In exchange for infrastructure development with hospitals and roads, Amador agreed to allow the Canal Company to control sanitation and quarantine provisions in the zone and utilize municipal buildings. They also designated an agreement for currency sharing and postal regulations, among other revisions. Death and legacy Amador decided not to run for reelection in 1908 and instead retired from public life. He died on May 2, 1909, in Panama City. His last coherent words were to express his wish that the National Anthem be played as his body was lowered into his grave, a wish that was realized.

A native of Greeneville, Tennessee, Alexander played professional baseball, principally as a first baseman, for 20 years from 1923 to 1942, including five years in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers (1929‚Äì1932) and Boston Red Sox (1932‚Äì1933). At six feet, three inches and 210 pounds, he was one of the American League's best hitters from 1929 to 1932. He led the American League with 215 hits as a rookie in 1929, totaled 272 RBIs in his first two major league seasons, and won the major league batting title in 1932 with a .367 batting average. In five major league seasons, he compiled a .331 batting average with 811 hits, 61 home runs and 459 RBIs. In May 1933, Alexander sustained third degree burns on his leg and later developed gangrene after being given diathermy treatment for a twisted knee. The burns and infection limited his mobility and effectively ended his major league career. He continued to play in the minor leagues until 1942, compiling a .334 batting average with 2,145 hits and 1,171 RBIs in minor league play. He also served as a minor league manager for the Sanford Lookouts (1939), Thomasville Tourists (1940), Selma Cloverleafs (1941), Greeneville Burley Cubs (1942), Knoxville Smokies (1946‚Äì1948), and Jacksonville Tars (1950). He also served as a scout for the New York Giants and Milwaukee Braves in the 1950s and 1960s. Early years Alexander was born in Greeneville, Tennessee, in 1903. He was raised on a family farm that had been in his family since the 18th century. He attended Milligan College where he was an outstanding end and punter on the school's football team. He also played basketball and baseball at Milligan and later played baseball for Tusculum College. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= Alexander began playing professional baseball for his hometown team, the Greeneville Burley Cubs of the Appalachian League, in 1923 and 1924. In 1924, he compiled a .332 batting average with 28 doubles and 10 triples in 114 games. He moved on to the Charlotte Hornets of the South Atlantic League, batting .331 in 1925 and .323 in 1926. Alexander next played for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. In 1927, he compiled a .338 batting average with 26 doubles, 11 triples and 12 home runs and 97 RBIs. The next year, he won the International League triple crown with a .380 batting average, 31 home runs, and 144 runs batted in. After his 1929 season, expectations for Alexander were high, with some writers comparing him to Babe Ruth. =Detroit Tigers= On December 5, 1928, the Detroit Tigers purchased Alexander and pitcher Augie Prudhomme from Toronto for $100,000 cash and three players to be named later. In 1929, Alexander won the first base job with the Tigers, starting 155 games at the position. He compiled a .343 batting average, scored 110 runs, and led the American League with 215 hits. He also ranked among the American League leaders with 83 extra base hits (second), 363 total bases (second), 137 RBIs (third), 25 home runs (fifth), a .580 slugging percentage (fifth), 43 doubles (fifth), and 15 triples (fourth). After a tremendous rookie season, comparisons to Babe Ruth continued with one writer even dubbing him the \\"Prince of Swat\\". (opining that Alexander was \\"very likely to become the leading slugger in the American League, the man to don the mantle now worn by Babe Ruth\\") In 1930, Alexander started 154 games at first base for the Tigers and compiled a .326 batting average with 20 home runs and 135 RBIs. In his first two major league seasons, Alexander had 272 RBIs. The only player with more RBIs in his first two major league seasons was Joe DiMaggio in 1936 and 1937. Alexander also had the longest hitting streak of the 1930 season, a 29-game streak in which he had 41 hits in 121 at bats. In 1931, Alexander appeared in 135 games, including 125 games as the Tigers' starting first baseman and four as a starter in left field. He compiled a stunning .490 batting average in the first two weeks of the season. He then had \\"a long layoff\\" in May and June after a spike injury became infected. His batting average dipped to .325 by the end of the season. Though his numbers were less impressive than in his first two seasons with the club, he compiled a .325 batting average, a .401 on-base percentage, and 87 RBIs. In 1932, Alexander lost his job as the Tigers' starting first baseman as Stinky Davis took over the post. During the first two months of the 1932 season, Alexander was used principally as a pinch-hitter and compiled a .250 average in 22 plate appearances in 23 games. =Boston Red Sox= On June 13, 1932, the Tigers traded Alexander with Roy Johnson to the Boston Red Sox, in exchange for Earl Webb, who had set a major league record with 67 doubles in 1931. Webb hit only 19 doubles for the Tigers in 1932 and retired one year later. Alexander won the American League batting crown with a .367 batting average in 1932. He beat Jimmie Foxx by a mere three points, depriving Foxx of the triple crown. Alexander is the only major league batting champion to be traded to another team in the same league during the season in which he won the title (in 1990, Willie McGee won the National League batting title despite being traded to the American League in late August). On August 6, 1932, Alexander broke up a no- hitter by Cleveland pitcher Wes Ferrell, who ended up with a one-hitter. On May 30, 1933, Alexander twisted a knee in a game at Philadelphia. He was given diathermy treatment (\\"electrically induced heat\\" used for muscle relaxation) in the clubhouse by Red Sox trainer Doc Woods. Alexander's leg suffered third degree burns during the treatment, and gangrene eventually set in. \\"It was a new method of treatment and not too much was known about it\\", Alexander said, years later. \\"I noticed my leg felt awfully hot. I ended up with third-degree burns and a gangrene infection and almost lost my leg. I was finished in the Majors... I couldn't run and I couldn't field and when I got hurt, that was the end.\\" Alexander attempted a comeback but injured his leg again in July 1933 and saw limited action for the rest of the season, mostly as a pinch hitter. Alexander wound up hitting .281 in 1933 and played his last major league game on September 23, 1933, against the New York Yankees. =Later career= Minor league player After 1933, Alexander's mobility and fielding suffered, but he was able to hit well enough to continue playing in the minor leagues, primarily as a first baseman, until 1942. Alexander's return to the minor leagues began in February 1934 when the Red Sox assigned him to the Jersey City Skeeters. The following month, he signed a contract to play for the Newark Bears in the International League. During the 1934 season, he appeared in 134 games for Newark, principally as a first baseman, and hit .336 with 123 RBIs, 14 home runs, 35 doubles, and seven stolen bases. On November 3, 1934, the Newark club sold Alexander to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association for a price that was reported to be \\"one of the highest ever paid by an American Association club.\\" He became the Blues' starting first baseman, appearing in 120 games in 1935. He compiled a .358 batting average in 1935 and set a new American Association record by hitting four home runs in a game against Minneapolis on June 14, 1935. In 1936, he appeared in 154 games for the Blues, including 153 at first base, and compiled a .315 batting average with 100 RBIs. In December 1936, the Kansas City club sold Alexander to the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association. During the 1937 season, he appeared in 153 games for Nashville, 153 at first base, and compiled a .319 batting average with 109 RBIs. On February 19, 1938, Alexander signed with the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association. He appeared in 140 games for Chattanooga, 137 at first base, and compiled a .309 batting average with 85 RBIs. Minor league player-manager In February 1939, Alexander, at age 36, was hired as player-manager for the Sanford Lookouts in the Florida State League. Alexander appeared in 98 games as a player, 96 as a first baseman, and compiled a .345 batting average with 80 RBIs and 14 stolen bases. He had the highest batting average on the Sanford team and led the team to a 98‚Äì35 record and a Florida State League championship. He then spent the 1940 season as a player-manager for the Thomasville Tourists in the Georgia-Florida League. He compiled a .388 batting average in 91 games and 330 at bats for Thomasville. In 1941, Alexander was hired as a player-manager for the Selma Cloverleafs of the Southeastern League. He compiled a career-high .438 batting average in 56 games, principally as a pinch-hitter, for the Cloverleafs. In 1942, he returned to the Greeneville Burley Cubs, the hometown team with which he began his career in 1923. He served as a player-manager for Greeneville during the 1942 season. In his final season as a player, Alexander compiled a .158 batting average in 19 at bats. During his minor league playing career, Alexander never hit under .300 until 1942, his final year as a professional baseball player. His minor league batting average was .334 with 2,145 hits and 1,171 RBIs. While serving as manager of the Greeneville club, he also ran an unsuccessful campaign to be elected as the sheriff of Greene County, Tennessee. Tobacco farmer, manager and scout Alexander was not associated with professional baseball from 1943 to 1945, instead operating a tobacco farm in his hometown of Greeneville, Tennessee. He returned to coaching with the Knoxville Smokies from 1946 to 1948. He resigned his position with the Knoxville club on June 5, 1948. After resigning from Knoxville and continuing through the 1949 season, Alexander served as a scout for the New York Giants covering the states of Kentucky and Tennessee. He was assigned by the Giants in July 1948 to manage the Bristol Twins. In June 1950, Alexander was hired to take over mid-season as the manager of the last-place Jacksonville Tars in the South Atlantic League. After retiring as a manager in 1950, Alexander returned to his job as a scout for the New York Giants. He continued as a scout for the Giants for 13 years from 1951 to 1962. He has been credited with signing infielder Ernie Bowman, a native of Johnson City, Tennessee, pitcher Jim Constable, a native of Jonesborough, Tennessee, first baseman Gail Harris, a native of Abingdon, Virginia, and pitcher Joe Shipley, a native of Morristown, Tennessee. He has also been credited with spotting Willie McCovey who grew up in Mobile, Alabama, and began playing in the Georgia State League. In November 1962, he was hired as a scout for the Milwaukee Braves with responsibility for Tennessee, northern Alabama, and southwestern Virginia. Family and later years In the winter between the 1931 and 1932 seasons, Alexander married Verna Hutton from his hometown of Greeneville, Tennessee. He had two sons, Don and Steve, both of whom played baseball. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1970, and died in 1979 at Greeneville, Tennessee, at age 75.

Best known for her monumental work The Rose, DeFeo produced courageously experimental works throughout her career, exhibiting what art critic Kenneth Baker called ‚Äúfearlessness.‚Äù Life and Work = Early Life = Jay DeFeo was born Mary Joan DeFeo on March 31, 1929, in Hanover, New Hampshire, to a nurse from an Austrian immigrant family and an Italian-American medical student. In 1932, the family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where her father graduated from Stanford University School of Medicine and became a traveling doctor for the Civilian Conservation Corps. Between 1935 and 1938, DeFeo traveled around rural parts of Northern California with her parents, and also spent extensive time with her maternal grandparents on a farm in Colorado as well as with her paternal grandparents in the more urban Oakland, California. When DeFeo‚Äôs parents divorced in 1939, DeFeo joined her mother in San Jose, California, where DeFeo attended Alum Rock Union School and excelled in art.Kamin, Diana, and Van Dyke, Meredith George. ‚ÄúChronology‚Äù.

In her artwork, she resisted what she called \\"the hierarchy of material\\", using plaster and mixing media to experiment with effects, a thread one can see running through the art of that time, especially on the West Coast. = Beginning Art Career = In 1953 DeFeo returned to Berkeley, where she created large plaster sculptures, works on paper, and small wire jewelry. She met the artist Wally Hedrick and they married in 1954. At first they lived on Bay Street in San Francisco, close to the California School of Fine Arts, where DeFeo worked as an artist‚Äôs model.DeFeo, Jay. Lecture at San Francisco Art Institute, 11 Feb. 1980. Audio recording. Archives of The Jay DeFeo Foundation, Berkeley, CA. DeFeo focused on making jewelry to support herself, as well as creating small paintings and drawings. It was during this time that DeFeo had her first one-person exhibition at The Place, a San Francisco tavern and poets‚Äô hangout. DeFeo also exhibited her jewelry at Dover Galleries in Berkeley, and was included in many group exhibitions over the next few years.Kamin, Diana, and Van Dyke, Meredith George. ‚ÄúChronology‚Äù.

Later that year, DeFeo and Hedrick moved to 2322 Fillmore Street, into a spacious second-floor flat, where DeFeo was able to work on a larger scale. The Fillmore Street building‚Äîwhose inhabitants at various times included the visual artists Sonia Gechtoff, Jim Kelly, Joan Brown, Craig Kauffman, John Duff, and Ed Moses; the poets Joanna and Michael McClure; and the musician Dave Getz‚Äîbecame a hangout for other artists, writers, and jazz musicians.Kamin, Diana, and Van Dyke, Meredith George. ‚ÄúChronology‚Äù.

Using an experimental approach to each medium, DeFeo developed her own ‚Äúvisual vocabulary,‚Äù playing with scale, color vs. black and white, texture or the illusion of texture, and precision vs. ambiguity.

He espoused a form of African socialism. Youth Ke√Øta was born in Bamako-Coura, a neighborhood of Bamako, which was at the time the capital of French Sudan. His family were Malian Muslims who claimed direct descent from the founders of the Mali Empire. He was educated in Bamako and at the √©cole normale William-Ponty in Dakar, where he was top of his class. Beginning in 1936, he worked as a teacher in Bamako, Sikasso and Tombouctou. His nickname after primary schooling was Modo. Entering politics Modibo Ke√Øta was involved in various associations. In 1937, he was the coordinator of the art and theater group. Along with Ouezzin Coulibaly, he helped found the Union of French West African Teachers. Ke√Øta joined the Communist Study Groups (GEC) cell in Bamako. In 1943, he founded the L'oeil de K√©n√©dougou, a magazine critical of colonial rule. This led to his imprisonment for three weeks in 1946 at the Prison de la Sant√© in Paris. In 1945 Ke√Øta was a candidate for the Constituent Assembly of the French Fourth Republic, supported by GEC and the Sudanese Democratic Party. Later the same year, he and Mamadou Konat√© founded the Bloc soudanais, which developed into the Sudanese Union. Political life In October 1946, the African Democratic Rally (RDA) was created at a conference in Bamako of delegates from across French Africa. While the coalition was led by F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny, Ke√Øta assumed the post of RDA Secretary-General in French Sudan, and head of the Soudanese affiliate: the US-RDA. In 1948, he was elected general councilor of French Sudan. In 1956, he was elected mayor of Bamako and became a member of the National Assembly of France. He twice served as secretary of state in the governments of Maurice Bourg√®s-Maunoury and F√©lix Gaillard. Modibo Ke√Øta became the premier of Mali Federation in 1959.https://www.jstor.org/stable/158851?seq=1 He was elected constituent assembly president of the Mali Federation on 20 July 1960, which consisted of French Sudan and Senegal. Senegal would later leave the federation. President of Mali 1960s commemorative wraps with Ke√Øta's portrait After the collapse of the federation, the US-RDA proclaimed the Sudanese Republic's complete independence as the Republic of Mali. Ke√Øta became its first president, and soon afterward declared the US-RDA to be the only legal party. As a socialist, he led his country towards the progressive socialization of the economy; at first starting with agriculture and trade, then in October 1960 creating the SOMIEX (Malian Import and Export Company), which had a monopoly over the exports of the products of Mali, as well as manufactured and food imports (e.g. sugar, tea, powdered milk) and their distribution inside the country. The establishment of the Malian franc in 1962, and the difficulties of provisioning, resulted in a severe inflation and dissatisfaction of the population, particularly the peasants and the businessmen. In June 1961, he paid a state visit to the United Kingdom, where Queen Elizabeth II invested him as an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George.The Times, 8 June 1961, p. 16; Issue 55102; col. B. Although Ke√Øta was initially viewed with some wariness by the United States because of his socialist views, he made it clear that he sought good relations with Washington. In September 1961, he travelled to America in the company of Sukarno and met with President John F. Kennedy. Ke√Øta, afterward, felt that he had a friend in Kennedy. Modibo Ke√Øta meeting with President Kennedy at the White House in 1961 On the political level, Modibo Ke√Øta quickly imprisoned opponents like Fily Dabo Sissoko. The first post- independence elections, in 1964, saw a single list of 80 US-RDA candidates returned to the National Assembly, and Ke√Øta was duly reelected to another term as president by the legislature. From 1967, he started the \\"revolution active\\" and suspended the constitution by creating the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution (CNDR). The exactions of the \\"milice populaire\\" (the US-RDA militia) and the devaluation of the Malian franc in 1967 brought general unrest. On 19 November 1968, General Moussa Traor√© overthrew Modibo Ke√Øta in a coup d'√©tat, and sent him to prison in the northern Malian town of Kidal. After being transferred back to the capital Bamako in February 1977 in what was claimed to be an action by the government towards national reconciliation in preparation for his release,P. J. Imperato, Mali: a search for direction, p. 69 Modibo Ke√Øta died, still a prisoner, on May 16, 1977.P. Diarra, Cent ans de catholicisme au Mali, p. 273 His reputation was rehabilitated in 1992 following the overthrow of Moussa Traor√© and subsequent elections of president Alpha Oumar Konar√©. A monument to Modibo Ke√Øta was dedicated in Bamako on June 6, 1999. As a Pan-Africanist Keita and Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser (right) in Addis Ababa for the Organisation of African Unity conference, November 1966 Modibo Ke√Øta devoted his entire life to African unity. He first played a part in the creation of the Federation of Mali with L√©opold S√©dar Senghor. After its collapse, he moved away from L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, but with S√©kou Tour√©, the president of Guinea, and Kwame Nkrumah, the President of Ghana, he formed the Union of the States of Western Africa. In 1963, he played an important role in drafting the charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). In 1963, he invited the king of Morocco and the president of Algeria to Bamako, in the hope of ending the Sand War, a frontier conflict between the two nations. Along with Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, Ke√Øta was successful in negotiating the Bamako Accords, which brought an end to the conflict. As a result, he won the Lenin Peace Prize that year. From 1963 to 1966, he normalized relations with the countries of Senegal, Upper Volta and C√¥te d'Ivoire. An advocate of the Non- Aligned Movement, Modibo defended the nationalist movements like the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN). In literature Malian author Massa Makan Diabat√© satirizes Ke√Øta's presidency in his 1979 novel Le boucher de Kouta (The Butcher of Kouta), which features a socialist, dictatorial president named \\"Bagabaga Daba\\" (literally, \\"ant with a big mouth\\"), who is later removed by a military coup.Sangare, Mamadou.

Previously his show has been carried by WSB (AM) Atlanta, WLS (AM) Chicago, the I.E. America Radio Network, the Air America Radio network, Nova M Radio and the On Second Thought network. He is now self- syndicated. Politically, he describes himself as \\"a traditional Liberal Democrat doing his part to return the Democratic Party to its Liberal roots.\\" Early life and career Malloy was born in Toledo, Ohio. His mother was a waitress, and his father was a construction cost analyst. He studied English and political science at North Carolina State University, the University of Toledo, Georgia State University, and Jacksonville University. In the late 1970s, Malloy relocated to Atlanta and became editor of the alternative weekly newspaper Creative Loafing and actor with the Southern Theater Conspiracy. From 1984 to 1987, he was a news writer with CNN, and he was a writer and producer for CNN International in 2000. Radio career Malloy began his radio career in 1985 as an apprentice with Ludlow Porch of WCNN in Atlanta (not related with CNN). Malloy hosted an afternoon (12 p.m. to 2 p.m.) show on WSB in Atlanta from 1986 to 1988 and 1992 to March 24, 1995, until WSB replaced him with the syndicated program of Laura Schlessinger. Malloy's WSB program competed against conservative talk show The Rush Limbaugh Show on rival station WGST. On July 5, 1995, Malloy began a new show in the 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. daypart on WQXI as brokered programming. On October 2, 1996, Malloy began hosting a late-night show on WRFG, a non-commercial FM station in Atlanta known as Radio Free Georgia. During his career in Atlanta, Malloy contributed opinion articles and editorials to the Atlanta Journal- Constitution. In 1997, Malloy began to host a show that aired from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. on the Chicago station WLS. Malloy's WLS program was regularly among the top 25 late-night programs in Chicago. In 1999 and 2000, Talkers magazine ranked Malloy in its Heavy Hundred listing, and Malloy won an Achievement in Radio award for best overnight radio show in Chicago. Malloy's last WLS show was on March 24, 2000. WLS claims that he voluntarily left with mutual consent, but Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn claimed that an executive at the station called Malloy \\"mean-spirited\\" in an e-mail. His program was syndicated between October 2000 and February 2004 on I.E. America Radio Network. The Mike Malloy Show was aired during the 9PM-12AM (ET) timeslot from 2004 until August 2006 on Air America Radio. His time at I.E. America didn't last long. From August to October 2006, Malloy could be heard on the Head On Radio Network. The network rebroadcast Malloy programs from his i.e. America and Air America Radio programs nightly at 10:00 PM. The show was heard on Nova M Radio beginning on October 30, 2006. The show was then briefly heard on the On Second Thought network. Mike Malloy is now self-syndicating his radio program. He is currently being heard in 13 markets across America. Direct listener support is enabled through the sale of podcast subscriptions via his website. Controversy On the date of May 4, 2011, Malloy made remarks regarding the killing of Osama bin Laden, stating: > All the death in Iraq was not caused by bin Laden. The death in Iraq was > caused by George W. Bush. Five thousand Americans, tens of thousands > permanently damaged and shot to pieces, a million Iraqis dead ‚Äì that wasn't > bin Laden. That was George Bush. So when does Seal Unit 6, or whatever it's > called, drop in on George Bush? Bush was responsible for a lot more death, > innocent death, than bin Laden.

Originally a part of the ancient continent of Gondwana, Australia remained connected to India and Antarctica until approximately when India broke away and began moving north. Australia and Antarctica began rifting and completely separated roughly . The Australian plate later fused with the adjacent Indian Plate beneath the Indian Ocean to form a single Indo- Australian Plate. However, recent studies suggest that the two plates have once again split apart and have been separate plates for at least 3 million years and likely longer. The Australian Plate includes the continent of Australia, including Tasmania, as well portions of New Guinea, New Zealand, and the Indian Ocean basin. Geography The northeasterly side is a complex but generally convergent boundary with the Pacific Plate. The Pacific Plate is subducting under the Australian Plate, which forms the Tonga and Kermadec Trenches, and the parallel Tonga and Kermadec island arcs. It has also uplifted the eastern parts of New Zealand's North Island. The continent of Zealandia, which separated from Australia 85 million years ago and stretches from New Caledonia in the north to New Zealand's subantarctic islands in the south, is now being torn apart along the transform boundary marked by the Alpine Fault. South of New Zealand the boundary becomes a transitional transform-convergent boundary, the Macquarie Fault Zone, where the Australian Plate is beginning to subduct under the Pacific Plate along the Puysegur Trench. Extending southwest of this trench is the Macquarie Ridge. The southerly side is a divergent boundary with the Antarctic Plate called the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR). The subducting boundary through Indonesia is not parallel to the biogeographical Wallace line that separates the indigenous fauna of Asia from that of Australasia. The eastern islands of Indonesia lie mainly on the Eurasian Plate, but have Australasian-related fauna and flora. Southeasterly lies the Sunda Shelf.  Origins  Depositional age of the Mount Barren Group on the southern margin of the Yilgarn Craton and zircon provenance analysis support the hypothesis that collisions between the Pilbara‚ÄìYilgarn and Yilgarn‚ÄìGawler Cratons assembled a proto-Australian continent approximately (Dawson et al. 2002).

Section 8 was also often given to cross-dressers, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.Michael Bronski; A Queer History of the United States History The term comes from Section VIII of the World War II-era United States Army Regulation 615-360, concerning the separation of enlisted men from military service. Section VIII provided for the discharge of men who were deemed mentally unfit for military service. The term \\"Section 8\\" eventually came to mean any service member given such a discharge, or behaving as if deserving such a discharge, as in the expression, \\"he's a Section 8\\". Section 8 discharges were often given to gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, cross-dressers, and transgender people, as they were deemed mentally unfit to serve in the military. A Section 8 discharge often made it difficult for people to find work in civilian life and did not allow veterans benefits.Michael Bronski; A Queer History of the United States; Discharge under Section 8 is no longer practiced, as medical discharges for psychological or psychiatric reasons are now covered by a number of regulations.

Plot A pair of explorers, Lewis Moon and Wolf, become stranded in M√£e de Deus (Portuguese: Mother of God), an outpost in the deep Brazilian Amazon River basin, after their plane runs out of fuel. The local police commander wants the Niaruna tribe, living upriver, to move their village so they won't be killed by gold miners moving into the area and cause trouble for him with the provincial government. The commander cuts a deal with Moon: if he and his fellow mercenary would bomb the Niaruna village from the air and drive them away, they will be given enough gasoline for their airplane to be allowed to leave. Born-again Christian evangelist (and missionary) Martin Quarrier and his wife Hazel arrive with their son Billy, here to spread the Christian gospel to the primitive Niaruna indigenous natives. They arrive in M√£e de Deus to meet fellow missionaries Leslie and Andy Huben, who live with a Niaruna helper. In town, they meet a Catholic priest who wants to re- establish a mission to the Niarunas, as the former missionary was killed by them. Moon and Wolf leave in their plane to attack the Niaruna. But upon seeing the community with his own eyes as well as an Indian firing an arrow at the plane, Moon has second thoughts. The plane returns to M√£e de Deus. That night, after a discussion with Wolf, Quarrier and the priest, Moon takes an Indian drug and begins hallucinating. He takes off alone in his plane and parachutes into the Niaruna village. Moon, a half-Native American Cheyenne, aligns himself with the Niarunas. He is accepted as \\"Kisu-Mu\\", one of the Niaruna gods, and begins to adapt to Niaruna life and culture. The four evangelists travel upriver to establish their mission. Indians originally converted by the Catholics turn up, awaiting the arrival of the Niaruna. Eventually they do come and accept the gifts that the Quarriers offer, not staying long. Young Billy dies of blackwater fever (a serious complication of malaria), causing Hazel to lose her sanity. She is returned to M√£e de Deus. Martin becomes despondent, arguing with Leslie and gradually losing his faith. Meanwhile, Moon encounters Andy swimming nude. After they kiss, Moon catches her cold. He returns to the Niaruna camp and inadvertently infects everyone there. Much of the tribe becomes sick. Moon and the tribe's leaders go to the missionary Leslie to beg for drugs. Leslie refuses, but Martin agrees to provide the drugs. He travels to the Niaruna village with the missionaries' young helper. In the village, after Martin speaks with Moon, helicopters arrive to begin bombing. Martin survives the bombing, but killed by his helper soon thereafter. Moon is exposed not as a god but as a man. He runs, ending up alone.

He discovered that MGM owned the rights to Peter Matthiessen's novel. Zaentz continued to try to buy the property every time there was a top executive change at MGM until 1989, when the new studio heads Jay Kanter and Alan Ladd, Jr. decided that MGM would not make the film. Zaentz then paid $1.4 million for the rights.IMDb. Ibid. The picture was filmed in Bel√©m, Par√°, Brazil. It was released to theaters in the U.S. on December 6, 1991. While the film has been released to VHS and Laserdisc, the film was never released on DVD nor Blu-ray in the U.S., but it is available to buy or rent digitally via Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube. Critical reception Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 57% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on reviews from 7 critics. Noted Chicago Sun Times critic Roger Ebert had read the novel and believed the film is true to its themes. Ebert makes the case that producer Saul Zaentz has a history of producing \\"unfilmable\\" source material. He wrote, \\"Watching it, we are looking at a morality play about a world in which sincere people create unwitting mischief so that evil people can have their way. The movie essentially argues that all peoples have a right to worship their own gods without interference, but it goes further to observe that if your god lives in the land and the trees, then if we destroy your land, we kill your god. These messages are buried in the very fabric of the film, in the way it was shot, in its use of locations, and we are not told them, we absorb them.\\"Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun-Times, film review, December 6, 1991. Accessed: July 30, 2013. Vincent Canby of The New York Times had mixed feelings about the film but did like the acting and the screenplay, and wrote, \\"At Play in the Fields of the Lord doesn't play smoothly, but it often plays well ... Mr. Lithgow and Miss Hannah, who grows more secure as an actress with every film, are fine in complex roles that are exceptionally well written ... Though the film features a spectacular penultimate sequence, it seems not to know how to end. It sort of drifts away, perhaps trying to soften its own well-earned pessimism.\\"Canby, Vincent.

Fort Lauderdale, Florida Housing Authority Director William H. Lindsey, upon the advice of Housing Authority attorney J. Richard Smith, initially developed 11(b) financing in the early 1970s to accommodate a local savings and loan interested in assisting with urban renewal projects Mr. Lindsey eventually brought to fruition. This was the initial impetus for the subsequent development of the now well known Section 8 Program. Of the 5.2 million American Households that received rental assistance in 2018, approximately 1.2 million of those households received a Section 8-based voucher. 68% of total rental assistance in the United States goes to seniors, children, and those with disabilities. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development manages Section 8 programs. Programs of HUD , HUD. The Housing Choice Voucher Program provides \\"tenant-based\\" rental assistance, so a tenant can move from one unit of at least minimum housing quality to another. Landlords are not required to participate in the voucher program. Some states have laws that prevent landlords from discriminating based on 'source of income'. These laws are not applicable in all areas, and the program remains voluntary in most places. The program also allows individuals to apply their monthly voucher towards the purchase of a home, with over $17 billion going towards such purchases each year. Voucher amounts vary depending on city or county, size of unit, and other factors. Once individuals receive a voucher they have a limited amount of time to find a unit with a willing landlord that meets HUD housing standards. There are often long wait lists for Section 8 vouchers. Voucher amounts are based on Fair Market Rents (FMRs) calculated in the area by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Recently, a Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs) program was established to reduce the area that rents are based on to the area of zip codes in major metropolitan areas. Section 8 also authorizes a variety of \\"project-based\\" rental assistance programs, under which the owner reserves some or all of the units in a building for low-income tenants in return for a federal government guarantee to make up the difference between the tenant's contribution and the rent amount in the owner's contract with the government. A tenant who leaves a subsidized project will lose access to the project-based subsidy. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have created a program called Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH), or HUD-VASH, which distributes roughly 10,000 vouchers per year at a cost of roughly $75 million per year to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable U.S. armed forces veterans. This program was created to pair HUD-funded vouchers with VA-funded services such as health care, counseling, and case management. History Federal housing assistance programs started during the Great Depression. In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government created subsidy programs to increase the production of low- income housing and to help families pay their rent. In 1965, the Section 236 Leased Housing Program amended the U.S. Housing Act. This subsidy program, the predecessor to the modern program, was not a pure housing allowance program. Housing authorities selected eligible families from their waiting list, placed them in housing from a master list of available units, and determined the rent that tenants would have to pay. The housing authority would then sign a lease with the private landlord and pay the difference between the tenant's rent and the market rate for the same size unit. In the agreement with the private landlord, housing authorities agreed to perform regular building maintenance and leasing functions for Section 236 tenants, and annually reviewed the tenant's income for program eligibility and rent calculations. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 introduced the federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program (EHAP) and the Community Development Corporation and authorized larger outlays for housing subsidy programs and rent supplements for moderate-income households.\\"HUD History\\" , HUD websiteWinnick, Louis, \\"The Triumph of Housing Allowance Programs: How a Fundamental Policy Conflict Was Resolved\\" , Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research, Volume 1, Number 3, September 1995, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research In the 1970s, when studies showed that the worst housing problem afflicting low-income people was no longer substandard housing, but the high percentage of income spent on housing, Congress passed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, further amending the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 to create the Section 8 Program. In the Section 8 Program, tenants pay about 30 percent of their income for rent, while the rest of the rent is paid with federal money. The Section 8 program initially had three subprograms‚ÄîNew Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, and Existing Housing Certificate programs. The Moderate Rehabilitation Program was added in 1978, the Voucher Program in 1983, and the Project-based Certificate program in 1991. The number of units a local housing authority can subsidize under its Section 8 programs is determined by Congressional funding. Since its inception, some Section 8 programs have been phased out and new ones created, although Congress has always renewed existing subsidies. The 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (Public Law 110-161) enacted December 26, 2007, allocated $75 million funding for the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) voucher program, authorized under section 8(o)(19) of the United States Housing Act of 1937. This new program combines HUD Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance for homeless veterans with case management and clinical service support which is provided by Veterans Affairs administration at its own medical centers and also in the community.HUD, \\"Overview of HUD-VASH Vouchers\\" ‚Äì U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Summary The main Section 8 program involves the voucher program. A voucher may be either \\"project-based\\"‚Äîwhere its use is limited to a specific apartment complex (public housing agencies (PHAs) may reserve up to 20% of its vouchers as suchHUD, \\"Project Based Vouchers\\" \\"Project-based vouchers are a component of a public housing agency's (PHAs) housing choice voucher program. A PHA can attach up to 20 percent of its voucher assistance to specific housing units if the owner agrees to either rehabilitate or construct the units, or the owner agrees to set aside a portion of the units in an existing development.\\")‚Äîor \\"tenant-based\\", where the tenant is free to choose a unit in the private sector, is not limited to specific complexes, and may reside anywhere in the United States (including Puerto Rico) where a PHA operates a Section 8 program. Under the voucher program, individuals or families with a voucher find and lease a unit (either in a specified complex or in the private sector) and pay a portion of the rent. Most households pay 30% of their adjusted income for Section 8 housing. Adjusted income is a household's gross (total) income minus deductions for dependents under 18 years of age, full-time students, disabled persons, or an elderly household, and certain disability assistance and medical expenses.\\"Section 8 Rent\\", massresources.org There is an asset test in addition to earned income. Over a certain amount, HUD will add income even if the Section 8 tenant does not receive any interest income from, for example, a bank account.Steinberg, Jessica, Esq., \\"The Income and Assets Test for Section 8 Housing\\" , Legal Network News, California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform (CANHR), Winter 2004. \\"If a family's net assets are worth more than $5000, the family must count toward annual income the greater of either (1) all income derived from the assets, or (2) a percentage of the total value of the assets based on the passbook savings rate, as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) each year. The PHA will never count the full cash value of the asset toward annual income.\\" HUD, \\"Housing Choice Voucher Program Guidebook\\" , Chapter 5: Eligibility and Denial of Assistance, pp. 5‚Äì24. January 10, 2008 version. \\"Calculation When Assets Exceed $5,000: When net family assets are $5,000 or less, use the actual income from assets. When family assets are more than $5,000, use the greater of: Actual income from assets; or A percentage of the value of such assets based upon the current passbook savings rate as established by HUD. This is called imputed income from assets.\\" HUD calls this \\"imputed income from assets\\" and, in the case of a bank account, HUD establishes a standard \\"Passbook Savings Rate\\" to calculate the imputed income from the asset.\\"Passbook Savings Rate ‚Äì Section 8\\" {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120071113/http://www.workworld.org/wwwebhelp/passbook_savings_rate_section_8.htm date=November 20, 2008}HUD, \\"Public Housing Occupancy Guidebook\\" . \\"Public Housing Passbook Savings Rate\\" Another conforming change is related to the passbook savings rate. The Public Housing Occupancy Guidebook suggests that PHAs use a new rate of 2% to be consistent with Multi-Family Housing's passbook savings rate policy. However, as the Office of Housing is updating the passbook savings rate, therefore, PHAs should continue to implement PIH's current policy regarding the passbook savings rate until further notice.\\" By increasing the amount of a tenant's total income, the amount of imputed income from assets may affect a tenant's assigned portion of rent. The PHA pays the landlord the remainder of the rent. Each year, the federal government looks at the rents being charged for privately owned apartments in different communities, as well as the costs of utilities (heat, electricity, etc.) in those communities. The Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are amounts (rents plus utilities) for medium-quality apartments of different sizes in a particular community. As an example, 2012 FMR for 1 bedroom housing in San Francisco is $1,522 and in New York is $1,280, while in many other places it is less than $500.\\"SCHEDULE B ‚Äì FY 2012 Final FAIR MARKET RENTS FOR EXISTING HOUSING\\" , HUD The landlord cannot charge a Section 8 tenant more than a reasonable rent and cannot accept payments outside the contract.See Part B, 6(a), of Housing Assistance Payments Contract (HAP) Contract Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance Housing Choice Voucher Program Landlords, although required to meet fair housing laws, are not required to participate in the Section 8 program. As a result, some landlords will not accept a Section 8 tenant. This can be attributed to such factors as: * not wanting the government involved in their business, such as having a full inspection of their premises by government workers for HUD's Housing Quality Standards (HQS) and the possible remediations required\\"Landlord Key To DCHA Section 8 Voucher Program\\" , Dane County Housing Authority, Monona, Wisconsin. * a desire to charge a rent for the unit above FMR Depending on state laws, refusing to rent to a tenant solely for the reason that they have Section 8 may be illegal.\\"DC Human Rights Act of 1977\\" Subchapter 2 Part C: Housing and Commercial Spaces the document states: 'It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice to do any of the following acts, wholly or partially for a discriminatory reason based on the actual or perceived...source of income.' Government assistance such as vouchers are considered a source of income. Landlords can use only general means of disqualifying a tenant (credit, criminal history, past evictions, etc.). It also may be illegal to post \\"No Section 8\\" advertisements. However, other landlords willingly accept Section 8 tenants, due to: * a large available pool of potential renters (the waiting list for new Section 8 tenants is usually very long, see below) * regular and generally prompt payments from the PHA for its share of the rent * tenants' incentive to take good care of the property (PHAs require that tenants not damage rental properties. In many instances a tenant may be removed from the program if they owe money to a previous landlord). Whether voucher- or project-based, all subsidized units must meet the HQS, thus ensuring that the family has a healthy and safe place to live. This improvement in the landlord's private property is an important byproduct of this program, both for the individual families and for the larger goal of community development. =Applicants= Applicants may apply for a Section 8 housing voucher at any county or city housing authority office in their state, and although rules vary according to each authority, in general, residents of a particular area who receive a voucher from the jurisdiction in which they live may use the voucher anywhere in the country, but nonresidents of the jurisdiction must live in the jurisdiction that issues the voucher to them for 12 months before they can move to a different area. Also, priority for vouchers is often reserved for those who reside in the service area of that housing authority. In many localities, the PHA waiting lists for Section 8 vouchers may be thousands of households long, waits of three to six years to obtain vouchers are common, and many lists are closed to new applicants. Wait lists are often briefly opened (often for just five days), which may occur as little as once every seven years. Some PHAs use a \\"lottery\\" approach, where there can be as many as 100,000 applicants for 10,000 spots on the waitlist, with spots being awarded on the basis of weighted or non-weighted lotteries, with priority sometimes given to local residents, the disabled, veterans, and the elderly.Other PHAs will award a spot on the wait list to all who apply as long as the wait list is open, with vouchers being awarded in the order applications are received. \\"Co Co County Housing Office Flooded with Section 8 Apps: Too many people need help with housing in East Bay county\\" , NBC Bay Area, Tuesday, Nov 4, 2008 There is no guarantee that anyone will ever receive a spot on the waiting list. =Family obligations= Families who participate in the program must abide by a series of rules and regulations, often referred to as \\"family obligations\\", in order to maintain their voucher, including accurately reporting to the PHA all changes in household income and family composition so the amount of their subsidy (and the applicable rental unit size limitation) can be updated accordingly. In recent years, the HUD Office of the Inspector General has spent more time and money on fraud detection and prevention.  Fair Market Rents  Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are calculated to determine how much a landlord is able to accept for rent of a unit to a Section 8 voucher recipient. FMRs are gross rental rates and dictate the maximum rental rate to be agreed upon in a lease document.https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/fmr- overview.pdf The calculation of FMRs is based on a standard quality rent from the five year American Community Survey, as well as a recent mover adjustment, which is the relationship between the standard quality for five years and the one year recent mover rents. FMRs also include a CPI adjustment and a trend factor adjustment. The trend factor adjustment is how HUD expects rental rates to grow. FMRs include all major utilities (heat, electricity, etc.), but does not include telephone, cable, satellite television, or internet service. Utilities are included in FMRs whether the obligation of payment is under the tenant or the landlord. FMRs can be found using HUD's Database. = Small Area Fair Market Rents = The Small Area Fair Market Rents Program (SAFMRP) was officially implemented by HUD in January 2017.https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/fmr2016f/SAFMR-Final-Rule.pdf This system is an update to the system HUD uses to calculate Fair Market Rents (FMRs) in metropolitan areas. The purpose is to examine metropolitan area FMRs by ZIP code, as opposed to in total. HUD stated that this program is aimed to allow voucher recipients to move into higher opportunity areas and reduce the concentration of voucher recipients in a given metropolitan area. While the program was originally intended to be mandatory for several metropolitan areas immediately, the requirement for the use of SAFRMs was delayed to October 1, 2019.https://www.huduser.gov/portal/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/SecretarysDetermination.pdf SAFMRs can now be found through the HUD database. The implementation of this program follows a demonstration project coordinated by HUD in 2010. The project included the following Public Housing Authorities (PHAs): The Housing Authority of the County of Cook (IL), the City of Long Beach (CA) Housing Authority, the Chattanooga (TN) Housing Authority, the Town of Mamaroneck (NY) Housing Authority, and the Housing Authority of Laredo (TX). An early report states that the effects of this program need to be analyzed over a long period of time before determining results. Vincent Reina, Arthur Acolin, and Raphael W. Bostic, published an early examination of the new SAFMRP in 2019. This study finds varied results in the SAFMRP based on different metropolitan areas. Two areas of note are the highest performing city in the study and the lowest, Dallas, TX, and Chattanooga, TN, respectively. The authors argue that Dallas performed well with the SAFMRP because the city was required by court order to implement the program, and the program has been in place for longer than all other cities in the study. The authors state that the benefits of the SAFMRP change over time, and analysis of the program must include time series analysis for all effects. The authors also explain why Chattanooga, TN may have performed the lowest in the study. Two reasons include the fact that most rental units were already in accessible areas, and most residential areas in Chattanooga are low opportunity, therefore voucher recipients did not have increased choice with the implementation of the program.  Earned Income Disallowance  There is a provision for disabled people who have a Section 8 subsidized dwelling to have their rent frozen for a specified time if they are working part-time below a certain income level. This is called the Earned Income Disallowance or Earned Income Disregard (EID) and is stipulated under US 24 CFR 5.617, \\"Self-sufficiency incentives for persons with disabilities‚ÄîDisallowance of increase in annual income\\". This was enacted as part of Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA) (Sec. 508(b); 42 U.S.C. 1437a(d)). This requires Public Housing Authorities and some owners, in calculating rent, to temporarily \\"disregard\\" increased income earned when certain public housing residents and disabled participants in certain housing assistance programs return/go to work or job-related programs. The idea is to foster self-sufficiency for those who are on subsidies and disability and other assistance.HUD, \\"Admission and Occupancy FAQ Frequently Asked Questions : Treatment of Income (24 CFR 5.609)\\" Jordan, Melanie, \\"Rent Freeze Basics for Public and Subsidized Housing Tenants Who Go to Work: A Guide for Mass.

Studies  Howard Husock, vice president for policy research at the conservative Manhattan Institute, heavily criticized Section 8 in a 2003 book on housing policy as a vehicle for exporting inner city social problems to the suburbs.Howard Husock, America's Trillion-Dollar Housing Mistake: The Failure of American Housing Policy (Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, 2003), 50-58. Hanna Rosin, an American journalist, has argued that Section 8 has led to crime being more evenly spread out across U.S. metropolitan areas, without any net decrease. This was the core thesis of her article published by The Atlantic in 2008, in which she linked Section 8 to a crime wave in the Memphis, Tennessee, metropolitan area.Rosin, Hanna, \\"American Murder Mystery\\" , The Atlantic, July/August 2008Hanna Rosin, \\"American Murder Mystery,\\" in The Best American Crime Reporting 2009, eds. Otto Penzler & Thomas H. Cook, 249-276 (New York: HarperCollins, 2009), 255-256. Rosin's article attempted to position Memphis as just one particularly troubling example of a nationwide trend: \\"Still, researchers around the country are seeing the same basic pattern: projects coming down in inner cities and crime pushing outward, in many cases destabilizing cities or their surrounding areas.\\" Rosin's article has been highly influential among politicians in cities claiming to be negatively affected by Section 8, such as Lancaster, California.Victoria Schlesinger, \\"Section 8 Tenants Unwelcome\\" , California Lawyer, July 2012. Rosin's article was later criticized by Greg AnrigGreg Anrig and Harold Pollack, \\"False Accusation,\\" The American Prospect, 30 July 2008. in an article published on The American Prospect. In the article, Anrig accuses Rosin of placing an excessive amount of blame on housing policy for the reported increase in crime. The article makes reference to the fact that Rosin never made a conclusive argument that those who participate in Section 8 were responsible for the higher rates of crime, as those who receive housing support are subject to screenings based on drug use and previous criminal activity. Rosin instead relies on a heat map of crime created by Richard Janikowski and Phyllis Betts who are reported to have said they were \\"[‚Ä¶] amazed ‚Äì and deflated ‚Äì to see how perfectly the two data sets fit together.\\" Janikowski and Betts later disavowed any connection between housing vouchers and increases in crime in the area in a later letter to the editor for the Atlantic. Rosin failed to mention that there was a consistent decrease and increase in crime from inner-cities to the inner-ring suburbs across most metropolitan areas due to shifting populations. Anrig argues that economic factors are more likely responsible for Memphis's increase in crime, as male unemployment almost doubled between the years of 1990 and 2000. Anrig also makes reference to Moving to Opportunity (MTO), a randomized policy experiment. The study concludes that there was no increase in violent crime for the participants of subsidized housing or their surrounding neighborhoods in the five cities tested; Memphis was not a part of the study. Even though the participants were far more likely to stay in poorer areas when given the chance to leave, families still received a modest academic and psychological benefit. In fact, according to a paper prepared for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Office of Policy Development and ResearchIngrid, Gould, Lens, Michael, O'Regan, Katherine \\" Memphis Murder Mystery Revisited: Do Housing Voucher Households Cause Crime? \\" , Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, March 2012 rather than increasing crime, those who use housing vouchers are more likely to move into areas where crime is increasing. = Housing Specialists = Matthew Marr published a study of the Los Angeles housing market in Summer of 2001 that examines the effects of housing placement specialists on the Section 8 voucher program. Marr finds that housing placement specialists function as an intermediary between tenants and landlords that help increase mobility of Section 8 voucher recipients. Tight rental markets can pose a challenge to Section 8 voucher recipients. Marr finds, through observations and interviews, that the resource of housing placement specialists can help prevent private landlord apprehension, and help voucher recipients navigate the program and general rental market. Landlord apprehension can be a result of many factors. Common qualitative data indicates some factors to be: tenant behavior, tenant cleanliness, and financial burden. These factors are some areas housing specialists work to mitigate problems. See also * Discrimination in awarding Section 8 housing * Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations * Hills v.

It was established by the Education Act 1989. NZQA administers the National Certificates of Educational Achievement (NCEA) and the New Zealand Scholarship for secondary school students. It is also responsible for the quality assurance of non-university, tertiary training providers, the New Zealand Register of Quality Assured Qualifications, and the New Zealand Qualifications Framework (National Qualifications Framework). It has further roles in evaluating overseas qualifications. In July 1990 it took over the work of the former Universities Entrance Board, the Ministry of Education's examinations, the Trades Certification Board and the Authority for Advanced Vocational Awards. NZQA is funded from the central government as well as fees, with the budget being about $70 million each year. Governance The Chief Executive, Grant Klinkum, and Board Chair, Murray Strong, were both appointed in 2014 and remain in place as of 2020. Poutasi had previously been the Director General of Health and worked in senior management roles across the health sector. Suckling is a governance specialist and heads a Board appointed by the Minister of Education that represents industry, communication, and education interests. MƒÅori strategy NZQA's MƒÅori strategy, Te Rautaki MƒÅori 2012‚Äì2017, guides NZQA towards fulfilling its contribution to the government's education sector goal of MƒÅori enjoying and achieving education success as MƒÅori. The strategy was launched in June 2012 with the two main goals of Accelerated MƒÅori learner success and advanced use of mƒÅtauranga MƒÅori. NZQA has also produced two publications that support these goals ‚Äì Enhancing MƒÅtauranga MƒÅori and Global Indigenous Knowledge (launched April 2014) and the earlier Conversations on MƒÅtauranga MƒÅori (launched July 2012). Review A Targeted Review of Qualifications at levels 1‚Äì6 on New Zealand's ten-level qualifications framework commenced in 2008. The review aimed to ensure that New Zealand qualifications are useful and relevant to current and future learners, employers and other stakeholders. NZQA administers the New Zealand Qualifications Framework (NZQF) which was established in July 2010 as a result of the Targeted Review and is a comprehensive, up-to-date list of all non-university quality assured qualifications in New Zealand. Tertiary organisations are required to comply with statutory policies like the periodic external evaluation and review (EER) policy that provides an independent judgement of the educational performance and capability in self-assessment of all non-university tertiary education organisations. In 2011 NZQA introduced a new set of incentives and sanctions for providers, based on EER results, to bring higher performance to the sector. In May 2014 NZQA introduced ‚ÄòInnovation at NZQA‚Äô to its website detailing the organisation's strategic thinking and ‚ÄòFuture State‚Äô programme of work around responding to a global and digital environment and trialling new processes and technologies. Numbers In 2013 more than 143,000 candidates took part in the annual NCEA and New Zealand Scholarship examinations administered by NZQA and achievement results were analysed in the Annual Report on NCEA and New Zealand Scholarship Data & Statistics released each year by NZQA. In 2016 more than 146,000 candidates sat NCEA and Scholarship exams. Because of the Kaikoura earthquake, the Scholarship exams were postponed. Students in the Hurunui and Kaikoura districts were unable to attend their exams as their schools were closed, meaning they had to use their derived grades. Controversies In 2005 the Authority's Chairman and CEO resigned after an investigation by the State Services Commission into the 2004 New Zealand Scholarship exams. In the physics exams only 39 out of 1,012 students who sat the exam received a scholarship while in English the result was 228 out of 587. This, and the state of the Authority as a whole at that time, was described by media as a \\"debacle\\". Concerns over exams In 2016, mistakes were made in the 2016 maths exam at every level. In 2017, many students and teachers were left perplexed by NCEA Level 1 MCAT externals, stating that they were \\"too difficult\\" and \\"not in the correct standard\\".

Prior to the 1930s, there was no town. The bay had been used as a port intermittently to ship coffee, but there was no permanent settlement due to the lack of potable water. The name \\"Puerto Escondido\\" had roots in the legend of a woman who escaped her captors and hid here. The Nahuatl word for this area was Zicatela, meaning ‚Äúplace of large thorns\\". Today, it refers to the area's most famous beach. Puerto Escondido is one of the most important tourist attractions on the Oaxacan coast. It caters to a more downscale and eclectic clientele than neighboring Huatulco, mostly surfers, backpackers and Mexican families. The main attractions are the beaches: Zicatela Beach hosts major surfing competitions, while other beaches have gentle waves. A large lagoon area to the west of the town is popular for fishing and birdwatching. History The area around Puerto Escondido had been inhabited by indigenous peoples for centuries, but no towns of any size were established during the pre-Hispanic or colonial eras. The bay was known as Bahia de la Escondida (Bay of the Hidden Woman) due to a legend associated with this place. The story states that a fierce pirate, Andr√©s Drake, brother of Sir Francis Drake, anchored his ship in the bay when the area was completely uninhabited, to rest for a few days unmolested by authorities. Some weeks before, he and his crew kidnapped a young Mixtec woman from the village of Santa Mar√≠a Huatulco and took her prisoner. While in the bay, the woman escaped the cabin in which she was being held, and being a good swimmer, jumped overboard to get to shore and hide in the jungle just beyond the beach. Since then, the pirates referred to the woman as ‚ÄúLa Escondida‚Äù (the hidden one) and every time the ship returned to these waters, the captain ordered his crew to search the area around the bay, however, they never found her. Hence, the area became known as the Bah√≠a de la Escondida. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was known as Punta Escondida (Hidden Point), then later, Puerto Escondido. At that time, it was just a small fishing village that intermittently was used to ship coffee. Back then, Puerto Escondido suffered from a lack of potable water, although the Colotepec River ran nearby. This caused people to settle in other places. Some did stay, including Nazario Castellanos and Escol√°stica Valencia, who were the night watchmen for the nearby coffee plantations and considered to be the town's first residents. There was no real town until the 1930s, when Puerto Escondido's activity as a port was more firmly established. Puerto Escondido belonged to the municipality of Santa Mar√≠a Colotepec. However, eventually the residents petitioned to change jurisdiction to another nearby municipality, San Pedro Mixtepec, which was granted in the 1940s. From the 1940s to the 1960s, a church was constructed and the first school was built. Wells were dug to alleviate the water supply problems, and generators bought to supply electricity to the pumps and the few streetlights. However, there were still problems getting needed outside supplies such as sugar. These commodities only arrived when a merchant ship entered the bay to sell its wares. Sometimes, this would not happen for months. Residents got by with local products such as fish, poultry, iguanas, chicken and turtle eggs. After the Sola de Vega road to the capital of Oaxaca was constructed, this problem was alleviated somewhat. In the 1960s, Highway 200 was built, connecting Oaxacan coastal towns with Acapulco. Surfers and other tourists began to find the quiet beaches around Puerto Escondido and tourism began to flourish. Its function as a port diminished as coffee began to be shipped by truck. Other infrastructure added included those to supply the area with potable water, a small airport where the Rinconada is now, mail service and some government offices. However, in the 1970s only about 400 people lived in Puerto Escondido. With time, Puerto Escondido's importance as a tourist attraction increased, with hotels and resorts being constructed. For many years, restaurants were almost exclusively in ‚Äúpalapas‚Äù (thatched roof shelters) with fishermen preparing their catches; however, these have mostly given way to modern tourist facilities. Puerto Escondido is one of the most important tourist sites on the Oaxacan coast. The community of Puerto Escondido is divided between two municipalities. The Zicatela Beach side belongs to the municipality of Santa Mar√≠a Colotepec and the western portion belongs to San Pedro Mixtepec. The boundary between the two municipalities is in dispute, leaving many businesses in limbo, sometimes paying taxes to both municipalities. . Puerto Escondido is lobbying for a more independent status with the Congress of the state of Oaxaca, against opposition from San Pedro Mixtepec. 69% of the municipality's population lives in Puerto Escondido. In addition to the above problems, backers of the measure stated that while the community generates most of the municipality's income, it does not receive support from the municipal seat. In August 2008, residents of Puerto Escondido blocked the highway to the municipal seat of San Pedro Mixtepec to protest the lack of money for infrastructure in the town. As of the 2009 census, Puerto Escondido had a population of 20,178 On 30 July 2009, the state congress declared Puerto Escondido to be a city. However, the declaration did not resolve the boundary dispute between San Pedro Mixtepec and Santa Mar√≠a Colotepec. The City A view of the city The morning routine on Playa Principal Puerto Escondido is mostly located in the municipality of San Pedro Mixtepec in the western portion of Oaxaca's coast also known as the Emerald Coast. Its bay is adjoined by a number of rocky cliffs, which vary in height between 15 and 30 metres. The town center is located on the north side of the bay. The climate is tropical and humid, with an average annual temperature of 28 ¬∞C (82 ¬∞F) with a rainy season in the summer. Puerto Escondido is the oldest tourist attraction in the region, and is the main centre of tourist activity, both for nationals and foreigners. The large waves of Zicatela Beach put it into the top ten surfing destinations. The port does continue to support commercial fishing activity, and it also attracts people for deep-sea fishing (esp. for sailfish). Puerto Escondido is not as well-known or visited as other beach resort areas such as Acapulco or Cancun because there are only domestic flights, discouraging a number of visitors. Bus rides from the Oaxacan capital take seven hours over hairpin turns as the roads descend the Sierra del Sur mountain range. Most of the bus terminal coming from Oaxaca are located in the downtown. Puerto Escondido is mostly downscale and rustic, with many small and mid-sized hotels and restaurants, but there are a few upscale hotels. Most cuisine is based on seafood and local plants, which include eleven species of banana, chocolate and coffee. It also has some Italian restaurants, which were opened by recent Italian immigrants. The tourist center of Puerto Escondido is not a plaza but P√©rez Gazga Avenue, known locally as \\"El Adoquin\\" or \\"La Zona Adoquinada\\" (the paving stone street). Beginning with a statue of Benito Ju√°rez are found bars, hotels, cafes, restaurants, nightclubs, craft shops, Internet cafes, corner stores, tour operators and scuba diving rental. It also serves as a promenade as it parallels the main beach of the town, and is pedestrian-only after 17:00. At night it is crowded with locals and tourists. This is one of the areas to buy Mexican, especially Oaxacan, handcrafts such as loose-fitting blouses, shirts, vests, wraps, tapestries, handbags, bags, jackets, hammocks, carved stone jewelry, silver and seashell items. However, the main market in the town centre is where you get competitive Mexican prices. Away from the beach above the Adoquin is the Coastal Highway 200. The Andador Esc√©nico (Scenic Walkway) is a set of paths, stairs and bridges that begin at the main beach of the town and winds its way over rocky oceanside cliffs, passing below the lighthouse to a lookout the named Sue√±o Posible (Possible Dream). In some places the walkway is very near the ocean and gets wet from the waves. Each year, the city celebrates Carnival which begins with the \\"quema de mal humor\\" or the burning of bad mood. This is done with an effigy with the purpose of ridding the people of bad thoughts and moods in order to enjoy the festivities. Education The Universidad del Mar has one of its campuses here. Beaches The main attractions of Puerto Escondido are its beaches, which have become internationally known. The area also is attractive to scuba divers because of the variety of fish, large oysters, lobsters and manta rays. Although the Pacific Coast of Mexico generally runs north‚Äìsouth, this section of the coast in Oaxaca runs east‚Äìwest, Playa Zicatela is on the eastern end. Puerto Escondido became famous for surfing competitions held at Zicatela Beach every year in November. The competition brings competitors from various countries. Nicknamed the \\"Mexican Pipeline\\" due to the similar power and shape of the Banzai Pipeline on the North Shore of Oahu, the wave that breaks on Zicatela Beach draws an international crowd of surfers, bodyboarders and their entourages. Mid to late summer is low season for tourists, but a prime time for waves and international tournaments. A number of international competitions such as the ESPN X Games, and the MexPipe Challenge have taken place. This beach is separated from the other beaches by a rocky outcropping called \\"El Morro\\" (the nose). The beach is 50 to 100 metres wide and four kilometres long with large waves that reach up to sixteen metres high. Lifeguards are stationed at this high-risk beach as well as on the other beaches. About half of these are professional and the other half volunteers. Zicatela is still a surfers' beach, with the strong rip current making the area unsuitable for swimming. The Zicatela Beach tourist district caters to surfers, including specials on surfboard rentals. The beach now has a promenade, landscaped with flowers and shrubs along the restaurants, many recently established. West of Zicatela over the El Moro rocky outcrop is Playa Marinero, which is the best beach for swimming as the surf and rip currents are much less. There is some surf, but gentle enough for beginning surfers and bodyboarding. West from Playa Marinero is Playa Principal, or main beach, fronting the town proper. This beach has boats and water taxis are anchored close to shore. Here, fishermen arrive at dawn to sell their catch to local restaurants and families. It is 500 metres long with fine, gray sand and low to moderate surf. This is the primary place to hire boats which take tourists to otherwise inaccessible beaches, to see porpoises and marine turtles or for deep-sea fishing. This beach is also popular with Mexican families to picnic on and play soccer. Puerto Angelito Beach West of the Playa Principal is the lighthouse with a stone walkway, Andador Esc√©nico, below it. From the end of the walkway, and a bit farther west, are the twin beaches of Puerto Angelito and Manzanillo, between which is a small rock outcropping. These are on a sheltered cove, making it safe for swimming, with Manzanillo having slightly more surf. Angelito Beach has small, family-owned restaurants located in palapas (open-air thatched structures). These beaches have water that varies in color from emerald green to turquoise blue. Puerto Angelito tends to be crowded and frequented by busloads of visitors. Playa Manzanillo is quieter as there is no road access. Playa Carrizalillo West from these beaches is Playa Carrizalillo which has white sand and cobalt blue water edged in light green. This beach is on a small bay. There are no vehicular roads to this beach, and the footpath descends a steep slope on a recently installed rock stairway. It takes about fifteen minutes to walk to here from the town. A water taxi ride from Playa Principal is another option for accessing Carrizalillo. Waves are normally gentle, except for a zone that opens directly onto the ocean where waves are big enough for surfing. The difficult access means that the beach is not as crowded with walking vendors as the Puerto Angelito Beach. There are few restaurants and the area is generally cleaner. On the east and west sides of the bay are rocky outcroppings that serve as habitat for a wide variety of fish and coral, making it popular for snorkeling. Near Carrizalillo is the Rinconada, a former landing strip that is now lined with restaurants, salons, and shops. It also contains a lending library run by a local charity run by expatriates. The westernmost beach is Playa Bacocho with upscale beach clubs. It has fine, soft sand, palm trees, warm, blue-green water and a moderate surf although the far west part of the beach can have a strong rip current. It faces southwest, offering good sunset views. West from Bacocho are still undeveloped beaches. Transportation Puerto Escondido International Airport has flights to the city of Oaxaca, Monterrey and Mexico City. Commercial busses from the city of Oaxaca take about seven hours. The new 3-lane superhighway (supercarretera) from Oaxaca is coming to Ventanillas, Oaxaca, about 13 km east of Puerto Escondido, where it meets the old coastal Highway 200. Current completion date is sometime in 2018. vivapuerto.com] This will cut the travel time from Oaxaca by more than half. Media There are an AM and FM radio station and Spanish language weekly newspapers. ¬°Viva Puerto! http://vivapuerto.com is the local, bilingual magazine. Fiestas de Noviembre The Fiestas de Noviembre (Festivals of November) are held during the month into the beginning of December. Events are scheduled in the San Pedro Mixtepec and Santa Mar√≠a Colotepec jurisdictions and there is little coordination between the events. This usually means a large number of events, more than a few concurrent and competing for attendees. Zicatela events are often staged on Playa Zicatela while the uptown events are often on Playa Principal or the municipal plaza west and above the main beach. Some of the major events include a motocross event, a sailfishing competition, a festival of coastal dance and a surfing tournament. Laguna de Manialtepec About 10 km west from Puerto Escondido is the Laguna de Manialtepec. There is a small village on the way called Bajos de Chila. as well as a small archeological zone of the Chatino culture. This site has a Sun Stone which represented the solar deity and a statue of a high-ranking priest. The lagoon is full of mangroves and many birds such as pelicans, seagulls, ibis, storks, cranes, jacanas, buzzards, kingfishers, swans and other species. Other wildlife here includes raccoons, weasels, deer, wild boar, foxes and crocodiles. A number of these are in danger due to poaching. In the middle of the lagoon is an island named Isla del Gallo, on which according to legend, a rooster can be heard singing every year on December 24.

Go-karts come in all shapes and forms, from motorless models to high-powered racing machines. Some, such as Superkarts, are able to beat racing cars or motorcycles on long circuits. Etymology The exact origin of the term is unclear (as all carts \\"go\\"). One of the first appearances of the term is an 1885 painting by the Scottish artist Hugh Cameron RSA: \\"The Go- Cart\\".https://artuk.org/discover/artists/cameron-hugh-18351918 It is also unclear why the \\"C\\" was later changed to a \\"K\\". Unmotorised Gravity racers, in North America usually referred to as Soap Box Derby carts, are the simplest type of go-karts. They are propelled by gravity. Go karts without motors are also propelled by pedal power. Motorised Many recreational karts can be powered by four-stroke engines or electric motors, while racing karts use a two-stroke or, more rarely, higher powered four-stroke engines. Most of them are single seater but some recreational models can accommodate a passenger. In some countries, go-karts can be licensed for use on public roads often referred to as street tracks. Typically there are some restrictions; in the European Union, a go-kart modified for use on the road must be outfitted with headlights (high/low beam), tail lights, a horn, indicators, and an engine not exceeding .  Recreational, concession and indoor karts  Besides traditional kart racing, many commercial enterprises offer karts for rent, often called \\"recreational\\" or \\"concession\\" karts. The tracks can be indoor or outdoor. Karts are rented by sessions (usually from 10 to 30 minutes) or on a day basis . They use sturdy chassis complete with dedicated bodywork, providing driver safety. Most of these enterprises use an \\"Arrive and Drive\\" format which provides customers with all the safety gear (helmets, gloves and driver outfits) necessary, and allow them to show up anytime to race at a reasonable price, without the problem of having to own their own equipment and gear. Outdoor tracks can offer low-speed karts strictly for amusement (dedicated chassis equipped with low powered four-stroke engines or electric motors), or faster, more powerful karts, similar to a racing kart, powered by four-stroke engines up to and, more rarely, by 2-stroke engines, but designed to be more robust for rental use. Typically, outdoor tracks are also be used for traditional kart races. Indoor kart tracks can be found in many large cities in different parts of the world. These tracks are often located in refurbished factories or warehouses, and are typically shorter than traditional outdoor tracks. Indoor karts are usually powered by a four-stroke gasoline engine producing anywhere from , or sometimes by an electric motor. Many tracks offer competitive races and leagues. At the top level, an Indoor Karting World Championship (IKWC) exists. = Engines = Power is transmitted from the engine to the rear axle by way of a chain (some rentals use a belt). * Four-stroke engines can be standard air-cooled industrial based engines, sometimes with small modifications, developing from about . Briggs & Stratton, Tecumseh (company closed in 2008), Kohler, Robin, and Honda are manufacturers of such engines. They are adequate for racing and fun kart applications. There are also more powerful two-stroke engines available from manufacturers like Yamaha, KTM, Biland, or Aixro (Wankel engine) offering from . They run at up to 11,000 rpm, and are manufactured specifically for karting. PRD makes the PRD Fireball, a two-stroke engine delivering at 15,580 rpm. * Electric go- karts are low maintenance, requiring only that the lead-acid or lithium- polymer batteries of the karts be plugged into an array of chargers after each run. Since they are pollution-free and emit no smoke, the racetracks can be indoors in controlled environments. Electric karts powered by lead-acid batteries can run a maximum of 20-30 minutes before performance is affected, while those powered by lithium batteries may last up to 2 hours on a single charge. Some karts have been fitted with hydrogen fuel cells.Forze hydrogen karts = External controls = Go-karts used in amusement parks can be fitted with additional electronic controls, such as remote speed limiters, to help promote a safer operating environment. In the event of an accident or an out of control racer, the track attendant can remotely slow or stop all vehicles on the track via radio control. This remote speed control can also be used to limit young riders to a slow operating speed, while a race consisting only of adults is permitted a higher speed. These controls can be applied to both electric and combustion-engine karts.

Tinker was credited officially with shooting down eight enemy aircraft and was the highest-scoring American air ace of the war. However, Tinker's logbook suggests that he claimed 19 victories, which would make him the sixth-highest scoring pilot in FARE. That relatively few of his claims were officially recognized was due to the complex system of verifying air kills used by FARE and the financial incentive paid to mercenaries: many victories were not verifiable because the downed aircraft crashed in an enemy-held area and/or an incentive would not have to be paid.Andr√©s Garc√≠a La Calle, Mitos y verdades: La aviaci√≥n de caza en la guerra civil espa√±ola.; M√©xico: Lito Offset fersa, 1973. In addition, Tinker and other pilots from Escuadrilla La Calle (\\"La Calle's Squadron\\"), also known as 1¬™ Escuadrilla de Chatos (1st Chato Squadron\\"), shared a number of joint kills against Junkers Ju 52 bombers. He reported narrowly avoiding death at both the hands of enemy aviators and malfunctioning equipment. He left a detailed record of his experiences as a fighter pilot for the Republicans in his memoir Some Still Live, published by Funk & Wagnalls Co in New York, 1938 and recently republished by The Clapton Press, London. Early years Frank \\"Salty\\" Tinker was born in Kaplan, Louisiana, and grew up in DeWitt, Arkansas. In 1926, he joined the US Navy hoping to become a naval aviator. In 1933, he graduated from the US Naval Academy. In 1934, he was assigned to US Navy aviation and became a pilot of a reconnaissance floatplane of the USS San Francisco cruiser. Because of problems with alcohol and brawls, he was dismissed from the Navy. Later in 1935, Tinker joined the crew of a Standard Oil tanker running from New York to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as a third mate. By July 1936, he left his job with Standard Oil, and looked for a job as a pilot. The I-15 Polikarpov No. 56 flown by F.G. Tinker in the 1st Sq Lacalle. He scored four victories in this aircraft. Occasionally he flew No. 58 as well. The I-16 Polikarpov No. CM-023 flown by F.G. Tinker in the 1st Sq Moscas with which he shot down two German Bf 109Bs. Spanish Civil War After the start of the Spanish Civil War, Tinker offered his service to a Republican side, reportedly because of his aversion to fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, who was helping the Spanish Nationalists. He negotiated a high salary of $1,500 monthly, and a premium of $1,000 for any aircraft he shot down. Under nom de guerre Francisco G√≥mez Trejo, he went to Spain via France. For a short time, from January 6, 1937, Tinker served in a light bomber squadron, flying obsolete Breguet 19 bombers. From January 23, he, along with some other American pilots, was assigned to a fighter unit, 1st Escuadrilla de Chatos commanded by Andr√©s Garc√≠a La Calle, flying Soviet Polikarpov I-15 \\"Chato\\" biplanes. In 1937, he flew many combat missions against the Fascist Falange air forces, generally duelling Germans and Italians. The squadron first entered action on February 10, and took part in a Battle of Guadalajara. On March 14, Tinker shot down his first aircraft, an Italian Fiat CR.32 fighter, followed by another CR.32 on March 20. On April 17, he shot down a German Heinkel He 51 fighter from Legion Condor over Teruel. On May 3, 1937, Tinker was assigned to 1st Escuadrilla de Moscas, commanded by the Russian, Ivan Lakyeyev, flying the faster Polikarpov I-16 \\"Mosca\\" monoplane fighters. On June 2 and June 16, he shot down another CR.32. On July 13, he became the first pilot to shoot down one of the most modern German fighters, a Messerschmitt Bf 109A, near Madrid. It was piloted by Unteroffizier Guido Honess of 2. Staffel/Jagdgruppe 88 (2./J 88), flying a Bf 109A believed to be marked 6-4. Honess, who was killed in the ensuing crash, was the first German pilot to achieve three victories with this new type of aircraft. On July 17, Tinker shot down another Bf 109A. This first version of the Bf 109 was not a \\"good climber\\" and Tinker caught it from behind while the German pilot tried to gain altitude after a dive on him ‚Äì a lethal mistake according to Tinker. The scene is described in detail in his book Some Still Live. His final victory was over a Fiat CR.32 on July 18, 1937. Tinker flew his last missions on July 29, 1937, then returned to the U.S. While in Spain, Tinker socialized with Ernest Hemingway, Robert Hale Merriman, the leader of the American Volunteers of the Lincoln Brigade and his successor Milton Wolff, who led the 15th International Brigade during the Battle of the Ebro. Later years and death Eventually, Tinker fell victim to combat stress reaction due to the constant combat. After the war, Tinker was a guest speaker in New York on the radio program \\"We the People\\", discussing his feats in the Spanish Civil War. He wrote a number of articles including a series for the Arkansas Gazette Magazine describing his voyage from St. Charles (Arkansas County) down the White and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans with his fox terrier. Tinker also wrote a series of serial articles for The Saturday Evening Post titled \\"Some Still Live\\". These articles detailing his war experiences, were published in book form with the same name in 1938. Ernest Hemingway was notably a fan, lauding it to Maxwell Perkins. Hemingway's influence on the style is rather evident. However, soon after the book was published, Tinker died, a purported suicide by a gunshot to his head in a Little Rock hotel. The reasons for his death are still controversial and may relate to the harsh treatment he received from the FBI, due to his support of the Spanish Republican cause. Tinker asked to return to the U.S. Navy or U.S. Army as a pilot but he was rejected. He even threatened to return to Spain to continue fighting. At the end, he was haunted by the thought he had betrayed his comrades and himself. His colleague Albert John Baumler, nicknamed \\"Ajax\\" (from his name acronym A.J.), proposed joining the American and other foreign pilots then flying for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. His signed request was found next to his death bed with an empty bottle of whiskey. On his tombstone, the local priest engraved the phrase in Spanish: ¬øQui√©n Sabe?, meaning \\"Who knows?\\" Arkansas Aviation Historical Society inducted Tinker into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 1999. On July 11, 2009, near the centennial of his birth, relatives, admirers and the Grand Prairie Historical Society participated in an observance and toast at Tinker's gravesite in DeWitt, Arkansas.\\"DeWitt's Hometown Aviation Hero\\" brochure.

It lies south of the suburb of Petone and the mouth of the Hutt River, and about northwest of the much smaller Makaro/Ward Island.  Names  Matiu/Somes Island as seen from Normandale Legend has it that both Matiu and Makaro Islands received their original MƒÅori names from Kupe, the semi-legendary first navigator to reach New Zealand and get home again with reports of the new land. He named them after his two daughters (or, in some versions of the tale, nieces) when he first entered the harbour about 1000 years ago. After European settlement, the island was known for over a century as Somes Island. In 1839 it fell under the control of the New Zealand Company along with much of the greater Wellington region. The island was renamed after Joseph Somes, the company's deputy-governor and financier at the time. In 1997 however, the New Zealand Geographic Board assigned the official bilingual name of Matiu/Somes in recognition of the island's colourful European and MƒÅori histories.  History  = MƒÅori history = Matiu/Somes Island has had an extensive MƒÅori history and a varied, and a sometimes colourful and tragic, European one. Prior to the mid 17th century there were 2 MƒÅori Pa on the island, however, like the Ngati Ira Pa on Ward Island, they were not permanently inhabited, being \\"Pa of refuge\\" where the tribespeople could retreat to in times of war. One was in the centre of the island and little more than the remains of some middens are left there, however there was another Pa on the northern tip of the island, strategically positioned with cliffs on three sides for ease of defence. = European history = NZ Department of Conservation buildings Lighthouse with Wellington City in the background A lighthouse was built at the island's southwestern end in 1866, the first harbour light in New Zealand. The lighthouse that stands in place of the original today was constructed in 1900 and later automated. At various times throughout the 20th century it hosted enemy alien internees during wartime, and quarantine facilities for both human immigrants and (up to 1995) animals. Its use as a quarantine facility began with the arrival of the England in 1872, carrying several passengers with smallpox. Passengers and crew were quartered in makeshift accommodation. On other occasions, new arrivals would spend ten minutes in a smokehouse of chlorine, potassium nitrate and sulphur fumes for de-lousing. In 1942, the island was fortified with heavy anti-aircraft gun emplacements on the summit, but these were never used during the course of the war. This whole area was levelled flat for the purpose of this construction, with the result that was removed from the island's previous overall height. A degaussing station was built to provide protection for ships against magnetic mines. Many of the physical features of these sites are present on the island today. Matiu/Somes became part of Lower Hutt in 1989 and came under the full control of the Department of Conservation (\\"DOC\\") as a scientific and historic reserve in August 1995. Ferry services from Matiu to the Wellington CBD and Days Bay 7 days a week and to Seatoun during weekends operate as part of ferries in Wellington.https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to- go/wellington-kapiti/places/matiu-somes-island/  Island geography and ecology  Shag rocks at southern end of Matiu-Somes Island A distinct gully runs from the south of the quarantine station and terminates at the sea on the southern end of the island between two (now) largely forested ridges on either side to the east and west. Generally, this gully is a swampy area but it also represents an ephemeral watercourse and during and following periods of heavy rain a small creek flows down it. The island is a stronghold for the little blue penguin, several species of shag, the spotted skink, the silver gull and several rare and endangered species of plants. The Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand has been revegetating the island since 1984 and successfully eradicated rats and mice over a period between 1988 and 1989. Eleven male red-crowned kƒÅkƒÅriki (parakeets) were first introduced to the island in 2004 and immediately began breeding with a further eleven released in 2005. There are more than 500 species of invertebrates on the island including a couple of species of wƒìtƒÅ - Wellington tree wƒìtƒÅ and Cook Strait giant wƒìtƒÅ have been successfully transferred from Mana Island. A number of endangered plants species have found a refuge in the island. The island is now home to 6 species of native reptiles - common skink (Oligosoma nigriplantare), spotted skink (Oligosoma lineoocellatum), copper skink (Cyclodina aenea) and the common gecko (Hoplodactylus maculatus). Brothers Island tuatara were released in 1998. Forest geckos (Hoplodactylus granulatus) were transferred to the island in 2006. North Island robins sourced from Kapiti Island were released in April 2006; they bred for the first time in late September and this is viewed as encouraging by DOC staff as it appears to indicate that the island ecosystem represents a suitable habitat for this species. A solar- powered speaker system to attract fluttering shearwaters was installed and began transmitting later that year. Many of these projects have been supported by the community and the local iwi, Te Ati Awa. The Matiu/Somes Island Charitable Trust was established in 1998 as a partnership between Te Ati Awa and the general community to help protect, nurture and enhance the island by raising funds for projects that increased biodiversity and enhance visitors' enjoyment of the island. Through its active arm, \\"The Friends of Matiu/Somes\\", it encourages community participation in work on the island. It also works closely with DOC and community groups such as Forest and Bird.  Tourism  Matiu/Somes Island is an increasingly popular tourist attraction and educational resource for local schools, with about 15,000 visitors per year. The island is free of introduced mammalian predators (such as stoats). Visitors to the island must make sure they are pest-free. Before arriving they must check, clean and seal all gear to make sure no pests, soil, or seeds are brought to the island. Just to the north lies a much smaller island, Mokopuna Island. To protect endemic wildlife present ‚Äì particularly nesting seabirds ‚Äì landing by members of the public is prohibited here.

It opened on 493 screens, grossing $1,588,013 and ranking #10 on its opening weekend. It eventually earned $5,078,660 in the US. Critical reception Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes currently scores Celebrity with a 40% 'Rotten' rating from 42 reviews; consensus adding \\"Entertaining, but too scattered.\\" The film also holds a 41 on Metacritic. Janet Maslin of The New York Times observed, \\"Lee Simon is one of the filmmaker's wearier creations, in ways that deny Celebrity the bracing audacity of recent, better Allen films like Deconstructing Harry and Everyone Says I Love You. And even with Branagh as his younger alter ego, Allen finds no way to revitalize the character's predictable worries about advancing his career and chasing beautiful women ... Though Celebrity is filled with beautiful and famous faces, it has plenty of opportunity to bog down between star turns, and some of the episodes about the Simons are astonishingly flat.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said the film \\"plays oddly like the loose ends and unused inspirations of other Woody Allen movies; it's sort of a revue format in which a lot of famous people appear onscreen, perform in the sketch Woody devises for them and disappear. Some of the moments are very funny. More are only smile material, and a few don't work at all. Like all of Allen's films, it's smart and quirky enough that we're not bored, but we're not much delighted, either ... Branagh has all the Allen vocal mannerisms and the body language of comic uncertainty. He does Allen so carefully, indeed, that you wonder why Allen didn't just play the character himself.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt the film \\"suffers from lulls and lapses and one lulu of a casting gaffe, but this keenly observant spoof of the fame game is hardly the work of a burnout. At sixty-two, the Woodman can still mine caustic laughter from the darkest corners of his psyche. In Celebrity, he cracks his ringmaster's whip on a circus of rude, cathartic fun ... Branagh, whether by his choice or his director's, plays Lee like a Woody impressionist, down to the nervous gestures and the stuttering whine ... Lee should emerge as flawed but real in a world of gorgeous poseurs. Instead, Branagh's party-trick performance keeps audiences at a distance. What saves the day is the steady march of scintillating cameos from actors who bring out the best in Allen's barbed dialogue.\\" Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle stated, \\"Branagh stammers, bobs his head and runs the gamut of other established Woody tics and mannerisms - delivering nervous shtick where a performance would have sufficed. His novelty act belongs in the same bin with his hammy histrionics in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein ... The irony of Celebrity is that so much of it is admirably acted, written and directed. Despite his one-note obsessions, Allen is a fine director whose stories clip along, whose dialogue sparkles and whose actors look grateful for the luxury of his words.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film \\"a once-over-lightly rehash of mostly stale Allen themes and motifs\\" and added, \\"The spectacle of Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis doing over-the-top Woody Allen impersonations creates a neurotic energy meltdown ... Branagh is simply embarrassing as he flails, stammers and gesticulates in a manner that suggests a direct imitation of Allen himself ... For her part, Davis was brilliant in Husbands and Wives and has appeared effectively in other Allen films, but she not only overdoes the neurotic posturing this time but is essentially miscast ... Annoyingly mannered in performance as well as tiresomely familiar in the way it trots out its angst- ridden urban characters' problems, [the picture] has a hastily conceived, patchwork feel that is occasionally leavened by some lively supporting turns and the presence of so many attractive people onscreen.\\" Neil Norman of London Evening Standard noted that \\"many scenes, and indeed personalities, lack the credence of similar shots in Annie Hall, Manhattan or even Stardust Memories. Judy Davis's doorstepping television interviews in the Jean-Georges restaurant where she encounters several well-heeled New Yorkers, including Donald Trump (who is planning to buy St Patrick's Cathedral and knock it down) are frankly risible; a rehearsal scene in the Ziegfeld Theatre where [Winona Ryder]is being coached in the art of seducing a woman (gasp!) smacks of old-fashioned prurience. Fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi's turn as a lionised New York artist complaining at his opening at the Serge Sorokko Gallery in SoHo that fame will ruin him, is simply banal. Even the opening shot, of a film crew on the streets attempting to catch a reaction shot of Melanie Griffith' walking from a limo, is peopled with a veteran film-maker's notion of what young hip film- makers are like (shavenheaded, natch) rather than an identifiable reality.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded the film B- and called it a \\"big, muddled, contemporary variation on La Dolce Vita. She added, \\"[I]n every minute of DiCaprio's participation ... he juices Celebrity with a power surge that subsides as soon as he exits.\\" References External links  * Category:1998 films Category:1998 comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American satirical films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Woody Allen Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films about writers Category:Films with screenplays by Woody Allen Category:Films produced by Letty Aronson Category:Films produced by Jean Doumanian Category:1990s satirical films pt:Celebridades ","title":"Celebrity (film)"},{"id":"891830","text":"Corydon McAlmont Wassell (July 4, 1884 ‚Äì May 12, 1958) was a doctor best known for his work as a United States Navy physician.

Founded in 1997 to operate a three-mile spur through Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, the Ballard Terminal Railroad has expanded to operate two additional lines in the Puget Sound area, including Eastside Freight Railroad from Snohomish to Woodinville, Washington, and Meeker Southern Railroad , a segment from East Puyallup (\\"Meeker\\") to McMillin, Washington. Foundation Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway stopped offering service on a three-mile spur through Seattle's Ballard neighborhood in January 1997 because only three companies were buying rail shipments, a traffic volume too low to sustain the line according to BNSF. To ensure continued rail service, the three previous customers served by the spur and a fourth company joined with other investors to form the Ballard Terminal Railroad Company, LLC in 1997. The Ballard Terminal Railroad refurbished two locomotives and approached the state of Washington seeking approximately $300,000 in financing to refurbish the track. The railroad began operation in early 1998 with a 1940s-era locomotive formerly belonging to the Milwaukee Road. Locomotives The EMD SW1 locomotive operated by the Ballard Terminal Railroad, nicknamed \\"Li'l Beaver.\\" Ballard Terminal Railroad operates one locomotive, an EMD SW1 locomotive numbered 98 formerly owned by Milwaukee Road. The locomotive's black, red and silver livery and nickname, \\"Li'l Beaver\\", pay tribute to the colors and mascot of nearby Ballard High School. Eastside Freight Railroad operates an EMD SW1200 locomotive numbered 109 built in 1963 for the Missouri Pacific. Eastside Freight purchased the locomotive from Tacoma Rail in 2009, which had it listed as surplus property. Meeker Southern Railroad operates an EMD SW9 locomotive numbered 103. Routes The Ballard Terminal Railroad operates three rail lines in the greater Seattle area. =Ballard Terminal= Ballard Terminal Railroad train operating immediately north of the grounds of the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks. The Ballard Terminal Railroad spur begins at its connection to the BNSF mainline at the Shilshole yard just north of N.W. 68th Street. The line follows a route along Seaview Avenue N.W. toward Shilshole Ave N.W. which the line parallels until N.W. 45th Street. The line follows N.W. 45th Street until Leary Way N.W., which the line then parallels, passing the Bright Street Yard, then reaching its terminus at N.W. 40th Street and 6th Ave N.W. near the border between the Ballard and Fremont neighborhoods. The Ballard Terminal Railroad owns its tracks outright, but has a 30-year lease on the land underneath, which belongs to the city of Seattle. Most of the railroad was originally part of the Great Northern Railway's main line, moved to the west when the Lake Washington Ship Canal was built. =Meeker Southern= Meeker Southern Railroad's segment runs from East Puyallup (\\"Meeker\\") to McMillan, Washington. =Eastside Freight= Eastside Freight Railroad, which started operation in 2009 on the former BNSF Railway's Woodinville Subdivision, is a segment from Snohomish to Woodinville.

Kohala is an estimated one million years old--so old that it experienced, and recorded, the reversal of earth's magnetic field 780,000 years ago. It is believed to have breached sea level more than 500,000 years ago and to have last erupted 120,000 years ago. Kohala is in area and in volume, and thus constitutes just under 6% of the island of Hawaii. Kohala is a shield volcano cut by multiple deep gorges, which are the product of thousands of years of erosion. Unlike the typical symmetry of other Hawaiian volcanoes, Kohala is shaped like a foot. Toward the end of its shield-building stage 250,000 to 300,000 years ago, a landslide destroyed the northeast flank of the volcano, reducing its height by over and traveling across the sea floor. This huge landslide may be partially responsible for the volcano's foot-like shape. Marine fossils have been found on the flank of the volcano, far too high to have been deposited by standard ocean waves. Analysis indicated that the fossils had been deposited by a massive tsunami approximately 120,000 years ago. Because it is so far from the nearest major landmass, the ecosystem of Kohala has experienced geographic isolation, resulting in a unique ecosystem. There are several initiatives to preserve this ecosystem against invasive species. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been cultivated on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.

Beginning 300,000 years ago, the rate of eruption slowly decreased over a long period of time to a point where erosion wore the volcano down faster than Kohala rebuilt itself through volcanic activity. Decreasing eruptions combined with increasing erosion caused Kohala to slowly weather away and subside into the ocean. The oldest lava flows that are still exposed at the surface are just under 780,000 years old. It is difficult to determine the original size and shape of the volcano, as the southeast flank has been buried by volcanic lava flows from nearby Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. However, based on a sharp increase of incline on the submarine slope of the volcano at a depth of , scientists estimate that in its prime the portion of Kohala that was above the water was more than wide. Geologists estimate that the volcano was once about twice its current size. The volcano is so old that it experienced, and recorded, a reversal of magnetic polarity (a change in the orientation of Earth's magnetic field so that the positions of the North and South poles interchange) that happened 780,000 years ago. Fifty flow units in the top of exposed strata in the Pololu section are of normal polarity, indicating that they were deposited within the last 780,000 years. Radiometric dating ranged mostly from 450,000 to 320,000 years ago, although several pieces strayed lower; this indicated a period of eruptive history at the time. Cliffs as seen from the beach at Waipio Valley Kohala was devastated by a massive landslide between 250,000 and 300,000 years before present. Debris from the slide was found on the ocean floor up to away from the volcano. Twenty kilometers wide at the shoreline, the landslide cut back to the summit of the volcano, and is partially, if not largely, responsible for the volcano losing in height since then. The famous sea cliffs of the windward Kohala shoreline stand as evidence of the massive geologic disaster, and mark the topmost part of the debris from this ancient landslide. There are also several other unique features found on the volcano, all marks made by the decimating collapse. Kohala is thought to have last erupted 120,000 years ago. However, several samples of a more recent date have been obtained. Two samples collected about apart, obtained from Waipio Valley on the volcano's east flank in 1977, were dated reliably to 60,000 years. Another double set of samples, collected from the western part in 1996, was measured to be 80,000 years in age. The samples have been treated with skepticism by the scientific community, and their ages have been directly challenged. The rocks collected from the west site have not been tested by subsequent experiments. The lava samples collected from the eastern site were allegedly found under a Mauna Loa lava flow, which had been previously dated to 187,000 years. The Kohala lava flows could be as young as 120,000 years although they may be even younger. In 2004, unidentified marine fossils were found at the base of the volcano inshore. A research team led by University of Hawaii's Gary McMurtry and Dave Tappin of the British Geological Survey found that the fossils had been deposited by a massive tsunami, above the current sea level. The team dated the fossils and nearby volcanic rock at about 120,000 years old. Based on the rate of Kohala's subsidence over the past 475,000 years, it was estimated that the fossils were deposited at a height of about , well out of reach of storms and far above the normal sea level at the time. The timing corresponds with the last great landslide of nearby Mauna Loa. Researchers hypothesize that the underwater landslide from the nearby volcano triggered a gigantic tsunami, which swept up coral and other small marine organisms, depositing them on the western face of Kohala. Mauna Loa, an active volcano, has since repaired its flank. Marine geologist Tappin believes that a \\"future collapse on this volcano, with the potential for mega-tsunami generation, is almost certain.\\" =Structure= Kohala had two active rift zones, a characteristic common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, was active in both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, as indicated by the relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000 years old. Older lava dated from the toe of the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2 million years old. Geologists have classified the volcano's lava flows into two units. The Hawi Volcanic layers were deposited in the postshield stage of the volcano's life, and the younger Pololu Volcanics were deposited in the volcano's shield-building stage. The rock in the younger Hawi section, which overlies the older Pololu flows, is mostly 260,000 to 140,000 years old, and composed mainly of hawaiite and trachyte. The separation between the two layers is not clear; the lowest layers may actually be in the Pololu section, based on their depositional patterns and low phosphorus content. The time intervals separating the two periods of volcanic evolution were extremely brief, something first noted in 1988. The forest-covered summit of the volcano consists of many cones which generated lava from its two rift zones between 240,000 and 120,000 years ago. Kohala completed its shield-building stage 245,000 years ago and has been in decline ever since. Potassium-argon dating indicates that the volcano last erupted about 120,000 years ago in the late Pleistocene. Kohala is currently in transition between the postshield and erosional Hawaiian volcanic stages in the life cycle of Hawaiian volcanoes. The United States Geological Survey has assessed the extinct Kohala as a low-risk area. The volcano is in zone 9 (bottom risk), while the border of the volcano with Mauna Kea is zone 8 (second lowest), as Mauna Kea has not produced lava flows for 4,500 years. Radar imaging of Kohala's flank demonstrating its deeply dissected valleys. Kohala, like other shield volcanoes, has a shallow surface slope due to the low viscosity of the lava flows that formed it; however, the northwest shoreline boasts some of the highest seacliffs on earth. Events during and after its eruptions give the volcano several unique geomorphic features, some possibly resulting from the ancient collapse and landslide. The volcano is shaped like a foot; the northeast coast is prominently indented across of shoreline. There is a small string of faults on and near the main summit caldera, arranged parallel to the northern coast. The faults were originally regarded to be a direct result of the collapse; however scientists note the fault lines do not go all the way to the coast but are arranged tightly clustered around the caldera. This indicates that the fault lines may have been caused indirectly, possibly due to the sudden release of stress during the event. Hydrology Waipio Valley, the most prominent valley cutting into the volcano's flank Mauna Kea causes the trade winds to divert around it, increasing wind to super-enhanced flow over the Kohala ridge and orographic lift brings most of the rainfall to the northeastern slope of Kohala. The windward side of Kohala mountain is dissected by multiple, deeply eroded stream valleys in a southwest-northeast alignment, cutting into the flanks of the volcano. North of Kohala's summit the volcano's northwest-southeast trending rift zone separates rainfall into two streams, going southeast, into Waipio Valley, or northwest, into Honokane Nui Valley. When the volcano was still active, vertical sheets of magma, arranged in what is known as dikes, forced their way out of the magma reservoir and intruded into the rift zone, which was weakened by the collapse. As the dikes forced their way up, they formed fractures and faults parallel to the rift zone. The exertion caused by the dikes produced a series of faults along its length, forming horsts and grabens (fault blocks). Northeast of the Kohala summit, where the most rainfall occurs, the faulted structure prevents summit rainwater from naturally flowing northeast down the mountain slope. Instead, the rainwater flows down laterally and empties into the back of what have thus become the largest valleys (Waipio and Honokane Nui). Landsat satellite composite of Kohala, showing its foot-like shape. Two of the deep gorges visible in this photo are Waipio and Waimanu Valleys. All of the gorges visible lie on the east side, the result of trade winds. The leeward northwestern slope of Kohala has few stream valleys cut into it, the result of the rain shadow effect, as the dominant trade winds bring most of the rainfall to the northeastern slope of the volcano. The seven windward valleys of Kohala are, from southeast to northwest, Waipio, Waimanu, Honopue, Honokea, Honokane Iki, Honokane Nui, and Pololu. The size of the valleys reflects the amount of drainage they have been able to capture; Waipio, the largest, at some point drained Waimanu Valley as well, and the former headwaters of Waimanu are now one of its branches. Waimanu valley, cut off from its headwaters to the summit and left with Wai'ilikahi as its main tributary, still had managed to form a substantial floodplain, although less than half the size of Waipio. Honokane Nui, the third largest valley, has its drainage almost exclusively from the north side of the summit, and as a result is a deep, long, narrow bottomed valley with little habitable floodplain. The remaining valleys derive all their water from the lower northeastern slopes of the volcano, and as a result are smaller. In addition, there are innumerable gulches of various depths which have not yet reached sea level and began to form flood plains, becoming valleys. Still, some of these are more than in depth. The depth of the actual valley walls at the seashore range from at the Waipio Valley Lookout at the southeastern corner of Kohala mountain, to a high of over in Honopue, then diminishing to less than at Pololu Lookout at the northern end of the valleys. In the back, deeper in the mountain, all of the valleys have sheer walls well in excess of . Numerous spectacular waterfalls cascade or fall over these cliffs. Some, such as Hi'ilawe Falls in Waipi'o valley, have single drops exceeding . The volcano stayed active well into the formation of these mountainside valleys, as illustrated by later Pololu lava flows, which covered the north and northwestern end of Kohala volcano and often flowed into Pololu Valley. Recent seafloor mapping seems to show that the valley extends a short way beyond the seashore, then terminates at what may be the headwall of the great landslide found off the northeast coast of Kohala. In addition to being a primary factor in the development of the largest valleys, the dike complex plays another important role --that of creating and maintaining the water table. Hawaiian lava is extremely permeable and porous. Rainwater easily seeps into the lava, creating a large lens of fresh water below the island surface. In most places, the top of the water table is just a few feet from sea level, as the fresh water lens is floating on salt water. Unlike porous lava flows, however, dikes cool underground into dense rock with few cracks and vesicles. The dikes act as impermeable vertical walls through which groundwater cannot flow. Deep layers of ash compact into impermeable layers between lava flows, preventing percolation of the rainwater. Rainwater that would ordinarily seep right through the ground gets trapped in the dike \\"reservoirs,\\" located well above sea level. The groundwater is confined to a flow along the dike until it finds a means to escape. In Kohala, the numerous dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from seeping downslope to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go. Rather, the Kohala dike complex guides it northwest or southeast, down the axis of the rift zones, just like the surface water. On the other hand, the three smaller valleys between the large ones - Honopue, Honokea, and Honokane Iki - as well as the many smaller gulches which are not yet valleys, are deprived of groundwater by the orientation of the rift zone and its dikes. Without the large amount of water that is received by the bigger valleys, these valleys grow far more slowly. Due to its topography as essentially a flat crater floor surrounded by cones and fault scarps, the main caldera is affected relatively little by erosion from water. Most of Kohala's summit groundwater ends up in either Waipi'o or Honokane Nui; the enormous amount of water routed through these valleys results in a large amount of water erosion, which causes the valley walls to frequently collapse, accelerating valley development. This abundance of surface water inspired the first of Kohala's three massive irrigation diversion \\"ditches\\", the Upper Hamakua Ditch, although the water was initially used for transporting (\\"fluming\\") sugarcane to the mills rather than irrigation. Surface water supplies, however, were not stable enough for the large scale plantation economy developing in Hamakua and North Kohala, so later ditches tapped the spring fed base flows of the valleys and larger gulches. Only Waimanu Valley escaped with none of its tributaries tapped, along with the 16 smaller streams between Waikoloa Stream and the Wailoa river in Waipi'o Valley. Ecology The multi-storied canopy of a native wet forest on Kohala Mountain. The natural habitats in the Kohala district range across a wide rainfall gradient in a very short distance--from less than a year on the coast near Kawaihae, to more than a year near the summit of Kohala Mountain, a distance of just . At the coast are remnants of dry forests, and near the summit lies a cloud forest, a type of rainforest that obtains much of its moisture from \\"cloud drip\\" in addition to precipitation. These large cloud forests dominate its slopes. This biome is rare, and contains a disproportionate percentage of the world's rare and endemic species. The soil at Kohala is nitrogen-rich, facilitating root growth. The forest lies perpendicular to the prevailing trade winds, a characteristic that leads to frequent cloud formation and abundant rainfall. Thus the rain forests carpeting Kohala are vital to the supply of groundwater on the island. The role of Kohala's ecosystem in supporting water flow has long been recognized. As early as 1902, US Forester E. M. Griffith wrote \\"Forest protection means not only increasing the rainfall, but more important still, conserving the water supply. The future welfare and agricultural prosperity of the Hawaiian Islands depends upon the preservation of the forest.\\" Before humans arrived, the wildlife population at Kohala and on the rest of the island was isolated from other species, as it was separated from the nearest major landmass by over of open water. The early colonizers of Kohala came by wind, storm or floating on the ocean. Successful colonizations occur on the magnitude of once every 35,000 years. The 2,000 successful ancestors that arrived at Kohala evolved into about 8,500 to 12,500 unique species, resulting in a very high ratio of the species present being found nowhere else on Earth. Only about 2.5% of the world's rainforest is cloud rainforest, making it a unique habitat as well. A native oha wai, or Clermontia species, a common flowering shrub of Kohala Mountain's wet forest. The mountain supports approximately 155 native species of vertebrates, crustaceans, mollusks, and plants. A diverse complexion of fungi, liverwort, and mosses further add to the variety. In fact, up to a quarter of the plants in the forest are mosses and ferns. These work to capture the water from clouds, in turn providing microhabitats for invertebrates and amphibians, and their predators. Estimates on the water capacity of the forest range from . The mountain is also home to several bogs, which exist as breaks in the cloud forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an accumulation of water that impedes the root systems of woody plants. Kohala's bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus Sphagnum, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests. The same isolation that produced Kohala's unique ecosystem also makes it very vulnerable to invasive species. Alien plants and feral animals are among the greatest threats to the local ecology. Plants like the kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) and the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleinum) displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents never made it onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation. Kohala's native Hawaiian rain forest has a thick layer of ferns and mosses carpeting the floor, which act as sponges, absorbing water from rain and passing much of it through to the groundwater in aquifers below; when feral animals like pigs trample the covering, the forest loses its ability to hold in water effectively, and instead of recharging the aquifer, it results in a severe loss of topsoil, much of which ends up being dumped by streams into the ocean. Human history Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) of the type grown on Kohala. There is evidence of pre-modern agriculture on the leeward slopes of Kohala. From 1400 to 1800, the principal crop grown at Kohala was sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), although there is also evidence of yams (Dioscorea sp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), bananas (Musa hybrids), sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), and gourds of the family Cucurbitaceae. The optimal rainfall level for the sweet potato lies between per year. A combination of factors makes the rainfall at Kohala variable both from location to location and from year to year. In addition, Kohala is buffeted by strong winds, which are directly correlated to soil erosion; ancient farmers utilized a series of earthen embarkments and stone walls to protect their crops. This technique has been shown to reduce wind by at least 20-30 percent. In addition to walls, there are a series of stone paths that divided the farmed area into plots of variable size. These structures are unique because although many people used such systems at the time, Kohala has some of the few to survive. The leeward slopes of Kohala were used for sugarcane plantations in the late 19th century. The trip from the fields to the mills and then boats was mechanized by steam locomotive in 1883. Several plantations on the mountain were consolidated into the Kohala Sugar Company by 1937. At the peak of its production, the company had 600 employees, of land, and a capacity of of raw sugar per year. In 1975 the company finally closed down. The northern Kohala district, centered on the town of Hawi Kohala supports a very complex hydrological cycle. In the early part of the 20th century, this was exploited by building surface irrigational channels designed to capture water at the higher elevations and distribute it to the then- extensive sugarcane industry. In 1905, after 18 months and the loss of 17 lives, the Kohala Ditch, a vast network of flumes and ditches, measuring in length, was completed. It has since come into use by ranches, farms, and homes. A portion of the ditch became a tourist attraction until it was damaged by the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, centered just southwest of the mountain. The Hawaii County Department of Water Supply relies on streams from Kohala to supply water to the population of the island. With increasing demand, the original surface channels have been supplemented by deep wells designed to channel groundwater for domestic use. In 2003 the Kohala Watershed Partnership was formed, a voluntary group of private land owners and state managers, designed to help manage the Kohala watershed and to protect it from threats, most especially invasive species. Another project to raise awareness of Kohala's ecosystem is The Kohala Center, an independent, not-for-profit, community-based organization for research and education. It was established as a response to requests by island residents to create an educational and employment opportunity related to Hawaii's natural and cultural significance. The center's mission is \\"to respectfully engage the Island of Hawaii as an extraordinary and vibrant research and learning laboratory for humanity.\\" The land around Kohala is administered as two districts, North Kohala and South Kohala, of the County of Hawaii. The beaches, parks, golf courses, and resorts in South Kohala are called \\"the Kohala Coast.\\" King Kamehameha I, the first King of the unified Hawaiian Islands, was born near Upolu Point, the northern tip of Kohala. The site is within Kohala Historical Sites State Monument. The original Kamehameha Statue stands in front of the community center in Kapaau, and replicas of the statue are found at Alii≈çlani Hale in Honolulu, and in Emancipation Hall at the United States Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, D.C.

Rows are as follows: Overprinting refers to the process of printing one colour on top of another in reprographics. This is closely linked to the reprographic technique of 'trapping'. Another use of overprinting is to create a rich black (often regarded as a colour that is \\"blacker than black\\") by printing black over another dark colour. It is also the term used in the production of envelopes customised to order by printing images (such as logos) and texts (such as slogans) on mass-produced machine- made envelopes; the alternative way of producing such envelopes is to print \\"on the flat\\" and then cut out the individual shapes and fold them to form the envelopes. However the latter method is generally only economically viable for large print runs offering returns to scale. Overprinting also refers to the printing of additional information onto self-adhesive labels and product packaging. \\"Best Before\\", \\"Use By\\" dates and batch codes are printed in situ onto product packaging as the items are packed. Generally thermal printers, ink jet printers or laser printers are used.

In 1900, Germany issued the \\"Yachts,\\" a common design used for all of Germany's colonies, featuring the Kaiser's yacht Hohenzollern. In German East Africa they were denominated in pesas and rupees (64 pesas to a rupee), and inscribed \\"DEUTSCH-OSTAFRIKA\\".

Germany continued to print stamps during the war, issuing a 1-rupee watermarked Yacht in 1916 (genuine uses of this stamp are extremely rare, worth US$20,000 or more).  Occupation  After the colony was occupied by Belgian and British troops, each issued its own provisional stamps. In 1916, the Belgians overprinted stamps of Belgian Congo in several ways, first with \\"RUANDA\\" and \\"URUNDI,\\" although these were never actually used.

CNU is the youngest comprehensive university in the commonwealth of Virginia. The institution is named after Christopher Newport, who was a buccaneer (or privateer) and captain of Susan Constant, the largest of three ships which carried settlers for the Virginia Company in 1607, on their way to found Jamestown in the Virginia Colony, which became the first permanent English settlement in North America. History In 1960 the city of Newport News joined together with the Commonwealth of Virginia to create Christopher Newport College (CNC), which opened its doors in 1961 and at the time was located in the old John W. Daniel School building. The college was founded as an extension of the College of William & Mary and offered extension courses that had already been available in the area for some time. In 1964 the college was relocated to its current location, a tract of land purchased and donated by the city. In this same year, the college's first permanent building was dedicated as Christopher Newport Hall. In 1971, CNC became a four-year college;(Quarstein 179) however, it remained an extension of William & Mary until 1977 when it attained its independence.(Quarstein 209) In 1992, the college became a university under the leadership of President Anthony R. Santoro, who oversaw the building of the first residence hall. In 1996, CNU made plans to become more competitive. Those plans included the expansion of university property, several new buildings and residence halls, as well as overhauling academic programs and the admission process. =Presidents= *H.

In the recent years, new policies have been enacted that require all freshman and sophomore students to live in an on campus housing facility, unless they live in the commuting zone. Starting with the class of 2014, all students must live on campus during the junior year in addition to their freshman and sophomore years. ;Freshman housing The oldest housing facility on campus is Santoro Hall. Opened in 1992, the hall was named in honor of then President Anthony Santoro and his wife, Carol. This building is directly adjacent to one of the campus dining facilities, the Hiden-Hussey Commons. Santoro Hall, along with the newer York River Hall, is primarily used for freshman housing. York River Hall opened in 2002. This complex, consisting of two buildings (York River East/ York River West), houses over 500 students and is the largest residence hall on campus. Both Santoro and York River Halls are suite-style living residence halls. In each building, pairs of neighboring housing units share a common private restroom. Freshman also live in portions of Potomac River Hall. ;Upperclassmen housing York River Hall Sophomore housing currently consists of James River Hall, opened in 2000, half of Potomac River Hall, opened in 2004, as well as Warwick River Hall, opened in 2012. James River Hall boasts a variety of floor plans, including 4-, 5-, and 6-person apartments, 4-person suites, and three 15-person Theme Units. Potomac Hall, like York River Hall, is divided into two buildings (North/ South), and consists of suites of two bedrooms, located around a central living room and bath. Warwick River Hall is the newest residence hall on campus and accommodates 447 students in 4-, 5-, and 6-person suites each with a shared living room and bathroom. Rappahannock River Hall at Christopher Newport UniversityJuniors and Seniors living on campus are generally assigned to either East Campus or Rappahannock River Hall. James River Hall also accommodates Juniors and Seniors in apartment style dorms. CNU is currently planning construction on a dedicated upperclassmen residence, to be called \\"Shenandoah Hall.\\" It is expected to house more than 200 seniors and to open in summer 2020. Starting in 2009, five sororities and four fraternities live in Barclay Apartments, CNU's temporary Greek Village, and any additional fraternities and sororities live in the adjacent townhouses of CNU Landing . Completed in 2002, CNU Apartments is a complex of five buildings of three or four stories, housing up to 355 students. These buildings, named after Virginia-born presidents, include Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Harrison, and Monroe. The CNU Village rose to accompany CNU Apartments in 2005, adding room for an additional 398 students in apartment living. Both the apartments and the Village feature 2 to 4 single bedroom apartments with a common living area (full kitchen, living room/dinette, washer and dryer). Below CNU Village, along Warwick Blvd., are a variety of eating establishments including Panera Bread, Moe's Southwest Grill, Subway, 7-11, Sushi & Spice, and Schooners, opened by three local restaurateurs who wanted to fill a void left by the lack of a social outlet on campus. =The David Student Union= The David Student Union The David Student Union (DSU) is a $36 million, facility whose construction began in 2003 and opened September 9, 2006. Constructed in a \\"Neo-Georgian\\" architectural style, the first floor contains the campus Convenience Store, parallel the DSU dining facilities: The Discovery Bistro, Discovery Cafe, Chick-fil-A, Discovery Pizza, and Regatta's. The campus Bookstore and Convenience Store closed during the Fall 2010 semester in favor of an online bookstore and instead contains a student lounge, admissions office, and apparel store. All on-campus students receive a mailbox and access to a full- service Post Office located on the second floor of the DSU. Four large conference rooms named for past U.S. Presidents are located around a central lobby area at the top of the steps. The Ballroom is also located on the second floor. The building provides offices for Student Life, The Captain's Log, Career Development, International Studies, Academic Advising, and others. Private desks with computers are provided for students as well as quiet study sections and recreational areas. The building was named in honor of William R. and Goldie R. David. =Academic buildings= For the opening of the Spring 2010 semester, Christopher Newport University opened the Lewis Archer McMurran, Jr. Hall. This building has neo-Georgian architecture. The building is 85,000 square feet and frames the university's Great Lawn on its western side. McMurran Hall houses the Departments of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures, History, English, and Government. It has a 150-person lecture hall, two 50-person lecture halls, and over 25 other classrooms. To the north of McMurran Hall is Ratcliffe Hall, the former home of the Departments of English and Government. Once CNU's gymnasium, the building was renovated to include classroom and office space for students and faculty. Other academic buildings on campus include Gosnold Hall, Forbes Hall, and the Business and Technology Center (BTC Building), located across Prince Drew Lane. Finally, the Ferguson Center for the Arts is home to the Departments of Music and Theater & Dance. Wingfield Hall, the former home of the Departments of Psychology and Language, was demolished in 2011 to make way for the Joseph W. Luter Hall, home of the school of business. The Joseph W. Luter, III Hall is the house of the Luter School of Business. The building, following the Neo- Georgian architecture of surrounding new structures, has a new 100-seat tiered lecture hall, 14 traditional classrooms, teachings labs, research labs and faculty offices. The Mary Brock Forbes Integrated Science Building is a academic hall situated on the north edge of the great lawn, and houses the College of Natural and Behavioral Science as well as the Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science and Psychology departments. It also includes spaces for students to interact, 50 faculty offices, a large lecture hall, 50 classrooms, and research labs. =The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library= The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library reading room The entrance to Christopher Newport University, featuring the York River Hall freshman residence hall, the Trible Library, and the Pope Chapel. The university's library, renamed for Rosemary and Paul S. Trible, Jr., had a multimillion-dollar addition completed in early 2008. The new facility houses most of its collection in the original section. The new library was dedicated January 24, 2008, and fully opened at the start of the Spring 2008 semester. The Trible Library boasts a new Einstein's Cafe, a 24-hour study lounge, and an IT help desk. In early 2009, the Mariners' Museum Library relocated to the Trible Library, providing students and the community with convenient access to the largest maritime history collection in the Western Hemisphere. The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library was slated for another expansion beginning in 2016 which would add another floor to the back portion of the facility. Due to the renovations, the Mariners' Museum Library moved back to the Mariners' Museum and reopened in Fall 2017. In August 2018, the library expansion opened adding 3 floors of new space. Additions included a 100-seat theater, expanded Media Center, a two-story reading room, and 44 group study rooms. =Ferguson Center for the Arts= In 1996 the university acquired the Ferguson High School building and property, which was adjacent to campus. This building was used for classrooms until it was extensively renovated to become the Ferguson Center for the Arts, which opened in fall of 2005. Many features of the original high school, which was located between what is now the concert hall and the music and theatre hall, can still be seen throughout the current building. It houses a 1,725-seat concert hall which is acoustically engineered so that anyone on stage can be heard from any seat without a microphone, A 453-seat music and theatre hall, and a 200-seat studio theatre. It also contains two art galleries, a dance studio, and several classrooms. =Pope Chapel= Opened in early 2013, the Pope Chapel, named for Larry Pope of Smithfield Foods, is a gathering place for various on campus religious organizations located at the campus entrance across from York River Hall and the Trible Library. =Christopher Newport Hall= Christopher Newport Hall during the May 2015 commencement ceremony. In the fall of 2015 a new administration building was opened and named Christopher Newport Hall. The structure houses the Office of Admission, Office of the Registrar, Financial Aid, Housing, the Center for Academic Success, the President's Leadership Program and the Center for Career Planning, among others. The $42 million facility serves as a new landmark on campus and is at the head of the Great Lawn opposite Lewis Archer McMurran, Jr. Hall. In May 2015, towards the end of construction, Newport Hall served as the backdrop for commencement ceremonies.

On October 10, 1918, he achieved distinction by killing four German machine gunners, using a standard-issue 1903 Springfield with open sights, near Verdun during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The gunners had pinned his platoon down and his actions secured safety to advance for the platoon. In another instance, Davis shot and killed five members of an enemy crew that was setting up a machine gun 1,000 yards away in an area they thought was out of range of American troops.

Advertising and civic life He graduated in 1921 and began work for advertising agencies in New York City and Chicago until 1929, after which he co-founded Benton & Bowles with Chester Bowles in New York. He moved to Norwalk, Connecticut in 1932, and served as the part-time vice president of the University of Chicago from 1937 to 1945. In 1944, he had entered into unsuccessful negotiations with Walt Disney to make six to twelve educational films annually.Gabler, Neal, Walt Disney: the triumph of the American imagination, New York : Random House, 2006. . Cf. p. 444 Public and elected office life He was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and held the position from August 31, 1945 to September 30, 1947, during which time he was active in organizing the United Nations. He was appointed to the United States Senate on 17 December 1949 by his old partner Chester Bowles (who had been elected Governor in 1948), and subsequently elected in the general election on 7 November 1950 as a Democrat to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Raymond E. Baldwin in December 1949 for the remainder of the term ending 3 January 1953. In the November 1950 election, he defeated Republican party candidate Prescott Sheldon Bush, father of U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush and grandfather of U.S. President George W. Bush. In 1951 he introduced a resolution to expel Joseph McCarthy from the Senate. On television, when asked if he would take any action against Benton's reelection bid, McCarthy replied, \\"I think it will be unnecessary. Little Willie Benton, Connecticut's mental midget keeps on... it will be unnecessary for me or anyone else to do any campaigning against him. He's doing his campaigning against himself.\\" Benton lost in the general election for the full term in 1952 to William A. Purtell. Benton's comeback bid failed in 1958 when, running against Bowles and Thomas Dodd he failed to win the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. He was later appointed United States Ambassador to UNESCO in Paris and served from 1963 to 1968.

The book includes background information, illustrations, and game rules for these races. The Orcs and Goblins represent a generic Dark Ages warband army with little internal cohesion and discipline, and relying on the ferocious charge and individual fighting skills rather than organized generalship. Contents Orcs & Goblins contains a number of short stories that provide an illustrative fictional history of the Orcs in the Warhammer Fantasy universe. These stories center around the formation of WAAAGH!s and the resulting campaigns. =Gorbad Ironclaw= Gorbad Ironclaw, atop his vicious boar Gnarla, was the mightiest Warlord that ever lived (in the warhammer fantasy universe). Gorbad Ironclaw and his tribe, the Ironclaw Orcs, absorbed the Broken Tooth tribe along with the local Goblin and Night Goblin tribes, to create a massive force of Greenskin warriors. The tribe marched through Black Fire Pass to attack the Empire under the Emperor Sigismund. Gorbad's army conquered the territories of Solland and Wissenland, but Gorbad himself was wounded in the fighting. At the fortress of Altdorf, the Waaagh! was kept at bay outside the city walls. Gorbad unleashed Wyverns upon the city, who threw the defenders into disarray but were ultimately repelled without achieving their main objective, which was to destroy the city gates. Eventually, the lack of progress and Gorbad's injury took their toll on morale, and the army disintegrated. The remnants of Gorbad's tribe were ambushed and defeated on their way home by a Dwarf army under the King of Karaz-a-Karak. It is not known if Gorbad survived the encounter. =Azhag the Slaughterer= An already powerful warlord who ruled over a great many tribes in the Badlands, Azhag's tale truly began after he unearthed an ancient magic crown in the ruined city of Todtheim. But this was no simple trinket: this was the Crown of Sorcery, an ancient artifact of the Great Necromancer, Nagash, and the ancient Liche's insidious spirit still clung to the artifact. When Azhag put the crown on, Nagash's spirit began to dominate the Orc's crude, uncomplicated psyche, and from then on, Azhag's primal power was combined with Nagash's tactical genius and arcane fury. The power of the Crown allowed Azhag to destroy the rival Warbosses and ensure the loyalty of his followers. Prior to battle, Azhag would lay out his plan of attack, speaking in a decidedly un-Orcy voice heavy with the weight of centuries, then bellow at his ladz to get moving. However, Azhag's continued victories ensured the support of his greenskin followers: they didn't care that he \\"talked funny,\\" only that he showed them \\"where da fighting wuz!\\" Armed with Nagash's tactical skill and sorcerous might, which granted Azhag impressive magical skill, and mounted on the back of his pet wyvern Skullmuncha, Azhag's uncannily organised and tactically skilled WAAAGH! invaded the Empire, laying waste to the eastern province of Ostermark. They ravaged the province for many long months before Azhag's force was finally defeated at the Battle of Osterwald. In the ferocious fighting, Werner von Kriegstadt, Grand Master of the Knights Panther, killed Azhag in single combat and recovered the Crown of Sorcery. Without his tactical mind and force of will to lead them, the Orcs that had followed Azhag fled into the forests and hills of Ostland. As for the Crown of Sorcery, after much debate between those who wanted it preserved and studied, and those who wanted it destroyed so its evil could pose no more threat, the Grand Theogonist took it back to Altdorf and sealed it in the Imperial Vaults, where it would remain for all eternity. =Grimgor Ironhide= Grimgor Ironhide is the most violent Black Orc Warboss ever to exist. He leads tribes of vicious Orcs to lay waste all across the Old World. His personal bodyguard of Black Orcs are known as \\"Da Immortulz\\" and they are almost as dangerous as he is. Grimgor is a fearsome fighter who can inflict enormous casualties upon opposing units. He \\"rests\\" by going into the tunnels of Red Eye Mountain (the Former Dwarf hold of Karak Ungor) that is held by Night Goblin allies. Here he slaughters vast numbers of Skaven, who are constantly trying to take the keep from the Greenskins. Unknown to Grimgor he has often got close to the Skaven area known as \\"Hell Pit\\", where the Skaven carry out their twisted experiments. Grimgor leaves the tunnels when he tires of killing Skaven, but invariably returns for another \\"rest\\" when the urge to explore and kill reasserts itself. Grimgor's fighting skill is such that he has been fought to a standstill only once - by the Champion of Chaos Crom the Conqueror. This is partly explained by the mauling of Grimgor's army on that occasion and the fleeing of the survivors, which left Grimgor alone on the field of battle. =Units= A Goblin *Orcs are large creatures with long arms and short legs, huge slabs of muscle move under tough green skin, and their jaws are lined with vicious fangs that jut out from their underbite. They have beady red eyes, a generally foul demeanor, and are naturally bald. Normally six feet tall, they are up to seven feet tall when stretched out of their characteristic stoop. They respect power and strength, and naturally tend towards becoming bigger and stronger as they rise through their society. While they lack the education of more advanced races, Orcs possess immense cunning and are quick learners, but rarely adopt new tactics to replace their fondness for close quarters brutality. *Goblins are much smaller and skinnier than the Orcs and have long, pointed noses. They are between 4 and 5 feet high, seldom reaching the height of a man. Goblins are more common than orcs, and deceitful to a fault. They prefer attacking their opponents in the back or from a safe distance. When pressed into battle Goblins seek safety in numbers, attacking in large mobs. They are afraid of Elves because they \\"stink funny.\\" *Snotlings are smaller and weaker than goblins; about half their height, although there is no set point where a large snotling becomes a small goblin, or vice versa. They are far less intelligent than goblins and can do little except in imitation of others. They congregate on the edges of greenskin villages, hunting (and being hunted by) squigs, although they are often too terrified to approach these strange creatures. *Gnoblars were not well known to the Old World until expeditions from the Ogre Kingdoms became commonplace. They serve as \\"pets\\" who are used to scavenge battlefields and carry luggage. Gnoblars are between normal goblins and snotlings in size and hence hierarchy. Gnoblars are not part of the Orcs & Goblins army in Warhammer Fantasy. Gnoblars do jobs for the Ogres in return for the Ogres' protection. Publication history Reception Orcs & Goblins was reviewed in Dragon #203 (March 1994).

Subsequent stamps were also overprinted, through 1881. Unoverprinted Portuguese stamps were used from 1881 to 1892. From 1892 to 1905, while the administrative title of Madeira was changed to the District of Funchal, definitive stamps were issued with the inscription \\"Funchal\\". In 1898 a series of stamps commemorating Vasco da Gama was issued with the inscription \\"Madeira\\". Subsequently Madeira used stamps of Portugal from 1905, with two exceptions; the first was the Pombal Issue of postal tax stamps in 1925, and a variant on the Ceres design, issued 1 May 1928. The 21 values of Ceres stamps were obligatory on all mail for eight days ‚Äì 1 May, 5 June, 1 July, and 31 December 1928, and 1 January, 31 January, 1 May, and 5 June 1929.

Initially mail was transported by a Spanish packet to and from Puerto Rico; but in July 1867 the British picked up the mail contract, and packet letters are known using British stamps as late as 1879. First stamps The first postage stamp of the Danish West Indies was issued in 1856. It had the same square coat of arms design as the contemporary stamps of Denmark, but it was denominated 3 cents and of a dark carmine color on yellowish paper. A yellow burelage of wavy lines covered the stamp. (In the illustration at right, it is most easily seen along the bottom edge of the larger version.) An 1866 printing was on white paper, with the direction of the burelage lines changed, and in 1872 the stamps were perforated. In 1873 a 4c value in dull blue was issued. 1874 saw the first numeral issues of the same sort as used in Denmark. Values ranged from 1c to 50c; all were bi- colored. Inverted frames are common for several of the lower values. As usual for small colonies far away, the Danish West Indies ran out of popular values periodically, and the colonial administration had to improvise. A 1c surcharge was printed on 7c stamps in 1887, and a 10c surcharge on 50c in 1895. An additional supply of numeral types in new colors came out between 1896 and 1901. Single-color 1c and 5c stamps were issued in 1900 to meet UPU regulations. Shortages of 2c and 8c values led to more surcharges in 1902, rectified in the following year by an issue of those values using the arms design of 1900. Postage due stamps first appeared in 1902 also. Currency reform 20 bit stamp, 1905 As a result of the currency reform, in 1905, new stamps were issued. Values from 5b to 50b had a silhouette of King Christian IX, while 1fr, 2fr, and 5fr depicted the sailing ship Ingolf in St. Thomas harbor. New postage dues were required as well. Additional 5b stamps were produced by surcharging older stamps. A definitive series of 1907 depicted Frederick VIII, followed in 1915 by a series for Christian X. A few types are cheaply available today, such as the low values of the 1907 issue, but most fall into the US$10-20 range. Because the letter-writing population was very small, perhaps just a few hundred persons, used copies are often valued more highly by collectors, and both forged and favor cancellations are known to have been made. When the islands were sold to the United States in 1917 and renamed the United States Virgin Islands, the colony ceased producing its own postage stamps.

He twice served as Prime Minister of Malta (1950‚Äì55 and 1962‚Äì71) as the Leader of the Nationalist Party. He was also Leader of the Opposition between 1955‚Äì58, and again between 1971‚Äì77. Borg Olivier was elected as one of the three Nationalist members of the Council of Government in 1939. In May 1940, when the leader of the Nationalist party, Enrico Mizzi, was first interned by the British and deported, Borg Olivier became interim leader. After his return, Mizzi made Borg Olivier his deputy. Rising to office as a prot√©g√© of Mizzi and Sir Ugo P. Mifsud, Borg Olivier believed in the economic and social development of Malta as a viable independent state and in the necessity of a mixed economy. During his premiership, he pursued corporatist policies to develop the tourism industry and construction as the engine of growth. Under his leadership, average living standards rose steadily as Malta began to decouple from a fortress economy purely dependent on the British military establishment. Near the end of his rule as prime minister, his government was rocked by various political and personal scandals, which seemed to symbolise the moral decay of the Maltese political establishment. Resigning from Leader of the Nationalist Party in 1977, Borg Olivier retained his parliamentary seat until his death in 1980. He was succeeded as leader of the party by Eddie Fenech Adami. Early life =Family= George Borg Olivier was born in Valletta, the son of Olivier Borg Olivier de Puget Paleologo and Rosa (n√©e Amato), and had had a sheltered childhood lived in the Valletta of the 1920s and 1930s. Borg Olivier grew up in a family steeped in Nationalist politics. His uncle Salvatore was speaker of the house and then a senator, and led the opposition to Lord Strickland's Constitutional Party in the 1920s before becoming a cabinet minister during the premiership of Ugo P. Mifsud in the early 1930s. Borg Olivier followed in this uncle's footsteps by becoming a notary. =Education= He was educated at the Lyceum, Malta, and the Royal University of Malta, where he graduated Doctor of Laws in 1937. As a university student, Borg Olivier was elected President of the Comitato Permanente Universitario until it was suppressed by the British colonial government in March 1935. Personal life =Family= Borg Olivier married Alexandra Mattei in 1943. They had one daughter, Angela, and two sons, Alexander and Peter. Alexandra Borg Olivier died on 25 February 2009, aged 87. Peter Borg Olivier died 19 April 2012, aged 62. Political career =Private member (1939‚Äì1950) = The 1930s were particularly trying for Maltese society. War on the continent caused social and cultural tension on the islands. The alignment of local culture with Italy by elements of the social elite appeared to be lackey behaviour towards Fascist Italy. The Partito Nazionale of Enrico Mizzi and Sir Ugo P. Mifsud, the party chosen by Borg Olivier, came under strict scrutiny once war broke out in Europe in 1939. The war led to the exile of Nationalists supporters, including Enrico Mizzi, one of the main leaders of the Partito Nazionale. On 25 June 1939, Borg Olivier addressed his first mass-meeting in Siƒ°ƒ°iewi, a village which also hosted his office as notary public: Borg Olivier played an active role in this election, addressing political meetings in various villages, such as Birkirkara and Bormla. He was one of the three party candidates, together with Mizzi and Mifsud, who made it to the Council of Government in 1939. The Nationalist members' line in the 1939 Council of Government was not obstructionist, however the three members believed that \\"the nation is mature, and quite mature from now to administer the government. It has sufficient talent, sufficient capacity for work and sufficient patriotism.\\" Borg Olivier was also chosen by Lieutenant governor William Dobbie as one of eight Protection Officers. Following the illegal internment and deportation of Maltese citizens, Borg Olivier offered a sustained opposition to the Council's deportations, talking at length and in many occasions against these actions, famously observing that: The internees were returned to Malta in May 1945, and the three Nationalist members of the Council resigned in July, with the Nationalists refusing to participate in the 1945 elections. This was a protest against the imposition of non-administrative government. In 1947, Borƒ° Olivier was elected to the Legislative Assembly and was later Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Boffa Government of 1947 was soon in crisis following Paul Boffa's disagreements with Dom Mintoff. =From Minister to Prime Minister (1950‚Äì1955) = Following the general elections of 1950, Borg Olivier held the post of Minister for Public Works and Reconstruction and Minister of Education in a Nationalist Minority Government led by Enrico Mizzi. Borg Olivier became Prime Minister and Minister of Justice in a Minority Government upon Mizzi's death in December 1950. He was also confirmed leader of the Nationalist Party by the Party's Executive Committee. The obstructionist strategies of the parties in opposition made Borƒ° Olivier bid the Governor, Sir Gerald Creasy, to call for fresh elections. These were held in May 1951, and as a result of them, Borg Olivier formed a coalition Government with the Malta Workers' Party, which was led by erstwhile PM Paul Boffa. Borg Olivier was head of the new government, retaining the Ministry for Public Works and Reconstruction. Re-elected in 1953, the coalition remained in office till 1955. On the political front, these years were marked with the attempt for a proper definition of Malta's constitutional status and relationship with the United Kingdom. One such attempt related to an incident with respect to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Borƒ° Olivier was invited for the ceremony, but refused to attend unless Malta's precedence rights were respected. The difficulties were overcome when the British government agreed to treat the Prime Minister of Malta on an equal basis to the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia and Northern Ireland. This was a diplomatic victory for Borƒ° Olivier, winning him unanimous approval in Parliament. During his stay in London, Borƒ° Olivier presented a memorandum to the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, Henry Hopkinson, explaining the Maltese government's position that Malta ought be transferred from the Colonial Office to the Commonwealth Office, as an independent dominion within the Commonwealth. This was a counter-proposal to the British Government's offer to move Malta under Home Office responsibility. Discussions by a Maltese delegation in May 1953 focused on the legal, constitutional and economic aspects of this question. This was a prelude to the political struggle with Mintoff's Malta Labour Party, which favoured full integration with Britain. =Leader of the Opposition (1955‚Äì1958)= The general elections of 1955, which were lost by the Nationalist party, were linked with the two competing proposals of integration with Britain and dominion status. The imperial authorities on the islands were accused of exerting undue pressure on the electorate by the Nationalist party, with the Governor, Major General Sir Robert Laycock, taking the unheard of step of addressing the electorate over the rediffusion at the start of the electoral campaign. The Nationalist Congress, held 24 April 1955, passed a resolution deploring the \\"scandalous and unconstitutional interference of the Governor.\\" From 1955‚Äì58, Borg Olivier served as Leader of Opposition. He led the Nationalist Party delegations in June and September 1955 for the Malta Round Table Conference. In these meetings, the Nationalist members reiterated that \\"Malta ought be given full autonomy within the Commonwealth, autonomous in its relationship with the United Kingdom, but not with the rest of the Commonwealth and other independent nations. The matters dealing with defense, the Commonwealth and international relationships should be the equal responsibility of the governments of the United Kingdom and Malta.\\" These constitutional demands were not met by the British government, which moved to agree in principle with Mintoff's demands for integration with Britain. A referendum was called, with Borg Olivier calling a boycott of the vote. Although the votes cast showed a substantial majority for integration, the outcome clearly showed that the nation did not approve of the proposals. Coupled with Borƒ° Olivier's attempts to expose British intrusions, and that \\"the Secretary of State for the Colonies is determined to bulldoze integration on the Island,\\" support for the Malta Labour Party's proposal for full integration began to wane. With the decrease in British defence spending, and the British government's unwillingness to set dates for full equality between the Maltese and British people, the integration proposal was effectively dead. At this point, Mintoff resigned and declared a national day of protest. Riots broke out 28 April 1958. The governor declared a state of emergency with troops placed on standby to help the civil police. After Borg Olivier's refusal to form a government, the governor was forced to declare a state of public emergency in Malta, suspending the 1947 Constitution. =Prime Minister (1962‚Äì1971)= Road to Independence Prime Minister George Borg Olivier meeting with US President John F. Kennedy in September, 1963 Following the February 1962 election, Borg Olivier agreed to form a Government after obtaining important amendments to the Constitution. In addition to being Prime Minister, he assumed the portfolio of Minister of Economic Planning and Finance. In the 1962 elections, 76% of the electorate voted for the principal parties which were demanding Independence. The Nationalist Party had suffered an internal split, with Herbert Ganado founding the more populist Democratic Nationalist Party. The Nationalists gained a majority and therefore Borg Olivier became Prime Minister. Shortly afterwards, amendments to the Constitution were made. Borg Olivier proceeded to London to ask for a financial agreement and demand Independence with full membership within the Commonwealth. At the time unemployment had risen to 6% and there were fears of discharges from the Naval Arsenal. On 20 August 1962, Dr Borg Olivier presented a formal request for Independence. It was soon made known that the Attorney General Prof John J. Cremona, was working on a draft constitution while it was announced that a Malta Independence Conference was to be held at Marlborough House, London. The Conference started on 16 July 1963. Delegates from all the political parties led by Borg Olivier, Dom Mintoff, Toni Pellegrini, Herbert Ganado and Mabel Strickland attended. The Conference was chaired by Duncan Sandys. Discussions went on right through July. The Maltese Government was asking for a monarchical state with a Governor General representing the Queen. The Secretary of State proposed a referendum about the constitution. Borg Olivier's shrewdness as a politician enabled him to use the ongoing religious conflict between the Labour Party and the Maltese church, headed by Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi, to his advantage. This was a particular achievement given Borg Olivier's relationship with the Bishop were very strained. However, Borg Olivier was still able to gain a reduction in the clerical and episcopal influence on Maltese politics. This was the tail end of the Maltese Politico-religious dispute, comparable in some ways to the questions arising thirty years earlier, in Strickland's time. Although there was a personality clash between Archbishop Gonzi and Mintoff, other issues of power and jurisdiction were clearly becoming evident in the growing tension between the ecclesiastical sphere and the state. Mass hysteria and campaigns of almost sectarian proportions ensued, with Mintoff and several of his Labour Party colleagues being denied the sacraments and demonised. Borg Olivier was no religious fanatic, and took the politically correct side against his main adversary, riding on the wave of religious sentiment. Privately he argued that the Church's efforts to rally third parties to enter the political fray was damaging his chances. This referred in particular to a second, Church- supported right-wing party led by Herbert Ganado, which had returned four MPs in the 1962 elections. Ganado, along with three other 'pro-church' small parties, two of which with returned MPs, were opposed to independence. Gonzi wanted to check both Mintoff and Borƒ° Olivier, to prevent the loss of the Church's guarded status under a new political system. Both the main political parties, the PN and the MLP, had independence from Britain prominently included in their electoral campaigns. On taking office in 1962, the demand for independence was put on the table quickly enough and preliminary discussions began almost immediately. Borƒ° Olivier tried rather unsuccessfully to get Britain to increase its aid to Malta, to protect against the consequences of the planned 'run down' of British service establishments in Malta. After unsuccessful talks, Borg Olivier retorted that he had not gone to London \\"to make a silver collection\\". From his London hotel on 20 August 1962, Borg Olivier addressed to the secretary of state for the colonies a formal and urgent request for Malta's independence. The main British concern was of course defence, but also security. The violence of 1958 and subsequent events, including manifestations of support for 'neutrality and non-alignment', had rather dented regard for Mintoff and his party generally, not only among the British Conservative Party. The Malta Labour Party tended to be perceived now as departing from or sidelining the Western camp. It was the Nationalists under Borg Olivier who were now seen by the British as the better able to reassure the West, and to offer the best chances for democracy, security, and stability in an independent state. After a controversial referendum in May 1964, in which a majority of the votes cast approved the proposed independence constitution, in July a full round of talks with all the five political parties concerned, led by Borg Olivier as prime minister, was held at Marlborough House in London. The minority view against immediate independence was dismissed. The majority view was hindered by disagreements as to constitutional form, mainly concerning civil and secular entitlements against traditional Roman Catholic presumptions and fears, but one of Mintoff's six points also endorsed the potential justification of violence. The MLP also seemed unenthusiastic about Malta's staying in the Commonwealth, or retaining the George Cross in the national colours. On 13 July 1963, Borg Olivier headed a Government delegation for the Malta Independence Conference at the end of which it was announced that Malta would become independent. On 25 January 1964, Borg Olivier was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sylvester, Pope, by Pope Paul VI. After having had a series of talks with the British Government and after preparing a Constitution for an independent Malta, which was endorsed by Parliament and approved by the people in a referendum held in February 1964, Borg Olivier set 21 September as Malta's Independence Day. Independence was part of a package which included retaining British defence facilities for ten years and financial aid to the tune of ¬£51 million. NATO's Mediterranean branch headquarters, just outside Valletta, was also retained, ensuring that Malta would remain in the Western sphere of influence, while British and NATO forces would continue to benefit from the islands' strategic location. On Independence Day, 21 September 1964, the degree of Doctor of Literature (Honoris Causa) was conferred on Borg Olivier by the Royal University of Malta. In November 1964, he was received by Pope Paul VI and made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Pius IX. Independent Malta In March 1965, he became Minister of Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in addition to his duties as Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Planning and Finance. In the General Elections held in March 1966, the Nationalist Party was again returned to power with Borg Olivier as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. On 14 June 1968, Borg Olivier was decorated with the Grand Cross of Merit of the Order of Malta by the Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta. Borg Olivier's family affairs, which were somewhat disturbed, soon fell under public scrutiny. The marital relationship of the Borg Olivier couple began to be used by all his political opponents as a source of criticism. These scandals were part of the political rhetoric of the 1960s. The Maltese church's teachings still played a cardinal role in local politics. Borg Olivier had jumped on the Church's bandwagon, grasping a substantial political advantage from the Church's excommunication of the Maltese Labour Party. Borg Olivier did not agree with the Church's position, yet he still capitalised on the situation and gave sterling support to the Church's authorities. The introduction of Labour newspapers in public hospitals was banned, a decision later revoked by the courts, while excommunicated citizens were forbidden from being buried in their family graves in public cemeteries. The abuse of Maltese children who had been sent to Australia on the initiative of the Maltese church was another scandal which rocked the country. =Leader of the Opposition (1971‚Äì1977)= As the 1960s came to a close, an economy reeling from over-reliance on construction and labour troubles at the Dockyards endangered Borg Olivier's administration. Above all, the common belief was that Borg Olivier and his cabinet had no initiative, preferring to react rather than to act. In the 1971 election campaign, the Labour Party claimed that the government was lazy and out of touch, especially compared with the aggressive and determined Mintoff. However, the Borg Olivier Cabinet was incredibly active meeting, in all, 766 times from 27 August 1962 to 1 June 1971, just before the elections which were to unseat it; the cabinet met even on Boxing Day, sometimes morning and evening, and even on the feast day of St Paul's Shipwreck. This effort did Borg Olivier no good; Mintoff and Labour regained power. Having led the Nationalists to defeat in the 1971 election and also the next election five years later, Borg Olivier incurred increasing censure within as well as outside his own party. His approach seemed lightweight and passive compared with Mintoff's vehement rule. Borƒ° Olivier opposed, but without success, the growing tendency of Mintoff's most extreme supporters to resort to violence as a political weapon. Among Borg Olivier's fellow party members, a younger generation had emerged by this time which considered him physically and politically incapable of winning back popular support from Mintoff. His growing tendency to procrastinate rather than to take tough decisions attracted particular criticism. During January 1974, eighteen Nationalist parliamentarians signed a declaration of no confidence in Borƒ° Olivier's leadership. Three others who could not attend signed later. Out of 27 MPs, only five supported the party leader. These five MPs were Paulo Borg Olivier (George's brother), Albert Borg Olivier de Puget (George's nephew), Alfred Bonnici (who had been appointed speaker in the previous parliament by George), J. Cassar Galea (an old friend of Borƒ° Olivier) and Alexander Cachia Zammit (a former minister in Borg Olivier's cabinet).\\"Wikileaks: Borg Olivier faced no confidence declaration by party MPs,\\" The Malta Independent, 10 April 2013. Borg Olivier could still count on the support of his relatives in the party, as well as on those politicians who, like Cachia Zammit, had been members of his 1962-1971 cabinets and were still in the legislature. For a while, that backing was enough to enable Borg Olivier to retain the party leadership. Yet when Borg Olivier loyalists proved incapable of opposing Mintoff's proposal to change Malta from a constitutional monarchy to a republic (with a parliamentary majority of two-thirds, but without the referendum which Borg Olivier wanted), his position was fatally weakened. After Mintoff's re- election in 1976, the general feeling among most Nationalists was that the party could succeed only if it acquired a young, genuinely devout, dynamic Catholic as a new leader. In other words, the Nationalist Party wanted to adopt a populist approach. Ironically enough, it was a position which had been advocated by Ganado, but which Borg Olivier had strongly resisted in the sixties. Undercurrents began to form within the higher ranks of the party with the aim of removing Borg Olivier. Eddie Fenech Adami, a comparative newcomer among Nationalist parliamentarians, became the party's leader in 1977. At 44 years of age he was much younger and more determined than Borg Olivier. His tenure as Opposition Leader reinvigorated an ailing party, which achieved an actual majority of the popular vote in 1981. After stepping down from party leader, Borg Olivier became a recluse, alone, friendless and detached from the local political scene. A sense of betrayal marked his attitude, given that Fenech Adami had been encouraged by Borg Olivier to remain in politics after suffering two personal electoral defeats. Death and state-funeral Monument to George Borg Olivier in Valletta Despite his increasingly worsening health, Borƒ° Olivier still tried to remain active in public life. By 1980, Borg Olivier had been battling lung cancer for a number of years. Less than four years after he had resigned from the leadership of the Nationalist Party, he died at his Sliema home, at age 69, on Wednesday 29 October 1980. Prime Minister Mintoff expressed his intention to organise a state funeral for Borg Olivier. His funeral was the largest state funeral in Maltese history up to that point in time, and it was followed by thousands who went to Valletta to pay their last respects. He was buried at Addolorata cemetery, Paola, Malta. A monument in honour of Borƒ° Olivier was erected in Castille Square, Valletta in 1989, as part of the events commemorating the 25th anniversary of independence.

Taxonomy  The genus was redefined to include Cimicifuga and Souliea in the 1990s (Compton et al. 1998, Compton & Culham 2002, Gao et al. 2006, RHS Plant Finder, 2007) based on combined evidence from DNA sequence data, similarity in biochemical constituents and on morphology returning it to the original Linnean concept of the genus. The number of species in Actaea is to 25-30 using this concept. Other botanists (e.g., Hoffman 1999, Wang et al. 1999, Lee & Park 2004, Wang et al. 2009) reject this merger because only one group (Actaea) have fleshy fruit while the remainder have dry fruit. However, this narrower generic concept works for only a single morphological character and other characters such as number of carpels moves the generic boundary. The genus is treated here in its broader sense. The Plant List lists 30 species, and does not list Cimicifuga separately but treats it as a synonym. ; Selected species * Actaea arizonica - Arizona bugbane * Actaea asiatica * Actaea elata * Actaea matsumurae - Kamchatka bugbane, Japanese bugbane * Actaea pachypoda - white baneberry, white cohosh, doll's eyes * Actaea podocarpa * Actaea racemosa - black cohosh, black bugbane * Actaea rubra (syn.

Use and toxicity  White baneberry (Actaea pachypoda) in Canada Baneberry contains cardiogenic toxins that can have an immediate sedative effect on human cardiac muscle. The berries are the most poisonous part of the plant (hence the name baneberry). Children have been poisoned by eating the waxy, shiny red or white berries. Ingestion of the berries can lead to cardiac arrest and death. It is toxic to rabbits.Camilla Bergstr√∏m.

His Gang is alleged to have killed hundreds of people during the early days of the American Old West, in the years following the Civil War. However, these numbers are probably inaccurate, and the actual number is between fifty and sixty. Baker was notorious for fighting in saloon brawls and his fiery temper. During one fight, he was knocked unconscious by a man named Morgan Culp, who hit him in the head with a tomahawk. This seemed to have shocked him into behaving, and it calmed his temper at least for a while. Baker has also been described as an earlier version of a gunfighter, though his preferred weapon was actually a double-barrel shotgun. Early life Baker was born in Weakley County, Tennessee, a son of John Baker and his wife. Soon after that his family moved to Clarksville, Arkansas, and as Cullen Baker matured he spent much of his time in the saloons and bars in now Lafayette and Miller Counties. His father was an honest farmer, and owned cattle as well as working in the fields. Even when young Cullen Baker is said to have had a quick temper, which was revealed as he got older, as he drank heavily and often. On January 11, 1854 in Cass County, Texas Baker married Martha Jane Petty, and for a time he settled. Martha Jane Petty was the daughter of Hubbard and Nancy Petty. However, eight months into his marriage, while out drinking with friends, he became involved in a verbal altercation with a youth named Stallcup. Baker became enraged, grabbed a whip, and beat the boy to near death. There were several witnesses to the incident, and Baker was soon charged with the crime. One of the witnesses, Wesley Bailey, was confronted by Baker at Bailey's home. Baker shot him in both legs with a shotgun, then left him lying in front of his house. Bailey died a few days later. Before he could be arrested for the murder, Baker fled to Arkansas, where he stayed with an uncle. On May 24, 1857, Martha Jane Baker gave birth to a baby girl, Louisa Jane. On June 2, 1860, Martha Jane Baker died. Cullen Baker then returned to Texas, where he left his daughter with his in-laws. Baker returned to Arkansas, but word of his crimes had spread, and a local woman named Beth Warthom was openly critical of him. He took several hickory switches to her house, and threatened to beat her. Her husband, David Warthom, began to fight with Baker, and overwhelmed him in front of the house. Beth Warthom screamed, and her husband looked her way. With his attention drawn away from Baker, he was stabbed once with a knife Baker had in his possession. Warthom died on the spot. Baker fled back to Texas, and in July, 1862, he married his second wife Martha Foster, who was unaware that he was wanted for murder. She was a daughter of William and Elizabeth Young Foster. American Civil War and after Baker served with the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, joining shortly after his second marriage. It is claimed he shot and killed at least three African Americans, killing a black woman in an immigrant train and later shooting a black boy six times with a pistol after taking the Oath of Allegiance and becoming an overseer of Freemen.Memphis daily appeal., December 08, 1872, Image 2 By 1864 he had either been discharged or deserted, and he joined a group called the \\"Independent Rangers\\", loosely associated with the Confederate Home Guard. It was intended to pursue and capture deserters from the Confederate Army, but more often than not took advantage of most of the men being away at war, leaving mostly elderly men, women and children. This left the door open for acts of intimidation, rape, theft and violence for groups of well-armed men like the \\"Independent Rangers\\". Shortly after Baker joined the \\"Independent Rangers\\" they began an ongoing feud with another band called the \\"Mountain Boomers\\", but by the end of that year the \\"Boomers\\" had been driven out or forced to disperse due to several of their members having been killed by the \\"Rangers\\". In November, 1864 Baker led a group of \\"Rangers\\" to intercept a band of Arkansas settlers, mostly older men, women and children who had fled Perry County, Arkansas for a better life out West. Allegedly this was considered \\"un-patriotic\\" by Baker, but more likely than not is that he wished to rob them of their possessions. The \\"Rangers\\" caught up with these fleeing settlers as they were crossing the Saline River somewhere in the Ouachita Mountains, but when the settler band refused to return Baker drew his pistol and shot and killed the band's leader. With assurances from Baker that he would not kill anyone else, the remaining settlers returned to Baker's side of the river, where he quickly led his \\"Rangers\\" in shooting and killing nine other men. The event became known locally as the Massacre of Saline. By that stage of the war the Union Army occupied most of Arkansas, with several troops under the command of Captain F. S. Dodge enforcing the law in the area of Lafayette County. Most of these Union troops were African American, and despised by Baker. Toward the end of 1864 Baker was in a saloon in the small town of Spanish Bluffs, Arkansas when he was approached by four African American Union soldiers and asked for identification. Baker turned to face them with his pistol drawn, shooting and killing one sergeant and the three other soldiers. After the war he operated with a gang he organized with outlaw Lee Rames in the late 1860s, operating out of the Sulphur River bottoms near Bright Star, Arkansas, committing acts of robbery and murder. Authorities credit him officially with killing at least 30 people, though many of these no doubt were killed by his men. Unlike the romanticized versions of his exploits, the reality was that he killed most of them from ambush or in the back, and many with a shotgun, and he almost always had his victims outnumbered. Like many of the ex-Confederates who operated after the war, Baker was regarded as a hero by some because he opposed the Federal occupation, but his record shows a merciless killer who killed anyone who angered him, regardless of their loyalties. In March, 1866 he traveled back to Texas, Baker, now on the run from Union authorities, went on a killing spree, during which he killed two men, W.G. Kirkman and John Salmons. Salmons had previously killed one of Baker's gang members, Seth Rames, brother to gang member Lee Rames. He also killed a local man named George W. Barron, who had previously taken part as a member of a posse hunting Baker. The gang was active in the areas of Queen City, Texas and Texarkana, Arkansas during that time. On June 1, 1867, having returned to Cass County, Baker entered the Rowden general store where he found the store kept by Mrs. Rowden, after which he simply helped himself to whatever he wanted and left without paying. When the store's owner, John Rowden, discovered this he armed himself with a shotgun and rode out to Baker's house. He demanded that Baker pay him, to which Baker replied that he would come back to the store in a few days with the money. On June 5, 1867, Baker returned, but instead was standing in front of the store yelling for Mr. Rowden to come out and face him. Rowden armed himself with a shotgun and stepped out only to be shot in the chest and killed by Baker. Baker fled back into Arkansas, and a few days later he was confronted by a US Army sergeant and one private as Baker boarded a ferry. When he was accused of being Cullen Baker, after he'd told them his name was Johnson, Baker went for his gun as did the sergeant. Baker shot the sergeant four times, killing him, with the private fleeing on horseback and reporting the murder to a Captain Kirkham. Following his murder of this sergeant Baker was pursued relentlessly by US forces in the area and while in New Boston, Texas The South-western., August 07, 1867, Image 2 on July 25, 1867, he became involved in an argument with several US Army soldiers. A shootout ensued, and he was shot in the arm, with him killing army Private Albert E. Titus of the US 20th Infantry Regiment.Albert Titus at Find a grave This resulted in a $1,000 reward being placed on him for his capture or death. He returned to Arkansas, and while in a saloon in Bright Star he agreed to join a mob intending to raid the farm of a local farmer named Howell Smith. Smith had hired several recently-freed slaves, which was considered inappropriate by much of the local population. During the raid one of Smith's daughters was stabbed and another clubbed, and a black man was shot and killed. Smith resisted, and a shootout ensued resulting in several mob members being wounded, including Baker being shot in the leg. On October 24, 1868 Baker and his gang were reported to have been involved in the killings of Major P.J. Andrews, Lt. H.F. Willis, an unnamed negro and wounding of Sheriff Standel of Little Rock Arkansas.The Aftermath of the Civil War in Arkansas by Powell Clayton .p.100 1915 Memphis daily appeal., November 17, 1868, Image 1 reports only the killing of Andrews and Willis Downfall and assassination Although Baker was feared by his own men, Lee Rames, who was recognized as the co- leader and co-founder of Baker's gang, also had a substantial and deadly reputation. Rames began to doubt Baker's leadership, and that eventually Baker would lead to the downfall of the entire gang. Lee Rames defied Baker and Baker backed down, leading to the gang breaking up. All but one gang member, \\"Dummy\\" Kirby, sided with Rames. Baker and Kirby rode to Bloomburg, Texas and the house of Baker's in-laws in January 1869. It would be there that Cullen Baker and \\"Dummy\\" Kirby were killed. What exactly happened, however, has at least two versions; First version: Unknown to Baker, his wife Martha Foster's father and friends had laced a bottle of whiskey and some food with strychnine. Kirby and Baker drank and ate it, and both died from poisoning. Their bodies were then shot several times by Foster and some friends. Second version: A local school teacher named Thomas Orr had become involved romantically with Baker's second wife Martha, and led a small band of men who ambushed Baker and Kirby at the Foster home, shooting and killing him near to the chimney of the house, along with Kirby. It is known that a school teacher named Thomas Orr was one of the friends to the in-laws who took part in the killing of Baker. As to the affair, it is unknown. What both versions share is the end result. Baker and Kirby were killed, it did happen at the Foster home, both were shot numerous times, whether that was what killed them or it happened after they died from poisoning, then the bodies were dragged through the town of Bloomburg. The bodies were then taken to the US Army outpost near Jefferson, where they were placed on public display. He is buried in the Oakwood Cemetery in Jefferson, Texas. The town of Bloomburg, Texas continues to commemorate the event with the annual Cullen Baker Country Fair, held the first weekend in November. Proceeds benefit the Bloomburg Volunteer Fire Department. =Possible eye witness version to death= Reference to Cullen (Col) Baker is made by former slave Doc Quinn in the Slave Narratives: a Folk History of Slavery in the United States - From Interviews with Former Slaves - Arkansas Narratives, Part 6. Doc Quinn provides a somewhat different perspective on Cullen Baker throughout. The statements of Doc Quinn are recorded as follows: \\"He wuz mah frien' as long as he lib, and he wuz a good frien' ob de South 'cause he saved lots ob white folks frum de wrath ob de mean niggers.\\" (sic) . Doc Quinn provides an account of Cullen Baker's death at which he claims to have been present. \\"I saw Colonel Baker killed. We had just arrived at his father-in-law's house and I wuz in the horse lot, about 50 yards from de house, when Joe Davis. Thomas Orr and some more men rode up.\\" \\"De Colonel wuz standin' by de chimney an did not see dem come aroun' de house. Dey killed him befo' he knew dey wuz aroun'.\\" Whilst Doc Quinn refers to Cullen Baker as Colonel Baker, the text from which Doc Quinn is quoted has the following inclusion, presumably included by the editor of the publication to clarify any confusion: \\"Note: The Col. Baker referred to was Cullen Baker, the leader of a ruthless gang of bushwhackers that operated in this (Texarkana, Arkansas) section shortly after the Civil War.\\" Louis L'amour, author of many western novels, wrote about Cullen Baker in several of his books. Baker only starred in one of these, however, that being The First Fast Draw, a highly fictional account of Baker's origin and subsequent years. Other books by L'amour that reference Baker include Lando, one of L'amour's many novels about a feuding Tennessee family. Baker was also the subject of the book Cullen Baker; Reconstruction Desperado, authored by Barry A. Crouch and Donally E. Brice.  References  The First Fast Draw, by Louis L'Amour.

A stamp of the Orange Free State overprinted V.R.I. in 1900 during the British occupation. The Orange Free State was an independent Boer republic in southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century. The Orange Free State was annexed to the British Crown and renamed the Orange River Colony on 28 May 1900. In 1910 this colony along with Cape of Good Hope, Natal and Transvaal formed the Union of South Africa.  Postage stamps The first Orange Free State stamps were issued in 1868. The sole design used was an orange tree, with the inscription \\"Oranje Vrij Staat\\" in the margin. The stamps were typographed by De La Rue and Company, and came in denominations from one penny to five shillings, in various colours. Periodic shortages forced the use of overprints, in 1877, 1881, 1882, 1888, 1890, 1892, 1896, and 1897. The stamps of the republic are generally common today, but some of the overprints are scarce. Many kinds of overprint errors are known (inverted, double, etc.), and some of them command high prices. In 1900, the British occupied the Republic and the previous stamps were overprinted \\"V.R.I.\\" (Victoria Regina Imperatrix, Latin for Victoria, Queen and Empress) and the same value of the original stamps. The colony was renamed in August 1900 and used Cape of Good Hope stamps overprinted with the new name \\"ORANGE/RIVER/COLONY.\\" In 1902 a single 6d stamp was overprinted as the original occupation issues but with \\"E.R.I.\\" (Edward Rex Imperator, for Edward VII) instead of \\"V.R.I.\\". In 1903 a set was issued portraying King Edward VII, a springbok and a gnu.

He is credited with laying the foundation for the acceptance by mainstream America of \\"alternative\\" lifestyles such as yoga and health food. His books Barefeet and Good Things to Eat and the memoir The Gypsy in MeOriginal ‚ÄòNature Boy‚Äô Gypsy Boots Remembered gained him a cult following. Life and career Bootzin was born in San Francisco, California, to Russian Jewish immigrants. His father, Max, worked as a broom salesman. His mother, Mushka, raised Bootzin and his four siblings in a vegetarian household, while also leading the family on hikes in the hills, performing Russian folk dances and feeding the homeless with her home-baked black bread. Bootzin's older brother, John, died of tuberculosis as a young man; this led to Bootzin's decision to grow his hair long and pursue healthful, natural living.Elaine Woo, Gypsy Boots, 89; Colorful Promoter of Healthy Food and Lifestyles, Los Angeles Times, August 10, 2004, Accessed December 22, 2008. By 1933, he had dropped out of high school and left home to wander California with a group of self-styled vagabonds. In the 1940s, Bootzin, along with 10-15 other \\"tribesmen,\\" lived off the land in Tahquitz Canyon near Palm Springs, slept in caves and trees, and bathed in waterfalls. Decades ahead of the Hippie movement, Bootzin and his companions had long hair and beards, lived a carefree existence, and were seasonal fruit pickers. The group became known as \\"Nature Boys.\\" A combination of the philosophy of the Nature Boys and growing counterculture of the 1950s and 1960s in California may have been responsible for the emergence of California spirituality in the 1960s.Gordon Kennedy: Children of the Sun: A Pictorial Anthology From Germany To California 1883‚Äì1949. Nivaria Press (1998), 192 pp., The 1948 Nat King Cole hit \\"Nature Boy\\" was inspired by Bootzin and his fellow \\"tribesmen\\" and was composed by eden ahbez. In 1958, Bootzin married Lois Bloemker, a conservative, academic woman from Fort Wayne, Indiana, and settled in the Los Feliz - East Hollywood area (Cumberland Ave). They had three children: Daniel, Alex and Freddie (who died in 2001). The two divorced in the late 1990s. His health food store \\"Health Hut\\" was one of the first of its kind (if not the first) in the world and was patronized by dozens of Hollywood celebrities in the early 1960s. The original Health Hut, located on Beverly Blvd just west of La Cienega Blvd, had an authentic \\"tiki\\" style to it, being made with leaves and bamboo.David Ferrell. Gypsy at 75, \`Nature Boy' Is a Free Spirit With a Healthy Sense of Humor. Los Angeles Times - April 20, 1986 Bootzin personally advocated never eating meat, drinking alcohol, or smoking tobacco. He was an early believer in the health properties of organic foods. One of these organic foods was garlic--and he later became a spokesperson for the \\"Kyolic\\" variety. He also did work for a Sonoma cheese factory. He would often have a garlic-spiced cheese, \\"Sonoma Jack,\\" at his booth at health festivals and fairs in Sonoma Valley,\\" along with his all- natural, sugar-free \\"Boots Bars,\\" wheat grass, spirulina, and kyolic garlic, as well as \\"honey-sweet\\" Medjool dates from his grove. His childhood vegetarian lifestyle was something Bootzin continued with his own family, as his son Daniel Bootzin corroborated. Bootzin died in Camarillo, California, just 11 days short of his 90th birthday. He was survived by his former wife, Lois Bootzin, a Lutheran,Legacy: \\"Lois Bootzin (1924-2014) Obituary\\" February 18, 2014 two of his sons (Daniel and Alexander), three grandchildren, and a sister. His son Freddy died in 2001. Appearances Bootzin received national exposure in 1955 when he appeared as a contestant on Groucho Marx's network TV show You Bet Your Life (September 30, 1955 Season 5 Episode 3). Introduced as \\"Boots Bootzin,\\" he cheerfully espoused his philosophy of clean living, exercise, and healthy eating. Even though he was over 40, he acted like a gangly, goofy, but polite teenager, causing mildly sensational reactions from the audience. When asked by Groucho to demonstrate how he sold figs, he stepped toward the edge of the stage, shouted an attention-getting sales pitch for a few seconds, and then performed a perfect pratfall (the type where one falls sideways after swinging one leg to knock the other one out from underneath). In the game portion of the show, he correctly whispered the spelling of the word \\"motif\\" to his partner, who overruled him and miscorrected it to \\"motiffe\\". Groucho, who usually displayed little tolerance for extremists, admired Bootzin's rugged individualism and said so, on camera. He also seemed to appreciate the perfect execution of one of vaudeville's classic bits.\\"You Bet Your Life\\", Episode #5.30, 1955 His wife appeared on the same programme a few years later with a man who worked as an organ grinder with 13 children who had a monkey that looked and walked like Groucho. She appeared very conservative and polite and nothing like her former husband's appearance, who was as described above. She recalled how she met him while she practiced her ballet on a beach. Bootzin was standing on his head. She found his antics interesting enough to approach him, and the relationship developed from there. Her connection with him was not mentioned on the show and, perhaps because of the organ grinder, may have been overlooked due to time and Groucho's interest in the monkey act. Bootzin made personal appearances with the Spike Jones musical-comedy troupe, speaking about health foods. He was a regular guest on American television talk shows in the 1960s, appearing 25 times on The Steve Allen Show. On the Allen show he would often play up his role as a health advocate by swinging from a vine on stage as a \\"Nature Boy\\", and persuade Steve to drink one of \\"Gypsy Boots\\" concocted fruit health drinks. He referred to this drink as a \\"smoothie\\", giving credence to Gypsy Boots as one of the originators of the popular style of blended natural fruit health drinks. He also made frequent appearances on George Putnam's Talk Back, which came at the tail end of the popular KTLA George Putnam News in Los Angeles, California. He released a record album, Unpredictable, on Sidewalk Records in 1968. Gypsy loved to participate in parades, including the annual, wildly creative and noncommercial Santa Barbara Summer Solstice Parade. Boots appeared at the Annual Calabasas Pumpkin Festival in 1973. Even in his late 80s he would energetically dance, make music, and holler all the way up the parade route for a couple of miles. He would show up for weekly farmers' markets in his wildly painted van promoting kyolic garlic, and would always be a showman with the gift of gab, giving out free garlic samples. Gypsy also participated in several Fourth of July parades in the town of Sonoma, California, in the late 1990s and/or early 2000s, throwing a football to a fellow participant. Bootzin was an avid fan of the USC Trojans football team and was known for eccentric clothes and an ever-present cowbell. He also regularly attended Los Angeles Dodgers, Lakers and Raiders games with spirited cheers, noisemakers and streamers. At age 86, he was still able to throw an American football at least 40 yards. In movies, Bootzin appears sitting in the diner scene in Michael Douglas's film The Game. Other movie appearances include Mondo Hollywood, A Swingin' Summer, and Confessions of Tom Harris, and he can be seen quite frequently at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. Gypsy also appeared as a guest MC at the Newport Pop Festival in August 1968. The Newport Pop was the first festival to draw over 100,000 in attendance. Gypsy also helped with the promotion of the two-day event at the Orange County Fairgrounds. Gypsy enjoyed mingling with the performers, including Sonny and Cher, The Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead, Tiny Tim, Eric Burdon and the Animals, Canned Heat, and a dozen other great acts of the day. Bootzin's son, Dan, appeared on Dan Harmon's \\"Harmontown\\" podcast with his wife Beth, discussing the status of their beloved eucalyptus trees. Bootzin was warmly remembered by Billy Saluga (the \\"You can call me Ray\\" guy) on the December 11, 2017, episode of Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast.

Early mail sent to and from the Caroline Islands was occasional and dependent on visiting ships. German control German stamp overprinted Karolinen, 1900. The Spanish authorities issued no postage stamps or postmarks for the islands. Germany rapidly set up a postal system once awarded the islands; having received the Carolines on 1 June 1899 as part of the German-Spanish Treaty (1899), on 12 October German stamps overprinted \\"Karolinen\\" were issued. At first, the overprint was angled at 48 degrees, then a few months later the angle of the text was changed to 56 degrees. Few examples of these, at either angle, survive today, especially in cancelled condition. By 1900, Yap and Ponape were stops on a regular mail run between German New Guinea and Hong Kong. Initially, the service was operated by the Reich Mail Steamer Lines, with the help of government subsidies, then in 1902 the Jaluit Company took over. Yacht stamps Bisected 10pf stamp. A surcharged 5pf stamp. In January 1901, Germany issued its Yacht stamps with a common design for all of Germany's colonies, featuring the Kaiser's yacht Hohenzollern. The issues for the Carolines featured the inscription \\"KAROLINEN\\", all with mark and pfennig denominations. Many unused copies of the low values still exist today, left over after the Japanese occupation, but as one might expect from the short period of German rule and the very small numbers of letter-writers living in the Carolines, genuinely used stamps are uncommon, typically priced 5-20 times higher than unused. In 1905 the stock of 5pf stamps was destroyed in a typhoon, and 10pf stamps were bisected. Another shortage in 1910 resulted in bisects of 20pf stamps, and 3pf stamps surcharged to 5pf. Japanese occupation Japan occupied the islands in October 1914, after which Japanese stamps were used until the end of World War II. Germany printed Yacht stamps for the Carolines as late as 1919, on paper with lozenge watermarks, but none were ever used on mail. The islands became part of the U.S. Trust Territory of the Pacific in 1944 and used U.S. stamps until 1983.

First stamps The first postage stamps of Tanganyika were stamps of the East Africa and Uganda Protectorates overprinted \\"G.E.A.\\" (for German East Africa), used in 1921 and 1922. These are superficially identical to the last occupation issues of German East Africa, but the presence of the \\"Crown and Script CA\\" watermark shows they were issued after the civil administration took over from the military, and are thus properly considered the first issues of Tanganyika. Later issues In 1922, the government issued a series of 19 stamps inscribed \\"TANGANYIKA\\", featuring the head of a giraffe, denominated in cents, shillings and pounds (100 cents to a shilling, 20 shillings to a pound), with several colour changes in 1925. The changes were because there were many power changes, with each leader wanting a different color. This was followed in 1927 by a second series of 16 values in a more conventional design with a profile of King George V and inscribed \\"MANDATED TERRITORY OF TANGANYIKA\\". In 1927, Tanganyika entered the Customs Union of Kenya and Uganda, as well as the East African Postal Union. Between 1935 and 1963, stamps of the combined postal administration (East African Posts and Telecommunications Administration) inscribed \\"Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika\\" were in use. Independence Shortly after independence in 1961, the new state of Tanganyika issued a series of commemorative stamps inscribed \\"TANGANYIKA\\". This was followed by a final commemorative issue on December 9, 1962, with four stamps inscribed \\"JAMHURI YA TANGANYIKA\\" (\\"Republic of Tanganyika\\") to commemorate the founding of the republic. Tanganyika ceased to exist as a nation in 1964, when it was loosely united with Zanzibar, to form the nation of Tanzania.

Background Amata Kabua was a scion of Marshallese Royalty. Amata Kabua is the son of high chiefess Tarjikit of the Eastern (Ratak chain) and rumoured to be a Japanese administrator by his political opponents. This was disputed by his father Lejolan Kabua. However, by Marshallese custom of \\"kujen loje\\" (nobleman of birth) High Chief Lojela√± of the Ralik (Western) chain claimed Amata as his own in the same manner Loeak the Great adopted Lajore and Litilinej, probably because Laelan of Arno who is Dorothy Kabua's father was Kabua's biological child however under \\"kujen loje\\" Laelan of Arno was adopted by Takto just as Laelan Kabua of the Erroja clan was adopted by Kabua (Lebon) under the same tradition as was Leit who was claimed by Iroij Bwio Jiba. Ironically, the \\"kujen loe\\" concept applied to Albert Loeak who was not the biological son of Lobokkij Loeak despite what many are led to believe as it also applied to Imata Kabua, Manini Kabua, Anjojo Kabua, Mike Kabua, Kabua Kabua, Laelan Kabua, Anjua Loeak, etc but however given Amata's political visibility, he is more referenced, it is possible that racism is to blame as is political jealousy which is common in Marshallese politics. Amata's father Chief (Iroij) Lejola√± Kabua was the son of Paramount Chief Iroij Bwio Jeimata Kabua of Northern Ralik (Western) Chain. Jeimata Kabua was the son of King Kabua the Great (nicknamed King John) with Leroij Bwio LiWodin..Kabua is also known as King John, who, on behalf of his father Iroij Bwio Jiba, led diplomatic relations between Germany and the Marshall Islands in 1885 through the Treaty of Friendship. Amata Kabua's mother, Leroij Dorothy Tarjikit, was a paramount chieftain of Majuro with royal connections to the Rimwejoor and Raano clans who ruled the entire Ratak (eastern) chain but later lost Mejit. Tarjikit was regarded as a pure-blooded royal in equal rank to Jeimata Kabua and his father Kabua the great because of her Bwio status. Tarjikit's father was a paramount chieftain named Laela√± of the Rimwejoor Clan in Arno and her mother was Leroij Bwio Maria of the Raano Clan of Majuro. Tarjikit's father High Chief Laela√± of the Ratak/Eastern chain is not to be confused with Bwirak Laela√± from the Erroja clan who was the stepson of Kabua the Great as liBwirak Neimekua was already pregnant with son Laelan Kabua when entering the Kabua household. The rule of incest was prevalent within this family and it was a key marriage alliance structure that allowed continued dominance through familial loyalties under the plain basis of existential circumstance. Jeimata's parents Leroij Pwieo Worin and Iroij Bwio Kabua were first cousins as were Tarjikit's parents Laela√± and Maria. And by extension, Tarjikit and Lejolan were first cousins also. While Kabua the Great welcomed the Protestant missionaries safely on Ebon by offering his protection in 1850s under the guidance of his uncle Kaibuke thereby solidifying a royal connection to the Protestant faith, Tarjikit helped found the Catholic church in the Capital of the Marshall Islands thereby solidifying a royal connection to the Catholic faith. Tarjikit was also the first indigenous Micronesian of the Trust Territory ever to attend a United Nations Trusteeship Council meeting in 1953 with her son Amata as interpreter. While Amata's mother became the first indigenous Micronesian to visit the United Nations, his father Lejola√± was the first Marshallese to visit the White House when he met with President Lyndon B. Johnson. Career Amata began his career as a school teacher then as a Superintendent to Schools along with Chief Clerk for the Council of Iroij in the 1950s. He was elected to the Council of Micronesia as a Representative and later as Senator to the Congress of Micronesia in 1963 where he also served one term as president for the Congress of Micronesia. Amata Kabua was the first president of the Marshall Islands in 1979 when its first constitution was implemented. After his older brother Joba Kabua died in 1982, Amata Kabua inherited the Iroijlaplap title for Majuro Atoll in the domain of Kaibuke Tobinwa and certain parts of the Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands in the domain of Jeimata Kabua. He later became the first president of the Marshall Islands when the nation received full independence in free association with the United States through the compact. He had been a principal participant in the negotiations to gain independence for the Marshall Islands and is regarded as the founding father of the modern nation by Marshallese. He wrote the words and music for the national anthem, \\"Forever Marshall Islands\\". Amata Kabua was the son of a paramount chief of the Ralik Chain and a paramount chieftain of the Ratak Chain. He died in office after a long illness, on December 20, 1996, in Hawaii. He chose to be buried in his family property in Long Island going against royal burial traditions of Ralik & Ratak Chains as his Ralik family wanted him to be buried in the royal cemetery in Bouj, Ailinglaplap while his Majuro Kin wanted him to be buried in the royal cemetery in Laura. He chose to be buried in his family property in Long Island so his wife Emlain Kabua who is a commoner of the Ijidrik clan can be buried next to him because as a commoner, she will never be allowed to be buried in the royal cemetery in Laura however her great grandmother Limurelok (Kabua's wife) was buried in Bouj, Ailinglaplap in the Kabua cemetery. (Amata's older brother Joba Kabua also permitted his wife Jauni to be buried in the royal cemetery in Laura. However, due to certain restrictions, Jauni was not allowed her own space and thus shared the same burial spot with Joba Kabua having been buried on top of each other).

Like the earlier Dalton Gang alone, it specialized in robbing banks, trains, and stagecoaches in Arkansas, Kansas, and Indian and Oklahoma during the 1890s. Early life Doolin was born in 1858 in Johnson County, Arkansas to Michael Doolin and the former Artemina Beller. Doolin left home in 1881 to become a cowboy in Indian Territory, where he worked for cattleman Oscar Halsell, a Texas native. During this time, Doolin worked with other cowboy and outlaw names of the day, including George Newcomb (known as \\"Bitter Creek\\"), Charley Pierce, Bill Power, Dick Broadwell, Bill \\"Tulsa Jack\\" Blake, Dan \\"Dynamite Dick\\" Clifton, and the better-known Emmett Dalton. Doolin's first encounter with the law came on July 4, 1891, in Coffeyville in southeastern Kansas. Doolin and some friends were drunk in public, and lawmen attempted to confiscate their alcohol. A shootout ensued, and two of the lawmen were wounded. Doolin escaped capture by fleeing.  Dalton Gang  Shortly thereafter, Doolin became a member of the Dalton Gang. On October 5, 1892, the Dalton Gang tried to rob two banks simultaneously in Coffeyville. It was an utter failure. Coffeyville residents and lawmen rallied in a shootout against the outlaws, resulting in four of the five gang members being killed. Emmett Dalton was captured and convicted at trial, and imprisoned. Historians have since indicated that a sixth gang member was in town, holding the horses in an alley, and escaped. The sixth man has never been identified. There is speculation that it may have been Bill Doolin.  Wild Bunch  In late 1892, Doolin formed his own gang, the Wild Bunch. On November 1, 1892, the gang robbed a bank in Spearville, Kansas. After the robbery, the gang fled with gang member Oliver Yantis to Oklahoma Territory, where they hid out at the house of Yantis's sister. Less than one month later, the gang was tracked to that location. In a shootout Yantis was killed, but the rest of the gang escaped. Two teenaged girls, known as Little Britches and Cattle Annie, also followed the gang as bandits. They warned the men whenever law-enforcement officers were in pursuit. Sources indicate that Doolin gave bandit Jennie Stevens her nickname of Little Britches. Following the Spearville robbery, the gang embarked on a spree of successful bank and train robberies. In March 1893, Doolin married Edith Ellsworth in Ingalls, Oklahoma. Shortly thereafter, Doolin and his gang robbed a train near Cimarron, Kansas. During a shootout with lawmen, Doolin was shot and seriously wounded in the foot. He retreated to Ingalls. On September 1, 1893, fourteen deputy U.S. marshals entered Ingalls to apprehend the gang. The armed confrontation became known as the Battle of Ingalls. During the shootout, three marshals were killed, two bystanders were killed and one wounded, three of the gang members were wounded, and gang member \\"Arkansas Tom Jones\\" was wounded and captured. Doolin shot and killed Deputy Marshal Richard Speed during that shootout. For a time the Wild Bunch was the most powerful outlaw group in the Old West. Because of the relentless pursuit by the US deputy marshals known as the Three Guardsmen (lawmen Bill Tilghman, Chris Madsen, and Heck Thomas), by the end of 1894 they had either captured or killed many of the gang. In late 1894, gang member Bill Dalton was killed by U.S. marshals. Rewards were offered for the capture or death of remaining gang members, a lure that sometimes turned friends into foes to collect the money. On May 1, 1895, gang members Charlie Pierce and George \\"Bittercreek\\" Newcomb were shot and killed by bounty hunters known as the Dunn Brothers. They were the older brothers of Rose Dunn, the teenage girlfriend of Newcomb. It was alleged that she had betrayed Newcomb, but her brothers may have trailed her to the outlaws' hideout. Doolin fled to New Mexico Territory, where he hid with outlaw Richard \\"Little Dick\\" West during the summer of 1895. In late 1895, Doolin and his wife hid out near Burden, Kansas. They went over the border to visit the resort community of Eureka Springs in northwestern Arkansas. There Doolin soaked in the sulphur springs in the bathhouses; the waters relieved the rheumatism in his foot that set in after an earlier gunshot. In early 1896, Doolin was captured in a bathhouse by deputy marshal Bill Tilghman. Posthumous photograph of Bill Doolin Doolin escaped from jail on July 5 and took refuge with his wife in Lawson in the Oklahoma Territory. There, on August 24, Doolin was killed by a shotgun blast in a confrontation with Deputy U.S. Marshal Heck Thomas. Bill Doolin is buried next to the outlaw Elmer McCurdy, in the Boot Hill section of Summit View Cemetery in Guthrie, Oklahoma. By the end of 1898, all of the remaining former Wild Bunch gang were dead, having been killed in various shootouts with lawmen. Heck Thomas had tracked most of them; the remainder were tracked down and eliminated by lawmen Madsen and Tilghman, or other posses.Matt Braun, Outlaw Kingdom: Bill Tilghman Was The Man Who Tamed Dodge City, 1995  Representation in other media  * Burt Lancaster portrayed Doolin in the film Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981).

Britain had interests in this area as early as 1824. Missionaries are known to have settled in the area in 1844. The Imperial British East Africa Company obtained a concession in 1887 to administer this area, from Sultan Bargash of the Sultanate of Zanzibar. The company started to experience financial difficulties in 1891. The situation was made more difficult in 1892 when Britain declared the Sultanate of Zanzibar part of the Congo Free Trade Zone and thus depriving the company of import duties.History of Kenya On 1 July 1895, the British government took over the administration of this area when the company was facing bankruptcy.  Pre-stamp era  The early missionaries in British East Africa sent letters by runner to forwarding agents in Zanzibar. Letters are known from as early as 1848. From 1875 mail was sent via the Indian post office which had been opened in Zanzibar.  Imperial British East Africa Company administration  A Sun and Crown stamp of 1890 The Imperial British East Africa Company was the first company holding a Royal Charter allowing operation of a postal system, for both local and international mail, to use their company name on their stamps. They were also the first to create a series of surcharged stamps with authorizing initials. Both of these led to the adoption of these practices by other countries such as the British South Africa Company and the Mozambique Company in 1892 and the surcharged Uganda typewritten stamps in 1895.Minns, John; Krieger, George, Ed.; British East Africa - The Stamps, Postal Stationery and Cancellations, Private Publication of 650, 2006.

During an acute shortage of stamps in August and September, 1890 stamps of India were used and are known postmarked 'MOMBASA' or 'LAMU'. It is alleged that an agent of stamp dealer Whitfield King bought up all the stocks in the post offices.Great Britain Overprint Society The British East Africa Company issued stamps, on 14 October 1890, using a symbolic sun and crown design and inscribed 'IMPERIAL BRITISH EAST AFRICA COMPANY', all valued in annas and rupees. Shortages, of some values, between 1891 and 1895 resulted in a variety of surcharges being produced.  British administration  On 9 July 1895 stamps of Imperial British East Africa Company were overprinted reading 'BRITISH / EAST / AFRICA' and overprints of 'British / East / Africa' on stamps of India were also issued. The protectorate joined the Universal Postal Union at this time. In 1896 a series of stamps depicting Queen Victoria was issued, inscribed 'BRITISH EAST AFRICA', these ran short in 1897 and stamps of Zanzibar were overprinted as the stamps of India had been previously. A number of additional post offices were opened along the Uganda Railway, which was started in 1896 at Mombasa and reached Kisumu on Lake Victoria in 1902. In 1901 the postal administration was merged with that of Uganda, and in 1904 stamps issued for the combined East Africa and Uganda Protectorates came into use.https://web.archive.org/web/20180720210224/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/africa/british-east-africa/ Retrieved 12 August 2018.

After finishing high school, we studied in the Netherlands at the Teachers' Training College in Hilversum, and received his headmasters certificate in 1959. Croes was the leader of the political party People's Electoral Movement (Movimiento Electoral di Pueblo) and in 1976 was the person responsible for the Seal, Flag and Hymn of the island of Aruba. The hymn was co-written by renowned Padu Del Caribe (Padu Lampe), and Rufo Wever, who also composed the anthem.

The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling. The algorithm mainly encodes consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is the first letter. Soundex is the most widely known of all phonetic algorithms (in part because it is a standard feature of popular database software such as DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Ingres, MS SQL Server and Oracle.) Improvements to Soundex are the basis for many modern phonetic algorithms. History Soundex was developed by Robert C. Russell and Margaret King Odell and patented in 1918 (Archived) and 1922. (Archived) A variation, American Soundex, was used in the 1930s for a retrospective analysis of the US censuses from 1890 through 1920. The Soundex code came to prominence in the 1960s when it was the subject of several articles in the Communications and Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, and especially when described in Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) maintains the current rule set for the official implementation of Soundex used by the U.S. government. These encoding rules are available from NARA, upon request, in the form of General Information Leaflet 55, \\"Using the Census Soundex\\". American Soundex The Soundex code for a name consists of a letter followed by three numerical digits: the letter is the first letter of the name, and the digits encode the remaining consonants. Consonants at a similar place of articulation share the same digit so, for example, the labial consonants B, F, P, and V are each encoded as the number 1. The correct value can be found as follows: #Retain the first letter of the name and drop all other occurrences of a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w. # Replace consonants with digits as follows (after the first letter): #* b, f, p, v ‚Üí 1 #* c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z ‚Üí 2 #* d, t ‚Üí 3 #* l ‚Üí 4 #* m, n ‚Üí 5 #* r ‚Üí 6 # If two or more letters with the same number are adjacent in the original name (before step 1), only retain the first letter; also two letters with the same number separated by 'h' or 'w' are coded as a single number, whereas such letters separated by a vowel are coded twice. This rule also applies to the first letter. # If you have too few letters in your word that you can't assign three numbers, append with zeros until there are three numbers. If you have four or more numbers, retain only the first three. Using this algorithm, both \\"Robert\\" and \\"Rupert\\" return the same string \\"R163\\" while \\"Rubin\\" yields \\"R150\\". \\"Ashcraft\\" and \\"Ashcroft\\" both yield \\"A261\\". \\"Tymczak\\" yields \\"T522\\" not \\"T520\\" (the chars 'z' and 'k' in the name are coded as 2 twice since a vowel lies in between them). \\"Pfister\\" yields \\"P236\\" not \\"P123\\" (the first two letters have the same number and are coded once as 'P'), and \\"Honeyman\\" yields \\"H555\\". The following algorithm is followed by most SQL languages (excluding PostgreSQL): # Save the first letter. Map all occurrences of a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w. to zero(0) # Replace all consonants (include the first letter) with digits as in [2.] above. # Replace all adjacent same digits with one digit, and then remove all the zero (0) digits # If the saved letter's digit is the same as the resulting first digit, remove the digit (keep the letter). # Append 3 zeros if result contains less than 3 digits. Remove all except first letter and 3 digits after it (This step same as [4.] in explanation above). The two algorithms above do not return the same results in all cases primarily because of the difference between when the vowels are removed. The first algorithm is used by most programming languages and the second is used by SQL. As examples, both \\"Robert\\" and \\"Rupert\\" yield \\"R163\\", while \\"Tymczak\\" yields \\"T520\\" and \\"Honeyman\\" yields \\"H555\\". In designing an application, which combines SQL and a programming language, the architect must decide whether to do all of the Soundex encoding in the SQL server or all in the programming language. The MySQL implementation can return more than 4 characters.CodingForums.com () Variants A similar algorithm called \\"Reverse Soundex\\" prefixes the last letter of the name instead of the first. The New York State Identification and Intelligence System (NYSIIS) algorithm was introduced in 1970 as an improvement to the Soundex algorithm. NYSIIS handles some multi-character n-grams and maintains relative vowel positioning, whereas Soundex does not. Daitch‚ÄìMokotoff Soundex (D‚ÄìM Soundex) was developed in 1985 by genealogist Gary Mokotoff and later improved by genealogist Randy Daitch because of problems they encountered while trying to apply the Russell Soundex to Jews with Germanic or Slavic surnames (such as Moskowitz vs. Moskovitz or Levine vs. Lewin). D‚ÄìM Soundex is sometimes referred to as \\"Jewish Soundex\\" or \\"Eastern European Soundex\\", although the authors discourage the use of those names. The D‚ÄìM Soundex algorithm can return as many as 32 individual phonetic encodings for a single name. Results of D-M Soundex are returned in an all-numeric format between 100000 and 999999. This algorithm is much more complex than Russell Soundex. As a response to deficiencies in the Soundex algorithm, Lawrence Philips developed the Metaphone algorithm in 1990. Philips developed an improvement to Metaphone in 2000, which he called Double Metaphone. Double Metaphone includes a much larger encoding rule set than its predecessor, handles a subset of non-Latin characters, and returns a primary and a secondary encoding to account for different pronunciations of a single word in English. Philips created Metaphone 3 as a further revision in 2009 to provide a professional version that provides a much higher percentage of correct encodings for English words, non-English words familiar to Americans, and first and last names found in the United States. It also provides settings that allow more exact consonant and internal vowel matching to allow the programmer to focus the precision of matches more closely.

Starr was tried for the murder of Deputy U.S. Marshal Floyd Wilson in 1893. Twice sentenced by Judge Isaac Parker to hang for murder, following a series of appeals and Starr's confrontation with Cherokee Bill, who was attempting a prison break, his sentence was reduced to a sentence of imprisonment for manslaughter. Starr was eventually granted a Presidential pardon and released. Starr went on to form a notorious gang that terrorized and robbed throughout northwest Arkansas around the start of the 20th century. He was imprisoned again in 1915, wrote his memoirs and, released on parole, even portrayed himself in the silent film, A Debtor to the Law (1919). While attempting to rob a bank in Harrison, Arkansas, in 1921, he was shot by the bank president W. J. Myers with a .38 caliber rifle, and later died of his wounds.

It has a Holarctic distribution occurring at low altitudes at high latitudes and at high altitudes in the south of its range, preferring damp shady situations. Description Adoxa moschatellina is a plant which forms carpets with a delicate appearance and it has rhizomes. It has thin, erect unbranched stems which end in clusters of five green flowers which are across. These flowers give the species one of its common names, \\"Town Hall Clock\\" as they face out in four directions at 90 degrees to each other, resembling the four faces of a town clock. The flowers have five petals and five stamens, but the stamens are divided into two parts creating the impression that there are ten stamens. When it is not in flower it can be hard to tell A. moschatellina from other plants with similar foliage. The plant and its flowers have a musk-like scent, which it emits towards evening when the dew falls. If the plant is bruised this scent disappears. Distribution Adoxa moschatellina has a boreal, circumpolar distribution in Europe, Asia and North America. It is widespread and common in most parts of the British Isles but becomes scarce in the north and west of Scotland and parts of eastern England. it is absent from Ireland. Its distribution in parts of Wales is localised, occurring only at sites where are base rich soil, such as Coed Dolgarrog National Nature Reserve in Conwy. Habitat and ecology Adoxa moschatellina is a perennial rhizome bearing herb of humid brown soils under shade on the banks of rivers and streams, in deciduous woodlands and under hedgerows. It does infrequently grow in shaded base-rich localities in uplands. This is a spring flowering species and it dies back after flowering in May or June in low-lying areas. The flowers are self-fertile and this species may reproduce by producing seeds or by vegetative spread. In Britain its altitude ranges from on Ben Lawers. The rather plain flowers of A. moschatellina are pollinated by flies and nocturnal moths which do not rely on colour to pollinate plants. It is parasitized by the rare smut Melanotaenium adoxae.

To accommodate the different monetary systems in use by the various states, it issued a series valued in groschen for the Northern District, and another using kreuzer for the Southern District, distinguishing them by framing the value number in a circle for the groschen stamps, and in an oval for the kreuzers. All of these stamps were inscribed \\"NORDDEUTSCHER POSTBEZIRK\\". In addition, there was a special quarter-schilling stamp for Hamburg, with the additional inscription \\"STADTPOSTBRIEF HAMBURG\\". Early in 1869 the stamps were issued with perforations, the previous issues having been rouletted.

The town was probably founded by the Banu Arous tribe, who gave it the name Araich Beni Arous. History A view of the port of Larache around 1670. In 1471, the Portuguese settlers from Asilah and Tangier drove the inhabitants out of Larache, and again it remained uninhabited until the Saadi Sultan Mohammed ash-Sheikh decided to repopulate it and build a stronghold on the plateau above river Loukos. He constructed a fortress at the entrance to the port as a means of controlling access to the river. In the 15th century superpower due to their marine expenditures Portugal spoke of Larache as the largest Port. For a long time, attempts by the Portuguese, Spanish and French to take it met with no success. The Portuguese established the nearby Graciosa fortress in 1489. The Kasbah, which was built in 1491 by Moulay en Nasser, later became a pirate stronghold. In 1610, the town passed to the Spanish, who stayed there until 1689, but who mainly used the ports as trading stops and never really administered the town. Moulay Ismail finally conquered Larache in 1689 . Attacks on Larache continued, but it still remained in Muslim hands. In 1765, a French fleet failed in the Larache expedition. In 1829, the Austrians punitively bombarded the city due to Moroccan piracy. Due to the colonisation era Spain took Larache in 1911 and held it for 45 years until 1956. The ruins of Lixus Lixus Lixus is the site of an ancient city located in Morocco just north of the modern seaport of Larache on the bank of the Loukkos River. It was built by a Berber king in 1180 BC. Lixus was one of the Kingdom of Mauretania's ancient cities. It was settled by the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC. Lixus was part of a chain of Phoenician/Carthaginian settlements; other major settlements further to the south are Chellah[2] and Mogador. When Carthage fell to Ancient Rome, Lixus, Chellah and Mogador were annexed to the Kingdom of Mauretania. This ancient Amazigh city gradually grew in importance, later coming under Carthaginian domination. After the destruction of Carthage, Lixus fell to Amazigh (Berber) control, reaching its zenith during the reign of the Amazigh king Juba II. Some ancient Greek writers located at Lixus the mythological garden of the Hesperides, the keepers of the golden apples. The name of the city which was often mentioned by writers from Hanno the Navigator to the Geographer of Ravenna and confirmed by the legend on its coins and by an inscription. The ancients believed this to be the site of the Garden of the Hesperides and of a sanctuary of Hercules, where Hercules gathered gold apples, more ancient than the one at Cadiz, Spain. However, there are no grounds for the claim that Lixus was founded at the end of the second millennium BC. Life was maintained there nevertheless until the Islamic conquest of North Africa by the presence of a mosque and a house with a patio with walls covered with painted stuccos. Today In the 2014 Moroccan census Larache recorded a population of 125,008 inhabitants. Periods of Berber, Arab and Spanish rule have left their mark, although the most dominant is the Muslim influence. The layout of the old town is typically Moorish, while houses in the new town seem to be Andalusian in style. Climate Larache has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa) with heavy rainfall. The summers are moderately hot and sunny - ideal for the city's beaches - and the winters are wet and cool.

The final Spanish protectorate included a southern strip centred on Cape Juby. On July 29, 1916, Francisco Bens officially occupied Cape Juby.

Founded on 17 June 1975, it was known as the New Era Educational Institute, and was located in Echague, Quiapo, Manila, along Carlos Palanca St. It initially offered only secondary education (high school) but later expanded in 1977 to serve technical and vocational courses under its Center for Livelihood and Skills Training (CLST). It also offers graduate programmes. In 1981, it was renamed New Era College after the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) granted collegiate status, and later in June 1995, to its present name, New Era University, when the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) granted university status. It is run by the INC for the educational needs of INC members although it accepts enrollments from non-INC members as well. Formerly, under the university umbrella, it ran the College of Evangelical Ministry (now Iglesia Ni Cristo (Church of Christ) School for Ministers), where the INC trains male members to become ministers. Other colleges include College of Engineering and Technology, College of Nursing, College of Business Administration, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Education, College of Music, College of Law, College of Computer Studies, College of Accountancy, School of Graduate Studies, and the new then College of Communication, College of Medicine and Center for Medical and Health Allied Sciences. It offers new courses in the Philippines including BS Real Estate Management and BS Criminology. NEU is the legal owner of the Philippine Arena, which is the largest indoor arena in the world with a seating capacity over 50,000. It annually hosts its graduation ceremonies at the Philippine Arena in Ciudad de Victoria which is being developed because there is a proposal to move the main campus of NEU in this location. Networks The University is a member of National Athletic Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (NAASCU), an athletic association of colleges and universities in the Philippines, established in 2001. It is a member of Philippine Association for Technological Education (PATE) and is affiliated with Eagle Broadcasting Corporation. Developments New Era University bus, San Fernando City, Pampanga New Era University submitted itself to voluntary accreditation. Today, four programs of the University enjoy Level II step 1 reaccreditation with the benefit of full curricular deregulation (Master of Arts in Education, Business Education and Administration courses, Arts and Sciences Courses, and Education Courses). The students, faculty and staff members, and administration conduct community extension services. The Balik-Aral Program for out-of-school youths is conducted by NEU in coordination with the Department of Education Culture and Sports, now the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Iglesia ni Cristo Social Services Department. This programme brings classes for the out-of- school youth right in their own vicinity using the local facilities of the Church, the expertise of NEU-trained teachers and the teaching-learning modules from DepEd. With the CHED implementation of the National Service Training Program (NSTP) in June 2002, NEU received commendations from town mayors and community leaders for its implementation of all three NSTP components: Literacy Training Service, Community Welfare Service Training, and Reserved Office Training Corps. New Era University will soon have its Bocaue/Santa Maria Campus being built as part of Philippine Arena complex in Ciudad de Victoria at Bocaue, Bulacan. It has also established two more colleges ‚Äì College of Medicine and College of Architecture. Academic Highlights Inspired by the attainment of university status and motivated by the challenge of excellence in education, New Era University submitted itself to voluntary accreditation. Today, four programmes of the University enjoy Level II step 1 reaccreditation with the benefit of full curricular deregulation (Master of Arts in Education, Business Education and Administration courses, Arts and Sciences Courses, and Education Courses). Side by side with its academic functions, NEU also fulfills its socio-civic responsibility towards the larger community that lies beyond its walls. The students, faculty and staff members, and administration all do their share in conducting community extension services. Another project is the Balik-Aral Programme for out-of- school youths conducted by NEU in close coordination with the Department of Education Culture and Sports, now the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Iglesia ni Cristo Social Services Department. This programme brings classes for the out-of-school youth right in their own vicinity using the local facilities of the Church, the expertise of NEU- trained teachers and the teaching-learning modules from DepEd. With the CHED implementation of the National Service Training Program (NSTP) in June 2002, NEU received commendations from town mayors and community leaders for its implementation of all three NSTP components: Literacy Training Service, Community Welfare Service Training a, and Reserved Office Training Corps. In April 2013, the New Era Junior Marketing Association (NEJMA) under College of Business Administration was hailed as the country's top junior marketing association and most outstanding organization of the year by the Philippine Junior Marketing Association (PJMA) marking as the inaugural winner of prestigious Marketista Awards 2013 which also organized by PJMA. This is the first time since 2002 that New Era University bagged the title beating De La Salle University, University of Santo Tomas, Ateneo De Manila University and University of the Philippines.

Born in 1896, MacDermott was educated at Campbell College, Belfast, and the Queen's University of Belfast. After serving with the Machine Guns Corps in France, Belgium and Germany during the First World War, for which he was awarded the Military Cross and reached the rank of Lieutenant, MacDermott was called to the Irish bar in 1921. Eight years later he was appointed to determine industrial assurance disputes in Northern Ireland, and in 1931 he became a lecturer in Jurisprudence at Queen's University, teaching for four years. In 1936 he was made a King's Counsel, and two years later he was elected to the Northern Ireland House of Commons as an Ulster Unionist member for Queen's University. In 1940, MacDermott was appointed Minister of Public Security in the Government of Northern Ireland, and the following year became the region's Attorney General. He was succeeded in this post by William Lowry, whose son, Lord Lowry, would eventually succeed MacDermott as Lord Chief Justice. In 1944 he resigned his parliamentary seat on appointment as a High Court Judge for Northern Ireland, and three years later, on 23 April 1947 was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, effectively becoming a life peer as Baron MacDermott, of Belmont in the City of Belfast. Lord MacDermott returned from the House of Lords to take up his appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland; his successors to the latter office have become Law Lords subsequently. Whilst LCJ he was affectionately known as \\"the baron\\". In 1977, aged over eighty, Lord MacDermott offered to redeliver a lecture at the Ulster College, which had been interrupted by a bomb meant for him and which had severely wounded him.The Stormont Papers; biography; accessed 20 February 2020. Having been made a Northern Ireland Privy Counsellor seven years earlier, Lord MacDermott was admitted to the British Privy Council in 1947. Four years later, in 1951, he was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, a post he held for twenty years. He was also Pro- Chancellor of his alma mater from 1951‚Äì69. In 1958, he chaired the commission on the Isle of Man Constitution. He died in 1979. In 1926, he wed Louise Palmer Johnston, later Lady MacDermott.

The province is remembered today by philatelists for having issued postage stamps from 1881 on,According to the Scott Catalogue the first stamps were issued in 1880, but the Michel Catalog lists these overprints as not being issued until 1881. This is clarified by W.A.S.

Upcott Gill, London, pages 207-210, although a postcard was issued locally for internal use in 1880. Overprint on stamp of Turkey The 1878 Treaty of Berlin provided for the Ottoman Empire to issue special stamps for Eastern Rumelia. However, they were slow to do so. In 1880, in part a reaction to the local postcard, the Turkish government sent some 50,000 piasters worth of Turkish stamps overprinted with \\"ROUMELIE / ORIENTALE\\" in an oval. The Eastern Rumelian government found these to be unsatisfactory in presenting the province as an autonomous region, and refused to issue them. A compromise was reached, new stamps specifically printed for Eastern Rumelia were sent from Constantinople and both versions were issued on 16 January 1881. Overprints on stamps of Turkey were made locally. First was an \\"R.O.\\"\\"The Beginners' Guide: A Guide to Classification (Continued)\\" Mekeel's Weekly Stamp News 1 March 1913, page 80 that was stamped both on regular Turkish stamps and the oval overprinted ones. This was done in Philippopolis. In addition, a pattern of bars was sometimes used. All of these overprints are uncommon and extensively counterfeited. The stamps that were specifically printed for Eastern Rumelia used design elements from the existing Ottoman postage stamps, differing from them by having the Greek inscription ŒëŒΩŒ±œÑŒøŒªŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ°œâŒºœÖŒªŒØŒ± (Anatolian (i.e. Eastern) Rumelia) above the \\"Emp. Ottoman\\" and with French and Bulgarian inscriptions of the name in small letters along the left and right sides. In 1884, a 5 paras stamp and a ten paras stamp of a second issue of this design, with changed colors, were issued. Higher denominations for the 1884 issue were prepared, but not issued. Both of these sets, 1881 and 1884, were printed in Constantinople.\\"Unwelcome Turkish Labels\\" Boys Life October 1917, pages 46-47, page 47The Collectors Club philatelist: Volumes 38-39 (1959) page 214 Most of these types are quite common, but perforation variations can be scare. On September 10, 1885, the existing Rumelian issues were overprinted with two different images of the Bulgarian lion, and then with the lion in a frame and \\"Bulgarian Post\\" in Bulgarian (Cyrillic letters). As with the first overprints, these are uncommon, with prices ranging from US$ 6 to $ 200, and counterfeits are widespread. From 1886 on, the province used Bulgarian stamps.

The issue of 1890 was a key plate stamp design with the usual profile of Queen Victoria, eight values ranging from 1/2d to 5 shillings. In 1897 they were overprinted with a logo commemorating Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, and in 1902 the 4, 6, and 7d were surcharged with a value of 1d. The 1890 issue design was also used for stamps of King Edward VII, as well as for King George V and George VI, with several changes of watermark and colors. In 1928 a large one-pound stamp was introduced, and updated for the new monarch when George VI took the throne. The common design commemorative stamps of the Commonwealth between 1946 and 1949 included stamps inscribed \\"LEEWARD ISLANDS\\".

A first-day cover franked with all of the four UPU stamps of 1949. This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. The islands in the South Pacific Ocean were a British protectorate from 1892 and colony from 1916. First stamps The first mail service to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands was ad hoc, depending on which ships were calling at the various islands. A regular service began in 1911; Edward VII postage stamps of Fiji were overprinted GILBERT & ELLICE / PROTECTORATE and put on sale on 1 January of that year, followed in March by a set of four stamps depicting a Pandanus tree, inscribed GILBERT & ELLICE ISLANDS / PROTECTORATE. George V and George VI These were followed in 1912 by George V stamps of the common type, inscribed GILBERT & ELLICE ISLANDS. A new definitive series came out starting 14 January 1939, featuring local scenery and a profile of George VI. These were updated in 1956 with a profile of Elizabeth II. Queen Elizabeth II A set of four stamps on 1 May 1960 commemorated the 60th anniversary of the discovery of phosphate at Ocean Island. The definitive series of 1965 depicted daily activities of the natives, but a decimal currency conversion necessitated surcharges in 1966 and a reissue of the stamps in 1968. The colony issued about 10-15 stamps per year thereafter, usually as sets of four, until the end of 1975. Establishment of Kiribati & Tuvalu In 1976, the islands became two separate colonies and later independent as Kiribati and Tuvalu. The Gilbert Islands issued stamps under that name before attaining independence on 12 July 1979 as the Republic of Kiribati. The first stamps of Kiribati were a pair issued on 19 November 1979 to mark the independence of the country. The Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau was established on 1 January 1976, which was the day the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony was dissolved and Tuvalu established as a separate British dependency. The first stamp issue was a set of provisional overprinted definitive stamps and a commemorative set of three stamps. The first postage stamp cancellation devices were put into use the same day.

The Stamp Atlas. London: Macdonald, 1986, pp.317-319.  First stamps  From 1894 to 1902, the colony of French Sudan used the general issues of the French colonies (Alpheus Dubois and Group types) with the name of the colony. In 1903, the group-type stamps were marked \\"SENEGAMBIA AND NIGER\\", the new name of the colony. In 1906, new stamps were issued marked \\"Upper Senegal and Niger\\", a state which came into existence in 1904, with varied illustrations including colonial personalities: General Louis Faidherbe and Governor General No√´l Ballay in 1906 and a Tuareg horseman in 1914. All the above stamps of this colony with its successive names became uncommon for letters until 1920. In 1920, Upper Senegal and Niger became French Sudan and some of its regions became Upper Volta and Niger. The Tuareg horseman stamps were widely used in these three colonies until the late 1920s. From 1931 to 1944, the subjects were the Colonial Exhibition of 1931, Pierre and Marie Curie, the explorer Ren√© Cailli√© or the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille.

French West Africa  French West Africa 1947 series From 1944 to 1959, the French West Africa issues were used in the French Sudan. Various territories were joined in 1895 by the French colonial authorities in a federation known as French West Africa (AOF). These territories included Mauritania, Senegal, French Sudan (now Mali), French Guinea (now Guinea), C√¥te d'Ivoire, Niger, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) and Dahomey (now Benin). The French colonial territories in the federation issued their own postage stamps until 1943. In many cases, the stamps were inscribed with the name of the federation \\"Afrique Occidentale Fran√ßaise\\" as well as the colony's own name. In 1943 and 1944, stamps of Senegal and Mauritania were overprinted with new values and valid throughout French West Africa. The first issues printed specifically for the federation were the Eboue common design type and a definitive series depicting colonial soldiers, both in 1945. A series of 1947 featured 19 scenes and people of the various colonies, then during the 1950s, there were about 30 various commemoratives.

Her New York Times column, Public and Private, won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1992. She began her journalism career in 1974 as a reporter for the New York Post. Between 1977 and 1994 she held several posts at The New York Times. Her semi-autobiographical novel One True Thing (1994) served as the basis for the 1998 film starring Meryl Streep and Ren√©e Zellweger. Life and career Anna Quindlen was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 8, 1952, the daughter of Prudence (n√©e Pantano, 1928‚Äì1972) and Robert Quindlen. Her father was Irish American and her mother was Italian American. Quindlen graduated in 1970 from South Brunswick High School in South Brunswick, New Jersey and then attended Barnard College, from which she graduated in 1974. She is married to New Jersey attorney Gerald Krovatin, whom she met while in college. Their sons Quindlen Krovatin and Christopher Krovatin are published authors, and daughter Maria is an actress, comedian and writer. Anna Quindlen left journalism in 1995 to become a full- time novelist. In 1999, she joined Newsweek, writing a bi-weekly column until she announced her semi-retirement in the May 18, 2009, issue of the magazine. Quindlen is known as a critic of what she perceives to be the fast-paced and increasingly materialistic nature of modern American life. Much of her personal writing centers on her mother, who died from ovarian cancer, when Quindlen was 19 years old. She has written nine novels, several of which have been adapted into motion pictures. One True Thing was made into a feature film in 1998. It starred Meryl Streep, who received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for the role. Black and Blue and Blessings were made into television movies in 1999 and 2003, respectively. Quindlen participates in LearnedLeague under the name \\"QuindlenA\\". One True Thing In 1994, her semi-autobiographical novel, titled One True Thing, was published. The book focuses on the relationship between a young woman and her mother, who is dying from cancer. Quindlen's own mother, Prudence Quindlen, died in 1972 while in her 40s from ovarian cancer. At the time Quindlen was a college student, but came home to take care of her mother. In 1998, a film of the same name was released. The movie starred Meryl Streep and Ren√©e Zellweger as Kate and Ellen Gulden, fictionalized versions of Prudence and Anna Quindlen. Streep was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. Criticism Writing in The New Republic, critic Lee Siegel cited Quindlen as an example of the \\"monsters of empathy\\" who \\"self subjugate and domesticate and assimilate every distant tragedy.\\" He coined the term \\"The Quindlen Effect\\" to describe this phenomenon and suggested that it began with her Times column of December 13, 1992, in which Quindlen assailed the four alleged perpetrators of the Glen Ridge rape. \\"True to her niche,\\" Siegel wrote, \\"Quindlen attacked with scathing indignation actions that no sane Times reader would ever defend.\\" Siegel also referred to Barbara Kingsolver in the same essay, along with Quindlen, derisively as \\"Nice Queens.\\" In 1999, Villanova University invited Anna Quindlen to deliver the annual commencement address. But once the announcement was made, a group of pro-life students planned a protest against Quindlen's positions on reproductive rights and she withdrew as speaker. The following year, however, she spoke at Villanova's graduation.

It began in 1880 as a protectorate, and its borders with Cabinda, Cameroons, and the Congo Free State were established by treaties over the next decade. French Congo was temporarily divided between Gabon and Middle Congo in 1906, before being reunited as French Equatorial Africa in 1910 in an attempt to copy the relative success of French West Africa. The first postage stamps for the colony were overprints issued in 1891 on the generic issue for the French colonies. They read \\"Congo francais\\" followed by the value; either 5c, 10c, or 15c. In 1892 the omnibus Navigation and Commerce issue included stamps inscribed \\"CONGO FRANCAIS\\". A pictorial series followed in 1900; its images included a leopard, Bakalois woman, and a coconut grove, printed in pairs of colors, some rather garish. A couple of provisional surcharges on the Navigation and Commerce stamps proved necessary in 1900, and two more were needed on the pictorials in 1903.https://web.archive.org/web/20171214170827/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/africa/french-congo/ Retrieved 12 August 2018. The watermarks of the pictorials of 1900 are unlike any other watermarks used in the French area: they are plant branches, with thistle for the low values (up to 15c), rose for middle values (up to 75c), and an olive branch for the three franc values. Stamps of French Congo were replaced by the issues of Gabon and Middle Congo in 1904.

Bergedorf is the smallest field of German stamp collecting.  Historical development  Due to its good geographic location, Bergedorf and environs (the Bi-Urban Condominium of the sovereign city states of L√ºbeck and Hamburg to be precise) had already received postal services from the Hanseatic league early on. The city's postal connections to neighbouring Hamburg were especially well developed at an early stage. Since the 1420 Treaty of Perleberg, Bergedorf with Geesthacht and the Vierlande municipalities (Altengamme, Curslack, Kirchwerder and Neuengamme) had belonged to both of the Hanseatic cities of Hamburg and L√ºbeck, therefore named Beiderst√§dtischer Besitz (Bi-Urban Condominium). Because the condominium belonged to both cities, the curious condition arose where the condomimium's post could not be administered by either Hamburg or L√ºbeck. Therefore, the condomimium formed its own tiny autonomous postal jurisdiction. Several other principalities also established postal departments in the condomium's capital Bergedorf city. In 1746, Electoral Hanover set up its own postal department in Bergedorf city, which lasted as Royal Hanoverian post until 1846. In 1785, the dynasty of Thurn und Taxis succeeded Hanover and established its own postal department, which was not closed until 1851. In 1839, Prussia finally opened a postal department in Bergedorf city as well. From 1806 to 1813, the condominium was first occupied, and as of 1811 annexed by the First French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars. During this time, the postal system was taken over by the Imperial French Post. Finally on 1 April 1847, the Beiderst√§dtisches Postamt (Bi-Urban Mail) or L√ºbeck-Hamburgisches Postamt (Postal Department of L√ºbeck and Hamburg) emerged from the Prussian postal department. In the following years, this arrangement was extended. In 1856, further departments opened in the condominial territory, namely in the Geesthacht exclave (since 1937 no part of the region any more) and in Kirchwerder. From 1855 to 1856, the Bi-Urban Mail signed several postal agreements modelled on the German-Austrian Postal Treaty, including agreements with Prussia and Mecklenburg-Schwerin. After Hamburg and L√ºbeck had already issued their first stamps in 1859, Bergedorf followed in 1861. However, Hamburg's stamps were officially sold beside those from the Bi-Urban Mail at the post office counters.  Stamp issues by the Bergedorf Bi-Urban Mail  On 1 November 1861, five definitive stamps with values of ¬Ω, 1, 1¬Ω, 3, and 4 Hamburg Schillings (16 schillings made up 1 Hamburg mark) were issued in Bergedorf. These five values could satisfy the postal tariffs for all distance and weight needs of the time. At that time (1863), only 12,468 people lived in the whole postal region.Statistik des Hamburgischen Staats, Statistisches Bureau der Deputation f√ºr directe Steuern (ed.), 'Heft I. Ergebnisse der Volksz√§hlung vom 3ten December 1866 - Stand der Bev√∂lkerung', Hamburg: K√ºmpel, 1867, p. 1. The imperforated definitive stamps were printed when required and were valid until 31 December 1867. The stamps are square in shape. Besides the value, the country's name and the term \\"Postmarke\\", the centre of each stamp depicted one half of the coat of arms of each of Hamburg and L√ºbeck. The Bergedorf stamp series is often referred to as a \\"growing series\\" because each value is a little bit larger than its predecessor. Thus, the 4 Schilling value looks twice as large as the ¬Ω Schilling value. Together with the different paper colours of the values, the sizing helped to distinguish between the various stamps.  Unification with Hamburg  Effective 1 January 1868, the Free and Hanseatic city of Hamburg bought L√ºbeck's share in the Bi-Urban Condominium which passed completely into the former's ownership. On this date, the joint entry into the North German Confederation (the predecessor of the 1871 German Empire) took place. Since that time, the postal history of Bergedorf shares that of the North German Confederation. Bergedorf's five stamps were only valid until that day.

The freeway begins in Burien at an interchange with SR 509 and travels east to serve Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport and intersect SR 99 in SeaTac. SR 518 continues east into Tukwila and ends at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5), as the freeway becomes I-405. The highway was codified in 1937 as the western segment of Secondary State Highway 1L (SSH 1L) and designated as SR 518 during the 1964 highway renumbering. During the 1970s, the roadway was widened into a freeway to serve the airport and serves over 100,000 vehicles per day. Route description I-5 and I-405 in Tukwila. SR 518 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 509 east of Burien and travels east as a divided freeway, passing north of Highline High School. The freeway intersects Des Moines Memorial Drive and 154th Street north of Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport and continues east into SeaTac. SR 518 intersects the Airport Expressway and International Boulevard, signed as SR 99, south of the Tukwila International Boulevard station. The freeway follows the Central Link light rail line into Tukwila and intersects 51st Avenue before an interchange with I-5. At the interchange, located northwest of the Westfield Southcenter Mall, the Central Link turns north along I-5 and SR 518 ends as the roadway continues east as I-405 towards Renton. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 38,000 and 102,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly between Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and I-5. SR 518 are designated as part of the National Highway System and as a Highway of Statewide Significance for serving Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. History Southbound I-5 at its interchange with I-405 and SR 518 in Tukwila. A highway between Burien and Tukwila has existed since the 1890s and was first codified in 1937 as a segment of SSH 1L, which extended from PSH 5 in Renton west to intersect PSH 1 and US 99 in Tukwila and end at SSH 1K south of Sunnydale, later renamed Burien. The section between PSH 5 in Renton and PSH 1 in Tukwila was removed in 1957 after the construction of the Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport, located on PSH 1 and US 99. The remaining highway was later re-designated as SR 518 during the 1964 highway renumbering, being codified as such in 1970. The western terminus of SR 518, an interchange with SR 509, was opened to traffic in November 1968, while the Airport Expressway was opened in 1970 and widened in the 1990s by the Port of Seattle. The freeway segment between SR 99 and I-5 was built in the 1970s. No major revisions to the route of SR 518 have occurred since the 1990s, however SR 99 from SR 518 to SR 599 was removed to the highway system in 2003. Beginning in 2005, an elevated light rail guideway was constructed on the north side of SR 518, for Sound Transit's Central Link line serving Downtown Seattle, the Rainier Valley and Sea-Tac Airport. The construction led to nighttime closures of the highway and other interruptions until construction finished in 2007. Tukwila International Boulevard station was built to the north of SR 518 at its interchange with SR 99 (International Boulevard) near Sea-Tac Airport.

It states that if a point x of Rd lies in the convex hull of a set P, then x can be written as the convex combination of at most d + 1 points in P. Namely, there is a subset ‚Ä≤ of P consisting of d + 1 or fewer points such that x lies in the convex hull of ‚Ä≤. Equivalently, x lies in an r-simplex with vertices in P, where r \\\\leq d. The smallest r that makes the last statement valid for each x in the convex hull of P is defined as the Carath√©odory's number of P. Depending on the properties of P, upper bounds lower than the one provided by Carath√©odory's theorem can be obtained. Note that P need not be itself convex. A consequence of this is that P‚Ä≤ can always be extremal in P, as non-extremal points can be removed from P without changing the membership of x in the convex hull. The similar theorems of Helly and Radon are closely related to Carath√©odory's theorem: the latter theorem can be used to prove the former theorems and vice versa. See in particular p.109 The result is named for Constantin Carath√©odory, who proved the theorem in 1907 for the case when P is compact. In 1914 Ernst Steinitz expanded Carath√©odory's theorem for any sets P in Rd.  Example  Consider a set P = {(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)} which is a subset of R2. The convex hull of this set is a square. Consider now a point x = (1/4, 1/4), which is in the convex hull of P. We can then construct a set {(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)} = ‚Ä≤, the convex hull of which is a triangle and encloses x, and thus the theorem works for this instance, since ‚Ä≤ = 3. It may help to visualise Carath√©odory's theorem in 2 dimensions, as saying that we can construct a triangle consisting of points from P that encloses any point in P. Proof Let x be a point in the convex hull of P. Then, x is a convex combination of a finite number of points in P : :\\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\lambda_j \\\\mathbf{x}_j where every xj is in P, every Œªj is (w.l.o.g.) positive, and \\\\sum_{j=1}^k\\\\lambda_j=1. Suppose k > d + 1 (otherwise, there is nothing to prove). Then, the vectors x2 ‚àí x1, ..., xk ‚àí x1 are linearly dependent, so there are real scalars Œº2, ..., Œºk, not all zero, such that :\\\\sum_{j=2}^k \\\\mu_j (\\\\mathbf{x}_j-\\\\mathbf{x}_1)=\\\\mathbf{0}. If Œº1 is defined as :\\\\mu_1:= -\\\\sum_{j=2}^k \\\\mu_j then :\\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\mu_j \\\\mathbf{x}_j=\\\\mathbf{0} :\\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\mu_j=0 and not all of the Œºj are equal to zero. Therefore, at least one Œºj > 0\\\\. Then, :\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\lambda_j \\\\mathbf{x}_j-\\\\alpha\\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\mu_j \\\\mathbf{x}_j = \\\\sum_{j=1}^k (\\\\lambda_j-\\\\alpha\\\\mu_j) \\\\mathbf{x}_j for any real Œ±. In particular, the equality will hold if Œ± is defined as : \\\\alpha:=\\\\min_{1\\\\leq j \\\\leq k} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\tfrac{\\\\lambda_j}{\\\\mu_j}:\\\\mu_j>0\\\\right\\\\\\\\}=\\\\tfrac{\\\\lambda_i}{\\\\mu_i}. Note that Œ± > 0, and for every j between 1 and k, :\\\\lambda_j-\\\\alpha\\\\mu_j \\\\geq 0. In particular, Œªi ‚àí Œ±Œºi = 0 by definition of Œ±. Therefore, :\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^k (\\\\lambda_j-\\\\alpha\\\\mu_j) \\\\mathbf{x}_j where every \\\\lambda_j - \\\\alpha \\\\mu_j is nonnegative, their sum is one , and furthermore, \\\\lambda_i-\\\\alpha\\\\mu_i=0. In other words, x is represented as a convex combination of at most k-1 points of P. This process can be repeated until x is represented as a convex combination of at most d + 1 points in P. Alternative proofs uses Helly's theorem or the Perron‚ÄìFrobenius theorem. See pages 40‚Äì41.  Variants  = Carath√©odory's theorem for the conical hull = If a point x of Rd lies in the conical hull of a set P, then x can be written as the conical combination of at most d points in P. Namely, there is a subset ‚Ä≤ of P consisting of d or fewer points, such that x lies in the conical hull of ‚Ä≤. The proof is similar to the original theorem; the difference is that, in a d-dimensional space, the maximum size of a linearly- independent set is d, while the maximum size of an affinely-independent set is d+1. = Dimensionless variant = Recently, Adiprasito, Barany, Mustafa and Terpai proved a variant of Caratheodory's theorem that does not depend on the dimension of the space. = Colorful Carath√©odory theorem = Let X1, ..., Xd+1 be sets in Rd and let x be a point contained in the intersection of the convex hulls of all these d+1 sets. Then there is a set T = {x1, ..., xd+1}, where x1 ‚àà X1, ..., xd+1 ‚àà Xd+1, such that the convex hull of T contains the point x. By viewing the sets X1, ..., Xd+1 as different colors, the set T is made by points of all colors, hence the \\"colorful\\" in the theorem's name. The set T is also called a rainbow simplex, since it is a d-dimensional simplex in which each corner has a different color. This theorem has a variant in which the convex hull is replaced by the conical hull. Let X1, ..., Xd be sets in Rd and let x be a point contained in the intersection of the conical hulls of all these d sets. Then there is a set T = {x1, ..., xd}, where x1 ‚àà X1, ..., xd+1 ‚àà Xd+1, such that the conical hull of T contains the point x. Mustafa and Ray extended this colorful theorem from points to convex bodies.

It was founded by the three Shubert brothers in the late 19th century. They steadily expanded, owning many theaters in New York and across the country. Since then it has gone through changes of ownership, but is still a major theater chain. History The Shubert Organization was founded by the Shubert brothers, Sam S. Shubert, Lee Shubert, and Jacob J. Shubert of Syracuse, New York ‚Äì colloquially and collectively known as \\"The Shuberts\\" ‚Äì in the late 19th century in upstate New York, entering into New York City productions in 1900. The organization produced a large number of shows and began acquiring theaters. Sam Shubert died in 1905; by 1916 the two remaining brothers had become powerful theater moguls with a nationwide presence. In 1907, the Shuberts tried to enter vaudeville with the United States Amusement Co. In the spring of 1920 they made another attempt, establishing the Shubert Advanced Vaudeville with Lee Shubert as President and playing two shows per day in Boston, Dayton, Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia and in September 1921 opening in New York. In April 1922, the Shuberts teamed with Isidore Herk and E. Thomas Beatty to form the Affiliated Theatres Corporation, which would book shows for the chain. Faced with fierce competition from the B. F. Keith Circuit, the Shuberts closed their vaudeville operation in February 1923. By 1929, the Shubert Theatre chain included Broadway's most important venues, the Winter Garden, the Sam S. Shubert, and the Imperial Theaters, and owned, managed, operated, or booked nearly a thousand theaters nationwide. The company continued to produce stage productions in New York until the 1940s, returning to producing Broadway productions in the 1970s after a hiatus. The company was reorganized in 1973, and as of 2016 owned or operated seventeen Broadway theaters in New York City, two off-Broadway theaters ‚Äî Stage 42 and New World Stages ‚Äî and the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia. It leases Boston's Shubert Theatre to the Citi Performing Arts Center. Shubert Ticketing, which includes Telecharge, handles tickets for 70 theaters. Several former Shubert- owned theaters across the United States are still referred to by the Shubert name. One of the most famous is the New Haven Shubert, the second theater ever built by the Shubert Organization. Until the 1970s, major Broadway producers often premiered shows there before opening in New York. It was immortalized in many mid-20th century films, such as All About Eve. Another important regional theater was the Shubert in Chicago, Illinois, located within the Majestic Building at 22 West Monroe Street. Originally known as the Majestic Theatre, the Shubert Organization purchased it in 1945 and rechristened it the \\"Sam Shubert Theatre\\". The Shuberts sold the theatre to the Nederlander Organization in 1991 and is now known as the CIBC Theatre. In 2016, it sold longtime headquarters at 1700 Broadway, to Ruben Cos for $280 million.

The Far Eastern Republic, sometimes called the Chita Republic, existed from April 1920 to November 1922 in the easternmost part of Siberia. It was formed from the Amur, Transbaikal, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and Primorye regions. In theory, it extended from Lake Baikal to Vladivostok but, in May 1921, the Priamur and Maritime Provinces seceded.Gibbons, p.954. Although nominally independent, it was largely controlled by the RSFSR and its main purpose was to be a democratic buffer state between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by Japan during the Russian Civil War to avoid war with Japan. Initially, its capital was Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude), but from October 1920 it was Chita. On 15 November 1922, after the war ended and the Japanese withdrew from Vladivostok, the Far Eastern Republic was annexed by Soviet Russia.Rossiter & Flower, p.108. Postage stamps =Coalition Government= In 1920 the RSFSR by agreement with the communists, social revolutionists and social democrats formed a three-party coalition government called the Far Eastern Republic (F.E.R.). The Chairman of the F.E.R. was Alexander Krasnochekoff. In September 1920 this government ordered its Central Postal Administration to collect all stocks of the remaining Tsarist postage stamps from all post offices in the area of the F.E.R. Large supplies of the Imperial Russian 1909-1917 'Arms' issue were on hand at the main post office of Khabarovsk and also at Vladivostok. At first mail was franked with these 'Arms' stamps and the still current Kolchak (Siberia) overprinted stamps. This introduced the danger of revenue loss due to imported 'Arms' stamps. The decision was hence made to overprint all the 'Arms' stamps with the Russian initials 'DBP' meaning Far Eastern Republic (Dalne-Vostochnaya Respublika), and to accept only these for franking within the F.E.R. It remains uncertain what the exact issue date was; sources mention November 23 as well as December 12, 1920. After the 'DBP' or DVR overprinted stamps were exhausted, four different new stamps modelled on the Tsarist 'Arms' type of 1909-1917 were printed in 1921 in Vladivostok. The exact issue date is unknown; production numbers range from 600,000 to 1,000,000. =Priamur Provisional Government, Merkulov= In March 1921 a coup d'√©tat was carried out. The F.E.R. government was abolished and the Priamur Provisional Government (P.V.P.) was formed, headed by the brothers Spiridon and Nikolai Merkulov. On May 22, 1922 an overprint was applied by the Vladivostok State Bank to four of the 1921 definitive issues consisting of an oval and '26.V.1921-1922'. It commemorated the first anniversary of the Merkulov government. The stamps were to be used in the Southern Primorsk Oblast. Issue numbers were low, about 2,000. In addition to these overprints a representative of the Merkulov government had the Tsarist 'Arms' type of 1909-1917 overprinted in 1921 at Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. The overprint bears the letters 'N na A/PVP', and the new gold kopek values. It was done by handstamp since all the printing works in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur had been destroyed.

The rural assembly appointed General Mikhail Konstantinovich Diterikhs () as Governor and military commander of the rural armed forces (Zemskaya Rat) of the Priamur Zemstvo territory. Shortly after the appointment Diterikhs overthrew the Merkulov government, and renamed the area 'Priamurskii Zemskii Krai' (Priamur Rural Area'). Diterikhs did not recognize the F.E.R. and had the 'DVR', the 1921 regular issues and Imperial Russian 1909-1917 'Arms' issue overprinted 'Priamurskii Zemskii Krai'. The stamps were overprinted by the Vladivostok State Bank between August and September 1922, and used in the Southern Primorsk Oblast between September and December 1922. =Military Revolutionary Committee= In October 1922 the Japanese evacuated the Maritime Province and Diterikhs. Vladivostok was taken by the Red Army and set up a Military Revolutionary Committee. 10,000 Sets definitive stamps of the F.E.R. were overprinted '1917.7.XI.1922' commemorating the fifth anniversary of the October Revolution, and issued on November 7, 1922. These stamps were used until early 1923. The F.E.R. ceased to exist as an independent state on November 15, 1922. During 1923 and early 1924 various Siberian stamp issues remained in circulation, mostly the Chita issues.

Similar to the stamps the overprint consisted of the Russian initials 'DBP' meaning Far Eastern Republic (Dalne-Vostochnaya Respublika), and was placed horizontally on the imprinted stamp. Four different postal cards were used. Postal cards of 3 kopeks (1909), 4 kopeks (Romanov card of 1913) 5 kopeks brown (Kerensky card of 1917) and 5 kopeks reply card (Kerensky card of 1917) were overprinted. Tsarist wrappers of 1890 and 1891, the 1 kopek orange and 2 kopek green were used. Four different wrappers can be distinguished although some catalogues subdivide each 2 kopek wrapper into two types with differences in size, making a total of six different wrappers.Michel Ganzsachen-Katalog Europa Ost 2001, p.535. Collecting stamps and postal stationery of the Republic of the Far East Several of the above stamps were produced in large numbers, and are readily available today, while others are very rare. Genuine usages on cover are seldom seen for some issues, and are somewhat scarce for most. Some alleged stamp issues of the Far Eastern Republic should be treated with caution, as there is no evidence they were ever postally used. These include the so-called Nikolaevsk-on-Amur issue and the 1923 Vladivostok Airmail issue. Fantasy issues also exist, such as the \\"Pribaikal\\" overprints. The stamps and postal stationery of the Russian civil war period are a complex topic giving an advanced collector a great philatelic challenge. =Stamp societies= * ArGe Russland/UdSSR Arbeitsgemeinschaft Russland/UdSSR e.V. is a German-based Russian philatelic society * BSRP British Society of Russian Philately is a British-based Russian philatelic society * The Rossica Society of Russian Philately is a US-based Russian philatelic society See also ;Russian Civil War: *Provisional Priamurye Government *Siberian Intervention *White movement *Russian Civil War ;Postage stamps and postal history: *Postage stamps and postal history of Russia *Compendium of postage stamp issuers, Russian Civil War ;Catalogues: * Michel catalog * Scott * Stanley Gibbons * Yvert References Further reading * *Stanley Gibbons Ltd, Europe and Colonies 1970, Stanley Gibbons Ltd, 1969 *Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower.

Congenital malformations are physical defects detectable in an infant at birth which can involve many different parts of the body including the brain, hearts, lungs, liver, bones, or intestinal tract. MDS is a contiguous gene syndrome ‚Äì a disorder due to the deletion of multiple gene loci adjacent to one another. The disorder arises from the deletion of part of the small arm of chromosome 17p (which includes both the LIS1 and 14-3-3 epsilon genes), leading to partial monosomy. There may be unbalanced translocations (i.e. 17q:17p or 12q:17p), or the presence of a ring chromosome 17. This syndrome should not be confused with Miller syndrome, an unrelated rare genetic disorder, or Miller Fisher syndrome, a form of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome. Presentation The brain is abnormally smooth, with fewer folds and grooves. The face, especially in children, has distinct characteristics including a short nose with upturned nares, thickened upper lip with a thin vermilion upper border, frontal bossing, small jaw, low- set posteriorly rotated ears, sunken appearance in the middle of the face, widely spaced eyes, and hypertelorism. The forehead is prominent with bitemporal hollowing. Characteristics that are not visual include mental retardation, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, epilepsy, and reduced lifespan.Failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, seizures and decreased spontaneous activity are often seen. Death usually occurs in infancy and childhood. Multiple abnormalities of the brain, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract (the stomach and intestines) may occur. Cause  MDS is a microdeletion syndrome involving loss of the gene on chromosome 17 which is responsible for the syndrome's characteristic sign of lissencephaly. The loss of another gene, , in the same region of chromosome 17 increases the severity of the lissencephaly in patients with Miller‚ÄìDieker syndrome. Additional genes in the deleted region are likely to contribute to the varied features of Miller‚ÄìDieker syndrome. It may be a random event during the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development or due to familial chromosomal rearrangement called chromosomal translocation. In less than 20%, inheritance is through an autosomal dominant pattern. The parent is usually unaffected, but carries a particular chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Increased rate of unexplained fetal loss may be observed in MDS carriers with balanced translocations although they may be otherwise asymptomatic. However, they can become also unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Miller‚ÄìDieker syndrome is usually not inherited. The deletion event occurs randomly during gametogenesis (formation of eggs or sperm) or in early foetal development. Therefore, no history of the disorder is usually seen in their families. Diagnosis The disease may be diagnosed by cytogenetic techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), testing for a microdeletion at LIS1. =Early detection= With the use of prenatal ultrasonographic imaging, early detection of abnormal brain development in the fetus with MDS can be seen. At birth, facial dysmorphism can be present in the infant. Young children, when affected, can suffer from feeding difficulties, severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures. MRI facilitates early detection of this syndrome in children by revealing a \\"smooth brain\\" image, also called lissencephaly. Children with this syndrome may remain underdiagnosed because of rarity and the prevalence of facial features that appear to be dysmorphic. The syndrome shares distinct external features (phenotype) similar to more common syndromes. Lack of relevant family history may delay diagnosis. FDNA provides a service that in turn increases the chances of detecting these distinct characteristics, which, when shown to a geneticist, can assist in reaching the right medical diagnosis. If a couple has had one child with MDS, they can be offered prenatal screening in future pregnancies. This option is particularly important for the 20% of MDS families where one parent carries a balanced chromosome rearrangement. The risk of these couples having another child with MDS depends on the exact type of chromosomal rearrangement present and may be as high as 25‚Äì33%. For families in which both parents' chromosomes are normal, the risk of having another child with MDS is low (1% or less). Either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis can be used early in a pregnancy to obtain a small sample of cells from the developing embryo for chromosome studies. Early prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound is not reliable because the brain is normally smooth until later in pregnancy. Couples who are considering prenatal diagnosis should discuss the risks and benefits of this type of testing with a geneticist or genetic counselor. =Visuals of the brain= The brain is usually grossly abnormal in outline when someone is diagnosed with Miller‚ÄìDieker syndrome. Only a few shallow sulci and shallow Sylvian fissures are seen; this takes on an hourglass or figure-8 appearance on the axial imaging. The thickness and measurement for a person without MDS is 3‚Äì4 mm. With MDS, a person's cortex is measured at 12‚Äì20 mm. Treatment While no cure for MDS is available yet, many complications associated with this condition can be treated, and a great deal can be done to support or compensate for functional disabilities. Because of the diversity of the symptoms, it can be necessary to see a number of different specialists and undergo various examinations, including: * Developmental evaluation * Cardiologists evaluation * Otolaryngology * Treatment of seizures * Urologic evaluation * Genetic counseling-balanced chromosomal translocation should be excluded if parents with an affected child are planning another pregnancy, so parents with affected children should visit a genetic counselor. This disease is fairly uncommon ‚Äì and treatment is scarce Prognosis Most individuals with this condition do not survive beyond childhood. Individuals with MDS usually die in infancy and therefore do not live to the age where they can reproduce and transmit MDS to their offspring. Due to more accurate diagnosis by MRI and improved management of symptoms with medical treatments including gastrostomy(feeding tubes), suction machines, seizure medications, tracheostomy, and management of secretions, more children are surviving into adulthood and have a better quality of life. Development of skills and core strength may be improved with physical therapy, but improvement is limited by the severity of the condition. Some children may be able to sit up, crawl, or say a few basic words, but most are severely developmentally delayed and remain at the level of infants for their lifetime. At all ages the most common cause of death is pneumonia, often after multiple cases have weakened the respiratory function. Epidemiology Miller-Dieker occurs in less than one in 100,000 people and can occur in all races. Given this stastistic, it is conclusive that roughly 75000 people worldwide are affected by MDS. History MDS was named for the two physicians, James Q. Miller and H. Dieker.Dieker, H.; Edwards, R. H.; ZuRhein, G. et al. The lissencephaly syndrome. In: Bergsma, D. : The Clinical Delineation of Birth Defects: Malformation Syndromes. New York: National Foundation-March of Dimes (pub.) II 1969. Pp. 53‚Äì64., who independently described the condition in the 1960s. The hallmark of MDS is lissencephaly, a condition in which the outer layer of the brain, the cerebral cortex, is abnormally thick and lacks the normal convolutions (gyri). In some areas of the brain, gyri are fewer in number but wider than normal (pachygyri). Other areas lack gyri entirely (agyri). Normally, during the third and fourth months of pregnancy, the brain cells in the baby multiply and move to the surface of the brain to form the cortex. Lissencephaly is caused by a failure of this nerve cell migration. MDS is often called Miller-Dieker lissencephaly syndrome. JQ Miller described the disease and in 1969 H Dieker emphasized that it should also take the name lissencephaly syndrome because several malformations occur beyond the brain itself. When MDS was initially described, geneticists assumed it followed an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. In the early 1990s, several patients with Miller‚ÄìDieker syndrome were found to be missing a small portion of chromosome 17. (17p13.3) (a partial deletion).

Freeman and stars Mila Kunis as Rachael Newman, a driven criminology student who is drawn to murder. The film also features William Shatner as her professor. The film was adapted from a script titled The Girl Who Wouldn't Die, and was originally conceived as a thriller with no association with American Psycho. It was not until production began that the film's script was altered with the incorporation of the Patrick Bateman subplot. Plot The film starts with a 12-year-old girl whose babysitter is on a date with serial killer Patrick Bateman. After Bateman kills and starts to dissect her babysitter, the girl stabs him with an ice pick. Fast forward to the present day and the girl, who is named Rachael Newman, is now a college student studying criminology under Professor Starkman, a former FBI agent. Rachael aspires to join the FBI and is determined to get the teaching assistant position under Starkman, which would make her a shoo-in for the FBI training program. Tough competition for the position stands in her way, and Rachael proceeds to kill off classmates one by one. During her killing spree, she decides to see the school psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Daniels. Realizing that Rachael is a textbook sociopath, Daniels tries to warn Starkman, who mistakenly thinks the psycho student is Cassandra Blaire, with whom he had an extramarital affair. When Cassandra reveals that her affair with Professor Starkman has guaranteed her the TA position, Rachael decides to murder her as well. After she does so, Professor Starkman discovers Cassandra's body and calls Daniels to tell him that \\"she's dead\\". But he does not identify the victim, and Daniels assumes it must be Rachael. Distraught, Professor Starkman leaves his teaching position, which angers the obsessed Rachael. She reveals that she is not Rachael Newman; she killed the real Rachael at the beginning of the semester and assumed her identity. During spring break, Rachael stays on campus and locates an intoxicated Starkman, impaired by the effects of Valium and alcohol, and tries to seduce him to get the job. However, Starkman sees she is wearing a dress and necklace he had given to Cassandra. She then confesses her crimes to him, her \\"crush\\" on him, and that she knew about his affairs with various women (which included her former babysitter, whom he indirectly killed, since he had told her about Bateman and she decided to track him down), as he backs up towards the window in a state of confusion and fear. Rachael blows him a kiss, and he falls out the window to his death. As she leaves, Rachael realizes a janitor has witnessed Starkman's death, and she murders the janitor, too. Driving away from campus with Starkman in her car, Rachael is stopped by campus security, whom she stabs to death with an ice pick. As the film reaches its conclusion, Daniels and two cops pursue Rachael in a car chase, started when she sped by the cops who had Daniels in the car. It ends with Rachael driving off a cliff, resulting in the car exploding. At this point, she is presumed to be dead by the cops who witnessed the event and the media. Two years later, Dr. Daniels is giving a lecture on Rachael's mind and how he wrote a book about her. When he looks up from speaking with a student, he sees Rachael, who has not died after all; she indirectly reveals that she killed Starkman's last assistant, Elizabeth McGuire, and stole her identity to get into Quantico. She allows Dr. Daniels to know because she believes there is no point in committing the perfect crime if no one knows about it and she is confident he will not divulge this information because it would make a farce of his best-selling book in which he proclaimed to completely understand her and witnessed her death in the fiery car. The body that was in the car was the real Rachael, whose decaying body had been kept in the killer's dorm closet. It was revealed by another student that she is the youngest agent to be drafted to the Bureau in her sophomore year. As Rachel walks out of his class, Dr. Daniels is visibly shaken by what he had just learned.

It begins south of Discovery Bay at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) south of Discovery Bay and crosses the Hood Canal Bridge over Hood Canal to the terminus of SR 3 near Port Gamble. SR 104 continues southeast onto the Edmonds‚ÄìKingston Ferry to cross the Puget Sound and intersects SR 99 and Interstate 5 (I-5) before ending at SR 522 in Lake Forest Park. SR 104 also has a short spur route that connects the highway to SR 99 at an at-grade signal on the Snohomish-King county line. Established during the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 104 was formed out of four highways, themselves created in 1937: Secondary State Highway 9E (SSH 9E) from Discovery Bay to Port Gamble, Primary State Highway 21 (PSH 21) from Port Gamble to Kingston, SSH 1W within Edmonds, and SSH 2B from Edmonds to Lake Forest Park. PSH 21 was originally part of State Road 21, added to the state highway system in 1915 to connect the Port Gamble-Shine ferry to the Kingston ferry landing. The Edmonds-Kingston ferry at the end of State Road 21 has been in operation under various companies since 1923 and was served by the 14-car City of Edmonds. SSH 9E extended from Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow initially and was moved south and extended to the South Point ferry landing in the late 1940s. The bridge replaced the South Point-Lofall ferry when it opened in 1961, but the ferry was re-used during the construction of the second Hood Canal Bridge after the first bridge sank in 1979 and before the new bridge opened in 1982. The Edmonds-Kingston ferry was added to the state ferry system in 1951 before it was incorporated into SR 104 in 1994. Route description SR 104 westbound on the Hood Canal Bridge, traveling towards the Olympic Peninsula SR 104 begins at an intersection with US 101, located south of Discovery Bay on the Olympic Peninsula. The highway travels south through rural Jefferson County towards Crocker Lake and turns southeast, intersecting SR 19 south of Port Ludlow. SR 104 continues east along the northern shore of Squamish Harbor, part of the Hood Canal, and crosses into Kitsap County on the Hood Canal Bridge, the third longest floating bridge in the world. The highway serves as the northern terminus of SR 3 east of the bridge and turns northeast towards Port Gamble, located on the Kitsap Peninsula. SR 104 turns south along the western shore of Port Gamble, the bay the community is named after, and turns southeast to intersect SR 307. The highway continues east from the intersection to Kingston, where it splits into a one-way pair before the designation travels onto the Edmonds‚ÄìKingston Ferry. The ferry, operated by Washington State Ferries (WSF), takes approximately 30 minutes to cross across Puget Sound. It departs from Kingston on Appletree Cove and arrives in Edmonds in Snohomish County. WSF operates thirteen round-trip crossings every day. Westbound passengers must pay a $7.70 toll or they may alternately pay with a prepaid Wave2Go card. SR 104 resumes in Edmonds on Main Street and crosses a BNSF rail line south of Edmonds Station. The highway turns south at an intersection with SR 524 onto Sunset Avenue towards Woodway. The roadway travels southeast along Edmonds Way towards the Snohomish-King county line, intersecting SR 524 Spur and 5th Street at a grade-separated interchange. Edmonds Way travels through a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 99 before SR 104 intersects its spur route, which travels west towards an at-grade signal with SR 99. The highway continues east along Ballinger Way to a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-5 southeast of Lake Ballinger. The highway travels southeast into Lake Forest Park, where SR 104 ends at SR 522 on the north shore of Lake Washington. SR 104 is considered, by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), an auxiliary route of US 101, part of a numbering system established during the 1964 state highway renumbering. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 3,800 and 44,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Shoreline area. The Edmonds-Kingston ferry carried 3.808 million passengers and 2.025 million vehicles in 2012, according to WSF statistics. The segments of the highway between Discovery Bay and Kingston and SR 99 and I-5 in Edmonds and Shoreline are designated as part of the National Highway System, while the whole route is designated by WSDOT as a Highway of Statewide Significance because it connects major communities in the state of Washington. History Jumbo class serving the Edmonds‚ÄìKingston route in 2008. SR 104 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to several state highways: SSH 9E between Discovery Bay and Port Gamble, PSH 21 between Port Gamble and Kingston, SSH 1W in Edmonds, and SSH 2B between Edmonds and Lake Forest Park. The highway between Port Gamble and Kingston was established in 1915 as part of State Road 21, which extended south to Bremerton. During the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937, State Road 21 was re-designated as PSH 21 and extended south to Gorst. SSH 9E was also established, connecting US 101 and PSH 9 in Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow, along with SSH 1W from US 99 and PSH 1 in Lynnwood through Edmonds to US 99 and PSH 1 in Woodway, following the route of an unpaved road built in the 1890s. SSH 2B was created in 1937 to serve as a connector between US 99 and PSH 1 in Shoreline to a branch of PSH 2 in Lake Forest Park. SSH 9E was extended southeast to the South Point ferry over Hood Canal in 1947, as the ferry traveled east to a branch of PSH 21 at Lofall created in 1949. The highway was moved south from Discovery Bay to intersect US 101 near Crocker Lake in 1957 and was extended across the floating Hood Canal Bridge in 1959 to PSH 21 west of Port Gamble prior to the bridge opening on August 12, 1961. SR 104 was designated over the highways in 1964 and was signed into law in 1970. The highway was widened and relocated onto a limited- access bypass between downtown Edmonds and Aurora Village in 1974, at a cost of $8 million. The Hood Canal Bridge, officially named after William A. Bugge, sank during the February 13, 1979 windstorm and was replaced by a ferry operating between Lofall and South Point until the west span was re-opened on October 23, 1982. The east span of the bridge was replaced between 1997 and 2010, closing the bridge to traffic in May 2009 and re-opening the South Point-Lofall ferry. The route of the highway has not been revised significantly since the 1994 inclusion of ferry routes. The Edmonds‚ÄìKingston ferry, added to SR 104 in 1994, was first served by the 14-car and 76-passenger City of Edmonds in 1923. The ferry ran three crossings on weekdays and six on weekends and a toll of $1.50 for vehicles and $0.25 for passengers was later charged. After the establishment of Washington State Ferries in 1951, the 59-car was assigned to the Edmonds-Kingston route. Between 1968 and 2005, the Evergreen State class and were used on the route, while the Steel Electric class and were used on extra summer runs. The Jumbo class and began serving the route in 2005, but sometimes are replaced by other ferries, especially during maintenance. Spur route SR 104 Spur at its western terminus, SR 99, on the Snohomish-King county line. SR 104 Spur begins its short, route as 244th Street at SR 104 on the Snohomish-King county line between Edmonds and Shoreline. 244th Street travels west on the 5-lane roadway (including a center turning lane) north of the Aurora Village shopping center to end at an intersection with Aurora Avenue, signed as SR 99. The highway was originally part of SSH 2B from 1937 to 1964 and SR 104 after the 1964 highway renumbering and was created in 2009 after SR 104 was realigned onto a new divided highway. WSDOT estimated that between 18,000 and 19,000 vehicles per day used the spur route, according to AADT data in 2011.

Australia currently only has provisions for conscription during times of war when authorised by the governor-general and approved within 90 days by both houses of parliament as outlined in the Defence Act 1903. Universal Service Scheme In 1909, the federal government of prime minister, Alfred Deakin, introduced legislation for a form of conscription for boys from 12 to 14 years of age and for youths from 18 to 20 years of age for the purposes of home defence. The legislation, which passed with the combined support of the Protectionist Party and the Australian Labor Party, did not allow soldiers to be conscripted for overseas service. Following recommendations arising from a visit to Australia by Field Marshal Kitchener to report on the country's defence readiness, the Australian Labor Party government instituted a system of compulsory military training for all males aged between 12 and 26 from 1 January 1911. John Barrett, in his study of boyhood conscription, Falling In, noted: > In 1911 there were approximately 350,000 boys of an age (10‚Äì17 years) to > register for compulsory training up to the end of 1915. Since 'universal' > was a misnomer, about half that number were exempted from training, or > perhaps never registered, reducing the group to 175,000. There was quite extensive opposition to so-called \\"boy conscription\\". By July 1915, there had been about 34,000 prosecutions and 7,000 detentions of trainees, parents, employers, or other persons required to register. World War I Supporters of conscription campaigning at Mingenew, Western Australia in 1917 Industrial Workers of the World anti-conscription poster, 1916 Under Labor prime minister Billy Hughes, full conscription for overseas service was attempted during WWI through two plebiscites. The first plebiscite was held on 28 October 1916 and narrowly rejected conscription with a margin of 49% for and 51% against. The plebiscite of 28 October 1916 asked Australians: > Are you in favour of the Government having, in this grave emergency, the > same compulsory powers over citizens in regard to requiring their military > service, for the term of this War, outside the Commonwealth, as it now has > in regard to military service within the Commonwealth? A second plebiscite was held on 20 December 1917 and defeated by 46% for and 54% against. The question put to Australians was: > Are you in favour of the proposal of the Commonwealth Government for > reinforcing the Commonwealth Forces overseas? After the failure of the first plebiscite, Billy Hughes and his supporters left the Australian Labor Party parliamentary caucus, taking with them a good deal of the parliamentary party's talent.The Australian Century, Robert Manne They created a new National Labor Party, and Hughes survived as prime minister by forming a conservative Nationalist government, dependent for survival on the Commonwealth Liberal Party.Caucus minutes of 14 November 1916 in A Documentary History of the Australian Labor Movement 1850‚Äì1975, Brian McKinley, (1979) The remainder of the Labor Party, under their new leader Frank Tudor, then expelled Hughes and all who had followed him.Robert Manne, The Australian Century Following the split, Labor stayed out of office for ten years. Cartoons such as this one, by artist Norman Lindsay, were used both for recruitment and to promote conscription After the first plebiscite the government used the War Precautions Act and the Unlawful Associations Act to arrest and prosecute anti-conscriptionists such as Tom Barker, editor of Direct Action and many other members of the Industrial Workers of the World and E. H. Coombe (who had three sons at the front) of the Daily Herald. The young John Curtin, at the time a member of the Victorian Socialist Party, was also arrested. Anti-conscriptionist publications (in one case, even when read into Hansard), were seized by government censors in police raids.Frank Cain, The Wobblies at War: A History of the IWW and the Great War in Australia (Melbourne: Spectrum Publications, 1993) 1917 Handbill ‚Äì The Blood Vote Other notable opponents to Conscription included the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne Daniel Mannix, the Queensland Labor Premier Thomas Ryan, Vida Goldstein and the Women's Peace Army. Most trade unions actively opposed conscription. The County Cork born Archbishop Mannix stated that Ireland had been more wronged by Great Britain than Belgium had been by Germany.The Argus 9 November 1916 quoted on page 80 Ashton, Paul & Anderson, Mark Australia in the 20th Century: Working Historically Macmillan Education AU, 1 December 2004 Many people thought positively of conscription as a sign of loyalty to Britain and thought that it would also support those men who were already fighting. However, trade unions feared that their members might be replaced by cheaper foreign or female labour and opposed conscription. Some groups argued that the whole war was immoral, and it was unjust to force people to fight. South Africa and India were the only other participating countries not to introduce conscription during the First World War. =A divided nation= The conscription issue deeply divided Australia with large meetings held both for and against. The women's vote was seen as important, with large women's meetings and campaign information from both sides aimed at women voters. The campaigning for the first plebiscite was launched by Hughes at a huge overflow meeting at the Sydney Town Hall where he outlined the Government's proposals.The Age, 19 September 1916 This was followed by a huge pro- conscription meeting at the Melbourne Town Hall on 21 September.The Age, 22 September 1916 Anti-conscriptionists, especially in Melbourne, were also able to mobilise large crowds with a meeting filling the Exhibition Building on 20 September 1916;The Age, 21 September 1916 30,000 people on the Yarra bank on Sunday, 15 October,The Age, 16 October 1916 and 25,000 the following week;The Age, 23 October 1916 a \\"parade of women promoted by the United Women's No- Conscription Committee ‚Äì an immense crowd of about 60,000 people gathered at Swanston St between Guild Hall and Princes Bridge, and for upwards of an hour the street was a surging area of humanity\\". An anti-conscription stop work meeting called by five trade unions held on the Yarra Bank mid-week on 4 October attracted 15,000 people.The Age, 5 October 1916 It was passed on 21 September 1916 and mandatory registration and enrolment commenced while the first plebiscite campaign was underway. By 5 October The Age reported that of 11607 men examined, 4581 were found fit, approximately 40 percent. The Age noted, in the article \\"Influence of the IWW\\", that \\"the great bulk of the opposition to conscription is centred in Victoria\\".\\"Influence of IWW\\", The Age, 12 October 1916 Many meetings in inner Melbourne and Sydney were disrupted by anti-conscriptionists with speakers being howled down from the audience in what The Age described as \\"disgraceful exhibition\\" and \\"disorderly scenes\\".\\"Meeting at Collingwood Town Hall\\", The Age, 7 October 1916; \\"Meeting at South Melbourne\\", The Age, 9 October 1916; \\"Women's Only Meeting at Fitzroy Town Hall\\", The Age, 11 October 1916 The issue deeply divided the Labor Party, with ministers such as Hughes and George Pearce, vigorously arguing the need for conscription for Australia to help the Allies win the war. They were supported by many within the party, including Labor's first prime minister, Chris Watson and the NSW Labor Premier, William Holman. Hughes denounced anti- conscriptionists as traitors and a climate of bitter sectarianism (with most Roman Catholics opposing conscription and most others supporting it) developed. By the end of the war in November 1918, a total of 416,809 men had voluntarily enlisted in the Army, representing 38.7 percent of the white male population aged between 18 and 44.Fleming (2012). pp. 40‚Äì41. On 1 November 1929, the mandatory service provisions of the Defence Act were suspended and after 18 years conscription for home defence had come to an end. World War II In 1939, at the start of World War II, all unmarried men aged 21 were to be called up for three months' military training. These men could serve only in Australia or its territories. Conscription was effectively introduced in mid-1942, when all men aged 18‚Äì35, and single men aged 35‚Äì45, were required to join the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). Volunteers with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) scorned CMF conscripts as \\"chocolate soldiers\\", or \\"chockos\\", because they were believed to melt under the conditions of battle. Or it might be an allusion to George Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man, where Bluntschli filled his backpack with chocolate bars rather than ammunition. However, several CMF Militia units fought under difficult conditions and suffered extremely high casualties during 1942, in slowing the Japanese advance on the Kokoda Track in New Guinea (at the time an Australian territory). The Papuan campaign of 1942 led to a significant reform in the composition of the Australian Army. During the campaign, the restriction banning CMF personnel from serving outside of Australian territory hampered military planning and caused tensions between the AIF and CMF. In late 1942 and early 1943 Prime Minister John Curtin overcame opposition within the Australian Labor Party to extending the geographic boundaries in which conscripts could serve to include most of the South West Pacific and the necessary legislation was passed in January 1943.Beaumont (1996a). pp. 41‚Äì42. The 11th Brigade was the only CMF formation to serve outside of Australian territory, however, when it formed part of Merauke Force in the Dutch East Indies during 1943 and 1944.Johnston (2007). p. 8. National service in the 1950s In 1951, during the Korean War, national service was introduced under the National Service Act 1951. All Australian males aged 18 had to register for 176 days training (ninety-nine days full-time) and two years in the CMF. Later the obligation was 140 days of training (seventy-seven days full-time) and three years of service in the CMF. The regular military forces were kept as voluntary. In 1957 the system was changed to emphasise skill rather than numbers. The system was ended in 1959.Fact Sheet 163 ‚Äì National Service, 1951‚Äì59 National Archives of Australia National service from the 1960s =Vietnam War= In 1964 compulsory national service for 20-year-old males was introduced under the National Service Act 1964. The selection of conscripts was made by a sortition or lottery draw based on date of birth, and conscripts were obligated to give two years' continuous full-time service, followed by a further three years on the active reserve list. The full-time service requirement was reduced to 18 months in October 1971.Encyclopedia Appendix: The national service scheme, 1964‚Äì72 by Sue Langford. Australian War Memorial. Accessed 25 October 2019 The Defence Act was amended May 1964 to provide that national servicemen could be obliged to serve overseas, a provision that had been applied only once before, during World War II. The 1964 amendments applied only to the permanent military forces and excluded the Citizen Military Forces. In 1965, the Defence Act was again amended to require the CMF to serve overseas which was not included in the 1964 amendments.Defence Act No. 51 of 1965 Section 50C In March 1966, the government announced that national servicemen would be sent to South Vietnam to fight in units of the Australian Regular Army and for secondment to American forces.C of A Hansard 8 March 1966 Requirements for overseas service were detailed by the Minister for the Army, Malcolm Fraser, on 13 May 1966.C of A Hansard 13 May 1966 Men who wished to avoid national service could join the Citizen Military Forces and serve only inside Australia, claim a student deferment, or attempt a conscientious objection application. To be exempted on the basis of conscientious objection, an applicant needed to demonstrate his moral objection to \\"all\\" wars in court and be legalised as a pacifist. This meant that the rate of success for conscientious objection applications was generally low. During the late 1960s, domestic opposition to the Vietnam War and conscription grew in Australia. In 1965 a group of concerned Australian women formed the anti-conscription organisation Save Our Sons, which was established in Sydney with other branches later formed in Wollongong, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Newcastle and Adelaide. The movement protested against conscription of Australians to fight in the Vietnam War and made the plight of men under 21 (who were not eligible to vote at that time) a focus of their campaign. In 1970, five Save-Our-Sons women were jailed in Melbourne for handing out anti-conscription pamphlets whilst on government property. The group, which included Jean Maclean, Irene Miller and Jo Maclaine-Ross, was dubbed \\"The Fairlea Five\\" after Fairlea women's prison in which they were incarcerated.Save Our Sons Movement (1965‚Äì1973) Australian Women's Archive Project. Barbara Miller is understood to be related to the decorated conscript Simon Anderson who mysteriously disappeared in 1970. Five national servicemen assigned to the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment shortly before they and the battalion were deployed to South Vietnam in 1966 Young men who were subject to the conscription lottery also formed their own anti-conscription organisation, the Youth Campaign Against Conscription. Like Save Our Sons, it spread to other states ‚Äì New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. It was the YCAC that imported the concept of draft-card burning from the United States, and ushered in a new form of resistance to conscription ‚Äì active non-compliance. Instead of merely not registering (passive non-compliance with the National Service Scheme), these young conscripts actively demonstrated their distaste for the government's actions by destroying their registration cards. Unlike in the United States, this was not an illegal act, so its importance remained symbolic. There were several high-profile controversies caused by the government's heavy-handed treatment of conscientious objectors, including William White and Simon Townsend (who later became a well-known TV personality). In 1969 the Gorton administration was severely embarrassed by a renowned This Day Tonight story in which a conscientious objector, who had been on the run from police for several months, was interviewed live in the studio by journalist Richard Carleton, who then posed awkward questions to the Army minister about why TDT had been able to locate the man within hours and bring him to the studio when the federal police had been unable to capture him, and the event was made even more embarrassing for the government because the man was able to leave the studio before police arrived to arrest him. By 1969 public opinion was turning against the war. A Gallup Poll in August showed that 55 percent of those surveyed favoured bringing Australian troops home, and only 40 percent favoured them staying. This was the first poll to show less than 50% approval for the government's policy, and all polls after August 1969 were to reveal a majority in favour of bringing the troops home. In October, during his policy speech for the 1969 federal elections, Opposition leader Gough Whitlam declared that, if elected, the ALP would make sure that all Australian troops in Vietnam would be home 'by Christmas'.Whitlam's 1969 Election Policy Speech At around this time, too, opposition to conscription became more radical. Active non-compliers began to call themselves \\"draft resisters\\". Instead of waiting to be called up, draft resisters wrote letters to the Minister for National Service detailing their intention not to comply with conscription. Under law, this immediately rendered them liable for service. A number of these young men formed a draft resisters' union, active in at least two states ‚Äì New South Wales and Victoria. They included men such as Bob Scates and Michael Hamel-Green. They went underground while maintaining a public presence, appearing at protests and being spirited away by the crowd before they could be arrested. Australian government cabinet documents released by Australian National Archives in 2001 show that in 1970 the conservative Government was initially concerned about the growth of conscientious objection and outright opposition to the National Service Act. Reportedly, federal cabinet considered instituting an option of alternative civilian work program for conscientious objectors in an attempt to reduce the numbers of objectors going to jail. This was never instituted, but was widely rumoured at the time. Such work would have been menial labouring jobs in remote locations such as north and western Queensland, western New South Wales and northern South Australia.Cabinet Submission Number 200 for 1970 Appendix 2 ‚Äì Possible Civilian Employment analysed in Australian Draft Resistance and the Vietnam War ‚Äì statements by Michael Matteson and Geoff Mullen In Cabinet Submission Number 200 for 1970, Appendix 1,Cabinet Submission Number 200 Appendix 1 ‚Äì Men awaiting prosecution action for failure to undertake service analysed in Australian Draft Resistance and the Vietnam War ‚Äì statements by Michael Matteson and Geoff Mullen case studies of 17 men awaiting prosecution for failure to undertake service show a broad spectrum of opposition to conscription including: * Religious opposition - for example, Christadelphians, Jehovah's Witnesses * Moral opposition to wars * Moral opposition to the Vietnam War in particular * Opposition based upon the compulsion and authoritarian nature of conscription and its conflict with democratic processes and ideals. The documents reveal that draft resistance and draft dodging never posed a threat to the number of conscripts required, but the public opposition by draft resisters such as John Zarb, Michael Matteson and Robert Martin did have an increasingly political effect. Conscription ended in December 1972 and the remaining seven men in Australian prisons for refusing conscription were freed in mid-to-late December 1972. 63,735 national servicemen served in the Army, of whom 15,381 were deployed to Vietnam. Approximately 200 were killed.

The postal history of Portuguese India goes back to the earlier days of the colony. The postal history begins with communication between the Viceroy and the Court at Lisbon soon after the conquest of Old Goa by Afonso de Albuquerque in 1510. Letters, written in triplicate, were carried by separate ships because of the hazards of the voyage. Mail was carried by an overland route, as well.

Portuguese Indian postmarks are known from 1854, when a post office opened in Goa and an extraterritorial British East India Company post office opened in Damaun. A Portuguese Indian post office opened at Diu, also, in 1880. The British East India Company post office in Damaun, selling British Indian stamps, was maintained between 1854 and November, 1883.

These were issued for local use within the colony. Stamps of British India were required for overseas mail. The design of these first stamps simply consisted of a denomination in the center, with an oval band containing the inscriptions \\"SERVI√áO POSTAL\\" and \\"INDIA PORT.\\". The dies were recut several times and printed on several kinds of paper, resulting in an extremely complicated situation that has been intensively studied; about 55 types have been identified as appearing between 1871 and 1877, some of which are quite rare. Regular issues In 1877, Portugal included India in its standard \\"crown\\" issue, with nine values ranging from 5r to 300r. These stamps ran out in 1881 and the old local stamps were surcharged with various values, resulting in nearly 100 distinct types. Additional \\"crown\\" stamps arrived in 1882, but in the following year were supplemented by additional values of the original local design. From 1886 on, the pattern of regular stamp issues followed that of the other colonies closely, the main exception being a series of surcharges in 1912 produced by perforating existing stamps vertically through the middle and overprinting a new value on each side. In 1925, a commemorative stamp marked the 400th anniversary of the death of Vasco da Gama and in December 1931 a set of six promoted the Exposition of St. Francis Xavier held at Goa. Sets of stamps in 1946 and 1948 commemorated notable historical figures related to the colony. Portuguese India's first stamp exhibition, in 1952, was commemorated with a pair of stamps; one reproducing the design of the first issue, the other depicting St. Francis Xavier. A definitive series in 1956 commemorated the 450th anniversary of Portuguese settlements in India, and included portraits and maps of old forts, while a 1959 series depicted various coins. Last stamps The last regular issue was on 25 June 1960, marking the 500th anniversary of the death of Prince Henry the Navigator. Stamps of India were first used 29 December 1961, although the old stamps were accepted until 5 January 1962. Portugal continued to issue stamps for the lost colony, yet none of these were ever offered for sale in the colony's post offices and are thus not considered valid stamps. The territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli were liberated from Portuguese rule in 1954, and they enjoyed de facto independence until being formally incorporated into India after the Annexation of Goa in 1961. During these years, mail from Dadra and Nagar Haveli was routed through the Indian town of Vapi close to the border. Initially, remaining stocks of stamps of Portuguese India were overprinted LIBERATED AREAS in two lines.

The highway travels east to interchange with (I-5), where the northbound ramps are accessed through nearby 5th Avenue Northeast. After the I-5 interchange, the road forms the northern boundary of the Jackson Park Golf Course and later continues to at the northern Seattle, southern Shoreline and western Lake Forest Park city limits. The SR 523 / I-5 interchange was used by an estimated 28,000 motorists daily based on average annual daily traffic (AADT) data collected by the Washington State Department of Transportation. History The Washington State Legislature first established a state-maintained highway on a section of present-day SR 523 in 1937, with the establishment of (SSH 1J), which ran from Downtown Seattle to (PSH 1) in North Seattle, via the current long section of SR 523 from I-5 to 5th Avenue Northeast. During the 1964 highway renumbering, SSH 1J became and PSH 1 became I-5; the northern terminus of SR 513 became the current SR 523 / I-5 interchange. In 1991, the northern terminus of SR 513 was moved south to its current location, Magnuson Park and SR 523 was established.

They are known in Thai as (, lit. \\"television drama\\") or (lakhon, , or lakorn). They are shown generally at prime-time on Thai television channels, starting at 20:30. (after 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat on Friday nights the lakhorns is interrupted, or broadcast on delay, due to simulcast of The Government-required Weekly Address by the Prime Minister of Thailand. the lakhorns resumed already in progress after Weekly Address is ended on 21:00 or 20:50 or later in some nights until July 2019 that governmental program ended after five years before the sworn in of new cabinet after 2019 Thai general election.) An episode of a prime-time drama is two hours long including commercials. Each series is a finished story, unlike Western \\"cliffhanger\\" dramas, but rather like Hispanic telenovelas. A series will run for about three months. It may air two or three episodes a week, the pattern being Monday‚ÄìTuesday, Wednesday‚ÄìThursday, or Friday‚ÄìSunday. A channel will air three soap operas simultaneously at any given time (each producing their own series). Channels will compete for the most popular stars as they attract the most viewers. Some examples are Channel 3, 5 and 7 as well to a lesser extent Channel 9. While the \\"best\\" series are shown at night right after the news, the ones with a smaller profiles (and shorter run time) will be shown in the evenings from 17:00‚Äì18:00. In some cases, the most popular prime-time series are shown on re-runs a couple of years after their initial release, generally in the afternoon. A lakorn episode is normally 1 hour and a small amount or 30 minutes. When internationally broadcast, the running time is around 45 min. per episode.  Characters  Thai soap operas have very distinctive, though formulaic, characters, and narrative conventions. Though some stray from these conventions, most adhere to them, especially ones that are very popular among Thai viewers. * The series' main goal is to achieve a perfect ending where the lead characters marry their soulmates, and live happily ever after. * The two main lovers are established at the beginning of the story. Viewers will have no difficulties at singling them out from the crowd. They tend to be the most popular soap opera stars at the moment. The male lead role is called Phra Ek (‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏Å), and the lead female role is called Nang Ek (‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏Å). * The presence of at least one female antagonist, sometimes more, is commonplace. This person is completely in love with the male lead, and will do anything necessary to stop the two would-be lovers from fulfilling their fairy tale ending. She does everything in her power to become the main actor's girlfriend, and continually attempts to get rid of main actress. She is often a stereotypical character who does not hesitate to do very bad things to the main actress, including trying to steal her boyfriend before the wedding. She is often a rich girl, comes from a good background, has a nasty behaviour, and is manipulative. Few of these characters are kind. She is usually a living person, but a few of these characters can be evil, dead women who come back as ghosts. The most popular ones are Poot Mae Nam Khong or the remake of Pob Pee Fa. Nang Rai or Nang Itcha (‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏≠‡∏¥‡∏à‡∏â‡∏≤) is a famous name for Thai viewers. * \\"LGBT characters are often used as comic relief. Sapai Look Tung is popular for this role. * In the end, all conflicts in the story must be resolved. Everyone forgives each other. The antagonists receive their punishments, and the good characters receive their rewards. However, some series end with unsolvable problems such as Poot Mae Nam Khong. * Thai soap operas are often melodramatic to the point of becoming camp. Most productions are written and produced with the assumption that the more melodramatic it is, the better. This is why situations are grossly exaggerated, actions are overly theatrical, and screams and shrieks (from the female antagonists) numerous. Criticism  Because Thai soap operas present a melodramatic story line featuring simple one- dimensional characterizations to capture the broadest viewership and commercial sponsorship, they generally do not foster critical insight, reasoning, or problem-solving skills, nor a multi-perspective consideration of the human drama being viewed. They are simply an attempt to create dramatic tension and a \\"showdown\\" between the protagonist(s) and antagonist(s). Several series adhere to this simple format which, over an extended period, may cause some viewers to develop a skewed view of reality. At least one critic contends that the recent political problems in Thailand may be at least partially attributable to the negative influence of soap operas, surmising that it is the disregard of common sense and common human wisdom that causes people to shy away from thinking critically and, as a result, becoming prone to manipulation. In 2008, Thai Airways flight attendants urged the government to remove a prime-time TV drama (Songkhram Nang Fah) because it showed women flight attendants in short-skirted uniforms fighting over a male pilot. They complained the soap opera portrayed their job in a negative light. In 2010, at a seminar held by the Christian Council of Thailand, issues were raised involving Thai soap operas and the television rating system. The most notable issues were that Thai soap operas are broadcast early in the day and may including content unsuitable for children, such as graphic or violent sexual assault scenes. In Thai soap operas, rape is often shown as a vehicle for revenge or a path to true love. Critics have called for producers to stop romanticizing the crime as it feeds into the country's culture of gender inequality. A study by the Thai Health Promotion Foundation found that 80 percent of Thai soap operas depicted rape or sexual violence in 2014. Characters who commit sexual violence are rarely held to account and often win the heart of their victim. Directors and producers are often reluctant to change because soap operas depicting sexual violence, nicknamed \\"slap and kiss\\", have consistently resulted in higher ratings. \\"Most television soap operas are adapted from famous old novels containing rape storylines in which female protagonists are raped by male protagonists,\\" says Jaray Singhakowinta, professor of sexuality studies at Bangkok's National Institute of Development Administration. \\"Some of them are so popular that they have been made into movies and television soap operas more than 10 times since the 1970s.\\" According to Thailand's National Research Institute, about 30,000 rape cases are reported each year. The head of the Teeranat Kanjanauaksorn Foundation, a gender equality group, has suggested that the real number is probably 10 times official figures, as most rape cases never reach the legal system.  Evolution  Most Thai soap operas portray the upper class of Thai society, usually through the male lead, but sometimes from both leads. The male lead is usually rich, like Phak in Dao pra sook. Early on, the male leads were nobility, usually junior princes, such as a Mom Chao, because, back then, these were the rich people in Thai society. The rich male has since evolved into businessmen from influential families. This change mirrors the change in Thai society with the upper class now filled with business people and not so much from the royal and noble classes.  Novel adaptations  Most, if not all, Thai soap operas are based upon novels. Romance abounds in Thai literature scenes and most have the perfect boy-meets-girl scenario. The ever famous, Dao pra sook, is also a novel while another 1994's Silamanee was clearly inspired by the novel of the same name.  Folk stories  Thai television soap operas have contributed to popularize the spirits and legends of the folklore of Thailand. Some soap operas, such as \\"Raeng Ngao\\", include the popular ghosts in Thai culture interacting with the living, while others are based on traditional Thai legends and folk tales such as \\"Nang Sib Song\\", \\"Kaki\\" and \\"Thep Sarm Rudoo\\".  Actors  Actors and actresses, referred to in Thai language as dara (stars) , are usually cast in the same roles over and over again. An actress who plays the lead female would assume the same role. Suvanant Kongying still plays the female lead. The same goes for other roles, such as the friend of the main leads, the bad characters, the servant characters, the mother characters, and others. An \\"upgrade\\" or \\"downgrade\\" does occur, such as when a female lead assumes the role of the mother, but this is rare. Sornram Teppitak still plays the leading male character. Kob Suvanant Kongying and Num Sornram Theppitak were the highest paid TV actress and actor in Thailand in the 1990s. However, in the past 10 years a new actress has reigned as highest paid in Thailand, Pachrapa Chaichua of channel 7 and Ann Thongprasom of channel 3. This trend causes problems for the female actors in the leading roles as they age. Thai audiences seem to like their leads young and beautiful and many past female daras have disappeared from the screen once they reach the age of 30 or so. A few defy this norm, such as Marsha Wattanapanich and, even then, she is gradually disappearing. Her latest TV series was 2002's Baung Ban Ja Torn (The Enchanted Bed), which became top rated. This problem is not as bad for male actors, as can be seen in the prolific career of veteran actor Chatchai Plengpanich. His wife, the once famous Sinjai Plengpanich, has all but disappeared, except for the few commercials seen in primetime. Among the younger crowd are leading actresses such as Usamanee Waitayanon and Khemanit \\"Pancake\\" Jamikorn who have continued to grab ratings despite their ongoing feud.Ongoing Feud , Tina's Thai All Star Blog. Waitayanon and Jamikorn have come out numerous of times to deny that there is any feuding, but actions prove otherwise. Due to their behavior it is rumored that executives for channel 7, such as Khun Daeng, have called for the women to be disciplined. Waitayanon and Jamikorn have been given a high spotlight due to their feuds and their romantic links to other celebrities such as Golf, a famous singer from the duo better known as Golf Mike. Jamikorn has been linked to romantic interests, including leading actor Sukollawat \\"Weir\\" Kanarot.  Law  Thailand has strict censorship laws on films containing nudity, sexual intercourse, smoking opium, or which might offend religious sensibilities. There are no classifications to rate films for different ages so censors often obscure scenes by scratching the celluloid or smudging it with a translucent gel. When actors are playing cards in TV series, a sentence displays that playing cards with money is forbidden by the law. On Thai television, Chinese, Japanese, American, and Indian films are broadcast. No sex is shown on Thai television, but violence is not uncommon. A rare censorship appeared in Talay Rissaya when a character's throat got slit with blood everywhere. Some series are subject to a rating. Most of BBTV Channel 7 programs are usually rated as G-18 (children under 18 should seek parental guidance).  International broadcasts  Thai TV soap operas are popular overseas in countries such as Cambodia and Laos. Several Cambodian television channels aired Thai soap operas instead of their local ones. Dao Pra Sook was the most popular series for Khmer viewers. Thai lakorn were banned in early‚Äì2003. The sale of Thai soap operas is still allowed in Cambodia, but television stations do not air them. Thai TV soap operas have begun to become popular in Singapore as Nang Tard aired successfully in that country. They are broadcast in Singapore one or two weeks after airing in Thailand. Malaysia used to broadcast some Thai soaps with considerable success, but currently Thai soap operas are almost absent on local television, but are sold on DVDs two to three months after being broadcast on Thai television. Vietnam's VTV1 broadcasts Thai soap operas one day after showing in Thailand, usually not dubbed or subtitled. However, Thai TV soap operas have begun to become popular in Vietnam as Song Kram Nang Fah aired successfully in that country. According to China Radio International, many Thai soap operas are aired in China, dubbed into Chinese language, mostly on Anhui Television. Thai soap operas were also broadcast in the Philippines for a short while in 1998, but were cancelled due to low ratings. You're My Destiny is the first lakorn to appear in the Philippines in 20 years. It aired on GMA Network as part of Heart of Asia's 15th anniversary offering. It is also the first lakorn to be part of the Heart of Asia block. Thai soap operas are available in Nepal alongside English language, Hindi, Korean and Chinese dramas. Thai soap operas are available to stream with subtitles on Iflix in Sri Lanka. Recently, a historical romantic drama set in the Ayutthaya Kingdom Love Destiny (2018) became hit across countries including Russiahttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-politics-costume/venerating- the-past-traditional-costume-fever-grips-thailand-idUSKBN1HF04S  Genre  Each series incorporates various dramatic elements such as horror or comedic sub-plots. However, due to the popularity of love stories, all series feature a love story. None do not.  Remakes  Since the late‚Äì1990s, Thai soap operas are often remakes of old series, but with new actors and minor modifications to their plots. To add spice to older themes, producers add supplementary sex, violence, and vulgarity. The tradition of remakes in Thai soap operas began with the successful lakrons. Shows that have been redone include 1995's Sai Lohit (\\"Bloodline\\") starring Sornram Teppitak and Suvanant Kongying which was then followed by Prissana in 2000. Dao Pra Sook also had a remake in 2002. In early‚Äì2000, horror-genre soap operas made a comeback with a remake of Tayat Asoon, a witch and black magic soap opera starring Sinjai Plengpanich. Other recent remakes, Poot Pee Saward, Poot Mae Nam Khong, and Susan Khon Pen, combine both love and ghost stories. Remakes of Pob Pee Fa and Dome Tong have been announced. A 2008 remake of the 1994 series, Silamanee, became a hit and generated a positive response from audiences. Its attraction was due to new costume designs and the lead actress, Suvanant Kongying. It was called the most beautiful series of the year.  Sequel  All soap opera series do not have another season but may be followed by sequel. The Thai hit series, Girl in The Glass Lamp, based on Indian legend Aladdin, had a sequel but with different casting. This series found as only sequel until 2000's hit, Angkor, released its sequel in the late of 2006. Meanwhile, a remake of Poot Mae Nam Khong is planning to produce a sequel after the question for audience appeared on its ending. One of the highest rating series of all time, Kom Faek now announced its sequel as well. Sawan Biang is one of the two series with the highest rating of all time. The lakorn's leads were played by the talented Ann Thongprasom and Ken Theeradeth, although no sequel is in sight.  Records  *Khu Kam was based on novel of the same name by Thommayanti, starring pop star Thongchai McIntyre and Kamolchanok Komoltithi, broadcast on Channel 7 in early 1990. It created the phenomenon by being the highest rated drama in the Thai television industry with ratings up to 40 to this day. In addition to this, the main theme song of the drama Peerapong Polchana and Kamolchanok Komoltithi became a major hit and remains popular to this day. *Dao Pra Sook became the most popular series in the 1990s and one of the first of leading the Thai soap opera reputation into aboard screen within the highest rate drama at 1994 including several foreign release. The highest rated country after Thailand, is Cambodia with giving the nickname for Suvanant Kongying as the morning star as well as the title of the series. *Susan Khon Pen is a series which mostly remake as at least three times just in only one channel. *Sisa Marn is noted the scariest series along with Pob Pee Fa and Tayat Asoon. *In 2008, Kom Faek set the record for the highest rated Thai soap opera in history as well as for Channel 7, with almost 15 million viewers. :t-pegeat.

Spy published in Vanity Fair in 1903. William James Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie, KP, PC, PC (Ire) (31 May 1847 ‚Äì 7 June 1924), was a leading British shipbuilder and businessman. He was chairman of Harland and Wolff, shipbuilders, between 1895 and 1924, and also served as Lord Mayor of Belfast between 1896 and 1898. He was ennobled as Baron Pirrie in 1906, appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick in 1908 and made Viscount Pirrie in 1921. In the months leading up to the 1912 disaster, Lord Pirrie was questioned about the number of life boats aboard the Olympic-class ships. He responded that the great ships were unsinkable and the rafts were to save others. This would haunt him forever. Background Pirrie was born in Quebec City, Canada East, the son of James Alexander Pirrie and Eliza Swan (Montgomery) Pirrie, who were both Irish.thepeerage.com William James Pirrie, 1st and last Viscount Pirrie He was taken back to Ireland when he was two years old and spent his childhood at Conlig, County Down.

Pirrie was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution before entering Harland and Wolff shipyard as a gentleman apprentice in 1862. Twelve years later he was made a partner in the firm, and on the death of Sir Edward Harland in 1895 he became its chairman, a position he was to hold until his death. As well as overseeing the world's largest shipyard, Pirrie was elected Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1896, and was re-elected to the office as well as made an Irish Privy Counsellor the following year. He became Belfast's first honorary freeman in 1898, and served in the same year as High Sheriff of Antrim and subsequently of County Down. In February 1900 he was elected President of the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom, where he had been vice-president the previous year. He helped finance the Liberals in Ulster in the 1906 general election, and that same year, at the height of Harland and Wolff's success, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Pirrie, of the City of Belfast. The following year he was appointed Comptroller of the Household to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and in 1908 he was appointed Knight of St Patrick (KP). Lord Pirrie was jeered in the streets after chairing a famous meeting of the Ulster Liberal Association addressed by Winston Churchill. That same year he was to travel aboard the , but illness prevented him from joining the ill-fated passage. Pro-Chancellor of The Queen's University of Belfast from 1908 to 1914, Lord Pirrie was also in the years before the First World War a member of the Committee on Irish Finance as well as Lieutenant for the City of Belfast (both 1911).

It is similar to the Japanese naginata, the Chinese guandao and pudao, the Korean woldo, the Russian sovnya and the Siberian . Overview Typically, the blade is around long, on the end of a pole long, and the blade is affixed in a socket-shaft configuration similar to an axe head, rather than having a tang like a sword or naginata. Occasionally, glaive blades were created with a small hook on the reverse side to better catch riders. Such blades are called glaive-guisarmes. According to the 1599 treatise Paradoxes of Defence by the English gentleman George Silver, the glaive is used in the same general manner as the quarterstaff, half pike, bill, halberd, voulge, or partisan. Silver rated this class of polearms above all other individual hand-to-hand combat weapons. Image taken from the Morgan Bible (Folio 10 Verso ‚Äì top). Notice the Warbrand in the forefront slicing into a mounted soldier. The Maciejowski Bible (Morgan Bible) depicts an example of a two-handed glaive used on horseback. The contemporary term for this weapon may have been faussart, which was used for a variety of single-edged weapons seen as related to the scythe (along with terms such as falchion, falcata, or fauchard derived from falx, the Latin term for \\"scythe\\"). Other uses of the word The word \\"glaive\\" has historically been given to several very different types of weapons. * The word \\"glaive\\" originated from French. Almost all etymologists derive it from either the Latin (gladius) or Celtic (*cladivos, cf. claymore) word for sword. Nevertheless, all the earliest attestations in both French and English refer to spears.OED s.v. Glaive: \\"Hatz-Darm. regard OF. glaive as an adapted form of L. gladius (through the stages gladie, glaie, glavie).

It was the first camera to feature both integrated autofocus (AF) and motorised film advance, the standard configuration for later amateur and professional single lens reflex cameras. Overview Although the Nikon F3AF (1983), Pentax ME F and Chinon CE-5 already had presented autofocus single lens reflex cameras, autofocusing could not be achieved without the use of special motorised AF lenses. The Pentax ME F had focus sensors in the camera body, while the Chinon CE-5 used a lens with built-in active infrared sensors. Nikon already had a camera with integrated motor drive on the market, the N2000 (F-301 in UK), but its autofocus counterpart, the N2020 (F-501 in UK), appeared after the Maxxum/Dynax. The Minolta 7000 had its AF sensors and the focusing drive inside the camera body, and as a result the lenses could be much smaller and cheaper. The aperture and focus were mechanically driven through the lens mount from the camera body. However, electronically controlled buttons on the camera body now replaced the mechanical aperture ring on the lens, and the setting was electronically displayed on the body and in the viewfinder. The metal housing of older Minolta SLR cameras was replaced with a lighter, cheaper body made of plastics. In other respects, the Maxxum offered most of the standard features of other cameras of the day, with the exception of a rather low flash sync speed (1/125 sec.) and no multi-exposure capability. Minolta introduced a new lens mount, the A system, breaking compatibility with its earlier manual-focus lenses in the MC and MD system. The A lens mount is still the same today, but some modifications have been made to the electronic contacts to facilitate new functions such as motor zoom (xi lenses, now discontinued) and a more sophisticated flash metering system (ADI). Konica and Minolta merged their photo and camera businesses in October 2003. In January 2006 Konica Minolta announced that they were withdrawing from the camera and photo business, transferring their assets to Sony, who since have continued development of the A system through their Alpha series. Autofocus Maxxum 7000 next to a Maxxum/Dynax 7 When Pentax and Nikon entered the autofocus segment, both used a similar passive array AF system as Minolta, but retained compatibility with their existing manual-focus K and F mounts respectively. Canon, like Minolta, chose to change its mount completely, introducing the EOS 600-series a few years later, breaking compatibility with the former FL and FD lens mounts. Canon's EOS system was the only fully electronic lens mount system, with no mechanical connections between camera body and lens: the autofocus motors were housed in the lens itself, rather than the camera body.

All Maxxum cameras produced thereafter had a regularly scripted double 'X'. Minolta's autofocus design was found to infringe the patents of Honeywell, a U.S. corporation. After protracted litigation, Minolta in 1991 was ordered to pay Honeywell damages, penalties, trial costs and other expenses in a final amount of $127.6 million.Minolta Credit Rating Downgraded by Moody's, Company News/Business section, The New York Times, 11 July 1992 References External links *Maxxum 7000 at MIR Category:135 film cameras 7000 ","title":"Minolta Maxxum 7000"},{"id":"892114","text":"The Warsaw Uprising, in 1944, ended in the capitulation of the city and its near total destruction by the German forces. According to many historians, a major cause of this was the almost complete lack of outside support and the late arrival of the support which did arrive. The only support operation which ran continuously for the duration of the Uprising were night supply drops by long-range planes of the Royal Air Force (RAF), other Commonwealth air forces, and especially units of the Polish Air Force (PAF), which had to use distant airfields in Italy (Brindisi and others) and so had very limited effect. The Soviets made clear their view on the situation in Warsaw to United States Ambassador, W. Averell Harriman. On 15 August 1944, Harriman received a note from Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Vyshinsky. In this note, Vyshinsky was instructed by Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov to inform Harriman that the Soviet Government \\"could not go along\\" with US plans to airdrop arms to resistance groups in Warsaw and that the \\"action in Warsaw into which the Warsaw populations had been drawn was a purely adventuristic affair and the Soviet Government could not lend its hand to it.\\" Vyshinsky's note concluded that Stalin had pointed out to Churchill on 5 August that one could not imagine how a few Polish detachments of the so-called National Army possessing neither tanks, artillery, or aviation could \\"take\\" Warsaw when the Nazis had four tank divisions at their disposal for the defense of the city. Regardless of Stalin's political intentions, there could be alternate logistic reasons why the Soviet forces could not provide aid to Warsaw. One alternate explanation which has been given for the lack of early support is that the uprising began too early and the nearby Soviet forces could not fight their road to the city to support. Before and at the time of uprising, the German army started a massive Panzer force counterattack near Warsaw. Another possible explanation is that the Red Army was simply exhausted and hence unable to extend effective support to the Uprising. In support of this thesis, it is often claimed (mostly by Soviet sources) that since the opening of Operation Bagration many Red Army units had covered several hundred miles in a far-ranging offensive, and their advance elements were at the very end of their logistical tether. This, coupled with the presence of several Panzer divisions from the Waffen-SS and the Wehrmacht around Warsaw which administered a sharp reverse to the Soviet 2nd Tank Army in the final days of July, was, according to this view, sufficient to stop the Red Army in its tracks on the Warsaw front. However, the units which reached Warsaw in late July 1944 were not part of Bagration, but instead advanced from Western Ukraine as part of the Lublin-Brest Operation, covering a much smaller distance. Those units were in fact able to operate quite effectively against German forces to the south and north of Warsaw during August and September, successfully securing bridgeheads over the Vistula and Narew rivers in those sectors. Despite that Soviet success, they remained inactive during August and the first half of September on the most direct route of approach towards Warsaw, through the suburb of Praga. Furthermore, once the Soviet forces seized Praga in mid-September 1944, only poorly supported units of the inexperienced 1st Polish Army were assigned to attempt the crossing of the river Vistula to aid the insurgents. Those crossings failed to establish a durable foothold on the left bank of the river, and caused considerable casualties among the Polish units involved. It is an open question whether an earlier Soviet effort using more experienced units with adequate support would have been able to reach and cross the Vistula in the Warsaw sector, and provide timely and effective support to the Polish units fighting in the main part of the city. The continued difficulty in accessing Soviet and British documents of the time makes it difficult for historians to answer this question with any degree of certainty.  The airdrops  The monument shown in this photograph was erected to commemorate the Allied airmen who lost their lives over Warsaw. From August 4 the Western Allies begun supporting the Warsaw Uprising with airdrops of munitions and other supplies. Initially the air raids were carried out mostly by 1586 Polish Flight of the PAF stationed in Bari and Brindisi in Italy flying Liberators, Halifaxes and Dakotas. Later on at the insistence of the Polish government-in-exile they were joined by the Liberators of 2 Wing - 31 and 34 Squadrons of the SAAF based at Foggia in Southern Italy, and Halifaxes, flown by 148 and 178 Squadrons of the RAF. The drops continued until September 21, delivering a total of 104 tons of supplies. The Soviet Union did not give permission to the Allies for use of its airports for those supply operations and thus the planes were forced to use bases in the United Kingdom and Italy which reduced their carrying weight and number of sorties. The Allies specific request for the use of landing strips made on 20 August was denied by Stalin on 22 August. He referred to the resistance as \\"a handful of criminals\\". United States Army Air Forces planes did not join the operation. On August 6, the Polish Ambassador called on the Lt. General McNarney to present an urgent request from the president of Poland for supplies to be furnished to the Polish Underground Army fighting the Germans in Warsaw. The Polish request asked that either General Eisenhower be authorized to send in supplies by air or that German munitions captured from the enemy by Soviet forces be sent to Warsaw from the United States bases in the Soviet Union. The Ambassador's memorandum also stated that arms and ammunition which Churchill had promised to parachute to Warsaw had not been sent because of technical difficulties. A response letter from the Joint Chiefs of Staff on August 7 stated that it \\"believed the Polish Ambassador should be informed that his appeal has been given most sympathetic consideration by the United States military authorities and that the matter has been referred to the Combined Chiefs of Staff for such action as is possible under the circumstances.\\" In the annexes to the letter from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, it stated that in accordance with the agreed policy of the Combined Chiefs of Staff that supplies and equipment for the Polish Underground Forces is a British responsibility, and that the Polish request should be referred to the British Chiefs of Staff for such action as they may deem necessary and desirable. After Stalin's objections to support for the uprising, Churchill telegrammed Roosevelt on August 25 and proposed sending planes in defiance of Stalin and to 'see what happens'. Roosevelt replied on August 26: 'I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you in the proposed message to Uncle Joe'. Although German air defence over the Warsaw area itself was almost non-existent, about 12% of the 296 planes taking part in the operations were lost because they had to fly 1,600 km out over heavily defended enemy territory and then back over the same route. Most of the drops were made during night, at no more than 100‚Äì300 feet altitude, and poor accuracy left many parachuted packages stranded behind German-controlled territory. From September 13 on the Soviets began their own airdrop raids with supplies, and dropped about 55 tons in total. The drops continued until September 28. Finally on September 18 the Soviets allowed one USAAF flight of 110 B-17s of the 3 division Eighth Air Force to re-fuel and reload at Soviet airfields used in Operation Frantic, but it was too little too late. On their return flight to Foggia and then back to England the B-17's bombed the rail yards in Budapest, Hungary, which was still in German-occupied territory.  Soviet participation: Berling landings on Powi≈õle  The role of the Red Army during the Warsaw Uprising remains controversial and is still disputed by some historians. The Uprising started when the Red Army appeared on the city's doorstep, and the Poles in Warsaw were counting on Soviet aid coming in a matter of days. This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces played out successfully in a number of European capitals, notably Paris and Prague. However, despite standing for about 40 days less than 10 km from Warsaw's city center, and then moving even closer, to the right bank of the Vistula river a few hundred meters away from the main battle of the uprising during its last two weeks, the Red Army did not extend effective aid to the desperate city. Some Western historians, as well as the official line of the Communist regime in Poland before 1989, claimed that the Red Army, exhausted by its long advance on its way to Warsaw, lacked sufficient fighting power to overcome the German forces around Warsaw and extend effective aid to the Uprising. However, the consensus among most historiansNorman Davies - Europe - , p.1041 is that Stalin did not want to aid the Home Army in Warsaw, made up of likely opponents of the Communist regime that he wanted to impose on Poland after the war, and other Allied powers were reluctant to intervene against Stalin's will. The Red Army reached the outskirts of Warsaw in the final days of July, 1944. The Soviet units belonged to the 1st Belorussian Front, participating in the Lublin-Brest Operation, between the Lvov-Sandomierz Operation on its left and Operation Bagration on its right. These two operations were colossal defeats for the German army and completely destroyed a large number of German formations. As a consequence, the Germans at this time were desperately trying to put together a new force to hold the line of the Vistula river, the last major river barrier between the Red Army and Germany proper, rushing in units in various stages of readiness from all over Europe. These units included a few high quality Panzer and SS Panzer divisions pulled from their refits, but also many infantry units of poor quality. In terms of combat power this scratch force was considerably inferior to what the Soviets had available. On the other hand, after their long advances in June and July the Soviet suffered from the usual difficulties with supply accompanying any long-range Soviet offensive that has advanced far beyond its starting line. The Soviet plan was to seize bridgeheads across the Vistula and the Narew rivers as jumping off points for the next offensive and then stop to resupply their units. This put Warsaw, straddling the river Vistula, right at the limit of planned Soviet advance. From the operational viewpoint seizing Warsaw was not a major priority for the Soviets, though clearly having possession of the city would be advantageous to them, especially if it could be captured with its infrastructure intact. However, it was not essential, as the Soviets already seized a series of convenient bridgeheads to the south of Warsaw, and were concentrating on defending them against vigorous German counterattacks. The Red Army was also gearing for a major thrust into the Balkans through Romania at around this time and a large proportion of Soviet resources was being sent in that direction. In the initial Battle of Radzymin Soviet advance armored units of the 2nd Tank Army suffered a setback which prevented them from taking Warsaw from the march. It was the presence of Soviet tanks in nearby Wo≈Çomin that sealed the decision of the Home Army leaders in Warsaw to launch the uprising. As a result of the battle, the Soviet tank army was pushed out of Wo≈Çomin to the east of Warsaw and pushed back about 10 km.http://www.rkka.ru - Map of 2nd Tank Army operations around Warsaw - 1‚Äì5 August 1944 map The Soviet Conduct of Tactical Maneuver: Spearhead of the Offensive by David M Glantz. Map of the front lines on August 3, 1944 - Google book searchibid, Google book search resultMap of 2nd Tank Army operations map However, the defeat did not change the fact of the overwhelming Soviet superiority over the Germans in the sector. The Soviets retained their positions to the south-east of Warsaw along the Vistula river, barely 10 km away from the city center, at the outskirts of the Warsaw right bank suburb Praga. The Poles fighting in the Uprising were counting that the Soviet forces would seize Praga in a matter of days and then be in a position to have Red Army units cross to the left bank where the main battle of the Uprising was occurring and come to its aid. However, on that line along the outskirts of Praga, on the most direct route of advance towards Warsaw, the Soviets stopped their advance and the front line did not move for the next 45 days. The sector was held by the understrength German 73rd Infantry Division, destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and recently reconstituted.SS: The Waffen-SS War in Russia 1941-45 Relevant page viewable via Google book search The division, though weak, did not experience significant Soviet pressure during that period. At the same time, the Red Army was fighting intense battles to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north, to gain bridgeheads over the river Narew. It was on those sectors that the best Panzer and armored divisions that the Germans had were fighting. Despite that, both of these objectives have been mostly secured by early September. The inactivity of the Red Army directly in front of Warsaw elicited this reaction of amazement from Germans, recorded in the operations journal of German 9th Army on 16 August 1944: Contrary to our expectations, the enemy has halted all of their offensive actions alongside the entire front of the 9th Army. Finally, on September 11, the Soviet 47th Army began its advance into Praga. The resistance by the German 73rd Division was weak and collapsed quickly, with the Soviets gaining control of the suburb by September 14. With the taking of Praga, the Soviet forces were now directly across the river from the Uprising fighting in left-bank Warsaw. If the Soviets had reached this stage in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easy, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. By mid-September a series of German attacks had reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of Czerniakow. Nevertheless, the Soviets now made an attempt to aid the Uprising, but not by using Red Army units. In the Praga area Polish units under command of General Zygmunt Berling (thus sometimes known as 'berlingowcy' - 'the Berling men'), the 1st Polish Army (1 Armia Wojska Polskiego) were in position. On the night of September 14/September 15 three patrols from landed on the shore of Czerniak√≥w and Powi≈õle areas and made contacts with Home Army forces. Under heavy German fire only small elements of main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division). At the same time the commanders of the Red Army declined to support the Polish troops with artillery, tanks or bombers. The Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, which could seriously compromise their line of defence, but weren't able to make any significant advances for several days, while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for new expected wave of Soviet landings. Polish units from the eastern shore attempted several more landings, and during the next few days sustained heavy losses (including destruction of all landing boats and most of other river crossing equipment). Other Soviet units limited their assistance to sporadic and insignificant artillery and air support. Shortly after the Berling landings, the Soviets decide to postpone all plans for a river crossing in Warsaw \\"for at least 4 months\\" and soon afterwards general Berling was relieved of his command. On the night of September 19, after no further attempts from the other side of the river were made and the promised evacuation of wounded did not take place, Home Army soldiers and landed elements of Wojsko Polskie were forced to begin a retreat from their positions on the bank of the river. Out of approximately 3,000 men who made it ashore only around 900 made it back to the eastern shores of Vistula, approximately 600 of them seriously wounded. Closed or destroyed military archives A grave of a Royal Hungarian Army captain and 6 of his men who fell fighting on the Polish side during the Uprising (the epitaph says: \\"Here lies Honved Sergeant J√∂zef Vonyik and 6 unidentified Hungarian soldiers who fell fighting for the Polish cause during the Warsaw Uprising, August 1944\\") Research into the lack of support of the Warsaw Uprising is (according to historians such as Norman Davies) currently very difficult due to lack of access to archives. For records relating to the period, currently both the United Kingdom archives and Russian archives (where the majority of Soviet archives are kept) remain mostly closed to the public. Further complicating the matter is the United Kingdom's claim that they accidentally destroyed the archives of the Polish Government in Exile.Rising 44, Norman Davies, Pan Books, 2004, , Chapter VII: Stalinist Repression, Page 528, \\"[the post Communist Polish Government was] told that the files had been 'inadvertently destroyed'\\"; See also *Jewish partisans *Jewish resistance in German-occupied Europe *Auschwitz bombing debate *Western betrayal *Appeasement * Battle of Radzymin (1944)  References  External links * Britain and the Warsaw Rising - and article by N.

Ceramic was the largest ship serving the route until P&O; introduced in 1923. In 1934 Shaw, Savill & Albion Line took over White Star's Australia route and acquired Ceramic. The liner served as a troopship in both World Wars. She was sunk by a German submarine in 1942, leaving only one survivor from the 656 people aboard. Building Harland and Wolff built Ceramic in Belfast, launching her on 11 December 1912 and completing her in 1913. She was delivered on 5 July and her total cost was ¬£436,000. Ceramic had two triple expansion engines, each with one high pressure, one medium pressure and two low pressure cylinders. Exhaust steam from the two engines' low pressure cylinders drove a single low-pressure steam turbine. Ceramic was propelled by three screws: the middle one driven by the low-pressure turbine and the port and starboard ones each driven by one of the reciprocating engines. Ceramic had four decks and eight holds, and in her original configuration 38% of her cargo capacity was refrigerated. White Star service Ceramics maiden voyage began on 24 July 1913 when she left Liverpool for Australia. At the time she was the largest liner on the route between the two countries. In 1914 she was requisitioned for the First Australian Imperial Force as the troopship HMAT (His Majesty's Australian Transport) Ceramic, with the pennant number A40. She was armed with two stern-mounted QF 4.7 inch (120mm) naval guns. By 1933 she carried wireless direction finding and echo sounding equipment. In 1916 Ceramic took the Territorial Army 25th (County of London) Cyclist Battalion to India, leaving Devonport on 3 February and reaching Bombay on 25 February. Ceramic survived a number of attacks. In May 1916 she was in the Mediterranean carrying 2,500 troops when two torpedoes from an unidentified attacker missed her. On 9 June 1917 she was in the English Channel when again a torpedo from an unidentified attacker missed her. On 21 July in the North Atlantic off the Canary Islands a surfaced U-boat chased her for 40 minutes. Ceramic fired on the U-boat with her 4.7 inch stern guns and outran her attacker. In May 1917 Ceramic was transferred from Australian control to the UK Shipping Controller under the Liner Requisition Scheme. In 1919 she was returned to White Star Line and in 1920 Harland and Wolff refitted her as a civilian liner. She resumed civilian service on 18 November 1920 when she left Liverpool for Glasgow and Sydney. Ceramic ran aground on the River Clyde at Glasgow on 12 January 1925. She later was refloated and drydocked. On 18 December 1930, Ceramic collided with the Pacific Steam Navigation Company's cargo ship in the River Thames near Gravesend. Both ships were slightly damaged. Shaw, Savill and Albion peacetime service In 1934 White Star merged with Cunard. Ceramic was sold to Shaw, Savill and Albion but kept the same route and name. She started her first voyage for her new owner on 25 August, when she left Liverpool for Brisbane. In June 1936 Harland and Wolff's yard in Govan, Glasgow began a refit to modernise Ceramic. Her forward bridge deck was glassed in, a verandah caf√© was added aft. As refitted she had 36 corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of . The furnaces heated six double-ended boilers with a combined heating surface of . The boilers supplied steam at 215 lbf/in2 to Ceramics two triple-expansion engines. This gave her 1,692 NHP and increased her speed by . Ceramic resumed service on 15 August 1936. Second World War service When the Second World War broke out on 1 September 1939 Ceramic was at Tenerife on her regular route to South Africa and Australia. She continued as scheduled, unescorted, reaching Australia in October. She left Sydney on 1 November and returned unescorted until she reached Freetown, Sierra Leone, where she joined Convoy SL 13F, becoming the convoy vice-commodore's ship. SL 13F left port on 19 December and reached Liverpool on 3 January 1940. In February 1940 Ceramic was commissioned as a troopship. She kept her usual route, leaving Liverpool unescorted on 19 February and reaching Sydney on 14 April. She left Sydney for home on 20 April, and after her regular calls in Australia and South Africa she put into Freetown on 2 June. If she was seeking a home-bound convoy she found none, for she sailed the next day unescorted and reached Liverpool on 13 June. =Collision with Testbank= On 20 July 1940 Ceramic left Liverpool with Convoy OB 186. This dispersed at sea two days later as scheduled. In the South Atlantic in the small hours of 11 August 1940 Bank Line's cargo ship sighted Ceramic about a mile and a half ahead. Under wartime navigation regulations both ships were sailing without navigation lights. Ceramics lookout failed to see Testbank until the two ships were about from each other. Both ships took avoiding action but were too late to avoid a collision. About 0200 hrs Testbank rammed Ceramics starboard bow. The combined speed of the collision was about . It shortened the cargo ship's bow by about and opened a hole about wide in the liner's Number One Hold, but both ships stayed afloat. Testbanks cargo was 9,000 tons of iron ore, which would have sunk her very quickly if she had shipped enough water. In the event she was able to return to Cape Town under her own power. As a precaution, Ceramics 279 passengers were taken off and transferred by boats to the P&O; liner . Ceramic reached Walvis Bay in South West Africa with the aid of a tug and escorted by a Royal Navy warship. She arrived on 16 August and stayed for emergency repairs until 24 September. She reached Cape Town on 27 September and stayed there for almost ¬£50,000 worth of further repairs. On 10 December Ceramic resumed her passage to Australia, reaching Sydney on 18 January 1941. Apart from a visit to Newcastle, New South Wales Ceramic stayed in Sydney until 21 March, when she left for home. She made her usual calls in South Africa at the end of April and reached Liverpool on 28 May. =Further war service= On 28 or 29 June 1941 Ceramic left Liverpool with Convoy WS 9B, which reached Freetown on 13 July. She continued unescorted via South Africa as usual, reaching Sydney on 4 September, where she stayed until 1 October. She then visited Newcastle and Brisbane before leaving Sydney for home on 12 October. Instead of returning by her usual route Ceramic turned east across the Tasman Sea, called at Wellington, New Zealand 19‚Äì27 October and then crossed the Pacific. In November she passed through the Panama Canal and reached Halifax, Nova Scotia. There she joined Convoy HX 163, which left on 3 December and reached Liverpool on 19 December. In January 1942 Ceramic left Liverpool with Convoy ON 59 until it dispersed as scheduled in the North Atlantic. Because of the threat of enemy attack her Atlantic route from Liverpool to Cape Town was extended westwards. She steamed west unescorted across the North Atlantic to Halifax, arriving on 7 February. On 15 February she left Halifax and under naval escort to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, arriving on 5 March. She continued unescorted via South Africa to Australia, reaching Sydney on 29 April. Again she continued east to return home, this time calling at Lyttelton, New Zealand on 2 June before crossing the Pacific and the passing through Panama Canal. In Crist√≥bal, Col√≥n she joined Convoy Convoy CW 2/1, which left on 3 July and reached Key West on 12 July, where most of its ships including Ceramic joined Convoy KN 119. This left Key West the same day and reached Hampton Roads, Virginia on 17 July. Ceramic continued unescorted, calling at New York 24‚Äì27 July and continuing to Halifax where she joined Convoy HX 201. This left on 2 August and reached Liverpool on 14 August. On this voyage Ceramic carried 372 passengers to Liverpool. =Loss= On 3 November 1942 Ceramic left Liverpool for Australia via Saint Helena and South Africa. She was carrying 377 passengers, 264 crew, 14 DEMS gunners and 12,362 tons of cargo. 244 of the passengers were military or naval, including at least 145 British Army, 30 Royal Navy, 14 Royal Australian Navy and 12 Royal Marines. 30 of her British Army passengers were QAIMNS nursing sisters. The other 133 passengers were fare-paying civilians. 12 were children, the youngest being a one-year-old baby girl. Six were doctors, five of whom were South African. One passenger was Rudolph Dolmetsch (190642), classical musician and composer, then serving as Regimental Bandmaster with the Royal Artillery. Ceramic sailed with Convoy ON 149 until it dispersed as scheduled in the North Atlantic. She then continued unescorted as planned. As on her previous departure in January, she first headed west because of the threat of enemy attack. At midnight on 6‚Äì7 December, in cold weather and rough seas in mid-Atlantic, hit Ceramic with a single torpedo. These were followed two or three minutes later by two more that hit Ceramics engine room, stopping her engines and her electric lighting. The liner radioed a distress signal, which was received by the . The crippled liner stayed afloat and her complement abandoned ship in good order, launching about eight lifeboats all full of survivors. The light cruiser received Ceramics distress signal About three hours later U-515 fired two more torpedoes, which broke the ship's back and sank her immediately. By now it was very stormy and raining. The heavy sea capsized some of the lifeboats and left many people struggling in the water. Those boats that were not capsized stayed afloat only by constant baling. Next morning the BdU ordered U-515 to return to the position of the sinking to find out the ship's destination. About noon the U-boat commander, Kapit√§nleutnant Werner Henke, decided to rescue the Ceramics skipper. In heavy seas, he sighted one of the lifeboats and its occupants waved to him. The storm was now almost Force 10 and almost swamping U-515s conning tower, so Henke ordered his crew to make do with the first survivor they could find. This turned out to be Sapper Eric Munday of the Royal Engineers, whom they rescued from the water and took prisoner aboard the submarine. No other occupants of the lifeboats survived. The storm was too severe for neutral rescue ships from S√£o Miguel Island in the Azores to put to sea. On 9 December the Portuguese was sent to search for survivors, but found none. Munday was kept prisoner aboard U-515 for a month, including Christmas and New Year, until she completed her patrol.

Eerdmans dictionary of the Bible , 2000, p.551 is a man in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible. He died in Ur of Chaldees (Ur Ka≈õdim), was a son of Terah, and brother of Abraham. Through his son Lot, Haran was the ancestor of the Moabites and Ammonites, and through his daughter Milcah he was ancestral to the Aramaeans. Haran and his family Terah, a descendant of Shem son of Noah, was the father of Abram/Abraham, Nahor, and Haran. Their home's location is not certain, but it is usually supposed to have been in Mesopotamia. Besides Lot and Milcah, Haran fathered a daughter Iscah. After Haran died in Ur of the Chaldees 'before his father Terah', his family travelled towards Canaan, the promised land. However, Terah stopped at Charan (or Haran) and settled there, as did Nahor and Milcah, whereas Lot accompanied Abraham and others onwards to Canaan.Eerdmans dictionary, p. 997 Etymology The name Haran possibly comes from the Hebrew word har, = \\"mountain\\", with a West Semitic suffix appearing with proper names, anu/i/a.D.

The mountain and the rotunda are among the Czech national cultural monuments. Geologically, ≈ò√≠p is the erosional remnant of a Late Oligocene volcano and is composed of basalt nephelites containing olivine granules, amphibole, leucite and -- among others -- magnetite, so a local magnetic anomaly can even be observed there by the compass. The hill was bare until 1879 when Mo≈ôic Lobkowitz had it planted with trees. Today, almost all of the mountain is covered by an oak-and-hornbeam forest with some maple, pine ash, and linden trees. Some rare thermophile plants can be found at the few tree-less places on the top of the hill, such as Gagea bohemica and Iris pumila. ≈ò√≠p, being visible from great distance, has always been an important orientation point in the Bohemian scenery and has attracted attention since the oldest times. Name The name of the mountain is of pre-Slavic origin and probably comes from the Old-Germanic stem r√≠p- (elevation, hill), which has the Latin parallel in the word r√≠pa (shore, slope, hillside). Some linguists also derive the origin of the name from the Illyrian-Thracian base. The rotunda of Saint George on top of the hill View from ≈ò√≠p hill Legend According to a traditional legend, first recorded by the ancient Czech chronicler Cosmas of Prague in the early 12th century, ≈ò√≠p was the place where the first Slavs, led by Forefather ƒåech, settled. According to the Chronicle of Dalimil from 1310, when ƒåech and his people climbed ≈ò√≠p Mountain, he looked upon the landscape and told his brothers that they have reached the promised land: \\"We have a country at our will, here will be our tables always full, enough of wild animals, birds, fishes, bees and hardness against enemies.\\" The land was named after the leader. In the 16th century, the legend was revived by V√°clav H√°jek of Liboƒçany who claimed that ƒåech was buried in the nearby village of Ctinƒõves and, later on, by Alois Jir√°sek in his Old Bohemian Legends from 1894. Buildings On top of the hill there is a romanesque rotunda of Saint George, which is one of the oldest buildings in the Czech Republic. This is mentioned for the first time in 1126, when Sobƒõslav I, Duke of Bohemia, commemorating his victory at the Battle of Chlumec, where he defeated Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III, had the rotunda repaired and extended by the western circular tower. The rotunda's current appearance is the result of a purist reconstruction during the 1870s. Inside the rotunda is a stone sculpture by contemporary Czech artist Stanislav Hanzik‚Äî\\"The Good Shepherd\\", 1979‚Äîsymbolising the arrival of Czech ancestors to the country and the beginning of Czech history there. Near the rotunda is a tourist hut that was built in 1907 and still serves travellers today. In accordance with the patriotic spirit of that era, a wooden plate is mounted on the hut wall that says, \\"What Mecca is to a Muslim, ≈ò√≠p is to a Czech\\" (Czech: \\"Co Mohamedu Mekka, to ƒåechu ≈ò√≠p\\"). Points of interest The top of ≈ò√≠p became a popular pilgrimage place and a frequent site of national manifestations and mass meetings. A famous manifestation was held there on 10 May 1868 when the foundation stone was taken from the hill for the newly built National Theatre in Prague. Tradition has, that each Czech should climb this mountain at least once in his life.hora-rip.eu References External links * Microregion Pod≈ôipsko (cz) * virtual show Category:Mountains and hills of the Czech Republic Category:Litomƒõ≈ôice District Category:Magnetic anomalies Category:Geography of the √öst√≠ nad Labem Region Category:Tourist attractions in the √öst√≠ nad Labem Region Category:National Cultural Monuments of the Czech Republic ","title":"≈ò√≠p Mountain"},{"id":"892134","text":"Cambridge is a suburb in the greater area of Hobart, capital of Tasmania, Australia.

It was initially released as Jungle King, but changed as a result of copyright dispute. Published the same year as Moon Patrol, Jungle Hunt is one of the first video games to use parallax scrolling. The player controls an unnamed explorer, sporting a pith helmet and safari suit, attempting to rescue his girl from a tribe of cannibals by swinging from vine to vine, swimming a crocodile-infested river, and avoiding rolling rocks. A variant starring a pirate instead of an explorer was released in arcades as Pirate Pete. Gameplay The gameplay is split into four scenes, which have different objectives. In Scene 1, the explorer is required to swing from vine to vine. This is accomplished by pressing the action key when two vines swing closely enough together. Timing is critical, and missing the vine causes the explorer to fall to the jungle floor, losing a life. Scene 2 has the explorer navigating a crocodile-infested river. The explorer can attack the crocodiles from below with his knife, unless their mouths are open. The explorer must return to the surface periodically to breathe, where he cannot attack the crocodiles. Bubbles periodically rise from the bottom of the river, which can trap the explorer and carry him to the surface, potentially hitting crocodiles on the way. Scene 3 involves the explorer dodging various-sized boulders rolling and bouncing towards him as he runs up the side of a volcano. Timing is critical as the differently sized boulders bounce at different speeds and heights, and the explorer can be trapped between them. In the final scene, the explorer must evade cannibals while attempting to get to a woman being lowered into a flaming cauldron. After the player rescues the woman, the word \\"Congratulations!\\" appears, which is then followed by a message saying \\"I Love You!!!\\" followed by the woman kissing the explorer. Further gameplay repeats the scenes with increased difficulty. On rounds other than the first, a cannibal appears in the tree of the cauldron scene and throws spears at the player. Name change The release of Jungle King with its Tarzan-like hero prompted legal action from the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs. This resulted in the name being changed to Jungle Hunt with several cosmetic modifications: #The main character is an explorer wearing a pith helmet and safari outfit. #The swinging vines have slightly different visuals to pass them off as ropes. #The Tarzan yell is replaced by the music from the end of the second scene. Ports Scene 1 on the Atari 2600 Atari published home ports in 1983 under their own brand for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari 8-bit family. The rest were released under the Atarisoft label: Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, VIC-20, IBM PC, and TI-99/4A. In the Atari-ported versions the hero is named Sir Dudley, and the girl, married to Sir Dudley, is Lady Penelope. The Apple II and IBM PC versions were developed by Sierra On-Line. Reception In a 1983 Electronic Games review prior to the game being renamed, Bill Kunkel wrote, \\"Jungle King is an undeniable kick the first few plays, but doesn't seem to hold up for extended periods of time.\\" He called the graphics of the vine-swinging segment \\"downright hideous,\\" but also said the game might be Taito's \\"biggest hit since Space Invaders.\\" Jungle Hunt gained a Certificate of Merit in the category of \\"1984 Best Adventure Videogame\\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. Legacy In 1982, Taito released a version of Jungle Hunt in arcades as Pirate Pete with the same gameplay. The jungle explorer is now a pirate; the vines are replaced by ropes swinging from the masts of a very long ship; sharks swim the water intead of crocodiles; and sword-wielding pirates take the place of cannibals. In 1983, Milton Bradley published a board game version of Jungle Hunt where ropes are a key element. Jungle Hunt is included in the Taito Legends collection for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.

He rose in the ranks to become the leader of the party's terrorist branch, the SR Combat Organization, from 1904 to 1908. After having been found out by the revolutionary Vladimir Burtsev in 1909, he fled to Germany where he died in 1918.  Early life  Yevno Fishelevich Azef was born in Lyskava (now Brest Region, Belarus) in 1869, the second of seven children of a poor Jewish tailor. His father moved to Rostov with the family when Yevno was aged five, opened a drapery, but barely made enough money to get his children through school. After leaving school, around 1890, Azef worked as a journalist and a traveling salesman. In 1892, the police suspected him of distributing revolutionary literature. To avoid arrest, he embezzled 800 rubles and fled to Germany, first to Karlsruhe and then Darmstadt. There he studied to become an electrical engineer, and joined a group of Russian social democrats.  Career as a double agent  In April 1893, Azef wrote to the Okhrana - the Russian police - offering to inform on his fellow students, for money. Later in the year, he moved to Switzerland, and in Berne, in 1894, joined the Union of Socialist Revolutionaries Abroad, organised by the respected narodnik couple, Chaim Zhitlovsky and Vera Lokhova. When he graduated, in 1899, the Okhrana ordered him to return to Russia, where he joined the Northern Union of Socialist Revolutionaries, led by A.A. Argunov, and became, in effect, his right hand man, even though Azef wanted the revolutionaries to resume the use of terrorist tactics, and Argunov did not believe in violence. He valued Azef's ability to resolve practical problems, such as setting up an underground printing operation - unaware that he was being assisted by the Okhrana. In November 1901, Argunov sent him to Europe to help unify the Northern, Southern and foreign Socialist Revolutionary unions into a single organisation. Argunov was arrested as soon as Azef had left Russia. In Switzerland, in 1902, Azef was a founding member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and became deputy head of its combat organisation (terrorist branch), headed by Grigori Gershuni. Gershuni thought so highly of Azef that he nominated him as his successor, so when Gershuni was arrested in spring 1903 after being betrayed by another double agent, Azef became head of the combat organisation (with Boris Savinkov as his deputy), and thus, simultaneously, Russia's leading terrorist and highest paid police informant. In that position he organized assassinations of Vyacheslav Plehve (1904) - who, as minister of interior, was Azef's nominal employer and the person who had ultimately authorised him to infiltrate the combat organisation, and who had made Gershuni's arrest the police's main priority, thus facilitating Azef's rise - and of the Governor of Moscow, the Tsar's uncle Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia (1905). The success of these two assassinations gave Azef immense prestige within the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Because he was so trusted, he was able to deliver up a long list of party members over to the Okhrana, to be arrested, including Anna Yakimova, a veteran of the plot to kill the Tsar Alexander II, who had served 24 years in prison, and Zinaida Kopolyannikova, who was hanged in August 1906 for assassinating the head of the Tsar's lifeguards. In 1905 alone, according to researchers who accessed police records after the 1917 revolution, he betrayed 17 members of the combat organisation. The assassinations also set off a crisis within the Okhrana. The Director of Police, Alexei Lopukhin, resigned, and was replaced by his rival Pyotr Rachkovsky, whom he despised. One of Rachkovsky's first actions was to sack Leonid Ratayev, who had been acting as Azef's controller, and take over supervision of him personally. His actions were resented by some of the Okhrana's long serving officers, one of whom anonymously tipped off the Socialist Revolutionaries that there were two spies in their ranks - Azef, and a man named Tatarov. Boris Savinkov ordered that Tatarov should be killed: he was stabbed to death on 4 April 1906 - but none of the revolutionaries could believe that Azef was also a spy. Nonetheless, fearing more leaks from within the Okhrana, Azef emigrated to Geneva. He was in Helsingfors in February 1906, when he learnt from a go-between named Pinchas Rutenberg that Father Gapon, the popular hero of the 1905 revolution, had become a police informant. Azef ordered that Gapon should be killed \\"like a snake.\\"Notes on Georgii Appolonovich Gapon (1870-1906), Northern Virginia Community College \\\\- though he took care to ensure that his paymaster, Rachkovsky, was not killed at the same time.  Exposure  Late in 1906, Vladimir Burtsev, a left wing magazine editor, was approached by an Okhrana officer who had turned against the government, who provided him with a wealth of accurate information, including the presence of a spy in the leadership of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, whose identity he did not know. Later, Burtsev spotted Azef riding through St Petersburg in an open cab when most revolutionaries were in hiding, and suspected that he was the unidentified spy. Unable to prove his suspicions, or persuade any significant figures within the party to share them, Burtsev contrived to meet Alexei Lopukhin in the carriage of a train leaving Cologne, and put it to him that Azef was a spy, which Lopukhin confirmed. Burtsev then wrote up the case against Azef, had it printed and dispatched to the Central Committee of the SR party, who appointed three veteran revolutionaries - Vera Figner, German Lopatin and Prince Kropotkin - as a Court of Honour, which held a month-long hearing in Paris, and concluded that Burtsev's claims should be taken seriously. Learning where Burtsev had gained his information, Azef secretly visited Petersburg to put pressure on Lopukhin to repudiate his story. Instead, Lopukhin approached Azev's former mentor, Andrei Argunov, in Petersburg to verify Burtsev's testimony, then travelled to London to give the same information to three of the party's representatives. In January 1909, the Central Committee resolved to have Azef killed, and tried to lure him to an isolated villa in France, but he fled to Germany. His wife, Ljuba Mankin, who had been unaware of his double-dealing, divorced him and moved to the United States. One of his last acts as a spy was to denounce Lopukhin, who was exiled to Siberia. In Germany, Azef lived with a singer and worked as a corset salesman and stock speculator, investing the money he had amassed during his career as a double spy, constantly in fear of being recognised and killed. From 1915 to 1917, during the First World War, he was interned by Germany as an enemy alien. In prison he suffered from kidney disease.  Death  Yevno Azef died of renal failure in Berlin on April 24, 1918. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Wilmersdorf cemetery.  Books  * Nikolajewsky, B.

In Australia, it operated asbestos plants in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Working with the products containing asbestos - including asbestos cement - caused people to develop various pleural abnormalities such as asbestosis and malignant mesothelioma.Handen Zeren, E., Gurmurdulu, D, Roggli, V. et al.

Asbestos =History= In 1978 the effects of pleural abnormalities and other asbestos- related diseases were beginning to show up in the former mine workers. While other companies were involved in similar asbestos-related activities, most notably CSR, more than 50% of claims made to the Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales in 2002 were brought against companies in the James Hardie group.In the Shadow of the Corporate Veil: James Hardie and Asbestos Compensation Parliament of Australia 10 August 2004 James Hardie and its subsidiaries had been providing compensation for victims of its operations since the 1980s. Though some earlier claims had arisen, the proliferation of cases from the 1980s onwards forced James Hardie to acknowledge that it had known asbestos to be dangerous. James Hardie nonetheless maintained that it had done everything possible to protect workers. In 1978 the company began putting warning labels on its products explaining that inhalation of the dust could result in cancer.Lives in the Dust Sydney Morning Herald 25 September 2004 page 27 In March 1987 James Hardie ceased all asbestos manufacturing activities. As concern grew about the serious adverse health effects of asbestos, in the mid-1980s James Hardie developed an asbestos-free fibre cement technology, without the dangers associated with asbestos. =The MRCF and move to the Netherlands= James Hardie had been structured as a parent company operating through subsidiaries since the 1930s. All asbestos operations, including the provision of compensation, were undertaken by James Hardie's subsidiaries, principally James Hardie and Coy and Hardie-Ferodo (later known as Jsekarb).Australian Council of Trade Unions (2007) James Hardie Asbestos Victims Compensation Background Facts Between 1995 and 2000, James Hardie (the parent company) began to remove the assets of these subsidiaries (since renamed Amaca and Amaba respectively), whilst leaving them with most of the asbestos liabilities of the James Hardie group. In 2001 these two companies were separated from James Hardie and acquired by the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation (MRCF) which was essentially created in order to act as an administrator for Hardie's asbestos liabilities. Then CEO of James Hardie, Peter McDonald, made public announcements emphasising that the MRCF had sufficient funds to meet all future claims and that James Hardie would not give it any further substantial funds. Indeed, the net assets of the MRCF were $293 million, mostly in real estate and loans, and exceeded the 'best estimate' of $286 million in liabilities which had been estimated in an actuarial report commissioned by James Hardie. The Jackson Report found that this 'best estimate' was 'wildly optimistic' and the estimates of future liabilities was 'far too low'. After this separation, James Hardie moved offshore to the Netherlands for what it claimed were significant tax advantages for the company and its shareholders. To make this move, the company had to assure Australian courts (as it was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange) that the MRCF would be able to meet future liabilities. The courts were assured of this and that more money would be made available to its Australian asbestos victims through the issue of partly paid shares to MRCF obliging the new Dutch parent company to meet a call for funds if it were needed. The value of the call at the time was $1.9 billion. The move to the Netherlands therefore proceeded. However, the tax benefits which James Hardie expected to receive as a result from its move did not eventuate following the revision of tax laws in the United States in 2001 and later with the United States signing a new trade agreement with the Netherlands in 2006. Shortly after the move, an actuarial report found that James Hardie asbestos liabilities were likely to reach $574 million. The MRCF sought extra funding from James Hardie and was offered $18 million in assets, an offer the MRCF rejected. The estimate of asbestos liabilities was promptly revised to $752 million in 2002 and then $1.58 billion in 2003. The funding shortfall became of increasing concern in 2004 as it became clear that eligible victims would miss out on receiving compensation after it was revealed that in March 2003 James Hardie had cancelled the partly paid shares that were intended to be a safety net for the fund. In discussing the shortfall with the MRCF, James Hardie refused to accept further responsibility for the liabilities on the basis that the MRCF and James Hardie were separate legal entities. =Inquiry= On 12 February 2004, a judicial inquiry into the matter was commissioned by the Government of New South Wales. The findings were very critical of James Hardie and its management. Amongst other findings, it found that the actuarial reports commissioned by James Hardie which estimated liabilities at $286 million were inadequate because they used a financial model which made unfounded predictions on the value of investments held by Amaca and Amaba, the figures were subject to numerous unspecified conditions and they did not account for the effect of separating Amaca and Amaba from James Hardie. However, the inquiry found that James Hardie was under no legal obligation to provide compensation. Despite this finding, there was immense political and social pressure on James Hardie to negotiate a compensation deal; governments were boycotting James Hardie productsHardie Promises to Support Victims Sydney Morning Herald 26 October 2004 page 2 and unions were threatening to instigate a global union movement against the company based on refusing to handle James Hardie products.Building Unions Black-Ban Products Australian Financial Review 30 July 2004 page 8 Following the results of the inquiry, James Hardie entered into negotiations with governments and trade unions in an effort to establish some sort of compensation system for eligible victims of James Hardie's products. In December 2004, James Hardie agreed to pay compensation to the victims of its products through a voluntary compensation fund. The details of the fund were to be legally determined by June 2005 but progress was stalled and the company refused to disclose the date the deal would be finalised.Hardie Report Not End of Fight The Australian 21 September 2004 page 3 Further conflicts between the company and the Federal Government over tax deductibility of donations to the voluntary fund saw finalisation of the deal further delayed. It was not until November 2006, after the federal government had created 'black hole' tax legislation,Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 1) Act 2006 Cth. which made the contributions of James Hardie into the voluntary fund tax deductible, and had granted the voluntary fund tax-exempt status, that James Hardie finalised the compensation deal. There was immense pressure on the Federal Government from state governments, union leaders and victims to remove the tax problem.James Hardie Compo Deal in Doubt After Tax Ruling Sydney Morning Herald 24 June 2006 page 5 The final step in giving the voluntary fund a legal structure was approval of the scheme by James Hardie shareholders. In February 2007, 99.6% of shareholders voted in favour of the scheme and it began operating days later.James Hardie compensation deal approved Sydney Morning Herald 7 February 2007 =Legal actions against management= After the inquiry in 2004, prosecutors were considering bringing civil and criminal charges against the CEO and other senior executives for making fraudulent statements as to the liquidity of the MRCF.Fresh go at Hardie Granted Sydney Morning Herald 21 November 2007 page 2 In February 2007 every member of the 2001 board and some members of senior management were charged by the Australian Securities & Investment Commission (ASIC) with a range of breaches of the Corporations Act 2001 including breach of director's duties by failing to act with care and diligence.ASIC takes action against James Hardie 7:30 Report 15 February 2007 ASIC also undertook investigations into possible criminal charges against the company's executives but in September 2008 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions decided there was insufficient evidence and charges were not pursued.ASIC Drops Criminal Pursuit of James Hardie The World Today 5 September 2008 In 2009, the Supreme Court of New South Wales found that directors had misled the stock exchange in relation to James Hardie's ability to fund claims. They were also banned from serving as board members for five years. Former chief executive Peter Macdonald was banned for 15 years and fined $350,000 for his role in forming the MRCF and publicising it.James Hardie appeals court rulings ABC News 23 September 2009 The former directors, excepting Macdonald, appealed and the New South Wales Court of Appeal subsequently overturned the ruling against these directors in 2010. ASIC appealed against the ruling in the High Court of Australia in October 2011. In May 2012 the High Court upheld the 2009 New South Wales court decision and found that seven former James Hardie non-executive directors did mislead the stock exchange over the asbestos victims compensation fund. In August 2019 Mathew Werfel, a DIY handyman from Adelaide, won $3 million in a compensation case against James Hardie. Werfel was exposed to asbestos while pulling down fences and renovating two homes between 1990-2000 and was diagnosed with testicle cancer in 2017. James Hardie's new products no longer contain asbestos, but Werfel's lawyer claimed the company should have done more to alert the public to the existence of asbestos in its old products which were used in old homes.

It was originally located by its unfamiliar poo-ooo call in the Kitulgala rainforest by prominent Sri Lankan ornithologist Deepal Warakagoda. Six years later, it was finally seen by him on 23 January 2001 in Sinharaja, and formally described as a species new to science in 2004.Warakagoda, Deepal H. & Rasmussen, Pamela C. (2004): A new species of scops owl from Sri Lanka. Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club 124(2): 85-105\\\\. PDF fulltext Apart from Sinharaja and Kitulgala, it has also been found at Runakanda Reserve in Morapitiya and Eratna Gilimale. Known as ‡∂¥‡∂©‡∑î‡∑Ä‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂∂‡∑É‡∑ä‡∑É‡∑è in Sinhala. It is the first new bird to be discovered in Sri Lanka since 1868, when the Sri Lanka whistling thrush--then Ceylon whistling thrush--(Myophonus blighi) was discovered. It is also the 24th (according to some authorities the 27th) endemic bird species for Sri Lanka. The habitat of the Serendib scops owl is in the southern rain forests of Sri Lanka. There is an altitudinal range from 30 to 50 metres. This owl has no competition from other nocturnal birds, the territories are completely different. This species has a very small population, at the end of January 2006 only 80 of them were known to exist. The places that it is expected to be found are in five protected areas, like the Forest Reserve or the Proposed Reserve by Sri Lanka. They seem to be declining because of the loss of habitat and the degradation. The first two hours of darkness is when the owl hunts for its food. This rare species inhabits the rainforests in the southwestern part of Sri Lanka. Like most owls, it is strictly nocturnal and hunts insects (e.g. beetles and moths) close to the ground. It begins calling at dusk, its frequency rising again some two hours before dawn. Unlike the other two species of scops owl in Sri Lanka, Indian scops owl (Otus bakkamoena) and oriental scops owl (Otus sunia), it does not have ear tufts and its facial disc is only weakly defined. The general colour of this 16.5 cm long, short-tailed owl is reddish brown with paler underparts, spotted all over with fine black markings. The irides are tawny yellow (more orangish in male) and the feet are a pale fleshy colour. Tarsi are feathered for less than half their length. The claws and bill are a pale ivory colour. Taxonomic status In 2006 and 2007, two papers were published by Sri Lankan ornithologists in the publication Loris questioning whether the Serendib scops owl was a distinct species from other scops owl species found in India, and if so, whether it was actually a new discovery or a rediscovery.Kotagama, S.W., De Silva, R.I. and Kaluthota, CD. 2006. \\"Taxonomic uncertainty of the new species of Scops-owl from Sri Lanka (Part 1)\\".

He became famous by exposing a great number of agents provocateurs, notably Yevno Azef in 1908. Because of his own revolutionary activities and his harsh criticism of the imperial regime, including personal criticism of emperor Nicholas II, he was imprisoned several times in various European countries. In the course of his life, Burtsev fought oppressive policies from Tsarism in Imperial Russia, followed by the Bolsheviks and later Adolf Hitler's National Socialism.  Early life (1862 - 1886) Burtsev was born in Fort- Aleksandrovsky, in the Transcaspian Oblast of the Russian Empire (present-day Kazakhstan) to a military family. In 1882, he was expelled from Saint Petersburg State University and in 1885 from Kazan State University for taking part in student disturbances. As a member of Narodnaya Volya, he was imprisoned for two years (for about a year in the Peter and Paul Fortress) and in 1886 exiled to the Irkutsk region of Eastern Siberia.  Exile and publications (1888 - 1914)  In 1888 Burtsev managed to escape from exile and emigrate to Switzerland. In 1889 he co-founded magazine Svobodnaya Rossiya (–°–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è, Free Russia) but it survived only three issues. \\"In 1890 . . . Burtsev, wanted by the czarist police, boarded a British boat bound from Constantinople to London. When the ship found itself surrounded by Turkish police vessels with Russians on board, the captain refused their demand to hand over the fugitive, announcing: ‚ÄúThis is English territory. And I am a gentleman!‚ÄùDoherty, Brian (2010-12-17) The First War on Terror, Reason In 1898, Burtsev was arrested by British police for advocating, in his magazine Narodovolets (–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤–æ–ª–µ—Ü, Narodnaya Volya Comrade), the assassination of Nicholas II. Burtsev was found guilty and sentenced to 18 months at hard labour. On his release he went on to publish it in Switzerland, resulting in his permanent ban from that country. In London, he published the two-volume book Za Sto Let (1800‚Äì1896) (–ó–∞ —Å—Ç–æ –ª–µ—Ç (1800‚Äì1896), For Hundred Years (1800‚Äì1896)). He founded and published six issues of Byloye (–ë—ã–ª–æ–µ, The Past), a historical magazine. After the Russian Revolution of 1905 Burtsev briefly returned illegally to Russia and founded the Russian version of the Byloye magazine. Upon his return to the West in 1907, Burtsev began publishing the magazine Obshcheye Delo (–û–±—â–µ–µ –¥–µ–ª–æ, Common Cause) which was a continuation of the foreign edition of Byloye beginning with the 7th issue. By exposing numerous Tsarist agent provocateurs such as Yevno Azef, Burtsev gained fame as a counterintelligence expert and became known as \\"the Sherlock Holmes of the Revolution\\".  World War I and the Bolsheviks (1914 - 1921)  At the outset of World War I in 1914 he repatriated, was arrested at the border and again exiled to Siberia. Amnestied in 1915, he returned to Petrograd. Burtsev strenuously opposed the Bolsheviks. In 1917 he accused Lenin and his comrades of being agents of Germany. In his article Either Us or the Germans and Those with Them (Russian Freedom, July 7, 1917), he listed the major enemies of Russia: # Bolsheviks, whose demagoguery puts their own goals above the interests of Russia # Reactionary forces # German agents and spies. The Bolsheviks are, and always have been, the agents of Wilhelm II. On the day of the October revolution, he was arrested on orders of Leon Trotsky, which led some historians to count him as the first political prisoner in the USSR. Despite their political differences and public disputes in the press, Maxim Gorky pleaded for Burtsev's release and in February 1918 he was indeed freed and left Soviet Russia. Burtsev spent the rest of his life as an emigre, first in Finland, then Sweden and later in France. During the Russian Civil War, he supported the White Movement of Admiral Kolchak and General Anton Denikin. His numerous attempts to bring all anti-Bolshevik forces together under one ideological umbrella did not succeed.  Later life and death (1921 - 1942)  In 1921 Burtsev co-founded and became chairman of the Russian National Committee. Bookcover of Burtsev's The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proven Forgery In 1930s, Burtsev fought against fascism and antisemitism. In 1934‚Äì1935 he was a witness in the Berne Trial, exposing the Okhrana's role in creating the infamous fraud The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. In 1938 in Paris he published a book The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proven Forgery. Burtsev died in poverty in Paris in 1942 from a blood infection.

The magazine originated in 1989 as a newsletter sent to friends by Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman, but as it grew in popularity, it became a public magazine published twice a year. It spawned a series of books called Weird US, which chronicle oddities from individual states in the United States aside from New Jersey, which in turn led to a television series that aired on the History Channel. History Weird NJ began in 1989 as a personal newsletter sent to friends by Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman. Gradually it evolved from a fanzine into a public magazine published twice a year in May and October. Abandoned places, eerie experiences, unique people, and strange landmarks were and still are common subjects for the magazine. Past issues have covered everything from the Jersey Devil and UFO sightings to abandoned Nike missile silos, the legend of the \\"Hookerman\\" Lights and the life of Zippy the Pinhead. Subjects covered include the Evil Clown of Middletown, Midgetville, \\"Gates of Hell,\\" Shades of Death Road, Clinton Road, Demon Alley, and the Devil's Tower. The painting of a grinning face named Tillie from the Palace Amusements building in Asbury Park has appeared in several Weird NJ publications and on the magazine covers. In 2003 a Weird NJ book, made up of content from earlier issues, was published. The next year saw the follow-up Weird US, covering sites and stories across the country. That led to a series of Weird US books for other states and areas, including Florida, Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Texas, California and New England, and a TV series, Weird U.S., on the History Channel.

AOL Music. Retrieved on 2008-03-04. is an American radio personality, comedian, actor, television writer, announcer, and podcast host. He is best known for being on The Howard Stern Show from 1988 to 2004. Initially working as an intern, Melendez became known for asking impertinent questions to celebrities at events and press conferences with his stuttering. He left the show to become the announcer on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and also worked on Leno's later shows. In April 2018, he launched The Stuttering John Podcast. Early life Melendez grew up in the hamlet of Massapequa, New York, on Long Island and attended Plainedge High School.Controversial personalities who stutter. Minnesota State University, 1998-10-12. Retrieved on 2008-03-02.John Melendez. National Stuttering Association. Retrieved on 2008-03-02. Melendez was born to a Puerto Rican father and a Danish mother. According to Melendez, he began to stutter when he was in the second grade as a result of psychological mistreatment from his father after he witnessed an argument between his parents. He attended Plainedge High School, where he was picked on by the neighborhood bullies because of his stuttering. In 1988, Melendez attended New York University's film school and belonged to a band called \\"Rock Slide.\\" His college roommate, comedian Mitch Fatel, was on the verge of quitting his internship with The Howard Stern Show, when Melendez asked him for a recommendation for an internship there. The show's producer, Gary Dell'Abate, mentioned Melendez's stuttering to Howard Stern who, without seeing him and even before he was interviewed, told the producer to hire him. Career =1988‚Äì2004: The Howard Stern Show= On Stern's show, Melendez's primary role was answering phones and screening listener calls before they were allowed on the air. At the time of his joining, the show had just added Washington, D.C., as its third market in addition to New York City and Philadelphia. Over time, Melendez became known for segments in which he asked celebrities confrontational questions at red carpet events, functions, promotional appearances, and press conferences. The puerile questions‚Äîwritten by Howard Stern, Fred Norris, and Jackie Martling‚Äîcentered around a given celebrity's private life and were premised on the idea that they would not want to look bad by refusing an interview from someone who stuttered. Melendez sported long hair and metal T-shirts, asking questions by reading them from a sheet of paper. As he became better known, he occasionally wore a disguise consisting of an overcoat, fedora, and fake mustache. His interviews were characterized by punchline-free \\"joke\\" questions, such as asking actress Melanie Griffith how her father, Andy, was. The absurdity of the questions Melendez asked was often amplified by the fact that he himself appeared to lack common pop culture knowledge and often did not even seem to know who the subjects of his interview were or why they were famous. Melendez would thus frequently be unaware of why his questions would provoke such angry reactions, such as when he asked Ally Sheedy if she had vomited lately, unaware that the actress suffered from bulimia. Some celebrities were a personal target of Stern's, such as Ted Williams, who was interviewed by Melendez because Stern disapproved of athletes charging money for autographs. Celebrities would often react angrily, but other times, they would take the questions in good humor. Melendez notably interviewed Gennifer Flowers, Ringo Starr, and the Dalai Lama.Richard Lei, Nothing's Out of the Question, Washington Post, April 28, 1994 At Gennifer Flowers' news conference playing the 'Clinton Tapes', he asked her if she planned to sleep with any other candidates before the election, to which she reacted by laughing. He asked the Dalai Lama if anyone ever greeted him with \\"Hello Dalai!\\", in a joking reference to the play and movie; the Dalai Lama's translator whispered the translation to the Dalai Lama, who chuckled. Another time Melendez interviewed Debbie Gibson about losing an award to Wilson Phillips, to which she jokingly agreed with his idea that \\"the fat one would eat the statue.\\" Melendez also provided comic interest with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation. National exposure Melendez started receiving national exposure in the early 1990s as Stern's syndicated morning radio show acquired more markets (including Los Angeles and Cleveland) and particularly from June 1994 when its condensed version began airing nightly on E!: Entertainment Television, a basic cable network with national coverage in the United States. In 1994, Melendez signed a record contract with Atlantic Records and released his self-titled album with a music video broadcast on MTV's Headbangers Ball. That year, he was being paid $20,000 annually by the Stern show, which had 15 million listeners. During his 15-year run as Stern's employee, Melendez also starred in the Off- Broadway show Tony n' Tina's Wedding where he met his future wife, Suzanna. He appeared in such films as Airheads, Meet Wally Sparks, Dude, Where's My Car?, and Osmosis Jones, as well as Howard Stern's film Private Parts. He has also appeared on television in episodes of Wings, Baywatch Nights, and the 2003 United States version of the reality series I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!. Melendez was also the protagonist of some of the show's more outrageous moments. In 2001, during A.J. Benza's appearance, Melendez got slapped in the face by Benza who did not appreciate the incessant lampooning of his failed late-night show, seeing Melendez as the main culprit. The on-air slap prompted extended fracas and resulted in Benza being permanently banned from Stern's show. Throughout the early part of 2002, Melendez and WXRK afternoon deejay Lee Mroszak (aka \\"Crazy Cabbie\\") had numerous on-air spats, which were used by Stern as fodder for multiple segments on the show. Their feud eventually culminated in a boxing match scheduled for Friday morning May 31, 2002, at Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and was promoted on the show as \\"The Flunky versus the Junkie\\" with 2,500 tickets going on sale for $100 each. The 7 a.m. fight, essentially an extended segment on the show which itself was broadcast from around the ring that morning, was set for five two-minute rounds with a two-minute break in between each round. It went the distance, with the 175 lb Melendez winning over the 262 lb Cabbie by unanimous decision. Following a guest appearance on The Tonight Show to promote I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2003, Melendez received an offer from Jay Leno to become the late- night show's New York 'correspondent' who would ask celebrities questions on the red carpet, similar to one of his roles on the Stern show. Melendez claimed that he turned down the offer because he could not get a private conversation with Stern to ask him about it. Stern later claimed how \\"lame\\" an idea it was for Leno to reuse Melendez the way he did (in a less edgy way). In parallel with his duties on the Stern show in the morning, Melendez got a daily afternoon show on New York City's WXRK (The Howard Stern Show flagship station) from noon to 1 pm called Out to Lunch, consisting mostly of taking musical requests by e-mail and playing them. The show was canceled on August 21, 2003, with Stern turning it into a 45-minute segment at the end of his live broadcast that day by having WXRK program director Robert Cross (aka Chuck Roast) come in and break the bad news on the air to Melendez. Leaving the show In February 2004, the New York Post revealed that Melendez had been offered the announcer position on The Tonight Show while Stern's show was on vacation. Many perceived the move as an attempt by Leno to attract a younger demographic. Melendez's offer, which was made without Stern's knowledge, prompted a rift between Stern and Leno. Stern berated Leno on his show for weeks on end, with insults such as \\"To an 18- to 25-year-old male, Jay Leno is gay. He might as well put a dress on,\\" as well as accusations that Leno was \\"ripping him off.\\" Following Melendez's departure, Stern organized an on-air contest to find his replacement. Billed as \\"Win John's Job\\" (much like \\"Win Jackie's Money\\" after writer Jackie Martling walked out), the contest resulted in the hiring of Sal Governale (aka \\"Sal the Stockbroker\\") and Richard Christy. Although for several years, L.A. radio disc-jockey \\"Scary Gary\\" (from 97.1 KSLX, which played Stern's radio show in Southern California) did Stuttering John style interviews that Stern would play on his show. Also, in his latter years on the Stern show, John had become too recognizable for the amount of celebrity interviews he became niche-famous for. Comments since departure and relationship with Stern On February 27, 2008, more than four years removed from his time on The Howard Stern Show, Melendez was interviewed over the phone by Adam Carolla on his radio show with discussion of Melendez's 15 years as Stern's employee dominating the conversation. Carolla brought up the fact that on-air personnel on radio shows, even long-running hit shows, earn very low salaries compared to the show's host and wondered what kind of money Melendez made considering he was down in the show's pecking order, behind Stern, Robin Quivers, Fred, Jackie, and Gary. Melendez revealed that his first salary on The Howard Stern Show in 1990 was $10,000 per year before adding that, much to his disappointment, he only got an additional $10,000 per year once the show began to be broadcast on E! in 1994.Stuttering John on the Adam Carolla Show; February 27, 2008 Asked explicitly by Carolla if, considering that the station manager Tom Chiusano would not increase his salary, he ever thought, hoped or expected that Stern (who earned more than $20 million per year) would \\"kick something down to [him],\\" Melendez answered: In response, Stern devoted a 30-minute tirade to Melendez's comments with Carolla, calling the former employee a \\"no-talent ingrate\\" who should stick to holding up the mug on The Tonight Show, \\"I didn't have a beef with him before, but I do now. He's delusional. He can go fuck himself. I officially want nothing more to do with John. I've had it with him, and he's a talentless fuck. All he did was stutter. He just asked questions that we wrote for him.\\"Stern stuttering mad at John. New York Post, 2008-03-03. Retrieved on 2008-03-03. Commenting on Melendez's claim that Stern did not like him doing side gigs away from Howard's show such as stand-up, rock music and writing books. Stern retorted, \\"That's because they were horrible and he was slapping my name on them.\\" He also touched on the fact the Melendez's then-wife Suzanna and Stern's then-fianc√©e Beth are friends by saying he does not want them phoning each other anymore: \\"I'm going to have a talk with Beth about that\\". Stern also had choice words for Carolla over what he saw as a fellow radio host's attempt to get Melendez riled up: \\"He calls me 'Stern', and I'm not sure what that's about\\". =2004‚Äì2014: Jay Leno's shows= The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Melendez debuted on The Tonight Show on March 29, 2004, taking over for Edd Hall.The Tonight Show with Jay Leno: John Melendez as Announcer.

Throughout his first run on the Tonight Show, Melendez regularly appeared in the show's comedy sketches and did correspondent pieces.

Melendez announced in 2017 that he would be running for U.S. Senate for California against incumbent Dianne Feinstein for the 2018 election. Although it was later reported that he had withdrawn.  Podcast and prank call  In April 2018 he launched his new podcast, The Stuttering John Podcast. During Melendez's podcast on June 28, 2018, he prank-called the White House by pretending to be an assistant to Senator from New Jersey, Bob Menendez. Melendez ultimately received a call back from President Donald Trump as he was traveling on Air Force One. Melendez then impersonated Senator Menendez and had a four-minute conversation focusing on immigration reform and the Supreme Court vacancy. Notably, President Trump was congratulatory regarding the outcome of Senator Menendez's ethics lawsuit. The White House has confirmed the security breach. On July 2, 2018 Melendez announced that he had retained lawyer Michael Avenatti, to represent him in relation to the prank call after being visited by Secret Service agents over the previous weekend.  Published work  Melendez's book Easy for You to Say was released in October 2018. Personal life After moving to California in 2004 to work on The Tonight Show, Melendez resided in the city of Calabasas with his wife, Suzanna Keller, and their three children.

It concerned the day-to-day operation of legal firm MDA, which specialised in medical defence. Synopsis The title refers to the firm Medical Defence Australia, a team of lawyers and doctors who defend doctors charged with malpractice, ranging from Botox injections gone wrong to spinal cord injuries. The firm operates by collecting annual subscriptions from doctors, rather than on a case-by-case fee basis. The main characters in the pilot episode included Dr. Louella \\"Ella\\" Davis, the moral centre of the firm whose passion lies equally distributed between her work at St Albans Hospital Emergency Ward, and defending doctors; \\"Happy\\" Henderson, a lawyer whose nickname can be greatly misleading; Dr. Jamie Lawless, an optimistic young doctor whose passion for helping others often leads him to inner conflict; Caitlin King, the new law recruit at MDA whose ambitions far exceed what she can do at the firm; Layla Young of the Bah√°'√≠ faith, the friendly receptionist; Dr. Tony McKinnon, a doctor who works with Ella at the hospital; and Richard Savage - the cutthroat plaintiff's advocate who often does battles with MDA. MDA premiered in 2002 during a downturn in the making of Australian television. Despite critical acclaim and a number of awards, initially no renewal was made after the second season (2003). A year later, the ABC ordered another 12 episodes for 2005, but by this time several key actors had moved on. More multi-episode story arcs were used and critical response was lukewarm. Although sentiment eventually warmed, the series was not renewed after the third season. =Season 1= In the opening episodes, Ella faced personal problems when her lover Nick wished to move out of the country, and she often discussed these with her sister Edwina, but those characters quickly faded into the background. Edwina did return, for one episode, in the second season. The first episodes did not draw impressive ratings, and the critics were ambivalent, but by the eighth episode ‚Äì \\"Bowels, Bosch and the Whole Damn Thing\\", in which Happy faced health problems ‚Äì Jamie fell for Wendy Rossi, a doctor facing manslaughter, and Caitlin began to consider working with Richard instead of MDA ‚Äì the show began to gain attention. Other notable characters of the first season were Helena, a prosecutor whose lack of ability often led to comic relief moments; Claudia, Richard's sardonic barrister; Giles, the amiable old barrister contracted to MDA; Dr Vince Phillips, a doctor on the MDA board whose desire to take over led to a legal battle; and Dr Mark Matthews, the head of the MDA board. In the final episodes of the season, Ella and Tony became victims of a civil suit which led to them facing considerable press exposure. They were found not guilty, but in the final moments of the season finale, Divine intervention, angry plaintiff Debbie Shanahan drove her car directly at Jamie, Tony and Ella, and the audience was left to wonder who had survived. =Season 2= Although the ratings had been average, MDA was granted a second season. The second season improved markedly from the first season, tightening storylines and scripts. The season opened with the episode \\"Eternity\\" in which Tony died on the operating table, and Caitlin moved to Richard Savage's firm. Caitlin gets off to a bumpy start with the MDA when she becomes involved with Justin Harris (a man secretly under investigation for murder, played by Jeremy Callaghan). After Justin is cleared he feels that there is no trust in their relationship and leaves Caitlin. Two new characters joined: Amanda McKay, a legal case manager; and Simon Lloyd, a doctor joining MDA. Amanda and Simon's relationship evolves as a will-they-or-won't-they? couple of the show, with the risk increased due to his wife who worked abroad. By season's end they were a couple, but were still easing into it. Significant season two storylines included the destruction of Jamie and Wendy's relationship, Dr Phillips' increasing efforts to become head of MDA, and the potential destruction of MDA itself as he attempts to incite a revolution against the firm, Caitlin and Richard's personal and professional fighting, Layla's grandmother getting closer to death, and Happy dealing with his son Jason. In the second half of the season, Caitlin was written out of the show, as the producers decided her character had run its course. Kerry Armstrong also decided to leave - because the low Government funding for the arts in Australia under the Howard conservative government (often criticised within the industry) meant that appearing on one television show was not a sustainable income. Ella, subsequently, took a full-time posting at St. Albans' as Head of Emergency and only appeared occasionally during the latter half of season 2, making her final appearance in the penultimate episode \\"Pas de deux\\". Despite increased audience size, critical response, and award nominations, the ABC made no official announcement of the show's renewal. The final episode, \\"Memento Mori\\", aired on 17 December 2003. While it was no surprise that the ABC did not make an immediate announcement about the show's fate - many Australian television series will often miss a year due to actor's schedules and production demands - it was eight months before an announcement was made. During this time, Jason Donovan and Felix Nobis both moved on to other projects. =Season 3= In August 2004, the ABC finally announced its new commitment: a 12-episode order, which would air as three four-hour miniseries in 2005. While the order was small, the renewal meant that MDA was the only series to have started in 2002 which was still on the air as of 2005. The third season began on 30 June 2005, and was greeted with lacklustre ratings, despite an impressive guest cast. Critical response, initially negative, warmed as the season progressed, to the point where it was largely positive. * Episodes 1‚Äì4: Second chance. Facing a separation from his wife, Happy becomes enamored of a brilliant geneticist, Dr Robyn Masterson (Sigrid Thornton) whose controversial experiments are in danger of being shut down. While Happy's personal feelings lead him to champion her cause, he begins to discover that all is not as it seems. Meanwhile, Amanda investigates a separate case regarding Dr Masterson's lab assistant Julia (Anita Hegh); and Layla, Mark and Jamie fear for Happy's wellbeing. Aaron Blabey also stars as Dr. Masterson's assistant. As incident after incident befalls Robyn's team, she blames outside forces but some suspect that she herself isn't being honest with MDA, and ultimately Happy is forced to make the choice between his relationship with Robyn and the good of the company. Nicholas Hammond also guest stars in this episode. * Episodes 5‚Äì8: Departure lounge. With Jamie on holiday, MDA take on a temporary case manager, Dr Andrew Morello (Vince Colosimo), an anaesthetist with strong suspicions about the high rate of infant deaths at his hospital. So when he and Amanda assist Ted Walsh (Terry Brady), a prominent doctor with similar suspicions, Morello begins to investigate - which leads him to suspect prominent cardiologist Rupert Carr (Frank Gallacher). As Morello confides in Happy, he begins attempting to stop Carr's practices without coming out and speaking his mind, which will ultimately result in the end of both their careers. When Andrew goes up on his own charges, Happy recalls Jamie back to MDA so that Andrew can be dismissed. As everyone including MDA turns against him, news about his wife Lucy (Jane Allsop) ultimately compels Andrew to make a final decision. Meanwhile, Amanda goes up against Gabrielle Bromley (Wendy Hughes), a fierce prosecuting attorney. * Episodes 9‚Äì12: A human cost. Happy has a sudden angina attack, and while in an outer suburban hospital befriends intern Dr Liz Gibson (Lisa McCune). The next day, Gibson becomes the subject of a medical negligence writ. Concerned that her boss, Meg Morrison (Louise Siversen), and her nemesis, nurse Chloe Davis (Jacinta Stapleton) are teaming up against her, Liz seeks Happy's assistance. Even though both Amanda and Liz herself have doubts about her competence, Happy stands by her. However, when Jamie and Layla discover just how understaffed and incompetently run Prospect Valley Hospital is, they realise that someone might be making Liz a scapegoat to cover up greater crimes. Elsewhere, Amanda goes up against a Health Review Board manager, David Simpson (Erik Thomson) in court, only to find herself in a passionate relationship with him outside of work. But when she learns that he may be behind the plot to convict Liz, Amanda is put into a devastating conflict of interest. Things come to a head when Liz and her boyfriend - fellow intern Dr Tim Whitney (Paul Bishop) - must both be protected against the schemes at the hospital, and as Happy fights with Amanda over the case, his health takes a serious turn for the worse.

Curtis began as an apothecary, before turning his attention to botany and other natural history. The publications he prepared reached a wider audience than early works on the subject had intended. At the age of 25 he produced Instructions for collecting and preserving insects; particularly moths and butterflies.Instructions for collecting and preserving insects; particularly moths and butterflies.

He established his own London Botanic Garden at Lambeth in 1779, moving to Brompton in 1789. He published Flora Londinensis (6 volumes, 1777‚Äì1798), a pioneering work in that it devoted itself to urban nature. Financial success was not found, but he went on the publish The Botanical Magazine in 1787, a work that would also feature hand coloured plates by artists such as James Sowerby and Sydenham Edwards.

The genus Curtisia is named in his honour. His publication was continued as the esteemed botanical publication, Curtis's Botanical Magazine. The noted natural history illustrators, James Sowerby and Sydenham Edwards both found a start with the eminent magazine.

The town has two beaches (Itzurun and Santiago), which are of interest to geologists because they are situated among the longest set of continuous rock strata in the world. Known locally as the \\"flysch\\" they date from the mid- cretaceous period to the present, a time period of over 100 million years. The K-T boundary is present at the Itzurun beach, and fossils can be found, notably of ammonites. The strata stretches along a distance of about 8 km, between the towns/beaches of Deba and Getaria, with Zumaia lying in the middle. The town is also the home/museum of the painter Ignacio Zuloaga. Exhibits include works by El Greco, Rivera, Zurbar√°n and Goya. Across the street there is a museum of craft and hand-crafted products of Laia. Within the city centre, the Basque-style Gothic church of San Pedro can be found. It has a temple with a magnificent reredos by Juan de Antxieta, the only work by this Basque sculptor found in Gipuzkoa. Zumaia is located at the point where the Urola and Narrondo rivers come together. The origins of the town can be traced by its ancient monastery. In the Middle Ages, the people who lived in the Sehatz valley having to endure the continuous attacks of pirates and pillagers, fortified the city. The church today retains the relic of its defensive appearance. Toponym According to the toponym of Zumaia, the theory that the name comes from \\"zuma\\" or \\"zume\\", a Basque word used to designate to the wicker, plant that apparently was plentiful in the zone, is highly defended. And with regards to Villagrana, there is a theory that states the possibility to be related with \\"grana\\", meaning \\"seeding\\", that were produced by the abundant groves of evergreen oaks in that period. History of Zumaia =Creation of the town= Despite the disagreements in certain aspects with regards to the origins of Zumaia, all historians agree that the villa emerged surrounding the Monastery of Santa Maria. According to the first preserved parchment in which is mentioned the place \\"Zumaya\\", the Monastery of Santa Maria had been a donation by a privilege of Sancho VI of Navarre to the Roncesvalles's convent in 1292. Despite the different conclusions about the emplacement of the monastery, the monks of the Monastery of Santa Maria the direct witnesses of the birth of this villa, after the inhabitants dispersed by the valley of Sehatz decided to put an end to the continuous assaults of piracy and plunder and raise a villa walled and strengthened from where they could defend in group against the enemy. Due to its extent, its strategic location and its direct contact with the sea, the chosen place was Zumaia. Nevertheless, the villa was not constituted juridically until 1347, when Alfonso XI of Castile provided the municipal charter to its citizens of \\"Villagrana de Zumaya's Villa\\", to which was granted the Jurisdiction of San Sebasti√°n. In the 16th century, Zumaia relied on 136 houses, 70 of them distributed among six streets that existed inside the wall, and the remaining ones dispersed by three neighborhoods that were staying out of the wall. In total there were 108 neighborhood surnames, 53 of them with the qualification of nobility. Nowadays there is no evidence of the fortification that only was interrupted at a height of solar houses and towers that could play the same function of defending as the wall. The entrance halls included the Principal Entrance Hall of the villa and the great cross that presided over them. They were destroyed in the middle of the 18th century in order to clear the surroundings of the town. The only natural door was the one of the bar of the sea, which was apparently the most dangerous for being the most accessible. From the 16th century, the metal of the bells of the parish have been fused countless times. In 1578 the mayor ordered to ring them three times consecutively so that citizens were well-informed and came more assiduously to the meetings of the regiment, which was retired long time ago. Moreover, on the eve of the General Meetings - that were celebrated in the villa every 18 years, to offer fuel-wood and coal to the secretary of the province - two oaks were cut. In one of these sessions, on December 27, 1620, the same day in which Ignatius of Loyola, Patron Saint of Gipuzkoa was chosen, the patron saint of the town was named as the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. =Economic changes and development= With the pass of centuries, has brought logically many changes not only in the former ordinances municipal written in 1584, but also in the urban development as well as in the customs and way of living of citizens. However, the best keys to notice the development of the villa from its foundation to the present day, is the economic predominant activity of every epoch. The majority of the first inhabitants of the villa were devoted to agriculture, though grouping in the same place accelerated the appearance of some professional and industrial activities. By the end of the 14th century, ships were constructed in the river. A high percentage of the population was devoted to fishing and navigation. The river was then very rich and many species could be fished, among them salmon, trout, shellfish and eels. Many were reconciling the coastal fishing with agriculture. By then, the manufacturing of cement had also become a relevant activity, for which they were taking advantage of the matters of tertiary areas of the surroundings. From the port they were departing goods towards the Netherlands as well as manufactured products were imported. Some historians even claim that the passenger liner that was joining the villa with the hermitage of Santiago - habitual accommodation of the pilgrims who were going towards Santiago de Compostela, were also among the most prominent sources of Zumaia's revenue in the 16th century. The following centuries, 17th century and the 18th century, were not brilliant periods at all. The land continued being the principal economic activity of the neighbors, in spite of the fact that Zumaia continued having many deficits in agriculture, especially in the production of wheat, corn and beans; until that in 1766 all the houses were recognized to verify if any neighbor possessed more grain than the necessary for their maintenance. There were also citizens dedicated to both maritime and terrestrial transport of goods, mainly iron, and the fishing activity was maintained and even increased, since in 1610 was created the Cofrad√≠a de Mareantes de San Telmo, meaning the Confraternity of the Seagoing of San Telmo. It was in this period when there was emphasized the emigration begun at the end of the 16th century (in 1616 Zumaia embraced 935 inhabitants) and it did not stop until two centuries later with the economic reappearance. The situation began to improve very quickly in the 17th century , among other reasons because the desiccation of the marshes enabled the cultivation of the former reed-beds and, consequently, the increase of the agricultural production, especially if corn. But there were some other factors that lead this reappearance, since in the 19th century the factories of cement turned into the engine of the economy of the villa, promoting the commercial activity of the port. The terrestrial transport also improved in this period of time, since between the year 1882 and 1885 a road that joined Zumaia with Getaria was created, which was already communicated with San Sebasti√°n, in 1900 appeared a train that would join Zumaia with Zarautz, and in 1926 the railroad of the Urola was inaugurated, which nowadays is already removed. The improvement of the communications, nevertheless, harmed to the port of Bedua, whose commercial activity started to expire due to the fact that the bridge of Urola river was blocking the way to the ships upstream. The industry of the cement began to decline at the beginning of the 20th century, at the same time as the naval industry started to arise again strongly, and soon later also the industry of the engine. An interesting fact that took place in Zumaia is that the first diesel engine of the whole Spanish State was set here, precisely in the enterprise Yeregui Hermanos. This industrial rise brought about logically a considerable increase of the population, mainly due to the immigration. The percentages of the different activities that were stimulating the economy of Zumaia had considerably changed by the beginning of the 20th century. In 1950, the 56,1% of the population worked in the industrial sector, while only the 17% dedicated to agriculture. Some years later, the economic crisis also came to Zumaia, sharpened by moments with readjustment of personnel and even with the closing of some big workshops that had been emblematic until then. Today, fifty years later, several more modest companies have been created, which are also more chords with the new economic trends of the market. View from Zumaia. Lighthouse of Zumaia. Itzurun Beach. Zumaia and the octopus The Octopus and Zumaia have been together since the early days of the creation of the town. There has been a special relation between this animal and the town in which other towns, in Getaria, Zarautz or Deba (which they are 5, 10 and 16 km from Zumaia), has never occurred. The tradition of catching octopuses on the coastline of Zumaia has been very typical, and the octopus has become the essence of the culture and tradition of the town. =Fishing the octopus= There are 3 main places in Zumaia where people catch octopuses: The rocks of Itzurun beach, Inpernupe, and the coastline between Zumaia and Deba. The ideal moment is when the tide is not high. There have to be visible rocks to catch them, since the octopuses are hidden in the holes which the rocks usually have. So, the more rocks are visible, the more chances are to catch them. The hunt requires a fish hook to grab the octopus. But, there are different techniques, and they change according to the place: 1-Looking the remains of crabs and other small sea animals in the entrance of the holes (so, there is a signal that the octopus is inside that hole) and catching them with a hook. 2-Using a stick covered with bait to attract octopuses and, when they are visible, which they do not leave the hole if there is no bait, grab them with the hook. Fishing octopuses has been a tradition in Zumaia. But, not all the people can catch them easily. There are some families where the tradition is strong. Some individuals had caught 100 in a day. But, they were other times, when there were many more octopuses than nowadays. The pollution, the fishing vessels and the non-limit octopus fishing years have been very prejudicial to the coastline. Because of this, the government has regulated the amount that one individual can catch (one octopus and heavier than 750 g). Every year when there are big tides a lot of people usually go the coastline to fish for octopus, and as some of them are experienced, they fish more than 20 octopuses on a day. Nowadays, it is illegal to fish more than one per day, but some people (specially the old people who have been fishing all their lives) still fish a lot of them. The octopus cannot be eaten after it is fished. It has to be treated, but there are different ways to treat it. And, the way it is cooked depends on who it is treated after fishing it. The octopus is a strong animal, and if it is eaten immediately after it is fished it is very hard to eat as it is not tender enough to eat. So, it has to tenderized in the freezer for one week or more. But, Zumaia and the octopus have been related by many years, and the freezer is a relatively new item. So, how it was preserved or treated after it was fished? If the octopus is fresh, and it is tenderized after a lot of hits, it is cooked with tomatoes, a la gallega or with peppers and onion. But, those cooking recipes are very common in other places like Asturias or Galicia, where there are traditions of fishing and cooking octopuses. It was and still is common to cook in those ways. But, there is a recipe, which it needs dry octopus, that it is exclusively from Zumaia. In other towns near Zumaia there is not this tradition. =Drying the octopus= Drying octopuses is not very common in the places where there is a tradition to fish octopuses, but in Zumaia has been very typical to dry the octopuses. The process of drying is as follows: 1- After the octopus is dead, the octopus has to be cleaned and only the meat of the octopus is preserved. 2- The octopus is put in a plastic bucket and it is kept there for 3‚Äì5 days. 3- The octopus has to be put up in a stick, and leave it for other 7‚Äì8 days. 4- When the octopus is dry, without any water inside it, the process is finished. When the octopus is dry, the size of the octopus is reduced up to five times. So, if the octopus is 1 kg, after the drying, the octopus will be 200 g. The drying process is unique and exotic, but the dry octopus smells very strongly. Some people, mostly foreigners, cannot smell it. But for the people of Zumaia, this process of drying is part of the tradition of older generations.

It is credited with introducing Zen to Western audiences in the late 1940s and 1950s. Origin Herrigel (1884‚Äì1955) was a German professor of philosophy, with a special interest in mysticism. From 1924 to 1929 he taught philosophy in Japan, and studied Ky≈´d≈ç (the art of the Japanese bow) under a master named Awa Kenz√¥. Awa taught ky≈´d≈ç in a way that was regarded by some as a mystical religion, called Daishadokyo. Daishadokyo was an approach to ky≈´d≈ç that placed great emphasis on the spiritual aspect and differed from much of the mainstream practice at the time. In 1936, Herrigel wrote a 20-page essay about his experiences, and then in 1948 expanded the essay into a short book. The book was translated into English in 1953 and Japanese in 1955. Book The book sets forth theories about motor learning. Herrigel has an accepting spirit towards and about unconscious control of outer activity that Westerners heretofore considered to be wholly under conscious-waking control and direction. For example, a central idea in the book is how through years of practice, a physical activity becomes effortless both mentally and physically, as if our physical memory (today known as \\"muscle memory\\") executes complex and difficult movements without conscious control from the mind. Herrigel describes Zen in archery as follows: :\\"(...) The archer ceases to be conscious of himself as the one who is engaged in hitting the bull's-eye which confronts him. This state of unconscious is realized only when, completely empty and rid of the self, he becomes one with the perfecting of his technical skill, though there is in it something of a quite different order which cannot be attained by any progressive study of the art (...)\\" Influence Herrigel's book may have inspired Tim Gallwey's 1974 book The Inner Game of Tennis. Both Herrigel and Gallwey approach sport and life as opportunities for learning inner cooperation. Zen in the Art of Archery also relates to the \\"inner child\\" idea in humanistic psychology. Later literature either discusses balancing the \\"inner game\\" and the \\"outer game\\" or counseling approaches to accessing, communicating and collaborating with the inner child beyond sports. The title \\"Zen in the Art of Archery\\" most likely inspired the titles of many other works, either directly or indirectly. Foremost among these is Robert Pirsig's 1974 book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. More than 200 works have been created with similar titles, including Ray Bradbury's 1990 book Zen in the Art of Writing, as well as Zen and the Art of Poker, Zen and the Art of Knitting, Crazy Legs Conti: Zen and the Art of Competitive Eating, and so on. J. D. Salinger's fictional character Seymour Glass applied one aspect of Zen archery‚Äîaiming by deliberately not taking aim‚Äîto playing the children's game of marbles. The wider theme of many of these works is that a regular routine can have a spiritual dimension. Criticism Both Arthur Koestler and Gershom Sholem accused Herrigel's book of being influenced and justifying the politics of the Nazi party on the pages of Encounter magazin Gershom Scholem, 'Zen-Nazism,' Encounter Vol.16 February 1961 p.96 . Sholem also accuses Herrigel's widow of editing his writing and hiding the fact that he was an active member of the Nazi party and the Nazi organization the Militant League for German Culture. Others, such as Shoji Yamada in his book \\"shots in the dark\\", claims that many of the conversations between Herrigel and Awa Kenzo were altered or completely fabricated by the author.

Brock published ten volumes of poetry from 1959 through his death in 1997. Two of Brock's poems In particular -- Five Ways to Kill a Man (1972) and Song of the Battery Hen (1977) -- have been heavily anthologized. Early life Brock was born in Dulwich, London, in 1927. He grew up in a working-class family with no literary aspirations. He won a scholarship to a local grammar school but his formal education ended after he gained his School Certificate. Brock's interest in poetry was inspired by a paperback anthology of modern verse which he picked up idly as a bored 18-year-old, waiting to be de-mobbed from the Royal Navy at the end of the Second World War. This chance encounter in Hong Kong was to prove revelatory and from then on Brock, completely self-taught, began to write his own poems. Professional life Gradually Brock started to be published, firstly in the smaller magazines and eventually in the Times Literary Supplement. During this period, Brock served as a police officer in the Metropolitan force, the unusual combination of policeman and poet giving rise to a brief period of fame when a tabloid journalist published an interview with Brock under the banner headline: \\"THE THINGS HE THINKS UP AS HE POUNDS THE PECKHAM BEAT\\". Brock was embarrassed by the sudden attention, but he continued to pursue his writing with serious intent. His efforts bore fruit when his first collection was accepted by the small but prestigious Scorpion Press in 1959. Its title, An Attempt at Exorcism, touches on the essentially personal nature of Brock's work, the frankness of which connects him to the Confessional Movement which at that time was in the ascendancy in the United States. Indeed, Brock is one of the few British poets of this period to be known in America, with New Directions publishing several of his collections. Brock left the police to become an advertising copywriter, a profession which he claimed to despise, but in which he became very successful creating the famous strapline for the UK Financial Times newspaper of 'No FT. No comment'. Brock resented the way work distracted him from his real creative life in poetry, but he continued to write alongside his career, publishing over a dozen collections and becoming increasingly prolific toward the end of his life. He was also editor of the poetry magazine, Ambit, for almost four decades. In 1966 his status was recognised by his inclusion in the influential Penguin Modern Poets series together with Geoffrey Hill and Stevie Smith. Personal life Brock married Patricia Weller (Nellie V. Weller, born 1930, died 2020) in 1949, with whom he had a son and daughter. The marriage proved to be an unhappy one and was dissolved in 1964. The traumatic experience of marital conflict and divorce permeated his poetry at the time, for instance in the bitter and powerful An Arrangement for Seeing Children. In 1964, Brock married Elizabeth Skilton to whom he remained married for 33 years until his death. Brock died on 7 September 1997 in Norfolk, England. .  Titles  Brocapps listed ten volumes of poetry collections, a novel and an autobiography. Brock wrote two of the best-known poems of the last century, Five Ways to Kill a Man and Song of the Battery Hen, but his work deserves wider recognition beyond these anthology favourites. Brock's poems amply demonstrate the virtues of his \\"intensely felt, supple, direct and memorable work.\\" Five Ways to Kill a Man is chilling in its deliberately emotionless tone as it uses the language of a practical manual to explore humanity's cruelty. Progress is reduced to the way in which mankind has \\"improved\\" its methods of killing. Inspired by a performance of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem and written quickly, the poem has an air of authority which Brock's reading emphasises. Song of the Battery Hen is similarly suited to being spoken aloud. Though written as a dramatic monologue, in his introduction Brock makes it clear the poem has autobiographical resonance. As such it is a good example of his belief that \\"most activity is an attempt to define oneself in one way or another: for me poetry, and only poetry, has provided this self- defining act.\\". Brock's works include: *An Attempt at Exorcism (poetry collection, 1959) *The Little White God (novel, 1962) *\\"A Cold Day At The Zoo\\" (1970) *\\"Invisibility Is The Art Of Survival\\" (1972) *\\"I Never Saw It Lit\\" (chapbook, 1974) *\\"Paroxisms\\" (1974) *\\"The Blocked Heart\\" (1976) *Here, Now, Always (autobiography, 1977) *\\"Song of the Battery Hen: Selected Poems\\" (1977) *\\"The River & The Train\\" (1979) *\\"Five Ways To Kill A Man: New and Selected Poems\\" (1990) *\\"And Another Thing\\" (1999) References External links * Obituary: Edwin Brock Accessed 2009-12-27 * Edwin Brock Accessed 2009-12-27 Category:1927 births Category:1997 deaths Category:People from Dulwich Category:Writers from London Category:Royal Navy personnel of World War II Category:20th-century English poets ","title":"Edwin Brock"},{"id":"892215","text":"Corrib has multiple meanings.

In Irish it is sometimes called An Ghaillimh (\\"the Galway\\") and also incorrectly called Abhainn na Coiribe. The legend concerning its naming states that it was called after Gaillimh inion Breasail, the daughter of a Fir Bolg chieftain who drowned in the river. The word Gaillimh is believed to mean \\"stony\\" as in \\"stony river\\". The commonly held myth that the city takes its name from the Irish word Gallaibh, \\"foreigners\\" i.e. \\"the town of the foreigners\\" (from Gall, a foreigner) is incorrect as the name Gaillimh was applied to the river first and then later onto the town. Indeed, the earliest settlement at Galway was called D√∫n Bhun na Gaillimhe, or \\"the fort at the end of the Galway (river)\\". Kayaking the large standing wave at O'Briens Bridge The river gave its name to the town, which grew to a city, and from c. 1570 onwards, the city gave its name to the county. It also aided massively in the industrial development of the town, allowing it to develop electrical power before London. At the height of water power, there were over twenty water wheels in operation from races built on the river and its accompanying cut, the Eglinton Canal, which was built as part of the \\"Drainage and Navigation scheme of Lough Carra, Lough Corrib and Lough Mask\\" in the mid-19th century. The canal, which is about three-quarters of a mile long, had a sea-lock, a large basin, a second lock at Parkavore and five swivelling bridges. It is still in water but the swivelling bridges have been replaced by fixed bridges; the last vessel to use the navigation was the Amo II, a 90' motor-yacht that had been sold by the Guinness trustees to Frank Bailey, a Galway hotelier.Maurice Semple Reflections on Lough Corrib, self-published, 2nd ed 1989 Lough Corrib is the anglicised form of Loch Coirib which itself is a corruption of Loch nOrbsean which, according to placename lore, is named after the Irish god of the sea. There is good fishing to be had on both the lake and river. Ptolemy's Geography (2nd century AD) described a river called ŒëœÖœÉŒøŒ≤Œ± (Ausoba) which probably referred to the River Corrib.http://www.romaneranames.uk/essays/ireland.pdf =Upper and Lower Corrib= The Friars' Cut The part of the river that flows from the southern end of the lake to the Salmon Weir is known as the Upper Corrib. The weir, a set of weir gates also built during the above navigation scheme, was originally built from stone and timber but now only two of these gates remain and are only opened in times of flood. The rest have been replaced by fourteen steel gates, as shown in the photograph above. The main channel leaving Lough Corrib is called Friars' Cut or Friars' River () as it is the result of a very early piece of canal engineering. In 1178 the friars of Claregalway Abbey, being tired of the long detour they had to make to the west to enter the river, asked permission from the Blakes of Menloe to make an artificial cut, which in time became the main course of the river and was then widened. The section of the river that runs from the Salmon Weir through Galway city and out into Galway Bay is known as the Lower Corrib. Three bridges cross the Lower ‚Äì the Salmon Weir Bridge, William O'Brien Bridge and Wolfe Tone Bridge. The only tributary of the Lower Corrib is Sruth√°n na gCaisle√°in (Castle Stream) known by whitewater kayakers as the Shit Chute and the access point to the river, a small stream that flows through Newcastle, the grounds of NUI Galway, and empties into the Lower just downstream of King's weir, commonly known as the fish gates.

Most characteristically, markers occur as clitics or inflectional affixes. In analytic languages and agglutinative languages, markers are generally easily distinguished. In fusional languages and polysynthetic languages, this is often not the case. For example, in Latin, a highly fusional language, the word amo (\\"I love\\") is marked by suffix -o for indicative mood, active voice, first person, singular, present tense. Analytic languages tend to have a relatively limited number of markers. Markers should be distinguished from the linguistic concept of markedness. An unmarked form is the basic \\"neutral\\" form of a word, typically used as its dictionary lemma, such as‚Äîin English‚Äîfor nouns the singular (e.g. cat versus cats), and for verbs the infinitive (e.g. to eat versus eats, ate and eaten). Unmarked forms (e.g. the nominative case in many languages) tend to be less likely to have markers, but this is not true for all languages (compare Latin). Conversely, a marked form may happen to have a zero affix, like the genitive plural of some nouns in Russian (e.g. —Å–∞–ø–æ–≥). In some languages, the same forms of a marker have multiple functions, such as when used in different cases or declensions (for example -is in Latin).

Tanngrisnir (Old Norse \\"teeth-barer, snarler\\") and Tanngnj√≥str (Old Norse \\"teeth grinder\\") are the goats who pull the god Thor's chariot in Norse mythology. They are attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. The Prose Edda relates that when Thor cooks the goats, their flesh provides sustenance for the god, and, after Thor resurrects them with his hammer, Mj√∂lnir, they are brought back to life the next day. According to the same source, Thor once stayed a night at the home of peasant farmers and shared with them his goat meal, yet one of their children, √ûj√°lfi, broke one of the bones to suck out the marrow, resulting in the lameness of one of the goats upon resurrection. As a result, Thor maintains √ûj√°lfi and his sister R√∂skva as his servants. Scholars have linked the ever-replenishing goats to the nightly-consumed beast S√¶hr√≠mnir in Norse mythology and Scandinavian folk beliefs involving herring bones and witchcraft. Etymology The Old Norse name Tanngrisnir translates to \\"teeth- barer, snarler\\" and Tanngnj√≥str to \\"teeth-grinder\\". Scholar Rudolf Simek comments that the names were young when recorded, and may have been inventions of Snorri.Simek (2007:310). Tanngnj√≥str is sometimes modernly anglicized as Tanngiost.As can be seen in Faulkes (1995:254). Attestations =Poetic Edda= Thor notices that one of his goats has a lame leg in an illustration (1895) by Lorenz Fr√∏lich Thor's goats are mentioned in two poems in the Poetic Edda, though they are not referred to by name. In the Poetic Edda poem Hymiskvi√∞a, Thor secures the goats, described as having \\"splendid horns\\", with a human named Egil in the realm of Midgard before Thor and the god Tyr continue to the j√∂tunn Hymir's hall.Larrington (1999:79). Later in the same poem Thor is referred to as \\"lord of goats\\".Larrington (1999:81. After having killed Hymir and his many-headed army, Thor's goats collapse, \\"half-dead\\", due to lameness. The poem says that this is the fault of Loki, yet that \\"you have heard this already\\", and that another, wiser than the poet, could tell the story of how Thor was repaid by a lava-dweller with his children.Larrington (1999:83). A stanza from the Poetic Edda poem √ûrymskvi√∞a describes Thor's goat-driven ride to J√∂tunheimr: > {  :Benjamin Thorpe translation: :Straightway were the goats homeward > driven, :hurried to the traces; they had fast to run. :The rocks were > shivered, the earth was in a blaze; :Odin's son drove to J√∂tunheim.Thorpe > (1866:64-65).  :Henry Adams Bellows translation: :Then home the goats to > the hall were driven, :They wrenched at the halters, swift were they to run; > :The mountains burst, earth burned with fire, :And Odin's son sought > Jotunheim.Belows (1823:179).  } =Prose Edda= In chapter 21 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure of High divulges that the god Thor has two goats that drive his chariot and that these goats bear the names Tanngnj√≥str and Tanngrisnir.Faulkes (1995:22). In chapter 44, the enthroned figure of Third reluctantly relates a tale in which Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, pulled by his two goats. Loki and Thor stop at the home of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, skins them and puts them in a pot. When the goats are cooked, Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family to share the meal with him and they do so.Faulkes (1995:38). Thor (1910) by Johannes Gehrts At the end of the meal, Thor places the skins of the goat on the opposing side of the fire and tells the peasants to throw the bones of the goats on to the goatskins. The peasant's son √ûj√°lfi takes one of the goat ham- bones and uses a knife to split it open, breaking the bone to get to the marrow.Faulkes (1995:38). After staying the night at the peasants house, Thor wakes up and gets dressed before the break of dawn. Thor takes his hammer Mj√∂llnir, raises it, and blesses the goat skins. Resurrected, the goats stand, but one of the two goats is lame in the hind leg. Noting this new lameness, Thor exclaims that someone has mistreated the bones of his goats; that someone broke the ham-bone during the meal the night before. Third notes that there is no need to draw out the tale, for: > :Everyone can imagine how terrified the peasant must have been when he saw > Thor making his brows sink down over his eyes; as for what could be seen of > the eyes themselves, he thought he would collapse at just the very sight. > Thor clenched his hands on the shaft of the hammer so that the knuckles went > white, and the peasant did as one might expect, and all his household, they > cried out fervently, begged for grace, offered to atone with all their > possessions. At realizing how terrified he has made the peasants, Thor calms down and from them accepted a settlement of their children √ûj√°lfi and R√∂skva. The two children become his servants and have remained so since. Leaving the goats behind, the four then set out for the land of J√∂tunheimr. The goats are again mentioned in chapter 48, where Thor is described as setting out to Midgard, the realm of mankind, in the form of a young boy, without goats or companions.Faulkes (1995:46). In chapter 75 of the Prose Edda book Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, the names of both goats appear among a list of names for goats.Faulkes (1995:164). Theories and interpretations Scholar Rudolf Simek connects Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj√≥str with the beast S√¶hr√≠mnir (consumed nightly by the gods and the einherjar and rejuvenated every day), noting that this may point to sacrificial rites in shamanic practices.Simek (2007:273). In Scandinavian folklore, witches who magically replenish food sometimes appear in tales, the food usually being herring. However, in fear that one would waste away if one were fed the same morsel again and again, folk tales describe the breaking of the herring bones when eating it as a form of precaution. Thematic similarities‚Äîbone breaking ending food rejuvenation‚Äîbetween this folk belief and the Old Norse tales of Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj√≥str have led scholars Reimund Kvideland and Henning Sehmsdorf to highlight a connection between the two.Kvideland and Sehmsdorf (2010:170). Modern influence In the Marvel Comics adaptation of the god, Thor usually relies on his hammer to fly. However, in situations where he must transport passengers and/or objects, Thor can summon Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj√≥str, who arrive already harnessed to his chariot, and can be dismissed with equal ease.Simonson, Walt. Thor, \\"Something Old, Something New\\". Marvel Comics, 1984, vol. 1, #339 The two goats were vital in a later Marvel Comics story; they believed a tale of danger to Odin and summoned reinforcements. They later made sure various Asgardian children were safe when an invading army threatened.\\"New Mutants\\" vol. 1 #83-87 (1989-1990) In the Yu-Gi-Oh Trading Card Game, both Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj√≥str are represented as \\"Nordic Beast\\" Monster Cards. They are meant to be used in conjunction with other cards representative of other characters and creatures from Norse mythology, including their master Thor. In Rick Riordan's book Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard: The Sword of Summer, both Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj√≥str appeared. They are called Marvin and Otis, respectively, on the book and they are commonly sacrificed by the god Thor, to be reborn the next day. In the 2018 video-game God of War, the Grip of Tanngiost is a blade pommel that causes shock damage, which can be used on the Leviathan Axe. Both goats appear in the Danish Valhalla comics series, and the animated feature based on it. The god Thor butcher and cooks one of the rams but strongly warns against breaking the bones. Loki persuades Tjalfe (√ûj√°lfi) into sucking the marrow from a leg bone from one of the goats. When Thor resurrects the goats the next morning, he finds that one of the goats is lame in the leg and becomes enraged. As a result, Thor maintains Tjalfe and his sister as his servants.

It is a linear park of some , and was created on industrial land devastated by World War II bombing. Some of the park is within Limehouse and Globe Town, with the park lying on land to the east of the Regent's Canal. In the north, it is separated from the southern edge of Victoria Park by the Hertford Union Canal. It is open 24 hours a day. The Green Bridge carries Mile End Park over the Mile End Road A plan existed from the end of the war to create the park, but extensive development did not begin until the end of the millennium. A pedestrian bridge, opened in July 1999, was built over the Mile End Road, which bisects the park, near Mile End tube station. The bridge was designed by Piers Gough.Mile End Park (Case study) accessed 7 Nov 2007 Prior to the park's construction, 193 Grove Road - at the edge of the park - was transformed by sculptor Rachel Whiteread into a cast of its interior. This work won her the Turner Prize in 1993. In 1381, 60,000 Men of Essex camped here and met Richard II at Mile End, on 14 June 1381, during the Peasants' Revolt.Alastair Dunn (2002), The Great Rising of 1381: The Peasant's Revolt and England's Failed Revolution, The park now consists of a number of elements (running north‚Äìsouth): The Play Arena - for children, The Ecology Park - including a lake, an ecology building, wind turbine and climbing wall, The Arts Park, The Green Bridge, The Terraced Garden, The South Park, Adventure Park, Sports Park - including the Mile End stadium, Kirk's Place and The Children's Park. Nearby are an extreme sports centre and an electric Go kart track. The Ragged School Museum opened in 1990 in three canal side former warehouses in Copperfield Road. It faces the western edge of the park south of Mile End Road. The buildings previously housed Dr Barnado's Copperfield Road Ragged School. The park has been awarded the London First Award, the Green bridge the Institution of Civil Engineers Award of Merit, a commendation at the British Construction Industry Awards and a special commendation from the Prime Minister's Award. Mile End Stadium Mile End Park Mile End Stadium, situated at the south end of the park, underwent refurbishment which was completed in 2005. A new sport and fitness centre, the Mile End Park Leisure Centre was built adjacent to the Stadium and opened in 2006. It houses a four- court sports hall, two swimming pools (including one competition standard pool), state-of-the-art fitness studios, and a health suite and sauna.

It is well known as the subject of the folk song of the same name, featuring Uncle Tom Cobley and his friends.  History  The earliest written record was in 1850, when it was described in the Plymouth Gazette as a cattle fair. It soon became an opportunity to show and sell other livestock, particularly locally-bred sheep and Dartmoor ponies, and by the 1920s it had also become a sports day for local schoolchildren. In 1933, stalls were introduced, selling rural arts and crafts. Widecombe Fair was suspended during the Second World War, but reinstated in 1945 with new attractions, including a gymkhana and tug of war. All profits were donated to the 'Local Welcome Home Fund' for returning soldiers, sailors and airmen. In 1989, it was decided to cancel the pony classes following an outbreak of Equine flu (these were replaced with terrier races, which have continued ever since). The Fair was cancelled altogether in 2001 due to the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease. However, despite these interruptions, the event has steadily grown in size and reputation. In its earlier years, it was held in various locations around the village, including the village green. Today, however, it occupies a large field to the south of Widecombe (known to locals as The Fair Field). Other fields become car parks, and a complex policing and marshalling system is put in place, with the narrow lanes transformed into a one-way road system. Today's visitors will still see displays of quality livestock, although there are many other attractions, including: a dog show, displays of local produce, vintage farm machinery, rural arts and crafts, bale tossing and a now traditional appearance by \\"Uncle Tom Cobley\\": a local resident in fancy dress, riding a grey mare.

For road vehicles with more than two axles (e.g. some trucks), the wheelbase is the distance between the steering (front) axle and the centerpoint of the driving axle group. In the case of a tri-axle truck, the wheelbase would be the distance between the steering axle and a point midway between the two rear axles.ISO 8855:2011, 4.2  Vehicles  The wheelbase of a vehicle equals the distance between its front and rear wheels. At equilibrium, the total torque of the forces acting on a vehicle is zero. Therefore, the wheelbase is related to the force on each pair of tires by the following formula: :F_f = {d_r \\\\over L}mg :F_r = {d_f \\\\over L}mg where F_f is the force on the front tires, F_r is the force on the rear tires, L is the wheelbase, d_r is the distance from the center of mass (CM) to the rear wheels, d_f is the distance from the center of gravity to the front wheels (d_f \\\\+ d_r = L), m is the mass of the vehicle, and g is the gravity constant. So, for example, when a truck is loaded, its center of gravity shifts rearward and the force on the rear tires increases. The vehicle will then ride lower. The amount the vehicle sinks will depend on counter acting forces, like the size of the tires, tire pressure, and the spring rate of the suspension. If the vehicle is accelerating or decelerating, extra torque is placed on the rear or front tire respectively. The equation relating the wheelbase, height above the ground of the CM, and the force on each pair of tires becomes: :F_f = {d_r \\\\over L}mg - {h_{cm} \\\\over L}ma :F_r = {d_f \\\\over L}mg + {h_{cm} \\\\over L}ma where F_f is the force on the front tires, F_r is the force on the rear tires, d_r is the distance from the CM to the rear wheels, d_f is the distance from the CM to the front wheels, L is the wheelbase, m is the mass of the vehicle, g is the acceleration of gravity (approx. 9.8 m/s2), h_{cm} is the height of the CM above the ground, a is the acceleration (or deceleration if the value is negative). So, as is common experience, when the vehicle accelerates, the rear usually sinks and the front rises depending on the suspension. Likewise, when braking the front noses down and the rear rises.: Because of the effect the wheelbase has on the weight distribution of the vehicle, wheelbase dimensions are crucial to the balance and steering. For example, a car with a much greater weight load on the rear tends to understeer due to the lack of the load (force) on the front tires and therefore the grip (friction) from them. This is why it is crucial, when towing a single-axle caravan, to distribute the caravan's weight so that down-thrust on the tow- hook is about 100 pounds force (400 N). Likewise, a car may oversteer or even \\"spin out\\" if there is too much force on the front tires and not enough on the rear tires. Also, when turning there is lateral torque placed upon the tires which imparts a turning force that depends upon the length of the tire distances from the CM. Thus, in a car with a short wheelbase, the short lever arm from the CM to the rear wheel will result in a greater lateral force on the rear tire which means greater acceleration and less time for the driver to adjust and prevent a spin out or worse. Wheelbases provide the basis for one of the most common vehicle size class systems. =Varying wheelbases within nameplate= Some luxury vehicles are offered with long-wheelbase variants to increase the spaciousness and therefore the luxury of the vehicle. This practice can often be found on full-size cars like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but ultra-luxury vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom and even large family cars like the Rover 75 came with 'limousine' versions. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair was given a long-wheelbase version of the Rover 75 for official use. and even some SUVs like the VW Tiguan and Jeep Wrangler come in LWB models In contrast, coup√© varieties of some vehicles such as the Honda Accord are usually built on shorter wheelbases than the sedans they are derived from. = Bikes = The wheelbase on many commercially available bicycles and motorcycles is so short, relative to the height of their centers of mass, that they are able to perform stoppies and wheelies. = Skateboards = In skateboarding the word 'wheelbase' is used for the distance between the two inner pairs of mounting holes on the deck. This is different from the distance between the rotational centers of the two wheel pairs. A reason for this alternative use is that decks are sold with prefabricated holes, but usually without trucks and wheels. It is therefore easier to use the prefabricated holes for measuring and describing this characteristic of the deck. A common misconception is that the choice of wheelbase is influenced by the height of the skateboarder. However, the length of the deck would then be a better candidate, because the wheelbase affects characteristics useful in different speeds or terrains regardless of the height of the skateboarder. For example, a deck with a long wheelbase, say , will respond slowly to turns, which is often desirable in high speeds. A deck with a short wheelbase, say , will respond quickly to turns, which is often desirable when skating backyard pools or other terrains requiring quick or intense turns.  Rail  In rail vehicles, the wheelbase follows a similar concept. However, since the wheels may be of different sizes (for example, on a steam locomotive), the measurement is taken between the points where the wheels contact the rail, and not between the centers of the wheels. On vehicles where the wheelsets (axles) are mounted inside the vehicle frame (mostly in steam locomotives), the wheelbase is the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets. On vehicles where the wheelsets are mounted on bogies (American: trucks), three wheelbase measurements can be distinguished: * the distance between the pivot points of the front-most and rear-most bogie; * the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets of the vehicle; * the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets of each bogie. The wheelbase affects the rail vehicle's capability to negotiate curves. Short-wheelbased vehicles can negotiate sharper curves. On some larger wheelbase locomotives, inner wheels may lack flanges in order to pass curves. The wheelbase also affects the load the vehicle poses to the track, track infrastructure and bridges. All other conditions being equal, a shorter wheelbase vehicle represents a more concentrated load to the track than a longer wheelbase vehicle. As railway lines are designed to take a pre- determined maximum load per unit of length (tonnes per meter, or pounds per foot), the rail vehicles' wheelbase is designed according to their intended gross weight. The higher the gross weight, the longer the wheelbase must be.

In the 1840s (circa 1846), Larcom taught at a school in Illinois before returning to Massachusetts. She went on to become one of the first teachers at Wheaton Female Seminary (now Wheaton College) in Norton, Massachusetts, and taught there from 1854 to 1862. While there, she helped to found Rushlight Literary Magazine, a submission-based student literary magazine which is still published today. From 1865 to 1873, she was the editor of the Boston-based Our Young Folks, which merged with St. Nicholas Magazine in 1874. In 1889, Larcom published one of the best-known accounts of New England childhood of her time, A New England Girlhood, commonly used as a reference in studying antebellum American childhood. This autobiographical text covers the early years of her life, in Beverly Farms and Lowell, Massachusetts. Among her earlier and best-known poems are \\"Hannah Binding Shoes,\\" and \\"The Rose Enthroned,\\" Larcom's earliest contribution to the Atlantic Monthly, when the poet Lowell was its editor, a poem, that in the absence of signature, was attributed to Emerson by one reviewer. Also of note was \\"A Loyal Woman's No\\" which was a patriotic lyric and attracted considerable attention during the American Civil War. Larcom was inclined to write on religious themes, and made two volumes of compilations from the world's great religious thinkers, Breathings of the Better Life (Boston, 1866) and Beckonings (Boston. 1886). Her last two books, As it is in Heaven (Boston, 1891) and The Unseen Friend (Boston, 1892), embodied much of her own thought on matters concerning the spiritual life. Early years and education Lucy Larcom was born in Beverly, Massachusetts in 1824 as the ninth of ten children. She was the next to the youngest of a family of eight sisters. The homes built up the streets of her village were full of neighbor children; they all played and grew up together. She read what she could find. This included the Pilgrim's Progress and the Scottish Chiefs. She read John Milton's Paradise Lost and other English literature. At the age of seven, she secretly wrote, illustrated with crude watercolors, and published (only to herself) her first work: a manuscript volume of little stories and poems. After her father's death when she was eight years old, the home at Beverly was broken up. Mrs. Larcom turned her thoughts toward Lowell. Girls were wanted, and were flocking there for employment in the mills. Homes were wanted, also, in consequence. Good, motherly housekeepers ‚Äînot common boarding-mistresses‚Äî were sought, and accepted only with the best credentials, by the corporation, to occupy its houses and take care of the operatives. Lucy's mother, the mother of many girls, was just one such. The family removed to Lowell, where her mother became a boardinghouse keeper to bring in income for the family. Here, at the age of ten, she helped her mother, in the intervals between her hours of school, in the household work. Career =Lowell mill girl= Boott Mills, ca. 1850 At age eleven, in 1835, she began working at Boott Mills, a cotton mill in Lowell, as a doffer, to earn extra money for her family. She was among the very youngest of those employed at the mills. Her first work as a Lowell operative was in a spinning-room, doffing and replacing the bobbins, after which she tended a spinning-frame and then a dressing-frame, while looking out windows towards the river. Later, she was employed in a \\"cloth- room,\\" considered to be a more agreeable working-place because of its fewer hours of confinement, its cleanliness, and the absence of machinery. The last two years of her Lowell life, which covered in all a period of about ten years, were spent in that room, not in measuring cloth, but as bookkeeper, recording the number of pieces and bales. There, she pursued her studies during leisure moments, some textbooks in mathematics, grammar, English or German literature usually laying open on her desk. Here, as in her earlier childhood, she put words to her visions through verses and by telling herself stories. Of those days, Larcom stated,‚Äî \\"While yet a child, I used to consider it special good fortune that my home was at Lowell. There was a frank friendliness and sincerity in the social atmosphere that wrought upon me unconsciously, and made the place pleasant to live in. People moved about their every-day duties with purpose and zest, and were genuinely interested in one another; while in the towns on the seaboard it sometimes was as if every man's house was his castle in almost a feudal sense, where the family shut themselves in, on the defensive against intruders.\\" Still, she never lost her love and allegiance to the seaside area where she was born, while frequent visits kept up the charm, and gave her links to her home town. The ten years that Larcom spent at the mills made a huge impact on her. The Lowell Offering, a magazine whose editors and contributors were \\"female operatives in the Lowell mills,\\" was published in 1842, and soon after Larcom became one of its corps of writers. One of her first poems was entitled \\"The River,\\" and many of her verses and essays were found in its volumes. Some of those Lowell Offering essays appeared afterwards in Similitudes, her first published work. It was at one of the meetings of the literary circle, established among the \\"mill girls\\", that Larcom first met the poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, who was then in Lowell editing a Free Soil journal. He became her friend, showing his real interest in her at once by criticising her share in the written contributions of the evening. She was then very young, but it was the beginning of an interest and gratitude that continued mutually in an established friendship. Afterward, when she had come to know and dearly love Whittier's sister, Elizabeth (\\"Lizzie\\"), the three spent time together. During happy sojourns at Salisbury Beach, near the respective homes at Amesbury and Beverly, in visits at Amesbury, in counsel and work together, out of which in recent time have grown the beautiful compilations of Child-life, and Songs of Three Centuries, their lives ran near together and contributed the one to the other. =Illinois= One after another, Larcom's sisters married out of the home, until only two remained. At about twenty years of age, Larcom accompanied the oldest of the Larcom sisters in Lowell, Emeline, to the then wild prairies of Illinois. Here, she shared in the efforts of a clergyman's household in pioneer times. A truly pioneer life was theirs as they moved many times from place to place, dependent upon who summoned the clergyman. Somewhere in this prairie Larcom taught school in a vacated log building to a neighborhood. Her students came from small colonies within this radius. It was in the corner of a big township which included three counties. She taught under the auspices of a district committee, before whom, previous to induction to office, the candidate was obliged to hold up her right hand and swear to acquaintance, sufficient to instruct from, with writing, spelling, arithmetic, and geography. Her salary was for three months; and once, when the time for payment arrived, and her brother-in-law visited the committee-man whose duty it was to make it, his reminder was met with the rather startled remark, as if the subject had never presented itself in so strong a light before:‚Äî \\"Forty dollars! Well, that's a lot o' money to pay a young woman for three months' teachin'! She oughter know consider'ble!\\" When the official was reassured by a statement of what Larcom's antecedents in study and achievement had been, he replied:‚Äî \\"Well, that's a good deal for her to ha' done!\\" before handing over the money. During another sojourning, Larcom found herself in the neighborhood of an excellent young ladies' school. Switching from teacher to scholar, she spent three years at Monticello Female Semmary, following the full course of study. During the last two years, she took charge of the preparatory department of that institution. =Back to Beverly= Eventually, Larcom tired of life in the west, so she went back to Beverly, where, for a year or two, she taught a class of young ladies before accepting a position as teacher in Wheaton Female Seminary, at Norton. She remained there for six years, conducting classes in rhetoric, English literature, and composition, while sometimes adding history, mental and moral science, or botany. Larcom's health began after these few years to suffer from such a constant strain of teaching work that she had to relinquish regular employment, although, from time to time, she lectured upon literature, or taught classes in various young ladies' schools of Boston. View from Beverly Farms Her first poem in the Atlantic was \\"The Rose Enthroned\\" and it is remembered as her greatest inspiration. It was a parable-epic of creation with twenty-one four-line stanzas. Previously to this,‚Äî as far back as during her early residence in Illinois,‚Äî some poems were published with the name, and some slight sketch of the writer, in Griswold's Female Poets of America; and at about the same time, verses of hers were printed in Sartain's Magazine. During 1852-53, she wrote frequently for the National Era, of which Mr. Whittier was corresponding editor. Later, the Independent and the Boston Congregationalist, and various other magazines received and published her contributions. \\"Hannah Binding Shoes\\" appeared first in the New York Crayon; perhaps no single poem of hers was better known or more admired. When Our Young Folks magazine was started, Larcom became one of its assistant editors. Subsequently, for a year or two, she was the leading editor. For the next seven years, she lived quietly and independently at Beverly Farms. In the spirit of ministry, she gathered together the compilation of Breathings of a Better Life. Roadside Poems, and Hillside and Seaside, were compilations from readings of nature. Childlife, Childlife in Prose, and Songs of Three Centuries, were pulled together in company with Whittier, and which he edited. The volume, Wild Roses of Cape Ann came after these. Larcom served as a model for the change in women's roles in society. She was a friend of Harriet Hanson Robinson, who worked in the Lowell mills at the same time. Robinson also became a poet and author; later, she was prominent in the women's suffrage movement. Both contributed to the literary magazine Lowell Offering. Death and legacy Headstone Larcom died at age 69 on April 17, 1893 in Boston and was buried in her hometown of Beverly, Massachusetts. Her influence is still felt in Beverly. A local literary magazine entitled The Larcom Review is named for her, as is the library at the Beverly High School. Lucy Larcom Park Larcom Mountain, located in the Ossipee Mountains in New Hampshire, is named after her, as she frequented the area during the late 1800s. At Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, the Larcom Dormitory is named after her. Rushlight Literary Magazine, which she founded, is still in publication today. Larcom's legacy is honored in Lowell, Massachusetts, where she worked as a \\"mill girl\\" at the Boott Mills, and as such, the Lucy Larcom Park was named after her to honor her works of literature that recounted her life at the mills. The park is located between the two Lowell High School buildings, and excerpts from her writings can be found on monuments, statues and other works of art throughout the park. Style and themes Larcom's later writings, assumed a deeply religious tone, in which the faith of her whole life found complete expression. In retrospection, she wrote Idyl of Work. Notwithstanding the fact that she really meant to set forth the image she had in her mind of her own elder sister, she unconsciously gave herself also, perhaps, through family likeness, in some touches of her portrayal of \\"Esther\\" in the Idyl. In her Idyl of Work and also in A New England Girlhood, Larcom described her early life. In the Idyl, the mill-life of forty or fifty years earlier was portrayed.

In December 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution supporting the creation of an international certification scheme for rough diamonds. By November 2002, negotiations between governments, the international diamond industry and civil society organisations resulted in the creation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS).

The KPCS is credited as being instrumental toward dramatically reducing ‚Äúconflict diamonds‚Äù to less than 1% of the world‚Äôs diamond production today. The World Diamond Council has representation on all the Kimberley Process's working groups and is influential in determining its implementation and future reform. The Council was set up in July 2000 in Antwerp, Belgium after a joint meeting of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB), representing all the world's significant diamond trading centres, and the International Diamond Manufacturers Association (IDMA), representing significant manufacturers.

Early years Born in Catton, near Norwich, England, John Lindley was one of four children of George and Mary Lindley. George Lindley was a nurseryman and pomologist and ran a commercial nursery garden. Although he had great horticultural knowledge, the undertaking was not profitable and George lived in a state of indebtedness. As a boy he would assist in the garden and also collected wild flowers he found growing in the Norfolk countryside. Lindley was educated at Norwich School. He would have liked to go to university or to buy a commission in the army but the family could not afford either.Stearn, 17‚Äì18 He became Belgian agent for a London seed merchant in 1815. At this time Lindley became acquainted with the botanist William Jackson Hooker who allowed him to use his botanical library and who introduced him to Sir Joseph Banks who offered him employment as an assistant in his herbarium.Stearn, 19 His first publication, in 1819, a translation of the Analyse du fruit of L. C. M. Richard, was followed in 1820 by an original Monographia Rosarum, with descriptions of new species, and drawings executed by himself, then in 1821 by Monographia Digitalium, and \\"Observations on Pomaceae\\", which were both contributed to the Linnean Society. Career left Lindley went to work at Banks‚Äô house in London. He concentrated on the genera ‚ÄúRosa‚Äù and ‚ÄúDigitalis‚Äù and published the monograph ‚ÄúA Botanical History of Roses‚Äù which distinguished seventy-six species, describes thirteen new ones and was illustrated by nineteen coloured plates painted by himself. He became acquainted with Joseph Sabine who grew a large assortment of roses and was the Secretary of the Horticultural Society of London. His employment came to an abrupt end with the death of Banks a few months later. One of Banks‚Äô friends, a wealthy merchant called William Cattley, paid Lindley to draw and describe new plants in his garden at Barnet. He also paid for the publication of ‚ÄúDigitalia Monographia‚Äù. (Later Lindley honoured him by naming the orchid genus Cattleya after him.) In 1820, at the age of twenty-one, Lindley was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London.Stearn, 20 From 1821 to 1826 he published a folio work with coloured illustrations that he had painted himself, ‚ÄúCollectanea botanica or Figures and botanic Illustrations of rare and curious exotic Plants‚Äù. Many of these plants came from the family Orchidaceae with which he had a lifelong fascination.Stearn, 30 Lindley was appointed assistant secretary to the Royal Horticultural Society and its new garden at Chiswick in 1822, where he supervised the collection of plants.Aitken, R., ‚ÄòLindley, John‚Äô, in R. Aitken and M. Looker (eds) (2002) Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, South Melbourne, Oxford University Press. . p. 371. Assistant secretary to the Horticultural Society since 1822, in 1829 Lindley was appointed to the chair of botany at University College, London, which he retained until 1860. He also lectured on botany from 1831 at the Royal Institution, including delivering the 1833 Royal Institution Christmas Lecture, and from 1836 at the Chelsea Physic Garden, starting the society's flower show in the late 1830s.Portrait from the Makers of British botany (1913)Lindley described the plants collected on Thomas Livingstone Mitchell's expeditions of 1838 and wrote an Appendix to Edwards's Botanical Register of 1839, describing plants collected by James Drummond and Georgiana Molloy of the Swan River Colony in Western Australia. According to John Ryan, Lindley's 1840 ‚ÄòSketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony‚Äô provided ‚Äòthe most succinct portrait to date of the flora of the Swan River Settlement‚Äô, which had been established in 1829. The Sketch, which was published during November 1839 and January 1840 in Edwards‚Äô Botanical Register and separately on its completion, was illustrated by nine hand- coloured lithographs and four wood-cuts. He also played a large part in having Charles Moore appointed as Director of the Sydney Botanical Gardens. During his professorship, he wrote many scientific and popular works as well as making significant contributions to the Botanical Register, of which he was the editor for many years, and to The Gardeners' Chronicle, where he was in charge of the horticultural department from 1841. He was a fellow of the Royal, Linnean and Geological Societies. He received the Royal Society's royal medal in 1857, and in 1853 became a corresponding member of the Institut de France. =Horticultural Society of London= About this time, the Horticultural Society of London, which became the Royal Horticultural Society at a later date, asked Lindley to draw roses and in 1822 he became the Assistant Secretary of the Society's garden. The Society's historian, Harold R Fletcher, later described him as ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ the backbone of the Society and possibly the greatest servant it had ever had.‚Äù Now with a steady income, in 1823 he married Sarah Freestone (1797‚Äì1869). They rented a house in rural Acton Green, a location convenient for the Society's garden at Turnham Green.Stearn, 28 The Secretary of the Horticultural Society of London at that time was Joseph Sabine and he authorised expenditure on large projects beyond the Society's means. Lindley could only expostulate and was unsuccessful in moderating his actions. By 1830, the Society had mounting debts and a committee of enquiry was set up. Sabine resigned as Secretary and Lindley successfully defended his own position and carried the Society forward with the new Honorary Secretary, George Bentham.Fletcher, H. R. (1969) The Story of the Royal Horticultural Society, 1804‚Äì1868. Oxford University Press, London. Middle years An eminent botanist of the time, John Claudius Loudon, sought Lindley's collaboration on his ‚ÄúEncyclopedia of Plants‚Äù. This covered nearly fifteen thousand species of flowering plants and ferns. It was a massive undertaking and Lindley was responsible for most of it.Stearn, 31 During his labour on this undertaking, which was completed in 1829, and through arduous study of character patterns, he became convinced of the superiority of the \\"natural\\" classification system devised by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu ‚Äì a system that he believed reflected the great plan of nature as distinct from the \\"artificial\\" system of Linnaeus followed in the Encyclopaedia of Plants. This conviction found expression in A Synopsis of British Flora, arranged according to the Natural Order (1829) and in An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany (1830). In 1828 Lindley was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London and in 1833 was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Munich. Other honours came from France, the United States and Switzerland.Stearn, 37 In 1829 Lindley sought to augment his income and became professor of botany at the newly established London University while still continuing his post at the Royal Horticultural Society. He had not been to university himself but apparently was an excellent teacher, giving six hour- long lectures each week. Being dissatisfied with what was available, he wrote some botanical textbooks for his students.Stearn, 32‚Äì34 After the death of Joseph Banks and the death also of their patron, King George III, the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew went into a decline. The Government commissioned a report on their future to be prepared by Lindley, Joseph Paxton and John Wilson, head gardener to the Earl of Surrey. The report recommended that the Gardens be retained but the Government did not accept their findings and proposed to abolish it, distribute the plants and pull down the glasshouses. On 11 February 1840, Lindley told the Prime Minister that the matter was to be raised in Parliament. This caused an outcry. The public was indignant, the Government backed down and the Gardens were saved. William Hooker was appointed to be the new Director.Desmond, R. (1995) Kew, The History of the Royal Botanic Gardens. Havill Press, London. . In 1845, Lindley was part of a scientific commission set up by the Government to investigate potato blight and the Irish famine. The cause of the fungal disease was not known at the time and the weather was thought to be to blame. Although the commission was powerless to solve the problem, their report brought about the repeal of the 1815 Corn Laws which had forbidden the import of cheap wheat from America. This helped to alleviate the effects of the disease on populations that had become reliant on the monoculture of potatoes.Stearn, 54‚Äì55 He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1859. Lindley was very industrious and hardworking and published a number of works including ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants‚Äô‚Äô, the writing of which occupied him for ten years. He was acknowledged to be the top authority on the classification of orchids of his time. Bentham and Hooker, writing in 1883, accepted 114 genera he had named and described, and Pfitzer, in 1889, accepted 127. Over many years, Lindley had described a large number of orchid species, and many other plants, naming them and giving each a concise description of the plant‚Äôs characteristics.Stearn, 64‚Äì65 He was held in high regard by other botanists and was honoured by naming more than 200 species with the epithets \\"lindleyi\\", \\"lindleyana\\", \\"lindleyanum\\", \\"lindleyanus\\", \\"lindleya\\" and \\"lindleyoides\\".Stearn, 67 Later years In 1861, Lindley took charge of organising the exhibits from the British colonies for the International Exhibition at South Kensington. This was exhausting work and seems to have taken a toll on his health. His memory also began deteriorating. He resigned his university professorship that year and his position as Secretary to the Royal Horticultural Society two years later. In 1863 he travelled to Vichy, a spa in the center of France, but his health continued to decline. He died at his home at Acton Green, near London, aged 66. He was survived by his wife, two daughters including Sarah Lindley Crease and a son. The daughters were accomplished artists themselves and the son, Nathaniel, became a distinguished lawyer, the Master of the Rolls and a life peer.Stearn, 68  List of selected publications  *Translation of Analyse du fruit by L.

Lava Beds) was a battle during the Modoc War between a band of the Native American Modoc tribe and the Army of the United States, in northeastern California. The battle began on April 15, 1873, and ended on April 17, 1873. The Army succeeded in forcing the Modoc to abandon their fortified position at Captain Jack's Stronghold in the Lava Beds, but failed to capture the band. Background Following the assassination of Major General Edward Canby and another member of a peace delegation during a peace conference on April 11, 1873, the Army, under the command of Colonel Alvan Gillem, made preparations to attack the Stronghold. Fighting On April 15 a general attack began, troops advancing from Gillem's camp on the west and Mason's camp at Hospital Rock, northeast of the Stronghold. Fighting continued throughout the day, the troops remaining in position during the night. Each advance of troops on the 16th was under heavy fire from the Modoc positions. That night the troops succeeded in cutting the Modoc off from their water supply at the shore of Tule Lake.NPS:Lava Beds National Monument By the morning of April 17 everything was in readiness for the final attack on the Stronghold. When the order was given to advance, the troops charged into the Stronghold. After the fighting along the shoreline of Tule Lake on the afternoon and night of April 16, the Modocs defending the Stronghold realized that their water supply had been cut off by the troops commanding the shoreline. On April 17, before the troops had received the order to charge the Stronghold, the Modoc escaped through a crevice left unguarded during a movement of troops from one position to another. Casualties During the fighting at the Stronghold, April 15‚Äì17, casualties included one officer and six enlisted men killed, and thirteen enlisted men wounded. The only Modoc casualty was a boy, reported to have been killed when a cannonball, which he was attempting to open with an axe, exploded. Several Modoc women were reported to have died from sickness.

However, Largilli√®re left at the age of eighteen and went to England, where he was befriended and employed by Peter Lely for four years at Windsor, Berkshire. =Painting career= Early career National Museum, Warsaw His painting caught the attention of Charles II, who wished to retain Largilli√®re in his service, but the controversy aroused by the Rye House Plot against Roman Catholics alarmed Largilli√®re. Largilli√®re left for Paris, where he was well received by the public as a painter. Upon ascending to the throne in 1685, James II requested Largilli√®re to return to England. James II offered Largilli√®re the office of keeper of the royal collections, but he declined due to being uneasy about Rye House Plot. However, during a short stay in London, he painted portraits of the king, the queen Mary of Modena, and the prince of Wales James Francis Edward Stuart. The portrait of the Prince of Wales could not have been painted during Largilli√®re's stay in London because the prince was not born until 1688. The three portraits painted by Largilli√®re of the prince in his youth must have been executed in Paris, where he returned sometime before March 1686. The portrait of King James II was painted in 1686. King James is portrayed in golden armor with a white cravat and is positioned in front of a watercolour-like background set in a round frame. French Academy In Paris, during the year 1686, Largilli√®re produced a portrait of the painter Charles Le Brun for admittance to the French Academy. The portrait shows Le Brun, then the chairman of the academy, at work on an entombment, surrounded by classical busts and figurines scattered upon the floor and table within the picture. Le Brun, impressed by Largilli√®re's portrait, accepted him to the academy. In 1690, Largilli√®re was documented by the French Academy as a historical painter, which was a prominent artistic trend of the academy until the introduction of √âdouard Manet. In 1693, Largilli√®re painted the Governor of Arras, Pierre de Montesquiou, to celebrate his promotion to brigadier in 1691. In 1694, Largilli√®re's made a multi-figure work that is displayed in the church of Saint-√âtienne-du-Mont. In 1709, Largilli√®re painted the royal family portrait of The Family of Louis XIV. This portrait shows King Louis XIV, Madame de Ventadour (governess of the children of the Duke of Burgundy), the 3-year old Louis, Duke of Brittany (1707‚Äì1712), Louis, Grand Dauphin and Louis, Duke of Burgundy, future dauphin. The King displays a sense of slight uneasiness unlike the other figures especially. In the painting, Largilli√®re used the Renaissance technique of structured disposition. A year later, Largilli√®re painted a self-portrait which also contained two female members of his family. Later career Self-portrait of Nicolas de Largillierre. Engraving by Fran√ßois Chereau (1715). Study of hands (Mus√©e du Louvre) Towards the end of his life, Largilli√®re painted a repetition of anonymous male portraits of Parisian nobles. One example was painted in 1710, of a man standing with spread fingers that conceal a letter held in the other hand. Another portrait from about 1715 shows a frontal three quarter view of a man dressed in similar clothes and wig with a Doric column in the background. In 1714, Largilli√®re painted King Augustus II of Poland. Largilli√®re also painted the artist Jacques-Antoine Arlaud in a red robe in a similar fashion to Largilli√®re's portrait of the painter Charles Le Brun, as well as the sculptor Nicolas Couston. Around the next year, Largilli√®re painted The Study of Different Types of Hands, which currently resides in the Louvre. In 1718, Largilli√®re painted the French poet and essayist Voltaire. The Entry of Christ into Jerusalem was a landscape painting that Largilli√®re painted in 1720. Largilli√®re made his last self-portrait in 1725. This portrait displays the artist at his easel staring toward the audience. Largilli√®re was appointed as chancellor of the French Academy in 1743. =Death= Nicolas de Largilli√®re died on 20 March 1746 at the age of 89. Upon his death, he donated to France several small landscapes and still life pictures he had created. =Legacy= The Ashmolean Museum (University of Oxford), the Fitzwilliam Museum (University of Cambridge), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Louvre, the National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.), the Nelson- Atkins Museum of Art (Kansas City, Missouri), the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg and Pinacoteca di Brera (Milan), Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (Lisbon), Museum de Fundatie (Zwolle), the Detroit Institute of Arts (Detroit) and the Speed Art Museum (Louisville) are among the public collections holding works by Nicolas de Largilli√®re. Jean-Baptiste Oudry and Jacob van Schuppen, Largilli√®re's pupil and nephew respectively, were also rococo painters.

The S-76 features twin turboshaft engines, four-bladed main and tail rotors, and retractable landing gear. Development The development of the S-76 began in the mid-1970s as the S-74, with the design goal of providing a medium helicopter for corporate transportation and the oil drilling industry; the S-74 was later redesignated the S-76 in honor of the U.S. Bicentennial. Sikorsky's design work on the S-70 helicopter (which was selected for use by the United States Army as the UH-60 Black Hawk) was utilized in the development of the S-76, incorporating S-70 design technology in its rotor blades and rotor heads.Lambert Flight International, 6 May 1978, p. 1378. It was the first Sikorsky helicopter designed purely for commercial rather than military use.Lambert Flight International 6 May 1978, p. 1377. The prototype first flew on March 13, 1977. Initial US Federal Aviation Administration type certification was granted on November 21, 1978, with the first customer delivery on February 27, 1979.Air International March 1980, pp. 142, 144. The S-76 was named \\"Spirit\\" late in 1978,Air International March 1980, p. 144. but this name was officially dropped by the company on October 9, 1980, due to translation issues into some foreign languages.Kline, R.E., \\"Identification of S-76 Helicopter\\", Sikorsky Internal Correspondence P-2462, October 9, 1980.

Several airlines operate the S-76A on scheduled services including Helijet Airways of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The S-76 Mk II was introduced in 1982 and the S-76B in 1987, with its top speed of at sea level. Over 500 S-76s had been delivered by early 2001. The S-76C+ was produced until December 2005. It is equipped with twin Turbomeca Arriel 2S1 engines with FADEC and a Honeywell EFIS suite. This version incorporates active noise suppression, vibration dampers and a composite main rotor. On January 3, 2006, the S-76 C++ replaced earlier versions in production. It is powered by two Turbomeca Arriel 2S2 engines and incorporates an improved and quieter transmission as well as minor changes in the interior equipment and avionics. There were 92 orders for this model as of January 2006. Development of the follow-on S-76D was subject to four years of delays due to technical problems in expanding the flight envelope. The prototype made its first flight on February 7, 2009, and type certification was initially expected in 2011, with deliveries forecast for the end of that year. It was FAA certified on 12 October 2012. Three prototypes were used in the certification program, with one aircraft used to certify the optional rotor electric ice-protection system. The \\"D\\" model is powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210S engines driving composite rotors and incorporates active vibration control. Performance is substantially improved with the added power, but initial certification retains the same gross weight and maximum cruise speed as earlier models.\\"First Flight for Improved Sikorsky S-76\\", p. 15. Aviation Week & Space Technology, February 16, 2009. Changhe Aircraft Industries Corporation was contracted in September 2013 to produce the S-76D airframe. Design S-76A++ used for Search and Rescue at Royal Australian Air Force bases operated by CHC Helicopter The S-76 is of conventional configuration, with a four-bladed fully articulated main rotor and a four-bladed anti-torque rotor on the port side of the tailboom. Two turboshaft engines are located above the passenger cabin.Taylor 1982, pp. 476‚Äì477. In the prototypes and initial production aircraft, these engines were Allison 250-C30s, a new version of the popular Allison 250 engine developed specially for the S-76, with a single-stage centrifugal compressor instead of the multi-stage axial/centrifugal compressor of earlier models of the engine, rated at for takeoff.Air International March 1980, pp. 113‚Äì114. These engines are connected to the main rotor by the main gearbox, a three-stage unit with a bull gear as its final stage rather than the planetary gear used by previous generations of Sikorsky helicopters. This arrangement has 30% fewer parts and lower costs than a more conventional design.Air International March 1980, p. 114. The main rotor hub has a single piece aluminum hub with elastomeric bearings designed not to require lubrication or any other kind of maintenance throughout its design life. The main rotor blades have titanium spars and incorporate a ten degree twist to give an even loading when hovering, while they use a non-symmetrical airfoil section with a drooped leading edge. The rotor tips are tapered and swept back. Flight controls are servo-assisted, with a Stability Augmentation System fitted.Air International March 1980, pp. 114, 116. A retractable nosewheel undercarriage is fitted, which gives the S-76A a increase in cruising speed; emergency flotation gear can be fitted using helium-filled bags to increase buoyancy in the event of a forced landing on water. The fuselage of the aircraft is of mixed metal and composites construction; the nose is composed of fiberglass while the cabin primarily employs a light alloy honeycomb structure, the semi-monocoque tailboom is also constructed of light alloy. Two pilots (or a pilot and a passenger) sit side by side in the cockpit, situated ahead of the cabin, which can accommodate a further 12 passengers in three rows of four, or four to eight passengers in more luxurious executive seating.

Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 1997. . ;Sikorsky S-76 SHADOW: Boeing-Sikorsky MANPRINT study. The original concept of the LHX program was to produce a one- man helicopter that could do more than a two-man aircraft. The Sikorsky (S-76) Helicopter Advance Demonstrator of Operators Workload (SHADOW) had a single- pilot advanced cockpit grafted to its nose. The purpose was to study the MANPRINT or human engineering interface between the pilot and the cockpit controls and displays. The cockpit was the prototype of a single-pilot cockpit designed for use on the prototype RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter. The cockpit was designed so sensors would feed data to the pilot through helmet-mounted displays. The MANPRINT study determined that single- pilot operation of the Comanche was unsafe, and would result in pilot overload. As result of this study, the Comanche was designed to be operated by a crew of two.

Life Martius was born at Erlangen, the son of Prof Ernst Wilhelm Martius, court apothecary. He graduated Ph.D. from Erlangen University in 1814, publishing as his thesis a critical catalogue of plants in the university's botanical garden. After that he continued to devote himself to botanical study, and in 1817 he and Johann Baptist von Spix were sent to Brazil by Maximilian I Joseph, the king of Bavaria. They travelled from Rio de Janeiro through several of the southern and eastern provinces of Brazil and travelled up the Amazon River to Tabatinga, as well as exploring some of its larger tributaries. On his return to Europe in 1820 Martius was appointed as the keeper of the botanic garden at Munich, including the herbarium at the Munich Botanical Collection, and in 1826 as professor of botany in the university there, and he held both offices until 1864. He devoted his chief attention to the flora of Brazil, and in addition to numerous short papers he published the Nova Genera et Species Plantarum Brasiliensium (1823‚Äì1832, 3 vols.) and Icones selectae Plantarum Cryptogamicarum Brasiliensium (1827), both works being finely illustrated. An account of his travels in Brazil appeared in three volumes between 1823 and 1831, with an atlas of plates, but probably the work by which he is best known is his Historia naturalis palmarum (1823‚Äì1850) in three large folio volumes, in which all known genera of the palm family are described and illustrated. The work contains more than 240 chromolithographs, with habitat sketches and botanical dissections.Plants and Gardens Portrayed: Rare and Illustrated Books from The LuEsther T In 1840 he began the Flora Brasiliensis, with the assistance of the most distinguished European botanists, who undertook monographs of the various orders. Its publication was continued after his death under the editorship of A. W. Eichler (1839‚Äì1887) until 1887, and subsequently of Ignatz Urban. He also edited several works on the zoological collections made in Brazil by Spix, after the death of the latter in 1826. In 1837, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. On the outbreak of potato disease in Europe he investigated it and published his observations in 1842. He also published works and short papers on the aborigines of Brazil, on their civil and social condition, on their past and probable future, on their diseases and medicines, and on the languages of the various tribes, especially the Tupi. He died at Munich; his gravestone is decorated with two palm fronds and the Latin inscription In palmis semper virens resurgo. A species of South American snake, Hydrops martii, is named in his honor.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Martius\\", p. 170). The Martiusstra√üe in Munich is named after him. He married (1801‚Äì1843). His son was German chemist, entrepreneur and company founder Carl Alexander von Martius (1838‚Äì1920) Herbarium Martii Memorial plaque for Martius in Munich, erected 1968 by the State of Brazil. As well as a huge collection of flora specimens owned by Martius prior to his departure to South America, he returned with another 12,000 specimens which together formed the Herbarium Martii. At the time of his death the collection had been further expanded and comprised 300,000 specimens representing 65,000 species from around the world, and was one of the largest private herbaria assembled. The Belgian government acquired the collection in 1870 which formed the basis of the then newly established Jardin botanique de l'Etat. The collection is now held as part of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium. The Martius Project is an effort by the Botanic Garden to digitize the entire collection.Martius Project Route followed in Brazil during 1817‚Äì1820 expedition Travels in Brazil, in the years 1817‚Äì1820 Martius and Spix, accompanied by Johann Christian Mikan who was with his wife and the artist Thomas Ender travelled to Brazil with the Austrian Commission, which joined the wedding train of Archduchess Leopoldina of Austria and Dom Pedro de Alcantara, the future Emperor of Brazil. The party left from Trieste on 10 April 1817. The first natural history collections were made in the city of Rio de Janeiro at Laranjeiras, Corcovado, Aqueduto, Fonte da Carioca, Tijuca, Botafogo, Jardim Botanico) immediately following the wedding. Spix and Martius then spent some days at \\"Fazenda Mandioca\\" with Grigori Ivanovitch Langsdorff and then went to a fazenda near Rio Paraiba before returning to Rio. A mounted expedition took them on horseback to Itagua√≠ (13 December 1817) through S√£o Paulo state to the city of S√£o Paulo where they arrived on 31 December 1817. They left on 9 January 1818 for Sorocaba and Itu on to Minas Gerais, then through Camanducaia to cross the Rio Sapuca√≠ for S√£o Gon√ßalo and Ouro Pr√™to. On 1 May 1818, they left for Diamantina, Minas Novas and then Montes Claros. Route followed by Martius and Spix between 1817 and 1820 On 12 August 1818, they headed North-North East to Rio Carinhanha, as far as the Serra Geral then returned by Cod√≥ to Carinhanha arriving at Rio de Contas on 17 October 1818, then riding east to cross the Rio Paragua√ßu arriving at Salvador on 10 November 1818, and leaving on 18 February 1819 via Coit and Jacobina. The party then travelled to Piaui, Oeiras where they arrived on 3 May. They departed on 11 May, arriving on 15 May at S√£o Gon√ßalo do Amarante, where Martius became seriously ill. Spix had at this time contracted the schistosomiasis from which he eventually died. On 3 June 1819, they arrived in Maranh√£o to replenish funds and supplies. They then sailed down the Rio Itapicuru to S√£o Luis from where they left on 20 July for Bel√©m, arriving there on 25 July, having collected specimens at several places in between. They left Bel√©m on 21 August for an Amazon voyage, up the Tocantins to Breves, arriving in Gurup√° on 9 September and Porto de Moz on the Rio Xingu on 10 September. They spent 19 September through 30th in Santar√©m, arriving at Barra do Rio Negro on 22 October and leaving on 2 November. They reached Tef√©, then called Ega, on 26 November, then split up. Spix left Tef√© on 7 December 1819, for Solim√µes and visiting Tabatinga before returning to Manaus on 3 February 1820. He then travelled up the Rio Negro to Moura, Barcelos returning to Manaus on 26 February. Martius left Tef√© on 12 December, ascended Rio Japur√°, returning to Manaus on 11 March, where they reunited. They departed for Bel√©m arriving on 16 April 1820, and left for Europe on 13 June 1820. After this journey, Martius and Spix published their account of their travels and work in Brazil. In the appendix, they published a piece of dance music, a lundu, the earliest example of this form of music recorded, it is now known as Lundu: Recolhido por C.P.F. von Martius.

She was born in Twin City, Georgia during the 1930s, first sang in glee clubs, and studied opera. She began performing country music in the early 1950s. Her first single was on the Triple A label, following her discovery by deejay Jack Gale. Wright next signed with the new Fabor label on the West Coast, recording a duet with Jim Reeves, \\"I Love You\\" (Fabor 101), which spent 22 weeks on Billboard's country charts in early 1954, peaking at No. 3. One year later she returned to the hit parade with another duet, \\"Are You Mine\\" (Fabor 117), this time with Tom Tall, which did even better. Over a 26-week run on Billboard's country charts, it peaked at No. 2. It was her second top 10 duet and her final chart appearance. After taking a break from her career in the mid-1950s to raise a family, Wright entered country music in the 1960s, cutting a few singles for the Chart label. Wright recorded more duets, including additional ones with Tom Tall, who followed her to the Chart label. Her sound began to change in the 1960s, acquiring more of a Nashville flavor. A series of one-off label recordings followed, including a couple for Jack Gale's Gallery 11 label, one for Travel and a couple for Cayce. Wright also cut an album for Playback Records featuring gospel standards with organ accompaniment. At this time Wright's popularity began to rise in the German market. Her first German success was the album Ginny Wright's Songs & Duets.

History Founded in 1966, the UC Davis School of Medicine graduated its first class of physicians in 1972. The school maintains research facilities on the Davis campus while the majority of the school's teaching and clinical space is located in Sacramento, 17 miles to the east of the Davis campus. With the December 2006 opening of its new Education Building, the school recently transitioned all medical school classes to the Sacramento campus. Research activities will continue in the same capacity at both campuses for the foreseeable future. The school gained national attention when an applicant challenged the school's affirmative action admissions policy. The Supreme Court of the United States, in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), ruled that the applicant had unconstitutionally been denied admission, and Bakke was admitted. Admissions and ranking UC Davis Medical Center Admissions is highly competitive. In 2011, the school received 4,792 applications, offered interviews to 460 applicants of which 100 matriculated. The acceptance rate for applicants to UC Davis School of Medicine is approximately 1.8%. For 2019, US News and World Report ranks UC Davis School of Medicine #9 based on primary care methodology and #30 based on research methodology. Hospitals UC Davis Medical Center, located in Sacramento, is one of five teaching hospitals in the University of California system. It ranks among the top 50 hospitals in America, according to an annual survey published by U.S. News and World Report.

The southern terminus of the route is at the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NY 17) in the town of Avoca. Its northern terminus is at I-490 (the Western Expressway) in Rochester. North of I-490, the expressway continues as NY 390 to the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Greece. I-390 connects to its parent, I-90 (the New York State Thruway), in Henrietta, a southern suburb of Rochester. The route is known as the Genesee Expressway from Avoca to I-590 in Brighton, where it becomes part of the Rochester Outer Loop. In addition to servicing Rochester, I-390 serves as an important connecting route between the Rochester metropolitan area and Corning and the rest of the Southern Tier of New York. The freeway also serves several smaller communities between Corning and Rochester, including the Livingston County villages of Dansville and Geneseo. I-390 effectively replaced U.S. Route 15 (US 15) and parallels NY 15, US 15's de facto successor north of Corning. From Lakeville north to Brighton, the two routes cross paths four times and are located no more than apart along the entire stretch. The first section of the Genesee Expressway opened in the late 1960s, extending from Wayland in the east to Dansville in the west. The entirety of the then-proposed highway was designated as New York State Route 401 in 1970 but redesignated as I-390 . More sections of the freeway opened throughout the 1970s, and I-390 was extended northwestward to cover the southwestern quadrant of the Rochester Outer Loop in 1980 following the elimination of NY 47\\\\. I-390 was completed in the early 1980s. Route description In its southern sections, which account for most of the highway's mileage, I-390 is a lightly trafficked freeway of two lanes in either direction going through minimally populated rural areas. Closer to Rochester, it becomes wider to accommodate the increased traffic it handles in the city itself. =Steuben and Livingston counties= I-390 begins as westbound traffic on the concurrent routes of I-86 and NY 17 proceeds below the overpass carrying those two routes to the west, at an interchange just east of the village of Avoca in Steuben County. The expressway heads northwest through the narrow valley of the Cohocton River to Cohocton, where the river leaves the expressway and heads north toward the hamlet of Atlanta. I-390 climbs gradually as it continues past Cohocton, eventually turning due west as it descends to an interchange with NY 21 south of Wayland. This exit is also the southern terminus of NY 15, which eventually parallels the interstate further north. alt=A divided expressway curving through a rural landscape alongside a valley, climbing slightly in the background. The road climbs again as it makes a gentle bend and widens as it crosses the Livingston County line just south of Dansville and north of Stony Brook State Park. Descending again, it returns to its northwestern heading. North of the village it climbs to the west side of the wide valley of Canaseraga Creek, giving the roadway a view over the area known locally as the Flats. NY 36 begins to parallel the highway closely, with NY 63 on the far side of the Flats. Just south of the hamlet of Sonyea, NY 36 crosses at a diamond interchange. I-390 turns northeast briefly but resumes its northwest course soon afterward. At this point, the highway follows more level ground, with woods and swamps mostly replacing farmland in the surrounding landscape. alt=A divided expressway curves from the right of the image through a mostly wooded landscape towards a ridgeline at the rear below a blue sky filled with little white fluffy clouds. Along the roadway closest to the camera is a large white truck with \\"Perry's Ice Cream\\" along the side and pictures of scoops of ice cream in various colors and flavors After passing rest areas on either side, I-390 reaches the NY 408 exit adjacent to the American Rock Salt mine at Hampton Corners. Here, most traffic bound for the Buffalo area exits to go west to Mount Morris, visible across the flats from the freeway, where it follows NY 36 north. To the immediate east of the exit Route 408 ends at Route 63, which carries traffic from the interstate into Geneseo, the county seat. A mile north of the exit, Canaseraga Creek drains into the Genesee River on the road's west side. The expressway continues north through Livingston County to Geneseo, which I-390 skirts to the south and east. While there is no exit for Geneseo on the part of the freeway that encroaches the village, exit 8, an interchange with US 20A east of Geneseo, provides the connection. Also accessible from the junction is the hamlet of Lakeville, situated off to the east at the junction of US 20A and NY 15\\\\. I-390 continues on, encountering NY 15 north of Lakeville and southeast of Avon. From here north to Rochester, I-390 and NY 15 follow closely parallel alignments. Both highways meet US 20 and NY 5 east of Avon prior to crossing into Monroe County. =Monroe County= As I-390 heads north through the southern extents of the county, the surroundings become more residential and commercial in nature. The freeway meets NY 15 and NY 251 in Rush ahead of an interchange with both the New York State Thruway (I-90) and NY 253 in southern Henrietta. Past the Thruway, the transition from the rural landscapes of the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes to residential and commercial areas is completed as I-390 continues into the suburbs of Rochester and the commercial center of Henrietta. Roughly from NY 253, I-390 has an exit leading to Hylan Drive, a through street leading to The Marketplace Mall. Farther north, I-390 meets both NY 15A and NY 252 in equally commercialized areas before entering Brighton. Northbound on I-390 in southern Henrietta. The skyline of downtown Rochester is visible in the background. Shortly after entering Brighton, I-390 crosses over the Erie Canal and meets the southern terminus of I-590 at a large semi-directional T interchange located adjacent to the canal and South Clinton Avenue. The latter of the two passes through the eastern half of the junction, crossing over I-590 but passing under the ramps connecting I-590 south to I-390 south and I-390 north to I-590 north. Past the exit, I-390 turns to the west, joining the Rochester Outer Loop and crossing back over the canal ahead of an interchange with NY 15 and NY 15A. After passing under NY 15, the freeway begins to run along the southern edge of the Erie Canal, here delimiting the southern city limits of Rochester. The canal and I-390 run side-by-side for just over to the Genesee River, where I-390 veers slightly to the west as it meets NY 383 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. I-390 southbound by the Rochester Airport, with heavy traffic on the northbound side For the next mile (1.6 km), I-390 follows a more northwesterly alignment along the northeastern edge of the Greater Rochester International Airport grounds. It meets Brooks Avenue (NY 204) at the northern edge of the grounds before leaving the airport area and curving more to the north, matching changes in the Erie Canal's alignment as both entities proceed around the southwestern edge of the city. Now in Gates, I-390 crosses over the Rochester and Southern Railroad just south of another partial cloverleaf interchange with NY 33A. The freeway continues on, passing under the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision and NY 33 before connecting to I-490 at a complex interchange roughly west of the canal and the city limits. I-390 ends here; however, the freeway continues northward toward Greece as NY 390. History Construction on a limited-access highway between Wayland and Dansville began .National Bridge Inventory, a database compiled by the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, available at www.nationalbridges.com. Accessed August 13, 2007. The highway opened to traffic as a realignment of NY 245. On January 1, 1970, the expressway became part of NY 401, a designation that also extended south to the town of Avoca and north to the city of Rochester along the Genesee Expressway, a proposed freeway utilizing the US 15 corridor. NY 401 was added to the Interstate Highway System and redesignated I-390 . As initially planned, I-390 would continue north into downtown Rochester and end at I-490 while the entirety of the Rochester Outer Loop south of I-490 would become I-590. I-390 northbound near its interchange with I-590 Construction began on the portion of I-390 between NY 17 near the village of Avoca and NY 21 south of Wayland. It opened to traffic . By 1977, work had begun on the leg between NY 251 in Rush and the New York State Thruway (I-90) in Henrietta. This section was completed by 1981, as were the Dansville‚ÄìGroveland (NY 36), Avon‚ÄìRush, and Thruway ‚Äì Hylan Drive segments. The remainder of I-390 in Monroe County up to the modern I-390 / I-590 interchange was built , and the final gap in the expressway from NY 36 to US 20 in Livingston County opened . By the late 1970s, the proposed extension of I-390 into downtown Rochester was scrapped. Instead, the state of New York began to look into the possibility of changing the designations that were assigned to the Outer Loop. In one proposal submitted to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in the late 1970s, I-590 would be truncated to begin at the then-proposed junction with I-390 in Brighton. The rest of the loop south of I-490, meanwhile, would become part of an extended I-390, which would continue north past I-490 to the Outer Loop's northwestern end at the Lake Ontario State Parkway. NY 47, the then-current designation for much of the Outer Loop, would be eliminated entirely. Most of the plans went into effect when the NY 47 designation was eliminated on March 18, 1980. The southern half of the Outer Loop was signed as planned; however, I-390 and I-590 were modified to end at their junctions with I-490. While NY 47 was officially assigned to the entirety of the Outer Loop prior to its removal, only the portion from NY 383 north to I-490 was actually once part of NY 47. On February 10, 2008, whiteout conditions caused a 36-car pileup near the Scottsville Road exit, which led to a 17-year-old girl's death. Firefighters had to climb over cars and cut off roofs to get to people. More than 20 people were taken to the hospital. On July 17, 2011, a tour bus heading northbound from Washington, D.C. to Niagara Falls crashed between the Avoca and Cohocton exits, killing two and injuring at least 35 others. Preliminary investigation listed a blown-out tire as a possible cause of the crash. Future As the successor to US 15 in Western New York, it has been suggested that I-390 be added to the routes of either I-99 or I-83 as recently as 2002, with I-99's northern completed segment currently sharing the US 15 routing up to Corning, New York, 24 miles south of I-390's current southern terminus. However, no official moves have been forwarded to fulfill this.

Sheet music cover for \\"I'm Just Wild About Harry\\" from the musical Shuffle Along by Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake, 1921 Early life Sissle was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on July 10, 1889, around the time his father Rev. George A. Sissle was pastor of the city's Simpson M. E. Chapel.Reef (2010) His mother, Martha Angeline (n√©e Scott) Sissle, was a school teacher and juvenile probation officer. As a youth Sissle sang in church choirs and as a soloist with his high school's glee club in Cleveland, Ohio. Sissle attended De Pauw University in Greencastle, Indiana on scholarship and later transferred to Butler University in Indianapolis before turning to music full-time. Career Noble Lee Sissle circa 1920 (NYPL Digital Collection) In early 1916 Sissle joined one of the society orchestras organized by James Reese Europe in New York. He persuaded Europe to also hire his friend, pianist and composer Eubie Blake, and later in the year helped Europe organize a regimental band for the 15th Infantry Regiment (Colored) of the New York National Guard. This would later become the New York 369th Infantry \\"Hell Fighters\\" Regiment that served nobly in France in World War I, with Europe as a lieutenant and Sissle as his sergeant and lead vocalist.Badger, A Life in Ragtime, 133, 141. Unlike most military bands it played syncopated music and was credited with introducing jazz to France. Sissle left the army after the war as a second lieutenant with the 370th Infantry RegimentNational Cemetery Administration. U.S. Veterans Gravesites, ca.1775-2006[database on-line]. Provo, Utah, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2006. and joined Europe‚Äôs civilian version of the 369th band. Sissle began recording for the Pathe label in early 1917, and sang several vocals on Pathe discs recorded by Europe's 369th Infantry Band in early 1919, after it had become a civilian band.Brooks, Lost Sounds, 365-371. Not long afterwards, on May 9, 1919, James Europe was murdered by a disgruntled band member in Boston, Massachusetts, leaving Sissle, with the help of his friend, Eubie Blake, to take temporary charge of Europe's band. Years earlier Sissle had struck up a partnership with Blake after they first met in Baltimore in 1915.Ebony, July 1973 Shortly after World War I, Sissle joined forces with Blake to form a vaudeville music duo, \\"The Dixie Duo\\". After vaudeville, the pair began work on the jazz musical revue Shuffle Along, which incorporated many songs they had written, and had a book written by F. E. Miller and Aubrey Lyles. When it premiered in 1921, Shuffle Along became the first hit musical on Broadway written by and about African Americans. It was the first all-black show to reach the Broadway stage in over a decade and included a young Josephine Baker among the performers. The musicals also introduced hit songs such as \\"I'm Just Wild About Harry\\" and \\"Love Will Find a Way\\". Sissle and his band appear in a 1931 British Path√©tone Weekly filmed at Ciro's nightclub in London, performing Walter Donaldson's \\"Little White Lies\\" and \\"Happy Feet\\", written by Jack Yellen and Milton Ager. In 1932, Sissle appeared with Nina Mae McKinney, the Nicholas Brothers, and Eubie Blake in Pie, Pie Blackbird, a Vitaphone short released by Warner Brothers. In February 1931, Sissle accompanied Adelaide Hall on piano at the prestigious Palace Theatre (Broadway) in New York during her 1931-32 world tour. In 1954, New York radio station WMGM, which was then owned by Loew's Theatre Organization, signed Sissle as a disc jockey. His show featured the music of African-American recording artists. Sissle was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

As advanced by Mario Alinei in his Origini delle Lingue d‚ÄôEuropa (Origins of the Languages of Europe), published in two volumes in 1996 and 2000, La teoria della continuit√† (1996), Bologna : Mulino , 779 pages ; Continuit√† dal Mesolitico all'et√† del Ferro nelle principali aree etnolinguistiche (2000) Bologna : Mulino, , 1113 pages . the PCT posits that the advent of Indo-European languages should be linked to the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe, at around 40,000 years ago. Employing \\"lexical periodisation\\", Alinei arrives at a timeline deeper even than that of Colin Renfrew's Anatolian hypothesis, previously the mainstream linguistic theory proposing the earliest origin for Indo-European. Since 2004, an informal workgroup of scholars who support the Paleolithic Continuity Theory has been held online. Members of the group (referred to as \\"Scientific Committee\\" in the website) include linguists Xaverio Ballester (University of Valencia) and Francesco Benozzo (University of Bologna), prehistorian Marcel Otte (Universit√© de Li√®ge) and anthropologist Henry Harpending (University of Utah).Alinei, Mario. The Paleolithic Continuity Theory on Indo-European Origins: An Introduction The Paleolithic Continuity Theory is distinctly a minority view as it enjoys very little academic support, serious discussion being limited to a small circle of scholars. It is not listed by Mallory among the proposals for the origins of the Indo-European languages that are widely discussed and considered credible within academia. Overview The framework of PCT is laid out by Alinei in four main assumptions: # Continuity is the basic pattern of European prehistory and the basic working hypothesis on the origins of IE languages. # Stability and antiquity are general features of languages. # The lexicon of natural languages, due to its antiquity, may be \\"periodized\\" along the entire course of human evolution. # Archaeological frontiers coincide with linguistic frontiers. The continuity theory draws on a Continuity Model (CM), positing the presence of IE and non-IE peoples and languages in Europe from Paleolithic times and allowing for minor invasions and infiltrations of local scope, mainly during the last three millennia. Arguing that continuity is \\"the archeologist's easiest pursuit,\\" Alinei deems this \\"the easiest working hypothesis,\\" putting the burden of proof on competing hypotheses as long as none provide irrefutable counter-evidence. Alinei also claims linguistic coherence, rigor and productivity in the pursuit of this approach. Historical reconstruction Associated with the Paleolithic Continuity Theory (PCT) is the historical reconstruction proposed by Alinei, which suggests that Indo-European speakers were native in Europe since the paleolithic. According to this reconstruction, the differentiation process of languages would have taken an extremely long time; by the end of the Ice Age the Indo-European language family had differentiated into proto Celtic/Italic/Germanic/Slavic/Baltic speakers occupying territories within or close to their traditional homelands. The rate of change accelerated when (Neolithic) social stratification and colonial wars began. Summarizing: # The colonial expansion of the Celts started much earlier than La T√®ne culture and proceeded (generally) from West to East, not vice versa. # The Mesolithic cultures of Northern Europe are identified with already differentiated Celtic, Germanic, Baltic and Uralic groups. # Scandinavia was colonized by Germanic groups \\"only\\" after deglaciation, and was better able to preserve its original character in isolation. Germany, in contrast, suffered fragmentation as a result of the Neolithic appearance of the Linear Pottery culture, and developed a wealth of dialects. # The prehistoric distribution of proto- languages akin to Italic was an important factor underlying the current distribution of Romance languages throughout Europe. # The Slavic languages originated in the Balkans and became linked with the Neolithic expansion. This group would be especially identified by the Baden culture. The Paleolithic Continuity hypothesis reverses the Kurgan hypothesis and largely identifies the Indo-Europeans with Gimbutas's \\"Old Europe.\\"Gimbutas, Marija. \\"Old Europe c.7000-3500 BC., the earliest European cultures before the infiltration of the Indo-European peoples\\". Journal of Indo-European Studies, 1, 1973, pp. 1-20. PCT reassigns the Kurgan culture (traditionally considered early Indo- European) to a people of predominantly mixed Uralic and Turkic stock. Alinei argues that the use of borrowed Turkic words in horse terminology, such as qapt√Ø (\\"to grab with hands and teeth\\"), yabu (\\"horse\\"), yam (\\"nomadic caravan- tent\\"), yuntƒÉ (\\"horse\\" (generic)), aygur (\\"stallion\\"), homut (\\"horse collar\\") and ala≈°a (\\"pack horse\\"), in Samoyedic (Northern and Southern), in some Finno- Ugric languages and Slavic languages, \\"proves the antiquity of Turkic presence in the European area bordering Asia.\\" He suggests that horse domestication originated with Turkic peoples, offering this as an explanation why horse terminology in the European area bordering Asia and in most of Eastern Europe is rooted in Turkic and not Indo-European vocabulary.Mario Alinei (2003), \\"Interdisciplinary and linguistic evidence for Paleolithic continuity of Indo- European, Uralic and Altaic populations in Eurasia, with an excursus on Slavic ethnogenesis\\", Quaderni di semantica, vol. 26. He supports this hypothesis by making a tentative linguistic identification of Etruscans as a Uralic, proto- Hungarian people that had already undergone strong proto-Turkic influence in the third millennium BC, when Pontic invasions would have brought this people to the Carpathian Basin. A subsequent migration of Urnfield culture signature around 1250 BC is said to have caused this ethnic group to expand south in a general movement of people. This is equated with the upheaval of the Sea Peoples and the overthrow of an earlier Italic substrate at the onset of the \\"Etruscan\\" Villanovan culture. Genetics In introduction to PCT Mario Alinei argues, following Cavalli Sforza, that the distribution of genetic markers largely corresponds to that of languages. He further contends that 80 percent of Europe's human genetic material dates back to the Paleolithic, and cites Bryan Sykes in claiming that only a fifth of European DNA can be traced back to neolithic incomers. A 2009 study comparing mitochondrial DNA lineages of late hunter-gatherers, early farmers, and modern Europeans found large differences between the three groups. In particular, 82 percent of hunter- gatherers had maternal lineages that are rare in modern central Europeans. The origin of paternal lineages remains difficult to prove because modern science is unable to extract Y-DNA haplogroups from Paleolithic samples. However, the recent analysis of Arredi, Poloni and Tyler-Smith (2007) suggests that R1b-M269, the most common western European haplogroup, may have entered Europe only in the Neolithic. Reception Alinei's Origini delle Lingue d‚ÄôEuropa was reviewed favourably in 1996 by Jonathan Morris in Mother Tongue, a journal dedicated to the reconstruction of Paleolithic language, judging Alinei's theory as being > both simpler than its rivals and more powerful in terms of the insights it > provides into language in the Meso- and Palaeolithic. While his book > contains some flaws I believe that it deserves to be regarded as one of the > seminal texts on linguistic archaeology, although given its lamentable lack > of citation in English-language circles, it appears that recognition will > have to wait until a translation of the original Italian appears. Morris's review was reprinted as the foreword to the 2000 edition of Alinei's book. Renzi (1997) sharply criticized Alinei's book, refuting in particular the claim of the presence of Latin and of its different territorial forms in Italy in the 2nd millennium BC. Renzi argues that this theory would subvert firmly established concepts of Romance philology and dialectology, such as the concepts of substratum, vulgar Latin and so on.Alinei, ovvero il latino prima di Roma, RID. Rivista italiana di dialettologia, ISSN 1122-6331, 1997, vol. 21, pp. 191-202.

The PzH 2000 is one of the most powerful conventional artillery systems deployed in the 2010s. It is capable of a very high rate of fire; in burst mode it can fire three rounds in nine seconds, ten rounds in 56 seconds, and can‚Äîdepending on barrel heating‚Äîfire between 10 and 13 rounds per minute continuously.Army Technology with data on PzH 2000 The PzH 2000 has automatic support for up to 5 rounds of Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact (MRSI). The replenishment of shells is automated. Two operators can load 60 shells and propelling charges in less than 12 minutes. PzH 2000 has also been selected by the armies of Italy, Netherlands, Greece, Lithuania and Croatia, and more orders are probable as many NATO forces replace their M109 howitzers.  Development  In 1986 Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany agreed to terminate their existing development of the PzH 155-1 (SP70) programme, which had run into reliability problems and had design defects, notably being mounted on a modified tank chassis. A new Joint Ballistics Memorandum of Understanding (JBMOU) for a 52 calibre barrel (based on a UK proposal) to replace 39 calibre was nearing agreement. German industry was asked for proposals to build a new design with gun conforming to the JBMOU. Of the proposed designs, Wegmann's was selected. Wegman eventually won a contract in 1996 for 185 to be delivered to Germany's rapid reaction force, followed by another 410 for the main force. Wegmann and Krauss-Maffei, the two main German military tracked vehicle designers, merged in 1998 to form KMW.  Design  Rheinmetall designed the 155 mm 52-calibre JBMOU compliant gun, which is chromium-lined for its entire 8 metre length and includes a muzzle brake on the end. The gun uses a new modular charge system with six charges (five identical), which can be combined to provide the optimal total charge for the range to the target, as well as the conventional bagged charge systems. Primer is loaded separately via a conveyor belt, and the entire loading, laying and clearing is completely automated. The maximum range of the gun is 30‚Äì36 km with the standard DM121 Boattail round, about 40‚Äì47 km with base bleed rounds, and 67 km with M2005 V-LAP assisted projectiles.Panzerhaubitze 2000 ‚Äì Konzepte zur Schlie√üung der Reichweitenl√ºcke In April 2006 a PzH 2000 shot assisted shells (Denel V-Lap) over a distance of 56 km with a probable maximum range of over 60 km.KMweg.de The gun can also fire the SMArt 155 artillery round, which is used by Germany and Greece. Wegmann supplied both the chassis, sharing some components with the Leopard 2, and the turret for the gun. The system has superb cross-country performance because of its use of continuous tracks and considerable protection in the case of counter-fire. The turret includes a phased array radar on the front glacis for measuring the muzzle velocity of each round fired. Laying data can be automatically provided via encrypted radio from the battery fire direction centre. A lighter, more air-portable version, using the gun in a module fitted to a lighter chassis, has been developed by KMW. It is called the Artillery Gun Module. In December 2013, Raytheon and the German Army completed compatibility testing for the M982 Excalibur extended range guided artillery shell with the PzH 2000. Ten Excaliburs were fired at ranges from 9 to 48 kilometers. Shells hit within three meters of their targets, with an average miss distance of one meter at 48 km. The Excalibur may be accepted by the German Army in 2014.German Army PzH 2000 Howitzer Test Fires Excalibur 155mm Artillery Projectile - Deagel.com, 10 December 2013 A PzH 2000 L52 gun fired a shell to a range of 67 km at the Alkantpan test range in South Africa on 6 November 2019.Rheinmetall develops new long-range howitzer Combat record and alterations Panzerhaubitze 2000 - Bundeswehr Military History Museum, Dresden The PzH 2000 was used for the first time in combat by the Dutch Army in August 2006 against Taliban targets in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Medusa. Since then it has been used regularly in support of coalition troops in Uruzgan province, also in Afghanistan. The PzH 2000 was also used extensively during the Battle of Chora. It is known as \\"the long arm of ISAF\\". The gun has been criticised by the Dutch in Uruzgan province as the NBC system designed for use in Europe cannot cope with the high level of dust in Afghanistan. The guns have been modified with additional armor being fitted to the roof to protect against mortar rounds. There have been other reports of problems including the need to keep it in the shade unless actually firing, the damage it does to poorly built roads and a significant 'cold gun' effect necessitating the use of 'warmers'. Since the beginning of June 2010, German ISAF troops at PRT Kunduz have three PzH 2000 at their disposal. They were first used on 10 July 2010 to provide support for the recovery of a damaged vehicle. This was the first time in its history the Bundeswehr has used heavy artillery in combat.Bundeswehr setzt erstmals schwere Artillerie ein . Hamburger Abendblatt, 12 July 2010 The PzH 2000 also played a key role during Operation Halmazag in November 2010, when the villages of Isa Khel and Quatliam were retaken from the Taliban by German paratroopers.Der Kampf um Quatliam , by David Schraven Operators Map of PzH 2000 operators in blue Italian Army PzH 2000 in Qatar =Current operators= * : 16 ordered; 12 to be modernized and overhauled, 3 for spare parts, 1 for training.

The PzH 2000 was considered for the US Army's Crusader concept system, but several requirements of the Crusader made it unsuitable. The Crusader specifications placed the crew and gun in separate compartments, allowing a single highly armoured crew compartment to control the firing of an entire battery of guns through intervehicle links. In addition the Crusader included an automated ammunition tender, and an active cooled barrel. The PzH 2000 was a contender for Phase 1C of Australia's Land 17 Artillery Replacement Programme prior to that phase of the project being cancelled in May 2012. Finland tested one alongside the 155mm SpGH ZUZANA and AS-90 \\"Braveheart\\". Tests ended in 1998 and due to cost efficiency issues no self-propelled gun system was selected, but instead more of the cheaper 155 K 98 field guns were bought. The German Navy evaluated a modified system known as MONARC for installation onboard frigates; while the system performed well components were difficult to protect against corrosion. Sweden evaluated a slightly modified version but selected the ARCHER Artillery System instead. In December 2018, Hungary ordered 24 newly built PzH 2000s from Krauss-Maffei Wegmann together with 44 Leopard 2A7+ and 12 Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks in a deal valued at over 160 billion HUF ($565 million).

When children in Germany and in parts of the Czech Republic close to the German border, in parts of Poland (Greater Poland, Upper Silesia, Warmia), in Austria, and in the German- speaking parts of Switzerland and Belgium set off for their first day of school upon entering first grade, their parents and/or grandparents present them with this large cone, attractively decorated and filled with toys, chocolate, candies/sweets, school supplies, and various other special treats. The cone is given to children to make this anxiously awaited first day of school a little sweeter.File:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-0557-15A, Erster Schultag.jpgGirl with a Schult√ºte, 1953 File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006209 026 Portr√§t eines Jungen mit Zuckert√ºte.jpgBoy with a Schult√ºte in Leipzig, 1951 Image:Schultuete ausgepackt.jpg History The name translates as cone, even though the German word \\"T√ºte\\" is translated into English in most other contexts as \\"bag\\"‚Äîsee also ). The tradition of the Schult√ºte has its origins in approximately the year 1810 in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia in Germany. The first documented report of cone-shaped Schult√ºten comes from the city of Jena in 1817, closely followed by reports from Dresden (1820) and Leipzig (1836). It started in the larger cities but spread quickly to small towns and villages, soon becoming an institution all over Germany. In the early days of the concept of the Schult√ºte, before it spread to other parts of Germany, the usual routine was not to hand over the cone to the children personally. Marked with the students' names, the cones were taken to the school by grandparents or godparents and in a ritual reminiscent of the Mexican pi√±ata, they were hung on a metal Schult√ºten-Baum (school-cone tree) from which each child had to pick his or her cone, without breaking it. The story told to the children claimed that there was a Schult√ºten-Baum growing at the school, and if that tree's fruits (i.e. the Schult√ºten) were ripe and large enough to pick, it was then time to go to school for the first time. The only custom that changed in the latter half of the 20th century is that fewer sweets seem to appear in the Schult√ºte, with more practical gifts such as crayons and pencils, small toys, CDs, books and even articles of clothing replacing the traditional chocolates and candies/sweets. These are traditionally given by grandparents who also take the child out to dinner the evening before school begins. If they are not made by the parents, the school cones can be bought from shops ready-made or they are made by the children themselves in the kindergarten. Christiane Cantauw, a German folklore expert at the Volkskundliche Kommission f√ºr Westfalen (Folkloristic Commission of Westphalia, based in the city of M√ºnster), has researched the Schult√ºte tradition. In a 2016 interview with the broadcaster Deutsche Welle she explained how important the symbolism of the Schult√ºte tradition is for school beginners and their families, regardless of their financial means: Shapes After the division of Germany, hexagonal school cones with a length of 85 cm were established in East Germany, while the traditional round cones (usually 70 cm long) were preferred in the West.Hans-G√ºnter L√∂we: Schulanfang.

The name is derived from the Greek words ·º∞Œ±œÑœÅœåœÇ (iatros), meaning \\"physician\\", and œÑœÅŒøœÜŒÆ (trophe), meaning \\"nutrition\\", hence the common name physic nut. Another common name is nettlespurge. It contains approximately 170 species of succulent plants, shrubs and trees (some are deciduous, like Jatropha curcas). Most of these are native to the Americas, with 66 species found in the Old World. Plants produce separate male and female flowers. As with many members of the family Euphorbiaceae, Jatropha contains compounds that are highly toxic. Jatropha species have traditionally been used in basketmaking, tanning and dye production. In the 2000s, one species, Jatropha curcas, generated interest as an oil crop for biodiesel production and also medicinal importance when used as lamp oil; native Mexicans in the Veracruz area developed by selective breeding a Jatropha curcas variant lacking the toxic compounds, yielding a better income when used as source for Biodiesel, because of its edible byproduct. Toxicity may return if edible Jatropha is pollinated by toxic types. Uses Jatropha pandurifolia in China The stems of haat (Jatropha cuneata) are used for basketmaking by the Seri people in Sonora, Mexico. The stems are roasted, split and soaked through an elaborate process. The reddish dye that is often used is made from the root of another plant species, Krameria grayi. Spicy jatropha (J. integerrima) is cultivated as an ornamental in the tropics for its continuously blooming crimson flowers. Buddha belly plant (J. podagrica) was used to tan leather and produce a red dye in Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is also used as a house plant. The oil from Jatropha curcas is mainly converted into biodiesel for use in diesel engines. The cake resulting from oil extraction, a protein-rich product, can be used for fish or animal feed (if detoxified). It is also a biomass feedstock to power electricity plants or to produce biogas, and a high-quality organic fertilizer.Heuz√© V., Tran G., Edouard N., Renaudeau D., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2016.

However, despite their abundance and use as oil and reclamation plants, none of the Jatropha species have been properly domesticated and, as a result, their productivity is variable, and the long- term impact of their large-scale use on soil quality and the environment is unknown.World Agroforestry Centre (2007) When oil grows on trees World Agroforestry Centre press release. 26 April 2009. 2009 research found that Jatropha biodiesel production requires significantly more water than other common biofuel crops, and that initial yield estimates were high. Earlier, higher estimates from Worldwatch Institute had suggested that 1 acre of cultivation could yield 202 gallons (4.8 barrels) of biodiesel. Jatropha curcas is also being studied for use as a carbon sequestration plant in arid regions.K. Becker, V. Wulfmeyer, T. Berger, J. Gebel, and W. M√ºnch: \\"K. Becker1, V. Wulfmeyer2, T. Berger3, J. Gebel4, and W. M√ºnch\\", Earth system dynamics, 4, 237-251, 2013. Toxicity Much like other members of the family Euphorbiaceae, members of the genus Jatropha contain several toxic compounds. The seeds of Jatropha curcas contain the highly poisonous toxalbumin curcin, a lectin dimer. They also contain carcinogenic phorbol.http://www.drugsandpoisons.com/2008/01/lectins-peas-and-beans-gone- bad.html Despite this, the seeds are occasionally eaten after roasting, which reduces some of the toxicity. Its sap is a skin irritant, and ingesting as few as three untreated seeds can be fatal to humans. In 2005 Western Australia banned Jatropha gossypiifolia as invasive and highly toxic to people and animals. Even though it was used as medicine in certain geographic regions, it was found to have no antimicrobial activity.Ilango, S. and David Paul Raj RS. 2015.

On a seasonal island on the bank of the Betwa River, which has been surrounded by a battlement wall, stands a huge palace-fort. The fort consists of several connected buildings erected at different times, the most noteworthy of which is the Raja Mahal. Chaturbhuj Temple at Orchha, is noted for having one of the tallest Vimana among Hindu temples standing at 344 feet. The Ram Raja Temple is built on a square base and has an almost entirely plain exterior, relieved by projecting windows and a line of delicate domes along the summit. The Jahangir Mahal is built on a rectangular base and is relieved by a circular tower at each corner surmounted by a dome, while two lines of graceful balconies supported on brackets mark the central storeys. The roof is crowned by eight large fluted domes, with smaller domes between them, connected by an ornamental balustrade. The Jahangir Mahal is considered to be a singularly beautiful specimen of Mughal architecture. A point worth mentioning here is that the mother for Jahangir was also a Rajput, Jodha. It is with this in mind that the Rajput king of Orchha had built the Jahangir Mahal. There is a spectacular light and sound show in the evening hours in the Jahangir Mahal. The show displays the history of the city of Orchha and the Jahangir Mahal. Chaturbhuj Temple is an old temple from the 9th century, and is noted for having one of the tallest Vimana among Hindu temples standing at 344 feet. The Uth Khana (Camel Shelter) where the King's camels were stationed is right next to the fort and is a must-see. Tourists can also climb on the roof of the Uth Khana and get a fantastic view of Orchha town. The ruins behind the fort complex are an even greater sight. It makes a tourist travel back in time and is an integral part of a visit to Orchha. It houses the residences of various military officers, ministers (housing, roads), gunpowder factory, etc. Numerous cenotaphs or chhatris dot the vicinity of the fort and the Betwa river. Elsewhere about the town there is an unusual variety of temples and tombs, including the Chaturbhuj temple, which is built on a vast platform of stone. The more unguarded and neglected of these buildings are popular hangouts for tropical bees, wasps, and other such excitable stinging creatures. In 2006, Orchha's buildings were being documented by the LIK Team of IIT Roorkee, India.Mission Orchha Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee A community radio station, Radio Bundelkhand was launched in Orchha on 23 October 2008.

A beluga whale is flensed for its maktaaq (skin), an important source of vitamin C. Indigenous whaling is the hunting of whales by indigenous peoples. It is permitted under international regulation, but in some countries remains a contentious issue. (The hunting of smaller cetaceans is covered at Dolphin drive hunting.) It is usually considered part of the subsistence economy. In some places whaling has been superseded by whale watching instead. This article deals with communities that continue to hunt; details about communities that have ended the practice may be found at History of whaling. International regulation Under the terms of the 1986 moratorium, the International Whaling Commission allows the activity to be carried out by aboriginal groups if it occurs on a subsistence basis, similar to subsistence fishing. This Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling is restricted to native peoples and others working on their behalf, as defined by the IWC. The IWC says that: :Since its inception, the IWC has recognised that indigenous or 'aboriginal subsistence' whaling is of a different nature to commercial whaling. It is thus not subject to the moratorium. This is reflected in the different objectives for the two types of whaling. For aboriginal subsistence whaling the objectives are to: :*ensure that risks of extinction are not seriously increased by whaling; :*enable native people to hunt whales at levels appropriate to their cultural and nutritional requirements (also called 'need'); and :*move populations towards and then maintain them at healthy levels. In order for a country to carry out a hunt under the aboriginal group clause, the nation must provide the IWC with evidence of \\"the cultural and subsistence needs of their people.\\" In particular, the hunt is not intended for commercial purposes and the caught meat cannot be exported. United States whaling Alaska beluga harvest in 2007 In the United States whaling is carried out by Alaska Natives and by the Makah of Washington State. It no longer occurs on the Atlantic coast, although the Pilgrim Fathers found the original inhabitants of New England had a well-developed understanding of drift whales. =Alaska= The Arctic whaling program is managed by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, which reports to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The commission includes eleven whaling communities which inhabit the Arctic Alaska coast: the Gambell, Savoonga, Wales, Little Diomede, Kivalina, Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainwright, Barrow, Nuiqsut, and Kaktovik. In 2015 Alaska Natives caught 326 beluga whales and 49 bowhead whales. Total numbers 428 belugas and 43 bowheads are average 2011-2015 and include belugas in Canadian portion of Beaufort Sea. In 2016 they caught 59 bowhead whales, two minke and one humpback whale; The latter two species were not authorized, though no one was prosecuted. Annual catches vary between 300 and 500 belugas and 40 to 70 bowheads. The hunt takes the bowhead whales from a population of about 10,000 in Alaskan waters. Anti-whaling groups claim this hunt is not sustainable, though the IWC Scientific Committee, the same group that provided the above population estimate, projects a population growth of 3.2% per year. The hunt also took an average of one or two gray whales each year until 1996. The quota was reduced to zero in that year due to concerns about sustainability. =Washington State= Members from the Makah tribe getting ready to harvest a whale, 1910 According to federal law, the Makah people of Washington State are entitled to hunt and kill one baleen whale, typically a gray whale, each year, though archeological records and oral history indicate a significant number of humpback whales were hunted as well. The Makah ended their whaling practices in the 1920s, but notified the U.S Government of their wish to reassert their whaling rights in 1995. The first permitted Makah whale hunt in 70 years occurred on May 17, 1999, when they caught a north Pacific gray whale, an unpermitted hunt killed another in 2007, and in 2018 they took meat from a humpback killed by a ship strike. An environmental impact statement for further hunts was issued in 2015. On April 5, 2019 NOAA Fisheries proposed issuing a waiver under the MMPA to the Makah tribe to allow hunting, as well as a what stakeholders can do to engage in the public rule making process before an Administrative Law Judge. One of the main stipulations that NOAA proposed was allowing the Makah people to hunt as many as 20 gray whales every five years, however prior to any hunt the tribe would have to obtain a permit from NOAA. On August 2, 2019 the Administrative Law Judge announced that the final agenda for the hearing on NOAA's proposed waiver and regulations was set for November 2019, which was postponed from the previous June 26, 2019 announcement. Canadian whaling Bowhead whale caught in Igloolik, Nunavut in 2002. Canada left the IWC in 1982 and as such is not bound by the moratorium. Whaling is carried out by various Inuit groups in the Canadian Arctic in small numbers and is managed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Russian whaling Russians of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the Russian Far East are permitted to take up to 140 gray whales from the North- East Pacific population each year. Caribbean whaling Some whaling is conducting from Grenada, Dominica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Saint Lucia. Species hunted are the short-finned pilot whale, pygmy killer whale and spinner dolphins. Throughout the Caribbean, around 400 pilot whales are killed annually with the meat being sold locally. This hunting of small cetaceans is not regulated by the IWC. Whales are hunted in Bequia, the second largest of the Grenadines. Natives of Bequia are allowed to catch up to four humpback whales per year using only traditional hunting methods of hand-thrown harpoons in small, open sailboats. The limit is rarely met, with no catch some years. Its classification as aboriginal, and therefore permissible, is highly contested. In the 2012 meeting of the IWC, delegates from several anti-whaling countries, and environmental groups, spoke out against it, calling it \\"artisanal whaling out of control,\\" Faroese whaling Whalers in the Faroe Islands take approximately 800 long-finned pilot whales per year. These hunts are called grindadr√°p in Faroese. Indonesian whaling Lamakera whale hunters in a traditional boat called paledang. 1900. Lamalera, on the south coast of the island of Lembata, and Lamakera on neighbouring Solor are the last two remaining Indonesian whaling communities. The hunters have religious taboos that ensure that they use every part of the animal. About half of the catch is kept in the village; the rest is traded in local markets, using barter. The whale hunts are carried out in a traditional manner, with bamboo spears and small wooden outriggers, 10‚Äì12 m long and 2m wide, constructed without nails and with sails woven from palm fronds. The animals are killed by the harpooner leaping onto the back of the animal, from the boat, to drive in the harpoon. A dead whale on the beach at Lamakera, surrounded by villagers. 1900. The people of Lamalera hunt several species of whales, primarily sperm whales (the baleen whale is taboo), and in the peak year of 1969 caught 56 sperm whales. In addition to whales, dolphins, manta rays, turtles and several species of sharks are also hunted. In 1973, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization sent a whaling ship and a Norwegian master whaler, to modernize the hunt. This effort lasted three years, and was not successful. According to the FAO report, the Lamalerans \\"have evolved a method of whaling which suits their natural resources, cultural tenets and style.\\" The World Wildlife Fund has carried out surveys in the village to determine that the limited hunting does not endanger world whale stocks or other endangered species.  Issues that threaten aboriginal whaling rights  Commercial whaling and poachers hunt whales in large quantities and sell them illegally . The International Whaling Commission (IWC) does not allow the hunting of any whales except for aboriginal subsistence whaling and scientific whaling, which have catch limits to maintain the conservation of whales. These groups must report their hunts and the number of whales killed in order to track the population of whale species and conservation. Hunting illegally means the kills are not reported, which makes it difficult to maintain population numbers and conservation.

His Ti√´sto in Concert DVD caught their attention, after which he was asked to write more tracks based on his opening tune \\"Adagio for Strings\\" which would fit in with the Olympic spirit and combine the classical with the modern age. The first rehearsal was on 7 August, for an empty stadium; the second rehearsal was on 8 August, with 35,000 volunteers. The last rehearsal included almost 60,000 people in the stadium which was on 10 August. During the course of his performance at the Olympics, the Dutch athletes started dancing in front of the DJ booth and had to be moved on by officials. The performance included new tracks produced especially for the Opening Ceremony and songs that were created to complement the spirit and theme of the ceremony. A condensed studio-recorded album of the songs played on the Olympic set was later released, including new songs specially composed for the occasion, entitled Parade of the Athletes in October 2004. In the liner notes, he noted the IOC requested that the music not contain any lyrics as they could be inadvertently misinterpreted. In late 2004, he began his touring across Latin America, with his release of In Search of Sunrise 3: Panama in which he gained influence from the sun and sand in summer 2002.

In a 2014 interview with DJ Magazine, Ti√´sto revealed why he left trance music. When asked whether his decision to leave the genre was influential to his popularity in the United States, the Dutch producer said: \\"Maybe, it's hard to say. I think I'd still be the 'Tiesto trance guy' but the difference is you're not really being relevant. Some of the old trance guys still have their following but it doesn't feel like anybody really cares ‚Äì and that's the biggest difference. It's nice to be in touch with the new kids who are coming up ‚Äì the 16 and 18-year olds who are producing house music see me as kind of a godfather, and it's really cool to be in touch with them. I think if I'd still been a trance DJ, they'd have been so disconnected with that sound that I wouldn't be much inspiration for them, and vice versa.\\" In 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, he won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for his remixed version of John Legend's hit \\"All of Me\\".

Biography Born in Boucherville, Quebec, Desmarteau was member of the Montr√©al Athletic Club was one of the top competitors in the 56 lb (25.4 kg) weight throwing event, which is no longer an Olympic event. In 1902 he had won the American AAU championships, beating John Flanagan. Flanagan broke the world record in the event prior to the 1904 Olympics, making him one of the favourites for the event along with Desmarteau. To compete in the Olympics, Desmarteau, a police officer in Montr√©al, had to ask for a leave of absence to go to St. Louis, but he was denied by his employer. He decided to go anyway, which cost him his job. In St. Louis, his first throw was 34 ft 4 in (10.46 m), enough for victory over Flanagan, who did not manage better than a 33 ft 4 in (10.16 m) throw. At the 1904 Olympics, Desmarteau was the only non-American to win in the field events. Desmarteau received a hero's welcome back in Montr√©al and was rehired as a police officer. The following year, he died, possibly of typhoid fever. A district, a park and a sports arena in Montr√©al have been named after him; the √âtienne Desmarteau Centre was used as a venue for basketball during the 1976 Summer Olympics. The District d'√âtienne Desmarteau is part of the borough of Rosemont‚ÄìLa Petite-Patrie. It is contended that Desmarteau was the first Olympic Games champion from Canada, although 1900 Summer Olympics champion George Orton, who ran for an American university, was also Canadian.

The final evolution of the Type 88 design, the Type 96 entered service with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1997. The later variants of the Type 96 are regarded as near-equivalents to China's third generation MBT. History China's tank development can be divided into three generations. The first generation was the Type 59, a locally manufactured copy of the Soviet T-54 and its derivative tanks. The second generation of MBTs started with the Type 80 and ended with the Type 88/Type 96. The third generation began with the Type 97 tank. China's first-generation tank development program failed to meet the PLA's performance requirements. These technical shortcomings coincided with the appearance of the T-72 tank in Russia, which influenced Chinese defense officials and contributed to their decision to begin development of a new indigenous MBT in the early 1980s. This new program was to lead to the development of the Type 80/85 family by 1988. Chinese Type 85-IIM Tank, Export version of Type 96 tank. The Type 80 prototypes were accepted into PLA service as the Type 88A/B. Most distinctively, the Type 88 family had six road wheels instead of the five that the previous Chinese MBTs possessed. However, the PLA soon realized that the Type 88 design was insufficient to reach parity with contemporary designs after the 1991 Gulf War. A better domestic MBT was required. However, continued delays in China's third gen MBT development meant the PLA had no choice but to continue development of the Type 85 family. In 1995, Norinco produced the Type 85-III prototype with an upgraded engine and explosive reactive armor. In 1997, the upgraded Type 85-IIM prototypes were accepted into PLA service as the Type 88C/Type 96. The most visible difference between the Type 96 and earlier Type 88 series tanks was the additional spaced armor on the turret front. This spaced armor gave the Type 96 a rectangular front profile, visually distinguishing it from the round turret of the Type 88. Other visible differences included their armament: The Type 96 possessed a locally designed 125mm smoothbore gun while the earlier Type 88 variants used a 105mm rifled gun instead. By mid-2016, the Chinese military had over 7,000 tanks in active service of which, there were about 2,077 Type 96/Type 96As and about 814 Type 99/Type 99As. Compared to the Type 99 with its high capability and similarly high cost, the cheaper Type 96B is seen by domestic experts as the main tank in the modernization of the PLA.Type-96B seen as pillar of nation's tank force - China.org.cn, 10 August 2016 = International Tank Biathlon = In 2014, China participated with the Type 96A in the Russian- hosted tank biathlon where it competed against the Russian T-72B3, clinching third place. China participated again in 2015, coming in second place. In 2016, it won one gold medal (out of a total of 23 awarded gold medals). = Deployment = The Type 96 is the PLA's main armored firepower for maneuver warfare units. 31 tanks are deployed in an armored battalion and 10 tanks are deployed in a company.

Also sometimes mistakenly referred to as the Type 88C. Renamed Type 96 when put into PLA service. In comparison to the Type 85 and Type 88, the Type 96 features a more powerful engine, improved electronics and a western-style turret. Type 96 was accepted by the PLA in 1996. =Type 96A= Chinese Type 96A MBT at Tank Biathlon 2014. Additional \\"arrow shaped\\" modular armor similar to the Type 99 is installed on the turret front. The back of the hull is now completely flat compared to the Type 96. The Type 96A was first revealed in 2006, but in-service tanks were first seen in a military parade in 2009. The Type 96A is a third-generation upgrade of the Type 96. Its internal electronics may have been upgraded to Type 99 standards. The visual profile of the Type 96A is similar to the Type 99. However, the Type 96A can be distinguished from the Type 99 by the driver's position of the left side of the hull. FY-4 ERA was added on front upper glacis. The vehicle is equipped with a thermal imager. Features an upgraded 800 hp engine. A laser defense system similar to the Shtora has been installed as well. Electro-optical jammers which are able to jam enemy guided missiles, rangefinders, and designators are found on the tank. =Type 96B= Chinese Type 96B MBT at Tank Biathlon 2017. Variant first seen in July 2016 loaded on a Russia-bound train to participate in the 2016 Tank biathlon. It is equipped with an improved engine, improved high-performance gun with an upgraded fire-control system, new transmission, chassis, ventilation, communications and computer systems, exhaust and suspension. Additionally it features an independent commander sight and lighter, more reliable running wheels. Compared to the previous variants, the two exhausts that were originally located on the right side of the hull is now located on the rear hull with air vents. The specifications of the upgraded engine are unknown but is speculated to produce between 1,000 and 1,200 horsepower.http://3g.china.com/act/military/11132797/20160706/22997466.html?shouye = VT-2 = VT-2 Tank Export variant of Type-96A.

It was generally viewed to be further left than Alexa McDonough's leadership, but not as far left as the Socialist Caucus. The NPI believed that the NDP was moving too close to the right, and was dangerously close to becoming another Liberal Party. It believed in uniting Canada's left to combat that. The NPI viewed Canada's left as being more than just the labour unions, but rather as appealing to a staunch left wing who believe in anti- globalization, feminism, gay rights, and environmentalism. The NPI attributed the poor showing of the NDP in recent years to having alienated its left-wing base by moving towards the centre, and wished to bring these activists into the NDP by adopting their views. The NPI was founded in June 2001, and was soon joined by British Columbian Members of Parliament Libby Davies and Svend Robinson. Other prominent members included Judy Rebick and Jim Stanford. The NPI originally called for the NDP to disband and form another, more left wing, party under a different name with the participation of social movements. It was said that this would have followed the path set by the NDP when it was created in 1961 by its predecessor party, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, and labour unions, but the NPI did not propose a formal merger, but a disbanding. The NPI never articulated a specific plan for how social movements could be integrated into the NDP. At the NDP convention held in Winnipeg in November 2001, opponents of the initiative used that lack of detail to defeat the proposal. The NPI's resolution managed to win the support of almost 40 per cent of convention delegates. When Jack Layton won the NDP leadership in January 2003, it was taken as a victory by the NPI, with whom Layton had sympathized, but never joined. Key NPI leaders such as Robinson, Davies and Rebick supported Layton's campaign for leader. With Layton's election the NPI became less vocal and formally dissolved in early 2004, with a concluding public meeting being held on February 22.

Marie, Ontario. It is one of the largest tributaries on the eastern lake, draining an area of approximately . The river and its tributaries were used to transport logs to local sawmills during the second half of the 19th century. The Algoma Central Railway travels up the river valley on its way to the Agawa canyon. At one time, the river was an important spawning area for lake sturgeon. However, logging operations, fishing and the installation of an electric barrier to prevent sea lampreys from travelling upstream (removed in 1960) have reduced sturgeon activity in the river. The river is used for recreational canoeing, kayaking, and swimming, and the headwaters and parts of the river have been protected by the Goulais River Provincial Park. The river's name is thought to come from the French word goulet or \\"narrow passage\\", which is also the source of the English words \\"gully\\" and \\"gullet\\". The French called the area at the river's mouth Anse de la p√™che or \\"Fish Inlet\\". The Goulais River is a popular yellow pickerel fishing area. The river is also home to bass, brook trout, and other species. Goulais River Provincial Park Since 2003, a section of the river is protected in the Goulais River Provincial Park. It is a waterway park consisting of a strip of land along both shores of the river.

It consists of a tube, with darts approximately in length. Unlike modern Western blowguns, the fukiya has no mouthpiece: instead, a shooter must maintain a seal with the lips as he or she forcefully exhales. The darts used in the fukiya are called fukibari. Traditionally, fukibari were two inches in length. In Japan, fukiya is considered to be an archery sport, maintained by the Japan Sports Fukiya Association. In order to promote fukiya, the International Fukiya Association (IFA) was formed, based in Japan. The main organizations under the IFA are the American Association (ASBA), and the French Federation (FSBA). History The fukiya is often considered to have been a weapon of the ninja. It is known that in the past, there were numerous schools of martial arts and ninjutsu (such as Togakure-ry≈´) which used the fukiya and fukibari alone (as senbon). A typical ninjutsu fukiya is around 50 cm, which is shorter than the sport fukiya, but does affect the effective range. Thus, even in theory, ninja would have had to use special darts with poisoned tips in order for it to work, and fired from a concealed location. Most likely, it was used similar to shuriken, as a distraction. The blowgun can also double as a breathing pipe and straw to enable the ninja practitioner to better survive in the wilderness. There will always be doubts whether it was truly effective compared to bow and arrows, since it has a shorter range. In the hands of experts (\\"Master\\" level), it can be very accurate, as testified by sport fukiya players today.  Science of fukiya  The range of a fukiya is determined by size (diameter), weight, length and material of its basic component, the tube. Pressure built up in the tube from the player's breath and the technique that the player uses to channel the breath into the tube affects the speed that the dart will exit the muzzle. Weight will affect a player's ability to hold the tube steady, and arm fatigue level over a period of time. Sport fukiya Like any sport, fukiya has certain guidelines for its equipment. In general, international guidelines set by IFA are less strict than JSFA. Currently, the specifications for international competitions are as follows: *Equipment: Can be self-made (Japanese competitions require properly made equipment) **Pipe ***length: 120 cm (4 ft); For practice at home, students can employ a 50 cm pipe, with the target placed at 5 to 6 metres away ***diameter: 13mm (.51 cal) if possible; anywhere between 12mm to 13mm, so .50 cal (1/2\\") is acceptable for International competition ***Weight: 150g for beginners; 600g for advanced **Darts: wedge shape if possible; conical shape is acceptable; guidelines can vary ***length: Approximately 20 cm in length ***weight: 0.8g *Competition **Distance from target: 10m; 8m for handicap competitors; 6m for novice; (5-6m for practice, using a shorter blowgun) **Number of darts in use: 30 **Target: 3 rings ***bulls-eye: 6 cm diameter, 7 points ***inner ring: 12 cm in diameter, 5 points ***outer ring: 18 cm in diameter, 3 points ***Bulleye's height from the ground: 160 cm (90 cm for handicap) **Point calculation: 6 rounds of 5 shots are taken, with a maximum score of 210 points **Time allotted: not exceeding 25 minutes, for all 30 darts, including shooting, scoring, retrieval, and cleaning the barrel *Level advancement (minimum score required) **3 kyu: 60 points **2 kyu: 75 points **1 kyu: 90-105 points (depends on association) **shodan: 105-119 points (depends on association) **2 dan: 120 points **3 dan: 150 points **4 dan: 162 points **5 dan: 175 points **Master level I: three 186 points scores Associations *International Fukiya Association **United States Blowgun Association (USA) *Japan Sport Fukiya Association (Japan) Sources *IFA FAQ, English version (Japanese version here) External links * Category:Blowgun Category:Ninjutsu artefacts Category:Personal weapons Category:Primitive weapons Category:Weapons of Japan ","title":"Fukiya"},{"id":"892413","text":"Interstate 590 (I-590) is a north‚Äìsouth auxiliary Interstate Highway that serves the immediate southeastern suburbs of the city of Rochester, New York, in the United States. It extends for from an interchange with I-390 in Brighton to the Can of Worms, a complex interchange connecting I-590 to I-490 (the Eastern Expressway) just inside the Rochester city line. I-590 makes up the southeast quadrant of the Rochester Outer Loop, which continues west on I-390 and north past the Can of Worms on New York State Route 590 (NY 590). The highway is a spur route of I-90; the connection between the two is made via both I-390 and I-490. The portion of I-590 between Winton Road and the Can of Worms was originally constructed in the 1960s and designated as part of NY 47 from Elmwood Avenue northward. In the late 1970s, I-590 was proposed as a designation for the entire southern half of the Outer Loop. Ultimately, it was cut back to its current western terminus at the then-proposed I-390. I-590 was officially assigned in 1980 following the elimination of NY 47, and the last segment of the freeway between Winton Road and I-390 was completed by the following year. Route description Northern terminus of I-590 at the Can of Worms I-590 begins at a semi-directional T interchange with I-390 in the town of Brighton, a southern suburb of the city of Rochester. The route heads east from the junction, passing under South Clinton Avenue (which passes through the east half of the interchange but does not connect to either freeway) and traveling east through open fields to its first interchange (a diverging diamond interchange) at South Winton Road. Here, the surroundings rapidly change from fields to densely populated residential areas as it passes through a more developed section of Brighton. As it approaches NY 31 (Monroe Avenue) at exit 2, I-590 turns a full 90 degrees to the north. Past NY 31, I-590 runs through the former Erie Canal and Rochester Subway bed. The freeway travels due north along this stretch, flanked on both sides by residential neighborhoods separated from I-590 only by sound barriers. Not far to the north of the intersection with NY 31 is exit 3, a partial diamond interchange for Elmwood Avenue permitting access from I-590 south and to I-590 north. Prior to 1980, NY 47 entered the freeway at this point and followed both I-590 and NY 590 north to Sea Breeze. Another partial interchange with Highland Avenue follows at exit 4‚Äîmaking the two connections that exit 3 omits‚Äîbefore I-590 enters the Can of Worms, a complex interchange connecting I-590 to I-490. North of the ramps leading to I-490, I-590 descends northeastward into a cut and passes below both I-490 and NY 96 as it becomes NY 590, which continues onward toward Sea Breeze. History I-590 southbound in Brighton during rush hour I-590 appeared on maps of the Rochester area as early as 1977 as a designation for the portion of the Rochester Outer Loop south of I-490. At the time, only two portions of the loop‚Äîfrom I-490 in Gates southeast to NY 383 in Chili and from Winton Road in Brighton to I-490 in Rochester‚Äîwere complete and open to traffic. The western portion was constructed and designated as part of NY 47. The eastern section, which opened from Monroe Avenue (NY 31) to the Can of Worms and from NY 31 west to Winton Road by 1968, was part of NY 47 between Elmwood Avenue and I-490. South of Elmwood Avenue, the expressway had no signed number as the Federal Highway Administration had yet to assign the I-590 designation. Construction on the missing section of the Outer Loop's southern half began in the late 1970s. Around the same time, the state of New York began to look into the possibility of changing the designations that were assigned to the Outer Loop. In one proposal submitted to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in the late 1970s, I-590 would be truncated to begin at the then-proposed junction with I-390 in Brighton but also extended northward along the Sea Breeze Expressway to NY 104 in Irondequoit. The rest of the loop south of I-490, meanwhile, would become part of an extended I-390. NY 47, the then-current designation for much of the Outer Loop, would be eliminated entirely. Most of the plans went into effect when the NY 47 designation was eliminated on March 18, 1980. The southern half of the Outer Loop was signed as planned; however, I-390 and I-590 were modified to end at their junctions with I-490. The section of I-590 from Winton Road to I-390‚Äîas well as the interchange connecting the two‚Äîwas completed . In 2012, a diverging diamond interchange was added at the intersection of I-590 and Winton Road in the Brighton suburb of Rochester.

Its ambition was cut successively back, and it only constructed from Stratford, London to Bishop's Stortford and Hertford. It was always short of money, and it got access to London over the Eastern Counties Railway. It was built at the track gauge of five feet, but it converted to standard gauge in 1844. Its main line opened progressively from 1840 to 1842. It was worked by the neighbouring Eastern Counties Railway, and it leased its network to that company in from the beginning of 1844 for 999 years. From that time it was a financial company only, it amalgamated with the Great Eastern Railway in 1902. The entire network is still in use and electrified, and part of the original main line now forms a section of the main line between London (Liverpool Street) and Cambridge. Proposals The Northern and Eastern Railway network at the end of 1843When the Stockton and Darlington Railway was opened in 1825, great enthusiasm for railway transport was generated. A number of schemes were put forward for connecting London and York, and some of these were planned to pass through Cambridge. A canal engineer, Nicholas Wilcox Cundy, surveyed such a line, to be known as the Grand Northern & Eastern Railway, in 1834, and the following year another survey was made, by Joseph Gibbs, for another line from London through Cambridge to York. This scheme went to Parliament in the 1836 session as a proposed \\"Great Northern Railway\\", nothing to do with the subsequent Great Northern Railway a decade later. The 1836 proposal was rejected by Parliament.Cecil J Allen, The Great Eastern Railway, Ian Allan, Shepperton, fifth edition 1968 Meanwhile, a public meeting was held at Cambridge Town Hall on 23 January 1836, at which it was decided to support a route surveyed by James Walker. A Bill for a Northern & Eastern Railway was prepared; it was to run from London to Cambridge, with a branch from a little south of Cambridge to Newmarket, Norwich and Yarmouth. The extension from Cambridge to Lincoln was not included, as the surveys had not been completed. The Bill was passed, but the route was cut back to run from London to Cambridge only; it received the Royal Assent on 4 July 1836. Authorised share capital was ¬£1,200,000.Lake, G H (1945 reprinted 1999). The Railways of Tottenham. Teignmouth: Peter Kay. page 12. * Although the construction cost was large, the Company was confident of a 16% return.Gordon, D I, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain ‚Äî Volume 5: The Eastern Counties, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1977, The London terminus, and track gauge The Northern and Eastern Railway was to have its London terminus at Islington. The topography was such that this would have required tunnelling to reach it, and it was realised that this was an expensive proposition. An approach was made to the Commercial Railway (later the London and Blackwall Railway) with a view to using its final approach to London. This was unsuccessful, so the Eastern Counties Railway was contacted, with a view to using the ECR Shoreditch terminus. This was agreed to, and Parliament ratified the arrangement, so the Northern and Eastern Railway's planned line was rerouted from Tottenham to join the ECR at Stratford. The rental for this arrangement was to be ¬£7,000 a year, with an additional charge per passenger. The ECR agreed to build a separate terminus at Shoreditch for the N&ER.; When the Eastern Counties Railway determined on its track gauge of 5 feet, the Northern and Eastern had to adopt the same gauge in order to use the approach tracks. The first section of the Eastern Counties Railway was opened on 18 June 1839, from a temporary terminus at Mile End to another temporary terminus at Romford. Contract award, and a retrenchment of scope At the end of 1837 a contract for construction of the line was awarded to David Macintosh. In March 1838 construction began, with Michael Borthwick as resident engineer. From the beginning, the N&ER; was unable to raise the capital it needed for building its line. By May 1837 the contractor was in difficulties, and Robert Stephenson was appointed as Engineer in Chief, with Borthwick continuing as resident engineer. George Parker Bidder was appointed as the new contractor. Engineering contractors Grissell and Peto were approached late in 1837 about building the line as far as Bishop's Stortford. In March 1840 they started work between Stratford and Tottenham, and finally took over the work between Tottenham and Broxbourne from David McIntosh. The Company obtained a further Act, which received the Royal Assent on 4 June 1840; the line from Bishop's Stortford to Cambridge was abandoned, and the share capital was reduced to ¬£720,000. Opening On 15 September 1840 the N&ER; started operation between Stratford (ECR) and Broxbourne, a distance of about 15 miles. At first this was a single line; it was doubled in 1841. Trains ran through from Shoreditch; the ECR insisted that Shoreditch to Stratford journeys were exclusive to them. The line was extended as far as Harlow on 9 August 1841; to Spelbrook (a temporary terminus) on 19 November 1841; and as far as Bishop's Stortford on 16 May 1842. A criticism of the route of the N&ER; was that the line followed the valley of the River Lea, while nearly all of the settlements were on higher ground, and were some distance from the stations. Tottenham was used as the railhead for cattle being brought in to London; they walked from there to the London markets. In the second half of 1842 a dividend of 2% was paid. Hertford branch In June 1841 parliamentary assent was given for a branch from Broxbourne to Hertford; it became the present-day Hertford East Branch Line. Work on the Hertford branch line began early in 1843, and it opened as a single line on 31 October 1843. It was doubled in October 1846 (after the lease by the ECR). Hockerill The northernmost extent of the line was at Bishop's Stortford, opened before the end of 1843, when the Northern and Eastern Railway ceased to control its own network. However a special arrangement was made to receive excursion trains at Hockerill, a half mile or so north of Bishop's Stortford station. The overbridge at that point today carries Hockerill Street, and Bishop's Stortford was then a much smaller community; Hockerill was a distinct place. (The later Hockerill station on the Dunmow branch was built later: 1869.) An advertisement in the Times newspaper read: > Newmarket Houghton Meeting--A special train, consisting of first-class > carriages only, of the Northern and Eastern Railway, stopping only at > Tottenham and Broxbourne, will leave the London Terminus, Shoreditch, for > Hockerill, Bishop's Stortford, on Monday, 23d inst., at half-past-seven > a.m., and return from Hockerill at half-past nine o'clock at night, thereby > enabling persons attending Newmarket to see the whole of the races and > return to London the same evening.

The ECR was to pay the N&ER; 5 per cent annually on the ¬£970,000 capital cost of building the line, and profits would be apportioned. The N&ER; continued as an independent company, receiving the lease charges but not operating any railway; in fact it merged into the Great Eastern Railway in 1902. Gauge change At the same time as the discussion about the lease took place, the two companies agreed that their track gauge of 5 feet was a hindrance, and they decided to alter it to the standard gauge of 4 ft in. The physical conversion was undertaken between 5 September 1844 and 7 October; it was achieved without interruption to the running of trains, except on the Hertford branch. Engineering details Whishaw reported that the rails are \\"of the double parallel form\\" (that is, not fish-bellied and broadly similar to modern bullhead rail) in 12 and 15 feet lengths. \\"The upper and lower webs are not of similar section\\": Whishaw meant that the head and foot are not identical. The sleepers were of larch, 9 feet in length, and 10 inches by 5 inches in cross section. The ballasting was of gravel, of at least 2 feet in thickness throughout. From 1844 Broxbourne station in 1960 From the first day of 1844, the Northern and Eastern Railway was simply a financial shell company, receiving lease charges from the Eastern Counties Railway but not operating any railway. The N&ER; network extended from Stratford to Bishop's Stortford and from Broxbourne to Hertford, and it became the stem of the important main line to Cambridge, finished by the Eastern Counties Railway. The approach to London was later altered to run through Hackney Downs, but the Stratford to Copper Mill Junction (Tottenham Hale) section was retained, and became a key link for goods traffic approaching Temple Mills Yard. In 1849 the Eastern Counties Railway opened a branch line from Angel Road to Enfield. The Eastern Counties Railway and certain other companies in East Anglia amalgamated to form the Great Eastern Railway in 1862. The GER adopted a policy of running frequent passenger services on the London suburban lines: in 1864 there were 29 departures for the Broxbourne line. Shoreditch station had been renamed Bishopsgate, but it was obviously inadequate for the Romford line traffic and the Broxbourne line, and the decision was taken to extend westwards: Liverpool Street station was opened in 1871. In 1872 a new shorter route towards Broxbourne was opened, from Bethnal Green, near Liverpool Street, via Hackney Downs to Copper Mill Junction, near Tottenham (Hale) station. In time this became the dominant route from London. In 1891 the Churchbury Loop was opened, from Bury Street Junction, to Cheshunt. The area was undeveloped and the sparse train service failed to encourage residential travel. It closed to ordinary passenger trains in 1909. The N&ER; line never became the primary route from London to York, but the Great Eastern Railway eventually (from 1882) participated in a joint railway, the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway, which gave it access to Doncaster, and by means of running powers to York. A significant flow of coal ran south from Yorkshire to London, and for a while an express passenger train, the Cathedrals Express, ran over the route. The cathedrals were Ely, Peterborough and Lincoln, and the service ran from 1892 to 1918.Goode, C.T. The Great Northern & Great Eastern Joint Railway, published by C T Goode, Anlaby, 1892, The twentieth century The passenger use of the line intensified in the twentieth century, particularly for residential travel as people became accustomed to travelling longer distances in order to live in more rural surroundings. Cambridge too became increasingly significant as a regional centre, attracting express passenger trains over the route. Goods and mineral traffic too remained dominant, although declining steeply after 1955. Organisationally the Northern and Eastern Railway Company was absorbed into the Great Eastern Railway in 1902; the GER was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 (as part of the \\"grouping\\" of the railways) and in 1948 the LNER in turn was nationalised. The Churchbury Loop from Bury Street Junction, near Enfield, and Cheshunt, had been dormant so far as passenger use was concerned, since 1909. In 1960 it was electrified and reopened as part of a new electrified suburban network; the line was retitled the Southbury Loop. At first six trains an hour were run, although this was later reduced. The new suburban electric trains ran as far as Bishop's Stortford and Hertford. For the time being the southern part of the N&ER; route remained unelectrified, but electrification was provided from May 1969.J C Gillham, The Age of the Electric Trains, Ian Allan Ltd, Shepperton, 1988, The entire network remains in use at the present day. The dominant traffic is on the section between Copper Mill Junction and Bishop's Stortford, part of the route from London Liverpool Street station to Cambridge and Stansted Airport.

Stratford Junction in 1851Whishaw reported that \\"At Shoreditch this Company is accommodated with part of the Eastern Counties station. The intermediate stations already opened to the public are at the Lea Bridge Road, Tottenham, Edmonton, Enfield-Highway and Ponder‚Äôs End, Waltham Cross, and Broxbourne. In fact the two parts of Stratford station were to the east of the point of junction; the present day platforms 1 and 2 are on the site of the original N&ER; station. The station was approached by Station Road, connecting to Angel Lane. The present-day main entrance in Gibbins Road came much later. Locomotives The company purchased 14 2-2-2 locomotives from four builders: * Robert Stephenson and Company * Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy * R. B. Longridge and Company (of Bedlington, Northumberland) * Charles Tayleur and Co (later Vulcan Foundry)Allen, page 85 The locomotives were re-gauged to standard gauge in September and October 1844.Allen, page 12 Whishaw said that \\"The principal engine-station is near the Stratford junction.\\" Carriages Carriages were long and wide. They had six wheels and were first, second or third class with capacity for 24, 32 and 60 to 70 passengers respectively. They had footboards to allow passengers to board at locations with no or low platforms. The third class carriages were open to the elements. Whishaw had a comment about the carriages: \\"The carriages on this line present a novelty in being mounted on six instead of four wheels, except those of the Great Western and Blackwall lines. One of the advantages of this mode of construction is, that the carriages are less likely to run off the line, or to give way by reason of an axle breaking on the journey.\\" See also * Eastern Counties Railway * Great Eastern Railway References Category:Early British railway companies Category:History of rail transport in London Category:Pre-grouping British railway companies Category:Railway companies established in 1836 Category:Railway lines opened in 1840 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1902 Category:Transport in the London Borough of Enfield Category:Transport in the London Borough of Hackney Category:Transport in the London Borough of Haringey Category:Transport in the London Borough of Newham Category:Transport in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:5 ft gauge railways in the United Kingdom Category:Standard gauge railways in England Category:1836 establishments in England ","title":"Northern and Eastern Railway"},{"id":"892423","text":"Wckr Spgt is an American musical band, that formed in 1981 in Claremont, California.

London Buses is the subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL) that manages bus services within Greater London. It was formed following the Greater London Authority Act 1999 that transferred control of bus services in Greater London and its surrounding areas from the UK Government's London Regional Transport (LRT) to TfL, controlled by the locally elected Mayor of London. Overview Transport for London's key areas of direct responsibility through London Buses are the following: * planning new bus routes * revising existing bus routes * specifying service levels * monitoring service quality * management of bus stations and bus stops * assistance in 'on ground' set up of diversions, bus driver assistance in situations over and above job requirements, for example Road Accidents * providing information for passengers in the form of timetables and maps at bus stops and online, and an online route planning service * producing leaflet maps, available from Travel Information Centres, libraries etc., and as online downloads. * operating CentreComm London Buses' 24‚Äëhour command-and-control centre based in Southwark =Bus operations= All bus operations are undertaken under a tendering system in which operators bid for routes in return for a set price per route operated. Contracts are normally for five years, with two-year extensions available if performance criteria are met. Routes are set up, controlled and tendered out by Transport for London (TfL) and they provide day to day assistance via CentreComm which coordinates a large scale network of Network Traffic Controllers to help with any traffic issues that may occur. Operators provide staff to drive the buses, provide the buses to operate and also adhere to set TfL guidelines. Operators are then in return paid per mile that each bus runs, the pricing is announced on new tenders. =Publications= London Buses publishes a variety of bus maps. Some are traditional street maps of London marked with bus numbers. In 2002, TfL introduced the first \\"spider\\" maps. Rather than attempting to cover the entire city, these maps are centred on a particular locality or bus station, and convey the route information in the schematic style of Harry Beck's influential Tube map, capitalising on TfL's iconic style of information design. The arachnoid form of bus routes radiating from a centre earned them the nickname \\"spider\\" maps, although TfL refer to them on their website as route maps. The maps are displayed at most major bus stops, and can be downloaded in PDF format via the Internet from the TfL website. Legal status The legal identity of London Buses is London Bus Services Limited (LBSL),Companies House extract company no 3914787 London Bus Services Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London. East Thames Buses was the trading name of another wholly owned subsidiary of TfL called, rather confusingly, London Buses Limited (LBL).Companies House extract company no 1900906 London Buses Limited LBL was formed on 1 April 1985 as part of the privatisation of London bus services, and acted as an arm's-length subsidiary of TfL's precursor organisation, London Regional Transport (LRT), holding twelve bus operating units (from late 1988) and other assets. The operating units were sold off in 1994/95, and their purchasers make up the majority of companies awarded bus operating tenders from the current London Buses (LBSL). After 1994/95, the LBL company lay dormant, passing from LRT to TfL. It was resurrected when East Thames Buses was formed, separated by a \\"Chinese wall\\" from LBSL, and acted as a London bus operator by proxy. Scope The local bus network in London is one of the largest and most comprehensive in the world. Over 8000 scheduled buses operate on over 700 different routes. Over the year this network carries over 1.8 billion passenger journeys. Fares and concessions Buses in the London Buses network accept Travelcards, Oyster card products (including bus passes and Oyster pay as you go) and contactless debit and credit cards. Cash fares have not been available since 6 July 2014, but Day Bus passes (issued either as a single use Oyster card, or on paper from station ticket machines) were re-introduced on 2 January 2015.MD1418 January 2015 Fare Changes Greater London Authority 18 November 2014 Single journey fares used to be charged in relation to length of journey (fare stages), but are now charged as single flat fares for any length of journey. From 2000, the flat fare was higher for journeys in Zone 1 than in outer zones, although from 2004 this difference was eliminated, the change coinciding with the introduction of Oyster card flat fares. , the single fare is ¬£1.50. With Oyster pay as you go, users are charged a set amount for single journeys, although there is a \\"daily cap\\", which limits the maximum amount of money that will be deducted from the balance, regardless of how many buses are taken that day (from 04.30 to 04.29 the next day). Alternatively, weekly and monthly passes may also be purchased and loaded onto an Oyster card. Passengers using contactless payment cards are charged the same fares as on Oyster pay as you go. Unlike Oyster cards, contactless cards also have a 7-day fare cap though it currently only operates on a Monday-Sunday basis.Leaflet 'Contactless travel' published by TfL. Under 11s can travel free on London buses and trams at any time unaccompanied by an adult; they do not need an Oyster card or a ticket. Children aged 11 to 15 travel free on buses with an 11‚Äì15 Oyster photocard; without an Oyster card or Travelcard, they have to pay the full adult fare. Visitors can have a special discount added to an ordinary Oyster card at TfL's Travel Information Centres. There are also concessions for London residents aged 16 to 18. The Freedom Pass scheme allows Greater London residents over state pension age, and those with a disability, to travel free at any time on buses and TfL's rail services. People who have concessionary bus passes issued by English local authorities travel free on TfL bus services at any time. Operators Bus services in London are operated by Abellio London, Arriva London, CT Plus, Go-Ahead London, London Sovereign RATP, London United, Metroline, Quality Line, Stagecoach London, Sullivan Buses, Tower Transit and Uno. Each company has its own operating code, and every bus garage in London has its own garage code. Vehicles New and old: A 2005 Alexander ALX400 model overtakes a 1959 AEC Routemaster An elevated view of London's first HyFLEET:CUTE hydrogen fuel cell bus, showing the six roof mounted hydrogen fuel tanks, looking down from the high level concourse at Tower Gateway Docklands Light Railway station. The various bus operators providing services under contract to London Buses operate a wide variety of vehicles, about the only immediately obvious common feature being their use of a largely red livery. However, London Buses in fact maintains a close control over both the age and specification of the vehicles. Particular examples of this include the use of separate exit doors, increasingly unusual on buses in the United Kingdom outside London, and, on double-deckers, the use of a straight staircase where most other UK operators specify a more compact curved staircase. Additionally, London Buses also specifies that vehicles operating in London use traditional printed roller destination blinds, whereas in most other parts of the country, electronic dot matrix or LED displays are the norm on new buses. iBus All of London's buses use the London iBus system, an Automatic Vehicle Location system that provides passengers with audio visual announcements and is able to trigger priority at traffic junctions. The system was on trial in 2006, and was extended to all bus routes by 2009.

These minimization problems arise especially in least squares curve fitting. The LMA is used in many software applications for solving generic curve-fitting problems. However, as with many fitting algorithms, the LMA finds only a local minimum, which is not necessarily the global minimum. The LMA interpolates between the Gauss‚ÄìNewton algorithm (GNA) and the method of gradient descent. The LMA is more robust than the GNA, which means that in many cases it finds a solution even if it starts very far off the final minimum. For well-behaved functions and reasonable starting parameters, the LMA tends to be a bit slower than the GNA. LMA can also be viewed as Gauss‚ÄìNewton using a trust region approach. The algorithm was first published in 1944 by Kenneth Levenberg, while working at the Frankford Army Arsenal. It was rediscovered in 1963 by Donald Marquardt, who worked as a statistician at DuPont, and independently by Girard, Wynne and Morrison.  The problem  The primary application of the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm is in the least-squares curve fitting problem: given a set of m empirical pairs \\\\left (x_i, y_i\\\\right ) of independent and dependent variables, find the parameters of the model curve f\\\\left (x, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) so that the sum of the squares of the deviations S\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) is minimized: :\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta} \\\\in \\\\operatorname{argmin}\\\\limits_{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta} S\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{argmin}\\\\limits_{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta} \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\left [y_i - f\\\\left (x_i, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ]^2, which is assumed to be non-empty.  The solution  Like other numeric minimization algorithms, the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm is an iterative procedure. To start a minimization, the user has to provide an initial guess for the parameter vector . In cases with only one minimum, an uninformed standard guess like \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^\\\\text{T} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}1,\\\\ 1,\\\\ \\\\dots,\\\\ 1\\\\end{pmatrix} will work fine; in cases with multiple minima, the algorithm converges to the global minimum only if the initial guess is already somewhat close to the final solution. In each iteration step, the parameter vector is replaced by a new estimate . To determine , the function f\\\\left (x_i, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\right ) is approximated by its linearization: : f\\\\left (x_i, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\right ) \\\\approx f\\\\left (x _i, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) + \\\\mathbf J_i \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta, where : \\\\mathbf J_i = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f\\\\left (x_i, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta} is the gradient (row-vector in this case) of with respect to . The sum S\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) of square deviations has its minimum at a zero gradient with respect to . The above first-order approximation of f\\\\left (x_i, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\right ) gives : S\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\right ) \\\\approx \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\left [y_i - f\\\\left (x_i, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) - \\\\mathbf J_i \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\right ]^2, or in vector notation, : \\\\begin{align} S\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\right ) &\\\\approx \\\\left \\\\\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) - \\\\mathbf J\\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\right \\\\^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) - \\\\mathbf J\\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta \\\\right ]^{\\\\mathrm T}\\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) - \\\\mathbf J\\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\right ]\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ]^{\\\\mathrm T}\\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ] - \\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ]^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta - \\\\left (\\\\mathbf J \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\right )^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ] + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ]^{\\\\mathrm T}\\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ] - 2\\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ]^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J\\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta. \\\\end{align} Taking the derivative of S\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta\\\\right ) with respect to and setting the result to zero gives :\\\\left (\\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J\\\\right )\\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta = \\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T}\\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ], where \\\\mathbf J is the Jacobian matrix, whose -th row equals \\\\mathbf J_i, and where \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) and \\\\mathbf y are vectors with -th component f\\\\left (x_i, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) and y_i respectively. The above expression obtained for comes under the Gauss-Newton method. The Jacobian matrix as defined above is not (in general) a square matrix, but a rectangular matrix of size m \\\\times n, where n is the number of parameters (size of the vector \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta). The matrix multiplication \\\\left (\\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J\\\\right) yields the required n \\\\times n square matrix and the matrix- vector product on the right hand side yields a vector of size n. The result is a set of n linear equations, which can be solved for . Levenberg's contribution is to replace this equation by a \\"damped version\\": :\\\\left (\\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J + \\\\lambda\\\\mathbf I\\\\right ) \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta = \\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T}\\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right], where is the identity matrix, giving as the increment to the estimated parameter vector . The (non-negative) damping factor is adjusted at each iteration. If reduction of is rapid, a smaller value can be used, bringing the algorithm closer to the Gauss‚ÄìNewton algorithm, whereas if an iteration gives insufficient reduction in the residual, can be increased, giving a step closer to the gradient-descent direction. Note that the gradient of with respect to equals -2\\\\left (\\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T}\\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ]\\\\right )^{\\\\mathrm T}. Therefore, for large values of , the step will be taken approximately in the direction opposite to the gradient. If either the length of the calculated step or the reduction of sum of squares from the latest parameter vector fall below predefined limits, iteration stops, and the last parameter vector is considered to be the solution. Levenberg's algorithm has the disadvantage that if the value of damping factor is large, inverting is not used at all. Fletcher provided the insight that we can scale each component of the gradient according to the curvature, so that there is larger movement along the directions where the gradient is smaller. This avoids slow convergence in the direction of small gradient. Therefore, Fletcher in his 1971 paper A modified Marquardt subroutine for non-linear least squares replaced the identity matrix with the diagonal matrix consisting of the diagonal elements of , thus making the solution scale invariant: :\\\\left [\\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J + \\\\lambda \\\\operatorname{diag}\\\\left (\\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T} \\\\mathbf J\\\\right )\\\\right ] \\\\boldsymbol\\\\delta = \\\\mathbf J^{\\\\mathrm T}\\\\left [\\\\mathbf y - \\\\mathbf f\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right )\\\\right ]. A similar damping factor appears in Tikhonov regularization, which is used to solve linear ill-posed problems, as well as in ridge regression, an estimation technique in statistics. = Choice of damping parameter = Various more or less heuristic arguments have been put forward for the best choice for the damping parameter . Theoretical arguments exist showing why some of these choices guarantee local convergence of the algorithm; however, these choices can make the global convergence of the algorithm suffer from the undesirable properties of steepest descent, in particular, very slow convergence close to the optimum. The absolute values of any choice depend on how well-scaled the initial problem is. Marquardt recommended starting with a value and a factor . Initially setting \\\\lambda = \\\\lambda_0 and computing the residual sum of squares S\\\\left (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\right ) after one step from the starting point with the damping factor of \\\\lambda = \\\\lambda_0 and secondly with . If both of these are worse than the initial point, then the damping is increased by successive multiplication by until a better point is found with a new damping factor of for some . If use of the damping factor results in a reduction in squared residual, then this is taken as the new value of (and the new optimum location is taken as that obtained with this damping factor) and the process continues; if using resulted in a worse residual, but using resulted in a better residual, then is left unchanged and the new optimum is taken as the value obtained with as damping factor. An effective strategy for the control of the damping parameter, called delayed gratification, consists of increasing the parameter by a small amount for each uphill step, and decreasing by a large amount for each downhill step. The idea behind this strategy is to avoid moving downhill too fast in the beginning of optimization, therefore restricting the steps available in future iterations and therefore slowing down convergence. An increase by a factor of 2 and a decrease by a factor of 3 has been shown to be effective in most cases, while for large problems more extreme values can work better, with an increase by a factor of 1.5 and a decrease by a factor of 5. = Geodesic acceleration = When interpreting the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt step as the velocity \\\\boldsymbol{v}_k along a geodesic path in the parameter space, it is possible to improve the method by adding a second order term that accounts for the acceleration \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k along the geodesic : \\\\boldsymbol{v}_k + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k where \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k is the solution of : \\\\boldsymbol{J}_k \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k = -f_{vv} . Since this geodesic acceleration term depends only on the directional derivative f_{vv} = \\\\sum_{\\\\mu u} v_{\\\\mu} v_{ u} \\\\partial_{\\\\mu} \\\\partial_{ u} f (\\\\boldsymbol{x}) along the direction of the velocity \\\\boldsymbol{v}, it does not require computing the full second order derivative matrix, requiring only a small overhead in terms of computing cost. Since the second order derivative can be a fairly complex expression, it can be convenient to replace it with a finite difference approximation : \\\\begin{align} f_{vv}^i &\\\\approx \\\\frac{f_i(\\\\boldsymbol{x} + h \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}) - 2 f_i(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) + f_i(\\\\boldsymbol{x} - h \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta})}{h^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{2}{h} \\\\left( \\\\frac{f_i(\\\\boldsymbol{x} + h \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}) - f_i(\\\\boldsymbol{x})}{h} - \\\\boldsymbol{J}_i \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta} \\\\right) \\\\end{align} where f(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) and \\\\boldsymbol{J} have already been computed by the algorithm, therefore requiring only one additional function evaluation to compute f(\\\\boldsymbol{x} + h \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}). The choice of the finite difference step h can affect the stability of the algorithm, and a value of around 0.1 is usually reasonable in general. Since the acceleration may point in opposite direction to the velocity, to prevent it to stall the method in case the damping is too small, an additional criterion on the acceleration is added in order to accept a step, requiring that : \\\\frac{2 \\\\left\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k \\\\right\\\\}{\\\\left\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{v}_k \\\\right\\\\} \\\\le \\\\alpha where \\\\alpha is usually fixed to a value lesser than 1, with smaller values for harder problems. The addition of a geodesic acceleration term can allow significant increase in convergence speed and it is especially useful when the algorithm is moving through narrow canyons in the landscape of the objective function, where the allowed steps are smaller and the higher accuracy due to the second order term gives significative improvements. Example Poor fit Better fit Best fit In this example we try to fit the function y = a \\\\cos\\\\left (bX\\\\right ) + b \\\\sin\\\\left (aX\\\\right ) using the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm implemented in GNU Octave as the leasqr function.

Only when the parameters in the last graph are chosen closest to the original, are the curves fitting exactly. This equation is an example of very sensitive initial conditions for the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm.

Philip Simmons (June 9, 1912 ‚Äì June 22, 2009) was an American artisan and blacksmith specializing in the craft of ironwork. Simmons spent 78 years as a blacksmith, focusing on decorative iron work. When he began his career, blacksmiths in Charleston made practical, everyday household objects, such as horseshoes. By the time he retired 77 years later, the craft was considered an art form rather than a practical profession. Examples of Simmons' work, including iron gates, can be seen throughout the city of Charleston, South Carolina, as well as the rest of South Carolina Lowcountry. His pieces are displayed at the Smithsonian Museum, South Carolina State Museum, Paris, France, and China. Biography Philip Simmons was born on June 9, 1912, in Daniel Island, South Carolina. He was raised by his grandparents, before being sent to Charleston in 1920 to live with his mother when he was 8 years old. Simmons resided on Vernon Street and enrolled in school at the Buist Elementary School, which is now known as the Buist Academy. Later in his life, Simmons would design and create the iron arch which now stands over the school's entry gate. Simmons became interested in the craftspeople who lived in his neighborhood, and soon began visiting various workshops near his home. In particular, Simmons became interested in a smithy on Charlotte Street run by Peter Simmons, who was not related to Philip. Philip Simmons soon quit school and began an apprenticeship with Peter Simmons, a former slave, when he was 13 years old. He became a full blacksmith when he was 18 years old, after a five-year apprenticeship. Simmons began working with ornamental and decorative ironwork in 1938 at his own blacksmith shop. In the early 1940s, Simmons began working with a Charleston businessman named Jack Krawcheck. Krawcheck commissioned a wrought iron gate for the rear of his store, which was located on King Street. However, Simmons had to create the gate out of scrap iron because the demand for iron during World War II made it impossible to acquire new iron. This was the first iron gate that Simmons ever crafted and delivered to a customer. The Krawcheck family would ultimately acquire more than 30 iron pieces from Simmons during his career. Though he had begun working on ornamental ironwork in 1938, the Krawcheck gate marked a turning point in Simmons' career as an iron artisan. Over the course of his seven decades long career, Simmons created over 500 separate pieces, including iron balconies, window grilles, fences and gates. For example, Simmons forged and designed five iron gates along Stolls Alley in Charleston alone. In 1976, he created a \\"star and fish gate\\" for the Smithsonian Institution, which was designed to look like the fish was swimming. Simmons also created smaller, metal objects to supplement his income, including tools, shutter dog and fireplace pokers. In 1970, Simmons created a cup holder for a Volvo, which was crafted from a coat hanger. Most of his work was created at his workshop at his home on Blake Street. =Recognition= John Michael Vlach, an author and professor of American studies at George Washington University, penned a biography of Simmons and his work in a 1981 book entitled Charleston Blacksmith: The Work of Philips Simmons. The book was re-released as a second, updated edition eleven years later. In a separate essay called, \\"The Buildings of Charleston,\\" Vlach later wrote of Simmons' career, \\"At the outset of his career he took orders; now he gives them...In the midst of his time-bound trade and even while preserving the historic appearance of Charleston, he remains his own man. He has found self-expression in the communal tradition.\\" The National Endowment for the Arts bestowed Simmons with a National Heritage Fellowship in 1982. During his acceptance speech at the ceremony, which Simmons gave following a performance by a blues group, Simmons remarked, \\"My instrument is an anvil. I guess some of you have heard me play ... a tune on the anvil, the old blacksmith tune. ... I'm proud of that anvil, really proud. ... That anvil fed me when I was hungry and that anvil clothed me when I was naked. That anvil put shoes on my feet.\\" Although he officially retired at age 75, Simmons continued to teach his craft to younger artisans late into his life. In 1991, the Vestry of his church, St. John's Reformed Episcopal Church, formed the Philip Simmons Foundation, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization to develop and maintain a commemorative garden on the grounds of the church as a tribute to the man and his work. The church and garden is located at 91 Anson Street in downtown Charleston, South Carolina. A documentary on Simmon's life titled Keeper of The Gate won the 1995 Southeastern Regional Emmy Award in the category of Cultural Documentary. It was written and directed by David Flander. Simmons and Flander struck a friendship during filming and remained friends. They would go to local Charleston sporting events together. In 2006, Simmons received an honorary doctorate from South Carolina State University for his contributions to the field of metalworking. Awards Simmons was a recipient of a 1982 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. That year's fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA. On January 31, 1994, he was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame. South Carolina Governor David Beasley bestowed the Order of the Palmetto, the state's highest honor, on Simmons in 1998. He was later awarded the Elizabeth O'Neill Verner Governor's Award for \\"Lifetime Achievement in the Arts\\" in May 2001. He was also honored by the South Carolina Legislature for his work. =List of awards= *1982, National Endowment for the Arts, National Heritage Fellowship *1982, Lifetime Achievement Award, South Carolina General Assembly for \\"lifetime achievement\\" and commissions for public sculptures by the South Carolina State Museum and the city of Charleston *1994, South Carolina Hall of Fame, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina *1998, Order of the Palmetto, the highest civilian award given in South Carolina, by Governor David Beasley *2001, Elizabeth O'Neill Verner Governor's Award for \\"Lifetime Achievement in the Arts\\" Later life Simmons moved from his home to the Bishop Gadsden Retirement Community in Charleston in the spring of 2008.

On the National Rail network it is on the West Anglia Main Line, from London Liverpool Street, and is served by Greater Anglia and Stansted Express. On the Underground it is on the Victoria line between and . The station is in Travelcard Zone 3. The station was opened in 1840, with Underground services added in 1968. A new station building is under construction, and an additional platform is being added as part of a regeneration scheme. History =19th century= Locations served by Tottenham Hale trains in previous years included London St Pancras (via the Tottenham and Hampstead Joint Railway), North Woolwich via the low level platforms at (after the Palace Gates Line service was cut back) and York (via Cambridge and the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway).Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 122 page 22 Rodger Green April 2005 Until recently, the next station served to the south on the line to was , but only a small number of trains to and from Tottenham Hale served Clapton. Clapton is now exclusively served by trains on the branch instead, except for the last train to on Mondays to Fridays, which stops at Clapton before Tottenham Hale.Abellio Greater Anglia West Anglia train timetables 18 May 2014 pages 6 & 31. The station opened on 15 September 1840 as Tottenham, on the Northern & Eastern Railway (N&ER;) line from Stratford in east London to in Hertfordshire. The Northern and Eastern Railway was leased by the Eastern Counties Railway in 1844 who took over operation of the line. The line was initially laid to a gauge of ; however, this had already been identified as non-standard, and between 5 September and 7 October 1844 the whole network was re-laid to . On 12 September 1858 a passenger train collided with some goods wagons that had been shunted onto the main line. Nobody was seriously injured. Eighteen months later on 20 February 1860 the station was the site of a serious railway accident when a locomotive derailed, killing the driver, fireman and seven passengers. The Eastern Counties Railway was taken over by the Great Eastern Railway in 1862. Until 1868 Tottenham Hale was a railhead for cattle traffic from East Anglia. Trains were unloaded there, and the cattle driven miles down what is now the A10 road towards London.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 122 pages 26 Rodger Green April 2005 In 1868 the link (since removed) to the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway was opened and the cattle traffic transferred to Tufnell Park, which was closer to the site of the cattle market off Caledonian Road. Four years later in 1872 the route via Clapton was opened, offering a slightly more direct route to Liverpool Street.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 122 pages 20-27 Rodger Green April 2005 In 1875, the suffix 'Hale' was added to the station's name; this was removed in November 1938, before being restored in 1968.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 122 pages 24 Rodger Green April 2005 In 1882 the line through Tottenham Hale became part of a major rail freight artery, with the opening of the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway. This provided a link for the Great Eastern from the coalfields in the north to London. This led to a second pair of running lines known as the Slow Lines being added in 1913. The slow lines that exist today were previously known as the fast lines. =20th century= On 29 August 1913 a northbound mail train (carrying passengers) ran into the back of a freight train just south of the station at Tottenham South Junction. The cause was a signal passed at danger in foggy conditions. Two passengers were badly injured, 16 less so. The area was always susceptible to flooding, one of the worst instances being between 18 and 22 February 1919 when the River Lea overflowed its banks and rail traffic was suspended. In 1919 there were, as well as the two sets of main lines, some private sidings serving local industries. Other sidings in the area were used to clean passenger rolling stock when not in service. In 1923 operation passed to the London & North Eastern Railway, and following nationalisation in 1948 the station became part of British Railways Eastern Region. On 12 February 1927 an express passenger train was in collision with a lorry on a level crossing. Owing to foggy conditions, the train was not travelling at high speed. On 4 October 1929 another accident occurred at Tottenham North Junction (just south of the station) when a goods train passed a signal at danger and was hit by a passenger train. There were no fatalities. On 21 March 1944 (during World War Two) a number of incendiary bombs fell close to the station, destroying a lineside hut. In 1961 the link from Tottenham South Junction to the Tottenham and Hampstead Line was closed.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 122 pages 24-27 Rodger Green April 2005 On 14 July 1967 planning permission was granted for the addition of the London Underground Victoria line station. The station was renamed Tottenham Hale on 1 September 1968, when it became an interchange station with London Underground on the opening of the first stage of the Victoria line. The Lea Valley line between Copper Mill Junction and Cheshunt was electrified at 25 kV in 1969. Many of the private goods sidings were removed at this time.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 122 pages 25 Rodger Green April 2005 Prior to electrification, between 1958 and 1969 passenger services between Cheshunt and London Liverpool Street through Tottenham Hale were normally operated by Class 125 diesel multiple units (which had been purpose-built for the line). When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Railways. In the late 1990s, at the same time as the Stansted Express service to Stansted Airport was started, the British Rail station at Tottenham Hale was totally rebuilt; the Underground station was revamped at the same time. None of the original Victorian station now exists. With the privatisation of the UK's railways in 1994 operation of the station was initially allocated to a business unit which succeeded the old British Railways structure before being taken over by West Anglia Great Northern (WAGN) in January 1997. =21st century= Tottenham Hale station in 2007 Redevelopment work at the station in 2014 Initially owned by Prism Rail, National Express took over operation in July 2000. In 1994 responsibility for the operational infrastructure passed to Railtrack. In August 2002 signalling control was transferred to the Liverpool Street Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC).Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 135 page 14 Chris Cook(photo caption) July 2008 The WAGN franchise was replaced in 2004 by One, this was renamed National Express East Anglia. The following year, following financial difficulties, Railtrack was superseded by Network Rail. From 11 December 2005, a new service to and from Stratford reintroduced a direct passenger connection between Tottenham Hale and Stratford via the mainly freight line across Walthamstow Marshes. For many years the only service on this route had been a parliamentary \\"ghost train\\" to Enfield Town via Stratford operated to save lengthy closure (to passenger) procedures. In February 2012 operation of the station changed once again, with Greater Anglia taking over the franchise.  Tottenham Hale bus station  Tottenham Hale bus station is located beside the railway station. Following the 2011 England riots which began in Tottenham, a redevelopment of the tube, bus and rail stations was used to encourage investment in the area. The ¬£110 million bus and rail interchange project for Tottenham Hale was completed in 2014. As part of the project the bus station was roofed with ETFE, which is also used in the Eden Project. The bus station roof was a finalist for Best Urban Design in the 2018 Haringey Design Awards 2018, and a National Finalist in the Structural Steel Design Awards in 2015. = Buses = The following bus routes serve the bus station London Buses route 41, 76, 123, 192, 230, W4, N41 and N73.

Specifically, the proposed Tottenham Hale Station Upgrade development comprises the following elements: * creating a new landmark entrance to the Station; * increasing the capacity of the Station concourse, by doubling the size of the current ticket hall; * improving interchange by relocating the Greater Anglia and London Underground gatelines; * providing new access to platforms via the new Access for All (AfA) bridge being delivered separately by Network Rail; * removing the existing subway which links the south side of Ferry Lane with the Station; * extending the existing bridge to form a new Station entrance from Hale Village, providing improved access from the east to Tottenham Hale transport interchange; * re-routing the London Underground escape route and relocating the vent shaft; * providing a new, upgraded Station control facility; and * retail units. The full plans can be seen on Haringey Council's website. Funding is being sought to increase the number of lines from Coppermill Junction (between Lea Bridge and Tottenham Hale) and Angel Road to provide a turn-up-and-go four trains per hour service for the Lea Valley. In February 2013, the Crossrail task force of business group London First, chaired by former Secretary of State for Transport Andrew Adonis, published its recommendations on Crossrail 2, favouring a route almost identical to the regional option proposed by TfL in 2011. The report was endorsed by Network Rail. This proposal will see four tracks restored through Tottenham Hale and direct links to South-West London. Miscellaneous Four of London's last remaining trolleybus poles formerly stood on Ferry Lane as it crosses over the railway tracks by the station. These have since been removed as of 2016.

There is a secessionist movement in Newfoundland based on its unique history, and as a result of its grievances and broken promises with both the federal government and the government of Quebec. Prior to 1949 the area was a self-governing Dominion (Dominion of Newfoundland). \\"The root of our trouble is centred in the relationship between the two countries, between Newfoundland as a country and Canada\\" according to James Halley, a former lawyer involved in negotiating a deal to get Newfoundland into Canada in 1949. According to a July 2003 report, secessionism was on the riseCBC.ca 1 July 2013 In 2004, a \\"flag flap\\" occurred when the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador removed all Canadian flags from government buildings and raised provincial flags instead.CBC.ca 24 December 2014 Tensions have since eased; however, a non-organized movement has emerged amongst citizens and the ability of potential premiers to appeal to a strong sense of Newfoundland nationalism is imperative to forming a government. The secessionist movement in Newfoundland and Labrador is most commonly associated with a flag under several names, including the \\"Pink, White and Green\\", \\"Flag of the Republic of Newfoundland & Labrador\\", or officially as the Newfoundland Tricolour. =Nova Scotia= Shortly after the Confederation of three British colonies (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the Province of Canada) to form the Dominion of Canada in 1867, opponents of Confederation in Nova Scotia began promoting the withdrawal of that province from the new confederation. The Anti-Confederation Party won 18 of the 19 Nova Scotia seats in the new House of Commons of Canada in the 1867 general election, and 36 of the 38 seats in the Nova Scotia legislature, but did not succeed in achieving independence for Nova Scotia. In 1990, just before the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, then-premier John Buchanan predicted Nova Scotia and the rest of Atlantic Canada would have to join the United States if the accord failed. =Quebec= The Quebec sovereignty movement seeks independence from Canada for the province of Quebec. This movement often seeks what has been termed \\"sovereignty-association\\", which is sovereignty for Quebec within an economic association or union with the rest of Canada. Since the Quiet Revolution, the many available options have garnered support from Quebecers. The sovereignty movement has spawned a variety of political parties, such as the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, a social democratic political party at the provincial level in Quebec that has governed the province for various periods since 1976, and the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, which sometimes wins the majority of seats in Quebec. This party aims to promote Quebec's sovereignty and purports to defend the interests of Quebec at the federal level of government. The Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec (FLQ), was a terrorist organization in the 1960s and early 1970s that used violence to promote independence for Quebec. Although they both advocated a sovereigntist agenda, the FLQ and its violent tactics were denounced by the Parti Qu√©b√©cois. Since the Quiet Revolution, sovereigntist sentiments have been stoked by the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982 which was introduced without the consent of the National Assembly of Quebec and by numerous failed attempts at constitutional reform, which have sought to address Quebec's distinct society. Two provincial referendums, in 1980 and 1995, rejected proposals for sovereignty, with majorities of 60% in 1980 and only 50.6% in 1995, respectively. Given the narrow federalist victory in 1995, a reference was made by the Chr√©tien government to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1996 regarding the legality of a unilateral secession of Quebec. This resulted in the passage of the Clarity Act in 2000. =Western Canada= Numerous political parties in the western provinces, believing there to be no other solution for stemming apparent \\"Western alienation\\" by Central Canada, have sought independence. These movements are strongest in Alberta and British Columbia, but lesser ones exist in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. These movements have also assumed that Canada's northern territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut) would also be a part of a new Western Canadian union. Parties advocating Western separation include the Western Canada Concept, the Western Independence Party, and the Western Block Party. These parties have not achieved much success, however. In the early 1980s, in Saskatchewan, the Unionest Party advocated the western provinces join the United States. In 1995, Premier of Saskatchewan Roy Romanow secretly formed a committee on consequences if Quebec seceded. The most seriously studied option was strengthening Saskatchewan's relationships with other western provinces because Romanow said in 2014, Ontario would become closer to the US economically and Atlantic Canada would become \\"an island\\". Other possibilities included also seceding from Canada, and joining the US. Romanow said that predecessor Allan Blakeney had similarly studied options for Saskatchewan during the 1980 Quebec referendum. On July 12, 2003, the Western Independence Party of Saskatchewan (WIPS) was created and registered as a Provincial Party, running candidates in 17 ridings in the 2003 Saskatchewan general election A poll by the Western Standard conducted from June 29, 2005, to July 5, 2005, finds 35.6% of residents of the four provinces think \\"Western Canadians should begin to explore the idea of forming their own country.\\" On January 12, 2020, the Wexit party was formed federally. Alberta The Alberta Independence Party promoted independence for the province of Alberta, either on its own or in union with the other western provinces, in the 1990s, but it is now defunct. The Separation Party of Alberta nominated candidates in the 2004 Alberta provincial election. Manitoba In January‚ÄìFebruary 1868, a small group of settlers declared a Republic of Caledonia, later the Republic of Manitobah, at Portage-la-Prairie in Hudson's Bay Company land that was to be incorporated into Canada. These settlers aimed to use this declaration to obtain favourable terms (for themselves) for the entry of the area into Confederation. The declaration was not recognized by Canadian or British authorities, and the republic soon collapsed. British Columbia and Yukon Shortly after joining Confederation, British Columbia threatened to secede after the initial failure of the transcontinental railway promises which were one of its conditions for joining Canada. During the disputes over what led to the Columbia River Treaty, BC Premier WAC Bennett threatened to take BC out of Canada - and to take Yukon as well - if Ottawa and Washington would not accede to his demands. There is an ongoing informal movement in British Columbia to create a separate country of Cascadia. While Yukon lacks a formal separatist movement or party, there is an element of dissatisfaction in the territory as well. However, as anticipation of a Conservative government in Ottawa built, the number of Yukoners that would be in favour of secession (if it included British Columbia and Alberta) has steadily dropped from a high of 18% in August 2005 to a mere 8% by January 2006. Many First Nations politicians and some First Nations in BC, nearly all claiming and still technically holding unceded sovereignty, want varying degrees of autonomy, with some asserting outright independence. The Vancouver Island Party is the first secessionist movement that aims to secede from British Columbia and become a separate province by 2021, instead of leaving Canada like other secession movements. Other movements =Republic of Madawaska= The Republic of Madawaska occupied what is now the northwest corner of New Brunswick, and lies partially in Quebec and the American state of Maine. The origins of the so-called republic lie in the 1783 Treaty of Versailles, which established the border between the United States of America and the British North American colonies. The Madawaska region remained in dispute between Britain and the US until 1842. In Canada, Madawaska was considered part of Quebec until the 1850s, when the border with New Brunswick was modified.Mitchell map of 1850 shows Madawaska in QC, whereas Mitchell map of 1860 shows it in NB The so-called \\"Republic\\" is now a purely ceremonial entity. In popular culture Occasionally regions of Canada have declared themselves to be \\"independent\\" in a non-serious, satirical or promotional way. These \\"movements\\" are taken for what they are and not considered secessionist. =Republic of Rathnelly= The Rathnelly neighbourhood in Toronto made headlines in 1967, while celebrating Canada's 100th birthday. During the celebrations, Rathnelly residents playfully declared themselves as a republic independent of Canada. To mark their independence, the \\"Republic of Rathnelly\\" elected a queen, organized a parade, and issued Republic of Rathnelly passports to everyone in the neighbourhood. The new nation conscripted all 8- to 14-year-old citizens to form a militia, known as the Rathnelly Irregulars, and armed them with 1,000 helium balloons (the Rathnelly \\"air force\\"). The \\"Republic of Rathnelly\\" continues to hold annual street parties.

In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is harder but shorter than aerobic exercise. The biochemistry of anaerobic exercise involves a process called glycolysis, in which glucose is converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary source of energy for cellular reactions. Lactic acid is produced at an increased rate during anaerobic exercise, causing it to build up quickly. The build-up of lactate above the lactate threshold (also called anaerobic threshold) is a major contributor to muscle fatigue. Anaerobic exercise may be used by personal trainers to help their clients build endurance, muscle strength, and power.  Metabolism  Anaerobic metabolism is a natural part of metabolic energy expenditure. Fast twitch muscles (as compared to slow twitch muscles) operate using anaerobic metabolic systems, such that any use of fast twitch muscle fibers leads to an increased anaerobic energy expenditure. Intense exercise lasting upwards of four minutes (e.g. a mile race) may still have considerable anaerobic energy expenditure. An example is High-intensity interval training, an exercise strategy that is performed under anaerobic conditions at intensities that reach an excess of 90% of the maximum heart rate. Anaerobic energy expenditure is difficult to accurately quantify. Some methods estimate the anaerobic component of an exercise by determining the maximum accumulated oxygen deficit or measuring the lactic acid formation in muscle mass. In contrast, aerobic exercise includes lower intensity activities performed for longer periods of time. Activities such as walking, jogging, rowing, and cycling require oxygen to generate the energy needed for prolonged exercise (i.e., aerobic energy expenditure). For sports that require repeated short bursts of exercise, the aerobic system acts to replenish energy stores during recovery periods to fuel the next energy burst. Therefore, training strategies for many sports demand that both aerobic and anaerobic systems be developed. As muscles contract, Calcium ions release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by release channels. These channels close and calcium pumps open to relax muscles. After extended exercise, the release channels can begin to leak and cause muscle fatigue. The anaerobic energy systems are: *The alactic anaerobic system, which consists of high energy phosphates, adenosine triphosphate, and creatine phosphate; andRobert Donatelli, Sports-specific Rehabilitation, p. 40, Elsevier, 2007 . *The lactic anaerobic system, which features anaerobic glycolysis. High energy phosphates are stored in limited quantities within muscle cells. Anaerobic glycolysis exclusively uses glucose (and glycogen) as a fuel in the absence of oxygen, or more specifically, when ATP is needed at rates that exceed those provided by aerobic metabolism. The consequence of such rapid glucose breakdown is the formation of lactic acid (or more appropriately, its conjugate base lactate at biological pH levels). Physical activities that last up to about thirty seconds rely primarily on the former ATP-CP phosphagen system. Beyond this time, both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis-based metabolic systems are utilized. The by-product of anaerobic glycolysis-- lactate--has traditionally been thought to be detrimental to muscle function. However, this appears likely only when lactate levels are very high. Elevated lactate levels are only one of many changes that occur within and around muscle cells during intense exercise that can lead to fatigue. Fatigue, that is muscle failure, is a complex subject that depends on more than just changes to lactate concentration. Energy availability, oxygen delivery, perception to pain, and other psychological factors all contribute to muscular fatigue. Elevated muscle and blood lactate concentrations are a natural consequence of any physical exertion. The effectiveness of anaerobic activity can be improved through training. Anaerobic exercise also increases an individual's basal metabolic rate (BMR).  Examples Anaerobic exercise is an intense workout, while aerobic exercise is a long endurance workout. Some examples of anaerobic exercises include sprints, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and strength training.

Instead of pulleys, the Soloflex used an elastomer Weightstrap made of heavy-duty rubber to create variable resistance. The company started out as Bucksteel Mfg in Roswell, New Mexico, in a small plant on the old Army Air Force base south of town. It is now based in Hillsboro, Oregon. History Soloflex, Inc. was established in 1978 by Jerry Wilson. The idea behind the weight straps came from Jerry's days flying small airplanes. The resistance on the plane's controls came from the bungee cord. Jerry used this idea to create the Weightstraps that provide enough resistance to equal large amounts of free weight. In 1980, the company relocated to Hillsboro, Oregon. After the move to Oregon, Bucksteel changed its name to Soloflex. The company then used model Scott Madsen in an infomercial to promote their product. By 1984 the company's sales had grown to $18 million annually. Over time, several additions to the machine were made such as butterfly attachments and leg extensions. The newest product addition is the Soloflex Whole Body Vibration (WBV) Platform. Vibrating while you are lifting weights is thought to magnify the conditioning effects to help promote faster muscle growth. Products Soloflex home gym machines use an elastic element to provide resistance. The product also comes with an instructional DVD. Soloflex's WBV Platform recently made news in July 2007 for a Consumer Reports review that demonstrated it had been using claims from research that may not apply to their machine. \\"At press time, even the research on its Web site involved competitors‚Äô products and lab machines.

It, and particularly its tributaries, are important streams for whitewater enthusiasts. The Obed River rises in Cumberland County, Tennessee, just south of Crossville. It is bridged by U.S. Highway 70 between downtown Crossville and the municipal airport, and meets its confluence with the Little Obed River near a bridge on U.S. Highway 70N and an abandoned railroad bridge which was formerly part of the rail system linking Nashville and Knoxville. Shortly thereafter, it is bridged by U.S. Highway 127 and Interstate 40. Except during periods of very high flow, the stream is scarcely visible from these bridges because of the depth of its gorge. Obed Wild and Scenic River From there the stream enters a rather remote area. After several miles it is bridged by State Route 298 (Genesis Road). From this point to its mouth it is designated as a National Wild and Scenic River along with Clear Creek and Daddys Creek. The area is maintained by the National Park Service. The direction of flow changes gradually from largely south to north to largely west to east. Shortly after crossing into Morgan County it receives the flow of Daddys Creek, which is a good whitewater rafting stream. Downstream from this is the mouth of Clear Creek. This stream is also part of the Obed River \\"Wild and Scenic\\" designation; like Daddys Creek, it too is a premiere whitewater stream during periods of high flow. =Amenities= The National Park Service maintains a visitor center located at 208 North Maiden Street in Wartburg.

It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between and . Its three-letter station code is NUM and it is in Travelcard zone 3. It is one of the stations that can be used to access Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The station and all trains serving it are operated by Greater Anglia. The station was upgraded starting 2017 to add an extra track and a new island platform. It had one of north London's few level crossings to its immediate north, but this was removed in the rebuilding of the station as a result of the STAR (Stratford to Angel Road) project. Northumberland Park Depot for the London Underground's Victoria line is sited adjacent to the station and it is close to Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. History Northumberland Park railway station in 2006 Northumberland Park was opened on 1 April 1842Chronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley as a Halt on the Northern & Eastern Railway. The station was originally named Marsh Lane after the country lane to Tottenham Marshes on which it is situated. The Northern and Eastern Railway was leased by the Eastern Counties Railway in 1844 who took over operation of the line. The line was initially laid to a gauge of but already this had been identified as non standard and between 5 September and 7 October 1844 the whole network was re-laid to . In June 1852 the station was renamed Park station. The Eastern Counties Railway was taken over by the Great Eastern Railway in 1862. In 1882 the line through the station became part of a major rail freight artery with the opening of the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway. This provided a link for the Great Eastern Railway from the coal fields in the north to London. This led to a second pair of running lines known as the Slow Lines (the ones that exist today - 2013 - are the old Fast Lines) being added in 1913. In 1919 as well as the two sets of main lines there were some private sidings serving local industries including Tottenham Gas works. Adjacent to the station was a marshalling yard for goods traffic. The yard was under the control of the station master and had three reception sidings and fourteen sorting sidings. Its purpose was the servicing of the various lineside industries on the southern part of the Lea Valley Lines as well as the Enfield Town and Chingford Branch Line Chingford branch goods depots. Additionally it used to handle the perishable goods traffic as the policy was to keep this apart from more general traffic.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 79 page 32 Ted Summerfield (Letter) July 1994 In 1923 operation passed to the London & North Eastern Railway and the station was renamed to its current title, Northumberland Park on 1 July 1923, this is also the name of the surrounding district, in Tottenham, North London. On 7 January 1931 there was an accident at Northumberland Park when a coal train hit a shunting locomotive which was then propelled into a brake van of another freight train. This resulted in the brake van catching fire and the train guard was burnt to death. The signal box (built 1914) was located near the level crossing and was raised up on stilts.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 135 page 13 Bernard Crawford (Cambridge Line memories) July 2008 In 1940 during World War 2 an unexploded anti-aircraft shell fell on the adjacent marshalling yard. Following nationalisation in 1948 the station became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways. Around 1961 the marshalling yard was closedGreat Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 76 page 24 Dave Taylor October 1993 and the site used for the Northumberland Park Depot of London Underground's Victoria line. In 2013 this is the only above ground location where Victoria line stock can be seen and the depot is joined to the main Victoria line at a junction north of Seven Sisters tube station. The Lea Valley line between Copper Mill Junction and Cheshunt was electrified at 25 kV in 1969.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 122 pages 25 Rodger Green April 2005 The station was also rebuilt at this time with the work being completed in 1970. Prior to the completion of electrification in 1969, passenger services between Cheshunt and London Liverpool Street through Northumberland Park were normally operated by Class 125 diesel multiple units (which had been purpose- built for the line in 1958). When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Rail. The signal box (by this date only controlling the level crossing gates) was closed. Recent history Following privatisation in 1994 management of the station was initially allocated to a business unit which succeeded the old British Railways structure before being taken over by West Anglia Great Northern (WAGN) in January 1997. Initially owned by Prism Rail, National Express took over operation in July 2000. In 1994 responsibility for the operational infrastructure passed to Railtrack. In August 2002 signalling control was transferred to the Liverpool Street Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC).Great Eastern Railway Society Journal volume 135 page 14 Chris Cook(photo caption) July 2008 The WAGN franchise was replaced in 2003 by the 'One' franchise although this was later renamed National Express East Anglia. The following year following financial difficulties Railtrack was superseded by Network Rail. In February 2012 operation of the station changed once again with Abellio Greater Anglia taking over the Greater Anglia franchise. In March 2017, following consultation with local authorities and the public, the decision was made to permanently close the ticket office at Northumberland Park. The station is now unmanned with assistance reached via station help points. The New Northumberland Park station will also be constructed without a ticket office. =Proposals and upgrade= An island platform, a footbridge, and a third track constructed at Northumberland Park railway station. The level crossing was removed. In 2007 Haringey Council supported proposals for platforms for the Victoria line to be built at Northumberland Park. These would be to the east of the main line platforms between the main line and the Northumberland Park Depot. This was supported by the former Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. It is claimed that this would aid regeneration of the area, and that better transport links would have to be part of plans to increase capacity at White Hart Lane.alwaystouchout.com -Victoria line to Northumberland Park In February 2013, the Crossrail task force of business group London First, chaired by former Secretary of State for Transport Andrew Adonis, published its recommendations on Crossrail 2, favouring a route almost identical to the regional option proposed by TfL in 2011. The report was endorsed by Network Rail. If this happens it is likely that few if any main line trains will continue to call at Northumberland Park. This proposal will see four tracks restored through Northumberland Park to Tottenham Hale and direct links via central London to the south west suburbs. In 2017, as part of a ¬£170m Lee Valley Rail Programme to build a 5.5 km new track between Stratford and a new Meridian Water railway station, the construction of a new island platform with lifts and a new footbridge at Northumberland Park started. The new platform accommodates the new third track allowing an additional two trains per hour to be operated. The level crossing for cars was closed and removed. The work is scheduled to be completed in 2019. Connections London Buses Routes 192, 318, 341, 476 and W3 serve the station.

He was born in the town of Pendjikent. Under the Soviet Union, he was both Pravda and Izvestiya's correspondent in Tajikistan at various times. He also served as head of the Union of Journalists of Tajikistan. Latifi branched into politics in 1989, becoming deputy chairman of the Tajik Council of Ministers. He became involved in the peace process that followed the country's bloody post-independence civil war. In 1992, he became Deputy Prime Minister, as part of Tajikistan's national reconciliation government. Over time, Latifi became a prominent opposition figure, as a senior member in the United Tajik Opposition. This led to a period in exile in Tehran and Moscow between 1992 and 1997. While in Moscow, on August 4, 1994, Latifi was badly beaten outside his Moscow apartment, and key documents relating to the peace process were stolen. On his return to Tajikistan in September 1997, he chaired the panel for legal issues under the National Reconciliation Commission, a role which he continued until his death. On September 22, 1998, at around 8am, Latifi was shot at point blank range outside his apartment in Dushanbe. His murder sparked condemnation from both the government and opposition, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the non-government organization Human Rights Watch. His death was also mentioned in Time Magazine. The murder, which all parties to the conflict agreed was politically motivated, also resulted in the UTO's eventual suspension of their role in the government, temporarily bringing the peace process to the point of collapse. There is still some speculation as to who killed Latifi. Crime figure Abdullo Tursunov was tried and found guilty in June 2000. However, two years before, in January 1998, another man, Ravshan Gafurov was captured by police, and promptly confessed. Gafurov was later killed by police after attempting to escape custody. Tajik police had also claimed that the murder, and several other similar killings, were linked to Islamic Renaissance Party Chairman Said Abdullo Nuri.

She was one of the founding members of the La Movida Madrile√±a, the cultural and artistic movement that followed the end of Francoist Spain. This movement, in which music, the arts, cinema and fashion erupted and collided to show what Spain had become under Franco. She has participated, since the late 1970s, in several music groups: Kaka de Luxe 1977, Alaska y los Pegamoides 1980, Alaska y Dinarama 1983, and since 1989, the Spanish electropop band, Fangoria. Today, Alaska continues to perform and has become an icon of 1980s Spain. Life and career =Early life= Alaska was born in Mexico City, Mexico on June 13, 1963. Her father, from Asturias, Spain, was in Mexico living in exile during the Spanish Civil War along with her Cuban mother, who was also living in Mexico in exile from Fidel Castro. In 1973, a few years before caudillo Francisco Franco died, her parents decided to move to Spain, settling in Madrid. Alaska was a big fan of artists such as Lou Reed or T-Rex, but David Bowie was her biggest influence. She even told her mother that she would love to be a boy just so she could be gay. At 14 she collaborated translating Robert Crumb's comic strips for a fanzine called Bazofia, using the pen name Alaska. She chose the name inspired by the lyrics of Reed's song \\"Caroline Says II\\" (\\"All her friends call her Alaska\\"/../\\"It's so cold in Alaska\\"). The birth of punk also had a big influence on the young Alaska, who soon decided to form a band. She went to El Rastro, a famous flea market in Madrid, looking for band members, where she met Nacho Canut and Carlos Berlanga. =1970s and 1980s= Alaska performing in Madrid, Spain In 1977, Alaska along with Fernando M√°rquez, Nacho Canut, Carlos Berlanga and Enrique Sierra, among others, formed the band Kaka de Luxe, one of the first Spanish punk rock bands, where she played rhythm guitar. In 1979, Gara, Canut, Berlanga, Ana Curra and Eduardo Benavente formed the band Alaska y los Pegamoides. Alaska was lead singer for the first time with the group \\"Pegamoides\\". They took the name as a tribute to one of the bands they admired: Siouxsie and the Banshees. Due to some artistic differences, Carlos Berlanga left \\"Pegamoides\\", and with Nacho Canut they formed \\"Dinarama\\". At this time, Eduardo Benavente and Ana Curra were involved in Par√°lisis Permanente, one of the first goth bands in Spain. A few months after Carlos Berlanga left the band, \\"Pegamoides\\" split up. In 1982, Alaska joined \\"Dinarama\\" and the band released their first album in 1983 titled Canciones Profanas under the name Dinarama + Alaska. The band decided to use the name \\"Alaska y Dinarama\\" in their following album, Deseo carnal, and they kept the name until 1989. In 1989, Carlos Berlanga left \\"Alaska y Dinarama\\" in the middle of their tour of their last album Fan Fatal where all songs are tribute to the bands they loved and admired over the years: Ramones, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Michael Jackson, Depeche Mode, Aviador Dro, Par√°lisis Permanente, etc. When \\"Alaska y Dinarama\\" split up, Nacho Canut and Alaska decide to call themselves \\"Fangoria\\". They changed their music style to electronic pop, in the style of Pet Shop Boys. They released their first album Salto Mortal with Hispavox, their record company since forming \\"Pegamoides\\". After that they left the company and released a trilogy with different independent companies: Un d√≠a cualquiera en Vulcano I, Un d√≠a cualquiera en Vulcano II and Un d√≠a cualquiera en Vulcano III. They did not play many concerts. It was during this period that Alaska became an icon for the LGBT community and became very active supporting Madrid Gay Pride. Subterfuge, an important indie company released Fangoria's next album: Una Temporada en el Infierno, considered by some to be a masterpiece of electronic music. Fangoria started selling loads of CDs and the band became very popular. Another album with Subterfuge, Naturaleza muerta proved that Fangoria was an amazing electronic band and that Alaska was a fantastic performer. Some creative differences with Subterfuge forced Fangoria to leave its new recording label. In 2004, DRO (Warner) released their next album: Arquitectura Ef√≠mera. In the late 1980s, Alaska was the host a Spanish children's show on Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola called La Bola de Cristal. =21st Century= In 2006, Fangoria visited Mexico to promote their new album El Extra√±o Viaje. Alaska appeared on two sketches of Telehit's Desde Gayola (a Mexican parody show). In the first sketch, she appeared as herself in an interview with Tesorito, in the second one, she played the character of Galaxia (a DJ) with Supermana, Chef Ornica & Manig√ºis.

It runs for from an interchange with New York State Route 5A (NY 5A) and NY 5S in downtown Utica to a pair of interchanges with Genesee Street east of the city. All of I-790 is concurrent with NY 5, and the portion south of NY 49 is also concurrent with NY 8 and NY 12\\\\. I-790 connects to exit 31 of the New York State Thruway (I-90) by way of an interchange near its east end. According to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), I-790 follows NY 5 to Genesee Street while the highway leading to Thruway exit 31 is merely a pair of ramps connecting I-790 to its parent. The north‚Äìsouth portion of I-790 between its western terminus and NY 49 is named the North‚ÄìSouth Arterial Highway. Route description Diagram of the interchange between I-790, NY 5, NY 8, NY 12 and NY 49 I-790 begins at an interchange connecting NY 5A and NY 5S to the North‚ÄìSouth Arterial (NY 5, NY 8, and NY 12) on the northern edge of the city of Utica. The route heads northeast from this point, overlapping with NY 5, NY 8, and NY 12 along a six-lane limited-access highway leading away from downtown. As the road leaves the NY 5A and NY 5S junction, it crosses over the CSX Transportation's Mohawk Subdivision rail line, which runs along the northern edge of the interchange. Past the tracks, the dense commercial and residential blocks that comprise downtown Utica give way to a mostly undeveloped strip of land surrounding the Mohawk River and Erie Canal. I-790 continues on a northeasterly track across the open area, crossing the Mohawk River and an abandoned railroad grade just north of the waterway. As I-790 crosses the Erie Canal, it enters a complex interchange built around the New York State Thruway (I-90). While NY 8 and NY 12 continue north through the junction, I-790 and NY 5 exit to the southeast, leaving NY 8 and NY 12 to meet NY 49 adjacent to the Thruway. The two directions of NY 49 are physically split by the Thruway; while the eastbound direction runs along the southern edge of the Thruway, the westbound half flanks the Thruway's westbound lanes. East of the interchange, I-790 and NY 5 take over NY 49's split right-of-way, following an identical configuration for about through Utica's northern suburbs. I-790 continues east along the Thruway to the exit with northbound Genesee Street, where the Interstate Highway designation ends and the highways adjacent to the Thruway become solely designated as NY 5. While I-790 eastbound has an exit leading directly to exit 31 of the Thruway, Utica's only exit along the highway, there is no direct connection from exit 31 to I-790 westbound. Instead, I-790 westbound uses part of Genesee Street to get between the I-90 interchange and the highways carrying NY 5 along the Thruway. History The portion of the North‚ÄìSouth Arterial between Oriskany Street (NY 5A and NY 5S) and River Road was completed in the late 1950s. By 1961, a two-lane, limited-access highway was constructed along the south side of the New York State Thruway between the Arterial and Thruway exit 31\\\\. The road left the Arterial just north of the Erie Canal and had one intermediate interchange with Genesee Street before connecting directly to I-90 at exit 31. The two-lane connector and the section of the North‚ÄìSouth Arterial between Oriskany Street and the connector was designated as I-790 by 1965. The connector was rebuilt as a four-lane freeway that straddles I-90. The direct connection from I-90 to I-790 was eliminated at this time, necessitating the use of surface streets and passing through traffic lights for traffic to reach I-790. Future There are efforts within NYSDOT to renumber NY Routes 49 and 365 (from Utica to Thruway Exit 33 in the Town of Verona) to NY Route 790, with the eventual plan of renumbering it again as an extension of I-790. The cost for the conversion to Interstate standards is estimated to be between $150 million and $200 million. U.S. Representative Michael Arcuri introduced legislation in July 2010 that would redesignate the portion of NY 49 from the North‚ÄìSouth Arterial in Utica to NY 825 in Rome as part of I-790. The conversion is expected to cost between $1.5 and $2 million, which would be used to install new signage along the expressway. By adding the Utica‚ÄìRome Expressway to the Interstate Highway System, the area would receive approximately $10 million in additional federal highway funding over the next five years. According to Arcuri, the proposed redesignation is part of a larger, long-term goal of creating an Interstate Highway-standard freeway that would begin at Thruway exit 33 in Verona and pass through Rome before ending at Thruway exit 31\\\\. The portion of NY 49 east of NY 825 already meets Interstate Highway standards.

She is known for being involved in a 1989 experiment on circadian rhythms, in which she voluntarily isolated herself for four months in an underground room thirty feet down a cave in Carlsbad, New Mexico, away from all outside indications of night and day. The experiment lasted from January 13, 1989, until May 22, 1989. In total, Follini spent some 130 days in the cave, thus breaking the women's world record for longest cave isolation. Career Hailing from Ancona, Italy, Follini worked as an interior decorator. Out of 20 candidates, Follini was chosen for the experiment because she possessed an \\"introspective nature\\" and \\"mental discipline\\". At that time, she was 27 years old. =Experiment= The scientific experiment commenced on January 13, 1989. It was organised by Pioneer Frontier Explorations and NASA. It took place in the \\"Lost Cave\\" in New Mexico. Inside her twenty by twelve foot acrylic glass room, away from all cues to the normal 24-hour daily cycle, her biological clock drifted away from its regular rhythm to following first a 28-hour day, and later on a 48-hour one. She started staying awake for up to more than twenty hours and sleeping up to ten hours at a time. Her only companions were her guitar, a computer, two \\"friendly mice\\" named Giuseppe and Nicoletta, a few frogs, and grasshoppers. During the course of the experiment, she was reported to have felt gloomy, with no human to cheer her up. Her only mode of communication was via the computer terminals. To curb her boredom, Follini would decorate the cave with cutouts made from cardboard. With her slowed-down daily cycle, her meals were more spread out and she lost in weight. Follini was most of the time fed beans and rice, which partially resulted in her losing vitamin D. She reported that at one point her menstrual cycle had stopped. She regularly did judo to maintain her strength and flexibility. When she finally emerged from the cave at the experiment's end on May 22, 1989, and was asked to guess the date, she estimated that it was March 14 or 15 ‚Äî only two months from the start of the experiment instead of the four that had actually transpired. She was described as \\"looking pale and thin\\" after coming out from the cave.

The ridge of the Cumbre Vieja trends in an approximate north-south direction and covers the southern two- thirds of the island. Several volcanic craters are located on the summit ridge and flanks. Volcanic history La Palma is a volcanic ocean island, located on the African Plate and is currently ‚Äì along with Tenerife ‚Äì one of the most volcanically active of the Canary Islands.Carracedo, J.C. 1996. A simple model for the genesis of large gravitational landslide hazards in the Canary Islands. In McGuire, W: Jones, & Neuberg, J. P. (eds). Volcano Instability on the Earth and Other Planets. Geological Society, London. Special Publication, 110, 125‚Äì135. Historical eruptions on the Cumbre Vieja occurred in 1470, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949 and 1971. Since ~125 ka, all sub-aerial eruptive activity has been associated with the Cumbre Vieja with eruptions ranging over the whole ~25 kilometres long ridge. The Cumbre Vieja is known from submarine surveys to continue south of Punta de Fuencaliente (the Point of the Hot Fountain). Volcanic activity connected with the submarine extension has not been observed or recorded. Detailed geological mapping shows that the distribution and orientation of vents and feeder dykes within the volcano have shifted from a triple rift system (typical of most volcanic ocean islands) to one consisting of a single north-south rift.Carracedo, J. C; 1994. The Canary Islands: an example of structural control on the growth of large oceanic- island volcanoes. J. Volcanol. Geotherm Res. 60, 225‚Äì241.Carracedo, J. C; 1999. Growth, Structure, Instability and Collapse of Canarian Volcanoes and Comparisons with Hawaiian Volcanoes. J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res. 94, 1‚Äì19. It is hypothesised that this structural reorganisation is in response to evolving stress patterns associated with the development of a possible detachment fault under the volcano's west flank. Siebert (1984)Siebert, L; 1984. Large volcanic debris avalanches: characteristics of source areas, deposits and associated eruptions. J. Volcanol. Geotherm Res. 22, 163‚Äì197. showed that such failures are due to the intrusion of parallel and sub-parallel dykes into a rift. This causes the flanks to become over-steep and this inevitably causes the structure of the volcano to become unstable and catastrophic failure may occur. There is no evidence that the 1949 section of the rift extends in a north-south direction beyond its surface expression, nor that there is a developing detachment plane. Research is ongoing. =1949 eruption= Crater del Hoyo Negro, 2008 The onset of the eruption was witnessed by a shepherd who was tending his flock of sheep on the flank of the Nambroque ‚Äì (Bonelli-Rubio 1950, is explicit that the shepherd was only tending sheep). He was startled to hear noises emanating from the Duraznero vent and became extremely alarmed when material started being expelled from the vent. In a state of panic he fled the area and sought refuge as far from the vent as he could. The only contemporaneous account of the eruption was published in 1950 by one of the scientists ‚Äì Juan Bonelli-RubioBonelli-Rubio, J. M; 1950. Contribucion al estudio de la erupcion del Nambroque o San Juan. Madrid: Inst. Geografico y Catastral, 25 pp. who witnessed the eruption first hand and recorded details of the various phenomena that occurred during the eruption. All other published accounts are based upon Bonelli-Rubio's observations. The next report regarding the eruption was a joint publication by Ortiz and Bonelli- Rubio published in 1951.Ortiz, J. R., & Bonelli Rubio, J. M; 1951. La erupci√≥n del Nambroque (Junio-Agosto de 1949). Madrid: Talleres del Instituto Geogr√°fico y Catastral, 100 pp. This drew heavily on Bonelli-Rubio's observations and also analysis of various phenomena associated with the eruption. Both accounts are published in Spanish. The eruption started on 24 June 1949 ‚Äì the feast day of St John, which is why in Spanish texts the eruption is referred to as \\"la erupcion del Nambroque o San Juan,\\" which in English is \\"The Eruption of the Nambroque or St John's volcano.\\" During the 1949 eruption, eruptive activity was located at three vents‚ÄîDuraznero, Llano del Banco, and Hoyo Negro‚Äîmild strombolian activity occurred at the Duraznero vent. Lava was erupted from the Llano del Banco vents, whilst only mild phreatomagmatic emissions occurred at the Hoyo Negro vent. Then on 30 July ‚Äì the last day of eruptive activity, lava was erupted at the Duraznero fissure and vent. During the eruption on 1 and 2 July, two strong earthquakes with an estimated intensity of VIII on the Modified Mercalli Scale also occurred, the epicentre was calculated to be near Jedey. Following the earthquakes a fracture was noted and it had a length of approximately one and half kilometres. It was traceable to the Hoyo Negro and Duraznero vents, making a total length of about two and half kilometres or about 1/10 of the exposed length of the Cumbre Vieja, and parts of the western half of the Cumbre Vieja ridge had apparently moved about 1 metre sideways and 2 metres downwards towards the Atlantic Ocean. It was only in the vicinity of the Duraznero and Hoyo Negro vents that the vertical displacement attained about 4 metres. As of 2009, the fracture is still visible and still has the same dimensions recorded in 1949. The lava lake La Malforada with Monta√±a del Fraile, in the background Vulcano Deseada The timeline for the eruption, according to Bonelli-Rubio, is as follows: The first reported seismic activity was noted on the southern rim of the Caldera de Taburiente on 23 July 1936 at about 23:30 (11.30 pm) local time, with further activity noted over the next two days. During the following years periodic seismic activity occurred, but due to the absence of monitoring equipment, the only reports are those recorded in the media. Then at about 09:00 (local time) on 24 June 1949, the Duraznero vent opened with mildly explosive activity, venting of gases, and rocks; with eruptive activity continuing in this manner until 6 July. During this phase a strong earthquake occurred on 1 July and again on 2 July with an estimated intensity of VIII on the Modified Mercalli Scale. Visits to the summit region revealed a crack about 1.5 km (~1 mile) long which extended in a northerly direction from the Hoyo Negro (Black Hole) and about 1 km (~0.5-mile) south to the Duraznero vent making a total length of about 2.5 km (~1.6-mile), (this crack is the subject of research and heated debate as to whether it indicates initial failure of the western flank ‚Äì or not). Later analysis placed the epicentre north of the township of Jedey. Eruptive activity at the Duraznero vent ceased on 6 July with only degassing continuing. No eruptive activity occurred on 7 July. On 8 July eruptive activity commenced at the Llano del Banco vents ‚Äì about 4 km (~2.8miles) north of the Duraznero vent, as lava was erupted and flowed down the western flank. The vents opened progressively up the barranco (ravine), forming a series of en echelon (diagonally side by side), vents. On 10 July the westward flow of lava from the Llano del Banco vents reached the coast at Puerto de Naos and entered the Atlantic Ocean, forming a lava delta, the velocity is estimated at ~14 metres (approximately 46 feet) per sec. On 12 July mildly explosive activity commenced at the Hoyo Negro (Black Hole) with emissions of rocks, fumes and some phreatomagmatic activity indicating that the eruption had encountered ground waters. Activity at the Hoyo Negro ceased on 22 July, but continued at the Llano del Banco vents until 26 July. Only residual fumarolic activity and thermal emissions then occurred until 30 July when the Duraznero vent and fissure re-activated. Lava then flowed from the Duraznero vent and fissure, filling the adjacent crater of El Fraile and created a lava lake. This subsequently overflowed and the lava flowed down the eastern flank towards the ocean. It finally stopped about 30m (about 100 feet) from the ocean. Also later, on 30 July all eruptive activity ceased and only residual fumarolic activity continued until 4 August; thereafter there was only thermal emissions. It is estimated that approximately 60 million cubic metres of lava was erupted during the eruption.Kl√ºgel, A; Schmincke, H ‚ÄìU; White, J. D. L; and Hoernle, K. A; 1999. Chronology and volcanology of the 1949 multi-vent rift-zone eruption on La Palma (Canary Islands). J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res. 94, 267‚Äì282. Volcanic Explosivity Index The eruption style ranged from effusive ‚Äì mildly explosive at the Duraznero and Llano del Banco vents to mildly explosive at the Hoyo Negro vent and was strombolian in style. It therefore is classed as having a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 1 or 2.Newhall, C. G.; Self, S; 1982. The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI): An Estimate of Explosive Magnitude for Historical Volcanism. Journal of Geophysical Research 87 (C2): 1231‚Äì1238. . . The earthquakes of 1 and 2 July The process creating the earthquakes of 1 and 2 July is considered to have been driven by the pressure caused by the rising magma super-heating water trapped within the edifice of the volcano.Day, S. J; Carracedo, J. C; Guillou, H. & Gravestock, P; 1999. Recent structural evolution of the Cumbre Vieja volcano, La Palma, Canary Islands: volcanic rift zone re-configuration as a precursor to flank instability. J. Volcanol. Geotherm Res. 94, 135‚Äì167. It is unlikely that the trapped waters could vapourise due to being under considerable pressure. What is postulated is that the waters were heated to a point where they could not absorb further thermal energy in the available space. Continuing heating required the water to expand further and the only way it could do so was to move the flank of the volcano. This caused the two earthquakes that were reported as occurring during the eruption along with the development of the crack. That the entrapped (within the edifice) water did not vapourise is shown by the absence of phreatomagmatic explosions except the mildly explosive eruptive activity that occurred at the Hoyo Negro vent from 12 to 22 July: steam escaping explosively from the ground is often a precursor of volcanic activity. Further evidence that vapourisation did not occur is that when Rubio Bonelli visited the rift the following day, the newly opened fissure \\"... Was not issuing fumes, vapour, steam, ashes, lava or other materials ...\\" In fact at no time during or after was steam or phreatomagmatic activity reported. This reinforces the claim that the waters trapped within the edifice never vapourised, which they would do if the pressure had fallen sufficiently to allow the super-heated water to flash into steam. Only at the Hoyo Negro did any phreatomagmatic activity occur. Unlike the northern sector of the island, the Cumbre Vieja is \\"dry.\\" Unlike the northern sector there are no water galleries, and it is therefore unlikely that the earthquake was caused ‚Äì as claimed by Day et al.; by water becoming superheated by rising magma. Research is continuing. Due to the lack of seismic monitoring equipment on the island ‚Äì apart from reports in the media, no record exists of any seismic activity that occurred pre-, syn- or post- eruption. Therefore, any claims about seismic activity are based upon personal observation and may not be reliable. =1971 eruption= The 1971 eruption occurred at the southern end of the Cumbre Vieja at the Tenegu√≠a vent. The eruption was mainly strombolian in style. Lava was also erupted. Seismic activity did occur before and during the 1971 eruption, but was not on the scale associated with the 1949 eruption. Residual thermal emissions continue. Future threats = Megatsunami = Satellite photo of La Palma, Canary Islands (north is in the lower right). The crater in the centre is the Caldera de Taburiente. The Cumbre Vieja is the ridge to the south (upper left) of the caldera and between them is the Cumbre Nueva. Day et al. (1999) indicated that the Cumbre Vieja may be in the initial stages of failure. The authors of the paper also claimed that the geological development of La Palma had undergone changes due to the southerly migration of the hotspot, and the collapse of the earlier volcanoes. Subsequent to this, a triple-arm rift system had evolved with the eventual closing down of volcanic activity associated with two of the arms ‚Äì the north- west and north-east rifts. The reasons can only be hypothesised. This caused the southern arm ‚Äì the Cumbre Vieja to be the sole source of volcanic activity. As a result, they postulated that the western flank may be in the initial stages of failure.

On 18 April 2013, the BBC transmitted a follow-up programme entitled Could we survive a Mega-Tsunami? The programme was presented in a \\"breaking news\\" reporting style. It painted a scenario in which the western flank of the Cumbre Vieja had collapsed and that the initial wave had an amplitude of about 1,000 metres. The programme used computer generated graphics to present a storyline that is based on a hypothesis.BBC 2 TV \\"Could we survive a Mega-Tsunami?\\" First screened 21:00, Thursday 18 April 2013. The programme interviewed several scientific personnel to give credence to the story. One scientist claimed, \\"This is a true story ‚Äì only it hasn't happened yet!\\" Day et al (1999), Ward and Day (2001)Ward, S. N; & Day, S. J; 2001.

Geophysics. 30, 38‚Äì44. hypothesize that, during an eruption at some future date, the western half of the Cumbre Vieja ‚Äî approximately 500 km3 (5 x 1011 m3) with an estimated mass of 1.5 trillion metric tons ‚Äî will catastrophically fail in a massive gravitational landslide and enter the Atlantic Ocean, generating a so-called mega-tsunami. The debris will continue to travel along the ocean floor as a debris flow. Computer modelling indicates that the resulting initial wave may attain a local amplitude (height) in excess of and an initial that approximates to , and travel at about (approximately the speed of a jet aircraft), inundating the African coast in about one hour, the southern coastlines of the British Isles in about 3.5 hours, and the eastern seaboard of North America in about six hours, by which time the initial wave will have subsided into a succession of smaller ones each about to high. These may surge to several hundred metres in height and be several kilometres apart while retaining their original speed. The models of Day et al; (1999), Ward and Day (2001), suggest that the event could inundate up to inland. If the model is correct, then this scale of inundation would greatly damage or destroy cities along the entire North American eastern seaboard, including Boston, New York City, Miami and many other cities near the Atlantic coast. =Criticism= There is controversy, however, about the threat presented by the Cumbre Vieja. Current indications are that recent landslides may have been gradual, and therefore may not generate tsunamis unless they increased in magnitude. Studies of possible local 'mega-tsunamis' in the Hawaiian Islands draw distinctions between the tsunami wave periods caused by landslides and subduction-zone earthquakes, arguing that a similar collapse in Hawaii would not endanger Asian or North American coastlines.Pararas-Carayannis, G; 2002.

They indicate that this collapse is the only plausible source, and also report that there is no indication that the tsunami propagated beyond Gran Canaria. These deposits date from between 32,000 and 1,750,000 years ago. Scientists at TU Delft in the Netherlands reported in 2006, that the section of the western flank of the Cumbre Vieja that was conjectured as potentially failing and falling into the Atlantic Ocean to create the hypothesised La Palma mega-tsunami was both too small in mass and volume, and far too stable to break away within the next 10,000 years.New Research Puts 'Killer La Palma Tsunami' At Distant Future, Science Daily, 21 September 2006, based on materials from the Delft University of Technology A 2008 paper looked into this very worst-case scenario, the most massive slide that could happen (though unlikely and probably impossible right now with the present day geology). They find wave heights in the range in the Canary Isles themselves. But the waves interfere and dissipate as they head out into the Atlantic. They predict a height of for some nearby island systems. For continents, the worst effects are in northern Brazil (), French Guiana (), Mid-Atlantic United States (), Western Sahara (largest prediction at ), and Mauritania (). This is not large enough to count as a megatsunami, with the highest prediction for Western Sahara comparable to the Japanese tsunami, so it would only be a megatsunami locally in the mid-Atlantic Ocean.L√∏vholt, F., G. Pedersen, and G. Gisler. \\"Oceanic propagation of a potential tsunami from the La Palma Island.\\" Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 113.C9 (2008). =2017 Seismic \\"crisis\\"= During October 2017, a series of low magnitude earthquakes were recorded on the west flank of the Cumbre Vieja near La Sabina Vieja. These were picked up by the media and almost immediately the headlines were proclaiming an imminent eruption amid fears that the Cumbre Vieja was on the verge of collapse. The fact that the earthquakes are centred on latitude (29.57229 N, ‚àí17.85701) at an average depth of ~, was conveniently ignored or mentioned in passing. Such earthquakes are undetectable except by specialist equipment and therefore at best may be the precursory activity for an eruption at some time in the future. = Historical \\"mega-tsunamis\\" = On 9 July 1958 a 7.9 magnitude earthquake and landslide released ~3.1 x 107 m3 of rock and debris in Crillon Inlet at the head of Lituya Bay, Alaska. The mass impacted the water with a force of ~8.8 x 1010 N m2 and this generated a massive plume and surge ‚Äì (which has since become known as the Lituya Bay 'mega-tsunami'), with an estimated initial height of about . As the water collapsed it generated a wave which then surged onto the headland opposite, rising to a height of approximately , stripping trees and soil from the headland as it flowed over the headland. As it flowed away from its origin it inundated the entire bay, destroyed two fishing boats, and damaged a third (by ripping its anchor from the housing within the boat), that were anchored there, killing two people. According to eye-witness accounts (Ulrich and son, reported in Miller 1960), the wave as it approached their fishing boat had an amplitude of about ~. Once the wave reached the open sea, however, it rapidly dissipated.Miller, D. J; 1960a. The Alaska earthquake of July 10, 1958: giant wave in Lituya Bay. Bull. Seismol. Soc.

It was the confining geography of Crillon Inlet and Lituya Bay that created the conditions that caused the initial impact plume to surge onto the headland opposite the impact site and this surge could only dissipate by moving away from the source‚Äîdown Lituya Bay where it was constrained by the narrow profile of the bay. It remains the highest recorded surge, but was not a tsunami nor a mega-tsunami, although some workers claimed it was; e.g., McGuire, in: BBC 2 TV. 2000. Transcript \\"Mega-tsunami; Wave of Destruction\\". Horizon. First screened 21.30, Thursday, 12 October 2000. On 9 October 1963, a mass of rock, soil, and other debris estimated at 2.6 x 108 m3, slid in a massive landslide off Monte Toc infilling the newly constructed Vajont Dam or Vaiont Dam in northeast Italy. It displaced ~3.0x107 m3‚Äîabout 1/5th of the water present in the reservoir‚Äîwhich surged over the dam wall and flooded the Piave Valley below the dam, killing over 2,000 people. From the onset of the landslide to impact on the opposite side of the gorge took an estimated 45 seconds, according to seismic records.Ward, S. N; & Day, S; 2011. The 1963 Landslide and Flood at Vaiont Reservoir, Italy. A tsunami ball simulation. Ital. J. Geosci. (Boll. Soc. Geol. It.), 130, 1. 16‚Äì26. By the definition of a tsunami the displacement and surge was not a tsunami, but rather a massive displacement of water with a resultant surge, it does serve to indicate how just like at Lituya Bay, massive volumes of debris can displace water. In the case of the disaster, the water behind the dam could only be displaced over the dam. Both the Lituya Bay and Vaiont Dam incidents are examples of how large volumes of debris may cause a rapid displacement of water when they suddenly enter a body of water in a restricted area. Because the surges were only able to dissipate by moving down the Bay or over the dam they do not serve as examples of mega-tsunami generation. From August 26 to August 27, 1883, the Indonesian volcanic island of Krakatoa, in the Sunda Strait, between the main Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra, exploded in a cataclysmic explosive VEI-6 eruption. Two-thirds of the island collapsed and slid into the ocean as the volcano erupted and literally ripped itself apart, and this generated a 100-foot-high tsunami which devastated local areas and destroyed a lighthouse in the town of Anyer. It carried a Dutch naval vessel, Barouw, inland for over 5 km and left it stranded about 20 m above sea level. The tsunami itself did not propagate over trans-oceanic distances. What was noted on tide gauges around the world are considered to be the effect of the atmospheric pressure wave. During the second millennium BC, the Thera volcano on Santorini exploded with a VEI estimated at 7. Research suggests that the eruption generated a tsunami which inundated Crete, possibly triggering the downfall of the Minoan civilization. Lateral collapse events at stratovolcanoes, similar to the current threat posed by the western flank of Cumbre Vieja, could increase due to the physical effects of global warming on the Earth from increases in deviatoric stress from post-glacial rebound, while the size and frequency of eruptions are also likely to increase. In the past, smaller volcanic island flank collapses have created waves not large enough to be considered megatsunamis, but still large enough to cause major damage. Examples are Ritter Island in 1888 and Anak Krakatau in 2018.

It was effectively part of an attempt by the Great Eastern Railway to obtain a west end terminus to complement Bishopsgate railway station in east London. The line opened on 21 July 1868 between Tottenham North Junction (on the Great Eastern Railway) and Highgate Road. An extension to Kentish Town opened in 1870. An extension to Gospel Oak opened on 4 June 1888.Gospel Oak to Barking Line User Group: History of the Barking to Gospel Oak line  History  Aerial view by Cecil Shadbolt, showing Seven Sisters Curve, part of the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway, taken from on 29 May 1892 - the earliest extant aerial photograph taken in the British Isles. Even before it opened, the line had problems. Plans to extend the western end of this line via a proposed 'London Main Trunk Railway', underneath Hampstead Road, the Metropolitan Railway (modern Circle line) and Tottenham Court Road, to Charing Cross were rejected by Parliament in 1864.Hansard: RAILWAY SCHEMES (METROPOLIS). REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE Instead it was decided to terminate the line at Gospel Oak. The line opened in 1868 with the Great Eastern Railway operating a service between Highgate Road and Fenchurch Street via Tottenham.Hornsey, including Highgate: Communications', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 6: Friern Barnet, Finchley, Hornsey with Highgate (1980), pp. 103-107. Date accessed: 14 February 2009. With a very indirect route into central London at one end and no interchange at all at the other, the service was a commercial failure and the planned link to Gospel Oak was never completed. The service ceased operation entirely in January 1870 and a local act was passed in August abandoning the railway in its original form.Hansard: Local Acts 10 August 1870 During 1870, a branch was constructed to Kentish Town and the line reopened as part of the Midland Railway in October, initially running between Moorgate and Crouch Hill via Kentish Town. In 1872 this was extended to South Tottenham & Stamford Hill. This provided an interchange with the Palace Gates Line. A number of new stations were opened, many of them close to existing stations. Most of these were closed in the 1940s. In 1888, the line was extended to Gospel Oak (as originally planned) although the Kentish Town branch remained the primary route and the Gospel Oak link was abandoned in 1926. In 1894 the Tottenham & Forest Gate Railway opened and the service was extended east of South Tottenham & Stamford Hill to Barking and, occasionally, beyond. In 1901, a bill was passed authorising the widening of the railway and other improvements.Hansard: Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway Bill 1901 This was followed by a bill in 1902 which gave the Great Eastern and Midland railways joint ownership of the line.Hansard: Midland Railway Bill 1902 The line, along with the rest of Britain's railways, was nationalised in 1948 and became part of British Rail. In 1981, the Kentish Town branch was closed and the link to Gospel Oak reinstated. For more recent history see the Gospel Oak to Barking line.  Stations  The line had the following stations (listed from east to west using the original station names): *Tottenham (existing, service abandoned 1870) *Branch: :*South Tottenham & Stamford Hill (existing) (added 1872, replacing Tottenham) [now called 'South Tottenham'] *St Ann's Road (new) (opened 1882, closed 1942) *Green Lanes (new) (opened 1880) [now called 'Harringay Green Lanes'] *Crouch Hill (new) *Hornsey Road (new) (opened 1872, closed 1943) *Upper Holloway (new) *Junction Road (new) (opened 1872, closed 1943) *Branch: :*Highgate Road {Low Level} (new) (opened 1900, closed 1918) :*Kentish Town (existing, added 1870, abandoned 1981) *Highgate Road {High Level} (new) (closed 1915) *Gospel Oak (existing, added 1888, abandoned 1926, added again 1981)  Current status  The branch to Kentish Town closed in 1981, cut off by the Thameslink electrification project.

It runs in a roughly north‚Äìsouth direction for through the southwestern and central parts of Amherst from an interchange with I-290 north of Buffalo to an intersection with New York State Route 263 (NY 263, named Millersport Highway) south of Lockport. The highway serves as a connection between Buffalo, the University at Buffalo, and Lockport (via NY 263 and NY 78). Like I-590 in nearby Rochester, I-990 does not physically meet I-90, its parent Interstate Highway; instead, the highway makes the connection by way of a \\"sibling\\" highway (I-290). I-990 is the highest numbered Interstate Highway in the United States. Plans for an expressway between Buffalo and Lockport were proposed as early as the late 1960s. As originally laid out, the highway would run for and end in Lockport's eastern suburbs. By the time the road was added to the Interstate Highway System and designated I-990 in 1979, the proposal had been scaled back to a freeway linking I-290 to North French Road. The route was constructed and opened to traffic in two stages during the 1980s. An extension to NY 263 was finished in 1990 and officially added to I-990 three years later. Route description I-990 northbound from the Amherst pedestrian bridge I-990 begins at a semi-directional T interchange (exit 4) with I-290 (the Youngmann Expressway) in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst. After leaving the interchange, I-990, known as the Lockport Expressway, proceeds northward along the western edge of the University at Buffalo's Amherst Campus as a four-lane divided expressway. It generally parallels Sweet Home Road (unsigned NY 952T) to exit 1, a northbound-only interchange providing access to Audubon Parkway by way of a two-lane connector to the campus. From here, I-990 gradually bends northeastward, leaving the vicinity of the campus and entering a partial cloverleaf interchange (exit 2) connecting to Sweet Home Road. The Interstate Highway continues to turn to the northeast as it heads away from exit 2, crossing over Ellicott Creek and Dodge Road (County Route 45 or CR 45). I-990 expands to six lanes just as it enters the nearby exit 3, which connects to Dodge Road and the northern end of the Audubon Parkway. The freeway briefly runs eastward from the junction, paralleling Dodge Road into the hamlet of Getzville, where the expressway passes over NY 270 (Campbell Boulevard). Just after the NY 270 crossing, I-990 bends northward once again and enters exit 4, a diamond interchange with North French Road (CR 299). Past North French Road, I-990 bends back to the northeast, crossing Hopkins Road (CR 87) as it approaches an at-grade intersection with NY 263 (Millersport Highway). The junction serves as I-990's exit 5 and its northern terminus. Traffic approaching the junction on northbound I-990 is diverted onto what was intended to be a single-lane exit ramp leading to NY 263\\\\. A small stub of highway exists east of the exit gore. History Interstate 990's northern terminus, featuring the incomplete stub at NY 263, seen from the Hopkins Road overpass On October 30, 1968, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) nominated 20 proposed highways to be added to the Interstate Highway System as part of a nationwide system expansion authorized by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. One of the submitted roads was the Lockport Expressway, a , $22 million limited-access highway extending in a northeast‚Äìsouthwest direction between I-290 north of Buffalo and a proposed Niagara Falls‚ÄìRochester freeway near Lockport. When the city of Niagara Falls released its Regional Highway Plan for the Buffalo‚ÄìNiagara Falls area in 1971, the Niagara Falls‚ÄìRochester highway was scrapped; as a result, the north end of the Lockport Expressway was moved to a point on NY 31 east of Lockport. In between I-290 and NY 31, the highway would intersect the proposed Belt Expressway and NY 78 (Transit Road). While the outer belt proposal was mostly dropped, the plans to build the Lockport Expressway gained traction in January 1979 when the portion between I-290 and North French Road was added to the Interstate Highway System and designated as I-990. The remainder of the original 12-mile route was excluded due to a lack of funding. Construction began in 1980 on the part south of Sweet Home Road, and the highway was opened to traffic by 1985. The section leading northeast to North French Road was built during the mid-1980s and completed by 1990. In 1986, NYSDOT began to evaluate ways to improve the highways surrounding the northern terminus of I-990. One of the potential options was an extension of the freeway to NY 263 (Millersport Highway) southwest of Lockport. This option was ultimately selected, and the new section of the freeway was opened to traffic on December 21, 1990. It was officially added to I-990 on October 22, 1993. In June 2013, Interstate 990 was renamed from the Lockport Expressway to the Staff Sergeant William R. Wilson III Memorial Highway. This is in honor of his contributions to the United States Military, which included training Afghan soldiers and police to take over the country's security. Staff Sergeant Wilson also served two combat deployments to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. As a result, he was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. He also received the National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, as well as the Army Service Ribbon and Overseas Service Ribbon. The bill to rename Interstate 990 was sponsored by State Senator Michael Ranzenhofer and Assemblyman Raymond Walter. Signage is now displayed at each terminus showing the new name.

Griqualand East's capital, Kokstad, was the final place of settlement for a people who had migrated several times on their journey from the Cape of Good Hope and over the mountains of present-day Lesotho. The territory was occupied by the British Empire and became a colony in 1874, shortly before the death of its founder and only leader, Adam Kok III. A short while later, the small territory was incorporated into the neighbouring Cape Colony.

As Faku eventually realised that his warriors could not defend the eastern part of his kingdom against Shaka, he decided to evacuate the area, leaving behind what became known as Nomansland (often spelled \\"No-man's land\\" in contemporary sources).Nature. Illustrated Journal of Science. Vol. LXXII. Sept 1905. p473 Meanwhile, a group of Griquas who had left the Cape of Good Hope in the 18th century and had settled in the area around present-day Philippolis in 1826 faced the prospect of their area coming under the control of the emerging Orange Free State (Oranje Vrijstaat - officially established as a Boer republic in 1854).History of Kokstad , Greater Kokstad Municipality website. Accessed 2009-07-31. In 1861 most of these inhabitants embarked on a tiresome and exhausting journey, leaving to move southwards over Ukhahlamba' also called intaba zokhahlamba that means mountains of Ukhahlamba (today known as the Drakensberg mountain range), but first-hand witnesses give two differing narratives of the reasons and motivations for their last trek. =Arrival and settlement= Griqua and Boer states in Southern Africa, 19th century. According to the account of John Robinson, first Premier of Natal, the inhabitants of Philippolis were invited by Sir George Grey, administrator of the area on behalf of the United Kingdom, to settle in the aforementioned Nomansland, south of what had by then become the British Colony of Natal. Their settlement there was to avoid a potential conflict with the Free State and simultaneously serve as a buffer against Bushmen and \\"their predatory raids upon the farmers and natives of Natal\\"Robinson, John.

Cape Town:2004. p102 The British agreed to expel the entire population in exchange for a settlement of a border conflict between the Afrikaners and the Cape colonists. According to the sources, Adam Kok III and his followers only learned about the plans six years after the official document had been secretly signed. Realising that they could not muster a fighting-force that could match the colonial army, and after having voiced their opposition to becoming either subjects to the Crown in the Cape Colony or servants in the Free State, they were forcibly removed into exile in 1863.Lucas, Charles Prestwood et al. A historical geography of the British colonies. Vol IV: South and East Africa. London: Clarendon Press, 1900. p. 186 Ultimately, all sources agree that the last great Griqua leader's followers ended up in the area around Mount Currie and set up a Laager, a simple settlement site made up of small huts, where they remained for over half a decade. In 1869, Reverend Dower of the London Mission Society visited the place and agreed to establish a church if the people were to move once more. Kok consulted with the populace, and they chose an area farther south of the mountain. The Griquas moved there in 1872, and founded the town of Kokstad, named in honour of their leader. The state that was established around Kokstad, while Griqua ruled, was populated overwhelmingly by the pre- existing Xhosa speaking peoples, with the Griqua forming only a very small, politically-dominant minority.Mountain, A.

Local Cape sources record an official (but heavily qualified) request in 1869, from Adam Kok III, for British administration, on condition that land title be respected and that Griqualand East should under no circumstances be incorporated into the Colony of Natal. British sources also claim that the Griquas then sold much of their land voluntarily, and that the overall annexation of the territory took place \\"at the wish of the inhabitants themselves.\\"Rudler, F.W. (ed). The British Colonies and Dependencies. Longman's geographical reading books. Spottiswoode & Co. London:1885. p114 On the other hand, opinion among the Griqua people themselves seems to have been divided. A quote by Adam Kok III, upon learning of the United Kingdom's plans, suggests that there was misunderstanding or even deception involved in the British takeover: \\"There you have it... we were not consulted. We can say nothing.\\" The British assumed direct control of the territory in 1874. What is known for a fact is that the Griqua leader, whose name still adorns the town he founded, died in December 1875 after being severely injured in a wagon- accident. At his funeral, his cousin commented that with Kok's death, the Griquas' last hope for an independent state in Southern Africa had died as well. After coming under British rule, Griqualand East was administered by the British as a separate colony for several years. During this time, the British Colonial Office put considerable pressure on the government of the neighbouring Cape Colony to annexe the costly and turbulent territory. However the Cape, newly under Responsible Government, was reluctant to assume responsibility for Griqualand East due to its considerable expenses and its understandably resentful population.P. A.

London:July/October 1886. p179 The act was only promulgated two years later on 17 September 1879, when four magistrates were set up, at Kokstad, Matatiele, Mount Frere and Umzimkulu. The territory was also given two elected seats in the Cape Parliament, which at the time was elected through the multi- racial \\"Cape Qualified Franchise\\" system, whereby qualifications for suffrage were applied to all males, regardless of race.Scottish Geographical Magazine. Royal Scottish Geographical Society. Edinburgh:1886. p480 The Griqua people had only ever been a small, ruling minority of the population of Griqualand East. Once independent Griqua rule was ended, the Xhosa speaking Pondo people, who had long constituted the majority of the Griqualand East population, came to own increasing amounts of land in the area, together with newly-arriving European settlers. These demographic factors led to a further dilution of Griqua identity and a century later, under Apartheid, the territory was incorporated into the Xhosa \\"homeland\\" of the Transkei.J.S.

Contemporary Griqualand When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the Cape Colony changed its name to \\"Cape Province,\\" and during the 1980s, part of former Griqualand East was partitioned off into the Transkei, one of the four nominally independent Bantustans. In 1994, shortly before the first all- inclusive elections, it was incorporated into the southern part of the KwaZulu-Natal province. Kokstad retained its name and is today one of the main cities of the Harry Gwala District Municipality.Bergh, J.S., and J.C. Visagie.

It is a binary star system, with the secondary star being a red dwarf. As of 1999, an extrasolar planet has been confirmed to be orbiting the primary star. Stellar components The system is a binary. The primary component is a yellow-white dwarf (spectral type F7 V) and secondary is a dim red dwarf (spectral type M2 V). The system is relatively nearby, distance being about 51 light years. The primary star should be easily visible to the unaided eye under dark skies. The primary star, Tau Bo√∂tis A is a yellow-white dwarf. It is 40 percent more massive than the Sun and thus is somewhat brighter and hotter. It has a radius 1.4 times solar, and is probably about 1.3 billion years old. Since it is more massive than the Sun, its lifespan is shorter ‚Äì less than 6 billion years. Tau Bootis is the first star apart from the sun to be observed changing the polarity of its magnetic field. It is also listed as a suspected variable star. The magnetic activity cycle for this star shows a period of 122 days ‚àí much shorter than the solar cycle. Tau Bo√∂tis B (with a capital B, as opposed to the planet) is a dim red dwarf orbiting the primary star at a distance of 220 AU. One orbit around the primary would take approximately two and a half thousand years to complete. Planetary system In 1996 the planet Tau Bo√∂tis b was discovered orbiting the primary star by a team of astronomers led by R. Paul Butler. There are also some indications of another planet orbiting the star with a period of roughly 5000 days; however, this could be due to an instrumental effect or a stellar magnetic activity cycle. In an unusual case of role-reversal, it appears that Tau Bo√∂tis's rotation has been tidally locked to Tau Bo√∂tis b. The planet and its host star was one of the planetary systems selected by the International Astronomical Union as part of their public process for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host star (where no proper name already exists). The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names, and the IAU announced the new names in mid-December 2015. However, the IAU annulled the vote for the system, as the winning names (\\"Shri Ram Matt\\" for the star and \\"Bhagavatidevi\\" for the planet) were judged not to conform with the IAU rules for naming exoplanets. The names garnered the majority of the votes cast for the system, and also making up a significant proportion of all votes cast as part of the contest.

It takes place between The Robots of Dawn and Robots and Empire. Each volume is complete in itself, but they form a continuing series. The novels were written in response to a writing challenge issued by Asimov to write a series involving the Three Laws of Robotics, which brought about a collaboration of several authors. Asimov provided outlines for stories which filled in the gap between Asimov's own robot stories and his Foundation series, explaining the disappearance of the robots prior to the establishment of the galactic empire. Isaac Asimov's Robots and Aliens followed in this series, with the same protagonists and many other characters. The common theme of all books of both series is the interaction between the characters and autonomous cities run and populated by robots (the \\"robot cities\\" of the series title). Robot City was also released as a mystery game for the PC in 1995. The player takes the role of Derec. Robot City The Robot City novels begin revolving around a man who has no memory of who he was, but believes he might be called Derec after a name-badge he is wearing. Derec journeys to Robot City, a city of robots, with a handful of transient humans. There, Derec meets another mysterious person calling herself Katherine, whose real name turns out to be Ariel, and together the two disprove their role in the apparent murder of a human whose identity is not known by the robots. Fleeing an increasingly dangerous Robot City, Derec and Ariel journey to Earth to find the city's creator, the insane Dr. Avery and learn their true identities. As the series goes on, Both Ariel and Derec are repeatedly asked to confront more questions as old ones are answered, all of which, no matter how broad, always seem to connect with Robot City. The series makes much use of the Three Laws of Robotics and their interpretations and interactions when dealing with obscure scenarios, such as levels or priority in conflicting orders, a human brain in a robot body, and do the laws apply to non-human, but sentient beings. It also addresses, in passing, differences in interpretation of the First Law, namely, the difference between physical harm and psychological harm. :# Odyssey by Michael P.

Dicynodonts were herbivorous animals with two tusks, hence their name, which means 'two dog tooth'. They are also the most successful and diverse of the non-mammalian therapsids, with over 70 genera known, varying from rat- to elephant-sized. Characteristics Dicynodont fossils Diictodon. Life-sized model The dicynodont skull is highly specialised, light but strong, with the synapsid temporal openings at the rear of the skull greatly enlarged to accommodate larger jaw muscles. The front of the skull and the lower jaw are generally narrow and, in all but a number of primitive forms, toothless. Instead, the front of the mouth is equipped with a horny beak, as in turtles and ceratopsian dinosaurs. Food was processed by the retraction of the lower jaw when the mouth closed, producing a powerful shearing action, which would have enabled dicynodonts to cope with tough plant material. Many genera also have a pair of tusks, which it is thought may have been an example of sexual dimorphism.Colbert, E. H., (1969), Evolution of the Vertebrates, John Wiley & Sons Inc (2nd ed.), p. 137 The body is short, strong and barrel-shaped, with strong limbs. In large genera (such as Dinodontosaurus) the hindlimbs were held erect, but the forelimbs bent at the elbow. Both the pectoral girdle and the ilium are large and strong. The tail is short. =Endothermy and hair= Dicynodonts have long been suspected of being warm-blooded animals. Their bones are highly vascularised and possess Haversian canals, and their bodily proportions are conducive to heat preservation. In young specimens, the bones are so highly vascularised that they exhibit higher channel densities than most other therapsids. Yet, studies on Late Triassic dicynodont coprolites paradoxically showcase digestive patterns more typical of animals with slow metabolisms. More recently, the discovery of hair remnants in Permian coprolites possibly vindicates the status of dicynodonts as endothermic animals. As these coprolites come from carnivorous species and digested dicynodont bones are abundant, it has been suggested that at least some of these hair remnants come from dicynodont prey. A new chemical study seemed to suggest that cynodonts and dicynodonts both developed warm blood independently before the Permian extinction using chemical analysis. =Feet= Pentasauropus dicynodont tracks suggest that dicynodonts had fleshy pads on their feet. History An illustration of the skull of Dicynodon lacerticeps, first published in an 1845 description by Richard Owen Dicynodonts have been known since the mid-1800s. The South African geologist Andrew Geddes Bain gave the first description of dicynodonts in 1845. At the time, Bain was a supervisor for the construction of military roads under the Corps of Royal Engineers and had found many reptilian fossils during his surveys of South Africa. Bain described these fossils in an 1845 letter published in Transactions of the Geological Society of London, calling them \\"bidentals\\" for their two prominent tusks. In that same year, the English paleontologist Richard Owen named two species of dicynodonts from South Africa: Dicynodon lacerticeps and Dicynodon bainii. Since Bain was preoccupied with the Corps of Royal Engineers, he wanted Owen to describe his fossils more extensively. Owen did not publish a description until 1876 in his Descriptive and Illustrated Catalogue of the Fossil Reptilia of South Africa in the Collection of the British Museum. By this time, many more dicynodonts had been described. In 1859, another important species called Ptychognathus declivis was named from South Africa. A year later, in 1860, Owen named the group Dicynodontia. In his Descriptive and Illustrated Catalogue, Owen honored Bain by erecting Bidentalia as a replacement name for his Dicynodontia. The name Bidentalia quickly fell out of use in the following years, replaced by popularity of Owen's Dicynodontia. Evolutionary history Eodicynodon, a primitive dicynodont from the middle Permian of South Africa Dicynodonts first appeared during the Middle Permian, and underwent a rapid evolutionary radiation, becoming the most successful and abundant land vertebrates of the Late Permian. During this time, they included a large variety of ecotypes, including large, medium-sized, and small herbivores and short-limbed mole-like burrowers. Lisowicia, a giant dicynodont from Late Triassic Poland Only four lineages are known to have survived the Great Dying; the first three represented with a single genus each: Myosaurus, Kombuisia, and Lystrosaurus, the latter being the most common and widespread herbivores of the Induan (earliest Triassic). None of these survived long into the Triassic. The fourth group was the Kannemeyeriiformes, the only dicynodonts who diversified during the Triassic. These stocky, pig- to ox-sized animals were the most abundant herbivores worldwide from the Olenekian to the Ladinian age. By the Carnian they had been supplanted by traversodont cynodonts and rhynchosaur reptiles. During the Norian (middle of the Late Triassic), perhaps due to increasing aridity, they drastically declined, and the role of large herbivores was taken over by sauropodomorph dinosaurs. Fossils of an Asian elephant-sized dicynodont Lisowicia bojani discovered in Poland indicate that dicynodonts survived at least until the late Norian or earliest Rhaetian (latest Triassic); this animal was also the largest known dicynodont species. Six fragments of fossil bone discovered in Queensland, Australia, were interpreted as remains of a skull in 2003. This suggested to indicate that dicynodonts survived into the Cretaceous in southern Gondwana. The dicynodont affinity of these specimens was questioned (including a proposal that they belonged to a baurusuchian crocodyliform by Agnolin et al. in 2010), and in 2019 Knutsen and Oerlemans considered this fossil to be of Plio-Pleistocene age, and reinterpreted it as a fossil of a large mammal, probably a diprotodontid. Lisowice) With the decline and extinction of the kannemeyerids, there were to be no more dominant large synapsid herbivores until the middle Paleocene epoch (60 Ma) when mammals, distant descendants of cynodonts, began to diversify after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. Systematics =Taxonomy= Dicynodontia was originally named by the English paleontologist Richard Owen. It was erected as a family of the order Anomodontia and included the genera Dicynodon and Ptychognathus. Other groups of Anomodontia included Gnathodontia, which included Rhynchosaurus (now known to be an archosauromorph) and Cryptodontia, which included Oudenodon. Cryptodonts were distinguished from dicynodonts from their absence of tusks. Although it lacks tusks, Oudenodon is now classified as a dicynodont, and the name Cryptodontia is no longer used. Thomas Henry Huxley revised Owen's Dicynodontia as an order that included Dicynodon and Oudenodon. Dicynodontia was later ranked as a suborder or infraorder with the larger group Anomodontia, which is classified as an order. The ranking of Dicynodontia has varied in recent studies, with Ivakhnenko (2008) considering it a suborder, Ivanchnenko (2008) considering it an infraorder, and Kurkin (2010) considering it an order. Many higher taxa, including infraorders and families, have been erected as a means of classifying the large number of dicynodont species. Cluver and King (1983) recognised several main groups within Dicynodontia, including Diictodontia, Endothiodontia, Eodicynodontia, Kingoriamorpha, Pristerodontia, and Venyukoviamorpha. Many families have been proposed, including Cistecephalidae, Diictodontidae, Dicynodontae, Emydopidae, Endothiodontidae, Kannemeyeriidae, Kingoriidae, Lystrosauridae, Myosauridae, Oudenodontidae, Pristerodontidae, and Robertiidae. However, with the rise of phylogenetics, most of these taxa are no longer considered valid. Kammerer and Angielczyk (2009) suggested that the problematic taxonomy and nomenclature of Dicynodontia and other groups results from the large number of conflicting studies and the tendency for invalid names to be mistakenly established.

Its mandate ended in December 1994. Mandate and Strength ONUMOZ' mandate was: *To monitor and verify the ceasefire, the separation and concentration of forces, their demobilization and the collection, storage and destruction of weapons; *To monitor and verify the complete withdrawal of foreign forces and to provide security in the transport corridors; *To monitor and verify the disbanding of private and irregular armed groups; *To authorize security arrangements for vital infrastructures and to provide security for United Nations and other international activities in support of the peace process; *To provide technical assistance and monitor the entire electoral process; *To coordinate and monitor humanitarian assistance operations, in particular those relating to refugees, internally displaced persons, demobilized military personnel and the affected local population. In order to accomplish its mission ONUMOZ had an authorised strength of 6.625 troops and military support personnel, 354 military observers, 1.144 civil police officers, 355 international staff, 506 local staff and 900 election observers. Performance The bulk of ONUMOZ troops under the command of Secretary-General's Special Representative Aldo Ajello was deployed in early 1993. Initially, ONUMOZ faced significant resistance carrying out its mission. Due to distrust among the conflict parties, the collection of weapons could only begin as late in November 1993 following a visit of the UN Secretary General and a further resolution of the UN Security Council (United Nations Security Council Resolution 882). Thus the original schedule which had aimed for elections in October 1993 could not be met. Despite of these obstacles the mission was a success with the holding of general, free elections on 13 October 1994. ONUMOZ's mandate expired with the swearing in of president Joaquim Chissano and the newly elected parliament and the mission was liquidated in January 1995. Prior to this, ONUMOZ had disarmed some 76,000 fighters, collected 155,000 firearms, helped train 10,000 soldiers of the new Mozambican Armed Forces (FADM) and helped repatriating most of the five million refugees and internally displaced people uprooted by the civil war. In doing so it had suffered 26 casualties. The mission cost US $492.6 million and an additional $616 million was spent on humanitarian aid.

(German: k√∂niglich ungarisch), both meaning \\"Royal Hungarian\\", was applied in reference to the governmental bodies of the Kingdom of Hungary (Transleithania). In official documents, the abbreviation used provides information on the lands targeted: * k.k. or k.-k., meaning \\"imperial (Austria) ‚Äì royal (Bohemia)\\", pertains to the Austrian Empire before 1867 and to the Austrian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867‚Äì1918 * k.u.k., meaning \\"imperial (Austria) and royal (Hungary)\\", pertains to the Austro- Hungarian Empire 1867‚Äì1918  Other uses  The ubiquity of this phrase in all administrative matters made it a synonym for the Habsburg administration, sometimes referred to as the \\"k. u. k. monarchy\\" in Central European publications through the present. Other languages of the Habsburg Monarchy retained the German abbreviation or used it interchangeably with their own ‚àí c. i kr. in Croatian, c. a k. or c.-k. in Czech, cs. √©s kir. in Hungarian, I.R. in Italian, c. i k. or C.K. in Polish, often hyphenated (cezaro-crƒÉiesc) in Romanian, c. a k. in Slovak, c. kr. in Slovenian. The abbreviation k.k. gave rise to the noun Kakania (spelling out the letter K [kah] twice as well as reminiscent of caca in the Central European languages). It was intended to describe the Habsburg Monarchy as a state of mind, bureaucratic and with a highly stratified formal society. A discussion of Kakania became a highlight of the first volume of Robert Musil's novel The Man Without Qualities (1930).

He was also in the music groups Alaska y los Pegamoides and Alaska y Dinarama together with Carlos Berlanga and Alaska. He started his career with Kaka de Luxe in 1977, one of the first punk bands in Spain. Later, along with Berlanga and Alaska, Nacho Canut formed Alaska y los Pegamoides with Ana Curra and Eduardo Benavente. Alaska y los Pegamoides would become one of the cornerstones of La Movida Madrile√±a countercultural movement and an important influence for many Spanish punk bands. The name of the band was adopted along the line of Siouxsie and the Banshees (an important and recognizable influence in his music). With this band, Canut achieved hits like \\"Horror en el Hipermercado\\", \\"Bote de Col√≥n\\", \\"Llegando Hasta el Final\\" and \\"Bailando\\" (which became an international hit). Songs by Alaska y los Pegamoides appeared in 1982 under the title Grandes Exitos (Hispavox). After the dissolution of Alaska y los Pegamoides in 1982, Canut, Berlanga and Alaska formed one of the most successful bands of the Spanish eighties, Alaska y Dinarama. Alaska y Dinarama became one of the first glam bands in Spain. Some of the finest songs ever written in the history of modern Spanish music have been composed by Canut and Berlanga. Among them, \\"Ni t√∫ ni nadie\\" and \\"¬øA qui√©n le importa?\\" became hymns for the LGBT Spanish movement, other hits include the massively successful songs, \\"Mi novio es un zombie\\", \\"Quiero ser santa\\" and \\"Descong√©late\\". When Carlos Berlanga left the band, Nacho Canut and Alaska formed a new band, Fangoria in 1989. This band represented a turn from rock to techno-pop, though the rock influence is still felt in certain songs. With this band, he has published nine studio albums, from Salto Mortal (1990) to Absolutamente (2009). Many of his songs have appeared in films like Mondays in the Sun, La Lengua Asesina, Sex and Lucia and Descong√©late.

Alaska, main vocals, occasional guitar), and Nacho Canut (keyboards, occasional bass guitar). Fangoria have sold 1 million records worldwide since 1989. History In 1977 Alaska, along with Nacho Canut and Carlos Berlanga, formed the band Alaska y los Pegamoides. Later, in 1982, they changed the name to Alaska y Dinarama. The group was popular and influential during La Movida Madrile√±a. Some of their famous recordings include A quien le importa and Ni t√∫ ni nadie. The latter was entered for the Spanish heats of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1985 and later covered by the Mexican group M≈ìnia in 2004 and by the Puerto Rican band Circo in 2005. Their ¬øA qui√©n le importa? also was later covered by Mexican pop musician Thal√≠a in 2002. In 1989 Carlos Berlanga left, and the band transformed once again, this time adopting the name of the American horror film magazine Fangoria. They had already made clear their fascination with American z-movies, with songs like Mi novio es un Zombi (My Boyfriend Is A Zombie) and La rebeli√≥n de los electrodom√©sticos (The Rebellion of the Household Appliances). With each name change, the band moved further away from punk and further embraced electropop, although strong guitars have generally always been present in their performances. Since the birth of Fangoria in 1990, Alaska and Nacho Canut have recorded and launched several albums, always in the dance-pop electronica pattern. Some of their best-known songs include * En la Disneylandia del amor (1993) * No s√© qu√© me das (2001) * Eternamente inocente (2001) * Retorciendo palabras (2004) * Miro la vida pasar (2004) * Absolutamente (2009) * Dramas y comedias (2013) * Fiesta en el infierno (2016) Moreover, Hombres and Me Odio Cuando Miento were featured in 2004 movie Cachorro. Their lyrics typically revolve around sadness, loneliness, jealousy and desire: these tragic contents usually contrast with the music, which normally is up-tempo and disco-oriented, although they have recorded downtempo songs as well. Some of their singles have been remixed by Marc Almond (formerly of Soft Cell) and Vive la F√™te. In 2009, they released their tenth studio album Absolutamente; the first single M√°s es M√°s was released before the release of the album. Later they released the second single, La Peque√±a Edad de Hielo. More recently, in 2010, a set of three CDs came out titled El Paso Trascendental Del Vodevil A La Astracanada. This release consists of Fangoria's greatest hits and rare recordings, as well as 15 completely re-made versions of their older hits from their previous bands, such as Bailando, A qui√©n le importa, Ni t√∫ ni nadie or Perlas ensangrentadas.

Placerias belongs to a group of dicynodonts called Kannemeyeriiformes, which was the last known group of dicynodonts before dicynodonts became extinct at the end of the Triassic.  Description  P. hesternus compared to a human Placerias was one of the largest herbivores in the Late Triassic, measuring up to long and weighing up to a tonne (1000 kilograms) with a powerful neck, strong legs, and a barrel-shaped body. There are possible ecological and evolutionary parallels with the modern hippopotamus, spending much of its time during the wet season wallowing in the water, chewing at bankside vegetation. Remaining in the water would also have given Placerias some protection against land-based predators such as Postosuchus. Placerias used its beak to slice through thick branches and roots with two short tusks that could be used for defence and for intra-specific display. Placerias was closely related to Ischigualastia and similar in appearance.  Discovery  Restoration of a herd Fossils of forty Placerias were found near St. Johns, southeast of the Petrified Forest in the Chinle Formation of Arizona. This site has become known as the 'Placerias Quarry' and was discovered in 1930, by Charles Camp and Samuel Welles, of the University of California, Berkeley. Sedimentological features of the site indicate a low-energy depositional environment, possibly flood-plain or overbank. Bones are associated mostly with mudstones and a layer that contains numerous carbonate nodules. It is also known from the Pekin Formation of North Carolina. Placerias was originally considered the last of the Dicynodonts until fossil finds from Queensland were reported in 2003 to have revealed that the Dicynodonts survived until the Early Cretaceous. Agnolin et al. (2010) called for a reconsideration of that Australian specimen, noting its similarity to baurusuchian crocodyliforms such as Baurusuchus pachecoi.

South of Brabrand, in the Aarhus river-valley, is the largest recreational area of Aarhus Municipality, comprising the Brabrand Lake and the meadow-lake of √Örslev, with surrounding natural sites.  History  Brabrand was originally a village 6‚Äì9 km west of Aarhus, founded in the 18th century, by clearing the land by forest burning (the Danish name reflects this), and its economy was initially based on farming and associated trades. The village became a suburb of Aarhus in 1970 and has now completely merged with the city.  Description  The district of Brabrand is located outside the ring road of Ring 2 and comprise four distinct areas: The old town in the south by the lake, mainly made up of single-family houses. A modern housing area in the west, with a mix of single-family houses and low multi-family houses. An industrial park around the road of Edwin Rahrs Vej in the north, and finally the modernist suburban residential area of Gellerup in the east. The more affluent western part of Brabrand was expanded recently in 2005, with the new residential area of Helenelyst further west. Helenelyst is a mix of modern one-family houses, two- family houses, and 3 story houses, built to accommodate slightly richer middle-class families. The neighbourhood of Gellerup stands out as an architectural example of the former urban development style, built around several Danish cities in the 1960s. Gellerup is known as a multinational district, where the Middle East is highly represented, also exemplified in the big middle-eastern inspired shopping mall of Bazar Vest. In the southeast of Gellerup, next to the busy Silkeborg Highway, is the shopping mall of CityVest, one of the largest in Denmark. Along with the retail and service sectors, a number of multi-national companies have a presence in Brabrand.  Attractions  Brabrand is home to several natural and recreational sites, attracting citizens from all over Aarhus. This includes the Brabrand Lake and the √Örslev meadow-lake in the south, connected with the city centre of Aarhus by the pathway of Brabrandstien; the newly raised woodland of Gellerup Skov in the southeast; Skjoldh√∏jkilen in the north; the valley of Langdalen in the west and the forests of √Örslev Skov and True Skov also in the west. Brabrand has several important sports facilities, such as the rowing stadium at the Brabrand Lake, the new sports and community centre of Globus1 at Gellerup, opportunities for mountainbiking, green exercise and motocross in Skjoldh√∏jkilen, in addition to many small-scale regular sports facilities like tennis courts, soccer fields, a swimminghall, boxing and martial arts clubs, etc.. Brabrand houses one of the few remaining dolmens in the greater Aarhus area. Most of the dolmens in Aarhus, have been demolished long time ago, but what is left is now regarded as special relics of the past to be protected and valued in the landscape, wherever they might be located. The dolmen is called √Örslev Dyssen (lit.: The √Örslev Dolmen) and is dated to have been constructed in the Stone Age, when the first agricultural societies emerged in Scandinavia around 6,000 years ago. Until 1822, there was a stone-coffin across the road of this dolmen, but it was demolished after a somewhat \\"scientific\\" excavation, led by Colonel H√∏egh Guldberg. 700 m to the east of The √Örslev Dolmen, there was another dolmen. It was removed for an unknown reason at some point in the 1880s. The history surrounding √Örslev Dyssen might be more impressive than its looks. The dolmen grounds are privately owned by the auto company next to it, but publicly accessible.

From early times, it has been a gesture of deep respect for a superior. Today, the gesture is common in the Christian religious practices of the Anglican Church, Lutheran Church, Roman Catholic Church, and Western Rite Orthodox Church. The Latin word , from which the English word is derived, originally meant kneeling with both knees rather than the rapid dropping to one knee and immediately rising that became customary in Western Europe in the Middle Ages. It is often referred to as \\"going down on one knee\\" or \\"bowing the knee\\". In Western culture, one genuflects on the left knee to a human dignitary, whether ecclesiastical or civil, while, in Christian churches and chapels, one genuflects on the right knee when the Sacrament is not exposed but in a tabernacle or veiled (conversely, one kneels with both knees if the Sacrament is exposed). History Traditionally marriage proposals use genuflection In 328 BC, Alexander the Great introduced into his court-etiquette some form of genuflection already in use in Persia, a modification to the tradition of Proskynesis.Andrew Chugg, Alexander's Lovers , p. 103 In the Byzantine Empire even senators were required to genuflect to the emperor.James Allan Stewart Evans, The Age of Justinian , p. 101 In medieval Europe, one demonstrated respect for a king or noble by going down on the left knee, often remaining there until told to rise. It is traditionally often performed in western cultures by a man making a proposal of marriage. This is done on the left knee. The custom of genuflecting, as a sign of respect and even of service, arose out of the honor given to medieval kings. In modern times, when the folded flag of a fallen veteran is offered to the family, the presenting officer will go down on his left knee, if the recipient is seated.  In Christianity  Genuflection, typically on one knee, still plays a part in the Anglican, Lutheran, Roman Catholic and Western Rite Orthodox traditions, among other churches; it is different from kneeling in prayer, which is more widespread. Those for whom the gesture is difficult, such as the aged or those in poor physical condition, are not expected to perform it. Except for those people, genuflection is still today mandatory in some situations, such as (in the Catholic Church) when passing in front of the Blessed Sacrament, or during the Consecration in the Mass. = In front of the Blessed Sacrament = Genuflection is a sign of reverence to the Blessed Sacrament. Its purpose is to allow the worshipper to engage his whole person in acknowledging the presence of and to honor Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist. It is customary to genuflect whenever one comes into or leaves the presence of the Blessed Sacrament reserved in the Tabernacle. \\"This venerable practice of genuflecting before the Blessed Sacrament, whether enclosed in the tabernacle or publicly exposed, as a sign of adoration, ...requires that it be performed in a recollected way. In order that the heart may bow before God in profound reverence, the genuflection must be neither hurried nor careless.\\"\\"Sacred Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship\\", Inaestimable donum, ¬ß26, 17 April 1980 A common-sense exception applies to a sacristan or custodian for whom it would be impractical to constantly be genuflecting in the course of their duties.Field, James. \\"Why Do Catholics Genuflect in Church or before the Tabernacle?\\", J. S. Paluch Co. Genuflection to the Blessed Sacrament, the consecrated Eucharist, especially when arriving or leaving its presence, is a practice in the Anglican Communion, the Latin Rite Catholic Church, the Lutheran Church, and the Western Rite Orthodox Church. It is a comparatively modern replacement for the profound bow of head and body that remains the supreme act of liturgical reverence in the East.Bergh, Frederick Thomas. \\"Genuflexion.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 7 October 2016 Since in many Anglican, Roman Catholic and Western Orthodox Churches the Blessed Sacrament is normally present behind the altar, genuflection is usual when arriving or passing in front of the altar at the communion rail. When genuflecting, making the sign of the cross is optional. Only during the later Middle Ages, centuries after it had become customary to genuflect to persons in authority such as bishops, was genuflection to the Blessed Sacrament introduced. The practice gradually spread and became viewed as obligatory only from the end of the fifteenth century, receiving formal recognition in 1502. The raising of the consecrated Host and Chalice after the Consecration in order to show them to the people was for long unaccompanied by obligatory genuflections. The requirement that genuflection take place on both knees before the Blessed Sacrament when it is unveiled as at Expositions (but not when it is lying on the corporal during Mass) was altered in 1973 with introduction of the following rule: \\"Genuflection in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, whether reserved in the tabernacle or exposed for public adoration, is on one knee.\\"De Sacra Communione et de Cultu Mysterii Eucharistici extra Missam, 84 \\"Since a genuflection is, per se, an act of adoration, the general liturgical norms no longer make any distinction between the mode of adoring Christ reserved in the tabernacle or exposed upon the altar. The simple single genuflection on one knee may be used in all cases.\\" However, in some countries the episcopal conference has chosen to retain the double genuflection to the Blessed Sacrament, which is performed by kneeling briefly on both knees and reverently bowing the head with hands joined. = Episcopalian practice = In the Episcopal Church, genuflection is an act of personal piety and is not required by the prayer book. In some parishes it is a customary gesture of reverence for Christ's real presence in the consecrated Eucharistic elements of bread and wine, particularly in parishes with an Anglo-Catholic tradition. Generally, if the Blessed Sacrament is reserved in the church, it is customary to acknowledge the Lord's presence with a brief act of worship on entering or leaving the building ‚Äì normally, a genuflection in the direction of the place of reservation. During the Liturgy Manuel II of Portugal during Missa de Campanha, c. 1910 The General Instruction of the Roman Missal lays down the following rules for genuflections during Mass: :Three genuflections are made by the priest celebrant: namely, after the showing of the host, after the showing of the chalice, and before Communion. Certain specific features to be observed in a concelebrated Mass are noted in their proper place. :If, however, the tabernacle with the Most Blessed Sacrament is present in the sanctuary, the priest, the deacon, and the other ministers genuflect when they approach the altar and when they depart from the sanctuary, but not during the celebration of Mass itself. :Otherwise all who pass before the Most Blessed Sacrament genuflect, unless they are moving in procession. :Ministers carrying the processional cross or candles bow their heads instead of genuflecting. = Other genuflections= In the Byzantine Rite, most widely observed in the Orthodox Church, genuflection plays a smaller role and prostration, known as proskynesis, is much more common. During the holy mystery of reconciliation, however, following confession of sins, the penitent is to genuflect with head bowed before the Gospel Book or an icon of Christ as the confessor - either a bishop or a presbyter - formally declares God's forgiveness. Genuflection or kneeling is prescribed at various points of the Roman Rite liturgy, such as after the mention of Jesus' death on the cross in the readings of the Passion during Holy Week. A right knee genuflection is made during and after the Adoration of the Cross on Good Friday. A genuflection is made at the mention of the Incarnation in the words et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto, ex Maria Virgine, et homo factus est (\\"and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man\\") in the Creed on the solemnities of Christmas and the Annunciation. It is common practice that during the recital of the Angelus prayer, for the lines \\"And the Word was made flesh/And dwelt among us\\", those reciting the prayer bow or genuflect.Looney, Edward. \\"Promoting the Angelus as an Advent Devotion\\", Catholic Lane, December 01, 2014 Tridentine Mass In the Tridentine Mass this genuflection is made on any day on which the Creed is recited at Mass, as well as at several other points: * at the words et Verbum caro factum est (\\"and the Word became flesh\\") in the prologue of the Gospel of John, which is the usual Last Gospel, as well as the Gospel for the third Mass on Christmas. * at the words et procidentes adoraverunt eum (\\"and falling down they adored him\\") in the Gospel for the Epiphany, Matthew 2:1-12 (which before 1960 was also the Last Gospel of the third Mass on Christmas) * at the words Adiuva nos ... during the (identical) Tract said on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in Lent, except on Ember Wednesday. But no genuflection is envisaged when after Septuagesima the same Tract is used in the votive Mass at a time of Mortality (Missa votiva tempore mortalitatis) * at the words et procidens adoravit eum (\\"and falling down he adored him\\") at the end of the Gospel for Wednesday in the Fourth Week of Lent, John 9:1-38 * at the words ut in nomine Iesu omne genu flectatur caelestium, terrestrium et infernorum (\\"that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth\\") in the Epistle () of Palm Sunday, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross on 14 September (and also, before 1960, the Feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross on 3 May) and in the Epistle () of the votive Mass of the Passion of the Lord. * at the words Veni, sancte Spiritus in the Alleluia before the Sequence on Pentecost Sunday and the Octave of Pentecost and in the votive Mass of the Holy Spirit In the Maronite Catholic Church, there is an evocative ceremony of genuflection on the feast of Pentecost. The congregation genuflects first on the left knee to God the Father, then on the right knee to God the Son, and finally on both knees to God the Holy Spirit. = Genuflecting to a bishop = From the custom of genuflecting to kings and other nobles arose the custom by which lay people or clergy of lesser rank genuflect to a prelate and kiss his episcopal ring,Canons of the Holy Orthodox Church, American Jurisdiction as a sign of acceptance of the bishop's apostolic authority as representing Christ in the local church, and originally their social position as lords. Abbots and other senior monastics often received genuflection from their monks and often others. Genuflecting before greater prelates (i.e. Bishops in their own dioceses, Metropolitans in their province, Papal Legates in the territory assigned to them, and Cardinals either outside of Rome or in the church assigned to them in Rome) is treated as obligatory in editions of the Caeremoniale Episcoporum earlier than that of 1985; during liturgical functions according to these prescriptions, clergy genuflect when passing before such prelates, but an officiating priest and any more junior prelates, canons, etc. substitute a bow of the head and shoulders for the genuflection. The present Catholic liturgical books exclude genuflecting to a bishop during the liturgy: \\"A genuflection, made by bending the right knee to the ground, signifies adoration, and therefore it is reserved for the Most Blessed Sacrament, as well as for the Holy Cross from the solemn adoration during the liturgical celebration on Good Friday until the beginning of the Easter Vigil.\\"The General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 274 But outside of the liturgy some continue to genuflect or kneel to kiss a bishop's ring.Baciamano Though it is frequently asserted that genuflections are to be made on the left knee when made to merely human authorities,\\"Genuflection ‚Äî which knee is which?\\", The Compass, March 19, 2011, Catholic Diocese of Green Bay, Wisconsin there is no such prescription in any liturgical book.

It lies about north-northeast of N√Æmes, west of Avignon, and south- east of Al√®s. Old town History Originally Ucetia or Eutica in Latin, Uz√®s was a small Gallo-Roman oppidum, or administrative settlement. The town lies at the source of the Alzon river, at Fontaine d'Eure, from where a Roman aqueduct was built in the first century BC, to supply water to the local city of N√Æmes, away. The most famous stretch of the aqueduct is the Pont du Gard, now a World Heritage site, which carried fresh water over splendid arches across the river Gardon. The civilized and tolerant urban life of 5th-century Uz√®s contrasted with the Frankish north. Jews were apparently settled there as early as the 5th century. Saint Ferr√©ol, Bishop of Uz√®s, allegedly admitted them to his table; on this account complaint was made of him to King Childebert I, whereupon the bishop was obliged to change his attitude toward the Jews, compelling all those who would not become Christians to leave Uz√®s. After his death (581) many who had received baptism returned to Judaism.Gallia Christiana, vi. 613; Dom Vaiss√®te, Histoire G√©n√©rale de Languedoc, i. 274, 545 Jews were expelled from the region in 614. In early 8th century, Uz√®s was a fortified civitas and bishopric under the Archbishop of Narbonne. During the Umayyad conquest of Gothic Septimania, Uz√®s became the northernmost stronghold of Muslim Spain circa 725. Charles Martel went on to lay siege to the stronghold in 736, but it remained in Gothic-Andalusian hands up to 752, when counts loyal to Ansemund of N√Æmes handed over a large number of strongholds to the Frankish Pepin the Short. In 753 the stronghold rebelled against the Franks after Ansemund's assassination, but the uprising was suppressed and a Frankish trustee of Pepin imposed. In the 13th century, Uz√®s hosted a small community of Jewish scholars, as well as a community of Cathars. Farmers market Like many cloth-manufacturing centers (Uz√®s was known for its serges), the city and the surrounding countryside were strongly Protestant during the Wars of Religion in the 16th century, which wreaked havoc in Languedoc. Numerous of the city's churches were trashed and burned by furious Protestants: only two remain today. One such destroyed and rebuilt church is Saint-√âtienne. Dukes of Uz√®s The title of Duke of Uz√®s, in the family de Crussol d'Uz√®s, is the premier title in the peerage of France, coming right after the princes of the blood. The title of seigneur d'Uz√®s is attested in a charter of 1088. After part of Languedoc was attached to royal demesne (1229), the lords' (and later dukes') military skill and fealty to the Crown propelled their rise through the nobility, until, after the treason of the last Duke of Montmorency, beheaded in 1632, the title of First Duke of France fell to Uz√®s, who retain their stronghold in the center of town today, which has expanded round the 11th century Tour Bermond. If France were a kingdom, it would be the job of the duke of Uz√®s to cry out, \\"Le Roi est mort. Vive le Roi!\\" at each state funeral, and defend the honour of the queen mother. Twenty-one dukes have been wounded or killed as hereditary Champion of France over the centuries. Sights Duch√© Palace The present-day city retains the trace of its walls as a circuit of boulevards. A Capuchin chapel, built in 1635 to house the mortal remains of the dukes, occupies the site of a 1st-century AD temple dedicated to the first Roman Emperor, Augustus. There are monuments of the prestige of the former bishopric, once one of the most extensive of Languedoc, but extinguished at the Revolution, and private houses that witness the wealth that the textile trade brought in the 16th century. The town is also homes to three feudal towers, the Bermonde Tower (part of the ch√¢teau du Duch√©), the Bishop Tower and the Royal Tower. Uz√®s Cathedral was destroyed in the Albigensian Crusade, rebuilt, and destroyed again in the 16th century Wars of Religion. Rebuilt again in the 17th century, it was stripped out during the French Revolution. The 11th century Romanesque Tour Fenestrelle (\\"Window Tower\\"), with its paired windows, is probably the most famous icon of the city. It was listed as a French Historical Monument in 1862. Uz√®s is famous in the area for its Saturday market. Not only does the market offer local produce, but it also boasts textiles made in the region and many tourist delights.\\\\- Delights of Uzes Market  Economy  Tourism is one of the key industrial sectors, alongside the local arts scene and wine making. The region has a long history in the production of licorice. The German company Haribo maintains a factory and museum in Uz√®s, which traces its roots back to the licorice factory Henri Lefont opened there in 1862. His company later merged with Ricql√®s, and was then taken over by Haribo.

The recall is an effort to limit ruination of the corporate image and limit liability for corporate negligence, which can cause significant legal costs. It can be difficult, if not impossible, to determine how costly can be releasing to the consumer a product that could endanger someone's life and the economic loss resulting from unwanted publicity. Recalls are costly. Costs include having to handle the recalled product, replacing it and possibly being held financially responsible for the consequences of the recalled product. A country's consumer protection laws will have specific requirements in regard to product recalls. Such regulations may include how much of the cost the maker will have to bear, situations in which a recall is compulsory (usually because the risk is big enough), or penalties for failure to recall. The firm may also initiate a recall voluntarily, perhaps subject to the same regulations as if the recall were compulsory. General steps to a product recall A product recall usually involves the following steps, which may differ according to local laws: * Maker or dealer notifies the authorities responsible of their intention to recall a product. In some cases the government can also request a recall of a product. Consumer hotlines or other communication channels are established. The scope of the recall, that is, which serial numbers or batch numbers etc. are recalled, is often specified. * Product recall announcements are released on the respective government agency's website (if applicable), as well as in paid notices in the metropolitan daily newspapers. In some circumstances, heightened publicity will also result in news television reports advising of the recall. * When a consumer group learns of a recall it will also notify the public by various means. * Typically, the consumer is advised to return the goods, regardless of condition, to the seller for a full refund or modification. * Avenues for possible consumer compensation will vary depending on the specific laws governing consumer trade protection and the cause of recall.

Recalls by industry =Automotive industry= In general, the number of recalls has been increasing ‚Äì with an exception during the economic crisis of 2009‚Äì2010 ‚Äì due to time, cost and market pressure. Per year, global automotive warranties are estimated as USD 40 billion, 3‚Äì5% loss in sales. Low-priced production often leads to minor quality, and outsourcing leads to a shift of knowledge concerning techniques and processes. This way, technical failures are more likely to occur due to communication problems between the different parties engaged in the supply chain and missing definitions for technical interfaces. Despite the increasing number of recalls, a Mojo Motors, Inc. study found only .005 percent of customers ask about recalls when contacting dealerships. Since 1966, 390 million motor vehicles have been recalled in the USA. 29 million cars were recalled in 2018. That number is down from its peak of 50 million in 2016, but on average, recalls are on the rise. More cars have been recalled in the past five years than between 2003 and 2014. Manufacturers have to notify the owner when there is a recall notice, but in the case of a second, third or fourth owner of the car, the company may be sending the notice to a previous one. =Food industry= Emptied grocery shelves during the 2018 American salmonella outbreak. Such clearances were done to prevent the sale of potentially contaminated agricultural products Over 3000 food products were recalled in the US in 2016 according to the US Food and Drug Administration Enforcement reports. Individual recall events caused by contamination from foreign bodies (physical contamination from metal, glass, plastic, wood etc.) has increased by 76% in 2016 compared with 2015. This increase in 2016 is even more marked when looking at the number of products recalled (as opposed to recall event) due to foreign body contamination. In 2016 there were 422 products recalled due to foreign body contamination, whilst in 2015 there were 108; almost a 300% increase. Pet food recalls Every year, there are several pet food and treat recalls due to spoiled or tainted ingredients. Perhaps the most known was in 2007. The 2007 pet food recalls involved the massive recall of many brands of cat and dog foods beginning in March 2007. The recalls came in response to reports of renal failure in pets consuming mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company, beginning in February 2007. The recall began voluntarily with the Canadian company Menu Foods on March 16, 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the test animals. Overall, several major companies have recalled 150 different brands of food comprising more than 5,000 separate pet food products. The FDA and USDA investigation found the food to be intentionally contaminated with the chemical melamine. However pet food recalls are not rare at all. The 2007 recall stands out and is well known because of the sheer size, scope, and number of animals affected. But pet food recalls occur on a regular basis. For instance, on September 12, 2008 Mars Petcare US announced a voluntary recall of all dry pet food products produced at its plant in Everson, Pennsylvania, citing potential contamination with salmonella. =Snack food recall= On July 23, 2018, Pepperidge Farm announced that the Flavor Blasted Xtra Cheddar Goldfish crackers were being recalled due to possible salmonella contamination in the whey powder used on them. This recall also affected the Flavor Blasted Sour Cream and Onion, Whole Grain Xtra Cheddar, and Xtra Cheddar and Pretzel varieties. Also more snack products were recalled for various safety reasons. Mondelƒìz Global LLC recalled all Ritz Crackers products that are containing whey after traces of salmonella were detected on the whey powder. The recall includes Ritz cheese cracker sandwiches and mixed cookie and cracker variety packs. Flower Foods recalled all of their Swiss Rolls products sold under the H-E-B, Food Lion, Mrs. Freshley's, Baker's Treat, Market Square, and Great Value brands due to contamination of salmonella. John Derst's Old Fashioned Bread was also affected by the recall. Pinnacle Foods, Inc. issued a recall on all Hungry Man BBQ boneless chicken wing products due to salmonella being detected in the whey powder of the ranch dressing.

His second book, The Fifth Gospel, was published in 2015. Personal life Caldwell was born and raised in Fairfax County, Virginia during which time he met his future writing collaborator, Dustin Thomason. Both graduated from the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in 1994. Caldwell graduated Phi Beta Kappa with an A.B. in history from Princeton University in 1998 after completing an 127-page-long senior thesis, titled \\"The French Popular Front and the Debate over Intervention in the Spanish Civil War\\", under the supervision of Thomas J. Dandelet. After college, while working with Thomason on their first novel, Caldwell worked at MicroStrategy in Tyson Corner and taught test preparation for Kaplan in Blacksburg while his wife, Meredith, earned her DVM at Virginia Tech. The couple lived in Newport News before moving to Vienna to raise their three children: Ethan, Jude, and Luke. Writing career Upon graduating from their respective colleges, Caldwell began working with Thomason on the novel The Rule of Four. After writing together for a summer, the two continued to collaborate online and by telephone for the next five years. The plot centers on four Princeton seniors attempting to solve a mystery related to the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, an Italian work from the early Renaissance. The book was published by Dial Press in 2004, spent 49 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list and has sold almost 2 million copies. It was often compared to Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code due to its similar style of teaching history through a fictional plot as well as the proximity in date of publication. It took Caldwell ten years to complete his second work, The Fifth Gospel, which was published by Simon & Schuster in 2015. This solo work tells the fictional story of two brothers, both priests, exploring the Diatessaron, the \\"fifth\\" gospel, and how it might lead to reconciliation between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.

The genus lived during the Silurian period, from around 432 to 418 million years ago. Eurypterus is by far the most well- studied and well-known eurypterid and its fossil specimens probably represent more than 90% of all known eurypterid specimens. There are fifteen species belonging to the genus Eurypterus, the most common of which is Eurypterus remipes, the first eurypterid fossil discovered and the state fossil of New York. Members of Eurypterus averaged at about in length, but the largest individual discovered was estimated to be long. They all possessed spine- bearing appendages and a large paddle they used for swimming. They were generalist species, equally likely to engage in predation or scavenging. Discovery The first fossil of Eurypterus was found in 1818 by S. L. Mitchill, a fossil collector. It was recovered from the Bertie Formation of New York (near Westmoreland, Oneida County). Mitchill interpreted the appendages on the carapace as barbels arising from the mouth. He consequently identified the fossil as a catfish of the genus Silurus. It was only after seven years, in 1825, that the American zoologist James Ellsworth De Kay identified the fossil correctly as an arthropod. He named it Eurypterus remipes and established the genus Eurypterus in the process. The name means \\"wide wing\\" or \\"broad paddle\\", referring to the swimming legs, from Greek Œµ·ΩêœÅœçœÇ (eur√∫s, wide) and œÄœÑŒµœÅœåŒΩ (pteron, wing). However, De Kay thought Eurypterus was a branchiopod (a group of crustaceans which include fairy shrimps and water fleas). Soon after, Eurypterus lacustris was also discovered in New York in 1835 by the paleontologist Richard Harlan. Another species was discovered in Estonia in 1858 by Jan Nieszkowski. He considered it to be of the same species as the first discovery (E. remipes); it is now known as Eurypterus tetragonophthalmus. These specimens from Estonia are often of extraordinary quality, retaining the actual cuticle of their exoskeletons. In 1898, the Swedish paleontologist Gerhard Holm separated these fossils from the bedrock with acids. Holm was then able to examine the almost perfectly preserved fragments under a microscope. His remarkable study led to the modern breakthrough on eurypterid morphology. More fossils were recovered in great abundance in New York in the 19th century, and elsewhere in eastern Eurasia and North America. Today, Eurypterus remains one of the most commonly found and best known eurypterid genera, comprising more than 95% of all known eurypterid fossils. Classification The genus Eurypterus belongs to the family Eurypteridae. They are classified under the superfamily Eurypteroidea, suborder Eurypterina, order Eurypterida, and the subphylum Chelicerata. Until recently, eurypterids were thought to belong to the class Merostomata along with order Xiphosura. It is now believed that eurypterids are a sister group to Arachnida, closer to scorpions and spiders than to horseshoe crabs. Eurypterus was the first recognized taxon of eurypterids and is the most common. As a consequence, nearly every remotely similar eurypterid in the 19th century was classified under the genus (except for the distinctive members of the family Pterygotidae and Stylonuridae). The genus was eventually split into several genera as the science of taxonomy developed. In 1958, several species distinguishable by closer placed eyes and spines on their swimming legs were split off into the separate genus Erieopterus by Erik Kjellesvig-Waering. Another split was proposed by Lief St√∏rmer in 1973 when he reclassified some Eurypterus to Baltoeurypterus based on the size of some of the last segments of their swimming legs. O. Erik Tetlie in 2006 deemed these differences too insignificant to justify a separate genus. He merged Baltoeurypterus back into Eurypterus. It is now believed that the minor variations described by St√∏rmer are simply the differences found in adults and juveniles within a species. Description 350px The largest arthropods to have ever existed were eurypterids. The largest known species (Jaekelopterus rhenaniae) reached up to in length, about the size of a crocodile. Species of Eurypterus, however, were much smaller. E. remipes are usually between in length. E. lacustris average at larger sizes at in length. The largest specimen of E. remipes ever found was long, currently on display at the Paleontological Research Institution of New York. Eurypterus fossils often occur in similar sizes in a given area. This may be a result of the fossils being 'sorted' into windrows as they were being deposited in shallow waters by storms and wave action. Comparison of an average adult human male () with the average Eurypterus remipes length (around ) and the largest known Eurypterus remipes fossil (). The Eurypterus body is broadly divided into two parts: the prosoma and the opisthosoma (in turn divided into the mesosoma and the metasoma). The prosoma is the forward part of the body, it is actually composed of six segments fused together to form the head and the thorax. It contains the semicircular to subrectangular platelike carapace. On the dorsal side of the latter are two large crescent- shaped compound eyes. They also possessed two smaller light-sensitive simple eyes (the median ocelli) near the center of the carapace on a small elevation (known as the ocellar mound). Underneath the carapace is the mouth and six appendages, usually referred to in Roman numerals I-VI. Each appendage in turn is composed of nine segments (known as podomeres) labeled in Arabic numerals 1‚Äì9. The first segments which connect the appendages to the body are known as the coxa (plural coxae). The first pair (Appendage I) are the chelicerae, small pincer-like arms used for tearing food apart (mastication) during feeding. After the chelicerae are three pairs of short legs (Appendages II, III, and IV). They are spiniferous, with predominantly two spines on each podomere and with the tipmost segment having a single spine. The last two segments are often indistinguishable and give the appearance of a single segment having three spines. They are used both for walking and for food capture. The next pair (Appendage V) is the most leg-like of all appendages, longer than the first three pairs and are mostly spineless except at the tipmost segments. The last pair (Appendage VI) are two broad paddle-like legs used for swimming. The coxae of Appendage VI are broad and flat, resembling an 'ear'. The ophisthosoma (the abdomen) is composed of 12 segments, each consisting of a fused upper plate (tergite) and bottom plate (sternite). It is further subdivided in two ways. Based on the width and structure of each segment, they can be divided into the broad preabdomen (segments 1 to 7) and the narrow postabdomen (segments 8 to 12). The preabdomen is the broader segments of the anterior portion of the ophisthosoma while the postabdomen are the last five segments of the Eurypterus body. Each of the segments of the postabdomen contain lateral flattened protrusions known as the epimera with the exception of the last needle-like (styliform) segment known as the telson (the 'tail'). The segment immediately preceding the telson (which also has the largest epimera of the postabdomen) is known as the pretelson. An alternative way to divide the ophisthosoma is by function. It can also be divided into the mesosoma (segments 1 to 6), and the metasoma (segments 7 to 12). The mesosoma contains the gills and reproductive organs of Eurypterus. Its ventral segments are overlaid by appendage-derived plates known as Blatf√ºsse (singular Blatfuss, German for \\"sheet foot\\"). Protected within which are the branchial chambers which contain the respiratory organs of Eurypterus. The metasoma, meanwhile, do not possess Blatf√ºsse. Some authors incorrectly use mesosoma and preabdomen interchangeably, as with metasoma and postabdomen. The main respiratory organs of Eurypterus were what seems to be book gills, located in branchial chambers within the segments of the mesosoma. They may have been used for underwater respiration. They are composed of several layers of thin tissue stacked in such a way as to resemble the pages of a book, hence the name. In addition, they also possessed five pairs of oval-shaped areas covered with microscopic projections on the ceiling of the second branchial chambers within the mesosoma, immediately below the gill tracts. These areas are known as Kiemenplatten (or gill-tracts, though the former term is preferred). They are unique to eurypterids. Eurypterus are sexually dimorphic. On the bottom side of the first two segments of the mesosoma are central appendages used for reproduction. In females, they are long and narrow. In the males they are very short. A minority of authors, however, assume the reverse: longer genital appendage for males, shorter for females. The exoskeleton of Eurypterus is often covered with small outgrowths known as ornamentation. They include pustules (small protrusions), scales, and striations. They vary by species and are used for identification. For more detailed diagnostic descriptions of each species under Eurypterus, see sections below. Distribution and geologic time range Members of Eurypterus existed for a relatively short time, yet they are the most abundant eurypterids found today. They flourished between the Late Llandovery epoch (around 432 million years ago) to sometime during the P≈ô√≠dol√≠ epoch (418.1 million years ago) of the Silurian period. A span of only around 10 to 14 million years. During this period, the landmasses were mostly restricted to the southern hemisphere of the Earth, with the supercontinent Gondwana straddling the South Pole. The equator had three continents (Avalonia, Baltica, and Laurentia) which slowly drifted together to form the second supercontinent of Laurussia (also known as Euramerica, not to be confused with Laurasia). The ancestors of Eurypterus were believed to have originated from Baltica (eastern Laurussia, modern western Eurasia) based on the earliest recorded fossils. During the Silurian, they spread to Laurentia (western Laurussia, modern North America) when the two continents began to collide. They rapidly colonized the continent as invasive species, becoming the most dominant eurypterid in the region. This accounts for why they are the most commonly found genus of eurypterids today. Eurypterus (and other members of Eurypteroidea), however, were unable to cross vast expanses of oceans between the two supercontinents during the Silurian. Their range were thus limited to the coastlines and the large, shallow, and hypersaline inland seas of Laurussia. They are now only known from fossils from North America, Europe, and northwestern Asia, cratons that were the former components of Laurussia. While three species of Eurypterus were purportedly discovered in China in 1957, the evidence of them belonging to the genus (or if they were even eurypterids at all) is nonexistent. No other traces of Eurypterus in modern continents from Gondwana are currently known. Eurypterus are very common fossils in their regions of occurrence, millions of specimens are possible in a given area, though access to the rock formations may be difficult. Most fossil eurypterids are the disjointed shed exoskeleton (known as exuviae) of individuals after molting (ecdysis). Some are complete but are most probably exuviae as well. Fossils of the actual remains of eurypterids (i.e. their carcasses) are relatively rare. Fossil eurypterids are often deposited in characteristic windrows, probably a result of wave and wind action. Paleobiology and paleoecology Rowing in Eurypterus. Eurypterus belongs to the suborder Eurypterina, eurypterids in which the sixth appendage had developed a broad swimming paddle remarkably similar to that of the modern-day swimming crab. Modeling studies on Eurypterus swimming behavior suggest that they utilized a drag-based rowing type of locomotion where appendages moved synchronously in near-horizontal planes. The paddle blades are almost vertically oriented on the backward and down stroke, pushing the animal forward and lifting it up. The blades are then oriented horizontally on the recovery stroke to slash through the water without pushing the animal back. This type of swimming is exhibited by crabs and water beetles. Subaqueous flight in Eurypterus. An alternative hypothesis for Eurypterus swimming behavior is that individuals were capable of underwater flying (or subaqueous flight), in which the sinuous motions and shape of the paddles themselves acting as hydrofoils are enough to generate lift. This type is similar to that found in sea turtles and sea lions. It has a relatively slower acceleration rate than the rowing type, especially since adults have proportionally smaller paddles than juveniles. But since the larger sizes of adults mean a higher drag coefficient, using this type of propulsion is more energy-efficient. Juveniles probably swam using the rowing type, the rapid acceleration afforded by this propulsion is more suited for quickly escaping predators. A small Eurypterus could achieve two and a half body lengths per second immediately. Larger adults, meanwhile, probably swam with the subaqueous flight type. The maximum velocity of adults when cruising would have been per second, slightly faster than turtles and sea otters. Trace fossil evidence indicates that Eurypterus employed a rowing stroke when in close proximity to the seafloor. Arcuites bertiensis is an ichnospecies that includes a pair of crescent-shaped impressions and a short medial drag, and it has been found in upper Silurian eurypterid Lagerstatten in Ontario and Pennsylvania. This trace fossil is very similar to traces made by modern aquatic swimming insects that row such as water boatmen, and is considered to have been made by juvenile to adult-sized eurypterids while swimming in very shallow nearshore marine environments. The morphology of A. bertiensis suggests that Eurypterus had the ability to move its swimming appendages in both the horizontal and vertical plane. Eurypterus did not swim to hunt, rather they simply swam in order to move from one feeding site to another quickly. Most of the time they walked on the substrate with their legs (including their swimming leg). They were generalist species, equally likely to engage in predation or scavenging. They hunted small soft- bodied invertebrates like worms. They utilized the mass of spines on their front appendages to both kill and hold them while they used their chelicerae to rip off pieces small enough to swallow. Young individuals may also have fallen prey to cannibalism by larger adults. Eurypterus were most probably marine animals, as their remains are mostly found in intertidal shallow environments. The concentrations of Eurypterus fossils in certain sites has been interpreted to be a result of mass mating and molting behavior. Juveniles were likely to have inhabited nearshore hypersaline environments, safer from predators, and moved to deeper waters as they grew older and larger. Adults that reach sexual maturity would then migrate en masse to shore areas in order to mate, lay eggs, and molt. Activities that would have made them more vulnerable to predators. This could also explain why the vast majority of fossils found in such sites are molts and not of actual animals. The same behavior can be seen in modern horseshoe crabs. =Respiration= Examinations of the respiratory systems of Eurypterus have led many paleontologists to conclude that it was capable of breathing air and walking on land for a short amount of time. Eurypterus had two types of respiratory systems. Its main organs for breathing were the book gills inside the segments of the mesosoma. These structures were supported by semicircular 'ribs' and were probably attached near the center of the body, similar to the gills of modern horseshoe crabs. They were protected under platelike appendages (which actually formed the apparent 'belly' of Eurypterus) known as Blatf√ºsse. These gills may have also played a role in osmoregulation. The second system are the Kiemenplatten, also referred to as gill-tracts. These oval-shaped areas within the body wall of the preabdomen. Their surfaces are covered with numerous small spines arranged into hexagonal 'rosettes'. These areas were vascularized, hence the conclusion that they were secondary breathing organs. The function of the book gills are usually interpreted to be for aquatic breathing, while the Kiemenplatten are supplementary for temporary breathing on land. However, some authors have argued that the two systems alone could not have supported an organism the size of Eurypterus. Both structures might actually have been for breathing air and the true gills (for underwater breathing) of Eurypterus have yet to be discovered. Eurypterus, however, were undoubtedly primarily aquatic. =Ontogeny= Juvenile Eurypterus differed from adults in several ways. Their carapaces were narrower and longer (parabolic) in contrast to the trapezoidal carapaces of adults. The eyes are aligned almost laterally but move to a more anterior location during growth. The preabdomen also lengthened, increasing the overall length of the ophisthosoma. The swimming legs also became narrower and the telsons shorter and broader (though in E. tetragonophthalmus and E. henningsmoeni the telsons changed from being angular in juveniles to larger and more rounded in adults). All these changes are believed to be a result of the respiratory and reproductive requirements of adults.

Found in the Rootsik√ºla Formation of Saaremaa (√ñsel), Estonia with additional discoveries in Ukraine, Norway, and possibly Moldova and Romania. The list does not include the large number of fossils previously classified under Eurypterus. Most of them are now reclassified to other genera, identified as other animals (like crustaceans) or pseudofossils, or remains of doubtful placement. Classification is based on Dunlop et al.(2011). Phylogeny The genus Eurypterus derives from E. minor, the oldest known species from the Llandovery of Scotland. E. minor is believed to have diverged from Dolichopterus macrocheirus sometime in the Llandovery. The following is the phylogenetic tree of Eurypterus based on phylogenetic studies by O. Erik Tetlie in 2006. Some species are not represented. In popular culture E. remipes was designated the New York State Fossil by the then Governor Mario Cuomo in 1984.

Geography Landeck is located in the Tyrolean Oberland in the west of the state at an elevation of about . The town is situated in the valley of the Inn River at the confluence with the Sanna tributary, between the Lechtal Alps, part of the Northern Limestone Alps in the north, and the √ñtztal Alps and Samnaun Alps ranges of the Central Eastern Alps in the south. The Inn valley is an important transport route from Tyrol to the west across the Arlberg massif. In the south, the Reschen Pass at the main chain of the Alps leads to the Vinschgau region in Italian South Tyrol. =Climate= History Landeck Castle In ancient times, the Via Claudia Augusta ran across the Reschen Pass and through the Inn Valley Landeck, connecting the Roman Italia peninsula with the Raetia province conquered in 15 BC. Throughout the Middle Ages the valley remained an important junction of trade routes leading to Augsburg via the Fern Pass and westwards across the Arlberg. From the late 13th century onwards the Meinhardiner counts of Tyrol controlled the area from their stronghold at Landeck Castle. Until 1867 Landeck (then spelled Landek) formed part of the Habsburg monarchy (Austrian Empire from 1804), except for a short period during the Napoleonic wars (1806-1814) when it was ceded to the Kingdom of Bavaria along with the rest of Tyrol. From 1867 (following the compromise of 1867) it formed part of the Cisleithanian (Austrian) part of Austria-Hungary; the spelling was also changed to Landeck in that year. After 1893 the name was officially changed again to Landeck in Tirol. Throughout these periods it was the capital of the district of the same name, one of the 21 ' in the Tyrol province.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 From 1782 a first pass road was built across the Arlberg at the behest of Emperor Joseph II; it was significantly enlarged until 1824. Landeck received access to the Arlberg railway in 1883. In 1904 it was elevated to the status of a market town, and finally was granted town privileges in 1923. Landeck was also used as a military base for Austrian mountain troops before the second world war, later, they became a unit of the German Wehrmacht. During the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany, Landeck was merged with neighboring Zams in 1939; however, both municipalities again split after World War II. Landeck was also the site of a UNRRA displaced person camp in the French sector of Allied-occupied Austria. Population Personalities * Raoul Schrott (born 1964), author  Transport  left Landeck-Zams station is an important hub for regional coach lines as well as a noteworthy stop for international trains on the Arlberg railway from the Tyrolean capital Innsbruck via the Arlberg Railway Tunnel to Bludenz in Vorarlberg.

Another seven‚Äîfive dreadnoughts and two fast battleships‚Äîwere cancelled in various stages of construction (one of which was converted into an aircraft carrier while being built) and seven more were cancelled before work began. The first battleship construction program followed a period of confusion in strategic thinking in France over the optimal shape of the fleet. At the time, the French naval command consisted of competing factions, with one that favored building fleets of capital ships, continuing the program of traditional ironclad warships that had dominated the fleet in the 1860s and 1870s. The other major faction preferred the Jeune √âcole doctrine, which emphasized the use of cheap torpedo boats to destroy expensive capital ships. During the period, naval construction decisions often depended on the Minister of the Navy in office at the time. A pair of ironclad battleships were cancelled by Admiral Th√©ophile Aube, an adherent of the Jeune √âcole, but one of the two was redesigned as the pre-dreadnought following Aube's departure. By the end of the decade, the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 that considerably strengthened the Royal Navy provided the justification the battleship faction needed to embark on a similar naval expansion program. The French replied with the Statut Naval (Naval Law) of 1890 that projected a total force of twenty-eight battleships. The initial program ordered four ships, with a fifth added during the design process: , , , , and . These were experimental ships, built to different designs but all to the same broad specifications; they were all characterized by pronounced tumblehome and a lozenge arrangement of a mixed-caliber main battery. All five proved to be disappointments, owing to poor stability and resistance to underwater attacks. The navy then began a series of standardized ships designed by a single architect; these were the three and the derivatives and . The initial series of French battleships saw relatively little activity, being primarily occupied with training activities through the 1890s and 1900s. They alternated between the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons before being withdrawn from front- line service at the end of the first decade of the 20th century as more modern battleships entered service. In 1900, the French government passed a new Statut Naval to counter growing German naval strength, which resulted in the two - and four s; they were very similar but differed in their secondary battery. These vessels proved to be much more successful than the earlier battleships of the French fleet, and they formed the backbone of the Mediterranean Squadron when war came in 1914. A new Statut Naval in 1906 brought about the construction of the six s and the seven dreadnoughts of the and es. The Dantons were pre-dreadnought vessels built after the launch of the British \\"all-big-gun\\" rendered such vessels obsolescent, though the French at that time preferred the higher rate of fire of the lighter secondary guns. Convinced of the need to follow suit with dreadnoughts of their own, the French ordered the four Courbets in 1910 and the three Bretagnes followed in 1912. These would be the last battleships completed for two decades, as World War I forced the French to cancel the and es (ordered for the 1913 and 1915 programs) as industrial and financial resources were diverted to the French Army and financial limitations after the war prevented further construction. During the war, the bulk of the French fleet was occupied with guarding the southern end of the Adriatic Sea to contain the Austro-Hungarian Navy, while older vessels were used elsewhere, particularly during the Dardanelles campaign, where Bouvet was sunk in 1915. After the war, the surviving pre- dreadnoughts were either scrapped or reduced to secondary roles. By the mid-1930s, the French again embarked on a naval construction program to counter the German and Italian fleets, resulting in the two s and four s; of the four Richelieus, two were cancelled by the start of World War II, and only one was completed in time to see action during the war. A final design, the , was authorized in 1940 after the war began but France's defeat in the Battle of France ended the program. The two Dunkerques saw limited action during the war, with being sunk during the British attack on Mers-el-K√©bir to prevent her from being seized by the Germans. and were also sunk there, and the third member of the class, , was seized by the British and turned over to the Free French Naval Forces. Refloated and returned to Toulon, Dunkerque and Provence were later scuttled there with her sister ship when the French intentionally scuttled the fleet to prevent German soldiers from capturing the vessels. Richelieu meanwhile was completed in the United States and served with the Free French from 1943. , with only one main battery gun turret operational, briefly engaged United States forces during Operation Torch in November 1942, and was eventually completed in the late 1940s. Both she and Richelieu served as training ships before eventually being decommissioned in 1968. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armament  The number and type of the primary armament - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armor  The maximum thickness of the armored belt - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Displacement  Ship displacement at full combat load - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Propulsion  Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Service  The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Laid down  The date the keel assembly commenced - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Commissioned  The date the ship was commissioned } __TOC__ Pre-dreadnought battleships =Brennus= Brennus underway early in her career Brennus, built in the late 19th century, was the first pre-dreadnought battleship of the French Navy. During this period, the French Navy experimented with the Jeune √âcole, which emphasized cheap torpedo boats and cruisers instead of the expensive ironclad warships that had dominated naval construction in the 1860s and 1870s, and so the navy ordered a series of experimental designs to determine the most effective ship types. Admiral Th√©ophile Aube, then the Minister of the Navy and a proponent of the Jeune √âcole, cancelled a pair of ironclad battleships in 1886, but after Aube left office his successor allowed one of the vessels to be redesigned as a modern pre-dreadnought battleship. Brennus was the only vessel built to her design, which had been prepared by Charles Ernest Huin, though it provided the basis for several subsequent ships. She departed from earlier French ironclad battleship designs by introducing a number of innovations. These included a main battery of heavy guns mounted on the centerline, homogeneous steel armor, and the first use of Belleville boilers. Brennus spent the majority of her career in the Mediterranean Squadron, initially serving as its flagship. In 1900, she accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer Fram√©e. As newer battleships were commissioned into the fleet, Brennus was relegated to the Reserve Squadron in the early 1900s; she spent this period largely inactive with a reduced crew, being reactivated for training exercises with the rest of the fleet. She was used as a training ship from 1908 to 1914. By the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, her old age and poor condition prevented her from seeing action and she was instead reduced to a hulk. She was ultimately stricken from the naval register in 1919 and sold for scrap three years later. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Brennus class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  In service ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   3 √ó Canon de Mod√®le 1887 guns    2 shafts, triple-expansion engines,  2 January 1889  11 January 1896  Broken up, 1922 } =Charles Martel= Illustration of Charles Martel underway Charles Martel was the first of a group of five broadly similar battleships ordered during the 1890 construction program as part of the French response to a major British naval construction program. The five ships were built to the same basic design parameters, though the individual architects were allowed to deviate from each other in lesser details. The ships were ordered in response to the British Naval Defence Act of 1889, which had authorized the construction of the eight s; the French law aimed to keep the fleet in a position of relative parity with the Royal Navy. A total of twenty-eight battleships were to be built throughout the program. To keep costs down and minimize objections from the Chamber of Deputies, the displacement of the new ships would be limited to . The basic design for the first ship, Charles Martel, was also prepared by Huin, who based it on Brennus, though the armament was arranged in the lozenge layout that had been used on a number of older ironclad battleships like the . The ship proved to be a disappointment in service, as did her four half-sisters, all of which suffered from poor stability, largely a result of their pronounced tumblehome and overloaded construction. The ship spent her career with the Mediterranean Squadron. In 1897, she joined the International Squadron sent to intervene in the 1897‚Äì1898 Greek uprising on Crete against rule by the Ottoman Empire. Charles Martel served as the flagship of the 2nd Division of the Mediterranean Squadron beginning in 1900 before being transferred to the Reserve Squadron in 1902. There, she served as the flagship until she was replaced in 1903. Charles Martel was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron in 1910 and was then moved to the newly-created 3rd Battle Squadron the next year. She returned to reserve status in 1912 and saw no further activity, ultimately being scrapped in 1922. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Charles Martel class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó Canon de Mod√®le 1887 guns 2 √ó Canon de Mod√®le 1887 guns  460 mm   2 shafts, triple-expansion engines,  1 August 1891  June 1897  Broken up, 1922 } =Carnot= Illustration of Carnot still under construction after her launching, c. 1896 Carnot was ordered under the same program that produced Charles Martel, and like the other vessel, she was largely based on Brennus and Magenta. But rather than simply repeat the same design, the French Naval Staff decided to allow different naval architects to build several different designs to evaluate the competing proposals for future programs. Carnot was designed by Victor Saglio, the Under-director of Naval Construction in Toulon. Compared to Charles Martel, Carnot was broadly similar, with the same main battery, though she had a smaller superstructure in an attempt to minimize topweight and thus instability that plagued many French capital ships during this period. The ship was nevertheless still too top-heavy and proved to suffer from insufficient stability. Modifications were made to the ship after she was completed, but they did not solve the problem, and like the rest of the ships of the 1890 program, Carnot was not a particularly successful vessel. The ship's early career followed a similar trajectory to Charles Martels; she spent much of it in the Mediterranean Squadron, and she too served with the International Squadron in 1897. She thereafter began alternating stints in the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons; she was with the Northern Squadron in 1901, followed by a brief return to the Mediterranean as part of the Reserve Squadron in 1903. The year 1904 saw her back with the Northern Squadron, where she remained until 1907, when she was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron in the Mediterranean. In early 1911, the unit was moved to Brest, France, before returning to Toulon later that year, where it was renumbered as the 3rd Squadron. Carnot was reduced to reserve in 1913 and was ultimately broken up in 1922. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Carnot class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1887 guns 2 √ó Canon de 274 mm Mod√®le 1887 guns  460 mm   2 shafts, triple-expansion engines,  July 1891  July 1897  Broken up, 1922 } =Jaur√©guiberry= Jaur√©guiberry steaming at high speed, probably on her sea trials Jaur√©guiberry was designed by Amable Lagane, the naval architect who had overseen the construction of one of the Magneta-class ironclads, and as a result, the ship was heavily influenced by the earlier vessel, particularly in the vessel's comparatively short and wide hull. The Chilean ironclad , then being built in the same shipyard and also designed by Lagane, also proved to be influential. Capit√°n Prats secondary battery was mounted in twin-gun turrets to save weight and space, and Lagane adopted that innovation for Jaur√©guiberry, the first time such an arrangement was used on a French battleship. Like her other French contemporaries, she was unstable and suffered from poor seakeeping, a result of their limited displacement. As with the other battleships built during this period, Jaur√©guiberry had a relatively uneventful peacetime career. She suffered several minor accidents, including a pair of accidental explosions of torpedo compressed air chambers in 1897 and 1905. Also in 1897, she joined Charles Martel and Carnot in the International Squadron for operations off Crete. In 1913, the ship was assigned to the Training Division, thereafter serving with the Special Division in 1914. After the outbreak of World War I, the ship was sent to cover troopship convoys from North Africa to France and was later stationed in the Syrian Division in early 1915. Jaur√©guiberry then joined the Dardanelles Division for operations against the Ottoman Empire, including supporting the Landing at Cape Helles in April 1915. She then returned to Syria, where she remained largely until 1918 when she was reduced to reserve status. Decommissioned in 1919, she was converted into a barracks ship in 1920 and was ultimately broken up in 1934. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Jaur√©guiberry class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1887 guns 2 √ó Canon de 274 mm Mod√®le 1887 guns    2 shafts, triple-expansion engines, 17.5 kn  23 April 1891  16 February 1897  Broken up, 1934 } =Mass√©na= Mass√©na in port, date unknown Mass√©na was designed by Louis de Bussy, who had also designed the revolutionary armored cruiser ; like the other members of the 1890 program, Mass√©na was built within the same displacement limitations and accordingly suffered from the same stability and seakeeping problems. She also retained the same lozenge arrangement of her half-sisters. The ship introduced one significant innovation to French capital ship design: the three-shaft arrangement for her propulsion system. All previous French capital ships had used two screws. She was also the first ship to mount the improved 1893 versions of the 305 mm and 274 mm main guns‚Äîalbeit of an experimental 45-caliber (cal.) version that was later reduced to 40-cal. in later vessels‚Äîthat was to equip all French battleships for more than a decade. The ship's career was uneventful; she served as the flagship of the Northern Squadron for her first years in service. In 1903, she was transferred to the Reserve Division of the Mediterranean Squadron. For the next several years, she was periodically reactivated to take part in training exercises with the rest of the fleet, before being reduced to reserve again in 1913. Hulked in 1915, Mass√©na was ultimately scuttled in January 1916 to form a breakwater to protect the vessels that evacuated the Allied army that had been defeated in the Gallipoli campaign. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align: center;\\" + Summary of the Mass√©na class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns 2 √ó Canon de 274 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns    3 shafts, triple-expansion engines, 17 kn  September 1892  June 1898  Scuttled, 9 November 1915 } =Bouvet= Bouvet, date unknown Bouvet was the last and most successful member of the 1890 program; she was the third vessel designed by Huin. He used the experience gathered with Charles Martel to produce an improved version in an attempt to correct the faults of the other vessels ordered under the program. Bouvets superstructure was smaller than the other vessels, and though she was not as top-heavy as the other ships, she still had insufficient stability, which contributed to her eventual loss in 1915. This was largely a result of the pronounced tumblehome and an insufficiently subdivided hull that was not able to cope with underwater damage. The ship was the first major French warship to be completed with an integrated fire-control system that coordinated the rangefinders, observers, and the gun crews with a central command post to direct the aiming of her main guns. Bouvet spent her career in the Mediterranean Squadron, occupied primarily with training exercises and cruises. In 1903, she was involved in a collision with the battleship that saw both vessels slightly damaged and both ships' captains relieved of duty. She assisted with relief efforts after Mount Vesuvius erupted in 1906 and the following year she was transferred to the 2nd Battle Squadron, part of what was then the Mediterranean Fleet. Unlike her four half-sisters, she remained in active service with the fleet at the outbreak of World War I, and after covering convoys from North Africa, she was sent to the Dardanelles. From February to March 1915, she participated in several attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications guarding the straits, culminating in a major attempt to force the straits on 18 March. During the battle, Bouvet was heavily engaged by Ottoman artillery, suffered eight hits, but had neutralized one fortress's guns before she struck a naval mine that caused uncontrolled flooding. She capsized and sank with heavy loss of life; 24 officers and 619 enlisted men were killed in the sinking. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align: center;\\" + Summary of the Bouvet class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns 2 √ó Canon de 274 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns  400 mm   3 shafts, triple-expansion engines, 18 kn  16 January 1893  June 1898  Sunk during operations off the Dardanelles on 18 March 1915 } =Charlemagne class= Gaulois underway before World War I The Minister of the Navy, Auguste Burdeau, instructed the naval design staff to prepare a new battleship proposal that was limited to in 1892. The weight reduction was to be achieved be returning to twin-gun turrets for the main battery, which would halve the number of turrets and thus reduce the weight that would be expended armoring them. Burdeau initially suggested a battery of two 305 mm guns in a turret forward and two 274 mm guns in a turret aft, but it was determined that the smaller gun would be incapable of penetrating the armor on the latest British battleships, so a uniform battery of 305 mm guns was adopted. The Navy requested several proposals for the new ships, but negative experience with the experimental series of battleships ordered under the 1890 program led to a decision to build three ships to the same plan. During the design process, the various designers found it difficult to stay within the 11,000-ton limit while incorporating the necessary offensive and defensive characteristics. The naval command accepted the growth of the design and in 1893 selected the proposal prepared by Jules Thibaudier, the director of the Arsenal de Rochefort shipyard, with construction beginning on the first of three vessels later that year. The first two ships‚ÄîGaulois and ‚Äîwere briefly assigned to the Northern Squadron before being moved to the Mediterranean Squadron in 1899, where they were joined by the next year. The last member of the class became the squadron flagship. The ships were involved in a number of accidents: Gaulois collided with the destroyer in 1900 and Bouvet in 1903, Saint Louis was struck by the destroyer and rammed the submarine in 1911 and 1912, respectively. The new battleship replaced Saint Louis as the flagship in 1904, and the three Charlemagnes were moved to the North Sea in 1909 and returned to the Mediterranean in 1912. They escorted convoys at the start of World War I and later took part in the Dardanelles campaign, where Gaulois was badly damaged by Ottoman artillery fire. Gaulois was later torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in 1916 and the other two vessels saw little activity thereafter, being withdrawn from service in mid-1917. Charlemagne was sold for scrap in 1923, while Saint Louis remained in the navy's inventory as a barracks ship until 1931, when she was struck from the naval register and sold two years later. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Charlemagne class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  4 √ó Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns  rowspan=\\"3\\"  400 mm  rowspan=\\"3\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  3 shafts, triple- expansion engines, 18 kn  2 August 1894  12 September 1899  Broken up, 1923 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   25 March 1895  1 September 1900  Broken up, 1933 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   6 January 1896  15 January 1899  Sunk by UB-47, 27 December 1916 } =I√©na= Postcard depicting I√©na on her sea trials The Board of Construction requested an improved version of the Charlemagne class in 1897, which was to correct the stability problems that perennially plagued French battleships of the period. The Navy Minister asked Thibaudier to design a larger version of the ship, with displacement increased to 12,000 t, as the naval staff had determined that, like the ships of the 1890 program, the Charlemagnes represented an attempt to fit too much into a limited displacement. Thibaudier prepared the next design, which was in many respects a simple repeat of the Charlemagnes, incorporating relatively minor improvements, including a more effective armor layout (the result of using Harvey armor to reduce the thickness but not the effectiveness of armor) and a heavier secondary battery. I√©na retained the pronounced tumblehome of the earlier French battleships, which was a primary cause of the ships' poor stability. She was nevertheless a good sea-boat and very maneuverable. On entering service, I√©na became the flagship of the 2nd Battle Division in the Mediterranean Squadron. She thereafter embarked on the routine of training exercises and cruises with the rest of the fleet. Her career passed uneventfully, apart from a collision with a torpedo boat off Toulon in 1906 that resulted in the latter's sinking. The ship's career was cut short in March 1907 when, while in drydock in Toulon, a magazine explosion destroyed the ship. An investigation blamed Poudre B, the smokeless propellant used by the French Navy for its shells. The wreck was repaired to make her watertight and was refloated in 1909 for use as a target ship, being partially broken up between 1913 and 1914 off Porquerolles, though parts of the ship remained there until 1957 when final demolition was completed. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the I√©na class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   4 √ó Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns    3 shafts, triple-expansion engines, 17 kn  15 January 1898  14 April 1902  Destroyed by magazine explosion, 12 March 1907 } =Suffren= Painting of Suffren off the Dardanelles in 1915 The Navy Minister issued a request for a new battleship in 1898 that was to be an improved version of the basic Charlemagne/I√©na design. The funding for the ship had already been authorized and so displacement was limited to the same as that of I√©na. As a result, Thibaudier was constrained in what he could accomplish with the design, and so he considered improvements to stability, the caliber and arrangement of the secondary battery, and the armor layout of the hull. He considered the use of twin-gun turrets for the secondary battery, but concerns over the risk that damage would disable two guns rather than just one and the arrangement for effective fields of fire led the command to reject them. Requests from the various technical sections of the French Navy for increased ammunition storage, improved armor for the secondary battery, and accommodations for a flag officer and his staff complicated Thibaudier's task. As a result of the competing requests, the secondary battery could only be strengthened by the addition of a pair of guns. Increases in the ship's length necessitated improvements to the Arsenal de Brest shipyard before work could begin. Suffren became the flagship of the 1st Battle Division after her commissioning. Her peacetime career was marked by a number of accidents: she collided with Saint Louis in 1905 and the submarine in 1906, nearly sinking the latter. She was moored next to I√©na when the latter vessel exploded in 1907; the blast hurled burning fragments that set Suffren on fire. She broke her starboard propeller shaft while underway in 1910 and lost power during maneuvers in 1911 and collided with the battleship , though she was not seriously damaged in any of these incidents. During World War I, she took part in the Dardanelles campaign through the end of 1915. In 1916, she joined the main French fleet in Greek waters, where she saw little activity. While en route to Lorient for a refit in November 1916, she was torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat off the coast of Portugal, killing her entire crew. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the I√©na class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   4 √ó Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns    3 shafts, triple- expansion engines, 17 kn  5 January 1899  3 February 1904  Sunk by , 26 November 1916 } =R√©publique class= Illustration of Patrie The two R√©publique-class ships were ordered under the 1900 Fleet Law, which was a reaction to the German 1898 Naval Law; the French law called for six new battleships, which were initially to be a homogeneous class. Louis-√âmile Bertin prepared the design for the new ships, with an allowed displacement of up to , a major increase over earlier vessels. Bertin correctly perceived the flaws of the narrow belt armor of earlier French battleships, and so designed what was to become R√©publique with a more comprehensive arrangement. Developments with heavier secondary batteries abroad, particularly with the British s, led to the last four ships being redesigned with more powerful secondary guns, resulting in four-ship . Like many late French pre- dreadnoughts, their lengthy design and construction periods resulted in their completion after the revolutionary British \\"all-big-gun\\" battleship . Both vessels served with the Mediterranean Fleet throughout their careers, initially with the 1st Squadron and, after the ships entered service, with the 2nd Squadron. They took part in convoy escort operations in the first days of World War I and then deployed to the southern Adriatic Sea to engage the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Austro-Hungarians refused to take the bait, and the French only caught the small protected cruiser , which they sank in the Battle of Antivari. and were later involved in Allied efforts to force Greece to enter the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, which ultimately succeeded in 1917. R√©publique was partially disarmed in early 1918 to provide guns for the French Army and thereafter became a training ship, but Patrie remained in service until 1919, when she, too, was reduced to a training role. The lead ship was sold for scrap in 1921, but Patrie was retained for training purposes until 1936, when she was finally decommissioned and sold the following year. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the R√©publique class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  4 √ó Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893 guns  rowspan=\\"2\\"    rowspan=\\"2\\"  3 shafts, triple-expansion engines, 18 kn  27 December 1901  12 January 1907  Broken up, 1921 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"    1 April 1902  1 July 1907  Broken up, 1937 } =Libert√© class= Justice at the Hudson‚ÄìFulton Celebration in September 1909 Initially meant to be identical to the R√©publiques, the four Libert√©-class ships were redesigned after foreign battleships began to carry heavier secondary guns; these included the British King Edward VII class, armed with secondaries, which were in turn a response to American and Italian battleships armed with guns. Accordingly, the Naval General Staff requested the last four members of the 1900 program to be redesigned to carry 194 mm guns. Ironically, Bertin had suggested the exact same caliber during the initial design process, which the General Staff rejected over fears that the rate of fire would fall. The two classes were otherwise nearly identical, which has led some historians, including John Jordan and Philippe Caresse, to consider them to be one class with two variants. The four ships' service history largely mirrored that of the R√©publique class. In 1909, , , and traveled to the United States for the Hudson‚ÄìFulton Celebration and, in 1911, they joined the R√©publiques in the 2nd Squadron. In September that year, Libert√© was destroyed by an accidental explosion while moored in Toulon; the cause of the blast was determined to be the same unstable Poudre B that had destroyed I√©na in 1907. Along with their squadron mates, the three surviving Libert√©s escorted convoys early in World War I and took part in the Battle of Antivari. V√©rit√© briefly took part in operations against the Ottomans in November and December, and later took part in the operations in Greece in 1916 and early 1917. After securing Greece's alliance, the ships returned to the fleet's main wartime anchorage at Corfu, where it remained for the rest of the war. Immediately after the German surrender, Justice and D√©mocratie were sent to the Black Sea to oversee German demilitarization and then to take part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. War-weary sailors later mutinied in several vessels and forced the French to withdraw in 1919.

By this time, France had concluded the Entente Cordiale with Britain, and the increasingly powerful German fleet was viewed as the most significant threat; the program of 1906 called for a total of sixteen new battleships to be built by 1919 to counter the Germans. In an effort to control the cost of the next ships to be built, the Minister of the Navy, Gaston Thomson, imposed a limit of . The design staff began its work in the aftermath of the Battle of Tsushima; the French Navy determined that Japanese success in the battle had been the result of the high speed of their ships and the large number of medium-caliber guns that inflicted significant damage to the unarmored superstructures of the Russian warships. As a result, the navy decided to adopt a heavier secondary battery than the preceding Libert√©s, but decided against following many other major navies then building \\"all-big-gun\\" battleships. The naval command determined that replacing the planned guns with single 305 mm guns would have increased displacement over the limit and reduced the rate of fire. The navy did introduce a new, longer 45-cal. version of the 305 mm gun, the Mod√®le 1906 type. Pressure from Parliament to keep technological pace with foreign navies led the designers to adopt steam turbines, the first time they were used in French capital ships. The navy had initially intended to build three ships as the first stage of the program, but delays during the design process led to the authorization of six ships to account for the slowdown. After entering service in 1911, all six ships were assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron, where they remained until the outbreak of World War I. Like the rest of the fleet, they escorted convoys from North Africa at the start of the war and then went to the Adriatic, seeing action at the Battle of Antivari, with the exception of , which was being refitted in Toulon at the time. The six Dantons remained based at Corfu and Malta for much of the war to blockade the Austro-Hungarian fleet. During this period, portions of the ships' crews were stripped to provide men for anti-submarine warships to combat the German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats; combined with coal shortages that curtailed operations, the reduction in crews led to crippling morale problems for the fleet. In March 1917, was sunk by a German U-boat. After the war, the surviving ships participated in the intervention in Russia in 1919 and Mirabeau was damaged after running aground off the Crimea; she was never repaired and was eventually broken up. The other vessels were modernized in the early 1920s, with the exception of , which was in poor condition. They continued on in secondary roles into the 1930s, and remained in use as a depot ship until 1942, when she was captured by German forces in Toulon, ultimately being bombed and sunk in 1944. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Danton class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"6\\"  4 √ó 305mm/45 Mod√®le 1906 guns  rowspan=\\"6\\"   rowspan=\\"6\\"   rowspan=\\"6\\"  4 shafts, steam turbines,  9 January 1908  24 July 1911  Sunk by on 19 March 1917 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   23 August 1907  25 July 1911  Sunk, August 1944 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   20 October 1907  25 July 1911  Broken up, 1937 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   4 May 1908  1 August 1911  Broken up, 1928 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   July 1908  18 December 1911  Broken up, 1928 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 June 1907  5 August 1911  Broken up, 1949 } Dreadnought battleships =Courbet class= Jean Bart in 1913 The French naval command had become convinced by 1909 that the so-called dreadnought battleships were superior to the mixed-battery ships like the Dantons, and so the new naval minister, Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re, instructed the design staff to prepare an all-big-gun proposal. Displacement was limited to , which corresponded to contemporary foreign dreadnoughts. Consideration was given to uniform batteries of 240, 274, and 305 mm guns; the Technical Section prepared three designs, the first of which was essentially a repeat Danton with increased ammunition storage, the second was a Danton variant with the six 240 mm wing turrets replaced by four 305 mm turrets, bringing the total number of guns to twelve. The turrets were arranged in a superfiring pair forward, two wing turrets amidships, and another superfiring pair aft. The third version included a mix of twin and triple turrets, but Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re ordered a modified version of the second proposal, and the first two ships were ordered for the 1910 budget. Two more followed in 1911. Three of the four ships were completed shortly before World War I, and and carried President Raymond Poincar√© on a visit to Russia during the July Crisis, the proximate cause of the war. The ships operated with the main fleet during the conflict and saw little activity after the Battle of Antivari; they suffered the same fate as the Dantons, with crews being thinned to provide men for more important vessels. France and Jean Bart were involved in the intervention in Russia in 1919 and after returning to France later that year, were assigned to the new Western Mediterranean Squadron. In 1922 France struck an uncharted rock in Quiberon Bay and sank. The three surviving ships were refitted in the late 1920s and early 1930s. They thereafter served in secondary roles, including as training ships and later as barracks ships. remained in service as a training vessel early in World War II and she shelled German forces during the Battle of France in June 1940 before fleeing to Britain and eventually being sunk as a breakwater for the Normandy invasion. Jean Bart, which had been renamed Oc√©an in 1937, was seized by the Germans in 1942 and used for weapons tests before being bombed and sunk in 1944. Paris, the last surviving member of the class, was also evacuated to Britain after the German invasion and was used as a depot ship first in Britain and then in France until 1955. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Courbet class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"4\\"  12 √ó 305mm/45 Mod√®le 1906 guns  rowspan=\\"4\\"  250 mm  rowspan=\\"4\\"   rowspan=\\"4\\"  4 shafts, steam turbines,  1 September 1910  19 November 1913  Sunk as a breakwater, 9 June 1944 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   15 November 1910  19 November 1913  Broken up, 1945 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   10 November 1911  1 August 1914  Broken up, 1956 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   30 November 1911  10 October 1914  Wrecked, 1922 } =Bretagne class= Provence after her modernization in the mid-1930s The Bretagne class was modeled on the preceding Courbet class, using the same hull design as a result of the size constraints of French shipyards. Design work began before the Courbets had been ordered, and the emphasis was on increasing the caliber of the main battery to match foreign development of the so-called superdreadnought type such as the British . The naval high command initially specified a maximum displacement of and a main battery of twelve guns. The 340 mm turrets were significantly heavier than the 305 mm versions used in the Courbets, and the design staff found it impossible to retain six turrets within the prescribed displacement. They submitted a five-turret design, removing one of the wing turrets and moving the other to the centerline amidships, which kept the same ten-gun broadside. In addition, the belt armor was reduced slightly to accommodate for the greater weight of the main battery. A new naval law was passed in 1912 that projected a fleet of twenty-eight battleships by 1920; three ships were authorized for the 1912 budget, which became the Bretagnes. Upon completion, the ships were assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron and sent to join the fleet at Corfu; by this point, the fleet had settled into the blockade of the southern Adriatic and so the Bretagnes saw little activity during the war. The ships spent the 1920s and 1930s in the Mediterranean and Atlantic Squadrons, undergoing periodic refits and modernizations, and in the late 1930s, they took part in the non-intervention patrols off Spain during the Spanish Civil War. After the start of World War II, they operated as convoy escorts in the Atlantic and in 1940, as war with Italy became increasingly likely, they were concentrated with the bulk of the French fleet in the Mediterranean as a deterrent. and were in Mers El K√©bir when Germany defeated France in June 1940, and during a British operation to neutralize the French fleet, were attacked in the port by the British Force H. Bretagne was destroyed and Provence was badly damaged, later being refloated and returned to Toulon for repairs, where she was scuttled in 1942 to prevent her capture by the Germans. Meanwhile, was seized by the British while she was moored in Alexandria, Egypt and then turned over to the Free French Naval Forces. She saw action during the last years of the war bombarding German forces in occupied France. After the war, she was used as a training vessel and later a barracks ship, ultimately being scrapped in 1953. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Bretagne class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  10 √ó 340mm/45 Mod√®le 1912 guns  rowspan=\\"3\\"  250 mm  rowspan=\\"3\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  4 shafts, steam turbines, 21 kn  22 July 1912  10 February 1916  Sunk at the Attack on Mers-el-K√©bir, 3 July 1940 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   21 April 1912  1 March 1916  Broken up, 1949 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   7 November 1912  10 March 1916  Broken up, 1953 } =Normandie class= An artist's depiction of the Normandie class Before work on the Bretagne class had even begun, the French Navy's Technical Committee issued a report in late 1911 criticizing the decision to adopt a centerline, amidships turret based on previous experience with ships in the 1880s; the center turret inflicted excessive blast damage on the superstructure. Work on the next design began in early 1912 and three initial versions were prepared; the first was essentially a repeat of Bretagne but the other two attempted a radical solution to the problem identified by the Technical Committee. To avoid the central turret, they proposed a new quadruple turret; the first variant used two of these turrets, each with a twin-turret superfiring above them, and the second incorporated four quadruple turrets with 305 mm guns. The General Staff decided to retain the 340 mm gun and preferred the quadruple turret if development could be completed in time, ultimately settling on a finalized version equipped with three quadruple turrets, one forward and two aft. The 1912 naval law had initially called for two ships to be ordered in 1913 and two more in 1914, but an amendment increased the pace to four in 1913 and a fifth in 1914, owing to the increased tension in Europe during this period. The first two ships were ordered in April 1913, followed by two more in July, and a fifth vessel in January 1914. Work was halted after the outbreak of war, as resources were diverted to more critical projects for the Army and to complete the Bretagnes, then much further along in construction. Much of the material that had been assembled for the ships was used for other purposes, including boilers to replace those of older vessels, and main guns converted into railway guns for the Army. After the war, the first four ships were cancelled and parts of those vessels were used to complete as an aircraft carrier. She remained in service during World War II and the French Indochina War and was ultimately scrapped in 1967. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Normandie class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Normandie  rowspan=\\"5\\"  12 √ó 340 mm /45 Mod√®le 1912 guns  rowspan=\\"5\\"  300 mm  rowspan=\\"5\\"   rowspan=\\"5\\"  4 shafts, triple-expansion engines and steam turbines, 21 kn  18 April 1913  rowspan=\\"4\\"  ‚Äî  Broken up, 1924 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Flandre  1 October 1913  Broken up, 1924 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Gascogne  1 October 1913  Broken up, 1923 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Languedoc  1 May 1913  Broken up, 1929 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   5 January 1914  May 1927  Broken up, 1967 } =Lyon class= One variant of the Lyon design as depicted in the Journal of United States Artillery The amendment to the 1912 naval law called for four ships to be ordered in 1915. Design work for the new vessels began in mid-1913, and since longer graving docks would soon be completed in Brest and Toulon, the new ships would not be limited by infrastructure. The naval command considered increasing the caliber to to keep pace with the latest British battleships of the , but the French did not yet have a gun of that caliber completed, and the delays necessary to design and test it were deemed unacceptable. Additionally, the French expected to be fighting at ranges where the existing 340 mm gun was able to defeat heavy armor, so there was little need to step up to the larger caliber. The 340 mm gun was adopted, but to improve the ships' firepower, a fourth quadruple turret was added. The ships were allocated to shipyards in late 1913, with work to begin on the first two in January 1915, with the second pair to follow at an unspecified time. Work to complete the design continued into 1914, but the details of the ships' underwater protection system had not yet been finalized by the time war broke out in August 1914. With the start of the war, the project was cancelled; no work was done and no material was assembled for the vessels. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Lyon class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Lyon  rowspan=\\"4\\"  16 √ó 340 mm /45 Mod√®le 1912 guns  rowspan=\\"4\\"  300 mm  rowspan=\\"4\\"   rowspan=\\"4\\"  4 shafts, unknown type, 21 kn  rowspan=\\"4\\"  ‚Äî  rowspan=\\"4\\"  ‚Äî  rowspan=\\"4\\"  ‚Äî - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Duquesne - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Lille - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Tourville } Fast battleships =Dunkerque class= Prewar photo of Dunkerque In the early 1920s, the major naval powers concluded the Washington Naval Treaty to limit battleship construction; under the terms of the treaty, France was limited to a total of of battleship tonnage. All members of the treaty system were barred from building battleships for a decade, apart from France and Italy, both of which had allotted, since their fleets consisted of older vessels. Financial weakness after the war, coupled with indecision over what type of ship to build delayed the construction of new French battleships. The navy initially conceived of small, fast battleships to counter new Italian heavy cruisers that threatened France's lines of communication in the Mediterranean. The advent of the German s, armed with guns, necessitated larger, more capable battleships, with armor heavy enough to defeat the German large-caliber guns. This process eventually produced the Dunkerque class. and were commissioned in the late 1930s; they spent the majority of their peacetime years conducting training. Following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 that started World War II, the ships were initially used as part of the Force de Raid (Raiding Force) to hunt down German commerce raiders and to escort convoys. The ships were moored in Mers El K√©bir to deter Italy from joining the war when Germany defeated France in May and June 1940, and were to be demilitarized there under the terms of the Armistice of 22 June 1940. Concerned that the Germans would seize the French fleet, the British launched Operation Catapult to neutralize the vessels; during the attack on Mers-el-K√©bir, Force H damaged Dunkerque but Strasbourg was able to escape the harbor and reach Toulon. After a second attack that sank her, Dunkerque was refloated and returned to Toulon as well, before both ships were ultimately scuttled in the harbor to prevent the Germans from seizing them in 1942. Both vessels were eventually broken up in the 1950s. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Dunkerque class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  8 √ó /50 Mod√®le 1931 guns    rowspan=\\"2\\"  4 shafts, steam turbines,  24 December 1932  31 December 1936  Broken up, 1958 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"     24 November 1934  15 September 1938  Broken up, 1955 } =Richelieu class= Richelieu after being refitted in the United States in 1943 The Italian response to the Dunkerques, the first two s, which displaced and were armed with nine 380 mm guns, prompted France to respond in kind. The French considered a scaled-up version of the Dunkerque design armed with eight 380 mm or guns, or a version with three triple- turrets. The design staff quickly determined that the weight of the 406 mm battery would preclude the other technical requirements for the ships and decided that 380 mm was the largest caliber that could be carried in the specified displacement. The design was finalized by August 1935 and two ships were ordered and quickly laid down; because the ships were larger than the shipyards available, the builders adopted a plan to build the bulk of the hull on the slipway and then add bows and sterns after moving them to drydocks. Beginning construction of the ships in late 1935 placed France in violation of the naval arms treaty, as the total tonnage exceeded the 70,000 tons allowed before the building holiday expired in 1936. But the French government had objected to Britain failing to uphold its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles by signing a separate Anglo-German Naval Agreement earlier in 1935, which directly undermined the limitations of German armament imposed by Versailles. Two more ships, to be built to modified designs, were projected, but only Clemenceau was laid down before the start of the war. She was quickly cancelled, as was the fourth vessel, Gascogne. Neither or was ready in time to see action before France was defeated in 1940. Jean Bart was moved to Casablanca and Richelieu fled to Dakar before they could be captured by German forces. The latter was attacked by British forces in July and September to prevent her from being turned over to the Germans, but Jean Bart was far from complete and so was ignored. In November 1942, the Allies invaded French North Africa and Jean Bart initially fired on the invasion fleet before being disabled by the US battleship . After the invasion, which resulted in French forces in North Africa turning to Free France, Richelieu was sent to the United States to be completed and modernized. She thereafter served with the British Home Fleet in the Indian Ocean and later in French Indochina, where she ended the war. Jean Bart was finally completed after the war; both vessels continued on in service with the French fleet, primarily as training vessels, before being decommissioned in 1968 and broken up. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Richelieu class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"4\\"  8 √ó /45 Mod√®le 1935 guns  rowspan=\\"2\\"   rowspan=\\"4\\"   rowspan=\\"4\\"  4 shafts, steam turbines,  22 October 1935  1 April 1940  Broken up, 1968 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   12 December 1936  1 August 1949  Broken up, 1970 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Clemenceau  rowspan=\\"2\\"  320 mm  17 January 1939  ‚Äî  Broken up, 1951 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Gascogne  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî } =Alsace class= Illustration of one of the proposed Alsace designs with quadruple 380 mm guns After work on the Richelieus began and the international naval treaty system fell apart following Japan's and Italy's refusal to sign the Second London Naval Treaty, the French Navy began design studies on the next class of battleships that would take advantage of the escalator clause in the treaty that allowed displacement to be increased to and the main battery to be increased to 406 mm (the treaty had added a limit of guns). The design staff prepared several studies in 1939, all of which were derivatives of the three- turret design that had been drawn up during the Richelieu design process. The first variant had nine 380 mm guns in triple turrets, with slightly improved protection over the Richelieus and a more powerful secondary battery. The second version was essentially the same, but scaled up for 406 mm guns, and the third featured three quadruple 380 mm turrets. The navy settled on the first version, as the second variation would have introduced a fourth shell caliber to the fleet, thus complicating logistics, and the third design was too large and expensive. Two ships were authorized in April 1940, with construction to begin in 1941 after the aircraft carrier was launched, but following the French collapse in June, the program was cancelled. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Alsace class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Alsace  rowspan=\\"2\\"  9 √ó 380 mm /45 Mod√®le 1935 guns  rowspan=\\"2\\"  330 mm  rowspan=\\"2\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  Unknown, estimated  rowspan=\\"2\\"  ‚Äî  rowspan=\\"2\\"  ‚Äî  rowspan=\\"2\\"  ‚Äî - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Unnamed } See also * List of battleships Footnotes References          External links * Maritimequest French battleship photo index * Battleship France * ","title":"List of battleships of France"},{"id":"892609","text":"This is a list of Dutch battleships of the period 1894-1944.

Blast injuries occur with the detonation of high-order explosives as well as the deflagration of low order explosives. These injuries are compounded when the explosion occurs in a confined space. Classification Diagram of a blast injury Blast injuries are divided into four classes: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. =Primary injuries= Primary injuries are caused by blast overpressure waves, or shock waves. Total body disruption is the most severe and invariably fatal primary injury. Primary injuries are especially likely when a person is close to an exploding munition, such as a land mine. The ears are most often affected by the overpressure, followed by the lungs and the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal injuries may present after a delay of hours or even days. Injury from blast overpressure is a pressure and time dependent function. By increasing the pressure or its duration, the severity of injury will also increase. Extensive damage can also be inflicted upon the auditory system. The tympanic membrane (also known as the eardrum) may be perforated by the intensity of the pressure waves. Furthermore, the hair cells, the sound receptors found within the cochlea, can be permanently damaged and can result in a hearing loss of a mild to profound degree. Additionally, the intensity of the pressure changes from the blast can cause injury to the blood vessels and neural pathways within the auditory system. Therefore, affected individuals can have auditory processing deficits while having normal hearing thresholds. The combination of these effects can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus, headache, vertigo (dizziness), and difficulty processing sound. In general, primary blast injuries are characterized by the absence of external injuries; thus internal injuries are frequently unrecognized and their severity underestimated. According to the latest experimental results, the extent and types of primary blast-induced injuries depend not only on the peak of the overpressure, but also other parameters such as number of overpressure peaks, time-lag between overpressure peaks, characteristics of the shear fronts between overpressure peaks, frequency resonance, and electromagnetic pulse, among others. There is general agreement that spalling, implosion, inertia, and pressure differentials are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of primary blast injuries. Thus, the majority of prior research focused on the mechanisms of blast injuries within gas-containing organs and organ systems such as the lungs, while primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury has remained underestimated. Blast lung refers to severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding or swelling with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these. It is the most common cause of death among people who initially survive an explosion. =Secondary injuries= Secondary injuries are caused by fragmentation and other objects propelled by the explosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating trauma with visible bleeding. At times the propelled object may become embedded in the body, obstructing the loss of blood to the outside. However, there may be extensive blood loss within the body cavities. Fragmentation wounds may be lethal and therefore many anti- personnel bombs are designed to generate fragments. Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries as generally a larger geographic area is affected by this form of injury than the primary blast site as debris can easily be propelled for hundreds to thousands of meters. Some explosives, such as nail bombs, are deliberately designed to increase the likelihood of secondary injuries. In other instances, the target provides the raw material for the objects thrown into people, e.g., shattered glass from a blasted-out window or the glass facade of a building. =Tertiary injuries= Displacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Injuries resulting from this type of traumatic impact are referred to as tertiary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries may present as some combination of blunt and penetrating trauma, including bone fractures and coup contre-coup injuries. Children are at particularly high risk of tertiary injury due to their relatively smaller body weight. =Quaternary injuries= Quaternary injuries, or other miscellaneous named injuries, are all other injuries not included in the first three classes. These include flash burns, crush injuries, and respiratory injuries. Traumatic amputations quickly result in death, unless there are available skilled medical personnel or others with adequate training nearby who are able to quickly respond, with the ability for rapid ground or air medical evacuation to an appropriate facility in time, and with tourniquets (for compression of bleeding sites) and other needed equipment (standard, or improvised; sterile, or not) also available, to treat the injuries. Because of this, injuries of this type are generally rare, though not unheard of, in survivors. Whether survivable or not, they are often accompanied by significant other injuries. The rate of eye injury may depend on the type of blast. Psychiatric injury, some of which may be caused by neurological damage incurred during the blast, is the most common quaternary injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder may affect people who are otherwise completely uninjured. Mechanism Blast injuries can result from various types of incidents ranging from industrial accidents to deliberate attacks. High-order explosives produce a supersonic overpressure shock wave, while low order explosives deflagrate and do not produce an overpressure wave. A blast wave generated by an explosion starts with a single pulse of increased air pressure, lasting a few milliseconds. The negative pressure (suction) of the blast wave follows immediately after the positive wave. The duration of the blast wave depends on the type of explosive material and the distance from the point of detonation. The blast wave progresses from the source of explosion as a sphere of compressed and rapidly expanding gases, which displaces an equal volume of air at a very high velocity. The velocity of the blast wave in air may be extremely high, depending on the type and amount of the explosive used. An individual in the path of an explosion will be subjected not only to excess barometric pressure, but to pressure from the high-velocity wind traveling directly behind the shock front of the blast wave. The magnitude of damage due to the blast wave is dependent on the peak of the initial positive pressure wave, the duration of the overpressure, the medium in which it explodes, the distance from the incident blast wave, and the degree of focusing due to a confined area or walls. For example, explosions near or within hard solid surfaces become amplified two to nine times due to shock wave reflection. As a result, individuals between the blast and a building generally suffer two to three times the degree of injury compared to those in open spaces. Neurotrauma Blast injuries can cause hidden sensoryLawson, B. D., & Rupert, A. H. (2010).

It is a complex clinical syndrome caused by the combination of all blast effects, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary blast mechanisms. Blast injuries usually manifest in a form of polytrauma, i.e. injury involving multiple organs or organ systems. Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, reducing the amount of the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue or organs also contributes significantly to blast-induced neurotrauma. Individuals exposed to blast frequently manifest loss of memory of events before and after explosion, confusion, headache, impaired sense of reality, and reduced decision-making ability. Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring. However, the first symptoms of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) may occur months or even years after the initial event, and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries.Cernak, I., and L. J. Noble-Haeusslein. 2010. Traumatic brain injury: An overview of pathobiology with emphasis on military populations. J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 30(2):255-266. The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss, hormone imbalance, chronic fatigue, headache, and problems in memory, speech and balance. These changes are often debilitating, interfering with daily activities. Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation. Blast wave PTSD research In addition to known posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk factors experienced by both civilians and military personnel in combat areas; in early 2018, it was reported by 60 MinutesPelley, Scott \\"How IEDs may be physically causing PTSD\\"; 60 Minutes, 1 April 2018. that neuropathology specialist Dr. Daniel \\"Dan\\" Perl had conducted research on brain tissue exposed to traumatic brain injury (TBI), discovering a cause-and- effect relationship between IED blast waves and PTSD. Dr. Perl was recruited to the faculty of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences as a Professor of Pathology and to establish the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine mandated by Congress in 2008.USUHS Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine; Uniformed Services University; Bethesda, Maryland. Casualty estimates and triage Explosions in confined spaces or which cause structural collapse usually produce more deaths and injuries. Confined spaces include mines, buildings and large vehicles. For a rough estimate of the total casualties from an event, double the number that present in the first hour. Less injured patients often arrive first, as they take themselves to the nearest hospital. The most severely injured arrive later, via emergency services (\\"upside-down\\" triage). If there is a structural collapse, there will be more serious injuries that arrive more slowly.. Occasionally updated.

Early designs were marked by their small size, light armor, and high speed compared to contemporary foreign counterparts. The first pre-dreadnought battleship design, the , was constrained by budgetary limits imposed by the legislature. Two ships were ordered by the class's namesake, Admiral Simone de Pacoret Saint Bon, though the design was also influenced by Benedetto Brin, who replaced di Saint Bon as naval minister after his death. Brin designed the next pair of battleships, the . These ships were larger than the preceding class, and were intended to challenge the Austro-Hungarian s then under construction. Brin himself died during the construction process. Vittorio Cuniberti designed the next class of small pre-dreadnoughts, the , which were the fastest battleships in the world at the time of their completion.Gardiner, pp. 343‚Äì344Hore, pp. 78‚Äì81 These ships all served in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911‚Äì12,Beehler, p. 9 where they were primarily used to provide naval gunfire support for the Italian ground troops, as the Ottoman Navy largely confined itself to port.Beehler, pp. 27‚Äì29, 66‚Äì68, 74‚Äì76 By the time that the Regina Elenas had been built in the early 1900s, the British battleship had been completed, a revolutionary design that rendered all previous battleships obsolete. Therefore, a new dreadnought- type battleship was needed. The new ship was Dante Alighieri, and was designed by Rear Admiral Edoardo Masdea.Preston, p. 175 The Italian Navy built five further battleships to two similar designs: the and es. These six dreadnoughts formed the core of the Italian fleet during World War I, as a further four- ship class was cancelled.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 259‚Äì260 Both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies adopted cautious fleet policies and neither chose to risk their capital ships in a major engagement; as a result, the Italian battle line spent the war in harbor and did not see combat.Halpern, pp. 141‚Äì142 Nevertheless, the dreadnought Leonardo da Vinci was destroyed by a magazine explosion in August 1916.Whitley, pp. 157‚Äì158 The pre-dreadnought Benedetto Brin was also destroyed by an internal explosion in September 1915,Hocking, p. 79 and her sister Regina Margherita was sunk by a German mine in December 1916.Hocking, p. 583 The remaining battleships of the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and Regina Elena classes were discarded after the end of the war. In the interwar period, the Italian Navy‚Äîalong with the rest of the major naval powers‚Äîwas limited by the Washington Naval Treaty, which granted Italy parity with the French Navy.Whitley, pp. 169‚Äì170 The Italians had worth of battleship tonnage available for new vessels before they would reach their treaty limits, but they avoided new construction in the 1920s due to severe budgetary problems and to avoid a naval arms race with France.Garzke & Dulin, p. 374Goldstein & Maurer, p. 225 These financial limitations also forced the Italians to scrap Dante Alighieri in 1928. Nevertheless, the Regia Marina decided to make use of its excess tonnage by the early 1930s, which resulted in the four s. Two were finished early in World War II and were used extensively to escort convoys during the North African Campaign.Whitley, pp. 174‚Äì177 The third ship, Roma, was finished in 1942, but was sunk in September 1943 by a German radio-controlled bomb when Italy surrendered to the Allies.Whitley, p. 178 The fourth ship, Impero, was never finished and was instead sunk by American bombers and scrapped after the end of the war. The two surviving ships, Littorio and Vittorio Veneto, were surrendered to the Allies and were later broken up for scrap.Whitley, pp. 175‚Äì178 Of the surviving members of the Conte di Cavour class, Conte di Cavour was scrapped after the end of the war and Giulio Cesare was surrendered to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Only the two Andrea Doria-class battleships survived in Italian service for any significant length of time after the conclusion of hostilities; both served as training ships until the mid-1950s, when they too were broken up for scrap.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 259‚Äì260 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armament  The number and type of the primary armament - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armor  The thickness of the belt armor - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Displacement  Ship displacement at full combat load - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Propulsion  Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed/horsepower generated - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Service  The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Laid down  The date the keel began to be assembled - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Commissioned  The date the ship was commissioned } __TOC__ Pre-dreadnought battleships =Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class= Ammiraglio di Saint Bon underway The first of the Italian Navy's modern battleships, the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class were smaller than their contemporaries due to limitations imposed by the Italian government and indecision in the naval design staff over what kind of battleship should be built. They were designed under the supervision of Admiral Simone di Pacoret Saint Bon, the namesake of the lead ship, and Benedetto Brin. Ultimately, the ships' small size, weak main battery, and slow speed made them ineffective capital ships, since they were not strong enough to engage foreign battleships, and too slow to catch cruisers.Hore, p. 79 Both ships served in the active duty squadron early in their careers, and participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911‚Äì12. They took part in the Italian offensives in North Africa and the island of Rhodes, but did not see combat with the Ottoman fleet.Beehler, pp. 74‚Äì75 They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I, and spent the war in Venice. The ships were discarded shortly after the end of the war, both having been stricken in 1920. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  ShipGardiner, p. 343 ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Service ! - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  4 √ó guns  rowspan=\\"2\\"    rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 shafts, 2 triple expansion engines, ,  18 July 1893  24 May 1901  Discarded, 1920 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"    5 October 1893  16 April 1902  Discarded, 1920 } =Regina Margherita class= Regina Margherita on sea trials in 1904 The pattern of experimentation in Italian capital ship construction continued with the Regina Margherita class. The negative experience with the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class convinced the constructors, led by Benedetto Brin, to design a larger battleship that could engage its foreign counterparts. The new class was designed specifically to counter the new s of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. For this purpose, the ships were armed with the gun that had become standard for most pre-dreadnought battleships of the day. As was typical for Italian capital ships of the period, armor protection was reduced in order to secure high speed.Hore, pp. 79‚Äì80 Brin died during the construction process, and the Italian Navy named the second vessel after him. The two ships also saw action in the Italo-Turkish War, alongside the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class in the 3rd Division of the fleet. Benedetto Brin took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, and both ships were involved in the campaign to seize Rhodes in the eastern Aegean Sea.Beehler, pp. 66‚Äì68 The Regina Margherita class had become obsolete by the outbreak of World War I and had been reduced to training ships. Both were lost during the war: Benedetto Brin to an internal explosion in Brindisi in September 1915, and Regina Margherita to a German mine in December 1916. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Regina Margherita class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Service ! - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  4 √ó guns  rowspan=\\"2\\"    rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 shafts, 2 triple expansion engines, ,  20 November 1898  14 April 1904  Sunk, 1916 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"    30 January 1899  1 September 1905  Destroyed, 1915 } =Regina Elena class= Regina Elena at anchor The final class of Italian pre-dreadnoughts were designed by Vittorio Cuniberti, the naval architect whose projected design for the first \\"all-big- gun\\" battleship would quickly make the Regina Elena class obsolescent.

Cuniberti's call for heavy artillery arranged to emphasize broadside fire led to the placement of four triple 12-inch gun turrets along the centerline. This allowed a broadside of all twelve guns, while the first generation of British dreadnoughts could only fire eight of their guns on the broadside.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 21‚Äì23 Dante Alighieri was the first battleship to mount her main battery in triple turrets, though the Austro-Hungarian was completed first.Giorgerini, p. 268 The ship had a very limited service life. At the outbreak of World War I, she was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron, based in Taranto. But due to the policy of restraint adopted by the Italian Navy, Dante Alighieri and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial limitations in the post-war period forced the navy to scrap the ship to reduce the naval budget.Goldstein & Maurer, p. 226 The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Dante Alighieri class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  ShipGardiner & Gray, p. 259 ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Service ! - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   12 √ó 12 in guns  10 in   4 shafts, 4 geared turbines, ,  6 June 1909  15 January 1913  Discarded, 1928 } =Conte di Cavour class= Conte di Cavour as originally built The first design in the second generation of Italian dreadnoughts, the Conte di Cavour class was also designed by Edoardo Masdea. They were ordered in response to the French s. They remedied many of the deficiencies of the previous design; the most significant improvement was a dramatically more effective arrangement of the main battery. Ten guns were arranged in twin turrets superfiring over triple turrets forward and aft, and a third triple turret was placed amidships.Giorgerini, pp. 268‚Äì270, 272 All thirteen guns could fire on the broadside, but the firing arcs for most of the guns were significantly improved. The three ships had limited careers during World War I, and did not see action.Georgerini, p. 277 On the night of 2/3 August 1916, Leonardo da Vinci was sunk by an internal explosion.

The class comprised two vessels‚ÄîAndrea Doria and Caio Duilio‚Äîand the design was based on the previous Conte di Cavour with minor modifications. These two ships were ordered in response to the French .Giorgerini, p. 278 As with the Conte di Cavours, the two Andrea Doria-class battleships were significantly modernized in the late 1930s along similar lines: the central turret was removed, the propulsion system was completely replaced with more efficient machinery, and the secondary battery was replaced with new turret- mounted guns.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 284Fraccaroli, p. 16 The two ships entered service in 1916, and were based in Taranto with the rest of the main fleet for the duration of World War I. Both ships were involved in the Corfu incident in 1923.Whitley, pp. 165, 167 The ships' modernization work was completed after Italy entered World War II. Caio Duilio was damaged at the Battle of Taranto, while Andrea Doria was not hit. Both ships were present at the First Battle of Sirte, though only Andrea Doria engaged British forces.Whitley, pp. 166, 168 The two ships survived the war, and were the only battleships the Allies permitted Italy to retain after the conclusion of hostilities.

The design was prepared by Rear Admiral Edgardo Ferrati, and was intended to match the latest foreign battleships, such as the British . The new ships were to be armed with a main battery of eight guns and had a top speed of , much faster than any contemporary design. The Francesco Caracciolo class was ordered in 1914; the lead ship was laid down that year, and the other three vessels were laid down in 1915. After Italy entered World War I in May 1915, work slowed dramatically, as resources were diverted to more pressing needs. Work on the ships stopped completely by March 1916, and the three ships begun in 1915 were scrapped shortly after the end of the war. In 1919, the Italian Navy considered completing Francesco Caracciolo as an aircraft carrier similar to the British or as a floatplane carrier, but both proposals were too expensive for the cash-strapped navy.Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 63 Ultimately, she was broken up for scrap in 1926.Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 67 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Francesco Caracciolo class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Service ! - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" Francesco Caracciolo  rowspan=\\"4\\"  8 √ó guns  rowspan=\\"4\\"   rowspan=\\"4\\"   rowspan=\\"4\\"  4 shafts, 4 geared turbines, ,  16 October 1914  rowspan=\\"4\\"  ‚Äî Scrapped, 1926 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Cristoforo Colombo  14 March 1915  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Discarded, 1921 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Marcantonio Colonna  3 March 1915 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  Francesco Morosini  27 June 1915 } =Littorio class= CG rendering of The final group of Italian battleships was the Littorio class. These ships, which weighed in excess of standard displacement, violated the naval arms limitation system created by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.Stille, p. 23Whitley, p. 169 The ships were armed with a battery of nine 15-inch guns in three triple turrets, and they incorporated a novel underwater protection system designed by Umberto Pugliese.Gardiner & Chesneau, pp. 289‚Äì290 Littorio and Vittorio Veneto were laid down in 1934 and completed in early 1940; a second pair, Roma and Impero, were laid down in 1938. Roma was finished in mid-1942, while Impero was not completed. The first two ships entered service in August 1940, shortly after Italy joined World War II. Littorio was badly damaged in the November 1940 raid on Taranto, and repairs lasted until March 1941. Vittorio Veneto was undamaged, and later that month took part in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. In March 1941, she was damaged by British torpedo bombers after the inconclusive Battle of Cape Matapan. Both ships were back in action for the First and Second Battle of Sirte in January and March 1942, respectively. By the end of the year, Roma was ready for service and replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship. After Benito Mussolini fell from power in July 1943, Littorio was renamed Italia. During the Italian surrender in September 1943, Roma was hit by a pair of Fritz-X guided glide bombs; her ammunition magazines blew up in a tremendous explosion and she quickly sank. Italia was hit by one Fritz-X and was badly damaged. The United States and Britain received Italia and Vittorio Veneto, respectively, in the peace treaty; both ships were scrapped in the late 1940s, as was the incomplete Impero.Whitley, pp. 172‚Äì178 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Littorio class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  ShipGardiner & Chesneau, p. 289 ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Service ! - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" /Italia  rowspan=\\"4\\"  9 √ó 15 in guns  rowspan=\\"4\\"    rowspan=\\"4\\"  4 shafts, 4 geared turbines, ,  28 October 1934  6 May 1940  Scrapped, 1948‚Äì55 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"    28 October 1934  28 April 1940  Scrapped, 1948‚Äì51 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"    18 September 1938  14 June 1942  Sunk, 1943 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"    14 May 1938  ‚Äî  Scrapped, 1948‚Äì50 } See also * List of battleships * List of ironclad warships of Italy * List of ships of the line of Italy Notes References       Category:Battleships of Italy Italy Battleships ","title":"List of battleships of Italy"},{"id":"892617","text":"The Nez Perce National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park comprising 38 sites located throughout the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington, which included traditional aboriginal lands of the Nez Perce people. The sites are strongly associated with the resistance of Chief Joseph and his band, who in June 1877 took off from Oregon in an attempt to reach freedom in Canada and avoid being forced on to a reservation. They were pursued by U.S. Army cavalry forces and fought numerous skirmishes against them. The park was established in 1965, and a museum was opened at the park headquarters in Spalding, Idaho, in 1983. The 38 sites span three main ecoregions, covering a wide range of elevations and climate. Numerous animal species inhabit the park, including several that are considered sensitive. History The park commemorates the history, culture, and stories of the Nez Perce. It includes sites associated with the Nez Perce War of 1877, when the people resisted takeover by the United States, and the flight of Chief Joseph and his band. The park is administered overall by the National Park Service, and a number of the sites are managed by other federal and state agencies as well as local communities; the park's headquarters are located in Spalding, Idaho, east of Lewiston. The park was established by Congress in 1965. Construction of the planned headquarters site and museum at Spalding were delayed by land acquisition and federal funding Soon after construction began in September 1979, Native American graves were discovered at the site. Remains and artifacts were preserved in consultation with the Nez Perce. Construction of the visitor center and museum was later restarted. The museum opened Sites The Nez Perce National Historic Park does not follow the format of most national parks, in that it is composed of dozens of sites spread over four states. The 38 sites are linked by the history of the Nez Perce people, rather than by geographic location. Twenty-six of the sites are on or near the Nez Perce Indian Reservation in Idaho and can be toured in one day. Adjacent states hold the other twelve sites. Several of the sites are connected by the Nez Perce National Historic Trail, managed by the United States Forest Service. It preserves the route taken by Chief Joseph and his band when they tried to reach Canada in 1877. The sites include: * Battle of Bear Paw ‚Äì Blaine County, Montana * Battle of the Clearwater ‚Äì Idaho County, Idaho * Battle of White Bird Canyon ‚Äì Idaho County, Idaho * Big Hole National Battlefield ‚Äì Beaverhead County, Montana * Camas Meadows Battle Sites ‚Äì Clark County, Idaho * Camas Prairie ‚Äì Idaho County and Lewis County, Idaho * Camp Chopunnish ‚Äì Idaho County, Idaho * Joseph Canyon ‚Äì Wallowa County, Oregon and Asotin County, Washington * Old Chief Joseph Gravesite ‚Äì Wallowa County, Oregon * Weippe Prairie ‚Äì Weippe, Idaho Ecology The NPNHP sites cover three main ecoregions. The first, found at the sites in the Palouse grasslands and Missouri Basin, is shortgrass prairie. These flat or slightly rolling prairies include rivers and streams, and have an altitude of about . The second, found in the plateaus of the Columbia and Snake rivers, is sagebrush steppe at around 3,000 ft in altitude; it includes lava fields and flows. The third, found in the sites in the Blue Mountains, Salmon River Mountains, southwestern Montana and northern Rocky Mountains, is conifer and alpine meadows. These high-elevation sites have lower temperatures and greater precipitation than the other ecoregions. Numerous species of mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds and invertebrates inhabit the various park sites. Several of these species are classified in terms of their status as \\"threatened,\\" \\"endangered\\" or \\"sensitive\\" at the state level. Montana Arctic grayling, mountain plover, swift fox, great grey owl, boreal owl and several fish species are all sensitive species that inhabit the park, while gray wolf and bald eagles are sometimes seen. Managers of the park have several ecological concerns including issues of invasive plant species, the degradation of animal habitat due to human activity, the protection of endangered species, and dealing with effects of climate change.

It was one of two operating companies of CSX Corporation, the other being Chessie System. Since the late 1960s, the Seaboard Coast Line and its sister railroads had been known as the \\"Family Lines System,\\" sharing common ownership while operating under different names when conducting business. On July 1, 1986, Seaboard and Chessie merged into CSX. History The Seaboard System's roots trace back to SCL Industries, a holding company created in 1968 that combined the SCL's subsidiary railroads into one entity. In 1969, SCL was renamed Seaboard Coast Line Industries. Known as the Family Lines System, this entity adopted its own logo and colors, but each railroad maintained its own identity. Over time, this caused confusion among customers. In comparison to the neighboring Chessie System, which had three railroads, the Family Lines had five railroads. In 1971 SCL bought out the remaining shares and made the Louisville & Nashville a subsidiary. On November 1, 1980, the holding company CSX Corporation was created after the merger of Seaboard Coast Lines Industries and Chessie System. This now simplified ownership of both the Chessie and Seaboard's railroads under one holding company while still keeping their identities separate. On December 29, 1982, the Seaboard Coast Line and Louisville & Nashville (under the Family Lines entity) were merged to form the Seaboard System Railroad, Inc. This was the first step under the CSX Corporation holding company to combine all railroads into one railroad. Considered as a \\"temporary railroad\\", the Seaboard System quickly began to merge away the smaller railroads that were owned under the Family Lines System entity, as well as to simplify equipment and management alongside the Chessie System railroads (Chesapeake & Ohio, Baltimore & Ohio, Western Maryland). This included the Georgia Railroad and the Clinchfield Railroad (1983), South Carolina Pacific Railway (April 30, 1984), Louisville, Henderson & St. Louis Railway (July 1984), Gainesville Midland (1985), Atlanta & West Point Railroad (June 1986) and the Columbia, Newberry & Laurens (June 1986). The process began its culmination when Seaboard renamed itself CSX Transportation on July 1, 1986. On April 30, 1987, the Baltimore & Ohio railroad was merged away into the Chesapeake & Ohio. Finally, on August 31, 1987, the Chesapeake & Ohio (still under the Chessie System entity for corporate reasons) was merged into CSX Transportation. All the major railroads under CSX Corporation were now one company. (The Western Railway of Alabama would remain an operating subsidiary until December 2002, when it was finally merged into CSX.Surface Transportation Board, CSX Transportation, Inc.--Corporate Family Merger Exemption--The Western Railway of Alabama, December 26, 2002) The Family Lines logo included the seven systems that were grouped under the name. Equipment colors and painting Even before the creation of the Seaboard System, locomotives began to receive a simplified paint scheme of the Family Lines. However, only the iron-grey, red, and yellow colors were recycled, in combination with a completely redesigned logo featuring a coupled variation font of ITC Eras Demi. The first locomotive to be decorated with the new Seaboard System paint scheme was Uceta GP16 #4802 in October 1982. Because the merger did not occur until December, locomotives after October 1982 were to receive the Seaboard System paint scheme with the existing railroad's reporting marks applied.Moody's Transportation Manual, 1992, pp. xxii-xxiv, 421-428, 451 When the merger officially took effect on January 1, 1983, all former reporting marks were to be either removed or patched with SBD initials. Shortly before taking delivery of the L&N; specified EMD SD50's, Seaboard adopted a Swis721 type font for reporting marks and numbers, instead of the customized Seaboard Coast Line lettering seen on pre-1983 repaints. To simplify its locomotive roster and meet Chessie System specifications, Seaboard introduced a numbering system that partially became meshed within the Chessie System locomotive fleet, and removed any existing Mars Lights or Gyralights from locomotives. Any new locomotives purchased by Seaboard would be built to meet Chessie specifications; of which only three, EMD SD50, EMD MP15T and GE B36-7, were ordered.

It was declared a regional park in 2003. The area of the caldera consists of 24 craters and volcanic edifices; most of them lie under water. Hydrothermal activity can be observed at Lucrino, Agnano and the town of Pozzuoli. There are also effusive gaseous manifestations in the Solfatara crater, the mythological home of the Roman god of fire, Vulcan. This area is monitored by the Vesuvius Observatory. The area also features bradyseismic phenomena, which are most evident at the Macellum of Pozzuoli (misidentified as a temple of Serapis): bands of boreholes left by marine molluscs on marble columns show that the level of the site in relation to sea level has varied.  Geological phases  Three geological phases or periods are recognised and distinguished. * The First Phlegraean Period. It is thought that the eruption of the Archiflegreo volcano occurred about 39,280 ¬± 110 years (older estimate ~37,000 years) ago, erupting about of magma ( bulk volume) to produce the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption. Its Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) was 7. \\"The dating of the Campanian Ignimbrite Eruption (CI) to ~37,000 calendar years B.P. draws attention to the coincidence of this volcanic catastrophe and the suite of , Late Pleistocene biocultural changes that occurred within and outside the Mediterranean region. These included the Middle to Upper Paleolithic cultural transition and the replacement of Neanderthal populations by anatomically modern Homo sapiens, a subject of sustained debate.Neanderthal Apocalypse Documentary film, ZDF Enterprises, 2015. Retrieved 26 January 2016. No less than 150 km3 of magma were extruded in this eruption (the CI eruption), traces of which can be detected in Greenland ice cores. As widespread discontinuities in archaeological sequences are observed at or after this eruption, a significant interference with ongoing human processes in Mediterranean Europe is hypothesized.\\" It is possible that these eruptions drove Neanderthals to extinction and cleared the way for modern humans to thrive in Europe and Asia. The area is characterised by banks of and pipernoid grey tuff at Camaldoli hill, as in the northern and western ridge of Mount Cumae; other referable deep products are those found at Monte di Procida, recognizable in the cliffs of its coast. * The Second Phlegraean Period, between 35,000‚Äì10,500 years ago. This is characterized by the Neapolitan yellow tuff that is the remains of an immense underwater volcano, with a diameter of ; Pozzuoli is at its center. Approximately 12,000 years ago the last major eruption occurred, forming a smaller caldera inside the main caldera, with its centre where the town of Pozzuoli lies today. * The Third Phlegraean Period, between 8,000 ‚Äì 500 years ago. This is characterized by white pozzolana, the material that forms the majority of volcanos in the Fields. Broadly speaking, it can be said there was an initial activity to the southwest in the zone of Bacoli and Baiae (10,000‚Äì8,000 years ago); an intermediate activity in an area centred between Pozzuoli, Spaccata Mountain and Agnano (8,000‚Äì3,900 years ago); and a more recent activity towards the west, which formed Lake Avernus and Monte Nuovo (New Mountain) (3,800‚Äì500 years ago). * Volcanic deposits indicative of eruption have been dated by argon at 315,000, 205,000, 157,000 and 18,000 years ago. = More recent history = A fumarole at the Phlegraean Fields; painting by Michael Wutky (1780s) The caldera, which now is essentially at ground level, is accessible on foot. It contains many fumaroles, from which steam can be seen issuing, and over 150 pools (at the last count) of boiling mud. Several subsidiary cones and tuff craters lie within the caldera. One of these craters is filled by Lake Avernus. In 1538, an eight-day eruption in the area deposited enough material to create a new hill, Monte Nuovo. It has risen about from ground level since 1970. At present, the Phlegraean Fields area comprises the Naples districts of Agnano and Fuorigrotta, the area of Pozzuoli, Bacoli, Monte di Procida, Quarto, the Phlegrean Islands (Ischia, Procida and Vivara). A 2009 journal article stated that inflation of the caldera centre near Pozzuoli might presage an eruptive event within decades. In 2012 the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program planned to drill below the earth's surface near Pompeii, in order to monitor the massive molten rock chamber below and provide early warning of any eruption. Local scientists are worried that such drilling could itself initiate an eruption or earthquake. In 2010 the Naples city council halted the drilling project. Programme scientists said the drilling was no different from industrial drilling in the area. The newly elected mayor allowed the project to go forward. A Reuters article emphasized that the area could produce a \\"super volcano\\" that might kill millions.Antonio Denti, \\"Super volcano\\", global danger, lurks near Pompeii, Reuters, August 3, 2012. A study from the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia shows that the volcanic unrest of the Campi Flegrei caldera from January 2012 to June 2013 was characterised by rapid ground uplift of about , with a peak rate of about per month during December 2012. It adds that from 1985 to 2011 the dynamics of ground uplift were mostly linked to the caldera's hydrothermal system, and that this relation broke down in 2012. The driving mechanism of the ground uplift changed to periodical emplacement of magma within a flat sill-shaped magmatic reservoir about in depth, south from the port of Pozzuoli. In December 2016, activity became so high that an eruption was feared. In May 2017 a new study by UCL and the Vesuvius Observatory and published in Nature Communications revealed that an eruption might be closer than previously thought. The study found that the geographical unrest since the 1950s has a cumulative effect, causing a build-up of energy in the crust and making the volcano more susceptible to eruption. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/supervolcano-campi-flegrei-stirs- under-naples-italy/ https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/supervolcano-naples-italy- eruption-dormant-reawaken- geologists-a7488806.htmlhttp://www.iflscience.com/environment/italian- supervolcano-is-far-closer-to-erupting-than-previously-thought/ On 21 August 2017 there was a magnitude 4 earthquake on the western edge of the Campi Flegrei area. Two people were killed and many more people injured in Casamicciola on the northern coast of the island of Ischia, which is south of the epicentre. A February 2020 status report indicated that inflation around Pozzuoli continues at steady rates with a maximum average of 0.7 cm per month since July 2017. Gas emissions and fumarole temperatures did not change significantly. On Sunday April 26th, 2020, a moderate earthquake swarm hit Campi Flegrei caldera, which included about 34 earthquakes ranging between magnitude 0 and magnitude 3.1 with the swarm centered around the port city of Pozzuoli. The strongest quake in the Earthquake sequence was a magnitude 3.1, which is the strongest earthquake in the caldera going back to least 2011. However, no new fumaroles were reported. Wine Italian wine, both red and white, under the Campi Flegrei DOC appellation comes from this area. Grapes destined for DOC production must be harvested up to a maximum yield of 12 tonnes/hectare for red grape varieties, and 13 tonnes/ha for white grape varieties. The finished wines need to be fermented to a minimum alcohol level of 11.5% for reds and 10.5% for whites. While most Campi Flegrei wines are blends, varietal wines can be made from individual varieties, provided the variety used comprises at least 90% of the blend and the wine is fermented to at least 12% alcohol for reds and 11% for whites.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 132 Firefly Books 2004 Red Campi Flegrei is a blend of 50‚Äì70% Piedirosso, 10‚Äì30% Aglianico and/or Sciascinoso and up to 10% of other local (both red and white) grape varieties. The whites are composed of 50‚Äì70% Falanghina, 10‚Äì30% Biancolella and/or Coda di Volpe, with up to 30% of other local white grape varieties. Cultural importance Campi Flegrei has had strategic and cultural importance. *The area was known to the ancient Greeks, who had a colony nearby at Cumae, the seat of the Cumaean Sibyl. *The beach of Miliscola, in Bacoli, was the Roman military academy headquarters. *Lake Avernus was believed to be the entrance to the underworld, and is portrayed as such in the Aeneid of Virgil.

The research is predominantly done in the United States, Germany and Italy. Theoretically, it includes not only local disasters, but catastrophes on a grand scale. The field is closely linked with environmental sociology and sociocultural anthropology.  Overview  Many studies in the field of sociology of disaster focus on the link between social solidarity and the vulnerabilities exposed by disasters. Scholarship in this field has observed how such events can produce both social solidarityBarton AH. 1969. Communities in Disaster: A Sociological Analysis of Collective Stress.

Washington, DC: USGPO and more importantly, expose inequalities inherent in the social order by exponentially exacerbating its effects. Early disaster research established the mainstream parameters of what it is to do such research - i.e. a focus on solidarity arising in the aftermath of disasters and that disasters are a consequence of human maladaptation to the hazardous environment.  Types and causes of disasters  *Natural disaster ‚Äì a natural disaster is an event that occurs on its own due to the earth's regular processes. Some natural disasters can be predicted while others happen very suddenly. Injury, death and damage to personal or commercial property often occurs during these events. A few examples are tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Certain areas around the globe are prone to certain natural disasters. *Human-made/technological disaster ‚Äì these types of disaster are caused by the human race but can also be prevented by the human race. Advancements in technology are a wonderful thing but some uses of it can be very hazardous to life on earth. Extreme precautions must be taken in order to avoid most of these types of disasters. A few examples are chemical/nuclear, mass power outages and cyber attacks such as computer hacking. *Terrorist attacks ‚Äì a terrorist attack is an act of crime or violence that is directed towards a certain group or belief system. These attacks are usually provoked by political or religious reasons. These events usually include the use of violence that often occur in bodily injury and even loss of life. Some examples are 9/11, Boston marathon bomber and the beheading of multiple American reporters by ISIS *Epidemic - an epidemic is an infectious disease that could be spread world wide. These can occur and could be called a major disaster due to the fact of people getting infected or sick and the amount of deaths that occur before any vaccination has been made. A few examples of major epidemic disasters are Ebola, The Black Death and Asian Flu. All of these had major death tolls and high amounts of people who were infected. Natural disasters and terrorist attacks are the most common occurring types of disasters that affect the human population not only physically but mentally also. These types of disasters are the most detrimental to the morality of society and inflict a lot of mental stress and fear. People affected often have horrific flashbacks and can lead to self-harm and suicide is even possible. With epidemics, it is common for the ones who are affected by it to become very distanced if the disease doesn't make you bed ridden.  Behavior before, during, and after disasters  In the sociology of disaster, human beings are naturally inclined to prepare for the odd event of disaster by buying supplies such as non-perishable foods, bottled water, basic medical supplies, sources of light and heat and batteries to operate such things. We stow these things away in an accessible place but we also have predetermined evacuation routes and ways of transportation to escape the area that will be affected in the coming hours or days if a reliable prediction of catastrophe is presented to us. During the event of disaster, humans usually panic and become stressed out. This is predictable because many have seen the destruction that certain natural disasters can do. People often contact loved ones and try to seek shelter if they cannot avoid the upcoming disaster. Sometimes, nearby societies will prepare and gather supplies to help the people that are being affected by the disaster. Some organizations will try to help the best they can during the disaster and get people out of harm's way. After disaster strikes people tend to act in many different ways. The community as a whole tries to help the affected victims but sometimes a few people can act out of the norm and act in criminal ways. Looting and shootings are often associated with disasters. Many organizations band together and provide relief. Communities eventually learn to adapt to the situation at hand and eventually start to thrive again. After a disaster, a person can change for the better or for the worse. For the better, a person can be a better prep-per for what is to come. For the worse, a person can deal with what happened very differently. After a natural disaster, a person who went through many different scary and unsafe scenarios could deal with PTSD after. PTSD or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder means difficulty recovering after witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event. Having this while trying to deal with the aftermath of a disaster could make things so much harder for the one dealing with it. This could lead to people prepping for the next disaster in different ways. For example, buying non-perishables, medical supplies, clothes, or even preparing their house. Positives of disasters :When populations experience different types of disasters it promotes social change and the coming together of communities in order to help one another. Once a community experiences a disaster they are able to learn and be prepared for the next possible disaster that could happen to them. With an epidemic, a positive of there being one is that when there is a cure found. When people will donate money for getting rid of a disease, everyone who helped with that could gain a sense of pride and accomplishment because they helped find a cure for everyone who was struggling with that disease. We will have it to where if anyone gets infected by that disease again, they won‚Äôt have to worry anymore. =Conflict Theory= :The best scope to look at disaster's effect on society is through conflict theory. A conflict theorist believes that conflict is meant to happen in order to better society and help people to grow through competition and the inequalities between different people and groups. =Socioeconomic status and disaster= :Responding to an areas disaster can depend on many factors including the economic state of that area. Whether or not an area of people is well-off or poor tends to determine how fast they are re-developed and helped after a disaster. Socioeconomic status refers to an individual's position in a stratified social order. This system puts people into groups based on their income and wealth. Those groups consist of Upper Class, Middle Class/ Working Class, and the Lower class/ The Poor. When either of these classes experiences a social disaster there are differences in how well and fast they are helped. If a wealthy community experiences a disaster such as a flood they will most likely receive special treatment due to the way American society treats their poor communities as compared to their wealthy ones. =Location= Urban Cities :Urban areas are especially at risk when it comes to disaster affecting them because of how they are viewed and taken care of by different groups. They also can be seen as more vulnerable due to there being a vast number of people in close proximity. This could also mean that with there being such a big number of people in urban cities. The more likely the community is prepared. One of the biggest disasters to hit an Urban city was the attack on the World Trade Center, or 9/11. Another reason why Urban cities are such a big target is due to the fact that if there is a big city, there is usually something important there. Maybe a government building or a successful business.  Less-Developed Countries  Less-developed countries are more at risk for epidemics. These countries do not always have the right medicine or sanitation for keeping themselves healthy. This makes them more susceptible for getting sick. This can also mean that if these lesser developed countries do acquire an epidemic, it could possibly mean that this sickness could spread to the countries surrounding it, due to not having the necessary materials, or not having the necessary education on what to do when an epidemic presents itself. With Ebola, which started in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a lesser developed country, it spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and other surrounding countries where it spread due to the lack of knowledge on what to do and right materials to help treat it. Having lack of resources could mean multiple different things. Another example for it could be if a bad natural disaster happened in a lesser-developed country and the government couldn't provide the right amount of aid or money for the people who were affected by said disaster.  Coastal Cities  Coastal cities, being close to the ocean, are more susceptible to endure hurricanes or hurricane-like weather. Yes, other states close to these coastal ones will be affected by some coastal disasters, but the right next to the oceans will be affected the most. For example, in 2006, Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana. This was one of the most devastating natural disasters that has ever hit the United States. Another issue for coastal cities is the constant threat of erosion and the rise of sea level. This will always be a threat to people who live next to a body of water. They could always be on a constant level of anxiety for the fact that it could get so bad they will have to move or it could ruin the place they live.

Its passenger operations were taken over by Amtrak in 1971. Eventually, the railroad was merged with its affiliate lines to create the Seaboard System in 1983. At the end of 1970, SCL operated 9,230 miles of railroad, not including A&WP- Clinchfield-CN;&L-GM-Georgia-L;&N-Carrollton; that year it reported 31,293 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 512 million passenger-miles. History CSX's A and S lines The Seaboard Coast Line emerged on July 1, 1967, following the merger of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The combined system totaled , the eighth largest in the United States at the time.Transport Statistics shows 9306 route-miles operated by SCL itself at the end of 1967, not including numerous subsidiaries. The railroad had $1.2 billion in assets and revenue with a 54% market share of rail service in the Southeast, facing competition primarily from the Southern. The seemingly redundant name resulted from the longstanding short-form names of these two major Southeastern railroads. For years, SAL had been popularly known as \\"Seaboard,\\" while ACL was known as \\"the Coast Line.\\" Prior to the creation of Amtrak on May 1, 1971, the Seaboard Coast Line provided passenger service over much of its system, including local passenger trains on some lines.Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Passenger Schedules, July 1, 1967. Local trains ended when the Amtrak era began. Although several named passenger trains survived through the Amtrak era, many were renamed or combined with other services. The first expansion for the Seaboard Coast Line came in 1969 with the acquisition of the Piedmont and Northern Railway, which operated about in North and South Carolina. SCL would buy out the remaining shares and gain control of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in 1971, and the Durham and Southern Railway. On November 1, 1980, CSX Corporation was created as a holding company for the Family Lines and Chessie System Railroad. In 1983 CSX combined the Family Lines System units as the Seaboard System Railroad and later became CSX Transportation when the former Chessie units merged with the Seaboard in December 1986. Effective January 1, 1983, the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad became Seaboard System Railroad after a merger with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and Clinchfield Railroad. For some years prior to this, the SCL and L&N; had been under the common ownership of a holding company, Seaboard Coast Line Industries (SCLI), the company's railroad subsidiaries being collectively known as the Family Lines System which consisted of the L&N;, SCL, Clinchfield and West Point Routes. During this time, the railroads adopted the same paint schemes but continued to operate as separate railroads. Notable SCL services =Juice Train= Juice Train is the popular name for famous unit trains of Tropicana fresh orange juice operated by railroads in the United States. On June 7, 1970, beginning on Seaboard Coast Line railroad, a mile-long Tropicana Juice Train began carrying one million gallons of juice with one weekly round-trip from Bradenton, Florida to Kearny, New Jersey, in the New York City area. The trip spanned one way, and the 60 car train was the equivalent of 250 trucks. Today operated by SCL successor CSX Transportation, CSX Juice Trains have been the focus of efficiency studies and awards as examples of how modern rail transportation can compete successfully against trucking and other modes to carry perishable products. Motive power Immediately following the 1967 merger, the newly created SCL network had 1,232 locomotives. The vast majority of the ACL roster contained EMD locomotives, while the SAL rostered Baldwin and ALCO diesels in addition to EMD models. Both railroads had purchased new freight locomotives in the 5 years leading up to the merger. Among the first new locomotives purchased by the Seaboard Coast Line were 28 GE U33B locomotives, acquired in 1967 and 1968. These were followed by 108 GE U36B locomotives between 1970 and 1972. From EMD, SCL purchased SD45 locomotives in 1968, with more to follow in 1971. SD45-2 locomotives were added in 1974. GP40 and GP40-2 locomotives were added to the fleet between 1968 and 1972 for use on through freights and other high priority freight trains. All former SAL locomotives ran for many years in the \\"Split-image\\" scheme, still in full SAL paint, but relettered and renumbered SCL. Two GP-7's 915 & 981 went from pure SAL to SCL Black without being in split-image and GP-7 944 and RS-3 1156 were never painted black, and retained their SAL paint until retired in 1976. The last operating SCL locomotive in SAL paint was GP-40 1559, former SAL 644, and was repainted at Hamlet, NC in March 1976 according to records. There were former P&N; locomotives that retained their P&N; scheme from 1969 until 1977, only RS-3's 1250 & 1256 and S-4 230 ever were repainted SCL black. Gainesville Midland SD-40, retained its SAL paint until 1986 when it was repainted Seaboard System 8300, it had been SBD 0010 and 8300 in SAL style \\"split-image\\" for several years prior to that. SCL supplemented its local freight units with orders of GE U18B and EMD GP38-2 locomotives. Some U18B models contained a shorter, and therefore lighter, fuel tank which proved ideal for light density lines. Most units of this type were assigned to the Carolinas. However, in 1978 the SCL decided not to purchase any more locomotives for local service on secondary mainlines and branchlines, instead aging GP7, GP9, and GP18 locomotives would be rebuilt into GP16 models at the Uceta shops. In the years leading up to the creation of the Seaboard System in 1983, SCL began acquiring the next generation of locomotives from EMD and GE. These orders included GE B23-7 locomotives in 1978 and 1980, including the GE BQ23-7 variant, of which only 10 were built and all belonged to SCL. EMD GP38-2 units were added in 1979 and 1980, and 5 EMD GP40-2 locomotives also delivered in 1980. Six axle GE C30-7 and EMD SD40-2 units were added to the roster between 1979 and 1980.

It was written and directed by Hideo Kojima, and originally released for the PC-9821 in 1994. A hard science fiction story, Policenauts is set in the mid 21st century and follows Jonathan Ingram, an astronaut recently recovered floating in space in cryosleep after an accident at a space colony sent him drifting into space 24 years ago. Now a detective in Los Angeles, Ingram travels back to the colony to investigate the murder of his ex-wife and her husband's disappearance. As he begins his investigation, he starts to uncover an illegal organ trafficking ring. Kojima conceived Policenauts while working on Snatcher (1988), and started development in 1990. He wanted the production quality to match that of major motion pictures, and created a scripting engine to give him more creative control. He pulled creative influences from American buddy television shows, contemporary social debates on Japan bashing and organ trafficking, and Japan's heightened interest in space travel following the first Japanese man's trip to space in 1990. He wanted to explore the concept of how living in space may affect human society and life, socially and physiologically. The original PC-9821 release used pixel art while wider re-releases on the 3DO, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn featured cel animation by Anime International Company. An English localization was planned for the Saturn, but canceled with Kojima citing technical problems with the translation. After interest in Kojima's work grew with the release of Metal Gear Solid (1998), demand for a translation built until a fan translation was released in 2009. Critics have praised the game's animation, voice acting, and overall presentation. Some called it a blend of cinematic influences pulling from science fiction, action, comedy, and buddy film genres. Many also picked up on Kojima's fascination with science and technology, and praised the technical writing for building an engrossing world and story. Along with Snatcher before it, Policenauts has been called one of the best science fiction works in games and a foundation for Kojima's later work. Gameplay Dialogue options during a conversation (PC-98) Policenauts is a graphic adventure game with a point-and- click interface. It has also been called a visual novel and an interactive movie. The player moves a cursor freely across the screen to click on objects to examine them. During conversations, the player is given dialogue options to choose from. Once the right object in the scene has been examined or the dialogue options have been exhausted, the game progresses to the next scene in the story. In versions with cel animation, these scenes the player must examine are stills from the animated cinematics, so the game moves seamlessly between them and cutscenes. There are occasional action scenes where the player must fire a gun at enemies in a first-person perspective. The Sega Saturn version supports a light gun for these segments. Plot The game centers on Jonathan Ingram, one of the five \\"Policenauts\\", astronauts with police training, assigned to ensure the safety of Beyond Coast, mankind's first fully functional space colony in the year 2013. Jonathan tests a new space walking suit, but drifts away into space by accident and is presumed dead by his colleagues. He is found alive and well 25 years later thanks to the cold-sleep module connected to the suit. The year is now 2040, and Jonathan (now a private investigator working in Old Los Angeles) is visited by his former wife, Lorraine, who asks for Jonathan's help in solving the disappearance of her husband, Kenzo Hojo. Lorraine tells him that the only clues he left behind being a torn leaf, a set of capsules, and the word \\"Plato\\". Jonathan is reluctant to take her case at first, but after Lorraine leaves his office, she is attacked and murdered by a man in a black motorcycle suit. Jonathan, unable to catch the culprit, decides to fulfill his ex-wife's final request and travels to Beyond, where he is reunited with his former partner from his LAPD and Policenaut days, Ed Brown. Ed then introduces Jonathan to two of his underlings, Meryl Silverburgh and Dave Forrest, and all three agree to help Jonathan investigate the circumstances surrounding Hojo's disappearance and Lorraine's murder. Ed then reunites Jonathan with another former Policenaut, Gates Becker, who is now the chief of the Beyond Coast Police Department (BCP). Gates also agrees to help Jonathan in solving his case. To begin their investigation, Jonathan and Ed travel to Hojo's house to meet Karen Hojo, who is the daughter of Hojo and Lorraine, and a news reporter for Beyond Coast Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Though reluctant at first, she agrees to talk with Jonathan about her father's disappearance. Karen tells them that her father was incredibly stressed out regarding his job. She also reveals to Jonathan and Ed that she is suffering from a bone marrow cancer called aplastic anemia, and that her father was able to improve her spot on the priority list so she can receive a treatment. While investigating Hojo's private study, they discover that Hojo had made a spare ID card, and while investigating his Compact Disc collection, Jonathan and Ed discover a CD in a blank case with the Hojo family crest on it containing nothing but sound. After coming up short, Jonathan and Ed then travel to Tokugawa Pharmecuticals, and investigate Hojo's office for clues. They discover that on Hojo's whiteboard that he was supposed to deliver 100 sets of Tokugawa's new drug, K-9, to Beyond Coast Central Hospital (B.C.C.H.) on the day he went missing. The two travel to the hospital and meet Chris Goldwyn, the hospital's director, and Jun Ishida, one of Hojo's co-workers who works in the hospital's pharmacy. Unable to get a strong lead from Ishida and Goldwyn, Jonathan and Ed travel to Tokugawa Headquarters to find a stronger lead. After talking with the receptionist, they learn that Hojo's last known location was at Tokugawa HQ, as he checked into the building on the day he disappeared but never checked out. To learn more, Jonathan and Ed run into former Policenauts Joseph Sadaoki Tokugawa, the head of the Tokugawa group, and Salvatore Toscanini, the head tour guide of Tokugawa's moon plant. After being unable to get any clues from Tokugawa, Jonathan gets into a heated argument with him, suspecting that Tokugawa may have had something to do with Hojo's disappearance. Jonathan is restrained by Ed, who then forces him out of the building to prevent things from escalating into a fight. Later on, while eating dinner at Ed's house, Jonathan and Ed receive a call from an anonymous informant who claims to have information on Tokugawa, and tells them to meet them at the Beyond Space Museum. Upon arriving at the museum, Jonathan and Ed encounter a man in an astronaut costume. They learn that the man in the costume is indeed the informant, and is also using a voice scrambler to keep his identity hidden. The informant tells them that the secret behind the K-9 drug is that it is being used to distribute Narc, a type of illegal drug. He also claims that Hojo has been killed, and is hinting that the one responsible for Lorraine's death works for Tokugawa. He then tells them that Hojo made a presentation for K-9 meant for the mafia that's on a CD. Before he departs, he warns Jonathan and Ed that the organization responsible for Lorraine and Hojo's deaths have infiltrated BCP, and that they should trust nobody. Upon returning to Hojo's house, Jonathan and Ed obtain the blank CD from Hojo's CD collection, and travel back to Tokugawa Pharmecuticals to insert it into a special computer meant only for use by Tokugawa personnel - a TGear-99. Upon returning to Hojo's office, they discover that his whiteboard has been wiped clean, his pictures removed, and his TGear missing. With no other options, the two of them travel to the hospital and run into Chris, and asks her if she has a TGear computer in the hospital. She gives them permission to use the TGear in the pharmacy, and after inserting Hojo's ID and the CD into the terminal, they discover that K-9 is indeed meant to be a vessel for the illegal drug Narc, confirming what their informant had told them. Jonathan and Ed then learn from Meryl that their informant wants to meet them at the museum again. Both men head down to the museum at night, and after breaking in, they discover that their informant had been killed - his head sliced clean off. After investigating further, they discover that the informant was Ishida, and that he was killed because he and Hojo were working together to sell K-9 illegally to the mafia in order to obtain the funds for Karen's treatment. Before returning to their car, they discover the assailant that killed Lorraine. Both men give chase in a major firefight throughout the city, until arriving at a jewelry store, where they discover that Dave had been shot by the assailant. Before dying, Dave tells Jonathan and Ed that the person in the bike suit is a member of BCP's AP division - Tony Redwood. He comes to this conclusion based on the fact that Redwood is a Frozener - an artificial human hatched from eggs that runs on artificial white blood, meant for military and police usage. Dave then dies, and Jonathan and Ed are left with no choice to hunt down Redwood. They chase Redwood into a jewelry store where they discover that he has set a bomb, and if they don't defuse it, it will blow a hole in the colony. They manage to defuse the bomb, but at the cost of losing Redwood. Upon returning to the crime scene where Dave was shot dead, they learn that Dave's body has gone missing. The next day, Jonathan and Ed are chewed out by Gates for their reckless behavior and has decided to hold on to Jonathan's gun until he leaves for home. In order to prove that Tokugawa is running a Narc smuggling ring, Jonathan and Ed sneak into Tokugawa Pharmaceuticals once again for more clues. Upon arriving, Jonathan claims to see one of the security cameras moving, but Ed believes he is hallucinating. Nonetheless, the men take a risk to get into the Restricted section of Tokugawa Pharmaceuticals using Hojo's spare ID card. The card works, and the men enter the area. They then learn that their suspicions have indeed been proven correct. Tokugawa has been secretly growing black poppies, the plant needed to make Narc, in the restricted area of the Pharmaceuticals building. Jonathan also learns that the leaf he received from Lorraine came from a black poppy plant in the restricted area. They then move into the processing area, where the K-9 drug is being produced, and they grab a few sample pills as evidence. Upon arriving back at BCP, they show the pills to Gates, who orders a raid on Tokugawa Pharmaceuticals. However, it doesn't go as planned. Jonathan discovers that the poppies have been switched out, along with the pills they collected last night. Then, BCP, along with an AP squad lead by President Tokugawa himself, unveil Hojo's dead body, all shot up. They conclude that the bullets used to shoot Hojo came from Jonathan's Beretta handgun. Jonathan then learns that he has been set up by both Gates and Tokugawa, and is then framed for the murder of Lorraine, Hojo, and Ishida. Ed is restrained, and Jonathan is knocked out by AP officers. A few days later, Jonathan awakens in Hojo's house, with Karen by his side. Karen tells him than she, the BBC news agency, and Ed, worked together to free Jonathan from BCP's custody. Jonathan then reveals the truth about his relationship with Lorraine to Karen - he tells her that Karen's mother had been against him being a cop, that she almost committed suicide twice, and after being accepted to join the Policenauts program, Jonathan and Lorraine then separated. Karen thanks Jonathan for telling her the truth, and is willing to assist him in his quest to bring down Tokugawa. Jonathan then learns in a phone call from Ed that Tokugawa has almost completely colonized BCP, as they control the AP outfit outright, and that Gates and Tokugawa are working together to keep the Narc smuggling ring a secret. Jonathan and Karen then meet up with Ed at the hospital's morgue at night, and discover that BCP's mortician, Victor, has been killed and placed in a capsule meant for warehouse #7 at Tokugawa's moon plant. They also discover capsules containing Ishida's heart and one of Dave's kidneys, also with labels on them for warehouse #7. Jonathan and Ed send Karen home and assign Meryl to protect her while they travel to the Moon to investigate further. Upon arriving at warehouse #7, they discover that Tokugawa has been running an illegal organ trafficking ring in order to counteract the negative side-effects of being in space for long periods of time. They manage to find both Hojo and Dave's bodies, as well as numerous other bodies, some being women and children. They record the evidence on camera, but before leaving the warehouse, they are then confronted by Salvatore. After confessing more about Tokugawa's scheme, he then reveals to Jonathan that his famous accident in space was in fact no accident, and that Gates and Tokugawa had planned to kill Jonathan by tampering with his EMPS unit. Salvatore then attempts to kill both men, but is then shot and killed by Jonathan. After a lengthy gun battle with Moon Plant security, Jonathan and Ed then escape via a pod on the plant's mass driver. They arrive back on Beyond one week later, where they discover that Ed's adopted son, Marc, has been kidnapped by Tokugawa and are holding him hostage at the museum, which is having a celebratory party for the 30th anniversary of Beyond. Jonathan, Ed, Meryl and Karen make their way to the museum, and upon confronting Marc, who is with a mysterious person in a spacesuit, Ed is then shot by Redwood, and warns Jonathan that he will be next. Karen then collapses from her illness, and both she and Ed are rushed to the hospital. Jonathan then discovers from Karen's doctor that she does not have much longer to live, and that the only thing that can save her is a bone marrow transplant from someone with a matching HLA type. Jonathan learns that the only person with a matching HLA type is Gates. However, the doctor decides to look up Jonathan's HLA type and takes a blood sample from him, but admits that it will take some time. Jonathan is then confronted by Meryl and Marc, and discovers from a picture that Marc drew that the person in the spacesuit who had accompanied Marc after being kidnapped was Chris. After confronting Chris, she reveals that she was forced into working for Tokugawa if she wanted a future on Beyond. She also reveals that she decided to become a Frozener surrogate mother, and that Redwood is her son. Before Jonathan is able to get any more information out of her, Redwood arrives at the hospital and kills Chris, and then prompts Jonathan to come to Tokugawa HQ if he wants to get his hands on Gates' bone marrow. Jonathan decides to go to Tokugawa HQ, and he has Meryl figure out a plan. After taking out most of Tokugawa's guards, Jonathan then heads to the Zero-gravity Garden on the 40th floor to confront Tokugawa and Gates. However, he is then confronted by Redwood, who disables the elevator, and Jonathan is forced to proceed on foot. He then gets into a lengthy gunfight with Redwood, and Jonathan eventually comes out on top. Redwood reveals that he was the one responsible for killing Lorraine, Hojo, Dave, and Ishida, and before Jonathan gets a chance to finally kill him, Redwood then throws himself off the guardrail in the stairway leading up to the 40th floor, killing himself in the process. Jonathan then arrives at the 40th floor, and discovers Gates alone in a prototype EMPS combat unit. Jonathan fails to shoot Gates, as his recoil Beretta has been rendered useless by the Zero-gravity area, and is shot numerous times by Gates, however he hits none of Jonathan's vitals, as he plans to apprehend him and have his organs sold off to the highest bidder. However, Jonathan records Gates' confession about the drug and organ scheme thanks to a camera Meryl gave him, and Meryl then broadcasts Gates' confession to the entirety of Beyond, exposing Tokugawa's scandals to the public. This enrages Gates, who then attempts to kill Jonathan, but he is then shot by Ed, and Gates' EMPS then crashes into a pillar, blowing a hole in Tokugawa HQ. Upon arriving back at the first floor, Jonathan and Ed are then confronted by Tokugawa and his AP unit, who orders them shot dead, however, Meryl arrives with the remaining BCP officers, surrounding and then arresting Tokugawa for his crimes. Afterwards, Jonathan arrives back at BCCH, and the doctor tells him that his HLA type matches that of Karen's, and that he is Karen's actual biological father. Jonathan donates his marrow to Karen, saving his daughter's life. Jonathan then says goodbye to Meryl and Ed, who is now the new chief of BCP, and then departs back to Earth. Development Director Hideo Kojima in 2018 Policenauts was developed by Konami and directed by Hideo Kojima. (Translation ) Kojima began to explore concepts for Policenauts during the development of Snatcher (1988) when memory limitation issues prompted them to take a break. He wanted the game to remain in the adventure genre, feeling it was the best method to express what he wanted with video games. He was also growing frustrated with game development and wanted more creative control. After the release of Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake (1990), he developed a scripting engine so he could maintain control over when animations and music played instead of the programmers. Development on Policenauts began in earnest in 1990 and lasted four years. Kojima wanted to explore a near future scenario that could realistically occur rather than outlandish science fiction. The game's story was influenced by news that captured his interest at the time. One such influence was the public debate over organ transplantation and brain death injuries. Another influence was the rise in Japan bashing caused by the American crime film Rising Sun (1993). Some Asian-Americans held protests, fearing the negative characterization of Japanese in the film would lead to hate crimes. Space travel was also an influence after Toyohiro Akiyama became the first Japanese person to travel to space in 1990. Concurrently, many NASA documents about space travel and its effects on the human body were being published in Japan for the first time and were hot topics among Kojima's friends and family. Kojima was curious as to what effect living in space would have on the human body, relationships, and wondered what facets of humans would be exposed in space. He chose to explore these concepts in Policenauts. Kojima mixed his space interests with the aforementioned social issues to build the thematic basis of Policenauts and hoped the players would ponder these topics. Earth was called \\"Home\\" in the game while the space colony was named \\"Beyond\\", names chosen to reflect a parent-child relationship. \\"Beyond\\" also references the colony's distance from Home and the 25 years protagonist Jonathan Ingram passed through during his cryosleep. Kojima hoped that these names would reflect the persistence of human society and relationships, even after extreme technological advances. The colony's cylindrical shape was inspired by Gundam. Policenauts was originally titled Beyond, but Konami changed the name after they were unable to trademark it. Kojima's familiarity with film and television influenced the cinematography in Policenauts. Though not attempting to use video games as a vehicle for presenting movies, he wanted to fill what he perceived to be a lack of production quality in games. Kojima worked to take the excellence of acting, lighting, direction, and storytelling in filmmaking and match that quality in his games. He took inspiration from American buddy television shows he enjoyed growing up like Starsky & Hutch. The game was originally going to be marketed as a \\"Cinematic Virtual Reality\\". Konami did a trademark search early in development that turned up empty, but by 1994, the \\"Virtual Reality\\" term had been trademarked so it was dropped.  Release  The PC-98 version (top) used animated pixel art while the console versions (bottom) used cel animation Policenauts was first released for the PC-9821 on July 29, 1994. Kojima received a letter from a hearing-impaired player after release, upset that modern games like Policenauts with its CD-ROM technology were replacing game text with actual speech. Kojima originally omitted subtitles to evoke a cinematic feel, but he added them for following versions to satisfy the players. The first port was for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and released on September 29, 1995. A short demo with a game glossary, artwork, and design documents was released on April 21, 1995 called the Pilot Disk. The 3DO version and subsequent console ports had a drop in display resolution, and used newly animated full motion video in contrast to the animated stills used in the PC version. The visuals were animated by Anime International Company using traditional cel animation techniques. The game was ported a second time to the PlayStation, released on January 19, 1996. A bonus disc called Policenauts Private Collection was released concurrently which has most of the same content as the 3DO's Pilot Disk bonuses plus storyboards and the game script, as well as select shooting segments from the main game. The full motion videos in this version run slower at 15 frames per second (FPS) compared to 24 on the 3DO. Some story details that suggested subplots were also removed. The PlayStation launched while Konami was still developing Policenauts for the PC-9821. Seeing the system's potential, Kojima promised himself he would make a Metal Gear game for the system, though first he ported Policenauts. In contrast to computer games, Sony and other console manufacturers ran quality testing on games for their consoles to check for bugs and rate game content. When Policenauts was being evaluated, Shuhei Yoshida of Sony Computer Entertainment told Kojima they were discussing the extent of breast jiggling in the game. This version was re- issued on August 7, 2003 through Konami's online store, and it was re-released digitally on PlayStation Store on May 14, 2008. The final port was for the Sega Saturn, released on September 13, 1996. The version comes packaged in a slipcase containing the game case itself and a hardbound art book. It also includes some additional scenes and some modified story details, including the readdition of removed details in the PlayStation version. Kojima insisted that the Saturn port have increased video fidelity, retaining the 3DO's original 24 FPS and not using Cinepak encoding. The port also includes light gun support, a concept Kojima had since the inception of a Saturn port. His hope was that players would feel more emotion using the gun in Policenauts than in games like Lethal Enforcers (1992) which he felt did not evoke empathy. The Saturn version also has the same glossary featured in the Pilot Disk and Private Collection bonus discs released on previous consoles, accessible at any point in the game, allowing players to lookup keywords whenever they're used in the story. =Localization= An official English translation of Policenauts was announced for release on the Sega Saturn in 1996 in North America. It appeared in catalogs with promotional box artwork, but the game never materialized. Kojima discussed making an English translation three times, but encountered translation difficulties. As he explained, the Japanese dialogue was parsed into phrases with flags the program could reference, and making English dialogue work with this system would be too difficult. Journalist Kurt Kalata called this reason \\"idiosyncratic\\" and possibly false. According to Jeremy Blaustein, who worked in Konami's international business department and led the translations of Snatcher and Metal Gear Solid (1998), there were never plans to localize Policenauts. He personally felt it was one of Kojima's weaker games, not enjoying the \\"space cowboy\\" theme and feeling it lacked the tension and humor of Snatcher. Kalata and 1UP.com believe Konami may have passed on localization because of Snatcher's commercial failure and Policenauts' long scenes and protracted dialogue during an era of heightened consumer interest in 3D action games. After the successful release of Metal Gear Solid, fan interest grew in Snatcher and Policenauts. Around 2000, a petition on the Konami of America online message boards prompted the subsidiary to discuss localizing Policenauts with Konami of Japan. Their attempts were unsuccessful because Kojima did not want to work on older games. In response to the PS One re-release in 2003, fans organized an email campaign to pressure Konami to localize the game once again. Their attempt was publicized and supported by IGN. Work on an English fan translation began in 2002. In February 2007, the team announced it was nearing completion with a planned release for the second half of the year. The translation was finally released two years later in August 2009 as a patch for the PlayStation version. It can be played on an emulator, or a PlayStation modified to read CD-Rs by ripping the game files from retail discs, applying the English patch, and burning the patched game to CD-Rs. Because some fans consider the Sega Saturn version a superior port, fans released a translation patch for it in 2016. Reception In Japan, critics praised Policenauts for its high level of presentation. Both Sega Saturn Magazine and Famitsu praised the quality of animation, voice acting, and its engrossing setting. Sega Saturn Magazine found some of the text difficult to understand and warned that its heavy scientific writing may not be suitable for everyone. They also felt it was more like a movie than a game, and praised its unique blend of buddy films, science-fiction, action, and comedy. Famitsu described the narrative as \\"hardboiled\\". Both publications recommended Policenauts to fans of adventure games and anime. Some Western publications reviewed the game even though it was not released in English. Computer and Video Games previewed the 3DO version and considered it a sequel to Snatcher. They felt the game had an interesting plot, \\"bizarre and inventive\\" characters, and they appreciated the \\"level of senseless violence and gratuitous rudity of graphics.\\" GameFan reviewed the PlayStation and Saturn ports. They felt it pushed the genre of interactive movies better than previous games, particularly those that came from Hollywood when CD-ROMs were new and the genre was making headlines. GameFan also praised the game's intricate detail on medical and technical minutiae, although they cautioned its specificity may put off some players. They also praised the game's suspenseful storytelling, and felt it was worth players' time even though it emphasized text over action. They concluded that Policenauts was \\"a masterful achievement, a near-future scenario so intricately detailed, well thought out and full of originality it puts Hollywood's best attempts at sci-fi to shame.\\" Konami was busy releasing many sports games at the time, so GameFan feared it would not be localized. = Retrospective = Policenauts has continued to receive praise for its writing and presentation in retrospective reviews. Critics highlighted Kojima's obvious cinematic influences from science fiction films, buddy cop films, and other Eastern and Western films. In particular, the character designs drew comparisons to Lethal Weapon (1987). Eurogamer wrote that \\"Kojima's Hollywood fetishism is more rampant in Policenauts than any other title in his oeuvre.\\" IGN called the game a manifest of Kojima's film obsessions, and accomplished in its \\"unique direction and striking moods\\", aided by the well done animation and voice work. 1UP.com felt its production value matched that of anime in the mid 1990s. They liked how the \\"organic\\" animation transitioned seamlessly between cutscene and gameplay. They found this style of presentation better than other games that attempt to flex technical prowess and large budgets with cinematics that don't match the gameplay. Kotaku wrote that \\"Its flashes of Lethal Weapon-esque intrigue give way to the deep metaphysical meanderings that makes for the usual Kojima mind meld on top of fantastic production values and mesmerizing art.\\" Some critics picked up on Kojima's fascination with space and future technology. 1UP.com felt that like other Kojima games, Policenauts was a \\"collage\\" of Kojima's obsessions during that era. For Policenauts, this happened to include space travel in a near-future \\"painted with the brush of Kojima's excited and optimistic imagination.\\" Critics praised the elaborate detail placed into describing hypothetical technologies and commonplace items. Eurogamer called it a fascinating and believable speculation into the future, writing that \\"each and every piece of technology is so thoroughly justified in the descriptions that the world takes on a weighty sense of verisimilitude.\\" Critics felt the game's scientific terminology and dark plot themes were translated well by fans into English. Regarding the game's story, IGN wrote that the \\"somber dialogue\\" progressed it in a unique way. Hardcore Gaming 101 criticized the story for being easy to predict, and described it as \\"empty, merely a buddy cop film with some sci-fi elements. Eurogamer wrote that it may by a detective story on the surface, but felt it was a game about middle age at a deeper level. They found it fascinating how the game followed middle-aged characters as opposed to adolescents in most other games. IGN also praised the game's strong characterization. The game did receive some criticism. Some felt its sexism conflicted with its otherwise more serious tone. 1UP.com explained that this was a mark left over from the game's origins on Japanese computers, a market flooded with hentai games when it was first released. The game's slow pacing was also criticized. 1UP.com wrote that the game requires patience, as some scenes linger for too long and subsequently remove tension. Hardcore Gaming 101 criticized the lack of a dialogue skip option, especially since the player sometimes needed to read through the same dialogue multiple times to find the option that progresses the story. Eurogamer wrote that its format is outdated and not for everyone, however still called it \\"a triumph of gentle interactive storytelling\\" and accomplished within context as a science fiction novella from the 1990s. They felt it could be enjoyed by those with interests in \\"thrillers, point and click adventures, science fiction homage and Japanese esoterica\\".  Legacy  Policenauts was not well known in the West until the fan translation was released 2009. Critics have expressed interest in a re- release or sequel. IGN included it among a list of games they want to see receive a high-definition remaster. Kotaku included it on a list of desired sequels, and expressed interest in a proper English port of the original. Writing in 2013, GameSpot wrote that they wanted to see the game re-released for the PlayStation 4, feeling it could be a good mainstream push for visual novels and adventure games. While still working with Konami in 2012, Kojima expressed interest in exploring a follow-up to Policenauts, but felt it was difficult to carry out from a business perspective. 1UP.com has criticized Konami for failing to acknowledge and or pursue localization of Policenauts and other Kojima non-Metal Gear adventures. In retrospect, the game is often called a spiritual successor to Snatcher. Kotaku wrote: \\"Snatcher was a masterpiece. Policenauts took it a step further.\\" Both have been called some of the best science fiction works in games, and are credited for establishing Kojima's style that propelled him to excellence with his later games. Some of the Policenauts staff went on to hold lead development roles on Kojima's later efforts, including the Zone of the Enders and Metal Gear series. The character Meryl Silverburgh and the Tokugawa Corporation in Policenauts were repurposed for the Metal Gear series.
