These constructions belong to preceramic period. The valley is located southeast of the city of Chiclayo. Zana river is currently dry most of the year, but occasionally it has torrential flows. These were small stone-lined canals that drew water from uphill streams in the Andes Mountains region. Archaeologists believe that the canals were used 4,500 years ago and as early as 6,700 years ago. Accelerator Mass Spectrometer dating of aggregate flecks of charcoal from the oldest canal dated to 6705 + 75 14C. The canals were more or less u-shaped, symmetrical and shallow. Stones were found along the sides of the canals which are thought to have been used to protect against erosion. The placement and slope of the canals demonstrates engineering planning. The upkeep for these canals also reveal social organization of labor. Although Tom Dillehay and his team from Vanderbilt University discovered the canals in 1989, the importance of them has been uncovered only in the most recent field study. These canals are confirmed to be around 5,400 years old. They range in size but all are built downwards, relying on gravity to draw water from an upper canal to the lower crops. The construction and maintenance of these canals required a lot of work from the entire community. This allowed for a connection and communication within the community, as the responsibilities were shared amongst everyone. Dillehay states that he does not believe there was a central leader in the building of these canals as it was in the very early stages of the Andean Society. The surrounding areas also show no signs of their being any sort of hierarchy. Dillehay also states that these canals, much like the ones in Pharaonic Egypt or the kingdoms of Mesopotamia, compare to early canals in the Old World in the sense that they rely on gravity to draw water over short distances, where it could be easily managed. In November 2019, Peruvian archaeologists led by Walter Alva discovered a 3,000-year-old, 130 feet long megalithic 'water cult' temple with 21 tombs in the Oyot√∫n district. Archaeologists assumed that the temple was abandoned around 250 BC and later used as a burial ground by the Chumy people. Twenty of the tombs belonged to the people of Chumy, and one to an adult male buried buried during the Formative period with a ceramic bottle with two spouts and a bridge handle. According to the excavations, as many as three construction phases took place in the temple: the first was between 1500 BC-800 BC, when people built the foundations of the building from cone-shaped clay; second, between 800 BC-400 BC, when the megalithic temple was built under the influence of the pre-Inca civilization known as the Chavin; and finally 400 BC-100 BC, when people added circular pillars used to hold the roof of the temple.  Za√±a, Peru  Though the small town of Za√±a might seem like it‚Äôs a deserted ghost town, it actually comes from a time of rich history. Za√±a and the Za√±a Valley have been occupied by humans for thousands years, but the events of tragedy in the Colonial Period are what lead to the current state of this area. Za√±a is located roughly 50 kilometers from the Pacific shore to the west and the Andes Mountains to the east. Because of the location, it was a flourishing community full of Spanish elites. Since there was a lot of work to be done maintaining the canals, the Spanish imported African slaves to increase the pool of labor workers used for the economy. Gold and silver mining were also big sources of income for Za√±a in the 16th and 17th centuries. Za√±a was on its way to become a very important city in Peru, perhaps even the new world. A little over 100 years after the founding of the city, word began to spread of the wealth of Za√±a. In 1686, Edward Davis ‚Äì a pirate ‚Äì led a raid resulting in all possible forms of wealth and trade goods being taken. Many more pirate attacks followed into the 1700s. On the path to recovery, Mother Nature brought torrential rains in the early 1720s that led to the rising of the Za√±a River and eventually the flooding that destroyed the entire city of Za√±a on the 15th of March of the same year! Once the rains stopped, all that was left were the skeletal remains of the churches and convents surrounding it. The Spanish left and never came back, but left the African slaves out on their own. Now many of the residents who live in Za√±a have African heritage and can trace their family line back to the destruction of the city.

It is traditionally consumed as part of the Dragon Boat Festival at the height of summer. Tradition Realgar solution was sprinkled around the house as a repellent against snakes and insects since ancient times. In this sense, realgar was considered to be a universal antidote against poison by traditional Chinese medicine, which therefore advocated its use for protection against disease, snakes, and evil spirits. The Dragon Boat Festival coincides with what Chinese astronomy considers the height of summer and yang's force for the year. Adults were advised to consume huangjiu (as alcohol is considered yin) dosed with realgar powder; children too young to consume alcohol would wear an amulet containing realgar or have a (\\"king\\") drawn on their forehead or chest with realgar slurry left over from the production of the wine to protect them. These practices were later connected with the festivities honoring poet and statesman Qu Yuan (340‚Äì278 BC), who killed himself in protest by drowning in a river.Zhang YN, Sun GX, Williams PN, Huang Q, Zhu YG (2011) Assessment of the solubility and bioaccessibility of arsenic in realgar wine using a simulated gastrointestinal system. Sci Total Environ, volume 409, issue 12, pages 2357-2360. According to legend, locals rushed in boats to save him or preserve his body from being eaten by the fish. A doctor among them is said to have cast realgar into the river, drawing out an aquatic dragon which the boatmen promptly killed. Preparation Realgar wine can be bought ready- made, but it is often prepared from homemade yellow wine and realgar mineral powder bought from drugstores, markets, or street vendors. A typical recipe calls for 50 to 100 grams of realgar powder to be added to one litre of home- made wine and left to stand at room temperature for several hours. Health risks Although practiced for many centuries, the drinking of realgar wine and the painting of children with realgar have come under scrutiny in modern times. Pure realgar by itself has low toxicity when ingested since its poor solubility hampers its absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, but the minerals used in realgar wine may contain substantial amounts of other inorganic arsenic compounds, such as arsenate and arsenite, which can be absorbed by the body. Arsenic is a potent poison and a causal factor in urinary bladder, skin, liver and lung cancers. There have been a number of poisonings associated with realgar ingestion. Samples of realgar wine have been found to contain 70 to 400 mg of dissolved arsenic compounds per litre (compared to less than 0.003 mg/L in the homemade wine itself), mostly as arsenite and arsenate: more than a thousand times the maximum concentration of arsenic legally allowed in commercial liquor. The concentration of dissolved arsenic decreases as ethanol content increases. Consumption of 200 mL of the realgar wine containing 70 mg arsenic compounds per liter resulted in a substantial increase of arsenic levels in urine, to 200 Œºg/L.Zhang YN, Sun GX, Huang Q, Williams PN, Zhu YG (2011) A cultural practice of drinking realgar wine leading to elevated urinary arsenic and its potential health risk.

The program was released in July 2013 for Android operating systems, PC, and Mac computers. The game is very loosely based on NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Gameplay Snowden Run 3D plays as a free-to-play endless runner. Played in a behind the back, third person viewpoint, \\"Snowden\\" automatically runs forward, and the player must direct Snowden through the levels with swiping motions using a touch screen, to avoid obstacles and collect certain items. Specifically, the player is to direct Snowden into USB sticks and laptops in order to collect \\"sensitive information\\", while trying to avoid \\"Agent Jake\\", who chases after Snowden with the intent of imprisoning him. The player at times also has the option to call \\"Uncle Putin\\" on a cell phone, who will drop a hydrogen bomb on the location, which helps clear a path and further the distance between Snowden and Agent Jake. The game contains three different randomly generated levels; NSA Headquarters, Hong Kong and Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport. The levels play out infinitely, with no way to win or finish. Upon inevitably being captured, Snowden is captured and sent to Guantanamo Bay, where the game ends. The game's soundtrack features music from Peruvian born American rapper and social activist Immortal Technique. Development The game was developed by programmer Michele Rocco Smeets, who states that the game took only 30 hours of development time. Smeets had noted how many spinoffs of Temple Run existed on the Google Play and iOS App Store, and was inspired to attempt to create one of his own. In early planning stages, at one point, he imagined the game as being more in the vein of a traditional platformer game, such as Super Mario Bros., but eventually felt that the constant running of an endless runner was more appropriate and symbolic of the nature of Edward Snowden and the NSA. The game was originally intended as a Ludum Dare entry, an accelerated video game development contest. Smeets states that the game is meant to be a neutral and unbiased parody of Edward Snowden's involvement in the Global surveillance disclosures of 2013, and was not made out of any political motivation or affiliation. A version of the game for iOS has been announced, but has not been released or given a release date. Reception Reception for the game was generally mixed. GameZone criticized the game for being difficult and buggy, but overall advocated at least giving the game a try as \\"amusing way to pass time\\", and compared it favorably to Hudson Soft's Adventure Island video game from the 1980s.GameZone Review Kotaku was less enthusiastic, referring to the game as \\"pretty awful\\".

It is the oldest building on the campus, with elements dating back to 1853. At that time Culver-Stockton College was known as Christian University, the first co-educational institution of higher learning west of the Mississippi River. The building was named to honor D. Pat Henderson, one of the college founders. Henderson Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Henderson Hall, pre-1917 when Christian University became Culver‚ÄìStockton College. The original dome in this photo was replaced in 1960. Description Henderson Hall is located atop a bluff approximately one mile from the Mississippi River. The building is a modified \\"T\\" shape 123 feet by 117 feet at its widest and includes a full basement. The Neo-Classical three-story building is constructed of red brick fronted by a large tetrastyle Ionic portico and topped by a large, distinctive dome visible from a considerable distance. The original dome was replaced in 1960, and replaced again in 2003 after a tornado struck the Culver-Stockton campus, damaging Henderson Hall among other buildings. The interior was significantly altered from its original construction during a major renovation in 1967-68, and has very little resemblance to its original look or design. D. Pat. Henderson, for whom the building is named. History On March 23, 1903 the original building on the Christian University (today's Culver‚ÄìStockton) campus, \\"Old Main\\", which predated the American Civil War, was destroyed by fire. Appreciating the importance of the college to the town, citizens rallied to its aid. In addition to opening up local churches and other buildings for use as temporary classrooms Canton residents raised $15,000 in just ten days to help the college rebuild. The college was able to salvage some stone and brick from the Old Main rubble, and using it plus the community's donation, an $8,000 insurance payout, and a $15,000 loan to build the current Henderson Hall. Within a few short months the rubble had been cleared away and construction on the new Henderson Hall began on August 10, 1903. Knowing time was critical to the college and the town, construction workers labored through adverse Missouri winter weather to complete the basic building by the following spring. Even with using salvaged stone and brick from the original, the college still lacked funds to provide for amenities in the Henderson Hall when it was officially occupied on May 15, 1904. Further, the construction loan needed to be repaid so in August 1904 famed orator and political figure William Jennings Bryan spoke in Canton to help raise additional funds. The building at first housed men's and women's gymnasiums, a large assembly hall, dining room and various administrative offices. In 1915 the first of several remodeling projects was undertaken, adding science labs and a library. Further repairs and renovations took place in 1937, 1948, 1960, and 1968, changing both the purpose and interior look of the building. As mentioned earlier, in 2003 a tornado struck the Culver-Stockton campus, destroying the Henderson Hall dome, itself a 1960 replacement for the 1903-4 original. The dome was once again replaced and Henderson Hall continues today to serve as a campus centerpiece, housing primarily administrative offices but also some classroom space.

Retrieved October 19, 2018. is an American editor, anthologist, game designer, book packager, fiction writer, and historian.  Life  Fawcett and fellow science fiction writer Jody Lynn Nye were married in 1987. They met at a science fiction convention in 1985. At that time, Fawcett owned a gaming company in Niles, Illinois, and Nye began to work as a freelance writer for the company. Career Bill Fawcett was one of the players in early Dungeons & Dragons games being played in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas, using photocopied prototypes of the rules handed out by Gary Gygax. Darwin Bromley brought Fawcett on as a partner in Mayfair Games soon after the company was formed in 1980, and together they designed the game Empire Builder (1980). As a veteran role-playing gamer, Fawcett decided to get Mayfair into the RPG field, and the company kicked off its Role Aids game line with Beastmaker Mountain (1982). As a result of their connections with Mayfair, FASA was able to get a license to publish adventures (1982‚Äì1984) for Chaosium's Thieves' World role-playing game thanks to Fawcett's friendships with Robert Asprin and Lynn Abbey. Fawcett and Jordan Weisman designed the robot arena fighting game Combots (1983) for FASA. Fawcett produced the Crossroads books (1987‚Äì1988), a set of licensed gamebooks published by Tor. He edited the book The War Years 1: The Far Stars War (1990). With David Drake, he co-edited The Fleet series (1988-1991), as well as its sequels, Battlestation, Book One (1992), and Battlestation, Book Two: Vanguard (1993). As a book packager, Fawcett arranged a deal between Wizards of the Coast and HarperCollins to publish novels set in Magic's multiverse of Dominia; the first of these was Arena (1994). His 2008 book, Oval Office Oddities, was described as \\"Chock-full of information‚Äîtrivia, anecdotes, charts, illustrations, etc.\\" focusing on the lives of American presidents and their wives. Works Fawcett and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro write mystery novels together under the pen name Quinn Fawcett. Fawcett was also a field historian for the Navy SEAL museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, and has co-authored work on the US Navy Seals in Vietnam. =As writer= * Cold Cash Warrior: Combat Command in the World of Robert Asprin's Cold Cash War (with Robert Asprin) (1989) Mistakes in History series * Trust Me, I Know What I'm Doing * 100 Mistakes That Changed History * Men At War * It Seemed Like A Good Idea * How To Lose A War At Sea * Doomed To Repeat * How To Lose WWII * How To Lose The Civil War * Hunters And Shooters * How To Lose A War * It Looked Good On Paper * Oval Office Oddities: An Irreverent Collection of Presidential Facts, Follies and Foibles * You Said What? * How To Lose A Battle * You Did What?

In one of five investigations reviewed by SOCA, 102 organisations and individuals involved were identified. The investigators specialised in illegally obtaining private data from banks, utility companies and HM Revenue and Customs. The list of 102 names has been given to the Home Affairs Select Committee that is investigating private investigators. SOCA is refusing to allow the select committee to publish the names on the list, and together with the Metropolitan Police, has stressed that none of the names are believed to have acted illegally. Firms involved 102 companies in 22 different sectors were named on the list given by SOCA to the Home Affairs Select Committee. Many of the names on the list were uncovered as a result of Operation Millipede, a SOCA investigation into blagging and hacking. SOCA is preventing the committee from naming the individual companies, but has allowed the naming of some of the sectors that the companies are in. These include: * Accountancy firms * Auditors * Food service companies * Car rental agencies * Construction companies * Financial services companies * Insurance companies * Insurance businesses * Law firms * Management consultancies * Oil companies * Rail firms * Venture capitalists The individual companies have not been told by SOCA that they have been identified. Two celebrities have been identified in addition to the companies above. On 10 September 2013, it was reported in the Daily Mail that one of the named celebrities was Simon Cowell. The largest sector identified are law firms, twenty two appear on the list. SOCA and the Metropolitan Police are not alleging that the individuals or companies on the list have or may have committed criminal offences. In addition, the Metropolitan Police is checking the list against its own current investigation, they will inform the select committee when their investigation is complete. There is an additional list of 200 names held by the Metropolitan Police. Graham Freeman, a hacker who was jailed as a result of SOCA's Operation Milipede said that 80 per cent of his clients were blue-chip companies and high-profile individuals, with the rest connected to the media. Freeman said that SOCA's list was a \\"Pandoras box\\", which could lead to the imprisonment of dozens of bankers, lawyers and boardroom executives. Home Affairs Select Committee Members of Parliament on the Home Affairs Select Committee, under chairman Keith Vaz, are examining claims that the companies used private investigators to engage in industrial espionage. The list given to the committee by SOCA has been marked as confidential, SOCA have demanded the list be ‚Äòkept in a safe in a locked room, within a secure building and that the document should not be left unattended on a desk at any time'. SOCA has refused to allow the MPs to release the list. Trevor Pearce, the director- general of SOCA, met Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, in Parliament and asked him not to publish the information as the material would be handed to the Information Commissioner to pursue in civil actions. A decision on whether to release the names will be taken when the committee publishes its report into private investigators. Vaz said that \\"the list has been around for a number of years and nobody has done anything about it...It is in the public interest for the information to be available at the appropriate time, not for this saga to drag on.‚Äú Following the resignation of Ian Andrews, the head of SOCA, Vaz said that he would write to Andrews's successor to ask if they would review the decision not to release the list. Four other historic police inquiries included in the SOCA file have not been passed to the MPs on the committee. A fellow committee member, James Clappison, wrote to the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Bernard Hogan-Howe, to ask him for names of the companies and individuals who had hired corrupt private investigators. Clappison wrote there was ‚Äú...a public interest in knowing as much about the circumstances of these operations as can be properly disclosed‚Äù. A Metropolitan Police investigation from 2007, Operation Barbatus, was later included in the suppressed SOCA report. Barbatus had found that private investigators were hacking computers and corrupting police officers, two detectives had been jailed after they tried to access the New York Stock Exchange unlawfully. The select committee has been given a breakdown of companies by sector on the list. The companies include 21 law firms, nine companies in the insurance sector, four food service companies, an oil firm and a pharmaceutical company. Vaz later wrote to the heads of various British regulatory bodies to ask for clarification over their guidelines on the usage of private investigators. Vaz said that ‚ÄúThe context in which the companies implicated by Soca‚Äôs information have acted is crucial for us to understand their motives.‚Äù The bodies contacted included the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, the Law Society, the Office of Fair Trading, the Office of Rail Regulation and the Financial Conduct Authority. SOCA refuses to name the clients involved in Operation Millipede as it believes it could disrupt the ongoing Operation Tuleta, an operation into computer hacking and criminal activity by the Metropolitan Police. Tuleta will conclude at the end of 2015 and SOCA asked the committee to suppress the names until they have been addressed by the Information Commissioner at the end of Tuleta. Five companies on the list are being investigated by detectives working on Operation Tuleta. SOCA said that there was no proof the clients acted illegally. None of the clients of the company, Active Investigation Services, were successfully prosecuted. The director general of SOCA, Trevor Pearce, and Metropolitan Police Commander Neil Basu issued a joint statement to the Home Affairs Select Committee on 12 July 2013 that claimed SOCA had provided the Metropolitan police with ‚Äúfull access‚Äù to computers seized years earlier from the corrupt private investigators. Vaz later said that it was \\"not the case\\" that the Metropolitan Police had been given full access to all material held by SOCA. Basu wrote to Vaz to tell him that his officers had only recently been given the list 102 blue-chip companies, on 30 July. Ian Andrews The chairman of SOCA, Ian Andrews, resigned in August 2013, following his failure to declare his ownership of Abis Partnership Ltd, a management consultancy company that he owned with his wife, Moira. His wife is additionally the head lawyer of a consultancy firm, Good Governance Group (G3). Andrews did not believe that failing to declare his wife's job at G3 was a conflict of interest, but said that his decision not to disclose his own interest in his own company was \\"inexcusable\\". Andrews had earlier referred himself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) after he was accused of misleading Parliament. Andrews had been confronted by a former British Army intelligence officer, Ian Hurst, who was \\"enraged\\" after Andrews told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee that he was ‚Äúabsolutely satisfied‚Äù that SOCA had not previously provided false testimony to the committee. Hurst was hacked by private investigators identified by SOCA in 2006 but was only informed in 2011. Hurst's computer had been unlawfully accessed by corrupt private investigators and he emailed Andrews to tell him that he was ‚Äúfrankly astonished‚Äù at his evidence. SOCA did not respond to Hurst but the IPCC later contacted him to tell him that SOCA had referred the case to them. IPCC later had to send Hurst's complaint back to SOCA as they had ‚Äúno jurisdiction‚Äù over Andrews's actions.

The division was formed in January 2014 during the corporate restructuring of European Aeronautic Defence and Space (EADS), and comprises the former Airbus Military, Astrium, and Cassidian divisions. It is the world's second largest space company after Boeing and one of the top ten defence companies in the world. Airbus Defence and Space has its corporate headquarters in Ottobrunn, Germany, and is led by Dirk Hoke, the Chief Executive Officer. The company has four programme lines: Military Aircraft (led by Alberto Guti√©rrez), Space Systems (led by Jean-Marc Nasr), Communication-Intelligence-Security (led by Evert Dudok) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (led by Jana Rosenmann). With its presence in 35 countries, the company employs 40,000 people from 86 nationalities and contributes to 21% of Airbus revenues. In 2017 Airbus ranked 94th on the Fortune Global 500 list, and was one of the \\"World's Most Admired Companies\\".  History  = Formation of EADS and expansion (1997‚Äì2008) = As early as 1995 the German aerospace and defence company DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) and its British counterpart British Aerospace were said to be eager to create a transnational aerospace and defence company. The two companies envisaged including the French company A√©rospatiale, the other major European aerospace company, but only after its privatisation. The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of British Aerospace, DASA, A√©rospatiale and Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA into an integrated company. However, the merger faltered, and British Aerospace abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival, Marconi Electronic Systems, the electronics division of General Electric Company. The merger of British Aerospace and MES to form BAE Systems was announced on 19 January 1999 and completed on 30 November.BAE Systems Annual Report 1999 22. BAE Systems plc (2000). Retrieved on 2006-10-27. DASA and the Spanish aircraft company Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA agreed to merge on 11 June 1999. On 14 October 1999 DASA agreed to merge with A√©rospatiale-Matra to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company. 10 July 2000 was \\"Day One\\" for the new company which became the world's second-largest aerospace company after Boeing and the second-largest European arms manufacturer after BAE Systems. In January 2001 Airbus Industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company, with legal and tax procedures being finalised on 11 July. On 16 June 2003 EADS acquired BAE's 25 % share in Astrium, the satellite and space system manufacturer, to become the sole owner. EADS paid ¬£84 million, however due to the lossmaking status of the company BAE invested an equal amount for \\"restructuring\\". It was subsequently renamed EADS Astrium, and had the divisions Astrium Satellites, Astrium Space Transportation and Astrium Services. On 1 July 2003 EADS Defence & Security Systems was founded with the merger of the activities of missile systems (LFK), defence electronics, military aircraft and telecommunications of the EADS Group. Tom Enders became the first CEO of the new division.  Airbus Military  The predecessor company was established in January 1999 as the Airbus Military Company SAS to manage the Airbus A400M project, taking over from the Euroflag consortium. In May 2003, the company was restructured as Airbus Military Sociedad Limitada (AMSL) prior to the execution of the production contract. The Military Transport Aircraft Division (MTAD) was a division of EADS which designs, manufactures and commercialises EADS-CASA light and medium transport aircraft, and headquartered in Madrid, Spain.Being Part of aMuch Bigger World In 1999 was Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA (CASA) in the EADS Group (European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company) incorporated. In Spain it was still referred to as EADS-CASA. The EADS-CASA division Military Transport Aircraft Division (MTA division) was also responsible for the development, production and sales of the leichten- and medium Transport and utility aircraft within the EADS Group. On 16 December 2008, EADS announced that the Military Transport Aircraft Division (MTA division) and Airbus Military SL (AMSL) as a new business unit in the Airbus SAS integrated. Airbus Military was formally created in April 2009 by the integration of the former Military Transport Aircraft Division (MTAD) and Airbus Military Sociedad Limitada (AMSL) into Airbus. The division manufactured tanker, transport and mission aircraft including Airbus A330 MRTT, Airbus A400M, CASA C-212 Aviocar, CASA/IPTN CN-235 and EADS CASA C-295. After the merger, it also acquired the production of Eurofighter Typhoon, which was earlier under Cassidian. Eurocopter, which was earlier under Airbus Military, was reorganized as Airbus Helicopters.  Astrium  Astrium was formed in 2000 by the merger of Matra Marconi Space (itself formed from French and British companies) with the space division of DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG and Computadores Redes e Ingenier√≠a SA. Henceforth Astrium was a joint venture between EADS and BAE Systems. On 16 June 2003 the minority shareholder, BAE Systems, sold its 25% share to EADS, making EADS the sole shareholder. Astrium became EADS Astrium Satellites and in a wider restructuring became the major constituent of EADS Astrium, which also included EADS Astrium Space Transportation and EADS Astrium Services. In this restructuring the former Astrium Space Infrastructure division merged with EADS Launchers & Vehicles division to form EADS SPACE Transportation, which became later EADS Astrium Space Transportation. Also, Paradigm Secure Communications, initially created by Astrium in the frame of the Skynet 5 contract for the UK Ministry of Defence became the major constituent of EADS SPACE Services. CASA Espacio became part of EADS Astrium on 1 January 2004. EADS Astrium was the sole shareholder of Infoterra Ltd. On 1 July 2006, the French subsidiary of EADS Astrium, EADS Astrium SAS, merged with other French subsidiaries of EADS Space (especially EADS Space Transportation).  Cassidian  EADS Defence & Security Systems was founded on 1 July 2003. In it, the activities of missile systems (LFK-Lenkflugk√∂rpersysteme GmbH), defence electronics, military aircraft and telecommunications of the EADS Group were merged. On 17 September 2010 the company name was changed to Cassidian, an amalgamation of the Latin words Cassida (helmet) and meridian, and focused on worldwide protection and security. Cassidian was further subdivided into Missiles (missile systems), Defence Electronics (defence electronics, such as sensors, electronics and mission avionics), Cassidian Air Systems (production and maintenance of military aircraft) Defence & Communication Systems (Defence and Communications Systems) and Services (military service). In 2012 a new division was incorporated as Cassidian CyberSecurity GmbH, headquartered in Ottobrunn. = Post merger (2013‚Äìpresent) = Airbus Defence and Space was formed in 2013 as a result of the merger of Astrium, Cassidian, and the Airbus Military divisions of European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) which was itself reorganized as Airbus. On 1 January 2014, the parent company EADS was restructured as Airbus, comprising three subsidiary companies that include Airbus Defence and Space, Airbus, and Airbus Helicopters. On 16 September 2014, after a detailed and comprehensive portfolio assessment, Airbus Defence and Space defined Space (Launchers & Satellites), Military Aircraft, Missiles and related Systems and Services as its future core businesses. Some business areas were identified as divestment candidates as they did not fit the strategic goals for the company. Under this plan, the commercial and para- public communication business (including Professional Mobile Radio and commercial satellite communications services activities) was divested. Subsidiaries and J.V. including Fairchild Communications, Rostock System- Technik, AVdef, ESG and Atlas Electronik were divested. On 18 March 2016 the company decided to sell its defence electronics business (Defence Electronics) based in Ulm to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a global investment firm with a wide- ranging portfolio including Hospital Corporation of America, NXP Semiconductors, TDC A/S, and Dollar General. From January 1, 2017. the group reorganized under the brand name of \\"Airbus\\". The subsidiaries Airbus, Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space became operating divisions of the same company. Organisation Airbus Defence and Space is structured into four business lines: * Military Aircraft (headed by Alberto Guti√©rrez) is responsible for fighter aircraft, airlifters, aerial refuelling tankers, and airborne warfare systems. ** Global strike ** Mobility ** Surveillance and engagement ** Missiles and unmanned airborne systems * Space Systems (headed by Jean-Marc Nasr) is responsible for Space exploration, missile defence, satellites, other networking services and also the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion MPCV) and Space Station programmes. ** Information solutions ** Strategic missile and defence systems ** Network and tactical systems ** Space and intelligence systems ** Space exploration * Communications, Intelligence and Security (headed by Evert Dudok) is responsible for providing intelligence to various governmental agencies. ** Secure communications solutions for the military, government and institutional players and users ** Airbus Cyber Security ** Airbus DS Communications ‚Äì a North American public safety company *UAS - Unmanned Aerial Systems (headed by Jana Rosenmann)  Aircraft  = Tankers and transport aircraft = * Airbus A330 MRTT Airbus A330 MRTT The Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) is an aerial refuelling tanker aircraft based on the civilian Airbus A330.

Space Systems = Launchers = Ariane 4 Ariane 5 * Ariane is a series of a European civilian expendable launch vehicles for space launch operated from 1973 onwards. It is a collaboration between France, Germany and the UK. The Ariane project was code-named L3S (the French abbreviation for third-generation substitution launcher). The European Space Agency (ESA) charged the EADS subsidiary Astrium, presently Airbus Defence and Space, with the development of all Ariane launchers and of the testing facilities, while Arianespace, a 32.5% CNES commercial subsidiary created in 1980, handles production, operations and marketing. Arianespace launches Ariane rockets from the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou in French Guiana. Ariane 5 completed its 74th consecutive successful mission in October 2016. The newest iteration Ariane 6 is under development with a first test flight scheduled for 2020. = International Space Station = * Automated Transfer Vehicle, originally Ariane Transfer Vehicle or ATV, was an expendable cargo spacecraft developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). ATVs supplied the International Space Station (ISS) with propellant, water, air, payloads, and experiments. ATVs also reboosted the station into a higher orbit. ATV * Columbus is a science laboratory that is part of the International Space Station (ISS) and is the largest single contribution to the ISS made by the European Space Agency (ESA). The functional architecture (including software) of the lab was designed by Airbus Defence and Space in Bremen, Germany where it was also integrated before being flown to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida in an Airbus Beluga. It was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on 7 February 2008 on flight STS-122. Columbus ISS Module = Space transportation = * The Orion service module is the service module component of the Orion spacecraft, serving as its primary power and propulsion component until it is discarded at the end of each mission. In January 2013, NASA announced that the European Space Agency (ESA) will construct the service module for Artemis 1, replacing the previous design. Based on ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), the new design is also known as the European service module (ESM). The service module supports the crew module from launch through separation prior to reentry. It provides in-space propulsion capability for orbital transfer, attitude control, and high altitude ascent aborts. It provides the water and oxygen needed for a habitable environment, generates and stores electrical power, and maintains the temperature of the vehicle's systems and components. This module can also transport unpressurized cargo and scientific payloads. Orion service module = Astronomy and cosmology missions = * Euclid (developed jointly with Thales Alenia Space is a space mission currently under development by the European Space Agency (ESA). The objective of Euclid is to better understand dark energy and dark matter by accurately measuring the acceleration of the universe.

During the battle, the Tang general Chai Shao distracted the Tuyuhun soldiers with an erotic dance performed by two dancing girls. While the nomads watched the dance, Chai Shao attacked from the rear and defeated the Tuyuhun. The Tuyuhun suffered more than five hundred casualties over the course of the battle. Battle Clay figure of a dancing girl from the 8th century from the same era, the Tang Dynasty. The Tuyuhun and Tanguts regularly raided Chinese settlements along the western Tang frontier. In 623, the Tuyuhun departed from their homeland in the pastures surrounding Qinghai Lake, known in Mongolian as Kokonur, and invaded Gansu. The Tang general Chai Shao was dispatched to defeat the nomads and prevent further incursions. The Tuyuhun held the higher ground and shot arrows against the encroaching Tang forces. Chai Shao, in the words of historian Charles Patrick Fitzgerald, \\"was a general of many, if unorthodox, resources.\\" He devised a decoy by sending two dancing girls and a group of musicians to a small hill near the Tuyuhun camp. The musicians played the pipa, a stringed instrument of foreign origin, while the girls positioned themselves on top of a hill. On the hill, the dancing girls performed an erotic dance in front of the nomads. The attention of the Tuyuhun was diverted entirely towards the girls as the soldiers disbanded their military formation and rushed to the hill for a clearer view of the dance. Seizing the opportunity, Chai Shao surprised the soldiers who were distracted by the performance, and attacked them in the rear with his cavalry. Over five hundred Tuyuhun soldiers were killed in the ensuing battle, forcing the Tuyuhun's retreat from Gansu. Fitzgerald ends his description of the Tuyuhun defeat with the moral that \\"it is most unwise, in the midst of battle, to let the mind dwell on the delights of peace.\\" Aftermath Hostilities between the Tuyuhun and Tang continued after the battle. Between 634 and 635, Emperor Taizong conducted a large military expedition against the Tuyuhun led by the general Li Jing. The Tang forces were reinforced with allied Tangut and Turkic soldiers during the invasion. Tuyuhun was defeated, and capitulated to the Tang court as a vassal.

Incumbent Anthony M. Masiello, a Democrat, easily trounced his sole opponent in the primary, going on to win a third term with no serious opposition in the general election. Buffalo's 2001 mayoral election was notable for its uncharacteristic quietness, despite pressing issues such as allegations of environmental contamination in the Hickory Woods neighborhood of South Buffalo and chronic poverty and urban blight. This was speculated as being due to reticence on the part of would-be candidates to \\"challenge a powerful and well-liked mayor like Masiello\\", especially one with a campaign fund in excess of $1 million. It was also only the second time in history when the Democrats and Republicans endorsed the same candidate for mayor of Buffalo, a phenomenon made possible by New York State's electoral fusion law.  Democratic primary  Masiello's opponent in the primary was Beverly A. Gray, who had served as an at-large member of the Buffalo Common Council since 1996. Despite her endorsement by fellow Councilmember Charley Fisher, and her candidacy's survival in the face of electoral petition challenges and her own health problems, Gray was badly outspent by Masiello, and her campaign was hampered by criticism by Erie County Democratic Party chairman G. Steven Pigeon of her tenure on the Council as \\"divisive\\" and \\"extremist\\", and of her mayoral campaign as devoid of a coherent message and failing to make a real effort to reach voters outside the African-American community. The Democratic primary election took place on September 25, 2001; Masiello placed first with 20,980 votes cast, or 72.4% of the total, with Gray receiving 7,988 votes, or 27.6% of the total.  General election  The general election was held on November 6, 2001. Masiello was the only official candidate in an election that was marked by historically low voter turnout, with 37,685 votes, or 98.6% of the total, going to him. Masiello's closest challenger was neighborhood activist Judith Einach, whose independent write-in campaign garnered 523 votes, or 1.4% of the total. The Buffalo News and other local media outlets were criticized by some for their lack of coverage of Einach's campaign. = Other potential candidates = Early in the race, New York State Assemblyman Sam Hoyt and Buffalo Common Council president (and contender in the previous Democratic primary) Jim Pitts, both Democrats, were speculated as possible candidates. Both declined to run. Erie County Legislator Gregory Olma explored a run as a Democrat, but said he would not officially contest the Democratic primary unless he was cross-endorsed by the Erie County Republican Party, an endorsement that ultimately went to Masiello. Local attorney and government reform advocate Kevin Gaughan also sought the endorsement of both the Democratic and Republican parties. Gaughan's candidacy was controversial from the beginning, as he was a resident of the suburb of Hamburg until May 2001, taking advantage of an oversight in the rewriting of the city charter the previous year that eliminated the requirement for mayoral candidates to have lived in Buffalo for at least one year prior to the election. An effort by the Buffalo Common Council in response to Gaughan's candidacy to amend the charter was ultimately shelved, but Gaughan dropped out of the race in June after having lost the crucial Republican endorsement to Masiello. Buffalo Common Councilman-at-Large Charley H. Fisher initially declined to run, but in early April 2001 said that he would challenge Masiello for the Democratic primary if neither Gray nor Pitts officially entered the race by April 24, calling the prospect of Masiello running unopposed in the primary \\"a disservice to the City of Buffalo\\" and remarking that the incumbent did not \\"deserve a free ride\\". Fisher was also reported to have sought the Independence Party endorsement, which ultimately went to Masiello. Fisher dropped out of the race after Gray officially announced her candidacy on April 25. = Party endorsements = Masiello was endorsed by the Democratic, Republican, Independence, and Conservative Parties. The Liberal, Working Families, Right to Life, and Green Parties declined to endorse any candidate. =Results= References Category:2001 New York (state) elections Buffalo Category:Government of Buffalo, New York Category:Mayoral elections in Buffalo, New York Category:November 2001 events in the United States ","title":"2001 Buffalo mayoral election"},{"id":"40117921","text":"Edgar Viguers Seeler (1867-1929) was an American architect.

The episode is written by series creator Veena Sud and directed by Nicole Kassell. In the episode, Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) spends Ray Seward's (Peter Sarsgaard) remaining twelve hours with him. He allows his son Adrian (Rowan Longworth) to visit, but Becker (Hugh Dillon) denies entry. Seward's execution occurs, despite Linden's belief that he is innocent of his wife's murder. Plot Twelve hours before the execution, Seward's execution team conducts a run-through of the hanging. Linden arrives to ask Seward if he recognizes any of four unidentified rings that were recently recovered. He identifies a fake silver wedding band that he gave Trisha by noting a scratch inside the band. In the prison waiting room, she calls the state attorney general to request a stay of execution for Seward. She thinks more evidence could be in the Seward file and calls Holder (Joel Kinnaman) to ask him to bring it to the prison. At Seward's cell, Becker tells him about the unclaimed bodies in the prison cemetery. He asks Seward who is claiming him, then informs Henderson (Aaron Douglas) he's on watch until the 6 p.m. execution. Adrian and his adoptive mother (Ingrid Torrence) join Linden at the prison. Becker summons Linden to see Seward. She tells Seward she's waiting for photos which show Trisha wearing the wedding ring. He asks about Adrian and Becker ends the visit. Linden threatens to call Becker's captain and notes that D.O.C. policy grants Seward a right to speak with visitors for another five hours. She joins Seward again and he tells her he fears a slow death, to which she urges him to see his son. He proclaims himself a \\"monster\\" who beat his wife. She replies she's trying to save him to correct her own mistake. She meets an intoxicated Holder in the waiting room. He gives her the Seward file and comments that the scratched ring is a long shot. While taking a smoke break in the prison courtyard, he sees Adrian, who comments on his intoxication. Inside, Linden tells Seward the A.G. will soon have a photo of Trisha wearing the identified ring, then again urges him to see his son. She speaks with the A.G., who considers a stay. Adrian apologizes to her for lying about Joe Mills. He didn't want his dad to get in trouble again, but adds that Ray is the man he saw in the apartment the night of the murder. Holder returns from a beer run and discovers the prison cemetery. Still upset, he begins to throw beer cans at the anonymous tombstones. Inside, Seward laughs when Linden says the AG is considering a stay. Becoming angry, she asks him why he was in the apartment on the night of the murder, why he played her. She marches into the prison parking lot, where Holder accuses her of always running away from situations. She then gets a call from the AG. Seward's stay has been denied. Back inside, she tells Seward the news and he thanks her for trying. He says he returned to the apartment because he wanted to take Adrian away and give him a better life. He then agrees to see his son. Adrian checks his appearance in the men's room mirror and Holder fixes Adrian's hair using liquid soap as styling gel. While waiting for Adrian, Seward mentions building a treehouse for him in the park. Out in the hall, Becker blocks Adrian and his mother at a gate, then informs Seward and Linden that visiting hours are officially over. Seward screams at the guards, as Linden tells him to look out his window. She calls the district attorney to remedy the situation. Holder takes her phone, telling her it's over. The guards dress Seward for the hanging, then escort him to the gallows. En route, he stops to look out a window and sees Linden standing with Adrian just outside the prison fence. His son waves to him. Linden sits in the viewing gallery as the warden reads his death sentence. Seward is given a chance to make a final statement. He comments on Salisbury steak being ground beef and asks to get on with the execution. Becker falters when the time comes to place the hood over Seward's head and Henderson takes his place. The trapdoor opens, and Seward's body falls through. As he feared, his neck does not snap. Linden watches in horror as Seward slowly chokes to death.  Production  In an interview about the episode, series creator and writer Veena Sud spoke about how she decided to end Ray Seward's story this way: \\"We debated a little bit what should be the end of Ray's story, and very quickly realized: Let's tell the truth. And let the audience have their heart broken in the way the families of these prisoners have their hearts broken. It's a great credit to Peter [Sarsgaard] that over time we get to really understand that this man ‚Äî and everybody ‚Äî has humanity. Everybody has a reason for what they do, good and bad. It doesn't always end well.\\" In the same interview, Peter Sarsgaard (Ray Seward) spoke about the episode: \\"I had lots of anxiety. It‚Äôs interesting playing Ray, because I so in my heart believe that I‚Äôm guilty ‚Äî because I am guilty on some level ‚Äî that it wasn‚Äôt like I was filled with self-righteous indignation. He‚Äôs not the right guy to be defending himself. He‚Äôs filled with a lot of self-loathing. In terms of acting it, I was really excited to act with Mireille. She was the first person to have told me that Episode 10 would be a lot of the two of us...I was really excited about that.\\" Reception =Critical reception= \\"Six Minutes\\" received critical acclaim from most reviewers, with many naming the episode as one of the best in the series. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix thought \\"Six Minutes\\" was \\"largely an illustration of the things that The Killing can do very well, given both its structure and the personnel on-hand. But it was also at times a reminder of the limitations of this particular creative team.\\" Chris King of TVOvermind stated, \\"For a show as dark and gritty as The Killing, this may have been the show's bleakest episode to date, but the sad tone and difficult material did not take away from the astounding performances...and the expertly written drama that filled 'Six Minutes' from beginning to end.\\" The A.V. Club's Phil Dyess-Nugent gave the episode a perfect \\"A\\" grade, to become the best-reviewed episode of the entire series by that website. =Ratings= The episode was watched by 1.47 million viewers with a rating of 0.4 in the 18-49 ages demographic, a slight rise from the previous episode.

In the 100m he qualified through his heat in first position in a time of 12.11s, a new Paralympic record. In the final he shave three thousands of that record, taking the Paralympic title and pushing Graeme Ballard (Great Britain) and Roman Pavlyk (Ukraine) into silver and bronze positions. There were no qualifier rounds for the 400m T36 event and Shvetcov's results leading into the Games were strong enough to see him in the final. The podium finish of the 400m saw another Britain take silver, Paul Blake and Pavlyk again take bronze, while Shetcov's final time of 53.31s set a new world record giving him the gold medal. For Shetcov's third event of the Paralympic Games, the 800m, he arrived as one of the title favourites, having set a new world record a few months earlier when he ran 2:05.05 at the 2012 European Championships in Stadskanaal. In the Paralympic final he maintained his form to finish just outside his record with a time of 3:05:34 pushing fellow Russian Artem Arefyev into second place. =2013 to 2016= The next year Shvetcov entered the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon as one of the favourites. He failed to disappoint picking up four gold medals, this time all in the sprint events. In contrast to the Paralympics he added the 200m and 4 √ó 100 m relay to his roster, and showed his class by setting a new world record in the heats of the T36 100m, recording a time of 11.92s, the first time a T36 athlete has run under 12 seconds. He then went on to beat his own world record the next day when he took gold in the final with a time of 11.90 seconds. Shvetcov added two more international gold medals when he travelled to Swansea in Wales to compete in the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships. In poor weather conditions he added retained his 100m title from Stadskanaal and added the 200m title. The following year he suffered a rare defeat when he was beaten by Ballard in the 100m at the Berlin Grand Prix. Shvetcov was keen to regain his World Championship titles, and his new training regime focused on the sprint events, including his favourite distance, the 400m.

Education and early career Bagenal, known by his second name, Hope, was born in Dublin, but the family moved to England when he was two years old. He attended various schools as his father moved first to the North, and then to East Anglia, finishing at Uppingham School. From 1905 to 1909 he studied engineering at Leeds University, but left without qualifying. He then joined an architectural practice in London and studied at the Architectural Association. In 1911 Bagenal joined Edwin Cooper and worked on the Port of London Authority building. By March 1914, Bagenal was in contact with Wallace Sabine, who was studying the link between reverberation and absorption in auditorium design. Bagenal, with his engineering background, recognised the significance of this work to the architectural profession, and developed a career in acoustics consultancy. Bagenal, at that time attracted by the Quakers, volunteered for the Royal Army Medical Corps and was sent to Flanders, from where he wrote a series of articles, and poems. At the end of the Great War, the best were reprinted in Fields and Battlefields under the pseudonym No. 31540. He published further anthologies in 1932 and 1940. He was wounded at the Somme, where he was awarded the DCM, and convalesced at the army's 1st Eastern General Hospital, Cambridge. Here he met the physicist Alex Wood, with whom he later wrote the pioneering text, Planning for Good Acoustics (1931). Acoustic consultancy He resumed his architectural career in 1917 and moved into Leaside, a cottage in the Lea Valley, with his extended family in a house partly dating back to early 1800s, surrounded by ancient woodland. The house in due course became a refuge and meeting place for numerous visitors, from explorers (Sandy Wollaston) to musicians (Toni and Rosi Grunschlag), from psychiatrists (John Layard and Donald Winnicott) to artists (Elinor Darwin and Margaret Calkin James), all held captive by the genius loci of the valley and the warmth and hospitality of the family who lived there. He returned to the Architectural Association as librarian and editor of the AA Journal, and developed his acoustics consultancy. He was as adviser to Charles Cowles-Voysey for the White Rock Pavilion, Hastings and subsequently worked on most of the major concert hall, theatre, and civic halls in the United Kingdom. His international work included the New Delhi Legislative Chamber, the Sydney Opera House and the New York Lincoln Center. He toured widely, drawing and photographing classical buildings, and studied in Italy and Greece in 1925 and 1926. With Robert Atkinson he wrote the Theory and Elements of Architecture (1926), on the foundations of classicism. During World War II, Bagenal worked at the Building Research Station as a scientific officer. In the post-war years his work afforded him further opportunities to travel. Bagenal played a pivotal role in establishing the acoustic research agenda in Britain, introducing advances in the science to the British construction industry. Throughout his career, Bagenal was preoccupied with the acquisition of measured acoustic data from myriad sites, ranging from cathedrals to concert halls, inserting this corpus of information into his ongoing refinement of predictive models that were to established as principles for design and construction. Among his most important acoustics projects were the refurbishment of the Royal Albert Hall and the construction of the Royal Festival Hall., the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, and the Fairfield Halls, Croydon. As consultant to the Building Research Station during the 1960s Bagenal investigated the weathering of buildings in London. His prolific writings expanded into new areas, including topography, history, and theology. Reputation Bagenal was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and his work was recognised by the state in 1956 when he was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. In 1975, Bagenal was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Institute of Acoustics. In the 1940s, the Building Research Station constructed three blocks of flats at Abbots Langley to test new building methods, including acoustic insulation. They were named Bagenal House, Rayleigh House, and Sabine House. In a play of letters, the nomenclature not only made reference to the initials of the BRS, it also paid homage to three significant contributors to the development of architectural acoustics. As the Dictionary of National Biography records, Hope Bagenal could be intimidating and remote: physically tall and gaunt, difficult to know, intolerant of fools, yet generous with those with whom he found an intellectual rapport. The two major technical books to which he contributed remain classics in their genres. Publications Bagenal wrote standard text books on architecture and acoustics, but also on more general issues, as can be seen in the bibliography below. He wrote extensively on classical architecture, combining direct observation of Greek and Roman sites with speculation about the origin of classical forms, the relationship between architecture, geology, climate and landscape, and the symbolic content of architectural form. In the 1970s, Bagenal wrote a series of letters to his niece. In these he retraced his life until 1918 and his Anglo-Irish heritage. They cover his childhood, his days serving as a sergeant in the RAMC, the interesting people he met in Cambridge with his wife, Alison, during his convalescence there in 1916, his interest in acoustics and his early days as an architect. .

In the sheep liver fluke, for example, the cirrus is the worm's muscular penis and when not in use is retained within a cirrus sac or pouch near the animal's head. The same structure exists in the various Taenia species of tapeworm. In the clam worms, however, the cirrus is the tentacular process or growth on each of the feet (parpodia), either the dorsal cirrus or the ventral cirrus, and has nothing to do with reproduction. Among the bristleworms, a cirrus is a tentacular growth near the head or notopodium containing sense organs and may be either dorsal, ventral, or lamellar. Among the ribbonworms, the caudal cirrus is a small thread-like growth at the posterior end of the worm. Among feather stars or barnacles, a cirrus is a long slender gripping or feeding appendage. In sea lilies, the cirri are the thin strands that line the animal's stalk. Among the tube blennies, a cirrus is a long growth extending from above the eye (a supraorbital cirrus) or extending below the neck-region (a nuchal cirrus). In a nautilus, each of the animal's tentacles is composed of a thin flexible cirrus and the corresponding hardened and protective cirrus sheath into which the cirri may be withdrawn.

The title comes from a 1901 song which is featured in the cartoon. Plot Toby is the pilot of a paddle steamer. One day he docks his boat at a harbor to pick up passengers. As he has to shake hands with just about everyone who comes aboard, Toby struggles to keep a smile on his face. When the boat finally leaves the harbor, the passengers are treated to some entertainment as the flapper girl in a dainty gown sings the song \\"Mississippi Mud\\" at the center of the main deck. Everybody else sings along too, and stomps as well. But as they stomp harder and harder, the boat starts to shake. The shake is so strong that almost everybody, including Toby, gets thrown overboard. The boat isn't completely vacant as the flapper girl is still on board. Not liking to be alone there, she yells for help. Toby, trailing behind, swims to reach her. The boat then approaches a waterfall but Toby is able to reach it and gets back on board in time. He then moves the paddle wheels from the sides to the front. As the boat reaches the edge of the waterfall, the paddle wheels at the front work like aircraft propellers, enabling it to fly. Relieved of her troubles, the flapper girl kisses Toby.

His magnum opus, the eight-volume The Historical Atlas of China, was published between 1982 and 1988. He was elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1981. Early life Tan Qixiang was born on 25 February 1911 at the Huanggutun railway station in Shenyang, Liaoning. Soon after his birth, he was brought back to his hometown of Jiaxing, Zhejiang. After attending Xiuzhou High School in Jiaxing, he briefly studied sociology at the Shanghai University in 1926 before transferring to Jinan University (then located in Shanghai), where he graduated from the history department in 1930. In 1930, he entered the graduate school of Yenching University in Peiping (now Beijing), where he studied under the prominent historian Gu Jiegang and graduated in 1932. Career From 1932 to 1936, he worked as a lecturer of historical geography and history at several universities in Peiping, including Yenching, Fu Jen Catholic University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University. In the 1930s, Gu and Tan cofounded the Yugong Society (Á¶πË¥°Â≠¶‰ºö) and the journal Chinese Historical Geography (Chinese name Yugong). In 1940, Tan joined Zhejiang University and then relocated to inland Guizhou province due to the Japanese invasion of China, as an associate professor. In 1946, after the surrender of Japan, Tan moved to Hangzhou with Zhejiang University, which was moved back to its original campus. From 1947 to 1949, he taught at both Zhejiang University and his alma mater Jinan University in Shanghai. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Jinan University was closed, and most of its departments were merged into Fudan University. Tan became a history professor at Fudan, where he stayed for the rest of his career. He was the head of the Department of History of Fudan starting in 1957 and became an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1981. From 1982 to 1986, he served as director of the Institute of Historical Geography of China at Fudan University. The Historical Atlas of China The Historical Atlas of China His most important work is The Historical Atlas of China, which is also regarded as the most significant work in the field of historical geography in China. He began working on the atlas in 1955 and partly based it on the work of Qing dynasty scholar Yang Shoujing. It took him more than 30 years to complete the work, and the eight-volume atlas was published from 1982 to 1988. The atlas consists of 304 maps covering the thousands of years of Chinese history until the Qing Dynasty and includes over 70,000 place names. The atlas contains many maps that are politically sensitive, especially on Tibet and Xinjiang. According to his student Ge Jianxiong, Tan was under strong political pressure to make the historical Tibet appear smaller, but he insisted on being faithful to history and included Xinjiang as Tibetan territory during the late 8th century, and his version was eventually approved by China's then-reformist leader, Hu Yaobang. Students His students include Wang Zhongshu, who studied history with him at Zhejiang University and later became one of the most prominent archaeologists in Asia. At Fudan University, students Zhou Zhenhe and Ge Jianxiong, now well-known historians, were the first two recipients of the doctoral degree in humanities (ÊñáÁßëÂçöÂ£´) in the People's Republic of China.

He has been described as effectively a professional textbook writer. After the failure of his school, he worked as an actuary.Alexander Jamieson, celestial map maker (abstract), by Ian Ridpath. Life Some of Jamieson's background is obscure. He was born at Rothesay, Bute, to William Jamieson, a wheelwright, and Margaret Stewart. In 1821 he obtained a degree of M.A. from Marischal College, Aberdeen, and an LL.D. there in 1823. In 1825 he was admitted as a sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, and became a ten-year man. In 1826 he became a member of the Astronomical Society of London. Jamieson was active in the period 1814‚Äì1846 writing textbooks and running a school. In 1824 it was teaching at Heston House on Hounslow Heath, where some Hindustani was on the syllabus. From 1826 to 1838 it was at Wyke House Academy in Middlesex, which was advertised as a preparation for the Army, Navy, civil engineers, architects and surveyors. Among his pupils there was George Windsor Earl; John Rouse Bloxam also taught there. Jamieson was declared bankrupt in 1838. He then worked as an actuary. Towards the end of his life he suffered a stroke, then moved to Bruges in Belgium with his wife Frances (n√©e Thurtle), known as a writer, whom he had married in 1820. She was the author of the relatively successful Ashford Rectory; or, The Spoiled Child Reformed.

See the bookseller catalogue Women Writers R‚ÄìZ (London: Jarndyce, 2012). . He died in Bruges on 6 July 1850. Works Jamieson was the author of two highly successful grammars: A Grammar of Rhetoric and Polite Literature (1818, at least 53 American editions) and A Grammar of Logic and Intellectual Philosophy (1819 and at least ten American editions). The former drew on Hugh Blair's Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, and the Philosophy of Rhetoric of George Campbell, of which Jamieson published an abridgement in 1823. Jamieson also abridged the Elements of Criticism by Lord Kames. All these Scottish authors, along with Alexander Bain, were widely used in 19th-century American colleges for rhetoric texts; and the Grammar of Jamieson went through 24 editions by 1844. It quoted freely from Joseph Addison and Mark Akenside, as well as sources such as Shakespeare and John Milton, and was a typical text of the female education of the period. The Grammar of Rhetoric combined Blair, Campbell, and Kames with the Lectures on Belles Lettres and Logic (1806) of William Barron and the grammar of Lindley Murray. Other works were: Cover of A Celestial Atlas by Alexander Jamieson *A Treatise on the Construction of Maps *A Grammar of Universal Geography (1820?, 1823) *A Celestial Atlas (1822) This work was inspired by the star atlas of Johann Elert Bode, but restricted itself to stars that could be seen with the naked eye.

According to historical evidence, his first contact with Christian pamphlets occurred in 1836 when he directly received American Congregationalist missionary Edwin Stevens' personal copy of the Good Words to Admonish the Age (by Liang Fa, 1832).

Subsequently, Hong had supposedly experienced mystical visions in the wake of his third failure of the imperial examinations in 1837 and after failing for a fourth time in 1843, he sat down to carefully examine the tracts with his distant cousin Feng Yunshan, believing that they were \\"the key to interpreting his visions\\" coming to the conclusion that he was \\"the son of God the Father and the younger brother of Jesus Christ who had been directed to rid the world of demon worship.\\"Jen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 15-18 (1973)Jen Yu- wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 20 (1973)Jonathan D.

Spence, God's Chinese Son Chapter 19 (1996) Hong Xiuquan was merely regarded as the second eldest son of God after Jesus Christ, with Feng Yunshan as third eldest son, and Yang Xiuqing the fourth eldest.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son Chapter 15 (1996) Formation Beginning with Robert Morrison in 1807, Protestant missionaries began working from Macao, Pazhou (known at the time as \\"Whampoa\\"), and Guangzhou (\\"Canton\\"). Their household staff and the printers they employed for Morrison's dictionary and translation of the Bible‚Äîmen like Cai Gao, Liang Afa, and Qu Ya'ang‚Äîwere their first converts and suffered greatly, being repeatedly arrested, fined, and driven into exile at Malacca. However, they corrected and adapted the missionaries' message to reach the Chinese, printing thousands of tracts of their own devising. Unlike the westerners, they were able to travel through the interior of the country and began to particularly frequent the prefectural and provincial examinations, where local scholars competed for the chance to rise to power in the imperial civil service. One of the native tracts, Liang's nine-part, 500-page tome called Good Words to Admonish the Age, found its way into the hands of Hong Xiuquan in the mid-1830s, although it remains a matter of debate during which exact examination this occurred. Hong initially leafed through it without interest. Feng Yunshan formed the Society of God Worshippers, in Guangxi after a missionary journey there in 1844 to spread Hong's ideas. In 1847, Hong became the leader of the secret society. The Taiping faith, inspired by missionary Christianity, says one historian, \\"developed into a dynamic new Chinese religion... Taiping Christianity\\". Hong presented this religion as a revival and a restoration of the ancient classical faith in Shangdi, a faith that had been displaced by Confucianism and dynastic imperial regimes.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 25, 64-65, 67 (1996) The next year, Hong and Feng Yunshan, Hong's distant cousinJen Yu-wen, The Taiping Revolutionary Movement 22-23 (1973) and one of the earliest converts to Hong's faith,Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 67, 69, 80 (1996) traveled to Sigu, Guiping county, Guangxi to preach their version of Christianity.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 71 (1996) In November 1844, Hong returned home without Feng, who remained in the area and continued to preach.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 78-79 (1996) After Hong's departure, Feng traveled deeper and deeper into the heart of the Thistle Mountain region, preaching and baptizing new converts.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 79-80 (1996) Feng christened this group of believers the \\"God Worshipping Society.\\"Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 80 (1996) Hakkas from this area, generally poor and beset by both bandits and local Chinese families angry at the presence of the Hakka in their ancestral lands, found refuge in the group with its promise of solidarity.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 81, 88 (1996) While the God Worshipping Society shared some similar characteristics with traditional Chinese secret societies, it differed in that the participants adopted a new religious faith that firmly rejected Chinese tradition as for the one established by the Manchu regime, since they believed that they were following the Chinese tradition, but the original, the Han tradition.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 29 (1966) The Society was militant from its inception, due to the prevalence of both intervillage fighting and conflicts between Hakka and non-Hakka villagers.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 30 (1966) Generally, individuals did not convert alone, but rather entire families, clans, occupational groups, or even villages would convert en masse. On August 27, 1847, when Hong Xiuquan returned to the Thistle Mountains, the God Worshipers numbered over 2,000.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 95 (1996)Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 31 (1966) At this time, most God Worshippers were peasants and miners. Growth With Hong's return, the God Worshipping Society took on a more rebellious character. Hong began to describe himself as a king and explicitly identified the ruling Manchus and their supporters as demons which must be destroyed.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 31-32 (1966) The God Worshippers treated their entire community as a family, leading to establishment of a common treasury and a requirement of chastity.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 33 (1966) In January 1848, Feng Yunshan was arrested and banished to Guangdong.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 34-35 (1966) Hong Xiuquan left for Guangdong shortly thereafter to reunite with Feng.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 35-37 (1966) In the absence of both Feng and Hong, two new leaders emerged to fill the void: Yang Xiuqing and Xiao Chaogui.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 35 (1966) Both claimed to enter trances which allowed them to speak as a member of the Trinity; God the Father in the case of Yang and Jesus Christ in the case of Xiao. While speaking as Jesus or God the Father, Xiao and Yang would necessarily have more authority than even Hong Xiuquan.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 36 (1966) Upon their return in the summer of 1849, Hong and Feng investigated Yang and Xiao's claims and declared them to be genuine.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 37 (1966) Jintian Uprising In February 1850, local corps passed through a number of God Worshipping villages and threatened to kill the converts. In response, Feng Yunshan began to call for open revolt by the God Worshippers. In July 1850, the God Worshipper's leaders directed their followers to converge in Jintian and quickly amassed a force of 10,000-30,000 people.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 39 (1966) While the majority of the group were Hakka, some followers were Punti, Miao, or members of other local tribal groups.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 40-41 (1966) Membership in the God Worshippers was eclectic; they counted businessmen, refugees, farmers, mercenaries, and members of secret societies and mutual-protection alliances among their ranks.Pamela Kyle Crossley, The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800 104 (2010) The God Worshippers were also joined by a number of bandit groups, including several thousand pirates led by Luo Dagang.Franz H. Michael, The Taiping Rebellion: History 40 (1966) The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom On the 11th day of the first lunar month of 1851, which was also Hong Xiuquan's birthday, the God Worshipping Society proclaimed the Jintian Uprising against the ruling Qing dynasty, and declared the formation of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, thus beginning the Taiping Rebellion, which has been described as the \\"most gigantic man-made disaster\\" of the nineteenth century.

The initial core of the rebels were Tiandihui secret societies that were involved in both revolutionary activity and organised crime, such as prostitution, piracy and opium smuggling. Many lodges were formed originally for self-defence in feuds between locals and migrants from neighbouring provinces. They were organised into scattered local lodges each under a lodge- master (Â†Ç‰∏ª), and in October 1854 elected Li Wenmao and Chen Kai as joint alliance-masters (Áõü‰∏ª). In Summer 1854, 50,000 outlaws, proclaiming a restoration of the Ming dynasty, captured Qingyuan. This roused the Tiandihui to revolt in the city of Conghua, forty miles Northeast of the provincial capital. The Red Turbans were formed by religious members from Tiandihui, such as Qiu Ersao who joined the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom with thousands more. In September, forces commanded by Taiping-affiliated Ling Shiba captured Luoding and made it their headquarters.Wakeman, Strangers at the Gate pp. 132-133 Ling Shiba was a member of the Tiandihui.Yeh Ming-Ch'en: Viceroy of Liang Kuang 1852-8 By J. Y. Wong, Senior Lecturer in History J Y WongGuangdong and Chinese Diaspora: The Changing Landscape of Qiaoxiang - Yow Cheun Hoe - Google Books Viceroy of Guangdong Xu Guangjin (ÂæêÂª£Á∏â) sent braves (Âãá, or irregular militia) to the border to deal with the situation, but these mostly defected to the rebels. Provincial governor Ye Mingchen then formulated a strategy of bribing lodge leaders to defect, which was successful in bringing Ling to heel, and the Emperor promoted him to Viceroy. Ye would later be in charge of purging Guangdong of any anti-government outlaw. Over one million people from Guangdong were sentenced to death and executed. Cantonese dissatisfaction of the Qing state resulted in the growth of lawlessness, while flooding of the Pearl River added to their economic woes. The Taiping victory in the capture of Nanjing galvanised the Tiandihui to redouble their revolutionary efforts. A group, allied with the Small Swords Society in neighbouring Fujian province, succeeded in seizing the city of Huizhou, and rebel leader He Liu proceeded to capture the city of Dongguan, followed by Chen Kai's capture of the major city of Foshan on 4 July 1854. Guangdong province and neighbouring provinces in South China The Red Turbans did not succeed in taking the city of Guangzhou, but fought through much of the country round it for more than a year. Failure to coordinate had exhausted the supplies of the rebel alliance, and they faltered during the attack on the provincial capital Guangzhou where the gentry had succeeded in raising a force of militia to defend the city alongside the British Royal Navy which intervened on the government side. By 1856, after failing to capture Guangzhou, Red Turban forces, hoping to continue to resist the Qing state, retreated north and occupied parts of Guangxi province, proclaiming the Dacheng Kingdom and managed to hold out for nine years, others fighting their way through government-held territory in Hunan province and finally to Jiangxi province where they coalesced with the Taiping forces of Shi Dakai; some of these were consolidated as the Flower Flag Force (Ëä±ÊóóÂÜõ) of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Many were crushed by the Xiang Army en route. The British involvement in the counter-insurgency by selling British weaponry to government forces and allowing the Chinese shipping carrying them to avoid rebel attack by using the British flag, would lead to the Second Opium War when a pirate ship with a British flag was captured by Chinese government forces.

Description The Souldiers Pocket Bible (lacking a possessive apostrophe in the title) was first issued in 1643 to Cromwell's army and was put in general use among his soldiers. It has been of historical record that Cromwell's soldiers were provided with a small pocket Bible. George Livermore, an American book collector from Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, discovered a copy of The Souldiers Pocket Bible in 1854; he realized that the Bible which Cromwell's soldiers were known to carry was not the complete Protestant Bible of 66 books, but a condensed pamphlet version. It was an octavo booklet (5¬Ω √ó 3‚Ä≥, 136 √ó 78mm). In comparison, it was about the size and thickness of an international travel passport used in the 20th century. The Souldiers Pocket Bible had just 16 pages that contained some 150 verse quotations from the Geneva Bible, all related to war. All but four of the verses were from the Old Testament. Verses intended to inspire the morale of Cromwell's soldiers included the following from the Geneva Bible: :* Deuteronomy 20:4 ‚Äì For the Lord your God goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, and to save you. :* Exodus 14:14 ‚Äì The Lord shall fight for you. The 150 war-related verses were organized in sixteen sections. Cromwell helped select some of the verses used and supervised the editing of The Souldiers Pocket Bible by Edmund Calamy. Section headers for the verses included the following: :A Souldier must not doe wickedly :A Souldier must be valiant for God[']s cause :A Souldier must love his enemies as they are his enemies, and hate them as they are god[']s enemies :A Souldier must consider that sometimes God[']s people have the worst in battel as well as God[']s enemies. This condensed Souldiers Pocket Bible was usually buttoned on the inside waistcoat, placed near the heart, and under the soldier's outer coat. The placement did not hinder the movements of the soldier. English Puritan church leader Richard Baxter relates a story that the life of one of Cromwell's soldiers was saved by his carrying a copy of The Souldiers Pocket Bible near his heart; a bullet fired at him became lodged in the pamphlet instead of his heart. Purpose Cromwell's military success was largely due to the training of his soldiers. However The Souldiers Pocket Bible was used for religious inspiration and to help influence good morals and rigid discipline. Before Cromwell's soldiers went into battle, they would pray and sing religious songs from the Book of Psalms. According to Cromwell, his soldiers never lost a battle after The Souldiers Pocket Bible was issued to them in 1643. Legacy The Christian Soldier's Penny Bible (1693); a version of The Souldiers Pocket Bible (1643) Two copies exist of the 1643 edition of The Souldiers Pocket Bible. The London copy was presented by George III to the British Museum. The only other 1643 copy known is found in the United States and was once owned by the prominent 19th-century book collector George Livermore. The work was reissued in 1693 under the title The Christian Soldier's Penny Bible. The British Museum has the only 1693 copy known to exist. This version is similar to The Souldiers Pocket Bible except for changes to some of the \\"Headers\\" and minor alterations in the text. The latter reflect the King James Version of the Bible rather than the Geneva Bible text used for the 1643 edition. In 1861 Riverside Press reprinted one hundred copies of the 1643 text in facsimile for Livermore. At the time of the American Civil War, the American Tract Society printed The Soldier's Pocket Bible in large numbers to serve as a religious manual for the Northern troops. About fifty thousand copies of The Soldier's Pocket Bible were reprinted for the troops at that time. The Souldiers Pocket Bible was the first of the shortened, concise Bible versions that became popular for distribution to troops by military authorities and for use by individuals for personal guidance and inspiration.

Early life  George Livermore was born July 10, 1809, at Cambridgeport, Massachusetts. His parents were Deacon Nathaniel Livermore and Elizabeth (Gleason) Livermore. His English ancestor, John Livermore, who emigrated from Ipswich, England in 1634 to the United States in 1634, settled in Watertown, Massachusetts, and was believed to be the progenitor for the Livermore family members in the United States. Young George Livermore attended both public and private elementary schools at Cambridgeport. He pursued college-prep courses in addition to the normal elementary school courses. One of his private school classmates was the poet Oliver Wendell Holmes. Others at his school included Richard H. Dana and Margaret Fuller. Livermore began to purchase books from Boston sales in his spare time.  Mid-life and career  For reasons of health, in 1823, at the age of fourteen, Livermore decided to go directly into the workplace rather than attending college. He left school and went to work with his older brothers, Isaac and Marshall. They were merchants at Cambridgeport, where they ran a store. The only additional schooling Livermore had was in 1827-28, when he was 18 years old. He took some courses in English and Latin at Deerfield Academy. In 1829 Livermore went to Waltham, Massachusetts, some eight miles away, and became a dry-goods clerk and salesman in a store for a year. He returned to Cambridge in 1830 and went to work in his father's shop making fancy soaps. In the later part of 1830, the owner of the dry-goods store asked Livermore to return to his store in Waltham, offering higher pay. Livermore accepted the offer and returned to Waltham. In the spring of 1831, the owner of the dry-goods store offered Livermore a two-year lease to operate the business on his own. With encouragement from his friends, he took the opportunity to operate his own business and started officially in April 1831. Livermore ran the business with profit for the two years and returned the business to the original owner as per the lease agreement. Since he had never left the state of Massachusetts, he decided to do some traveling in 1833. Livermore went first to Maine, then New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. While returning to Massachusetts, he went to West Point and Saratoga, New York. On his travels to Washington D.C., he visited President Andrew Jackson. Livermore was employed in the shoe and leather business in Boston in 1834. In this business he did a lot of traveling. In the winter of 1834-35, he traveled to New Orleans for several weeks. In 1838 he went into partnership with his older brother Isaac as wool merchants. This afforded him the means to collect more books, as his diary showed. He enjoyed books throughout his life and collected them from an early age. He enjoyed books on history, antiquities, biblical studies, and the history of printing and book binding. Livermore developed what was recognized at the time as one of the finest private libraries in the United States. By 1841 he owned twenty-six volumes (almost a complete set) of the Massachusetts Historical Society‚Äôs Collections and John Winthrop's \\"History of New England\\". Livermore often wrote articles for newspapers; for instance, in 1849 he wrote a series in the Cambridge Chronicle on the New England Primer. He wrote an article for the Christian Examiner on Strickland‚Äôs History of the American Bible Society. In 1850, he wrote an article in the North American Review on public libraries.  Societies  Livermore was a member of the Massachusetts Historical Society beginning in 1849. He was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1849,American Antiquarian Society Members Directory and would later serve on its board of councilors from 1853-1865.Dunbar, B. (1987). Members and Officers of the American Antiquarian Society. Worcester: American Antiquarian Society. He became a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1850 and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855. Livermore was a trustee of the Boston Athenaeum from 1851- 1859, chairing its Library Committee, and later served as its vice-president until his death. He became a trustee of the Massachusetts State Library in 1850. The American Unitarian Association elected Livermore a member of the Executive Committee in 1859.  Church  Livermore's diary shows he participated in church activities throughout his life, including being a Sunday school teacher from time to time. He wrote hymns for Sunday school children. Livermore bought various Bibles for his library book collection. About a quarter of his personal library consisted of Bibles or related Bible literature. One of these was a rare copy of Cromwell's Soldiers' Pocket Bible (1643). This Pocket Bible was a condensed version of the Geneva Bible, containing chiefly war-related verses to inspire the troops, as well as provide moral guidance. Given the printing methods of the time, a complete Bible would have been too bulky for a soldier to carry. Livermore's copy of the 1643 Pocket Bible is one of two copies that have survived into the 21st century. The pamphlet was the first of many condensed versions of the Bible, a form that would become popular for use by military authorities and by individuals. In 1838, Livermore obtained a copy of Coverdale's Bible. Another example of a rare Bible he purchased was a 1478 Venice edition of the Latin Vulgate, once owned by Pope Pius VI (with his coat of arms on the cover). Livermore purchased a copy of the Geneva Bible from Rev. Dr. Homer's personal library in Newton, Massachusetts, which had been presented by Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin to Dr. Homer. This is purportedly the same 1576 copy (with a ghostly outline of the royal arms) given to Queen Elizabeth by the printer. Livermore's library included a bible that had been owned by Adam Winthrop (father of the first Governor of Massachusetts); this copy is now held by the Massachusetts Historical Society.

As an essential part of their faith the warriors used the turban as a store for their expansive range of weapons. \\"Their turban was tied in a unique way, which with time, was established as a norm. Its method and style of tying was not aimed towards pleasing the Almighty, but was in accordance with the rank. The first form of the turban of the Singhs had a thick bamboo stick in the centre and was raised to a measure of nine inches or as long as a hand. And by circling step by step around the bamboo stick, that turban became similar to a tapering tube. When the last section of the turban reached the end of the wooden stick, abreast with the tip of the stick, a part, to the measure of a hand, was left flying loose. While riding or on foot, the flying movement of the loose end of the turban was like a flag, demonstrating their magnificence.\\" Mufti 'Ali ud-Din, Ibratnamah (1854), 1:364-66. Personification Sikhs with chakrams, inscribed \\"Nihang Abchal Nagar\\" (Nihang from Hazur Sahib), 1844 The dark blue tunic (chola) and turban (dumalla) surmounted with quoit and dagger were first worn in 1699 at the time of the first Khalsa initiation ceremony of the double-edged sword (khanda-pahul). Next came the turban-flag (farra or farla), which was introduced by Guru Gobind Singh in 1702 during a clash with a Rajput hill king in the vicinity of Anandpur. The Khalsa's battle standard was cut down when its bearer, Akali Man Singh Nihang, fell wounded. Henceforth, the Guru decided that the dark blue flag should be worn as a part of Man Singh's turban, fluttering from its peak for as long as its bearer had life in him. It is said that the full magnificence of the Akal-Nihang uniform emerged the following year. Guru Gobind Singh set a challenge to his gathered Khalsa warriors to reveal to him the perfect form of Maha Kal (Great Death). After a while, his youngest son, four‚Äìyear‚Äìold Fateh Singh swaggered into court in mesmerising dark blue apparel. Though a child, his uncommon and overpowering bearing was greatly admired, especially by his father. On his head was bound a large dark blue 'turban fortress' (dastar bunga) intricately decorated with an array of sharpened steel daggers as well as a series of quoits and crescents descending in size towards its mountain like peak. A piece of blue cloth‚Äîthe farla‚Äîwas distinctively tied so that it sprouted from the turban's apex. Fateh Singh's manner was fiercer even than that of seasoned Akali-Nihangs such as his mentor, Man Singh. As he stood broad‚Äìchested, his eyes blood‚Äìred with effortful rage, he inspired awe as well as gentle laughter. With folded hands, the Guru bowed reverentially in front of the child. When his perplexed warriors asked the reason for doing so, the Guru explained that he had paid his respect not merely to his son but to the true personification of Maha Kal as worn by the inspired child. The Guru declared that the uniform thus revealed was eminently suitable for the Akali-Nihangs to adopt. It was then that the Singhs also bowed to Fateh Singh. Since he possessed a spirit most like Maha Kal, Baba Fateh Singh (as he came to be known) was acknowledged as the foremost Akali-Nihang Singh. Origin Akali Turban Cotton over a wicker frame, Steel overlaid with gold. Lahore. Mid-19th century. \\"A tall conical turban provided convenient transportation for a number of sharp steel quoits - edged weapons hurled to lethal effect by the practised hand of the Akalis.\\" \\"First introduced by Akali Naina Singh Nihang, this example of the towering turban bristles with miniature blades and a series of war quoits made from brightly polished, razor-sharp steel. The totemic gajgah bound at the front is secured with braided steel wire (tora) and the blue turban cloth; this is meant to cover the stem, leaving only the topmost double-edged dagger or bhagauti and multiple crescents visible. Literally 'grappler of elephants', the gajgah is thought to have been worn in ancient times as an emblem of distinction by powerful warriors, like Bhim of the epic Mahabharat fame, who were capable of single-handedly defeating war elephants. The gajgah is also intimately connected with Shiv's trident, an instrument of both destruction and grace. Its series of crescents climb towards the mountain like peak out of which emerges the flag (farla), representing the Khalsa's battle standard. To achieve this effect, an under-turban (keski) was twisted around the long hair and carefully wound to give the peaked appearance with the end forming the farla. To provide thickness and support at the base a second turban was tied. Quoits and braided wire secured everything in place. The farla was introduced in 1702 after Guru Gobind Singh saw the Khalsa's standard cut down in the thick of battle. He was prompted to tie the flag in the turban of his standard bearer, Akali Man Singh Nihang. Henceforth, a wearer of the farla held a position of utmost respect amongst the Khalsa, so much so that it became the supreme insignia of the warrior brotherhood. Only a Nihang warrior of the Akali rank was permitted to display this mark of the Guru's honour.\\" Etymology The Dastar Bungha consists of a number of weapons some of which are listed below. The word dumalla is a term given to the turban worn by Nihangs that combines a small under-turban (*keski*) and a large over-turban (*dastar*); thought to have been adopted by Sikhs in the times of Guru Har Gobind. The Bungha directly translate to a Tower, fort or residence; a structure specially attached to a Sikh shrine to house pilgrims that also served as a seat of classical learning, a place where weapons are stored. Nihang has various meanings including 'sword', 'without care for life or death', and 'alligator'. All Sikhs who were willing to fight under Guru Gobind Singh were called Nihangs, and collectively they were known as the 'ladlian fauja'. Nihang was the synonymous term used for the Akalis. They are now considered by some a sect of Sikhism. An Akali is a staunch believer in 'Akal', the Timeless One; an 'Immortal'. The original Sikh warriors raised by Guru Hargobind at the 'Akal Takht'. They are also known as Akali Nihangs and are distinguishable by the blue dress, weaponry and speech of Guru Gobind Singh's times, which they have always maintained. A Farla worn by some Akalis it signifies the rank of general amongst the Nihangs, dependent on rank represents a 'Flag'.

Additionally, he was a frequent archival consultant to the United States government. Early life and education Posner was born on August 9, 1892 in Berlin to a wealthy Prussian Lutheran family of both Jewish and Christian heritage. His father, Dr. Carl Posner, was a famous urologist. His uncle, Max Posner, who died ten years before Ernst was born, was an archivist with the Prussian Privy State Archives. Posner attended the University of Berlin where he studied philosophy, history, and languages. He attributed a class that he took with German historian Otto Hintze on U.S. Constitutional history as providing him with the basic knowledge he would need for American history later in his life. Having previously served in the military during peace-time, he rejoined Imperial German Army during World War I on both the Eastern and Western fronts. He fought in the battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. He was wounded in Poland on November 1914. After receiving treatment, he returned, now as a lieutenant, to the front and fought in both Russia and France. In 1918 he was mustered out of the army. He was awarded both the first and second class of the Iron Cross. After the war Posner returned to the University of Berlin where he received his doctorate in February 1920. Later that year he passed the exams necessary to teach in a gymnasium.  Career in Germany  Posner began his professional career working for the Prussian State Privy Archive in 1921. He first began with a proto-archivist position and then became a journeymen archivist. At the Archive he helped alter the arrangement and description for all government records that were newly retired. He also rearranged older archival material dating back to the Prussian monarchy. Eventually he became an administrator charged with the responsibility of the Hausreferent. Concurrently, he was heavily involved in the Prussian Academy of Sciences. He published numerous articles and often lectured at the Institute for Archival Science and Advanced Historical Studies of the Privy Archives. Prussian Privy State Archives  Leaving Germany  In 1937 Albert Brackmann, the Director-General of the Privy State Archives, wrote a letter of recommendation vouching for Posner's archival abilities and popularity. Brackmann did this as a way to vouch for Posner under the early years of Hitler's Nuremberg Laws.\\"Posner's translation of a letter of Albert Brackmann, 21 January 1937, included in a vita attached to a letter of Solon J. Buck to Ernst Posner, 19 September 1939, Solon J. Buck Papers, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., Box 18: \\"Ph-Po.\\" Posner had to take leave of his various positions and in 1937 he and his wife, Kathe, decided to emigrate to the United States. Posner traveled to the United States for two months in the Spring of 1938. With the help of friends, Eugene Andersons of American University in Washington, Waldo Gifford Leland of the American Council of Learned Societies, Solon J. Buck of the National Archives, Posner began to position himself within the world of archives in America. At the National Archives he delivered the Good Friday 1938 lecture on the topic of German archival administration. However, the National Archives was reticent to offer employment to an alien. Posner then traveled to Harvard, Yale,Letter of Ernst Posner to Eugene and Polly Anderson, 25 May 1938, folder #81, vol. 2: \\"Emigration,\\" Posner Papers the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Oberlander Trust looking for any type of employment. Since he was not successful, he eventually returned to Germany. In November 1938, after Kristallnacht, he was arrested and sent to the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp.

Still needing a visa, the Posners ended up in Sweden for four months where he was able to present a lecture entitled \\"Archival Administration in the United States.\\" Soon after, the American Consul General in Stockholm provided the Posners with visas. As his wife was still in Berlin they both made their way separately to London and then to New York without any of their belongings. American University  Career in the United States  The United States National Archives Posner spent the next twenty-two years working at American University. Posner, carrying on the dream of Solon J.

For a period of two years, beginning in 1939, Posner and Buck taught a class entitled \\"The History and Administration of Archives.\\" Most of the students in the class were staff members of the National Archives. This included five archivists who would one day become presidents of the Society of American Archivists: Philip C. Brooks, Oliver W. Holmes, Philip Hamer, Elizabeth Edwards (later Elizabeth Hamer Kegan), and Herbert Angel. When Buck was appointed as the Archivist of the United States in 1941, Posner took control of the influential course. In 1943 Posner gave a famous lecture (later published as \\"Public Records under Military Occupation\\") which was among the first calls for plans to administer captured German records. In November 1944, Posner prepared a report on the German archival profession, including biographical sketches and estimates of political views, for 72 leading German archivists.Eckert, Astrid M. (2012). The Struggle for the Files: The Western Allies and the Return of German Archives After the Second World War. Cambridge University Press. . Retrieved 30 July 2013. He wrote numerous War Department manuals relating to German and Italian record-keeping practices and served as an advisor for the United States Army's Department Records Branch on German documents. These documents were eventually used as evidence at many crucial war crimes trials. Posner‚Äôs German heritage was questioned by many when he applied for citizenship in 1943. For example, Posner was accused by Senator Kenneth McKellar for attempting to make the bombing of the National Archive easier by switching the records boxes from cardboard into steel. However, on February 16, 1944, Buck appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on Independent Agencies and defended Posner. Posner also held various positions at American University. They included acting as the chairman of the History Department (1947 - 1961), director of the School of Social Sciences and Public Affairs (1947 - 1961), and dean of the Graduate School (1955 - 1957). One of his responsibilities as Graduate School dean was counseling prospective students. This included Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis when she was considering working towards an M.A. in history.Philip C. Brooks, \\"The Archival Contributions of Ernst Posner,\\" Indian Archives 18, no. 2 (July‚ÄìDecember 1968): 3 Posner took great pride in one of the courses that he offered during summers entitled \\"The Institute on the Preservation and Administration of Archives\\". According to his own words, \\"[i]t became the prototype of many such courses now being offered in various parts of the country and has helped to create some esprit de corps and to impart professional know how to those working in the archives field.\\" From 1940 - 1967 he published and reviewed articles in the American Archivist, American Historical Review, Der Archivar, Archivum, Indian Archives, and other periodicals. He also essayed articles on archives for Collier's Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia Americana. Posner's 1964 work, American State Archives, ‚Äútold an uncomplimentary story of archival lethargy or neglect in about three quarters of the states of the Union.\\"H. G. Jones, ‚ÄúThe Pink Elephant Revisited,‚Äù American Archivist (Fall 1980): 476 At that time, Posner's research showed that twelve states did not have any official archivists and that nine of those had no formalized system for the management of permanent government records. In the years following the publication of the book many states began to follow the archival standards proposed by Posner. One of Posner's most famous books, published in 1972, is entitled Archives in the Ancient World. Posner sought to record the history of archival administration beginning, as few did before him, the ancient world. In the introduction to the work, he argues that \\"[...] archivists must feel a need to explore the origins of their profession, to understand the circumstances and forces that have determined its evolution, and, with such understanding, to anticipate and-prepare for the future\\". For his role in the development of American archival theory and practice, he was sometimes called \\"the Dean of American archivists.\\" From 1955 - 1956 Posner served as the 11th president of the Society of American Archivists. In 1972, Posner and his wife returned to Europe where they settled in Wiesbaden, Germany.  Selected publications  * Drei Vortr√§ge zum Archivwesen der Gegenwart. Stockholm: Alb.

Blaisdell to wash sand filters used in the treatment of drinking water. The machine was built in 1902 at Blaisdell's privately operated waterworks, which treated the muddy water of the Colorado River for local consumption. Blaisdell patented the device and marketed it throughout the United States. The Yuma filter is now on City of Yuma property, and has been preserved as the first of its kind. With Description The Blaisdell machine traveled along steel tracks laid on top of the walls of rectangular filter basins, bridging the walls with its structure. The washing chamber was lowered from the moving bridge frame into the basin. The chamber measures about wide, deep and long, and contains a diameter circular washing unit. The washing unit stirred the surface of the sand bed, dislodging sediment and flushing it away through two suction pumps at the top of the box, avoiding contamination of the surrounding water. The mechanism was controlled by an operator in a corrugated metal enclosure. The Blaisdell machine was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 18, 1979.

It was formerly placed in the genera Boletus, Xerocomus, and Xerocomellus. It acquired its current name when it was transferred to genus Rheubarbariboletus in 2015. Taxonomy French naturalist Lucien Qu√©let described this species as Boletus armeniacus in 1885, before placing it in the genus Xerocomus in his 1888 work Flore mycologique de la France et des pays limitrophes (Mycological flora of France and neighbouring countries). It was transferred to the new genus Xerocomellus described by Czech mycologist Josef ≈†utara in 2008, and then to Rheubarbariboletus in 2015. Description Fruiting in Monte Arci, Sardinia, Italy The cap is initially globular before expanding to become convex and flattening somewhat; it grows to a diameter of . The cap margin initially adheres to the stipe and has a tendency to become lobed or undulated in age. The cap surface is first somewhat pubescent but later becomes smooth and hairless, and may develop cracks in age. Its color is orangish-apricot, aging to ochre. Tubes are initially pale yellow, but become more vivid in age, and eventually develop greenish-yellow to greenish-olive tones. They will become pale blue upon with bruising. The pores are circular or a bit angular, with the same coloring and bruising reaction as the tubes. The robust stipe measures long by thick. It is usually thicker in the middle or lower region, and its base roots into the substrate. The top part of the stipe is yellow; under this the coloration tends to be masked by a dense and fine reticulation that becomes brown to brownish-crimson in age. In some specimens the stipe cuticle cracks and pointed patches lift from the surface. The flesh is pale yellow in the cap, with a narrow strip of pinkish-yellow under the cuticle; in the stipe, the flesh is orange-ochre, with a reddish tint. The flesh sometimes shows a slight and temporary color change to blue when cut or otherwise injured, but this feature is not consistent. It has a pleasant odor and a fruity-acid taste. Spores are fusiform (spindle shaped), measuring 10‚Äì15 by 4.5‚Äì6 ¬µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club- shaped, four-spored, and contain internal oil droplets; they measure 28‚Äì35 by 9‚Äì12 ¬µm. The cystidia are fusiform, hyaline (translucent), and 40‚Äì55 by 9‚Äì12 ¬µm. Ecology It has been recorded forming ectomycorrhizal association with white poplar (Populus alba) in Hungary. Its ectomycorrhizae contain bright yellow pigments, especially the rhizomorphs, and have warts on the outer surfaces of both the rhizomorphs and the mantle. The ectomycorrhizae of R. armeniacus cannot be reliably distinguished from those of Xerocomus subtomentosus.

The reserve occupies the upper part of the Rock of Gibraltar, a long and narrow mountain that rises to a maximum height of above sea level, and constitutes around 40 per cent of Gibraltar's total land area.Guide to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, p. 3 The unusual geology of the Rock of Gibraltar ‚Äì a limestone peak adjoining a sandstone hinterland ‚Äì provides a habitat for plants and animals, such as the Gibraltar candytuft and Barbary partridge, which are found nowhere else in mainland Europe.Guide to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, p. 9 For many years, the Upper Rock was reserved exclusively for military use; it was fenced off for military purposes, but was decommissioned and converted into a nature reserve in 1993.J. Cortes, \\"Wildlife in Gibraltar\\", Sanctuary magazine, issue 22 (1993), pp. 38-41 The footpaths link many of the fortifications of Gibraltar. They were constructed from the 18th century onwards using chisels, hammers and rods to dig through the solid rock, in order to permit cannon, soldiers and supplies to be moved from ground level to gun positions and observation points established in numerous places on the Upper Rock. Most of these supply routes were later widened to permit vehicular traffic. Many of the roads on the Upper Rock have steel rings embedded in the rock alongside the carriageway, which were used as safety brakes for heavy loads such as cannon being pulled up the slope. Some routes were retained as footpaths to enable troop movements to be concealed behind the surrounding shrubbery, and to provide alternative routes to key points if a road was congested with a heavy load. Several of the paths can be combined into a strenuous circuit of around that takes about four hours to complete, providing broad views of the Gibraltar peninsula, the Strait of Gibraltar, Spain and the coast of Morocco. Devil's Gap Footpath Map of Devil's Gap Footpath Devil's Gap Footpath links Gibraltar's Upper Town to Devil's Gap Battery, one of the oldest artillery batteries on the peninsula. It offers views over the city, Gibraltar Harbour and Bay of Gibraltar. It takes its name from the rocky outcrop at the top of the path on which the battery stands, which was called Punta del Diablo (\\"Devil's Point\\") by the Spanish. At above sea level, the outcrop provided a strategic location on the escarpment above the town and therefore commanded a wide range over the Bay of Gibraltar, making it hard for any enemy movements to go unnoticed.Gibraltar Heritage Trust information display panel on site, June 2013 Although difficult to say for sure, it is thought that the path has been in existence since at least the early 18th century but definitely since the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83). Older maps of the area show paths leading from the town to the Upper Rock but none seem to follow the current route. Luis Bravo de Acu√±a's 1627 \\"Plan of Gibraltar\\" shows that the eastern limits of the town were well below the current level.1627 \\"Plan of Gibraltar\\" by Luis Bravo de Acu√±a The natural route from the town to the Upper Rock at the time would have been via Charles V Wall. The path commences at the eastern boundary of the Upper Town at the junction of Devil's Gap Road with Baca's Passage. It proceeds in a mostly southerly direction before reaching a flight of steps which link it to Green Lane, the road leading to Devil's Gap Battery. Although it was previously overgrown and in a poor condition, it was renovated in 2013 as part of the Upper Rock Management Plan to make it more accessible, in a similar way to the refurbishment previously carried out at Mediterranean Steps. As part of the refurbishment works, the path was widened by pruning overgrown trees and shrubs and the drains were unclogged to prevent the path from puddling after rains. Information display panels carrying historical information about the path and on the wildlife that can be found there, together with a picnic table and waste bins designed to keep out Gibraltar's Barbary macaques were also added along the path. The Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society and the Gibraltar Heritage Trust oversaw it to ensure the work was carried out in a sensitive manner. Douglas Path Map of Douglas' Path Douglas Path is a path that connects a series of military installations at the top of the Rock of Gibraltar. It leads from the top of Charles V Wall to Mount Misery, one of the peaks of the Rock, before proceeding southwards to end at Douglas Cave. The first section of the path climbs a steep set of steps before running along a knife-edge ridge. It has views over both sides of the Rock of Gibraltar. The sheer east face of the Rock and the Great Gibraltar Sand Dune, which covers a large part of the eastern slope, can readily be seen. The vista provides sweeping views over the Bay of Gibraltar to the west and the Mediterranean Sea to the east. The path was cut by convict labour to facilitate troop movements on the Upper Rock. Shortly after setting off from the north end of the path, an old circular stone building is reached. Its construction has traditionally been attributed to the period of the Moorish occupation of Gibraltar (between 711‚Äì1462). In fact, it is much more likely to be an early British structureGuide to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, p. 5 which appears to have been built using stone recycled from an earlier building. It is nonetheless one of the oldest surviving structures at the top of the Rock. A short distance past the old observation post is a World War II structure, the Fortress Commander's Command Post. The path then descends to meet O'Hara's Road, which leads to O'Hara's Battery. Inglis Way Map of Inglis Way Inglis Way is a footpath with a length of around that traverses the middle section of the Upper Rock, linking various disused observation posts and emplacements. The origins of its name are uncertain; it may have been named after a person named Inglis, or it may have derived from an old Spanish name, el Camino del ingles, \\"the Englishman's Path\\".Guide to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, p. 22 It is the second longest path in the nature reserve after the Mediterranean Steps. The path, which takes about two hours to walk, starts at Queen's Gate in the Charles V WallGuide to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, p. 20 ‚Äì one of Gibraltar's oldest surviving fortifications, constructed in 1540. After proceeding through a breach in the Moorish Wall, the main section of the path passes under the cables of the Gibraltar Cable Car before passing a series of abandoned World War II observation posts and searchlight emplacements. A section of the path that proceeds through a firebreak at Bruce's Farm has views over the northern end of Gibraltar and across the Bay towards Algeciras. The area of the Rock through which the path passes is one of the richest in Gibraltar for flora and fauna. The start of the path is relatively sparsely vegetated and includes species such as White Asparagus, Common Asphodel, Germander and Esparto Grass. Its later sections proceed through dense vegetation that is typical of Mediterranean maquis shrubland ‚Äì a widespread biome in southern Europe that consists of densely growing evergreen shrubs adapted to resist droughts. The trees along the path are predominantly olives. These have all grown since the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779‚Äì83) when the Upper Rock's original woodland was felled by the British garrison to serve as fuel. It is thought that the present arboreal flora of Gibraltar is the result of seeds being brought onto the Rock by birds.Guide to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, p. 8 The maquis flora includes dense knots of creepers such as smilax, December clematis, pipe fine and black bryony, while ferns such as southern polypody and the rusty-back fern exploit the shade provided by the canopy. Many species of aromatic herbs and flowers also grow alongside the path, including purple Jerusalem sage and bee orchids. The fauna includes various species of birds that are adapted to life in the maquis, including the Sardinian warbler, wren and woodcock. Barbary partridges can be seen in the more open areas adjoining the path. Europe's largest lizard, the ocellated lizard, also lives in the vicinity, along with Iberian wall lizard, Algerian sand racer and Moorish gecko.Guide to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, p. 21 Mediterranean Steps The Mediterranean Steps are one of Gibraltar's more strenuous paths, descending from O'Hara's Battery near the Rock's summit to Jews' Gate at the southern foot of the Rock. They consist of a rock-cut staircase \\"which winds and bends and twists around precipice after precipice, and from point to point, with the Rock above and the blue expanse of the Mediterranean below.\\" They were constructed as part of the military communications system built by the British to allow access to their various installations at the southern end of the Rock. Royal Anglian Way Map of Royal Anglian Way. A ‚Äì eastern entry/exit point; B ‚Äì Rooke Battery; C ‚Äì military buildings; D ‚Äì Hayne's Cave Battery; E ‚Äì western entry/exit point Royal Anglian Way is a path that begins near Apes' Den, where there is a feeding station for the Barbary macaques in Gibraltar, and runs a distance of to a point near St. Michael's Cave. The feeding of the \\"apes\\" takes place twice a day in the early morning and late evening. They live in a number of troops with defined territories on the Rock; the Anglian Way Macaque Group has its feeding area at Apes' Den and the entirety of the path is within the troop's territory.Guide to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, p. 18 The macaques can be observed from the path dwelling in their natural habitat, away from the tourists who gather at Apes' Den to see the feedings. Much of the path was already in existence in the early 20th century to provide access to a number of gun batteries and other military installations. It takes its name from the Royal Anglian Regiment of the British Army, whose 2nd Battalion refurbished the path in 1968‚Äì69 and still maintains it with help from the Gibraltar Regiment.Cano, p. 124 From its western starting point at Old Queen's Road, at a height of above sea level, Royal Anglian Way runs along the western slope of the Rock past a number of abandoned military installations. It first passes Hayne's Cave Battery, a gun position established in 1797. One of the artillery pieces installed there in the 20th century is still present. Several former military support buildings are located further along the path, including kitchens with elongated ceramic chimneys. A little further along is Rooke Battery, built in 1907 and last used during World War II to mount a searchlight for illuminating the bay and to house the Fire Command Headquarters. The remains of the searchlight mounting can still be seen. The area around the path has been heavily shaped by human activity, leading to its colonisation by nitrophilous plants which benefit from nitrate-rich environments created by human interference. Flora and fauna that can be seen along the path include esparto grass, wild gladiolus, toothed lavender, rough bugloss and felty and shrubby germander, which grow in the area. Barbary partridge, northern raven and common kestrels nest near the path.Guide to the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, pp. 16‚Äì17 A less welcome presence is that of a number of feral goats which have caused serious damage to the vegetation, although eradication efforts are being pursued.

It is the story of a bookkeeper in need of money who agrees against his own better judgment to help a wealthy man carry out an elaborate suicide plan. Plot Because the firm is bankrupt, bookkeeper Sam Wilson learns from his boss, Malcolm Jarvis, that he is losing his job. Jarvis then makes a strange proposition, saying he intends to commit suicide, but wants Sam to make it look like a murder, in order for wife Edna and son Sydney to inherit Jarvis's life insurance. Sam declines, but when he goes to see Jarvis and finds his dead body, he reluctantly goes along with the scheme. He finds an envelope with $10,000 that Jarvis has left behind for him, which he hides from Georgia, his wife. He disposes of the weapon as well, so Jarvis's fingerprints from the suicide won't be found. Lt. Webb of the police is suspicious of Jarvis's business partner, Timothy Hearne. In the meantime, Sam's conscience gets the better of him. When he goes to see Edna Jarvis to confess his role in her husband's death, Edna reveals she's the one who committed the murder, Jarvis having changed his mind about the fake suicide. Edna is about to kill Sam as well when Webb shows up in the nick of time. Cast * Martha Scott as Georgia Wilson * Jeffrey Lynn as Sam Wilson * Harry Morgan as Lt.

McTay Murder, She Wrote In 1987, the television series Murder, She Wrote broadcast an episode that served as a sequel to Strange Bargain. This discounted the original ending of the film, instead seeing Jessica Fletcher being recruited to attempt to prove Sam Wilson's innocence following his 30 year prison sentence. The episode, ‚ÄúThe Days Dwindle Down‚Äù, saw the stars of the film, Martha Scott, Jeffrey Lynn and Harry Morgan, reprising their original roles. Reception =Critical response= A.H. Weiler, the film critic for the New York Times penned a fairly positive review. He wrote, \\"As a modest entry from Hollywood, Strange Bargain, which began a stand yesterday as the associate attraction to the Palace's vaudeville bill, is surprisingly diverting fare. Obviously not intended to set a cinematic landmark, it is, nevertheless, a melodrama that presents an extraordinary situation fairly suspensefully and, for the most part, through intelligent dialogue and direction. And, while it follows a familiar outline as a crime and punishment adventure, it does so neatly and with competent characterizations.\\"Weiler, A.H.

It was designed by George Pace, and built to house the cathedral bells. These had been hung in the cathedral's central tower, and needed overhaul, but it was considered to be unsafe to re- hang them in the tower without disturbing its architectural features. Despite the design resulting in some local controversy, the tower is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It is the first free-standing bell tower to be built by an English cathedral since the 15th century. History Towards the end of 1963, it was found that the bells of the cathedral, which were hung in the central tower, needed an overhaul, and ringing was suspended. In 1965, George Pace, the architect to York Minster, was commissioned to prepare a report. He recommended that the bells be recast and hung in a new bell frame. The installation and appropriate hanging of the bells presented several difficulties: access to the tower was difficult, the installation was potentially expensive and the new frame could not be installed in an ideal manner without obscuring the upper arches and galleries at the crossing, which were considered important architectural features. Pace recommended that consideration should be given to the building of a separate bell tower in the southeast corner of the churchyard. The recommendation was accepted by the Dean and Chapter in 1968, and Pace was commissioned to design the tower. The design was shown at the 1969 Royal Academy summer exhibition. The tower was named after the dean, Revd G. W. O. Addleshaw. The foundation stone of the new tower was laid on 16 June 1973 by Lord Leverhulme, Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire. The engineer for the project was Ove Arup and Partners, and the builders were A. Monk and Company, and Frankipile Limited. Pile foundations were necessary because the tower was built on the site of an old burial ground, and the sandstone bedrock was near the surface. Nine of the bells in the central tower of the cathedral were removed in February 1968 and were recast by John Taylor and Company of Loughborough into a ring of twelve bells and a flat sixth. Two bells were left in the cathedral tower, one cast by Henry Oldfield in 1606, and one cast by William Clibury in 1626. The bells were installed in the new tower towards the end of 1974, with the first trial ring on 23 October 1974. The bells were rung for a wedding for the first time on 26 February 1975, the bride being a member of the Grosvenor family. The tower was formally opened on 25 June 1975, by the Duke of Gloucester. For the occasion, each bell was rung separately by a ringer from one of thirteen different towers in the Chester area. The ceremonies concluded with a peal of Kent Treble Bob Maximus. The ringing chamber of the tower was refurbished in 2008. The tower is the headquarters of the Chester Diocesan Guild of Church Bell Ringers. Architecture The Addleshaw Tower is the first free-standing bell tower to be built by an English cathedral since the 15th century. It has a square plan and is high. The tower is built on a reinforced concrete frame. The base is faced in local pink sandstone, and contains an entrance on the southwest side, with windows on the other three sides. One window on each side contains Dalle de verre stained glass, and these are flanked by smaller pairs of windows. The entrance is deeply recessed and contains two pairs of timber doors. The upper parts of the tower are faced in Bethesda slates on a timber frame. Above the base are two stages with internally inclined walls, the upper stage being taller than the lower stage. Around the top of the lower stage is a ring of small, square windows. At the top of the upper stage is a ring of small louvred bell openings. On the summit of the tower is a pyramidal roof, which is also covered in slates. The base contains a meeting room, a small kitchen, and toilets. A spiral staircase leads up to the ringing chamber, where the bell ropes are arranged in a circle. On the walls of the chamber are tablets commemorating peals previously rung by the guild. Above the ringing chamber is the sound chamber and, at the top, the belfry. Appraisal When first built, the appearance of the tower was controversial, being known locally as the \\"Chester Rocket\\". The authors of the Buildings of England series describe it as being \\"uncompromisingly Modernist\\". The tower was designated as a Grade II listed building on 9 July 2012. The reasons given for its designation include its architectural interest, including the use of both traditionalism and modernism, and the use of traditional and modern materials; its design aesthetic, respecting its historic setting but also creating something modern; and the fact that it was designed by a notable 20th-century ecclesiastical architect. The reasons also note that it was Pace's last major work before his death.

Japan has an embassy in Koror while Palau has an embassy in Tokyo. History Koror under Japanese administration The bilateral ties between the two countries originated in 1920, when Japan assumed control over the island colonies of the German colonial empire in the Pacific which included present- day Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Marianas and Palau. The islands became part of the South Seas Mandate under the League of Nations and Koror was designated as the administrative center of the mandate. Under Japanese rule, Palau experienced significant development of its fishing, agriculture and mining industry. Palau achieved self-sufficiency to some degree during the period. Palau also served as a Japanese military base during World War II. Japanese administration over the islands ended following the defeat of Japan in the World War II. The South Seas Mandate became the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and it was administrated by the United States. Japan recognized the independence of Palau from the United States on 1 October 1994 and established formal relations with Palau during the same year on November 2. The Japanese embassy in Koror opened in 1999. Cultural relations As a former Japanese colony, Palau was influenced by Japanese culture. Contemporary Palauan has many words derived from Japanese such as \\"daijobu\\", \\"okyaku\\", \\"denki\\" and \\"senkyo\\". Local cuisine has also been influenced by the Japanese. Economic relations Japan-Palau Friendship Bridge Palau-based tuna shipping companies mainly export sashimi grade tuna to Japan. Licensing of fishing vessels from Japan remains a source of foreign exchange between Palau and Japan. Palau has supported Japan's whaling rights in the past but has since abandoned its support in June 2010 in favor of catch quota proposal being considered by the International Whaling Commission. Johnson Toribiong asserted that his country's policy change won't affect Japan‚ÄìPalau relations and claimed that Japan is \\"mature enough\\" to accept Palau's stand on whaling.

It is a sub-field of fluid and gas dynamics, and the term \\"aerodynamics\\" is often used when referring to fluid dynamics Early records of fundamental aerodynamics concepts date back to the work of Aristotle and Archimedes in the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC, but efforts to develop a quantitative theory of air flow did not begin until the 18th century. In 1726, Isaac Newton became one of the first aerodynamicists in the modern sense when he developed a theory of air resistance, which was later verified for low flow speeds. Air resistance experiments were performed by investigators throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, aided by the construction of the first wind tunnel in 1871. In his 1738 publication Hydrodynamica, Daniel Bernoulli described a fundamental relationship between pressure, velocity, and density, now termed Bernoulli's principle, which provides one method of calculating lift. Aerodynamics work throughout the 19th century sought to achieve heavier-than-air flight. George Cayley developed the concept of the modern fixed-wing aircraft in 1799, and in doing so identified the four fundamental forces of flight - lift, thrust, drag, and weight. The development of reasonable predictions of the thrust needed to power flight in conjunction with the development of high-lift, low- drag airfoils paved the way for the first powered flight. On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright flew the first successful powered aircraft. The flight, and the publicity it received, led to more organized collaboration between aviators and aerodynamicists, leading the way to modern aerodynamics. Theoretical advances in aerodynamics were made parallel to practical ones. The relationship described by Bernoulli was found to be valid only for incompressible, inviscid flow. In 1757, Leonhard Euler published the Euler equations, extending Bernoulli's principle to the compressible flow regime. In the early 19th century, the development of the Navier-Stokes equations extended the Euler equations to account for viscous effects. During the time of the first flights, several investigators developed independent theories connecting flow circulation to lift. Ludwig Prandtl became one of the first people to investigate boundary layers during this time. Early aerodynamic thought - antiquity to the 19th century A drawing of a design for a flying machine by Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1488). This machine was an ornithopter, with flapping wings similar to those of a bird, first presented in his Codex on the Flight of Birds in 1505. =Theoretical foundations= Although the modern theory of aerodynamic science did not emerge until the 18th century, its foundations began to emerge in ancient times. The fundamental aerodynamics continuity assumption has its origins in Aristotle's Treatise on the Heavens, although Archimedes, working in the 3rd century BC, was the first person to formally assert that a fluid could be treated as a continuum. Archimedes also introduced the concept that fluid flow was driven by a pressure gradient within the fluid. This idea would later prove fundamental to the understanding of fluid flow. In 1687, Newton's Principia presented Newton's laws of motion, the first complete theoretical approach to understanding mechanical phenomena. In particular, Newton's second law, a statement of the conservation of momentum, is one of three fundamental physical principles used to obtain the Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations. In 1738, the Dutch-Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica, in which he described the fundamental relationship between pressure and velocity, known today as Bernoulli's principle. This states that the pressure of a flowing fluid decreases as its velocity increases and as such was a significant early advance in the theory of fluid dynamics, and was first quantified in an equation derived by Leonhard Euler. This expression, often called Bernoulli's Equation, relates the pressure, density, and velocity at two points along a streamline within a flowing fluid as follows: :{v_1^2 \\\\over 2}+{p_1\\\\over\\\\rho} = {v_2^2 \\\\over 2}+{p_2\\\\over\\\\rho} Bernoulli's Equation ignores compressibility of the fluid, as well as the effects of gravity and viscous forces on the flow. Leonhard Euler would go on to publish the Euler equations in 1757, which are valid for both compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting in the Navier-Stokes equations. =Studies of air resistance= A drawing of a glider by Sir George Cayley, one of the early attempts at creating an aerodynamic shape. The retarding effect of air on a moving object was among the earliest aerodynamic phenomena to be explored. Aristotle wrote about air resistance in the 4th century BC, but lacked the understanding to quantify the resistance he observed. In fact, Aristotle paradoxically suggested that the movement of air around a thrown spear both resisted its motion and propelled it forward. In the 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci published the Codex Leicester, in which he rejected Aristotle's theory and attempted to prove that the only effect of air on a thrown object was to resist its motion, and that air resistance was proportional to flow speed, a false conclusion which was supported by Galileo's 17th century observations of pendulum motion decay. In addition to his work on drag, da Vinci was the first person to record a number of aerodynamic ideas including correctly describing the circulation of vortices and the continuity principle as applied to channel flow. The true quadratic dependency of drag on velocity was experimentally proven independently by Edme Mariotte and Christiaan Huygens, both members of the Paris Academy of Sciences, in the late 17th century. Sir Isaac Newton later became the first person to theoretically derive this quadratic dependence of air resistance in the early 18th century, making him one of the first theoretical aerodynamicists. Newton stated that drag was proportional to the dimensions of a body, the density of the fluid, and the square of the air velocity, a relationship which was demonstrated to be correct for low flow speeds, but stood in direct conflict with Galileo's earlier findings. The discrepancy between the work of Newton, Mariotte, and Huygens, and Galileo's earlier work was not resolved until advances in viscous flow theory in the 20th century. Newton also developed a law for the drag force on a flat plate inclined towards the direction of the fluid flow. Using F for the drag force, œÅ for the density, S for the area of the flat plate, V for the flow velocity, and Œ∏ for the angle of attack, his law was expressed as: :F = \\\\rho SV^2 \\\\sin^2 (\\\\theta) This equation overestimates drag in most cases, and was often used in the 19th century to argue the impossibility of human flight. At low inclination angles, drag depends linearly on the sin of the angle, not quadratically. However, Newton's flat plate drag law yields reasonable drag predictions for supersonic flows or very slender plates at large inclination angles which lead to flow separation. Air resistance experiments were carried out by investigators throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Drag theories were developed by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Gustav Kirchhoff, and Lord Rayleigh. Equations for fluid flow with friction were developed by Claude- Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes. To simulate fluid flow, many experiments involved immersing objects in streams of water or simply dropping them off the top of a tall building. Towards the end of this time period Gustave Eiffel used his Eiffel Tower to assist in the drop testing of flat plates. A more precise way to measure resistance is to place an object within an artificial, uniform stream of air where the velocity is known. The first person to experiment in this fashion was Francis Herbert Wenham, who in doing so constructed the first wind tunnel in 1871. Wenham was also a member of the first professional organization dedicated to aeronautics, the Royal Aeronautical Society of the United Kingdom. Objects placed in wind tunnel models are almost always smaller than in practice, so a method was needed to relate small scale models to their real-life counterparts. This was achieved with the invention of the dimensionless Reynolds number by Osborne Reynolds. Reynolds also experimented with laminar to turbulent flow transition in 1883. A replica of the Wright Brothers' wind tunnel is on display at the Virginia Air and Space Center. Wind tunnels were key in the development and validation of the laws of aerodynamics. Developments in aviation Working from at least as early as 1796, when he constructed a model helicopter,Wragg, D.W.; Flight before flying, Osprey, 1974, Page 57. until his death in 1857, Sir George Cayley is credited as the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight‚Äîweight, lift, drag, and thrust‚Äîand the relationships between them.Cayley, George. \\"On Aerial Navigation\\" Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy, 1809-1810. (Via NASA). Raw text. Retrieved: 30 May 2010. Cayley is also credited as the first person to develop the modern fixed-wing aircraft concept; although da Vinci's notes contain drawings and descriptions of a fixed-wing heavier-than-air flight machine, da Vinci's notes were disorganized and scattered following his death, and his aerodynamics achievements were not rediscovered until after technology had progressed well beyond da Vinci's advances. By the late 19th century, two problems were identified before heavier-than-air flight could be realized. The first was the creation of low-drag, high-lift aerodynamic wings. The second problem was how to determine the power needed for sustained flight. During this time, the groundwork was laid down for modern day fluid dynamics and aerodynamics, with other less scientifically-inclined enthusiasts testing various flying machines with little success. In 1884, John J. Montgomery, an American trained in physics, began experimenting with glider designs. Using a water table with circulating water and a smoke chamber he began applying the physics of fluid dynamics to describe the motions of flow over curved surfaces such as airfoils.Harwood, CS and Fogel, GB Quest for Flight: John J. Montgomery and the Dawn of Aviation in the West, University of Oklahoma Press, 2012. In 1889, Charles Renard, a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight. Renard and German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz explored the wing loading (weight to wing-area ratio) of birds, eventually concluding that humans could not fly under their own power by attaching wings onto their arms. Otto Lilienthal, following the work of Sir George Cayley, was the first person to become highly successful with glider flights. Lilienthal believed that thin, curved airfoils would produce high lift and low drag. Octave Chanute's 1893 book, Progress in Flying Machines, outlined all of the known research conducted around the world up to that point. Chanute's book provided a great service to those interested in aerodynamics and flying machines. With the information contained in Chanute's book, the personal assistance of Chanute himself, and research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the Wright brothers gained enough knowledge of aerodynamics to fly the first powered aircraft on December 17, 1903. The Wright brothers' flight confirmed or disproved a number of aerodynamics theories. Newton's drag force theory was finally proved incorrect. This first widely publicised flight led to a more organized effort between aviators and scientists, leading the way to modern aerodynamics. During the time of the first flights, John J. Montgomery,Harwood, CS and Fogel, GB Quest for Flight: John J. Montgomery and the Dawn of Aviation in the West University of Oklahoma Press, 2012. Frederick W. Lanchester, Martin Kutta, and Nikolai Zhukovsky independently created theories that connected circulation of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, Ludwig Prandtl is credited with developing the mathematics behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with boundary layers. Prandtl, a professor at the University of G√∂ttingen, instructed many students who would play important roles in the development of aerodynamics, such as Theodore von K√°rm√°n and Max Munk. Design issues with increasing speed Compressibility is an important factor in aerodynamics. At low speeds, the compressibility of air is not significant in relation to aircraft design, but as the airflow nears and exceeds the speed of sound, a host of new aerodynamic effects become important in the design of aircraft. These effects, often several of them at a time, made it very difficult for World War II era aircraft to reach speeds much beyond 800 km/h (500 mph). Some of the minor effects include changes to the airflow that lead to problems in control. For instance, the P-38 Lightning with its thick high-lift wing had a particular problem in high-speed dives that led to a nose-down condition. Pilots would enter dives, and then find that they could no longer control the plane, which continued to nose over until it crashed. The problem was remedied by adding a \\"dive flap\\" beneath the wing which altered the center of pressure distribution so that the wing would not lose its lift. A similar problem affected some models of the Supermarine Spitfire. At high speeds, the ailerons could apply more torque than the Spitfire's thin wings could handle, and the entire wing would twist in the opposite direction. This meant that the plane would roll in the direction opposite to that which the pilot intended, and led to a number of accidents. Earlier models weren't fast enough for this to be a problem, and so it wasn't noticed until later model Spitfires like the Mk.IX started to appear. This was mitigated by adding considerable torsional rigidity to the wings, and was wholly cured when the Mk.XIV was introduced. The Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Mitsubishi Zero had the exact opposite problem in which the controls became ineffective. At higher speeds, the pilot simply couldn't move the controls because there was too much airflow over the control surfaces. The planes would become difficult to maneuver, and at high enough speeds aircraft without this problem could out-turn them. These problems were eventually solved as jet aircraft reached transonic and supersonic speeds. German scientists in WWII experimented with swept wings. Their research was applied on the MiG-15 and F-86 Sabre and bombers such as the B-47 Stratojet used swept wings which delay the onset of shock waves and reduce drag. In order to maintain control near and above the speed of sound, it is often necessary to use either power operated all-flying tailplanes (stabilators), or delta wings fitted with power operated elevons. Power operation prevents aerodynamic forces overriding the pilots' control inputs. Finally, another common problem that fits into this category is flutter. At some speeds, the airflow over the control surfaces will become turbulent, and the controls will start to flutter. If the speed of the fluttering is close to a harmonic of the control's movement, the resonance could break the control off completely. This was a serious problem on the Zero and VL Myrsky. When problems with poor control at high speed were first encountered, they were addressed by designing a new style of control surface with more power. However, this introduced a new resonant mode, and a number of planes were lost before this was discovered. On design of VL Myrsky, this problem was countered by increasing the rigidity and weight of the wing, therefore increasing the dampening of the harmonic oscillation, which compromised the performance to some extent. All of these effects are often mentioned in conjunction with the term \\"compressibility\\", but in a manner of speaking, they are incorrectly used. From a strictly aerodynamic point of view, the term should refer only to those side-effects arising as a result of the changes in airflow from an incompressible fluid (similar in effect to water) to a compressible fluid (acting as a gas) as the speed of sound is approached. There are two effects in particular, wave drag and critical mach. Wave drag is a sudden rise in drag on the aircraft, caused by air building up in front of it. At lower speeds, this air has time to \\"get out of the way\\", guided by the air in front of it that is in contact with the aircraft. But at the speed of sound, this can no longer happen, and the air which was previously following the streamline around the aircraft now hits it directly. The amount of power needed to overcome this effect is considerable. The critical mach is the speed at which some of the air passing over the aircraft's wing becomes supersonic. At the speed of sound, the way that lift is generated changes dramatically, from being dominated by Bernoulli's principle to forces generated by shock waves. Since the air on the top of the wing is traveling faster than on the bottom, due to Bernoulli effect, at speeds close to the speed of sound the air on the top of the wing will be accelerated to supersonic. When this happens, the distribution of lift changes dramatically, typically causing a powerful nose-down trim. Since the aircraft normally approached these speeds only in a dive, pilots would report the aircraft attempting to nose over into the ground. Dissociation absorbs a great deal of energy in a reversible process. This greatly reduces the thermodynamic temperature of hypersonic gas decelerated near an aerospace vehicle. In transition regions, where this pressure dependent dissociation is incomplete, both the differential, constant pressure heat capacity and beta (the volume/pressure differential ratio) will greatly increase. The latter has a pronounced effect on vehicle aerodynamics including stability. Faster than sound ‚Äì later 20th century As aircraft began to travel faster, aerodynamicists realized that the density of air began to change as it came into contact with an object, leading to a division of fluid flow into the incompressible and compressible regimes. In compressible aerodynamics, density and pressure both change, which is the basis for calculating the speed of sound. Newton was the first to develop a mathematical model for calculating the speed of sound, but it was not correct until Pierre-Simon Laplace accounted for the molecular behavior of gases and introduced the heat capacity ratio. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach, who was one of the first to investigate the properties of supersonic flow which included Schlieren photography techniques to visualize the changes in density. William John Macquorn Rankine and Pierre Henri Hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a shock wave. Jakob Ackeret led the initial work on calculating the lift and drag on a supersonic airfoil. Theodore von K√°rm√°n and Hugh Latimer Dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. Because of the increase in drag approaching Mach 1, aerodynamicists and aviators disagreed on whether supersonic flight was achievable. Image showing shock waves from NASA's X-43A hypersonic research vehicle in flight at Mach 7, generated using a computational fluid dynamics algorithm. On September 30, 1935, an exclusive conference was held in Rome with the topic of high velocity flight and the possibility of breaking the sound barrier. Participants included Theodore von K√°rm√°n, Ludwig Prandtl, Jakob Ackeret, Eastman Jacobs, Adolf Busemann, Geoffrey Ingram Taylor, Gaetano Arturo Crocco, and Enrico Pistolesi. Ackeret presented a design for a supersonic wind tunnel. Busemann gave a presentation on the need for aircraft with swept wings for high speed flight. Eastman Jacobs, working for NACA, presented his optimized airfoils for high subsonic speeds which led to some of the high performance American aircraft during World War II. Supersonic propulsion was also discussed. The sound barrier was broken using the Bell X-1 aircraft twelve years later, thanks in part to those individuals. By the time the sound barrier was broken, much of the subsonic and low supersonic aerodynamics knowledge had matured. The Cold War fueled an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. Computational fluid dynamics was started as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using a computer, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions. With some exceptions, the knowledge of hypersonic aerodynamics has matured between the 1960s and the present decade. Therefore, the goals of an aerodynamicist have shifted from understanding the behavior of fluid flow to understanding how to engineer a vehicle to interact appropriately with the fluid flow. For example, while the behavior of hypersonic flow is understood, building a scramjet aircraft to fly at hypersonic speeds has seen very limited success. Along with building a successful scramjet aircraft, the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems will continue to fuel new research in aerodynamics. Nevertheless, there are still important problems in basic aerodynamic theory, such as in predicting transition to turbulence, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.

State aid is typically divided among all libraries in a state in the form of block grants. Each eligible library receives a percentage of state aid based on the library's budget, income and population served. State aid supplements local library budgets, and is particularly important for rural libraries and libraries supported by a small tax base. Other reasons states offer aid to libraries are to promote resource sharing among libraries; to encourage cities to establish and support libraries; and to establish minimum standards for libraries. State aid is combined with other forms of library funding‚Äîincluding federal aid, funding by local governments and private philanthropy‚Äîto provide money for library books, staff and information technology. Other forms of aid may be used to fund library construction and remodeling. In order to qualify for federal assistance for libraries, states must provide a certain level of state aid. This is called \\"maintenance of effort.\\" For example, in order to maintain access to federal technology grants, Florida must provide its libraries with at least $21.2 million a year in state aid. State funding must be re-authorized every year by state legislatures. Most states offer aid to libraries. However, state aid has recently become more politically contentious. Critics of state funding argue that local libraries should be funded with local money. In 2012, the state of Louisiana eliminated state aid. In a statement, the governor‚Äôs chief budget aide said that ‚Äúin tight budget times, we prioritized funding for health care and education.

Unfortunately, Shanin did not pass the audition of Idola Cilik in 2008, necessary to making the first step in pursuing a career even though he was eliminated in the top 10 of Idola Cilik Season One. =Blink and Putih Abu-Abu= After completing a three-year contract with her old management, Shilla was offered the chance to join My Stars Management who were in the early stages of forming a music group (which was eventually named Blink). Shilla joined, and then Blink was born with five members on July 23, 2011. Shilla starred in the soap opera White Gray and Special Concert White Grey, along with taking part in a duet with Last Child (band). Blink also lined up to read nominations on the mat SCTV Music Awards 2012. Not long after, rumours about the release of Shilla, and the folding of Blink started, from May 2012. This rumour was finally answered on July 5, 2012 through soap opera White Gray. Shilla had actually officially resigned from Blink at the beginning of June 2012 when Blink began using StarSeven Management. This was confirmed July 2012, ending growing speculation on various online news sites. Shilla joined StarSeven Management to further her career in June 2012. =Solo career= Following splitting from Blink, Shilla went back to using her old stage name Zee Ashilla or Ashilla Zee (Zee from Zahrantiara).

He may be credited with the leadership which brought changes in the practice of psychiatry after World War II and in advocating the treatment for people with mental disorders. Blain was born in China to missionary parents. His mother tutored him at home until he was 11 years old and was sent to boarding school in Shanghai. At age 13, he came to the United States to continue his education and worked through high school and college. He obtained his undergraduate degree from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. He left the university after his second year to teach at Hangchow College in China. He attended the University of Chicago for pre-medicine studies then entered the medical school at Vanderbilt University. He received his M.D. in 1929. He interned at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and then trained at the Boston City Hospital. His residency in psychiatry was completed at the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In 1941, he opened his private psychiatric practice in New York City. In 1972, he was awarded an LLD degree by La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and an honorary Sc.D. from Washington and Lee University. With the start of World War II, Blain was commissioned into the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), and was the medical director for the War Shipping Administration (WSA). Through the WSA, Blain directed the provision of medical care for casualties in the Merchant Marine Service. When the war ended, he was recommended to lead the Psychiatric and Neurologic Division in the Department of Medicine and Surgery in the Veterans Administration (VA) to provide care for World War II veterans. Blain was instrumental in providing psychiatric and neurologic care to thousands of veterans who were rehabilitating in inadequate VA hospital facilities and VA outpatient clinics which had inadequate numbers of trained medical staff. Blain forged relationships between the newly organized National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) of the USPHS, and with medical schools and universities. The new relationships between the VA hospitals and clinics established training programs in psychiatry, neurology, psychology, social work, and psychiatric nursing which led to the infusion of trained professional medical staff. Blain reorganized the Psychiatric and Neurologic Division's central office by adding trained staff who were responsible for the patients. Blain was in the VA post for two years (1946‚Äì1948) when the American Psychiatric Association (APA) reorganized, and established the position of medical director. The APA offered the position to Blain. He accepted and was the medical director for ten years. He also served as the chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Georgetown University Hospital from 1947 to 1948. One of Blain's first undertakings was moving the APA's main office from New York City to Washington, D.C., and to adequately staff the office. Since most psychiatrists were stationed in state mental hospitals and a small number of private mental hospitals, Blain began to visit the state hospitals to establish channels of communication with the APA membership. He began a four- page newsletter. He was appalled at the inhumane conditions he found at some state hospitals, which led to calling a meeting of hospital superintendents to exchange information and suggest improvements in patient care. Thus, the first Mental Hospital Institute was organized in 1949 and continues to meet annually. The Mental Hospital Institute Proceedings were published and led to the journal Mental Hospitals. After ten years as the APA Medical Director, Blain resigned in the 1950s. He spent a year as the director of Mental Health and Research and Training of the Interstate Commission of Higher Education. He then moved to California to serve as the Commissioner of Mental Health from 1959 to 1963. He retired to the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, a private mental hospital in Philadelphia where he served as director of the community psychiatric program. He was named Emeritus Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He also worked with the United Auto Workers to help organize the financing of mental health programs for the unionized auto workers. From 1966 to 1970, Blain was the superintendent of Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry which had a long history of custodial care. Blain was involved in numerous professional activities. He was a consultant to the Alaska Health Department, which was establishing the state's first mental hospital. Blain reportedly visited over 500 mental hospitals during his career. In 1975, the Salmon Committee of the New York Academy of Medicine awarded him its Distinguished Service Medal. He served as chairman of the Psychiatry Department at Georgetown Medical School from 1946 to 1948. Blain was a member of numerous professional organizations including the APA (president, 1964‚Äì1965), the American College of Psychiatrists, the American Psychoanalytic Association, the American Association of Mental Deficiency, the Canadian Psychiatric Association, the Australian College of Psychiatrists, and the Royal College of Psychiatry.

He established a medical school in Manchester and was an honorary surgeon of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, as well as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.  Early life  Joseph Jordan was descended from Dutch immigrants who had emigrated to England in the 14th century. His grandfather was William Jordan, a printer of linen and cotton who had established himself in Manchester in 1745 and whose son, also called William, had six children from his marriage to Mary Moors. Joseph was born on 3 March 1787 as the youngest of the four sons. Jordan was a diligent but wayward child at school and was expelled when he damaged its clock while investigating the mechanism. He was apprenticed at the age of 15 to a surgeon at what was then known as the Public Infirmary of Manchester (since 1830, the Manchester Royal Infirmary), transferring his tutelage to another surgeon at that hospital when he tired of being used as a lackey. He moved to Edinburgh when he was 19 and there he continued his medical education under the guidance of Alexander Munro and Charles Bell. Having qualified in medicine at Edinburgh, Jordan enrolled in the 1st Battalion, Royal Lancashire Regiment on 12 December 1806. The Napoleonic Wars were then occurring and in April of the following year Jordan was promoted from the rank of Ensign to Assistant Surgeon. He did not see active service during his time in the army, although he was based at various locations around England and Scotland and did at one point have medical responsibility for some French prisoners. He found his military experience to be unsatisfying and supplemented his income with occasional private medical work, as well as continuing to study aspects of medicine and, in particular, anatomy. Achieving no further promotion, he resigned his commission and in 1811 went to London to further his studies.  School of Anatomy  Jordan returned to Manchester in 1812 and for the next two years was a junior partner in the medical practice of Stewart and Bancks. He left that and in September 1814 advertised that he would be offering lectures in anatomy from a building in Bridge Street. He had been combining practice work with lectures since 1812 and his new venture moved to larger premises on Bridge Street in 1816. According to medical historian E. M. Brockbank, his first premises had been at 4 Bridge Street, he subsequently moved to 70 Bridge Street and then expanded to include number 68, next door, and the top floor of number 66; other sources differ in the precise locations. The new school was a challenge to the medical establishment. Jordan hoped to reduce the burden of costs that were placed on students who otherwise would have to go to London if they wanted to obtain a diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons or a licence from the London Society of Apothecaries (LSA). As a side-effect of this, he thought that student morals would not be subjected to the licentiousness that he perceived to be present in London and that a provincial education would increase the number of doctors practicing outside the capital. He arranged that his curriculum would comply with the requirements of the London institutions and thus it comprised a seven-month course of 140 lectures as well as lessons and demonstrations in dissection. He offered a formal, structured programme of study of a type unavailable outside the capital and the few universities that then existed, and he offered an alternative to the more commonly adopted process of medical learning that involved a long apprenticeship to an apothecary, physician or surgeon during which the student was exposed to ad hoc teaching based on presented cases but little or no theoretical teaching. In 1817, his school became the first provincial institution to be recognised by the Society of Apothecaries as a teaching establishment for those seeking its licentiate. The standards at this time had been regulated by the Apothecaries Act of 1815 but a tightening of the requirements in 1817 caused him to be de-listed. Recognition returned in 1821, when the Royal College of Surgeons of England also accepted his school as a suitable provider of education for its MRCS diploma. He occasionally got into trouble both with the law and the general public due to his use of body- snatchers and even the direct involvement of himself and students in the surreptitious procurement of suitable corpses for study. There had been an incident concerning the uncertain provenance of a corpse that he had used for dissection as far back as his army days, when he was stationed in Kidderminster. By now, Jordan had become an important member of Manchester's medical community and he was the driving force behind the establishment of the Manchester and Salford Lock Hospital in 1819. His School of Anatomy had broadened the scope of its courses since foundation but it was not as comprehensive in coverage as the Pine Street Medical School opened by Thomas Turner in 1824. Turner's school offered all of the courses demanded for the LSA and MRCS qualifications, rather than a subset of them. Turner was able to call upon the support of previously cultivated contacts, including John Dalton and other members of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and these people in turn attracted other luminaries. He is credited with \\"creating the first more or less complete provincial medical school in England\\". In 1826 Jordan responded to Turner's challenge, which was creating intense competition both for students and staff, by moving his medical school to purpose-built premises in Mount Street. He now had facilities that were superior in size and equipment to those of Turner, and that included private dissecting rooms for use by qualified doctors. However, the attempt to recover lost ground was unsuccessful, in part because Jordan was not an easy person to work with and perhaps also because of objections to the introduction of his young nephew, Edward Stephens, as an instructor. In 1828, his staff deserted him to establish their own school on Marsden Street. Thereafter, the combined efforts of Jordan and Stephens could not match the range of courses offered by the Pine Street school, which had both more and better-quality staff. Jordan was now torn between his school business and his desire to be elected to an honorary surgeon's position at the Manchester Infirmary. He failed in an election of 1828 and again in 1833; among those opposing him were his former staff. Competition for the posts was tough and required influence with, and influencing of, both existing staff and people who subscribed the funds that financed the infirmary's work. Jordan determined to spend a lot of money in the next elections and to have the public support of Turner, who had been elected in 1830, and his contacts. Jordan was successful in this effort, which arose upon the death of another surgeon in 1835, but it cost him, among other things, his Mount Street school. The school was closed and its students and library were transferred to Pine Street in 1834 as the price for Turner's future support.  Later life  Jordan was a bachelor. He was among the Founder Members of the Chetham Society and was Vice-President of the Manchester Royal Institution in 1857. In 1869, he was appointed as consulting surgeon-extraordinary to Salford Royal Hospital. He continued to live at his Bridge Street residence until 1871, at which time he began to suffer from very poor health. He moved to West High Street in Salford and then to Stroud in Gloucestershire before living at South Hill Park in Hampstead, London, where he died on 31 March 1873. In 1900, a Dr. Renaud presented a portrait of Jordan to the Board of the Manchester Royal Infirmary.

During his career, he served in World War One, commanded Company K of the 372nd Infantry Regiment ultimately rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was President of the West Medford Men's Community Club and Chair of the Citizen's Committee bringing Boy Scouts Troop No. 11 to the area. Dugger was the first African American to be appointed to the Medford City Planning Board and to have a Medford public park named after him, \\"Dugger Park.\\" Dugger died in 1939.  Early life and education  Dugger Park Sign Medford Massachusetts USA The youngest of 8 children, Dugger was born in Finchley, Virginia, on June 6, 1894, to William (a former slave) and Mary Jane Hepburn Dugger. As a young boy he moved with his family to Natick, Massachusetts, where he received his elementary education and was a member of the Boys' Patrol. Dugger's family eventually moved to Boston and he attended Boston English High. During his high school years, he was a track star and a member of his school's military regiment. Upon graduation in 1914, Dugger signed up for the National Guard and later enlisted in the famous Company L of the 6th Massachusetts Infantry. He was commissioned first lieutenant on October 14, 1917 at Fort Des Moines, and weeks later married a West Medford native, Madeline Mabray Kountze.  Military career  In June 1918, Dugger began his duty overseas. The British had been training American soldiers as they arrived but refused to train the 92nd and 93rd Divisions. To avoid trouble, the United States turned these men over to the French Army, who had been requesting extra troops. In addition to racism, the men faced the many maladies of war. Dugger's son, Cortland, recounts: \\"They slept in the trenches... Everything they did ‚Äî they ate, they did, they fought in the trenches... in rain, sleet, whatever else, cold weather. It was an awful war... You know they were gassed, their clothing wasn't adequate, they had a whole host of diseases over the place.\\"Ilsa Dohmen interviewing Cortland Dugger, February 2006.  Local service  Dugger won distinction for bravery and returned home in March 1919. He joined the Boston Police Force and later the Postal Service, where he worked until his retirement fifteen years later. Edward and Madeline had six children between 1919 and 1930, and had a house built on Jerome Street in West Medford for their big family. During this time period, Dugger had been commissioned a Major and made Captain of Company K of the 372nd Infantry Regiment. He became the commanding officer in December 1930 and devoted much of his energy to the unit until his retirement in 1936. At home and in the community, Dugger served as a model of duty and leadership. He was President of the West Medford Men's Community Club and Chair of the Citizen's Committee that brought Boy Scouts Troop No. 11 to the area. In 1936, he was appointed the first black member of the Medford City Planning Board by Mayor Irwin. However he would serve for only two years due to illness.  Illness and death  Between 1936 and 1938, Dugger retired from all these positions. He had been sick with polycystic kidneys for many years and found his health failing. On March 5, 1939, Dugger died in the U.S. Naval Hospital Chelsea, Massachusetts, at the age of 44.  Dugger Park dedication and remembrance  Later in 1939, for the first time in its history, the City of Medford honored an African American citizen in naming a public park after him. Called the \\"Dugger Park\\", the area along the Mystic River at Harvard Avenue has grown to include tennis and basketball courts, a baseball field, and a playground. Attorney Matthew Bullock remarked at the dedication that the park was \\"destined to be a large factor in moulding the lives of the children of this community.\\" And indeed it was. The park plays host to myriad community events and a sign post at the intersection of Harvard Avenue and Mystic River Road boasts graffiti letting passersby know that local children consider it: \\"The Action Plase [sic]\\" .

The story tells of John Constantine, an infamous English occult detective and con man, during one of his travels in the backbone of the United States. Where he gets entangled in a salon while seeking shelter from a strong blizzard. Eventually leading to murder and a revelation of a local urban myth. One of the most well known run of the series, author Brian Azzarello was nominated for an Eisner Award together with his other influential work, 100 Bullets. The story is notable for bringing back the series trademark horror roots, while bringing themes such as social distrust, suspenseful myth, mystery, and murder. Plot Taking place in the snowy backwoods of the American country, a powerful snow storm has hit the local area, making the highways and roads completely inaccessible due to heavy snowfall and blizzard. Many took shelter in a local salon run by Keith and his wife Hope. Among those were Jay together with his wife Marnie and their two young daughters, an old man named Rudy and his old wife Alma, Pete, a salon regular and a close friend of Keith, and an unnamed trucker. All of them were having a good time with each other's company until the arrival of John Constantine. Constantine's sudden appearance and generally unfriendly nature created some dislike of the patrons, but they nonetheless make him stay. Pete goes outs to throw rock salts out by the door, but notices a man with an icicle thrust in his chest inside a parked car. He informs the rest about it, and he and Keith drag the corpse inside, much to the horror of Jay's kids who saw it. They try to call the police but finds out that the phones were dead. Alma says that the murder was like that of the local \\"Ice Man\\" murder legends, which was a local serial killer myth. This created discomfort among the folks, and they started accusing the Englishman may have done it. Constantine rebuffs the accusation and assures them he knew nothing about it. He even volunteers himself to help out Pete examine the corpse outside. Rudy and Alma tell the others about the Ice Man legend which started in 1892. In the story, a Swede named Gunter Helgeson made a trip through a similar blizzard and finds a cabin with all of his colleagues dead and headless, their heads placed on icicles outside the camp. Gunter went missing the next day and was never found again. They say the Ice Man is said to kill during powerful snow storms, targeting those trapped in their own shelters. Three other men soon arrives in the salon, and were surprised to see the corpse, while Keith and the trucker carries it outside. One of them, Lamar, was actually shot in the torso, but they dismisses it as simply alcohol drinking. Constantine and Pete leave the saloon to check the now frozen corpse. The late arrivals went to the lavatory, and Rudy accidentally walks in and curses in surprise as he sees that one of them is bleeding heavily from a stomach wound. The three try to spin a story about a car crash but when Rudy spots a gun in the jacket of one of them, Waylon (the gunman) drops the act and pulls his gun on the old man. The second uninjured man, Dwight, warns Rudy that if he does not keep quiet about Lamar's injury, Waylon will have no problem with shooting him dead. Outside, John asks Pete if he has ever seen a dead man before. Pete says he has not and tries to assure Constantine that the Iceman is not a myth but a real creature. Pete recounts a tale from his childhood, where he played in a long winter similar to the raging snowstorm. While playing out with his sled, the snow suddenly started melting as winter's end approaches. A young Pete sees three snowmen melting off to reveal three gruesomely killed men hidden in each snowman. This experience haunted Pete for years he said. Back at the salon, Waylon mistaken Rudy of trying to warn the others and becomes hostile to them as he pulls out and fires his pistol. They later tell everyone that they were robbers and murderers and that they were now their hostages. Keith was later ordered to clean Lamar's worsening wound. Back outside, Constantine and Pete heard the gunshots, and both agreed to rush to the nearest police station on foot while the storm worsens. While doing so, Constantine started speculating of Pete's odd behavior about the Ice Man legend, and confronts Pete about it. In the salon, as everyone is kept shut, Waylon tries to rape Hope, but the woman managed to fight back. Keith pleaded them to leave her wife alone. A sudden knock on the front door distracts everyone. Waylon opens the door and sees a grinning Constantine in at gunpoint. John claims to be responsible for the murder of the man found with an icicle sticking from his chest. After hearing this, Jay urges Dwight to shoot Constantine. But a sneering Constantine bluffs Waylon, denouncing him an amateur killer before the lights suddenly go out, leaving the saloon in darkness. Dwight wonders if it was the other guy, Pete, who cut the power while Constantine distracts them, but Constantine suggests that the fault probably just rests with the weather. Waylon and Dwight decide to check outside for Pete, leaving Lamar to watch over their hostages. Constantine strikes up a conversation with the bleeding Lamar, and Constantine literally killed the gunman by talking him to death when Lamar got distracted and eventually loses large amounts of blood. Hope realizes that Constantine is not the Iceman and John again assures that the Iceman is just a myth. Jay later gets paranoid and grabs Lamar's gun and warns everyone with it. Waylon and Dwight return and a tense standoff ensues between the two gunmen and the armed Jay. Waylon points his gun at Jay's daughters and when the terrified father lowers his gun, Waylon shoots him. Keith sees this as an opportunity and attacks Waylon. Dwight tries to shoot him but was suddenly shot by Hope with a shotgun in the jaw, killing him. Waylon panics, and grabs Jay's youngest kid as a hostage before running back to the storm. Marnie tries to follow Waylon, but Constantine armed with a shotgun forbids her. Saying that she should leave it to the \\"legend\\" to save her daughter. Outside, Waylon tries to get inside his car, but an icicle is driven through his chest by Pete. The kid was returned safely, and everyone watches in horror as Pete builds a snowman out of Waylon's dead body. It was later revealed that John Constantine deduced that Pete was actually the Ice Man or was trying to be, and Constantine managed to manipulate him into killing as soon as he found out. John Constantine later leaves the salon and its patrons behind as he walks back into the snowstorm. Themes Like many of Brian Azzarello's stories, Freezes Over exemplifies the darker personality of the human psyche, where the characters are deeply flawed and social distrust came to them during the murder. Azzarello brings his signature blending of Noir and urban horror made famous by his other work 100 Bullets.Freezes Over graphic novel review The story is in the style of a suspenseful mystery containing elements of urban myth, home invasion and murder present. The story was notable for bringing back the comic's trademark graphic and psychological horror, but the supernatural theme that the series is well known for were absent or slightly omitted, focusing more on realistic horror. Critical reception UGO listed Hellblazer: Freezes Over as one of the \\"12 Legitimately Terrifying Comic Tales\\", saying that \\"While narrowing down one specific Hellblazer tale to add to this list is almost like picking out the best Krispy Kreme donut in a box of a dozen (they're all equally delicious!), Hellblazer: Freezes Over is a perfect blend of supernatural terror and real world nightmare situations\\" and that it was one \\"truly twisted tale\\". Now Read This! described the storyline as a \\"claustrophobic bondage\\", saying that \\"The horror and power in this volume is all derived from the various deadly effects of anticipation. Azzarello used his run on Hellblazer to dissect the working principles of the graphic horror narrative and thus moved it beyond the simple clich√©s of goblins and beasties. Hellblazer is one of the best graphic series in print. If you‚Äôre not a fan you should give it a try and thus become one.\\" =Awards= The story was nominated for the Eisner Award, and Brian Azzarello being nominated for his works with Hellblazer and 100 Bullets.

The agencies also supplied stamps to Bahrain until 1960; and to Kuwait during shortages in 1951‚Äì53. The agency in Dubai issued the Trucial States stamps on 7 January 1961. As each state took over its own postal administration, the offices closed. Closure dates were: Qatar on 23 May 1963; Dubai on 14 June 1963; Abu Dhabi on 29 March 1964; finally Muscat on 29 April 1966. Muscat The first post office to open in the region was at Muscat on 1 May 1864. This was originally under the Bombay circle but it was transferred to the Sind (Karachi) circle in April 1869 and then back to Bombay in 1879. Only one office existed until 1970. Postal control briefly passed to Pakistan after the Partition of India and then to Great Britain. After the British agency closed, the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman assumed postal control from 30 April 1966. Muscat used Indian stamps from 1 May 1864 until 19 December 1947. Stamps of Pakistan were used from 20 December 1947 until 31 March 1948 and the British agency stamps from 1 April 1948 until 29 April 1966.Rossiter & Flower, p.226. The first stamps specific to Muscat were an Indian issue with overprints on 20 November 1944 to commemorate the bicentenary of the Al-Busaid Dynasty. The issue in fifteen values from three pice to two rupees was the 1940‚Äì43 Indian definitive set, featuring George VI, overprinted in Arabic script with \\"AL BUSAID 1363\\". The first British stamps were nine current George VI definitives carrying surcharges ranging from one half anna to two rupees. Gibbons recorded twelve different issues of surcharged British stamps in Muscat, with varying numbers of values. These issues were mostly definitives but included some commemoratives such as the 1949 Universal Postal Union and 1957 World Scout Jubilee Jamboree sets.Gibbons, \\"Muscat\\" section. Bahrain A sub-post office of Bushire was opened in Manama on 1 August 1884 under Indian administration. Indian stamps were used and, from 10 August 1933, were overprinted BAHRAIN. From 1 April 1948, postal administration was handled by the British agency until the Bahrain postal service was able to take over on 1 January 1966. British issues overprinted BAHRAIN and surcharged in annas or rupees were in use until the first stamps specific to Bahrain were issued on 1 July 1960.Gibbons, \\"Bahrain\\" section. Kuwait A post office under Indian administration was opened on 21 January 1915, having been proposed as early as 1904. The office was administered from Iraq until April 1941 and then by the Indian and Pakistani services until the British agency took over on 1 April 1948. Control passed to the Kuwaiti authorities on 31 January 1959. Indian stamps were used until 1923 when they began to be overprinted KUWAIT. From May 1941 until 1945, Indian stamps without overprint were again in use. The first British issue on 1 April 1948 were George VI definitives overprinted KUWAIT with a value in annas or rupees. Stamps specific to Kuwait were first issued on 1 February 1959.Gibbons, \\"Kuwait\\" section. Qatar Muscat issues were introduced to Qatar in May 1950 when the Doha post office opened under British administration. Until then, the small amounts of mail had been channeled through the Bahrain post office using Bahrain stamps. Additional offices opened at Umm Said on 1 February 1956 and at Dukhan on 3 January 1960.Rossiter & Flower, p.228. The Muscat issues continued until 1957 when British stamps overprinted QATAR were introduced. The first stamps specific to Qatar were issued on 2 September 1961 with five types ranging from five naye paise to ten rupees. The Qatar Post Department assumed full control of the service on 23 May 1963.Gibbons, \\"Qatar\\" section. Dubai The stamps issued in Muscat were sold in Dubai until 6 January 1961.Rossiter & Flower, p.227. The two Trucial States types, which had eleven values, were introduced from 7 January 1961 to 14 June 1963 and were available in Dubai only.Gibbons, \\"Trucial States\\" section. Dubai had one post office which was Indian in origin, under the Sind circle, and opened on 19 August 1909. Until 1947, Indian stamps were in use and are distinguished by the cancellation \\"Dubai Persian Gulf\\". Pakistani stamps were used until 31 March 1948 and then the British agency issues as in Muscat. Dubai assumed control of the postal service in June 1963 when the British agency closed and began issues of its own stamps the same year. Abu Dhabi A British agency post office opened in Abu Dhabi on 30 March 1963, the postal service previously having been run via the office in Bahrain. A second office opened at the oil construction site on Das Island from 6 January 1966. The overprinted British stamps used in Muscat had been introduced to Abu Dhabi and Das Island in December 1960. Issues specific to Abu Dhabi began on 30 March 1964 and local control of the postal service began on 1 January 1967.

Re-use and recycling  In many jurisdictions, ownership of domestic waste changes once it is placed into a container for collection. It is thus illegal (although rarely enforced) to skip dive. Curb mining gets round this because the items offered are not yet placed (in a legal sense) into the \\"waste\\" stream, thus their ownership has not yet been transferred. It is often legal to curb mine, but illegal to skip dive. Some countries, notably Germany, Japan and much of Western mainland Europe, have a long tradition that items placed outside are intended specifically for re-use by others. There may be a designated day of the week or month, distinct from normal refuse collections, to encourage this.

The strategy is to create awareness of a product by handing it out for free.Walters, Helen. \\"Blu Dot's 'Real Good' Marketing Experiment\\", BusinessWeek, November 3, 2009.

Its last was assigned to the 6594th Test Group, stationed at Hickam AFB, Hawaii. It was inactivated on 1 July 1972. Mission The 6953d Test Squadron's mission was to develop and maintain a capability of effect the aerial recovery of a capsule ejected from an orbiting satellite.Mulcahy The work performed by the squadron was classified until 1995, as its primary mission was directed at recovering film imaged by the Corona strategic reconnaissance satellites produced and operated by the Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The Corona satellites were the first operational United States photographic reconnaissance satellites used for intelligence purposes. History Squadron Lockheed JC-130B 57-0527 conducting a flight test recovery of a parachute and capsule at Edwards Air Force Base, 1963. Squadron ‚Äì Sikorsky CH-3B helicopter on the deck of a recovery ship supporting the Corona Program. The Discoverer/Corona reconnaissance satellite was a revolutionary breakthrough in intelligence gathering and altered the course of the Cold War. From 1960 to 1972, the recovery of the Corona space capsules was among the highest priorities of the U.S. Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. The 6593d Test Squadron (Special) conducted one of the most important Air Force missions of the Cold War. The 6593d was one of the first Air Force organizations to combine air and space as integral parts of its mission. The classified status of the Corona program did not permit the details of Corona or its aerial recovery to be released until the declassification of Corona in 1995. Initially flying modified C-119J Flying Boxcars, equipped with rope winches and large hooks that were extended in the air behind the plane to \\"snag\\" the parachute of the payload. Later, the Flying Boxcars were replaced by larger C-130B Hercules aircraft, designated JC-130B. The squadron would fly out to a target recovery area, spacing its airplanes within the \\"box\\" for maximum coverage. A telemetry signal from the payload would send out a signal that could be triangulated on to locate where the location of the satellite, and the plane that was in the best location would proceed to recover it. On 19 August 1960, the squadron successfully recovered the Discoverer 14 payload, containing film of the first pictures of the earth's surface made from space. It was also the first recovery of an object placed in earth orbit. The squadron wanted to recover the payloads in midair while parachuting to the earth, although occasionally they were recovered from the Pacific Ocean. When recoveries from the ocean were necessary, the squadron was equipped with helicopters and also had operational control of two Navy ships to retrieve it from the ocean. Ocean recoveries, however, could damage the payload as when it hit the water, it could go under the water surface, and salt water getting inside could damage the film and other components of the payload. Throughout the 1960s as Corona Satellites were launched, their invaluable film payloads were retrieved by the squadron. It was stated by one of the units senior NCOs, that satellite payload retrieval became almost a routine mission for the well-practiced unit. Many of the squadron members served extended tours with the unit, their experience in recovery of the capsules being invaluable to its success. The unit was inactivated in 1972 and its mission turned over to the 6594th Test Group.

Midnight Marquee Press. p. 250..  Plot  The village of Sleepy Hollow is getting ready to greet the new schoolteacher, Ichabod Crane, who is coming from New York. Crane has already heard of the village's legendary ghost, a headless horseman who is said to be searching for the head that he lost in battle. The schoolteacher has barely arrived when he begins to pursue the beautiful young heiress Katrina Van Tassel, angering Abraham Van Brunt (aka \\"Brom Bones\\"), who was courting her. Crane's harsh, small-minded approach to teaching also turns some of the villagers against him. Soon, there are many who would like to see him leave the village altogether. Brom Bones trashes the schoolhouse and tries to make it look like witches allied with Ichabod Crane caused the destruction.

For authenticity, filming took place in the Hudson River Valley around Tarrytown, New York, the setting of Washington Irving's story, with its Dutch farm houses and covered bridges. The Headless Horseman was the first black-and-white feature film photographed entirely on panchromatic stock, which, while two to three times more expensive, did not have the tendency to turn blue eyes and skies white and lipstick as black like the commonly used orthochromatic film did. One effective special effect was the use of a double exposure to give the headless horseman a phantom-like appearance.

McCarthy, written by Harry L. Fraser and starring Charles Starrett and Ruth Hall. The film is based on the story The Return of Casey Jones by John Johns, published in the April 1933 issue of Railroad Stories magazine (reprinted in 2019 by Bold Venture Press in their Railroad Stories reprint collection). The film was a Monogram Pictures Corporation production. Synopsis A young boy named Jimmy is devastated after learning of the death of famed train engineer Casey Jones with whom he was good friends. In the following years, he grows up to be a train engineer, too. One morning, as Jimmy is piloting his train the brakes lose their air pressure, and the train roars along unable to be slowed or stopped. Jimmy tells the mechanic to fix it, but knowing that there is a sharp curve coming up soon and that the train will go off the tracks the mechanic jumps off the train instead. Jimmy then grabs a wrench and climbs out onto the side of the engine to try to fix it himself, but while stretching to reach the loose hose connection he is jostled and falls off the train just moments before it goes off the tracks at the curve. Unfortunately, gossip around town is that Jimmy jumped off his train two and a half miles before the curve, which was untrue, and he is branded a coward. Worse, he did not let other trains know, and as a result he is let go as engineer. The fact that Jimmy did not sign up and volunteer for army duty, as many other boys did at the time, also rankled many and added heavily to the idea that he was a coward. Actually, he had planned to sign up but his mother had a heart attack and the doctor told him if he did his mother would likely have another heart attack and it would be fatal this time. One of Jimmy's closest coworkers, who trusts him implicitly and doesn't believe the gossip, convinces the railroad to rehire him, though they will not make him an engineer again. The best they offer is a position as fireman on the train engineered by his friend (who humbly denies to Jimmy that he had anything to do with getting him back in). One dark night as their train is roaring along it loses its air pressure the same way Jimmy's had before. The engineer stoically - or more likely in shock - stands mute at the controls prepared to go all the way with the train, but Jimmy grabs a wrench and climbs out onto the engine to fix it. He succeeds and then carries the limp engineer off the train. After that he is re-branded as a hero and offered his old position as engineer again.

Robinson (22 May 1826 ‚Äì 7 November 1890) was a locomotive engineer who founded the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) on 8 May 1863 during the American Civil War, America's first union for railway workers. Robinson traveled widely and oversaw rapid growth in the union's first sixteen months. After a disastrous strike he was forced to resign in August 1864, and did not hold office again, although he remained active in union affairs until his death. Early years William D. Robinson was born on 22 May 1826. He started work as a fireman in 1846, and was promoted to locomotive engineer in 1848. He was employed by the New Albany & Salem Railroad. On 6‚Äì9 November 1855 a convention of locomotive engineers was held in Baltimore at which it was agreed to form a \\"National Protective Association of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers of the United States.\\" Benjamin Hoxie was elected President, and William D. Robinson secretary. The organization held a number of meetings up to the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, but did not make much progress. The New Albany & Salem Railroad ran into financial difficulties and was having trouble meeting payroll. In the fall of 1862 Robinson's friend J.C. Thompson arranged for him to be hired by the Michigan Central Railroad, and he moved to Detroit. Union leader In April 1863 nineteen locomotive engineers met at Robinson's house and decided to form an organization to represent their interests. Robinson was discharged from Michigan Central as an agitator. As Grand Chief he traveled widely between October 1863 and August 1864, and organized fifty-four local divisions. On 1 July 1864 the employees of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad went on strike for more pay. On 11 July 1864 the army seized the railroad and took over operations. On 16 July the strike was called off. Half the strikers, or about 75 men, got their jobs back at existing pay. The others were dismissed. It is not clear that the union had sanctioned the strike, since all employees were involved, not just locomotive engineers, and the strike was for more pay rather than for preserving existing rights. However, when the Brotherhood of the Footboard held their convention in Indianapolis on 17 August 1864 they changed their name to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and replaced Robinson as Grand Chief Engineer by Charles Wilson. The first, radical, phase of the union was over. Later career Robinson was reinstated in his old local in May 1873. Later that year the Pennsylvania Railroad ordered a reduction of pay, and the engineers went on strike. Charles Wilson publicly criticized their action. The Brotherhood called a special meeting in Cleveland on 25 February 1874. Robinson made a spirited speech vindicating the strikers, and was applauded by the delegates. Charles Wilson was forced to resign and was replaced as Grand Chief Engineer by Peter M. Arthur. For reasons of health, Robinson retired from railroad work in 1883, but continued to be active with the Brotherhood. He spoke in 1890 at a meeting of the five Brotherhoods of Railroad Fraternities, where he was reported to be old and feeble, but gave a speech full of \\"sound advice and encouragement\\". Robinson died after a prolonged illness from cancer of the stomach on 7 November 1890 in Washington, Daviess County, Indiana, at the age of 64. During his life he had seen the Brotherhood grow to 28,000 members in 452 lodges across North America. A marker was erected in 1974 at his house in Marshall, Calhoun County, Michigan, where the Railroad Union was born. References Sources   Debs, Eugene V. \\"William D.

Strecker was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and received his early education at parochial schools, including St. Joseph's College and La Salle College in Philadelphia. He entered Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia in 1907, and graduated in 1911. After his internship at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, he joined the staff of the Pennsylvania Hospital (Philadelphia) in 1913. He also taught psychiatry at Jefferson Medical College where he was later appointed professor of psychiatry and neurology. In 1925, he moved to Yale University as professor of psychiatry and taught until 1931 when he returned to Philadelphia to resume teaching at Jefferson Medical College. In 1932, he accepted an appointment as professor and chair of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Medical College, where he remained until retirement in 1952. During World War I, Strecker entered the U.S. Army at the rank of major and served as a divisional psychiatrist in France. During World War II, he served as a consultant to the Army and was active in recruiting and training psychiatrists to serve in the Army. Strecker played a major role in American psychiatry as a teacher, and he consulted for numerous government agencies and organizations. He was a member of the Philadelphia County Medical Society, the Pennsylvania Medical Society, the American College of Physicians, a member of the Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, the American Neurological Association (vice President, 1942), the American Psychiatric Association (president, 1943‚Äì1944), and a Fellow of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association of Great Britain. He delivered the Salmon Lecture of the New York Academy of Medicine in 1939. He was awarded honorary degrees from La Salle College (D.Litt.), St. Joseph's College (D.Sc.), and Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (LLD). Strecker's professional writings reflect his active career. He published over 100 monographs and journal articles including his textbooks on psychiatry and neurology. His first textbook, Practical Clinical Psychiatry, was co-authored with Franklin Ebaugh, professor of psychiatry at Colorado Medical School, and had eight editions (1940‚Äì1957). Strecker later wrote Fundamentals of Psychiatry with other professionals, and the book had six editions (1942‚Äì1952). His teaching was based on a case record approach which followed Adolph Meyer, M.D. professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. Meyer believed that psychiatric illness was part of the life trajectory of the patient. While Strecker's early publications were based on descriptive psychiatry, his later monographs and articles included the contributions of psychoanalytic theory and practice in the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Strecker retired from teaching in 1952. He died in 1959.

Biography =Vicenza= Born in Vicenza, Veneto, Capitanio started his professional career at Vicenza Calcio; he was the member of the youth squad such as the under-14 team in Veneto \\"Giovanissimi\\" League Second Division in 2006‚Äì07 season. He also spent 2010‚Äì11 season with the under-20 team (the reserve) of Sampdoria as well as the under-17 team in the 2009‚Äì10 season. Capitanio was awarded no.93 shirt of the first team in 2011‚Äì12 Serie B, for Vicenza. Capitanio played for Vicenza mostly in friendlies. He made his competitive debut in the last round of the season, losing to Pescara 0‚Äì6. He also played a few friendlies for Vicenza in May in order to prepare for the relegation \\"play-out\\" game against Empoli. Eventually Vicenza relegated as the losing side. (However, in the eve of 2012‚Äì13 Serie B, Vicenza was re-admitted as U.S. Lecce was expelled from the second division.) Despite Vicenza relegated, the club decided to transfer Capitanio to Pontedera, the newcomer of the fourth division, along with Marco Ortolan. Pontedera promoted to the third division as the runner-up of fourth division group B. Co-currently, Vicenza relegated again from Serie B as well as Cesena failed to enter promotion play-offs in order go back to Serie A. =Cesena= Once again Cesena and Vicenza made swap deal in order to strengthen the squad, as risky investment as well as boosting financial result in June 2013, as the club did in June 2010 (Tonucci‚ÄìTulli, both for ‚Ç¨1.3M; Righini‚ÄìEvangelisti, both for ‚Ç¨0.45M) and June 2011 (Tonelli‚ÄìBonicelli, both for ‚Ç¨0.6M). On 29 June 2013, the second last day of the financial year of the both clubs, Capitanio, a defender, was transferred to Cesena in co-ownership deal from Vicenza, and Mattia Filippi, a midfielder, was transferred to Vicenza from Cesena also in co-ownership.

However Cesena also did not announce the deal of Filippi.

The album is a return to his more acoustic guitar-driven earlier work. Webb was the producer, engineer, and nearly sole musician on the album, made in his home studio in Nashville, Tennessee. The themes on the album include battling cynicism, coming to terms with who God makes us to be, Jesus' nearness to the disenfranchised, unity among the divisions of the church, the hard work of marriage, and God's great love. He has called it \\"easily the most confessional and autobiographical work of my career.\\" The album came under scrutiny after it was reported that Webb was involved in an extramarital affair at the time of its release and promotion. Background Regarding the multi-faceted meaning of the album title, Webb explains that he grew up hearing that they were the three things we must learn to say in order to sustain every relationship -a friendship, marriage, or even a church community. Webb stated in an interview that \\"if I am consciously, deliberately making a record about the church again, I thought I should start with those three statements (I was wrong, I'm sorry, and I love you.).\\"http://www.theunitive.com/derek-webb-a- unitive-interview/ His intentions throughout his solo career are expressed by lyrics in the title track, \\"over all these years, there's just three things I've tried to say.\\" The title expresses a need for Christians to sincerely and earnestly say these things to the world around them and to each other. Webb says, \\"above all is an album about looking beyond our disagreements to the things we have in common, especially within the church.\\" This album is essentially a follow-up to his first solo album, 2003's She Must and Shall Go Free. As Webb approached its 10-year anniversary, he began to reflect on how that album would have looked if written today, still exploring the relationships between the church, the culture and himself. The observations, encouragements, criticisms and confessions he discovered‚Äîwhile asking the same questions 10 years later‚Äîresulted in the songs comprising I Was Wrong, I'm Sorry & I Love You. He has called the album \\"a return to strength, a rest from running, and an encouraging start to what I hope to be 10 more years of 'afflicting the comfortable and comforting the afflicted,' starting, as always, with myself.\\" The first video from the album, for the title track, was released to the Internet on July 30, 2013. The video featured Webb with clips of his fans singing along to the lyrics and holding up various signs with the chorus lyrics on them. RELEVANT magazine featured the title track, \\"I Was Wrong, I'm Sorry and I Love You\\" on their website as well as premiering its video.http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/aggregator/video-premiere-derek- webbs-i-was-wrong-im-sorry-and-i-love-you Critical reception I Was Wrong, I'm Sorry & I Love You garnered critical acclaim from music critics to critique the album. Matt Conner of CCM Magazine wrote that the release comes \\"Now that he's come full circle, he's given us his masterwork‚Äîan album armed with the wisdom that only comes from such travels.\\" At AbsolutePunk, Gregory Robson felt that \\"Being that Webb's material is deeply pensive and often takes many repeated listens to sink in, there's a chance that months down the line I Was Wrong will make more sense\\", and that \\"Given that I Was Wrong was self- produced and that Webb played almost every instrument on the album, there's little reason to dismiss it as unauthentic and/or uninspired.\\" Sean Huncherick of HM stated that \\"listening to the album feels like walking through the last 20 years of one of the industry‚Äôs most talented artists. It‚Äôs not a bad way to celebrate two decades of work.\\" At Indie Vision Music, Ian Zandi stated that in \\"Taking on a fresh perspective on some of his previous topics, Derek Webb is at the top of his game.\\" Jen Rose of Jesus Freak Hideout wrote that affirmed that \\"I Was Wrong... is a worthy contribution, multilayered with much to say, yet a musically rewarding listen even on its own\\", and wrote that \\"Though the artist's personal journey is far from done, this chapter makes for a grace-filled homecoming.\\" Also, Jesus Freak Hideout's Mark Rice evoked that \\"Without a doubt, I Was Wrong‚Ä¶ is Webb's musically most accessible album he's put out as he masters the type of sound that almost everyone can appreciate.\\" At New Release Tuesday, Mary Nikkel highlighted that \\"I Was Wrong, I'm Sorry & I Love You is a culmination, not a contradiction, of Webb's previous body of work, reflecting past themes while recasting them with humility.\\" Scott S. Mertens at The Phantom Tollbooth told that the release was \\"Somewhat tuned down, both lyrically and musically, this album is a collection of solid songs of faith.\\" Also, Derek Walker stated that \\"Early listenings made this sound like a pastiche of previous work, with several generic Webb tunes\\"; however, \\"it may not show Webb's more controversial prophetic side, but it has plenty to commend it.\\" Track listing Personnel ;CreditsDerek Webb, I Was Wrong, I'm Sorry & I Love You (liner notes), Fair Trade Services, 2013 *All instruments played by Derek Webb *Additional drums & percussion on ‚ÄòEverything Will Change‚Äô by Will Sayles *Organs on ‚ÄòNothing But Love‚Äô by Joshua Moore *Additional vocals by Sandra McCracken on ‚ÄòI Measure The Days (Simplified Anglican Chant)‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Vow‚Äô *String arrangements on ‚ÄòEverything Will Change‚Äô & ‚ÄòNothing But Love‚Äô by Ben Shive *David Angell on violin and John Catchings on cello *Produced & Recorded by ‚Äì Derek Webb at Ft.

These dismissals were followed by the resignations of three more cabinet ministers and another parliamentary secretary, in sympathy with those dismissed. Initially, this only left the President and one other minister in post, although one of those who had resigned rescinded his resignation within a few hours. The reasons that the ex-ministers put forward for the confrontation and subsequent resignations were the autocratic attitude of Banda, who failed to consult other ministers and kept power in his own hands, his insistence on maintaining diplomatic relations with South Africa and Portugal and a number of domestic austerity measures. It is unclear whether the former ministers intended to remove Banda entirely, to reduce his role to that of a non- executive figurehead or simply to force him to recognise collective cabinet responsibility. Banda seized the initiative, firstly, by dismissing some of the dissidents rather than negotiating, and secondly, (after the resignations) by holding a debate on a motion of confidence on 8 and 9 September 1964. As the result of the debate was an overwhelming vote of confidence, Banda declined to reinstate any of the ministers or offer them any other posts, despite the urging of the Governor-General to compromise. After some unrest, and clashes between supporters of the ex-ministers and of Banda, most of the former left Malawi in October with their families and leading supporters, for Zambia or Tanzania. One ex-minister, Henry Chipembere went into hiding inside Malawi and, in February 1965 led a small, unsuccessful armed uprising. After its failure, he was able to arrange for his transfer to the USA. Another ex- minister, Yatuta Chisiza, organised an even smaller incursion from Mozambique in 1967, in which he was killed. Several of the former ministers died in exile or, in the case of Orton Chirwa in a Malawian jail, but some survived to return to Malawi after Banda was deposed and to return to public life. The Cabinet Crisis, sometimes referred to as the Revolt of the Ministers is one of the most important but also most controversial episodes in the history of independent Malawi. Many of the contemporary documentary sources were written by expatriate diplomats and officials who were not close to the ex-ministers, and in some cases antipathetic to them. These accounts have been contradicted by the autobiographies, often written long after the event, of the ex- ministers themselves, although these are also inconsistent with one another. The principal published works quoted rely on a mixture of documentary sources and interviews with participants, both African and expatriate, and suggest that the crisis arose in a political culture that permitted no dissent, and treated attempts to debate issues as plotting. Nyasaland African Congress =Development of Congress= For most of the colonial period, most Africans in Nyasaland had no political voice and only a small number of chiefs had a very limited influence on the colonial government and they did not represent the interests of a growing body of African town dwellers. Most early African interest groups were local, represented only a small, mainly urban educated African elite and promoted their demands for a political voice, not independence. Only in the 1940s, with the formation of the Nyasaland African Congress, did one organisation represent the whole of Nyasaland.van Velson (1966), Some Early Pressure Groups in Malawi, pp. 376-8, 400, 411. From 1944, various African local associations united into the Nyasaland African Congress, which demanded African representation on the Legislative Council that advised the colonial governors.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 271, 313‚Äì16. From 1946, the Nyasaland African Congress received financial and political support from Hastings Banda, then living in Britain. Post-war British governments of both main parties agreed to the formation of a federation of the three British territories in Central Africa, rather than their complete amalgamation, as the Southern Rhodesian government preferred: the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was pushed through in 1953 against very strong African opposition.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 62, 65‚Äì6. Federation radicalised some younger Congress members, and when in 1955 the Colonial Office agreed that the Legislative Council should include five African members nominated by Provincial Councils, they seized the opportunity. Although the Provincial Councils were largely composed of chiefs, their members were receptive to popular wishes, and they nominated Congress members or supporters to the Legislative Council. In 1956, Henry Chipembere and Kanyama Chiume, two young radical members of Congress, were nominated together with two moderate Congress members and a Congress supporter. This success led to a rapid growth in Congress membership in 1956 and 1957.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 341‚Äì2. Chipembere and Chiume were members of a new generation of pan-Africanist politicians, deeply influenced by Socialist and sometimes Marxist ideas and experiences acquired outside Malawi, who realised the value of a well-organised mass movement. Chipembere was a southerner, but many others were northerners. Chiume was born in the Nkhata Bay district but educated entirely in Tanganyika and Uganda. Dunduzu Chisiza and his elder brother, Yatuta Chisiza, had been born in Karonga District before becoming a long-term residents of Uganda and Tanganyika. They were influenced both by Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda; Dunduzu had also lived in Southern Rhodesia before being deported to Nyasaland for his political activities.J McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, p. 76. During the 1950s, these younger men displaced the older generation as leaders of Congress. They expressed hostility towards Europeanization, which cut them off from their cultural roots, an African middle class sympathising with Federation and the autocratic Chiefs. However, as they lacked status and knowledge of local African customs, they needed a charismatic older man as their leader. The chosen leader, Dr Banda, was sensitive to the country's political tradition. In preaching defiance of the \\"stupid Federation\\", Banda was in tune with the popular mood, but he also defended the chiefs and the rights of the older generation of educated men.M L Chanock, (1975). Ambiguities in the Malawian Political Tradition, p. 344. =Banda's return= The younger members of the Nyasaland African Congress had little faith in its leader, T D T Banda, and wished to replace him with Dr Hastings Banda, who had by then moved to the Gold Coast. Dr Banda announced he would only return if given the presidency of Congress: after this was agreed, he returned to Nyasaland in July 1958 and T D T Banda was ousted.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 344‚Äì5. When Banda returned to Nyasaland, which he had left in 1915, he was over 60. Chipembere and Chiume and most other leading Congress activists were in their late 20s or early 30s. As well as the age difference there was, from the start, a disagreement about Banda's role: the activists saw him as a figurehead, but he saw himself as the leader of Congress and expected their obedience.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 2‚Äì3. Banda was absolutely opposed to Federation, but otherwise more moderate in his speeches that the younger Congress members. Both Chipembere and Chiume avoided social contact with Europeans and, in their speeches, they frequently denounced Europeans as a group, in contrast to Banda's relatively cordial relations with individual Europeans.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 207. Banda appointed Chipembere as Treasurer, Chiume as Publicity Secretary and Dunduzu Chisiza as Secretary-general of Congress. He also appointed four other young radicals to the party's Executive Committee, ignoring older moderates, but made it clear that he regarded his appointees as subordinates, not colleagues. Although these appointees had senior positions, these came with a heavy workload and tied them to the MCP headquarters in Blantyre, away from their grassroots support.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 6‚Äì7. In the nine months between his return and the declaration of a State of Emergency, Banda combined opposition to Federation with more popular causes, such as the African smallholders' dislike of agricultural practices imposed on them. He used these popular issues to mobilise Congress supporters into strikes, disobedience and protests that would disrupt the everyday operation of the colonial government.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 347‚Äì49.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 155. The 1959 Emergency =Background= In January 1958, Banda presented Congress proposals for an African majority in the Legislative Council to the governor, Sir Robert Armitage. As this would have led to a demand for withdrawal from the Federation, Armitage refused. This breakdown in talks led to Congress demands for more violent anti-government action, and leading Congress activists made increasingly inflammatory statements. Armitage was influenced by reports from police informers, who claimed Congress planned the indiscriminate killing of Europeans and Asians, and of its African opponents, the so-called \\"murder plot\\". There is no evidence that a murder plot existed, but the refusal of Banda or other Congress leaders to condemn the violent actions of Congress members gave it some plausibility. Armitage prepared for mass arrests and, on 20 February, troops from Rhodesia were flown into Nyasaland. In the days following 20 February, both Chipembere and Yatuta Chisiza made a number of provocative speeches, many followed by disturbances, and the police or troops fired on some of these, leading to four deaths.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 296‚Äì7.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 296, 349‚Äì51. On 3 March 1959 Armitage declared a State of Emergency over the whole of the protectorate and arrested Banda, other members of the Congress executive committee and over a hundred local party officials. The Nyasaland African Congress was banned the next day. Those arrested were detained without trial and the total number detained finally rose to over 1,300. Rather than calming the situation immediately, in the emergency that followed fifty-one Africans were killed and many more were wounded.C Baker, (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, p. 28. By the night of 3 March, most principal Congress leaders had been arrested and detained. Some were released very quickly, but 72 prominent detainees, including Banda, were flown to Southern Rhodesia. Others were detained in Nyasaland. In the immediate aftermath of arrest, 21 people were killed and many wounded.C Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 40‚Äì2, 48. =Aftermath= Within two days of the declaration of the state of emergency, the British cabinet under Harold Macmillan decided to set up a Commission of Inquiry into the disturbances. Macmillan did not choose its chairman, Devlin, and later criticised his appointment on the basis of his Irish ancestry and Catholic upbringing. Macmillan not only broadly rejected the Devlin Report, which had taken several months to prepare, but engineered the production of the rival Armitage Report, which was prepared very quickly so it could be released on the same day as the Devlin Report.A Horne, (2008) Macmillan: The Official Biography, pp. 180‚Äì1. The Devlin Commission concentrated on three areas: the State of Emergency, the murder plot and African opposition to Federation. It found that the declaration of a State of Emergency was necessary to restore order and prevent a descent into anarchy, but it criticised instances of the illegal use of force by the police and troops. It also found that the Nyasaland government's suppression of criticism and of support for Congress justified calling it a \\"police state\\". Its strongest criticism was over the \\"murder plot\\", which it said not exist, and the use made of it by both the Nyasaland and British governments in trying to justify the Emergency, which it condemned. It also declared that Banda had no knowledge of the inflammatory talk of some Congress activists about attacking Europeans. Finally, it noted the almost universal rejection of Federation by Nyasaland's African people and suggested the British government should negotiate with African leaders on the country's constitutional future.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 356, 359.C Baker (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, pp. 40‚Äì1. The Nyasaland government had imprisoned Banda, not realising that he was the only African politician they could negotiate with on a credible constitution for the protectorate. At first, the British government tried to calm the situation by nominating additional African members (who were not Congress supporters) to the Legislative Council. However, it soon decided that the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland could not be maintained and that Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia should be given responsible government under majority rule. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government to deal with him. Banda was released in April 1960 and invited to London to discuss proposals for responsible government.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 287‚Äì94, 296‚Äì9, 309‚Äì13. Chipembere, Dunduzu Chisiza and his brother Yatuta were arrested in the State of Emergency and imprisoned with Banda for 13 months in Gwelo in Southern Rhodesia, but Chiume, who was in London, escaped arrest. This did little to bring Banda and the others together: Banda became concerned with Chipembere's volatile temper, and Banda's increasingly authoritarian attitudes alarmed his three fellow prisoners. Chipembere and the Chisiza brothers remained in detention, first in Rhodesia and later in Nyasaland, after Banda was released. Iain Macleod, the Colonial Secretary was at first suspicious of Banda, and regarded the three others as extremists. He eventually agreed to Banda's request for their release, but they were among the last to be released in September 1960.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 377. This was after Banda had returned from constitutional talks in London, where he had been accompanied by Orton Chirwa, a lawyer and Aleke Banda, a young activist. In May 1960, Chiume returned to Nyasaland and his attempts to ingratiate himself with Banda led to his estrangement from Chipembere and the Chisiza brothers. After his release, Chipembere embarked on a series of fiery speeches: the colonial authorities considered these were sufficiently threatening to warrant his arrest, and he was again imprisoned, receiving a three-year sentence in January 1961. Chiume escaped prosecution for his speeches, as he was considered of lower importance. Chipembere was still in prison in August 1961, when Banda (who had insisted on selecting all his party's candidates) won an overwhelming electoral victory. The new Governor, Glyn Smallwood Jones was willing to discuss Chipembere's early release but despite Dunduzu Chisiza's urging, Banda allowed Chipembere to serve much of his sentence until his release in January 1963. In August 1961, Chipembere's father had been elected to the Legislative Council in place of his son, but gave up his seat on Chipembere's release.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 9, 14, 27.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 209‚Äì11. The Malawi Congress Party =Formation= Chirwa and Aleke Banda had only been detained for a short time and in 1959 they had formed the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) to replace the banned Nyasaland African Congress, making it clear that they were acting on behalf of the imprisoned Banda. The reconstitution of Congress as the Malawi Congress Party from September 1959 marked a major shift in its character. The Nyasaland African Congress was an anti-colonial liberation movement but after the 1961 elections, the MCP was in government. There was a regional shift in support for the MCP: in both the Southern and Central Provinces, people flocked to join the party but, in the north, branches were formed only in a limited number of places. The MCP quickly emerged as a larger party, distinctly more authoritarian in its approach, than Congress had been. It became a mass party, but Chipembere and the Chisizas were unknown to many of the new members, who regarded Banda as the sole leader.J McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, pp. 76, 80-1.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 198. In the 1961 elections, MPC won 22 out of the 28 available Legislative Council seats, including all the \\"lower roll\\" seats, which had a predominantly African electorate. The largest group of MPC Legislative Council members was formed of eight who had received at least secondary education, mainly former students; five of the six early ministerial appointments fell to this group. They were generally under 35 (only Chirwa was over 40), and a disproportionate number of these came from the Northern Region, because several mission schools there taught to a high standard. The next group was of local MCP bosses who were generally a decade older than the first group. They were generally less well educated but had stronger local ties, and after the 1964 crisis, several of them replaced the former ministers of the first group. At first, MPC backbench members raised questions on sensitive issues and questioned ministers with relative freedom, but by late 1962, this had ceased and only the few non-MCP Legislative Council members were able to offer any criticism. Banda started to intervene in the speeches of ministers and to cut short debates, arguing that he alone made policy.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 381, 403-4. Before the elections, the Colonial Office had assumed that MPC would be entitled to three Executive Council seats through winning a majority of the \\"lower roll\\" seats. As the Lancaster House agreement provided that two Executive Council seats would go to ministers elected by the \\"upper roll\\" of largely European and Asian electors, it was thought that the mainly white United Federal Party would gain both these seats: with five officials also sitting, there would be a non-MCP majority on the Executive Council. In the event, the United Federal Party only won five Legislative Council seats, two going to MPC and one to an MCP-inclined independent, Colin Cameron. The Governor offered the United Federal Party a single Executive Council seat, which it refused. This left all five elected seats for MCP candidates. In theory, Jones, the Governor, was entitled to allocate portfolios, but he allowed Banda to make nominations. Banda decided to take two for himself, becoming both Minister of Natural Resources and Minister of Local Government. Chiume became Minister of Education and Augustine Bwanausi became Minister of Labour. The two upper roll ministers were Colin Cameron (Minister of Works) and Mikeka Mkandawire as Minister without Portfolio. Two MCP parliamentary secretaries were also appointed, but did not sit in the Executive Council. These were Dunduzu Chisiza in the Ministry of Finance and Orton Chirwa in the Ministry of Justice. Two additional appointments were made in March 1962, of John Msonthi and Willie Chokani, and Chirwa became the Minister of Justice and Attorney-general at the start of 1964.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 381‚Äì2.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 p. 45. =In government= When Banda and four other MCP ministers joined five officials on the Executive Council, they formed a Responsible government accountable to the Governor. A timetable for full self-government independence was agreed at a constitutional conference in London in 1962 and the Jones allowed Banda and the MPC ministers and parliamentary secretaries, now seven in total, to initiate policies. Nyasaland achieved internal self-government with Banda as Prime Minister in February 1963. Full independence was gained (and the country's name became Malawi) on 6 July 1964, with Banda as Prime Minister. Malawi became a republic within the Commonwealth, on 6 July 1966, when Banda became its first President.J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 159, 170.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, p. 313. In February 1963, Banda, as Prime Minister, was able to select a cabinet of 10 members to replace the Executive Council. This included the temporary appointment of Henry Phillips the former Financial Secretary as Minister of Finance, the post Dunduzu Chisiza would have taken but for his death in 1962. Other official members left office. Chipembere joined the cabinet as Minister of Local Government, and Chiume added Social Development to his Education post. There were some changes of portfolios: Willie Chokani took over as Minister of Labour, replacing Augustine Bwanausi, who became Minister of the Interior, and John Tembo was made a parliamentary secretary, with the intention of his replacing Phillips, who retired in early 1964. The Governor suggested that Bwanausi had more experience and would be a better choice as Minister of Finance, but Banda was insistent on Tembo. Msonthi and Cameron retained their existing posts and Mkandawire left the cabinet by his own choice. At this time, Aleke Banda, a close aide to Banda, was made MCP secretary-general.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 80‚Äì1, 91-2, 95-6, 333. Generally, the MCP ministers were very active in their new roles and, although there was some friction with permanent officials, they were effective J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 388. Banda, as Minister of Natural Resources (which included farming), introduced three crucial reforms, the abolition of punitive element of conservation practices (although not the conservation measures themselves), the final abolition of thangata through the Africans on Private Estates Act in 1962, and the reform of the marketing of peasant crops.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 390‚Äì2. Chiume, the Minister of Education, promoted the expansion of secondary education, the creation of a teacher training college and a polytechnic and sending Malawian students to overseas universities, pending the creation of a university in Malawi. The last led to accusations of favouring fellow-northerners when granting scholarships. Chiume, an abrasive personality, more controversially attacked the hold of the missions on education and insisted on bringing them under greater state control.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 400‚Äì2. =Banda's leadership= Soon after the Lancaster House constitutional conference in 1962, Banda made it clear in the Legislative Council that he alone was responsible for making policy, which the ministers were to execute without debate or dissent. No criticism of Banda was permitted, but Banda allowed ministers to criticise each other and did not counter claims that the significant number of ministers from the north were favouring fellow northerners. Chiume in particular was involved in disputes with Cameron, the Minister of Works and Dunduzu Chisiza the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance. In August 1962, both Cameron and Chisiza offered their resignations to the Governor but were persuaded to remain in post; Chisiza died shortly afterwards. Banda was accused of building-up an entourage based on his own Chewa group, but before the 1963 election, he held the balance between competing MCP factions.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 403, 406-7. Dunduzu Chisiza had died in September 1962, apparently in a car crash, although many people in Malawi continue to believe he was murdered on Banda's instructions. Although the balance of probabilities is that Chisiza's death was accidental, it is clear that before his death, he saw the possibility of a dictatorship as a major threat. His preference was for a strong central government uniting all sectional interests and allowing dissenting views to be expressed. In a pamphlet written shortly before his death, he argued that, whereas it was necessary for the strong leadership of one individual and acceptance of his decisions during an independence struggle, once independence had been achieved, the former subordinates should cease to be submissive. He considered that a leader surrounded only by willing subordinates would soon become dictatorial; a prescient claim in view of Banda's later actions. Chisiza agreed with Banda on many issues, however on others he dissented more, and more publicly, than any other minister.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 410‚Äì2. Independence Until Banda was sworn in as Prime Minister on 1 February 1963, the Governor retained the ultimate responsibility for law and order. Immediately after this, despite some attacks by MCP militants on Jehovah's Witnesses and members of opposition parties, the situation was generally calm until the pre- independence election campaign began in late 1963. By January 1964, almost every opposition leader had fled the country and over 1,800 attacks on political opponents of the MPC and Jehovah's Witnesses were recorded in January and February 1964. This violence was orchestrated by local MCP bosses, but Banda did little to stop it,J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 418‚Äì20. In July 1963, Banda took over Msonthi's portfolio of Transport and Communication and removed him from the cabinet without giving any reason, although Chipembere later stated it was probable that Msonthi was suspected of corruption, and others mentioned his drinking. At the time, other ministers suspected that Banda had removed Msonthi to test their reaction to an arbitrary sacking. Banda also claimed in cabinet that he had considered dismissing other (unnamed) ministers, and the whole affair increased ministerial insecurity. Msonthi was reappointed to the cabinet in August 1963, and soon after the three MCP regional chairmen were given ministerial status, diluting the influence of existing ministers.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965, pp. 91‚Äì2, 95-6, 333.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 430. Differences between Banda and the ministers arose for several reasons. Firstly, Banda insisted on making all the important decisions relating to the state and the MCP, including nominating all the candidates for election, and he refused to devolve real responsibility to them. Within the MCP, Banda set up a new committee to strengthen and centralise party discipline, reducing local control. He also became life president of the MCP in February 1963. After the 1963 election, Banda began to make slighting references to the ministers in speeches. Earlier, his criticism had been in private, but on 27 October 1963, he berated them in a long public speech. More privately, he accused Chipembere, Chiume and Bwanausi of forming a cabal against him. In November 1963, he took over Chiume's ministerial responsibilities for Education and Social Development without removing him from the cabinet, where he was given responsibility for the transition to independence. Chipembere then became Minister of Education. Banda later claimed this was done to drive a wedge between Chipembere and Chiume. In a further cabinet reshuffle, Yatutza Chisiza took on Home Affairs and Bwanausi moved to Development and Transport. Banda himself retained the Trade and Industry, Health, Natural Resources and Social Development portfolios as well as being Prime Minister. His holding so many posts and devolving the day-to-day work to parliamentary secretaries was criticised, as was the frequency with which he shifted ministers around. Banda's appointment of his followers to statutory bodies also appeared to diminish the power and influence of existing ministers.C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 80‚Äì1.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965, pp. 91‚Äì2, 95-6, 333.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 403‚Äì4. Secondly, Banda continued diplomatic relations with South Africa and Portugal, but refused to recognise the People's Republic of China or East Germany, despite most ministers' ideological concerns, and contemptuously rejected attempts by Chiume and Yatuta Chisiza to form closer ties with Zambia and Tanganyika. Thirdly, the slow pace of Africanization in the Civil Service, the freezing of Civil Service salaries and the introduction of a charge for outpatients at state hospitals were not seen as passing the benefits of independence to the people.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 317‚Äì8. The Cabinet Crisis =Initial disagreements= Since the Cabinet Crisis of 1964, there has been disagreement on the extent to which rivalries within the MCP in the early 1960s reflected generational and ideological tensions between Dr Banda and his younger ministers or regional divisions. Following the release of the Chisiza brothers and Chipembere in October 1960, the influence of northerners appeared to grow, reaching a peak in September 1961 when Yatuta Chisiza was appointed the party's Administrative Secretary alongside his brother, Dunduzu, the Secretary General; Chiume was Publicity Secretary; Orton Chirwa was Legal Adviser; and Rose Chibambo, the only woman on the party's National Executive, was Chairman of the Woman's League. This apparent northern dominance, masked divisions and politicians born in the north pursued various personal and ideological agendas and did not act as a regional bloc. After the Lancaster House conference made it clear that independence would be achieved, MCP became a more divided party. The focus moved away from achieving independence towards the allocation of resources between ministries and regions. Resentment of the hold that better-educated northerners had on scarce jobs was used by Banda to assert his authority by playing ministers off against one another, but there is no evidence of him adopting a pro-Chewa, anti-northern stance before the 1964 crisis. None of the ministers who resigning in 1964 drew attention to regional distinctions, but Banda's allies from the Central Region accused northern politician in general and Chiume in particular of favouritism, and voiced Chewa resentment against senior civil servants from the north, many of whom had demonstrated in favour of the former ministers. Rose Chibambo came in for particularly violent abuse, probably because of anti-female as well as anti-northern prejudice.J McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, pp. 80‚Äì1, 83-4.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 404‚Äì5, 435-6. Colin Cameron, the only European minister remaining at independence on 6 July 1964, stated that, at that time, all the African ministers apart from Chiume had decided to press for rapid Africanization and links with other African states, and to end Banda's dictatorial behaviour. On his return from a visit to Cairo on 26 July, Banda made a public speech threatening ministers; this had the perverse effect of uniting them all, including Chiume. Banda's proposal to reintroduce detention without trial at the cabinet meeting of 29 July 1964 united all the ministers against him, but only Colin Cameron resigned. Chipembere later explained that the other ministers did not resign as detention was a popular issue they could not oppose, but they hoped it would be used sparingly.C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 72. On 10 August, the ministers attending (Tembo was not present, and Chiume was probably also absent) asked Banda to stop making slighting references to them in speeches and not to hold so many government portfolios himself. Chipembere later recorded that Banda gave them a hearing, but was concerned that they were \\"ganging up\\" against him, and was reluctant to meet them as a group. However, Banda appeared to accept their concerns and apologised about the hurtful remarks he had made about them.C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 72‚Äì3. =The ministers complain= At the cabinet meeting of 26 August 1964, all the ministers present (including to some degree John Tembo) raised their concerns about Banda's failure to Africanise, his relations with Portugal and South Africa and their own ambiguous position. The ministers present presented Banda with a list of grievances: he made no immediate answer, neither accepting or rejecting what the list contained.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 431, 451.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 317‚Äì8. Banda was apparently surprised by the strength of the opposition at this cabinet meeting, even though his recent relations with Chipembere and Yatutu Chisiza had been difficult. A number of ministers led by Chisiza apparently wished to convert Banda's role from that of Prime Minister, with an expected progression to become executive President, to be in the future a President without executive functions, with an appointed Prime Minister as head of government. Chiume had been a prominent supporter of Banda and, since 1959, had not been close to the more radical group. However, once Banda had strongly rejected his plan to accept aid from China, Chiume began to attack him, and precipitated the confrontation of 26 August 1964.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 159‚Äì60.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p 212. The ministers thought that their united stand had been successful. They did not know that Banda had already decided not to agree to their demands, but wanted to test how strong his support was by consulting MCP leaders before taking action. He also had Special Branch reports on the ministers, to assess their likely reaction to the dismissal of some of their colleagues. On 31 August, Banda told his expatriate cabinet secretary that he intended to have no further discussions with the ministers. He intended to resign as Prime Minister, but only because it would automatically end the tenure of the other ministers: on reappointment he would form a new cabinet without Chipembere, Chiume and Chisiza, but with the addition of four new ministers loyal to him. On 1 September, he advised the Governor-general of his intention not to reappoint Chiume or Chisiza: he said Chipembere and Msonthi might also be dropped.C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 77. At a further meeting with the ministers, excluding Chipembere who was in Canada, on 2 September 1964, Banda made no concessions to the ministers, and the meeting ended in chaos, with Banda ordering them out of the cabinet room. The ministers then met and proposed that Banda should be forced to resign, with Chirwa becoming Prime minister and Chipembere left out of the cabinet. After the abortive cabinet meeting, Banda contacted the Governor-general, who advised him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament rather than resign. His success there in the Malawi parliament in 1964 was a foregone conclusion, as it had no opposition party members and as all the MCP members were personally nominated by Banda.C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 78. =The confidence vote= On 7 September at an informal meeting, Banda appealed to Members of Parliament to support him in a vote of confidence to be held after a debate on 8 and 9 September. Also on 7 September, Banda called upon Glyn Jones, as Governor-general to issue dismissal letters to Chirwa, Chiume, and Bwanausi, who all accepted their dismissals with dignity. Rose Chibambo, a parliamentary secretary, was also dismissed. The other cabinet members, except for John Tembo, showed solidarity with their colleagues. On the same day, Yatuta Chisiza, Chokani and, after some hesitation, Msonthi handed their resignations to the Governor-general. Chokani later claimed that Jones urged him not to resign and, after taking advice, Msonthi withdrew his resignation a few hours later: Banda immediately accepted this. Jones then suggested a meeting between the other resigning ministers and Banda, but Chisiza and Chokani declined. It is not clear whether, having dismissed Chiume, Chirwa and Bwanausi, Banda expected Chipembere and Yatutu Chisiza to continue in office, but they resigned.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 162‚Äì3.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 220‚Äì1. None of the ministers who were dismissed or who had resigned made any significant effort to mobilise support from other Members of Parliament, most of whom owed their nominations to Banda, although they had significant support from African civil servants.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 431‚Äì3. Tembo and Msonthi, the only two cabinet ministers left, opened the debate by proposing the motion of confidence, but Banda's lengthy speech dominated it. In this, he claimed that the ministers had conspired against him, because he had preventing them abusing their positions and because they were being controlled by China's ambassador in Dar es Salaam. In response, only Chiume set out any detailed criticism of Banda, the others concentrated on stating their continued loyalty to him, despite being denounced as traitors. Chipembere returned from Canada on 8 September. Banda had written to him, asking him to remain in the cabinet, but this was before the debate, when Banda was uncertain of what support he had. Chipembere wished to effect a reconciliation between Banda and the ministers, and approached the Governor-General, asking him to request Banda to postpone the debate. However, as the first day of the debate had gone in Banda's favour, he decided against reconciliation and refused a postponement. Chipembere therefore resigned on the morning of 9 September and attended parliament as a back-bencher, sitting with the other ex-ministers. Chipembere's speech deplored the breakdown of party unity and that the ex-ministers had been reviled as traitors. He expressed his general support for their grievances, and although he expressed loyalty to Banda, he pointedly argued that cabinet responsibility should be collective and that there should be consultation on important issues.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 433‚Äì5.C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 82, 85.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 162‚Äì4. The end of the debate was something of an anti-climax, with Banda proclaiming that, \\"This is not a cabinet crisis at all ...\\". However, as all members of parliament were required to speak, they had to declare for or against the motion of confidence. Few spoke in favour of the ex-ministers, even their family members. After the debate, Jones suggested that Banda should meet the ex-ministers. Banda was unwilling to meet them as long as they insisted on an all or nothing reinstatement, but he was willing to consider re-instating Chokani and Bwanausi, and possibly Chirwa, but not Chipembere or Chiume. Jones' efforts to enable the reinstatement some of the ministers between September 16 and 18 failed, as did his last-ditch attempt at compromise on September 26, when a meeting planned by Chipembere in Blantyre on that day and the next was banned, ostensibly because he had not obtained police permission.C Baker, (2000). Sir Glyn Jones, A Proconsul in Africa pp. 234, 237 As clashes between supporters of the ex-ministers and Banda began, any hope of reconciliation faded. Over the next few weeks a number of senior civil servants and associates of the former ministers left Malawi as the conflict spread. Zomba became a centre of support for the ex-ministers and to counteract this on the night of 27/28 September, supporters of Banda from the Youth League of the MCP were bussed into Zomba and tried to close Zomba market and force those civil servants that were on strike back to work. However, the more numerous civil servants, armed themselves with sticks and attacked MCP supporters and burned down the party's national headquarters and a shop owned by the local MCP chairman. During these disturbances, one newly-appointed minister, Albert Muwalo was assaulted by the pro-Chipembere crowd, and another was severely beaten. By 30 September Muwalo and every other minister that supported Banda had left Zomba and supporters of the dismissed ministers remained in control of Zomba until troops and police moved in to restore calm a few days later.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 435, 437-9.C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 103‚Äì4. The ministers that had resigned or were dismissed had no coherent plans for resisting Banda and disagreed about what should happen when his powers were reduced. On the other hand, Banda had, in the six years since he had returned to the country, gained control of the MCP where his supporters controlled it in all three regions of Malawi and many districts, and had appointed many of its MPs. In addition, the security forces and police remained loyal, so Banda would have been difficult to dislodge if, as he did, he refused to relinquish power.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 446. The Causes of the Cabinet Crisis Chiume later drew attention to long standing political differences between Banda and the younger generation of MCP leaders, some going back to Banda's return in 1959, although until shortly before the August 1964 crisis, Chiume publicly supported Banda enthusiastically. Chipembere rejected this claim, dating their opposition to the post- independence period when Banda's actions became intolerable to them.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 446. Banda claimed in September and October 1964 that the ex-ministers, particularly Chiume and Chipembere, had been plotting to remove him from office and that these plots had been going on for some time. This is unlikely in view of the ministers' lack of agreed objectives and the unplanned nature of their response.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 pp. 2‚Äì3.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 404, 433, 440. The conversion of Chiume from loyalty to Banda bordering on sycophancy at odds with several of his cabinet colleagues to leading cabinet opposition to Banda took place extraordinarily quickly in August 1964, and his actions in leading the opposition to Banda was the nearest thing there was to any concerted plot. Both Chipembere in September and Chirwa in October tried to resolve to the crisis through compromise rather than plotting.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 211‚Äì2, 220.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 433‚Äì4, 439. In a paper written by Chipembere (reprinted in Baker), Chipembere ascribes Banda starting to criticise ministers publicly from October 1963 to British administrative and intelligence officers who surrounded Dr. Banda and felt insecure in their jobs. These, said Chipembere, worked for the radicals' dismissal from the cabinet by creating suspicion and distrust in Dr. Banda's mind. He claimed to have found this out when visiting a neighbouring African country around this time, but did not give the source of this information.C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 265‚Äì6. From February 1963, Banda received monthly reports from the police Special Branch, which he did not share with his cabinet colleagues. A number of these reports were critical of certain specific activities of Chipembere and Chiume.C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 60, 68.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 p. 179. As Chipembere neither states the source of his information nor is specific about who the British officers surrounding Banda were, it is difficult to evaluate his claims. However, both he and Banda talk in terms of plots and misinformation. This may arise from the prevailing MCP intolerance of any perceived or imagined dissent. From 1956, Chipembere and Chiume promoted mass nationalism and led a major recruiting drive for the Nyasaland African Congress. Even in the early years, elements of a totalitarian ideology intolerant of any dissent started to appear. As Chipembere noted of himself in 1961, he had denounced the multi-party system as \\"... a system of Government with a built-in subversive mechanism.\\"J McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 237‚Äì40. Between his release in April 1960 and independence in July 1964, Banda and his followers made MCP into an absolutist body. As early as August 1958, Banda had claimed the right to make all MCP appointments and dismiss any member of the party. He also became its Life President and the centre of a personality cult fostered by Chiume as Publicity Secretary. Members of opposition parties were harassed and assaulted, trade unions were fiercely criticised and there was an attack on mission-based churches in the party newspaper. All were seen as rivals to MCP, even Jehovah's Witnesses, whose movement was detached from politics, and whose members declined to join MCP. All forms of political intolerance and violence increased before the 1963 pre-independence elections.J McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 242‚Äì4. In May 1964, Chiume looked forward to Malawi being organised with no opposition at all and claimed that there was nothing wrong with dictatorship. Banda went further in saying that any government chosen by the people themselves was not a dictatorship. By the time that many of the ministers had concerns about the reintroduction of Preventive Detention in July 1964, the possibility of reasoned opposition to Banda was long past. The Cabinet Crisis did not therefore represent any change in the nature of MCP, merely that, as external enemies had been subdued, its leader made enemies of the party's own long-term members.J McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 245, 248-9. After the Crisis and Chipembere's Revolt =The ministers leave= In October 1964, Chokani and Bwanausi, who had refused to rejoin the cabinet without their colleagues, left voluntarily for Zambia following Banda's refusal to negotiate. Chiume and Chisiza, who had gone to the north of Malawi in September, both crossed into Tanzania (as Tanganyika had become) on 1 October because they feared for their safety. Chirwa met Banda in the hope of serving as a judge but was beaten up by Banda's guards, and went into hiding before leaving secretly for Tanzania on 22 October. Chipembere had remained at his home in Fort Johnston District, avoiding any contact with Banda or Jones, under the protection of numerous local supporters. On 25 October, Banda claimed at an MPC meeting that the ex- ministers were plotting to overthrow him by force. Chipembere left his house on 28 October to go into hiding, following which Banda ordered his arrest, \\"... alive if possible, but if not alive then any other way.\\"J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 439‚Äì40. After Cameron had resigned in July 1964, he was advised to leave the country in November 1964, and returned to Scotland.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 p. 355. The British government thought an outcome to the crisis in which Banda shed some of his powers to the ministers but remained in charge would be ideal but, failing that, it was prepared to back him against his ministers. There was the fear that Chipembere and Chiume would align Malawi too closely with China, whereas Banda would be more favourable to British interests. Glyn Jones, as Governor-general was in a difficult position as he could only advise and had no executive power. In September 1964 his frequent meeting with Banda and the ministers, except for Chiume (who refused to meet him), both before and after they left office, were aimed at an accommodation between Banda and at least some of the ministers. His constitutional duty was however to support Banda once he had won the vote of confidence. Chipembere later claimed that expatriate civil servants and security officers had turned Banda against him and his colleagues. While there is little doubt that many expatriates preferred Banda to Chipembere and Chiume, there is no real evidence that they caused this estrangement.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 446. =Armed conflict= Although there was widespread dissatisfaction in the north of Malawi, there was no major uprising there after the Cabinet Crisis. There was concern that Chiume and Chisiza would mount an invasion from Tanzania, but the armed uprising was in the south. After Chipembere went into hiding in the east of Fort Johnston District, he gathered a group of supports including politicians, civil servants and young activists which controlled much of the district. He set up a training camp and on the night of 12 February 1965 led about 200 supporters into Fort Johnston to attack the police station. They then attempted to reach the capital, Zomba, around 100 miles away. Chipembere's exact intentions are unknown, but he may have hoped that the army based in Zomba would come out in support of the rising. His small force was stopped at the Liwonde ferry by security forces and, after some fighting, it fled in disorder.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 440‚Äì5. Although there was a reward for his capture, Chipembere was able to remain in the Fort Johnston District until March when, ill with diabetes, he wrote to Jones, the Governor-general offering to leave Malawi in return for an amnesty. Banda at first rejected this, but after Chipembere contacted the US ambassador in early April, it was arranged (with Banda's consent) that he should leave Malawi and travel, through Southern Rhodesia and London, to the USA. He agreed not to plot against Banda there. Chipembere later claimed that an amnesty had been promised for his followers, but many of them were detained and a few continued raids on government targets for some time, leading to retaliatory burning of local villages and the public hanging of one of the leaders in January 1966. Many of Chipembere supporters were Yao and Banda promoted the recruitment of members of the rival Lomwe group as paramilitary police to contain them.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 449. During and after the suppression of Chipembere's armed uprising, several hundred civil servants were sacked, or detained along with other of his supposed supporters, and chiefs suspected of sympathising with him were deposed.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 321. There had been a minor incursion from Tanzania in March 1965 by fighters loyal to Yatuta Chisiza, when two of his fighters were killed. In September 1967, Chisiza himself led a force of less than 20 that had trained in Zambia through Mozambique into the Mwanza District. They were spotted by police on 3 October and nine were captured over the next few days. Chisiza himself was killed in a shoot-out with troops on 11 October and his corpse was publicly displayed on Banda's orders.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 445. The Fates of the Ministers Several of the ministers that fled from Malawi after the Cabinet Crisis died abroad, but a number survived to return to Malawi after Banda was deposed and returned to public life. Several of those that had supported Banda at the time of the cabinet crisis later suffered demotion, dismissal or imprisonment at his hands. One of the new ministers appointed after the Cabinet Crisis in 1964, Albert Muwalo, was hanged for treason in 1976.O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi. Chipembere first studied at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), then taught in Tanzania from 1966 to 1969, before returning to UCLA to complete his doctorate and receive treatment for diabetes. He later taught at the California State University. Between 1970 and 1975, he worked on his autobiography, which was incomplete on his death. He died on 24 September 1975 from complications of his diabetes without returning to Malawi. After Banda was removed in 1993, Chipembere's reputation was rehabilitated.R. I. Rotberg, Chipembere obituary, Harvard Magazine May‚ÄìJune 2010. http://harvardmagazine.com/2010/05/vita-masauko-chipembere Chiume was in exile in Tanzania from 1964 to 1994, where he became active in journalism and set up a political movement aimed at promoting change in Malawi. He returned to Malawi in 1994 after Banda's removal and became chairman of the Malawi National Library Service until he retired in 1996. He then lived in his home district of Nkhata Bay until 2002, when he moved to New York because of his health, and died there on 21 November 2007.Chiume biography http://www.kanyamachiume.com/about.html Orton Chirwa settled in Tanzania, where he taught and practised law. On Christmas Eve 1981, Chirwa, his wife, Vera and their son were abducted from Zambia by Malawian security officials, possibly after being tricked into going to the border area. Two years later Orton and Vera Chirwa were put on trial for treason in a \\"traditional\\" court and not allowed defence counsel. They were found guilty and sentenced to death, but after many appeals for clemency this was commuted to life in prison. Orton Chirwa died in Zomba prison on 20 October 1992, after nearly 11 years in solitary confinement. When he died, he was virtually deaf and blind.Chirwa obituary, Independent 22 October 1992, https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-orton-chirwa-1558842.html Willie Chokani and Augustine Bwanausi left for Zambia in October 1964, where they became schoolteachers. Chokani became a headmaster of a secondary school and a college lecturer before moving to Tanzania where he was active in Malawian exile politics. He returned to Malawi in 1993 and was Malawi's Ambassador to the US from 1994 to 1999, then Ambassador to Ethiopia and High Commissioner to Namibia before his retirement. Bwanausi remained as a teacher in Zambia until his death in a car accident in 1973.O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi. After her dismissal as parliamentary secretary and from the Women's League, Rose Chibambo resigned as an MP and joined her husband who was in the district administration of Chiradzulu and later Mwanza, but after threats from MCP members, they both fled to Zambia in early 1965. Her husband died in Zambia in 1968, but she survived to return to Malawi in 1994.J Power, (2010). Political Culture and Nationalism in Malawi, p. 187. Msonthi took over Chipembere's former post as Minister for Education, and served in several cabinet posts until his removal on charges of breaching MCP party discipline in 1973. He was internally exiled to his home district for five years, before partial rehabilitation and being given a post in a government parastatal, which he held until his death in 1982.C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964‚Äì1965 p. 179. Aleke Banda, who had become Secretary-General of MCP in 1962, became a cabinet minister in 1962, and served in three cabinet posts before being dismissed by Banda in 1973. In 1975, he was appointed managing director of Press Holdings Ltd, a company controlled by Banda but in 1979 was detained without charge for 12 years. After Banda's removal, he re-entered politics in opposition to MCP, and between 1997 and 2005 held two cabinet posts. He retired through illness in 2005 and died from leukaemia in 2010. John Tembo ceased to be a cabinet minister in 1971, becoming Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi but retaining his MCP position. In 1982, Tembo left the Reserve Bank and, although he held no ministerial office until 1989, he was a close advisor to Banda and held a number of posts in parastatal bodies. In 1989, he became MCP treasurer and again held ministerial office. In 1995 he was accused, along with Banda of murder, but acquitted. After 1994, Tembo remained with MCP and in politics, and is currently Malawi's Leader of the Opposition.O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi.

Like traditional schools, studio schools teach the National Curriculum and offer academic and vocational qualifications. However, studio schools also have links to local employers and offer education related to the world of work. Twenty studio schools will have closed by the summer of 2018; the introduction of studio schools has been widely criticised . Description Studio schools are a type of Free School, introduced in 2010. They are part of the Academies Programme, and are funded by the taxpayer, non-selective, free to attend and not controlled by a local education authority. While this is also true of most other academies and free schools, studio schools are collectively distinctive in a number of ways. Studio schools are sponsored by existing schools, colleges, and community groups. However, existing schools cannot convert to become a studio school - all studio schools have to be stand alone schools with no direct transfer intake of pupils. Studio schools are designed to be small, with a maximum of 300 students, which enables them to foster a supportive, personalised learning environment with a strong focus on pastoral care. The schools forge close links with businesses and enterprises in their specialist industries who support the schools through activities such as mentoring, work placements, and curriculum design and delivery. To further prepare students for the world of work, employability skills are embedded throughout all school activities using the CREATE employability skills framework. Like University Technical Colleges, studio schools are designed for students aged 14‚Äì19, whereas free schools and other academies can choose the age range of their pupils. Some studio schools, which operate in areas with a three-tier school system, have intakes for students aged 13. The name 'Studio School' is derived from the concept of the Renaissance studio which existed in Europe from 1400 to 1700. Students at these studios were taught by an experienced master in the same place in which the master created and produced his work. Modern-day studio schools aim to give students skills required by employers and businesses in the local area, in an environment which simulates genuine workplaces. As part of this, studio schools are open all year round and have a longer school day, typically 9am to 5pm. The Studio Schools programme as a whole is overseen by the Studio Schools Trust, who are responsible for helping in the establishment of new studio schools, and supporting existing schools to implement the model. Part of this work involves facilitating the sharing of best practice through networking sessions and training and CPD events. Businesses involved with the Studio Schools programme include National Space Centre, Talk Talk, Barclays, National Nuclear Laboratory, and National Trust. History The establishment of studio schools has been criticised by some teaching unions, who claim they will cause further fragmentation state school provision. The age intake range of studio schools have also been criticised, with some unions arguing that 14 is too early an age for most children to receive such a specialised education. In March 2016, it emerged that of the forty-seven studio schools that had been established, fourteen had closed or were closing. Six new studio schools were scheduled to open. By April 2018, nineteen schools had closed at a cost estimated at ¬£48m, with another due to close in the summer. Free schools, introduced in 2010, include studio schools and university technical colleges; sixty-six free schools had closed by April 2018, at an estimated cost of almost ¬£150m in startup costs and capital funding. The joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU) said \\"The government should hang its head in shame at this monumental waste of taxpayers‚Äô money at a time when schools are severely underfunded\\". In 2017, academies minister Lord Nash conducted an informal review of the studio schools concept due to low pupil recruitment and closures. As of 2018, almost half of the Studio Schools so far started, twenty-seven of fifty-six, had closed or were closing.

The biggest achievements of his career were becoming the champion of the 2013 Red Bull X-Fighters world tourAn Unforgettable Night: Pag√®s aces best run ever to win world tour title and winning the gold medal at X Games Austin 2015 in the Toyota Moto X QuarterPipe competition for his Bike Flip.X Games Austin 2015 Toyota Moto X QuarterPipe results Biography =Early life= Pag√®s was born in Nantes, France, to parents Genevi√®ve and Olivier as the youngest of three brothers. In the 1990s his parents purchased and renovated a house in the French countryside where they had plenty of space to experiment with all sorts of sports. He rode his first real motorcycle when he was 15 years old, stating that he had his first motorcycle of sorts with 19 months. =Early career and hiatus (2005‚Äì2009)= Together with his brother Charles he started with BMX racing where they suffered their first fractures of collarbones and knees along with some broken teeth. They soon went on to ride their BMXs in dirt and in order to achieve even higher jumps then switched to motor bikes. They had ridden motocross bikes on tracks before, but only built their first ramp in 2005. Pag√®s rode at his first freestyle show very soon after his first attempts at La Bosse de Bretagne in July 2005, though he states that his best memories stem from Bercy in 2006. He and his brother had only really been racing on their motocross bikes before receiving their invitation for the event, but showed up on the day being able to perform all the tricks of that time, including the backflip. In November 2007, Pag√®s became the first person to land a Double Grab Backflip on dirt, which he repeated at MXWC in April 2008, where he came in second in the Best Trick competition. The same year he and his brother were the first riders to catch frontflips on film and he then went on to be the first person to ever attempt a frontflip in a Freestyle Motocross competition at the Red Bull X-Fighters tour stop in Fort Worth, Texas in June 2009, but backed out in mid-air resulting in a crash from which he stood up immediately.ESPN profile of Thomas Pag√®s Later in 2009, Pag√®s got frustrated with the face of the competition and the constant need to perform backflips, ultimately resulting in him quitting Freestyle Motocross and even selling his bike. In a documentary that was released by Red Bull in 2014, Tom said that he had developed depression during that time and it took the help of a renowned sports psychologist to overcome it and to get back onto a bike. His psychologist was also the person who suggested that he stop backflipping and instead focus on the tricks which he enjoyed performing. While objecting at first, Pag√®s further thought about the idea and ultimately decided to give it a try by performing so-called ‚Äúnew age tricks‚Äù that hardly any or no other riders were performing at that time, developing his own tricks and by going back to the roots of Freestyle Motocross with whips and classical right-side-up tricks. =Return to freestyle motocross (2010)= One of the first tricks he mastered was the Volt body varial which he first performed in a competition at Bercy motocross 2010. Having been under the impression that he had to better his brother's performance, Charles attempted a frontflip which he over-rotated, resulting in a crash that mostly affected his head. Tom later said that his brother had a cut under his eye that had blood rushing out of it. Charles was in coma for a week and had to learn daily tasks, such as writing, completely from scratch as his motor functions were strongly limited. Part of that was him going to circus school where he redeveloped his athletic abilities. As of 2012, Charles is back riding his bike, but not yet in a competition.Profile at RedBullXFighters.com As Tom was the only source for financial income for the brothers, who had a house together in South France, near Hossegor, he went back to riding shows and demos and worked more intensely on a comeback to competition. =Return to Red Bull X-Fighters (2012)= Despite being invited from time to time, Pag√®s never returned to Red Bull X-Fighters until he was certain that he could be successful on the circuit, which was finally the case in 2012 when he came back for the second tour stop of the year in Glen Helen, California. Upon his return to Freestyle Motocross competitions he still refused to do any upside down tricks like backflips, but instead focussed on bringing in his new tricks, like the Volt body varial, the 540 Flair or his very own Special Flip, and on the execution and extension in existing tricks. He became a runner up at his first event in Glen Helen, coming in fourth in Madrid and finally winning his first ever Red Bull X-Fighters event in Munich, Germany. That season he went on to battle Levi Sherwood in the closest ever final of Red Bull X-Fighters in Sydney, Australia, with both riders going into the last tour stop sharing first place in the world tour. He crashed twice on his final run, doing the Volt and attempting the first backflip, an Indy Flip, since 2009 which he jumped with the wrong gear, in a head-to-head competition against Sherwood, who went on to win the final and the 2012 Red Bull X-Fighters world tour. =2013= Only a few days before the start of the 2013 season, Japan‚Äôs rider Eigo Sato, who was a good friend of Pag√®s‚Äô, died after crashing a backflip in training, leaving behind wife and children. Pag√®s, along with several other riders, started an initiative to collect money to support his family. He later changed the designs of his bikes, jersey and helmets in memory of his deceased friend. Pag√®s won the first event of the 2013 Red Bull X-Fighters world tour in Mexico City, Mexico in a final against Dany Torres of Spain, wearing a signed jersey of Sato's. At the next tour stop in Dubai he was re-beaten by Sherwood in the semi-finals after crashing an Indian Air backflip, who then lost in the finals against Torres. He was the runner up in Glen Helen, where the finals had to be cancelled due to high winds and the qualifying results were announced as being final. During the qualifying, which was not broadcast, he showed a variation of the 540 Flair, combining it with a Superman. At the fourth tour stop in Osaka, Japan, where he instead showed a 540 Flair Indian Air variation, he was again the runner up, losing this time to hometown hero Taka Higashino, while the judges‚Äô decision was heavily debated. The day of the event in Madrid on 19 July it was announced that the last tour stop in Pretoria, South Africa had to be cancelled as the safety of riders, staff and audience could not be guaranteed. After Josh Sheehan, his quarter-final opponent, had to pull out due to a fractured collarbone and ankle, which he suffered in a crash at the end of his second qualifying run, it was clear that Pag√®s had won the 2013 Red Bull X-Fighters world tour as he would at least come in third place and therefore had more points than any other rider could have achieved. Even though he didn‚Äôt even have to compete to win the world tour he went on to win his semi- final against fellow Frenchman David Rinaldo and the final against Taka Higashino. At this event the fans finally got the see the Superman variation of the Flair while it is said that he also did a Kiss of Death Flair during the qualifying, which would be an even further stretched-out version of the Flair Superman. Also during the qualifying as well in both his semi-final and final runs he successfully landed Cliffhanger backflips, finally breaking the curse of his former attempts. To the astonishment of both the crowd and the commentators, he announced in an on-air interview after his victory that he had not pulled out every trick during the 2013 season. =2014= For the 2014 season Pag√®s changed his appearance, this time wearing a bright multi-coloured jersey and pants along with a new helmet design, both of which re-featured parts to remember Eigo Sato. Sato's signature is featured on the new helmet while a \\"R.I.P. Eigo Sato\\" design is placed next to his own name on the back of his jersey. On another helmet that he introduced later in the year, Sato's counterfeit is featured as the main design element on top of the helmet. The 2014 Red Bull X-Fighters world tour did not start off as comfortable as 2013 did for Pag√®s. On leaving the ramp to perform his Volt body varial during his quarter-final run, a head-to-head competition against Adam Jones, the bike slightly leaned forward, making it impossible to complete the trick, resulting in a Dead Sailor (a jump without a trick). Later in the same run he crashed on his 540 Flair Superman variation and only put in a few more jumps for the audience, being out of contention to advance to the semi-finals anyway. Having come in third in the qualifying he still secured fifth place and therefore 45 points for the overall ranking.Red Bull X-Fighters Mexico 2014 report According to Pag√®s this was the result of him not being able to train as much as he'd liked to because of France's rainy weather. The event commentators also said that during a chat with Pag√®s earlier in the week, he'd said that he had to change the way he executes most of his tricks because the bike loses power in the high altitude of Mexico City. This was especially apparent in moves like the Flair where he would usually use the bike's power to start off the rotation, whereas with less power he had to use much more muscle force to induce the 540 degree twist of the bike. It is noteworthy that among the top three riders that night, only tour stop winner Levi Sherwood was riding a 250ccm bike (KTM SX 250), though it is known that he makes many alterations so the power is closer to that of a 350ccm bike. Second-placed Josh Sheehan rides a Honda CRF 450 and Dany Torres in 3rd rides a KTM SX 350. The next event, which took place in Osaka, Japan, went even worse for Pag√®s. After riding in practises and the qualifying, he had to decide that he couldn‚Äôt ride for safety's sake as the dirt was not good enough to perform tricks as dangerous as the 540 Flair, let alone the much talked about Bike Flip. Pag√®s had originally come to Japan with his only goal being to perform the Bike Flip. Because of his qualifying result he was still ranked ninth in the Osaka final results, which granted him 20 points for the overall rankings. The first success of the season then came at the third tour stop in Madrid, Spain. Pag√®s managed to land the Bike Flip in all three rounds, which saw him beat Josh Sheehan in the final, despite Sheehan's flawless performance including a Double Backflip, to achieve his first victory of the season and gain 100 points. The final is considered to have been the greatest and closest ever event final in Red Bull X-Fighters history, with both riders putting down perfect runs including futuristic tricks. The last two events of the season in Munich, Germany and Pretoria, South Africa both ended with a quarter-final exit after Pag√®s crashed at both events in his first run. In Munich he crashed on his second trick already, the Bike Flip, as he pushed the bike too far away from him. He was lucky to remain uninjured as the bike crashed down on him. However, it was damaged beyond immediate repair and Pag√®s was unable to continue his run, therefore losing the round to Germany's Luc Ackermann, a then 17-year-old FMX talent. At the final event, which was also the 50th Red Bull X-Fighters event, he managed to bring in several tricks before crashing an initially landed Flair Tsunami. He didn‚Äôt manage the full 540 degree rotation, instead landing at about 450 degrees, which resulted in him running out of space and the bike dropping down the edge of the landing hill where it got stuck in between the dirt and the quarter pipe. As he came in first and second respectively in the qualifying in those two events, he still ended up in fifth place at both events and secured 45 points each. He ended up in fourth place in the final overall rankings behind new world tour champion Josh Sheehan, Levi Sherwood and Dany Torres with 235 points. =2015= For the 2015 season, Pag√®s debuted a new bike, that he designed together with Yamaha.Gallery: Pag√®s to debut revolutionary new bike at X-Fighters Mexico City Everything about it was designed to be ultra-light, reaching a total weight of only 100 kg, while it also has increased power. However, while that bike clearly offers advantages for Freestyle Motocross, the new design also makes it harder to handle, as it is easier moved off course in mid-air. Pag√®s started the 2015 Red Bull X-Fighters season with a quarter-final victory against Adam Jones before then losing to eventual winner Clinton Moore in the semi-finals of the Mexico City event on 6 March. It is notable that he did not show either the Bike Flip, which he debuted at the 2014 Madrid tour stop, nor his newest trick, the Alley-Oop Flair, that he announced to the public in a YouTube video on 25 February 2015,Tom Pag√®s 540 Alley-Oop Flair on YouTube while Moore threw down a Volt, a near-perfect flatspin 540 Flair and the Bundy, a trick he invented himself and which is roughly comparable to Kyle Loza‚Äôs Electric Doom.Red Bull X-Fighters Mexico City 2015 Results The next big event of Pag√®s' 2015 was X Games Austin 2015 where he won his first ever X Games gold medal in the Toyota Moto X QuarterPipe competition. He initially planned on doing first the Bike Flip and then the Alley-Oop Flair, but after crashing on the Bike Flip on his first try, he gave it another shot which he landed with little difficulties and received a total of 95.33 points. At the second X-Fighters event of the year at the Dionysos Marble Quarry in Athens, Greece Pag√®s put down a near-perfect quarter-final run, including the Bike Flip, the Alley-Oop Flair and a Flair off of a dirt jump, to beat last year's tour champion Josh Sheehan. In his semi-final bout against David Rinaldo he initially landed the Alley-Oop Flair, his first jump of the run, before falling down in the slippery dirt. He got back onto his bike and still went on to beat Rinaldo in four categories, only losing the execution point, in a world's first. Never before had a rider won in head-to-head competition in Red Bull X-Fighters after a crash. However, yet another Bike Flip crash cost him the final in which his opponent was again Clinton Moore, who took home his second consecutive victory. Pag√®s' first victory of the 2015 season then came in Madrid, where he bagged his third consecutive win in this venue, also a record that no rider had accomplished before him. He beat Australian rider Rob Adelberg in the quarter finals, before re-defeating his fellow Frenchman in the semis. Crashes from Josh Sheehan and Clinton Moore meant that Levi Sherwood went on to be his final opponent, having lain down perfect runs before that, but falling victim to the soft dirt on the quarter pipe landing where he fell after a masterful showcase of his Superman transfer flip. With that, Pag√®s only had to lay down a good run, but upped his game by adding a Bike Flip to his already impressive arsenal of tricks of the night, and finishing off with his signature Tsunami Indy. In all three rounds, Pag√®s has not been beaten in one single category. His first victory was soon to be followed by a second at the fourth and penultimate stop of that year's Red Bull X-Fighters world tour in Pretoria, South Africa, Both took place in front of the Union Buildings. Pag√®s put down three near-perfect runs after winning qualifying the day prior to beat David Rinaldo in the quarter-finals, Josh Sheehan in the semi-finals and then finally Clinton Moore to take the win. With that victory he took first place in they overall rankings alongside Clinton Moore, who will head into the last tour stop with 280 points each.

In 1938 he produced a monograph \\"Tumors of the urinary bladder\\", which was a handbook for surgeons, oncologists and urologists. During Winter War (1939‚Äì1940) Shapiro was Senior Consultant Urologist for evacuation hospitals of Leningrad. Upon the German invasion of Soviet Union (1941) he became a consultant urologist at the Northern Front, and from 1942 to 1945 a chief urologist for evacuation hospitals of the People's Commissariat for Health. His report \\"Gunshot wounds of the urinary and genital System\\" on 1941 All-Union conference of surgeons was a breaking news.

The game was developed by Australia's 5 Lives Studios and is a spiritual successor to the Syndicate series, which co-founder and programmer Mike Diskett had worked on. Development After the release of the Syndicate reboot in 2012, the Syndicate Wars producer and lead programmer, Mike Diskett, expressed his displeasure over the game's lack of similarity to previous entries in the series: > \\"A lot of Syndicate fans, including myself, got our hopes up when we heard a > new Syndicate game was in development, but in the end it turned out to be > nothing like the original games.\\" This encouraged him to create the Brisbane-based 5 Lives Studios (which included team members who had worked on other video game series such as Grand Theft Auto, L.A. Noire, and Darksiders) and develop a spiritual successor to the game he made back in 1996: > \\"I've decided to take it upon myself to deliver what the fans really > wanted.\\" Unlike the reboot, which was a first-person shooter, 5 Lives Studios tried to build upon the real-time tactics gameplay experience found in the original games by introducing a fixed camera system and character classes. On June 28, 2013, Satellite Reign was announced on crowdfunding website Kickstarter with a (US$546,875) goal. On July 29, 2013, the project was successfully funded with (US$720,832) raised. The game was released for Windos, macOS, and Linux on August 28, 2015. A post-launch update introducing four-player cooperative gameplay was released in July 2016. Plot Satellite Reign takes place in an unnamed fictional city referred to as \\"The City\\". A corporation named Dracogenics rises to prominence after releasing a prototype named Resurrection-Tech that is capable of providing immortality. Dracogenics turns to corporate crime and bribes politicians with immortality in exchange for control and influence. This eventually leads to the privatization of The City's services and full corporate control over The City's police force. Civil unrest arises and is suppressed by Dracogenics, but a rival corporation soon comes to light and launches anti-Dracogenics attacks. The player controls this rival corporation and must overthrow Dracogenics from The City.

She was also known for her turbulent lifestyle attracting the attention of the Czech tabloid media.  Biography and career  Barto≈°ov√° was born in ƒåeladn√° and spent her childhood and adolescence in Fren≈°t√°t pod Radho≈°tƒõm. She has an older brother Lum√≠r and twin sister Ivana. She started her musical career in 1982, with the band Dianthus. In 1983, she succeeded in a music competition held in Jihlava and met the singer Petr Sep√©≈°i, with whom she later collaborated and started a relationship. Sep√©≈°i died in a car accident in 1985. In the second half of the 1980s, she began collaborating with notable exponents of Czech pop music, such as Franti≈°ek Janeƒçek and Ladislav ≈†taidl, her life partner for many years. In 1987, she released her first solo album I.B., for which she received an award from her record label, Supraphon. In 1993, she starred in the comedy Svatba up√≠r≈Ø. In 1996, she gave birth to a son. A year later, she appeared in her first musical production, Dracula. In the late 1990s, she released several successful albums, such as Ve jm√©nu l√°sky and B√≠l√Ω k√°men. With the start of the new millennium, her popularity decreased, partly due to scandals surrounding her personal life. In 2006, she announced a 'creative break'. She spent part of 2007 in a psychiatric hospital in Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ, where she was treated for addiction to antidepressants and alcohol. In 2008, EMI released a 3‚ÄìCD compilation of her greatest hits, called Platinum Collection. In 2009, she won the TV poll in the T√ΩT√Ω Awards.

Some fellow musicians pointed out that the hunt of the tabloid media against the singer had its share of tragedy. \\"Blame it on the media hyenas\\", her husband commented shortly before he collapsed and was hospitalized.  Barto≈°ov√° and the tabloid media  Iveta Barto≈°ov√° was one of the most-discussed personalities in the Czech tabloid media. According to the musical producer Old≈ôich Lichtenberg, she \\"has become a victim of people who surrounded her and only try to profit from her\\". On the other hand, the psychologist Jeron√Ωm Klime≈° pointed out in the Slovak newspaper SME that Barto≈°ov√° knowingly and voluntarily participated in the media circus concerning her personal life. \\"She plays the story with all of us, however, she doesn't have the performance under control\\", he said. In the article Mil√Ω n√°rode, Iveta Barto≈°ov√° nen√≠ vƒõc (Dear Nation, Iveta Barto≈°ov√° Is Not a Thing), published by the newspaper Lidov√© noviny, journalist Tom√°≈° Bald√Ωnsk√Ω noted that the Czech tabloid media changes a human being into a human 'thing' and compared the public attention to the Barto≈°ov√° troubles to a vulture watching her dying with a grin. In 2013 Pavel Novotn√Ω, the chief editor of the website Extra.cz and a well known tabloid journalist, remarked \\"Of course, we will kill her. But she's killing herself as well ... It is a fact that we've parasitized her for years ...\\". Novotn√Ω stated that the public demand is so huge that even the people who don't read tabloids search and read articles about her: \\"In such a case, there are no borders and we will parasitize her until the end and even half a year after that. It's hard and morally wrong but that's how it is.\\" In July 2013, when she was hospitalized, 745,000 people (7% of the Czech population) watched the \\"Night News\\" special about her.

Hart and Jane Novak. Hart plays three roles in the film. Plot As described in a film magazine, pioneer Ben Trego (Hart) sends his twin baby sons on the trail while he turns to fight Indians in the wilds of Utah. When they close in on him, he commits suicide by igniting a keg of gunpowder, slaying several of the assailants in the explosion. His sons are picked up by riders who take them to the nearest settlement where they are adopted by different families. One of the boys (both played by Hart) becomes a rancher known as the Three Word Brand due to his sparsity of speech while the other becomes governor of the state. Neither knows of the other. The rancher is in partnership with George Barton (Bingham) who is accused of murder, but Brand believes in his innocence. At the same time Governor Marsden has been asked to sign a water bill which will deprive the ranchers in the valley of their supply of water. The governor decides to visit the valley and is seen by Brand, who notices the resemblance and hatches a plan to free his partner of the murder charge. Brand has his foreman lead the governor on false trails for several days while he goes to the capital and takes the executive's place. While masquerading as the governor Brand vetoes the water rights bill and signs a pardon for his partner Barton. Meanwhile the governor is wounded on the ranch, where he is mistaken for Brand. Brand returns and the two twins meet. The reunion gives Brand a chance to confound his enemies and also convinces his partner's sister Ethel (Novak) that he is worthy of marriage. Cast * William S.

Pochon exposes the virtues of straw, mixed with animal excrement, that produces farmyard manure unlike Factory farming that produces liquid manure. The latter has much lower agronomic properties and poses spreading problems. In Pochon's opinion: * farmers that follow this method have equal or superior economic performance to \\"conventional\\" farmers, although they receive lower grants from the Common Agricultural Policy * this method has much higher environmental performances: farmers consume much less pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers. * these experiments demonstrate the economic viability of environment friendly alternatives.  Pochon's farming best practices  * Respecting the balance between soil, plants, animals: an agricultural area should have enough crops to feed his cattle (avoiding too much food imports) and enough livestock to \\"recycle\\" the straws as farmyard manure. * A systematic rotation of crop based on prairies (three-quarters of the plots must be prairies) with plants adapted to the climate. * Breeding on straw exclusively, no factory farming to avoid liquid manure and taking into account animal welfare.

Whitehorn was born in a sod house in Spencer, Nebraska, on the prairie, the son of a farmer and part-time school teacher. He graduated from Doane College in Crete, Nebraska, and won a scholarship to attend Harvard University Medical School. He graduated in 1921 and began his residency at the McLean Hospital in Waverley, Massachusetts. In 1938, Whitehorn was hired to lead the Department of Psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he remained for three years. He moved to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland as the Henry Phipps Professor of Psychiatry, succeeding Dr. Adolf Meyer. Whitehorn became Professor Emeritus in 1961. In 1955, Whitehorn described his philosophy and methods of psychiatry in his Salmon lectureship of the New York Academy of Medicine, later published under the title Psychiatric Education and Progress. He was active in developing psychiatry curricula for undergraduate education and graduate education programs for psychiatric medical training. Among his private papers stored at the American Psychiatric Association (APA) was a note describing how he was collected blood from patients for a study on humoral changes and emotion. He talked with the patients and over time it became apparent that the patients with whom he developed a relationship improved clinically. His interest in the process of psychotherapy developed into a research study with Barbara Betz, M.D. The research study was published in 1975 under the title Effective Psychotherapy with The Schizophrenia Patient. The study showed that psychiatrists who took an active role in psychotherapy with schizophrenia patients were three times more successful in their patients' clinical improvement than passive psychotherapists. Whitehorn received numerous honorary degrees: an LHD from Doane College (1947), D.Sc. from the University of Nebraska (1955), and a Sc.D. from the University of Rochester (1971). Other awards presented to Whitehorn included the Hamilton medal of the American Psychopathological Association (1953), the Gutheil Medal of the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy (1961), the Bowis medal of the American College of Psychiatry (1967), and the Salmon Medal of the New York Academy of Medicine (1971).

Found by an unknown person or persons, most of the hoard was illegally sold or given away. Remaining items of the hoard were found later at the mound, and were turned over to the landowner, General Philip Durham. The surviving 170 piece hoard now is in the National Museum of Scotland. The treasure consists mostly of hacksilver and includes four complete silver pieces. Description Norrie's Law Hoard Norrie's Law hoard is one of the largest Pictish hoards ever to be found. The hoard originally contained of late Roman and Pictish silver. Less than of the hoard remains. Consisting of 170 pieces of primarily hacksilver, the treasure also contains complete silver metalwork, including a penanular brooch, a leaf- shaped oval plaque with Pictish symbols, a large hand-pin, and a worn spiral finger-ring. Incomplete items include part of a Roman spoon, pieces of silver sheet from a plate and incomplete spiral bracelets. The hoard's pieces of cut and folded silver were used for their silver bullion value and were often traded or recycled into new objects. The hoard also contained two Late Roman coins which were melted down and sold soon after the initial discovery. History The hoard was found in 1819 by an unknown discover or discoverers at a small tumulus known as Norrie's Law, which is located on the Largo Estate in Fife. The mound was built of stones and sat on an elevated bank of sand and gravel. The discovery occurred while the anonymous finder(s) were digging sand at the base of the mound. The silver found at the site was given to a peddler who later sold most of the items as scrap silver to be melted down. Some of the items were given away. The landowner, General Durham, learned of the hoard after most of the silver had been sold off. He was able to locate the remaining items of the hoard that had not been uncovered in the first excavation. Durham kept the discovery of the treasure secret for 20 years. In 1839 a local antiquarian, George, Buist, investigated local accounts of the hoard and published an account of the discovery for the local archaeological society. Buist had pewter copies made of two objects from the hoard, the decorated plaque and the large hand-pin. General Durham died in 1845 without descendants. The Largo estate passed to Lilas Dundas Calderwood Durham (Mrs Robert Dundas of Arniston), who donated most of the surviving hoard pieces to the Museum of Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, now the National Museum of Scotland in 1864. The remainder of the hoard was donated to the museum by her heir, Robert Dundas of Arniston in 1883. The fourth century Roman coins from the hoard suggest that it must have been buried sometime after the early fifth century AD. More recent research conducted by the Glenmorangie Research Project at the National Museum of Scotland date the hoard to the sixth century AD. The study also determined that two silver copies of the hoard items were made around 1839. The silver copies of the Pictish-decorated plaque and large hand-pin, were believed until recently to be original early medieval metalwork.

It is located at the mouth of the Etobicoke Creek on Lake Ontario in the Long Branch neighbourhood. Marie Curtis Park was built after the devastating floods of Hurricane Hazel in 1954 destroyed 56 homes and cottages on the site, leaving 1,868 persons homeless and 81 dead. It is named after Marie Curtis, the reeve of Long Branch at the time of its construction. Long Branch at the time was a separate village; it's now amalgamated into the City of Toronto government. Geography The park is located on both sides of Etobicoke Creek, south of Lakeshore Road/Lake Shore Boulevard West. The park's western boundary is the municipal boundary between Toronto on the east and Mississauga to the west. The boundary is just west of the dog off-leash area. When the boundary was established, Etobicoke Creek had a riverbed to the west of its present course. To the immediate west is Mississauga's Lakeshore Park, a former industrial site. The park is a mostly deciduous forest with areas of meadow, savannah, thicket, woodland, plantation, with a shallow marsh, some sand dunes and sand beaches on either side of the creek mouth. A trail passes through the park from east to west, crossing the creek via a bridge. The river bank is landscaped with man-made materials where it meets Lake Ontario. Some of the alder trees on-site are estimated to be over 150 years old.https://nowtoronto.com/news/marie-curtis-park-east-beach/ Facilities The park has a playground, wading pool, a two-colour children's labyrinth with a push-button activated spiral water fountain, a public swimming beach, a dog off-leash area, picnic spots and walking trails. The walking trails are part of the larger Martin Goodman Trail and Waterfront Trail network of trails along the Lake Ontario shore. On the western bank is a boat launching area and parking lot. Children's water play area =Beach= The public swimming beach is located on the east bank of the Etobicoke Creek mouth. The beach is monitored from June to Labour Day by the City of Toronto for safe swimming as e.coli bacteria levels rise after rain-storms. It closes after major rainstorms until levels dissipate. The beach is the westernmost of the eleven beaches in Toronto and the one that is most frequently too polluted for swimming. It is not one of the Toronto beaches which are part of the Blue Flag program. At the beach is a mounted 32-pounder cannon manufactured in 1803 by the Carron Company of Falkirk, Scotland. It had come from Quebec City in 1881 to decorate Riverdale Park. History Cottage on Etobicoke Flats in Etobicoke Township, April 7, 1923. In the late 1790s, this land was part of the Toronto Purchase of lands from the Mississaugas First Nation. In the park area, land, including the parklands, was granted to Colonel Samuel Smith, a United Empire Loyalist from New York who fought for Britain in the Revolutionary War. Lakeshore Road was established and Colonel Smith cleared part of the forest and built his house near the mouth of Etobicoke Creek in 1799. Throughout most of the 19th century, the land was agricultural. In the early 1900s, the land along the Lake Ontario shoreline and at the mouth of the creek was subdivided into lots for summer cottages, some of which were built on stilts to protect against frequent flooding along the floodplain. At this time, the creek had two channels surrounding an island just upstream from the mouth of the creek. When the channels met below the island, the creek then did a sharp 90-degree turn before reaching Lake Ontario. The sharp bend in the creek formed a beach bar between the creek and the lake. Both the island and the bar were used by cottagers. By the late 1940s, there were at least 277 residences in what was called the \\"Etobicoke Flats\\". Just to the west of the flats, within today's Lakeshore Park, was a small arms manufacturing company that was constructed during World War II. After its closure in 1976, the property was turned over to the Canada Post Corporation and used as a distribution centre. The office complex and the water tower remain of the buildings on the site, at the foot of Dixie Road. Etobicoke Creek flooded badly on March 16, 1948, forcing the rescue of 110 families. The Long Branch village assessor stated that the homes should be condemned, but would not be due to the lack of replacement housing. This prompted the then Etobicoke River Conservation Authority to make an offer to purchase houses in the area to develop a park with flood controls. Local residents refused to sell. The mouth of Etobicoke Creek was altered in 1949 through the building of the Long Branch Diversion Channel that removed the 90-degree bend and allowed creek water and ice to flow in a straight path into Lake Ontario. Even so, in 1952, an ice jam in the river occurred and destroyed some houses on the flats. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel hit the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and within 24 hours, of rain fell, leading to the death of seven area residents and the destruction of at least 56 residences (numbers for the GTA as a whole were much higher). New flood protection measures led to the government expropriation of 164 properties (at a cost of ($ in dollars)) near the mouth of Etobicoke Creek and the removal of cottages on the flats. The western channel of the creek and the area north of the sand bar was filled in except for a small pond in the area of the west channel. All structures on the sandbar, Island Road and 43rd Street were removed. 43rd Street south of Lake Shore Boulevard and Lakeshore Promenade west of 42nd Street were closed and converted into parkland. Marie Curtis Park opened in 1959. The park was named after Marie Curtis, the then- Reeve of Long Branch for her contributions to municipal service in Long Branch and Metropolitan Toronto. In 1992, the TRCA purchased the lands (the \\"Arsenal Lands\\") of the adjoining former arms factory along Lakeshore Road, with the intent of expanding the amount of parkland at the site. As part of the sale, both TRCA and Canada Post spent million for soil remediation. The TRCA has developed a master plan, and done remediation efforts on the land since then. 70,000 tonnes of contaminated soil was removed and a containment facility for low-level radioactive waste was constructed at a cost of . Development of the Arsenal Lands is ongoing. Park development costs were estimated in 2005 at . =Gay cruising= The park has developed a reputation as a \\"gay cruising\\" location. The activities in the park have attracted police attention on several occasions. Two gay men were arrested in the park in 1982 for indecent assault and indecent exposure. The two were found not guilty. In 2016, the Toronto Police Service conducted a sting operation known as \\"Project Marie\\" in the park. The operation arrested 76 men and two women for a total of 89 by-law infractions, including indecent exposure and engaging in sexual activity. A community event held weeks later, entitled \\"Take Back The Park\\", organized by Mississauga Councillor Jim Tovey, on the site where police alleged men had been engaging in public sexual activity, was crashed by members of Toronto's LGBTQ community. The LGBTQ community compared the sting to 1980s bath-house raids. A group of lawyers offered their services free of charge to fight the tickets. A year later, tickets issued to a dozen men were withdrawn. The Toronto Police Service denied the operation was homophobic, but rather \\"it was an attempt to respond to complaints from some residents about public nudity, indecent exposure and drug and alcohol consumption in the park\\".

The Christian fleet was resoundingly victorious, but for the Aydinids, who had been engaging in piracy since the collapse of Byzantine power, it was only a temporary setback in their rise to prominence.  Background  The collapse of Byzantine power in western Anatolia and the Aegean Sea in the late 13th century, as well as the disbandment of the Byzantine navy in 1284, created a power vacuum in the region, which was swiftly exploited by the Turkish beyliks and the ghazi raiders. Utilizing local Greek seamen, the Turks began to engage in piracy across the Aegean, targeting especially the numerous Latin island possessions. Turkish corsair activities were aided by the feuds between the two major Latin maritime states, Venice and Genoa.ƒ∞nalcƒ±k (1993), pp. 311‚Äì312. In 1304, the Turks of Menteshe (and later the Aydinids) captured the port town of Ephesus, and the islands of the eastern Aegean seemed about to fall to Turkish raiders. To forestall such a calamitous event, in the same year the Genoese occupied Chios, where Benedetto I Zaccaria established a minor principality, while in ca. 1308 the Knights Hospitaller occupied Rhodes. These two powers would bear the brunt of countering Turkish pirate raids until 1329.ƒ∞nalcƒ±k (1993), p. 313.  Battle of Chios and aftermath  In July 1319, the Aydinid fleet, under the personal command of the Aydinid emir Mehmed Beg, set sail from the port of Ephesus. It comprised 10 galleys and 18 other vessels. It was met off Chios by a Hospitaller fleet of 24 ships and eighty Hospitaller knights, under Albert of Schwarzburg, to which a squadron of one galley and six other ships were added by Martino Zaccaria of Chios. The battle ended in a crushing Christian victory: only six Turkish vessels managed to escape capture or destruction.ƒ∞nalcƒ±k (1993), pp. 313, 315. This victory was followed up by the recovery of Leros, whose native Greek population had rebelled in the name of the Byzantine emperor, and by another victory in the next year over a Turkish fleet poised to invade Rhodes.Luttrell (1975), pp. 288‚Äì289. Pope John XXII rewarded Schwarzburg by restoring him to the post of grand preceptor of Cyprus, whence he had been dismissed two years earlier, and promised the commandery of Kos, if he could capture it.  Impact  According to the historian Mike Carr, the victory at Chios was all the more significant because it had been achieved at the initiative of the Hospitallers and the Zaccarias, without any support or funding by other Western powers, most notably the Papacy, which was still embroiled in plans to launch a Crusade to the Holy Land. It did nevertheless influence the strategic calculations of Western powers, and efforts began to form a Christian naval league to counter Turkish piracy. Nevertheless, in the immediate future, the defeat off Chios could not halt the rise of Aydinid power. The Zaccarias were soon after forced to surrender their mainland outpost of Smyrna to Mehmed's son Umur Beg, under whose leadership Aydinid fleets roamed the Aegean for the next two decades, until the Smyrniote crusades (1343‚Äì1351) broke the Aydinid emirate's power.ƒ∞nalcƒ±k (1993), pp. 315‚Äì321.

From the moment of its creation in 1925, this villa aroused the interest of cultivated Riviera society, who was searching for new talent. In a few years, Dierks became one of the most sought-after architects on the Riviera, where he built his reputation. The guestbook of the villa includes such dignitaries of Riviera society as Picasso, Somerset Maugham, No√´l Coward and even the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. History In 1925, the 26-year-old Dierks and his partner, Eric Sawyer (banker and ex-officer in the British army) decided to move to the South of France. Their choice brought them to the Riviera, a decision justified by Dierks‚Äô profession and the growing construction demands by rich Americans in this region. At Th√©oule-sur-Mer, in the Alpes-Maritimes, they discovered an isolated site on a small peninsula on the pointe de l‚ÄôEsquillon with an inaccessible cove and private beach.

Description  ca. 1901 in her celebrated role of Portia in The Merchant of Venice), owner of ch√¢teau de l'Horizon. According to the study published in 2004 in the magazine In situ (publication of the minist√®re fran√ßais de la Culture), Fran√ßois Fray, conservateur du patrimoine, ¬´ La client√®le de l'architecte Barry Dierks sur la C√¥te d'Azur ¬ª, In Situ, revue des patrimoines, n¬∞4, minist√®re de la Culture, mars 2004, read on line (page consulted May 6, 2011) the ch√¢teau de L'Horizon is \\"one of the masterworks of Barry Dierks.\\" Here, the architect created an imposing complex of buildings ‚Äì all standing in perfect harmony with one another ‚Äì consisting of a main building of four stories, annexes, a private port, and gardens designed by Dierks himself ‚Äì which was a hallmark of the architect. The property, which is wedged between the Route du bord de mer (D 6098) and the coast, extends along the coast. Dierks utilized this topography to design a long building of which nearly all of the rooms open to the sea and the horizon, hence the name of the villa. For this reason, the entry fa√ßade ‚Äì visible from the roadway ‚Äì has very few openings: Fr√©d√©ric Mitterrand speaks of a \\"forbidding view from the roadway and the railway tracks\\" but a sumptuous approach from the sea. Fr√©d√©ric Mitterrand, Le festival de Cannes, Paris, Laffont, 2007. Seen from the coast, the extended line of the main building seems to be constructed on the jagged pink rocks. The villa consists of a central corps surrounded by two short wings, all of which are set on a terrace. On the eastern side of the villa, a recessed wing opens, whose joining to the main building forms a square tower. The fa√ßades are of white stucco and pierced by numerous openings which create covered arcaded galleries. The property being on a downward slope, the entry level is on the first floor of sea-side of the villa (the gardens, swimming pool, and the salons frais (garden rooms) are on the ground floor). The entry level is given over entirely by the reception rooms and service areas. The upper floor includes ten bedrooms and seven bathrooms. On the uppermost floor (3rd floor from the entry; 4th floor from the sea-side), which has direct access from the terraces, is a salon and an arcaded loggia The swimming pool, of a size uncommon in 1932, is a long rectangle that extends the length of the main building parallel with the coast and overlooks the sea. This architectural statement, seen from the villa, is spectacular. A white monumental staircase descends from the swimming pool to the coast.

Best known for litigating against companies that damage the environment or injure people, Sacks successfully helped secure a $1.06 billion verdict against ExxonMobil in 2001. The company was found guilty of polluting land with radioactive material and the case is the largest private landowner contamination case in U.S. history. Legal background After earning his Juris Doctor degree from Dickinson School of Law in 1984, Sacks officially began his legal career with a focus on personal injury. His talent for administration was quickly recognized and Sacks started managing numerous legal service plans for large labor unions, one of which was Lodge 5 of the Fraternal Order of Police. In total, Sacks oversaw a membership of more than 50,000 union members and their families. While the firm continued to take on personal injury, medical malpractice, and maritime cases, the doors were also opened to plaintiffs in need of toxic tort and environmental contamination litigation representation. In addition to the new practice areas, a satellite firm was established in New Orleans, LA. This enabled the firm to better serve clients whose land had been contaminated in Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Kentucky. As a pioneer in N.O.R.M. litigation, the firm‚Äôs efforts resulted in the largest single-landowner verdict in the country‚Äôs history. Sacks then went on to help settle a tobacco case for $1.25 billion dollars and to help settle three cases in excess of $200 million with one at $50 million. Sacks Weston Diamond, LLC continues to handle complex litigation and other environmental and toxic tort matters. Later in his career, Sacks went on to represent corporate and governmental clients from Europe, Asia and South America in U.S. courts on matters including antitrust and RICO claims. Sacks is admitted to practice in all Pennsylvania state courts, along with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Third and Sixth Circuits. Additionally, he is a member of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States. Five of his cases have gone before the Supreme Court to date. He is one of the few attorneys in the nation to have handled two cases where the results exceeded $1 billion. In 2015, he was admitted to the Billion Dollar Lawyers Association, a select group of attorneys and law firms with a history of recovering $1 billion or more in single or cumulative verdicts and settlements. Education Sacks received his BA from Grinnell College and his Juris Doctor from the Dickinson School of Law. Lawsuits =ExxonMobil= Sacks was a participating attorney in the landmark verdict against ExxonMobil in 2001.

Examples Most rings that occur in algebraic geometry or number theory are J-2 rings, and in fact it is not trivial to construct any examples of rings that are not. In particular all excellent rings are J-2 rings; in fact this is part of the definition of an excellent ring. All Dedekind domains of characteristic 0 and all local Noetherian rings of dimension at most 1 are J-2 rings. The family of J-2 rings is closed under taking localizations and finitely generated algebras. For an example of a Noetherian domain that is not a J-0 ring, take R to be the subring of the polynomial ring k[x1,x2,...] in infinitely many generators generated by the squares and cubes of all generators, and form the ring S from R by adjoining inverses to all elements not in any of the ideals generated by some xn. Then S is a 1-dimensional Noetherian domain that is not a J-0 ring. More precisely S has a cusp singularity at every closed point, so the set of non-singular points consists of just the ideal (0) and contains no nonempty open sets.

Denied entry to Seward's room by one of the suspicious family members, including the African American ma√Ætre d‚Äô and Frederick, Powell started back down the stairs, but suddenly turned and drew his revolver, pointing it at Frederick‚Äôs forehead. He pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired. Powell then struck Frederick several times with the pistol, and he crumpled to the floor unconscious. Fanny Seward came out of her father's room to see her brother bloody and unconscious on the floor and Powell running towards her. After Powell shoved her aside, he ran to Seward's bed and began stabbing him repeatedly in the face and neck. He missed the first time he swung his knife down, but the third blow sliced open Seward's cheek. The splint on Seward's broken jaw was the only thing that prevented Powell's blade from penetrating Seward's jugular vein. Private George F. Robinson, a soldier assigned to attend the secretary, and Seward's son Augustus, an army officer, tried to drive Powell away. Augustus had been asleep in his room, but was awakened by Fanny's screams of terror. David Herold, a Booth conspirator, waited outside; he had been assigned to guide Powell, who was unfamiliar with the streets of Washington. Hearing Fanny scream, Herold ran away, abandoning Powell. The force of Powell's blows had driven Secretary Seward off the bed and onto the floor behind the bed where Powell could not reach him. Powell fought off Robinson and Augustus, stabbing both Robinson and Augustus in the process, and escaped through the front after stabbing Emerick Hansell, a messenger who was bringing a telegram to Seward. Despite the fact that he was injured, Robinson and Fanny Seward immediately applied first aid to the wounded Secretary of State, stopping his bleeding and saving his life. 1871 Congressional Gold Medal On March 1, 1871, American Congress approved the award of the Congressional Gold Medal to Private (later Major) Robinson, who was credited with fighting off Lewis Powell and saving the life of Secretary of State William Seward on 14 April 1865. Robinson received this specially struck medal, the thanks of Congress and a monetary reward in honor of his bravery. 1871 Robinson Mountain On March 24, 1965 the Maine Legislature resolved to rename May Mountain, on whose slopes Robinson had been raised, to Robinson Mountain.ME_574328_004_Robinson Mountain_leg_1965.pdf References Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Union Army soldiers Category:Congressional Gold Medal recipients Category:People from Hartford, Maine Category:People from Pomona, California Category:People of Maine in the American Civil War Category:1832 births Category:1907 deaths Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery ","title":"George F.

The company's first stores opened on the Goldfields at Forest Creek, at Vaughan Springs in 1861, then in 1882 at nearby Castlemaine. , ...The death occurred on December 24, at the residence of her sister, Mrs Ball, at Jolimont, of Mrs E. Welch, 71, widow of the late Mr William Henry Welch, one of the founders of the well-known drapery business of Ball and Welch Pty. Ltd. Starting about 1861 at Vaughan, then a flourishing mining township, the business was extended to Carlton in the early seventies, with a branch at Castlemaine. In 1882 the partnership was formed into a proprietary company, and ultimately opened in Flinders street in 1899... In 1874 a branch was established in Melbourne in the suburb of Carlton. The large three-storied premises had frontages to Faraday, Drummond and University streets. Eventually an emporium at 180 Flinders Street was designed by architects Reed Smart & Tappin and was completed in 1899 in an American Romanesque style. It was extended in 1911 with the purchase of the adjoining Commercial Travellers' Club. The store occupied around one third of the total block and stretched between Flinders Street and Flinders Lane. The Carlton premises were subsequently used as a warehouse, the original building there partly was destroyed by fire in 1928. The Flinders Street store was one of the first in Melbourne to erect neon outdoor advertising, reportedly visible from the Dandenong Ranges. A Sydney branch operated between 1913 and 1924, and the Castlemaine store was finally closed in 1941. With suburban retail expansion in the 1960s, branches were opened in Frankston, Camberwell, and at Eastland and Southland shopping centres. It also operated a 'Ball & Welch gift store' at the then Melbourne International airport landside terminal in Essendon. In its heyday, the Ball & Welch department store was Melbourne's leading family draper, its A to Z departments including gloves, umbrellas and handkerchiefs, mantles, furniture, mercery, millinery, furs and corsets. At one time 26 assistants were devoted to the sale of lace alone. The upscale department store company Georges Australia Ltd bought Ball & Welch in 1970, closing the stores in 1976 because of declining profits. The Flinders Street store was renovated as Flinders Fair shopping centre in the late 1970s, its fa√ßade (including the Commercial Travellers' Club frontage) were eventually incorporated into the Flindersgate carpark.

In parallel with the participation in the f. 2000, in 1987 and 1988 the team also participates in the sportscar Championship, winning for best result with a victory in 2 hours of Misano.  Italian Superturismo Championship  In 1989 the team participated for the first time at the Italian Superturismo Championship, a championship that will see them appear for more than a decade and will get them results.

The monastery has two churches. According to a local legend, the 'Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God' was built in the 1220s by Stefan Nemanjiƒá (Stefan the First-Crowned), the first king of Serbia while the 'Church of the Archdeacon Stefan' was built by Stephen Uro≈° IV Du≈°an of Serbia in 1351.  Etymology  The name of the monastery is derived from the name of the clan Re≈æeviƒái, one of clans of the Pa≈°troviƒái tribe.  Legends  Monastery was built by Stefan Nemanjiƒá, King of Serbia According to local legends, there was a column in front of a guesthouse on the road between Budva and Petrovac in the Kingdom of Serbia in which a wine vessel full of wine was kept for thirsty passersby. One legend says that Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse drank from this vessel during the First Crusade. According to another legend, Stefan the First-Crowned, the first king of Serbia, drank wine from this wine vessel during his visit to his cousin, Venetian Doge Dandolo. Later, in 1223 or 1226, he allegedly built 'The Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God' () near the guesthouse. In 1351, a church dedicated to Saint Stephen‚Äîthe 'Church of the Archdeacon Stefan' ()‚Äîwas built next to The Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God –∞gainst the order issued by Stephen Uro≈° IV Du≈°an of Serbia during his trip from Dubrovnik to Skadar. The column with wine vessel (kept full by the population of surrounding villages to show their hospitality) survived until the mid 19th century.  History  The monastery was a gathering place for the members of the Pa≈°troviƒái tribe who traditionally held meetings there to make important decisions or to elect their chieftain.

A 6'5\\" forward, Boldt started alongside future Hall of Famers Bill Russell and K. C. Jones as the Dons won their second-consecutive national championship with an unblemished 29‚Äì0 record. He scored 16 points in the 1956 national championship match against Iowa. College career =Junior college= Boldt graduated from Verdugo Hills High School in Tujunga, California before enrolling at Glendale Community College in the fall of 1951. At Verdugo, Boldt scored 1,024 points in 63 career games. He won Most Valuable Player (MVP) or was named to the all- tournament team in \\"most\\" of the tournaments he played in. For a time, Boldt was the nation's leading scorer at the junior college level. He earned All- America honors following his 1950‚Äì51 sophomore season. After graduating from Glendale, Boldt enrolled in the United States Army. He spent one year serving in the military and played on the Army's basketball squad. Boldt made the all- star team, and upon being honorably discharged he went home to California. =San Francisco= In the fall of 1955‚Äì56, Boldt enrolled at USF to play basketball. In his first season, the Dons, led by Russell and Jones, recorded an undefeated season en route to winning the NCAA Tournament. He was a starting forward. Years later, Boldt mentioned how it's been pointed out that he and Michael Jordan both scored 16 points in their respective NCAA national championship games. He said, \\"I had to laugh. I may have got 16 but I wouldn't be talking to anyone if we didn't have Bill Russell playing center and K. C. Jones playing guard for us.\\" The following season, Boldt's senior year in 1956‚Äì57, the USF squad had lost Russell, Jones and other key players due to graduation, so a third straight national championship seemed implausible. The Dons performed surprisingly well, won a third consecutive conference championship, and made it to the Final Four of the 1957 NCAA Tournament. The Dons beat Michigan State in the Third Place consolation game. Early into Boldt's final season, San Francisco's then-NCAA record 60-game winning streak was snapped on December 17, 1956. Coincidentally, the streak had begun exactly two years earlier on December 17, 1954. San Francisco compiled a 60‚Äì7 record in Boldt's two seasons on the team. Professional career and later life Boldt was selected in the 7th round (50th overall) in the 1957 NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons following the conclusion of his collegiate career. He never played in the National Basketball Association, however. Boldt then spent some time playing for the Buchan Bakers in the National Industrial Basketball League (NIBL), where in 1958‚Äì59 he was a Western Conference All-Star. He was also named the All-Star Game MVP after holding Dick Boushka, the NIBL's leading scorer, to only six points (all coming off free throws). After Boldt quit playing basketball, he spent time in the 1970s working as a scout and assistant coach for the American Basketball Association's Los Angeles Stars. He then began his career in business, and in 1984 he entered the coffee industry. Boldt lived in Arcadia, California with his wife when he died after a period of declining health, on January 30, 2015.

He was a leader in building a professional American diplomatic corps, cutting it loose from domestic politics. He was named one of three Great Civil Servants, along with William Hunter, and Alvey Augustus Adee. Early life and education He was born in Taylorsville, Ohio, on October 31, 1870. He attended college in Kentucky, graduating from the Commercial College of the University of Kentucky in 1889. After taking a shorthand course, he became a stenographer and accountant at Peekskill Military Academy while continuing his education. In 1894, he received an LL.B. from Georgetown University; in 1899, he was awarded an LL.M. from Columbian University. Career On June 1, 1892, he was appointed a clerk in the Department of State. Ten years later, he became Chief of the Consular Bureau, then Chief Clerk of the Department. On November 30, 1909, he became Director of the Consular Service, an office created specifically for him, and which he held through June 30, 1924. He helped establish Civil Service reform, leading to the Rogers Act. Carr's most prominent success in bringing professionalism to the foreign service was achieving passage of the Lodge Act of April 1906. It made officers of the Consular Service careerists on regular salaries, rather than amateurs who depended on collecting fees from applications. He worked with President Theodore Roosevelt on the executive order of June 1906 which ended the patronage system of appointing consuls for reasons of domestic politics, and instead required promotions by merit through competitive examinations. Additional laws of 1915 and 1931 created the Division of Foreign Service Personnel, of which Carr was the first chairman. He personally drafted the critical Rogers Act of 1924 which united the two rival services, consular and diplomatic, into an integrated Foreign Service. He helped design the quota system of the Immigration Act of 1924, giving significant powers to consuls to issue immigration visas. The promotion of American commerce was also a high priority, which he emphasized to consuls. He often found himself in opposition to old-line diplomats in the State Department.Bruce W. Jentleson and Thomas G. Paterson, eds. Encyclopedia of US foreign relations. (1997) 1:219. From July 1, 1924 to July 28, 1937, Carr was Assistant Secretary of State. In 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia. Peter Bridges, \\"Mr Carr goes to Prague.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 8.3 (1997): 187-198. He was recalled in 1939, after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia forced the closure of the embassy.

Wide glazed surfaces allow the viewer to admire the Ara Pacis with uniform lighting conditions. The white colour is the trademark of Richard Meier, while the travertine plates decorating part of the building are a consequence of in-progress changes (aluminum surfaces were initially planned), after a design review following controversies with some nostalgia for the previous pavilion that was built in 1938 by the architect Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo. The challenging design of Meier wants to assert itself in the very hearth of the town, becoming a nerve and transit centre. The complex was intended to include a crosswalk with an underpass linking the museum to the Tiber river; presently the underpass design seems to have been abandoned completely.Non si abbatter√† il muretto dell'Ara Pacis arriva lo stop della soprintendenza Lilli Garrone on the Corriere della Sera History The building, designed by architect Richard Meier, was inaugurated and opened to the public after seven years of works, on April 21, 2006 (the anniversary of the traditional date of the foundation of Rome). During the night of May 31, 2009, unknown persons defaced the white outer wall with green and red paint and placed a toilet bowl at the foot of the wall. On December 12, 2009, a group of activists of Earth First!, during the Copenhagen Summit, colored the water of the fountain green and affixed on the side facing Via Tomacelli a banner saying \\"Earth First! Act Now\\". The officers and the employees of the museum intervened immediately, removing the banner and emptying the fountain. Criticisms The building has attracted conflicting opinions. (open access) The New York Times judged it a flop, while the famous art critic and polemicist Vittorio Sgarbi called it, \\"A Texas gas station in the very earth of one of the most important urban centres in the world\\", and the first step towards an \\"internationalisation\\" of the city of Rome. Nonetheless, opinion was not unanimous at all and, for instance, Achille Bonito Oliva praised Meier's design.Interview granted to TG3 the day after the declarations of the Mayor Gianni Alemanno. In November 2013 a faulty roof allowed water to leak into the building during heavy rain. Staff members had to use buckets to remove water from the top of the altar. During one of his first declarations after being elected Mayor of Rome (April 2008), Gianni Alemanno announced his intention to remove Meier's building, on the grounds that the Roman right wing had always disapproved. However, Alemanno himself later pointed out that the removal was not a priority of his administration.Non si abbatter√† il muretto dell'Ara Pacis arriva lo stop della soprintendenza Lilli Garrone on Corriere della Sera Notes Bibliography *Sebastiano Brandolini. 2008.

A practicing physician in the infectiology department of the Raymond Poincar√© University Hospital of Garches (directed by Prof. Christian Perronne, AP-HP), University lecturer Emeritus, he led the treatment program ICCARRE that proposes a dramatic reduction of weekly anti-HIV drug intake, down to 2-3 anti-viral pills a day taken 2 to 3 or 4 days a week, as opposed to the presently recommended seven days a week, as still universally prescribed. These reduced medical dosages are adequate, necessary and sufficient according to the results of his exploratory clinical research carried out since 2003.

He acquired his initial experience in research in 1962 at the Bellevue Hospital of New York, later returning to the United States for a Post-doctoral research program at Harvard Medical School (Pr John David, Robert Brigham Hospital, Boston, 1970‚Äì1972), where he studied cellular immunology.Entretien avec Jacques Leibowitch r√©alis√© par J.-F. Picard en mai 2001 sur le site histrecmed On his return to Paris, he finished his internship and went on to research Human Complement Biology at the Royal Hammersmith Hospital, London as post-graduate medical registrar (Pr Keith Peters, 1973‚Äì74), before undertaking his senior residency in nephrology at Necker, entering the Raymond Poincar√© hospital at Garches as immunology assistant lecturer (1980). Jacques Leibowitch published many articles in international scientific journals.International scientific journals Scientific and medical contributions The contributions of Jacques Leibowitch have marked the history of HIV and AIDS and their treatment:Les contributions de Jacques Leibowitch Pour en finir avec le sida, sur le site de Patrick Vallas. Consult√© le 1/10/2013 * In 1982, he expounded the hypothesis that an exotic CD4 trope retro-virus might be at the origin of the growing AIDS epidemic and put the Montagnier and de Gallo teams on the track of the virus * From 1984 to 1985, he removed from the Cochin hospital blood transfusion center the HIV contaminated blood samples, using a test quickly developed under the urgency of the situation by Dr Dominique Mathez, Leibowitch's main collaborator at the Raymond Poincar√© hospital at Garches, anticipating the large-scale screening tests. * Leibowitch and Dr. Mathez developed a home-made biological assay system to measure precisely the levels of active virus in the patient before and under treatment, demonstrating the both meager and transient effectiveness of the antiviral AZT as monotherapy. * He is the father in Europe of the first anti-HIV treatments combining three anti-viral molecules (tri-therapy treatment) for the long-term control of HIV in the correctly treated patient. * From 2003 to 2014, he has shown that after a minimum six-month period on conventional 7 day-a-week \\"attack\\" treatment, weekly anti-viral drug intake could be reduced by 40% to 80%, while maintaining optimal control over the patient's HIV. =Discovery of the HIV retro-virus= Jacques Leibowitch was at the center of the research on AIDS since the original outbreak of the epidemic, from the very moment when the investigation on its causative agent was launched. When the first series of AIDS cases in the United States were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet in December 1981, Leibowitch noticed the similarity between the cases described in the United States and the historic case of a multiple-opportunistic infection syndrome in a Portuguese resident in Paris who had spent time in Angola and Mozambique between 1973 and 1976. He was then contacted by Willy Rozenbaum in March 1982 to set up the informal French Working Group SIDA, a self-nominated body to analyse the cases appearing in France. When in July 1982, the first cases of AIDS appeared in hemophiliacs receiving highly filtered blood samples, the scientific community realized that AIDS was most likely caused by a virus. Jacques Leibowitch noticed some intriguing similarities between AIDS and the pathology linked to HTLV (Human T Cell Leukemia Lymphoma Virus), the only known human retro-virus at that time. Both situations affect CD4 T helper lymphocyte cells. HTLV induces the massive proliferation of one or several clones and their cancerization, whereas the other virus, the HIV virus tends to eradicate these cells without apparent discrimination.Un entretien avec le Docteur J. Leibowitch, Le Panorama du m√©decin n¬∞1507, 8 octobre 1982 Otherwise, these two pathological descriptions are present in both Africa and the Caribbean (see A Strange Virus of Unknown Origin Jacques Leibowitch, Ballantine Books, New York, 1985, translated from Un Virus Etrange Venu d‚ÄôAilleurs, Grasset Paris 1984). Indeed, in both Paris and Brussels, doctors had seen cases of patients having lived or spent time in Francophone Africa or in Haiti who suffered from a disease with an undeniable resemblance to that arising at the time in the United States in \\"immuno-deficient homosexuals\\". Leibowitch, informed by the Franco-American literary author Gilles Barbedette of the announcement by Robert Gallo in Medical World News (1 August 1982) that an HTLV type retro-virus could be the cause of AIDS, found in that most succinct brief the profile matching his CD4-tropic exotic viral suspect (in Grasset, Ballantine Books, works cited). The retro-viral inspiration was thus consolidated and opened between Bethesda (Gallo) and Paris (Leibowitch et al.) from August 1982 onwards.

It was then in November 1982 that Gallo informed him from Bethesda of his initial virology findings in keeping with the AIDS HTLV-type virus hypotheses. For his part, Willy Rozenbaum, warned in private by Leibowitch that an exotic HTLV-type retrovirus could well be the cause of AIDS, embarked upon a discreet collaboration with the Luc Montagnier team of the Pasteur Institute. Montagnier, along with his collaborator Jean-Claude Chermann, had just recently received news of the HTLV and AIDS hypotheses by Dr Paul Prunet, the then director of ¬´ Recherch√© & D√©veloppement ¬ª at Sanofi-Pasteur-Marnes La Coquette, where Leibowitch had given a speech at the end of November 1982.Paul Prunet,Comprendre la vie et ou comprendre les maladies. Avec petit retour sur l'histoire de la recherche sur le sida en France sur le site de Patrick Valas The Montagnier team subsequently detected in the cell culture of patient BRU the traces of the first non HTLV retrovirus in January 1983, a virus eventually recognized as the cause of AIDS thanks to the conclusive additions by Robert Gallo and his group (April 1984) Regarding Chronological Summary of Experiments Leading to the Isolation of HTLV-III from AIDS and ARC sur le site de la Jon Cohen AIDS Research Collection, 2 pages. Luc Montagnier and Fran√ßoise Barr√©-Sinoussi received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2008 for their work. In a letter to the prestigious magazine Nature Medicine in 2003, as well as in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 2008, Luc Montagnier recognized Jacques Leibowitch as being the initiator of the retro-virus hypothesis in FranceLuc Montagnier, 2003, Historical accuracy of HIV isolation, Nature Medicine 9.Luc Montagnier, Nobel lecture, 2008 However, the patented list of the discoverers of AIDS and HIV do not take Jacques Leibowitch into account for his contribution in the initial phases of the discovery. The scientific historian Mirko Grmek reflects back on the details of the stages that led to the discovery of the AIDS virus in his work ‚Äúthe History of AIDS‚Äù and the Jon Cohen AIDS Research Collection contains numerous archived documents on the subject. The book ‚ÄúSida.O‚Äù (AIDS.O) written by D. Lestrade and G.Pialoux contains also many details on the history of AIDS.Didier Lestrade et Gilles Pialoux, Sida 2.0, Regards crois√©s sur 30 ans d'une pand√©mie =Detection and elimination of HIV-positive contaminated blood at Garches and at Cochin= In 1984, whilst Luc Montagnier was working at the Institut Pasteur on an industrial test for HIV antibodies, Dominique Mathez and Jacques Leibowitch were working at Garches to elaborate a working test on tumour cells infected by the HTLV-III given to them by Pr Daniel Zagury at Paris University on behalf of Robert Gallo. Using this craftsman test, Mathez and Leibowitch discovered a disturbing frequency of individuals contaminated by the retro-virus amongst the polytransfusion recipients, and later, in collaboration with Dr Fran√ßois Pinon, head of transfusions at the Cochin hospital, go on to discover, the alarming proportion of HIV positive blood donors (1 in 200) in a pilot study carried out on donors in the Paris and Ile- de-France area. The health authorities were alerted on this issue together with their dramatic consequences for hemophiliacs (¬´ if the Cochin Hospital study is correct, then all anti-hemophiliac stocks are contaminated ‚Ä¶ ¬ª, Jean Baptiste Brunet at the French General Directory on Health, Mars 1985 13Retour sur l'affaire du sang contamin√© par Catherine Manuel et Pascal Auquier, 1/06/1996, site de La recherche ). It was thanks to this artisanal test that 50 HIV positive blood donations, established then to be 100% contaminating, were taken out of the transfusion process, and 150 potential receivers of this blood were protected from contamination.Le proc√®s du sang contamin√©. 5e jour par Eric Favereau et Armelle Thoraval, Lib√©ration le 17/02/1999 =Measure of viral levels in patients and evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment= At Garches, Dominique Mathez and Jacques Leibowitch developed a sophisticated and reliable biological test enabling them to quantify active HIV virus levels in patientsProductive human immunodeficiency virus infection levels correlate with AIDS-related manifestations in the patient, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. , 1990, Mathez et al. both before and during their antiviral treatment. Indeed, from 1987, patients in France most affected by the virus receive AZT treatment in the hope that this molecule might block the reproduction of the virus. It was with the aim of monitoring the progressive decline of virus levels in the treated patient that the team at Garches worked on their method. Leibowitch presented to world specialists assembled for the conference at Marnes la Coquette (Pasteur-les Cent Gardes symposium, November 1989) his results showing that the AZT monotherapy becomes quickly ineffective as demonstrated by returning viral levels in the treated patient, though in the first month such levels were significantly, yet only transiently, reduced. The measuring of HIV viral levels is later to become, in its commercial and industrial version, the universally used test to follow the development of the virus and the effectiveness of various treatments. Also, Jacques Leibowitch was the first in France to collect sequential cell specimens from individual patients at follow up, preserving living cell samples at extremely low temperatures since 1982. This live-frozen cell bank would later become precious for retrospective scientific investigations. =First tri-therapy trials based on viral end-point levels, ‚ÄúStalingrad trials, the besieged retrovirus‚Äù (Lib√©ration, August 2013)= Jacques Leibowitch is the father of the tri- therapy treatments in Europe.Essai \\"Stalingrad\\", le virus assi√©g√© par Eric Favereau, Lib√©ration du 3 et 4 ao√ªt 2013 Following the failure of AZT monotherapy to control HIV in the patient, the dual antiviral therapy (bi- therapy) soon revealed itself in Mathez and Leibowitch's pioneering test to be hardly more effective, thanks to the evidence revealed by the viral charge test at Garches. It is at this moment in 1994 that a new family of anti-HIV drugs emerges: the anti-proteases. Having observed in vitro the spectacular results of three combined anti-HIV nucleoside analogues (AZT +3TC +DDI) available for clinical use at the time (July 1994) and seen in patients the most effective antiviral impact of a first ever triple combination of nucleoside analogues (as shown by his home-made viral load quantitation system), Jacques Leibowitch went on to test the efficacy of the anti-proteases ... combined with pairs of nucleoside analogues to form a mixed-type triple combination therapy. On that basis, Leibowitch launched the Stalingrad Trial based on AZT+DDC+Ritonavir, a trial carried out in collaboration with Abbott, industrial producer of the anti-protease Ritonavir, under the protection of Health Minister Philippe Douste Blazy, outside the influence of the Agence Nationale de Recherches contre le SIDA (ANRS).Sida : la course aux mol√©cules. S√©bastien Dalgalarrondo,2004; Editions EHESS The results of the Stalingrad trial underlined the major importance measuring viral levels in real time in the patient in order to evaluate the impact of a given antiviral treatment. The success of this first tri-therapy treatment in the world was presented, together with that of another tri-therapy carried out by the group Merck, at the Washington Congress in February 1996. The findings were published in a scientific journal in 1997. The tri-therapy treatment has since been heralded a major turning point in the history of treatment of HIV infection. =Working towards an adjustment of maintenance treatments to adequate and sufficient dosages with the ICCARRE program= Since 2003, Jacques Leibowitch has been carrying out a pilot study aiming to diminish anti-HIV doses within weekly cycles. With ICCARREEn savoir plus sur le protocole ICCARRE sur le site d√©di√©(French abbreviation: Intermittent, in Short Cycles, the Anti Retrovirals may Retain Effectiveness), just under one hundred HIV positive patients at the Raymond Poincar√© hospital have undergone reduced treatment maintenance therapy reduced to 4, or 3, or 2, or even 1 day a week, instead of the currently universally obligatory dosages of 7 out of 7 days, without the virus reappearing. ICCARRE has yet to be validated by regulatory bodies as a recommended anti-HIV regime; were its dosages and recommendations to be confirmed in future prospective clinical trials, the ICCARRE study would open a new avenue in anti-HIV long-term therapy. According to the ICCARRE regime: following an early initial period in which control of retro-viral levels requires 7-day-a-week ‚Äúattack treatment‚Äù during one semester or more, weekly anti-viral dosages, necessary and sufficient to achieve effective long term control of the virus, may be administered in weekly reduced dosage; such a regime offers a number of advantages including : adhesion to the deontological principle of not exceeding required medicine dosages ; minimization of the toxic effects of these heavy chemical treatments over a long-term period ; improved willing patient acceptance of an effective treatment due to a physiologically and psychologically more acceptable programme ; reduction from between 40% and 80% of treatments that become exorbitantly costly over the long term. The first results of the ICCARRE study on 48 patients from Garches were published in 2010;Short cycles of antiretroviral drugs provide intermittent yet effective therapy: a pilot study in 48 patients with chronic HIV infection, FASEB J., 2010, Leibowitch et al. as were those of three other withdrawal trials of this kind with short cycles carried out successfully by Anthony Fauci et al.Short-cycle structured intermittent treatment of chronic HIV infection with highly active antiretroviral therapy:effects on virologic, immunologic, and toxicity parameters, PNAS, 2001, Dybul et al.A proof-of- concept study of short-cycle intermittent antiretroviral therapy with a once- daily regimen of didanosine, lamivudine, and efavirenz for the treatment of chronic HIV infection, JID, 2004, Dybul et al.,A randomized, controlled, trial of short cycle intermittent compared to continuous antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV infection in Uganda, Plos One, 2010, Reynolds et al. at NIH NIAID in the United States.

Life  Shearer‚Äôs early musical experiences were as a singer; the majority of his works are for the voice or voices, with a later emphasis on opera. With his first wife, pianist Barbara Shearer (1936‚Äì2005), Shearer's performances included art songs, some of which were his own. He studied at the University of California at Berkeley, where he earned a Ph.D. in 1972, and at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria where he received diplomas in concert singing and opera. He taught voice in Special Programs at the University of California at Berkeley. Among his composition teachers were Fred Lerdahl, Seymour Shifrin, Andrew Imbrie and Max Deutsch, with whom he studied in Paris. He has received many awards in music, including the Rome Prize Fellowship, the Aaron Copland Award, the Sylvia Goldstein Award, a Charles Ives Scholarship, residencies at the MacDowell Colony, and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts.  Musical style  When asked about his musical style in the discussion preceding the 2009 premiere of his opera The Dawn Makers, Shearer answered that it varies according to the demands of the medium. Critics also describe it variously. The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music observes that Shearer‚Äôs music, \\"though it recalls postwar serialism in its rhythms and textures, relies on traditional counterpoint and on tonal centers.\\" Its lyric quality is frequently cited: Jeff Rosenfeld, reviewing Shearer‚Äôs Outbound Passenger, found the music \\"tuneful and harmonious;\\" and of Shearer‚Äôs cantata King Midas, critic Robert Commanday wrote, ‚ÄòThe singing lines are fluid and supple, animated, alive; the harmony and scoring for a quintet of instruments and percussion battery (two players), rich but delicately so.\\" In the British periodical Opera, Allan Ulrich wrote that the score of Shearer‚Äôs chamber opera The Dawn Makers has \\"genuine personality. The hour-long opera abounds in extended ariosos and bravura outbursts and unfurls in a conservative idiom, spiced with dissonances which neatly evade the neo-Romantic pitfalls that prevail in American opera circles.\\" Of the same work, Thomas Busse wrote in San Francisco Classical Voice, \\"The music‚Äôs greatest strength was its singability, attributable to the composer‚Äôs being a vocalist himself. I would describe Shearer‚Äôs eclectic style as more declamatory than lyrical.\\" Of Shearer's opera Middlemarch in SpringKosman, Joshua, \\"Opera Review: 'Middlemarch in Spring' is a Sunny Romp,\\", San Francisco Chronicle, March 21, 2015 Janos Gereben wrote in the San Francisco Examiner, \\"Shearer's music is pleasantly dissonant, with a sound that sticks in the ears and memory.

In addition to being the first film about street racing youth, it is also notable for being one of the first films to feature actresses (Terry Moore and Noreen Nash) wearing bikini tops. A few scenes from one of the street races depicted were later reused in the opening of the 1950 film Hot Rod, also about street racing in Southern California. Synopsis The film is an early morality play on the dangers of speeding behind the wheel. Plot Michael \\"Micky\\" Clark (Hickman) turns his Ford roadster into a hot rod with his friend Todd (Robert Arthur), advised by Michael's older brother Jeff (James Cardwell), who learned about engines as a combat pilot. Todd (who has his own custom Ford hot rod) thinks Michael talks about his brother too much, but encourages him to soup up his car. Michael's and Jeff's father John is on his way home in a brand new convertible when he witnesses a fatal car accident, caused by reckless driving. Arriving home with the new car, Todd appreciates how the speedometer goes up to 120MPH, which causes John to give a lecture about the dangers of street racing. John has his own reckless driving habits (which he refuses to admit), on full display to the family when he gives them a ride in the new car. Michael's girlfriend Peggy (Sue England), his friend Todd and Todd's girlfriend Rusty (Terry Moore) all make fun of Michael for wanting to be cautious behind the wheel. Upset by this, Michael decides to participate with Todd in a street race. Despite the police intervening, Michael doesn't give up reckless driving, taking Todd for a ride in his father's new convertible, driving recklessly through the streets and evading the police. Despite close calls with police as well as the death of a fellow racer, they continue speeding, in part because of the encouragement from their girlfriends. Michael and Todd eventually push their luck to the point of fatal consequences. Michael's father John still possesses hotheaded driving habits, at least until he hears a police siren.

During this invasion the cities of Sandomierz, Krak√≥w, Lublin, Zawichost, and Bytom were sacked by Mongols for the second time.Stanis≈Çaw Krakowski, Polska w walce z najazdami tatarskimi w XIII wieku, MON, 1956, pp. 181-201 History The invasion began in late 1259, after a powerful Mongol army had been sent to the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia in order to punish King Daniel of Galicia for his independent actions. King Daniel had to comply to Mongol demands, and in 1258, his forces joined the Mongols in the raid on the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. To weaken Daniel's position, the Golden Horde decided to attack his allies, Hungarian King B√©la IV, and Duke of Krak√≥w, Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste. The purpose of the invasion was to loot the divided Kingdom of Poland (see Testament of Boles≈Çaw III Krzywousty), and to weaken Duke of Krak√≥w Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste, whose province, Lesser Poland, began a process of fast development. According to the Mongol plan, the invaders were to enter Lesser Poland east of Lublin, and head towards Zawichost. After crossing the Vistula, the Mongol army was to break into two columns, operating north and south of the Holy Cross Mountains. The columns were to unite near Chƒôciny, and then head southwards, to Krak√≥w. Altogether, Mongol forces under Boroldai were 30,000 strong, with Ruthenian units of King Daniel of Galicia, his brother Vasilko Romanovich, Kipchaks and probably Lithuanians or Yotvingians. The events that took place in the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia echoed in Lesser Poland, and in late 1258, preparations for the defence of Krak√≥w began. The work was quickly abandoned, and Piast dynasty dukes returned to their internal quarrels. In October 1259, right before the invasion, Duke of Greater Poland Boles≈Çaw the Pious allied himself with Duke Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste and Duke of Mazovia Siemowit I, in order to attack Duke of Kujawy, Casimir I of Kuyavia. A few weeks later, Lesser Poland was invaded by the Mongol hordes. The Mongolian army concentrated near Che≈Çm, and after capturing Polish towns east of the Vistula, the invaders appeared at Sandomierz (early December 1259). Boroldai ordered Ruthenian auxiliary units to besiege and capture the city, while main Mongol forces marched westwards toward the Holy Cross Mountains. Their march was marked by an orgy of destruction; among others, ancient abbeys of Koprzywnica and WƒÖchock were looted (most probably, they failed to capture the ≈Åysa G√≥ra Benedictine Abbey). The Mongols limited their advance to Radom in the north and Sulej√≥w in the west, and did not enter other Polish provinces. The two columns of the invading army joined forces near Kielce and Chƒôciny, in mid-January 1260. At the same time, the siege of Sandomierz continued. Defenders of the city fiercely resisted all attacks of the Mongol and Ruthenian forces. After several weeks, Mongol leaders began negotiations with the Poles, who were commanded by a man named Piotr of Krepa. Ruthenian princes, which took part in the siege, advised Piotr of Krepa to accept Mongol offers, and abandon Sandomierz, in exchange of safe passage for all residents of the city. Finally, facing hunger and epidemics, the Poles left Sandomierz on February 2, 1260; the Mongols broke their promise and massacred the civilians and the defenders. The city itself was looted and burned to the ground. On February 5, main Mongol forces abandoned Sandomierz. All units joined forces on February 10‚Äì12, and entered densely populated southern Lesser Poland. After looting the abbeys at Jƒôdrzej√≥w, Mogila, Szczyrzyc and Miech√≥w, the invaders flooded the region in an orgy of murder and destruction. In the second half of February, the Mongols reached Krak√≥w, quickly capturing the city, but without the Wawel Hill, which was fortified and defended. To prevent Silesian Piast dukes from sending their support to Lesser Poland, Boroldai sent some units to the area of Bytom. Duke Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste himself fled to Sieradz, with his wife Kinga of Poland. In late March 1260, the Mongols left Lesser Poland eastward along the Carpathian foothills.  Aftermath  The province that they had invaded was completely destroyed with rich loot taken. Some 10,000 Poles were taken with the invaders as slaves. The success of the Golden Horde was complete, as they managed to destroy an anti-Mongol alliance, and completely subjugate the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia.

The Mongol and Ruthenian armies completely destroyed the city, murdering almost all residents, including 49 Dominican friars with their abbot Sadok, who hid in the St. Jacob church (see Sadok and 48 Dominican martyrs from Sandomierz). As a result, old Sandomierz, located on the Staromiejskie Hill, ceased to exist. According to a legend, before the sack the Mongols sent a Ruthenian envoy to Sandomierz, promising Castellan Piotr Krepa that the city would be spared if its residents gave away their valuables. Krepa decided to negotiate with the invaders, and entered the Mongol camp, where he was murdered. The sack itself was described in the Galician‚ÄìVolhynian Chronicle.  Aftermath  In 1286, High Duke of Poland Leszek II the Black decided to rebuild Sandomierz in a new location, more convenient for defence. The city once again received its Magdeburg rights (the original document still exists), and its first wojt was a nobleman named Witkon. Duke Leszek also invited Dominican friars from other locations, giving them a plot of land within city limits. Martyrdom of Sadok and 48 Dominican martyrs of Sandomierz In the 1950s and 1960s, Polish archaeologists found mass graves with human bones, located near the St. Jacob church. After extensive research, it was concluded that they were victims of the 1260 invasion. The bones are now kept in the cellar of the church.

The invasion was also part of the hostilities between Poland and Ruthenia; in 1281, the Poles had defeated a Mongol force near Goslicz which had entered Duke Leszek's territory in support of Lev I.Jackson, p. 202 Planning In November 1287, Nogai Khan demanded that the princes of Ruthenia show up personally leading their armies to join him on an expedition to Poland, while he and Talabuga gathered their own cavalry. He assembled what the Galician-Volhynian Chronicle referred to as \\"a great host\\" alongside his vassals on the Polish-Galician border. After leaving some men behind in Ruthenia to defend his rear, he went about planning the invasion.Krakowski, p. 226 The expedition was undertaken by a force of 30,000 men, a mix of Mongol/Turkic troops and Ruthenian vassal troops. The plan, devised by Nogai Khan, was similar to the one from 1259. The Mongol army was divided into two columns. 20,000 cavalry (including Ruthenians) under Talabuga attacked towards Sandomierz and northern Lesser Poland, while another 10,000 cavalry (all Mongol/Turkic; no sources reference Ruthenians)Krawkoski, p. 212: \\"W armii Nogaja nie by≈Ço kontyngent√≥w ruskich, przynajmniej brak co do tego wzmianek ≈∫r√≥d≈Çowych.\\" under Nogai headed towards the area of Krak√≥w - Sacz. Like earlier invasions, the campaign was to be conducted with great speed and surprise to prevent the enemy from properly marshaling their forces. After looting their respective provinces and capturing Sandomierz, they were to unite north of Krak√≥w.Krakowski, p. 227: \\"Zamiar strategiczny polega≈Ç na koncentrycznym\\" uderzeniu dwu grup: 1) pod wodzƒÖ Telebogi od strony wlodzmierza wolynskiego przez sandomierz w kierunku ku zachodowi (zlupienie rejonu sandomierskiego), 2) pod wodza Nogaja cd strony przemysla wzdluz karpat na krakow (zlupienie rejonu Krak√≥w ‚Äî SƒÖcz).\\" After joining the two groups, the combined host was planned to march through Kielce, Chƒôciny, Jƒôdrzej√≥w, and Miech√≥w, before sacking Krak√≥w. After Poland was razed, the Mongol troops were to return to Rus. The Polish defenders did not have any elaborate plan, as the raid was clearly a surprise. An ad hoc strategy was devised whereby most forces concentrated on castles and fortified cities rather than riding out to meet the Mongols in field battles. Duke Leszek, with his main force, stood in the path of the first column.Krakowski, p. 227. Invasion =Northern column= The northern column of the Mongol forces was supported by a large contingent of the Mongol vassals, Ruthenians, under Duke Mstislav of Lutsk, Duke Volodymir of Volhynia, and Duke Lev of Halicz. Leszek II the Black stood opposed to the Mongols with probably 15,000 strong. Furthermore, in comparison to the second invasion, several towns and cities had been fortified. Krak√≥w in particular was described as having a castle made entirely out of stone, and was \\"protected by catapults and large and small crossbows.‚ÄùWilliam of Rubruck. The Journey of William of Rubruck. In The Mission to Asia, ed. Christopher Dawson. London: Sheed and Ward, 1955. Page 131. This was in sharp contrast to the first two invasions, when Krak√≥w's citadel was made of wood.Pow, p. 70 On December 7, 1287, the northern group of Mongol forces under Talabuga left a camp near Wlodzimierz Wolynski, and, after by-passing Lublin, the army tried to cross the Vistula near Zawichost. Since the river was not frozen, they had to find a ford, heading southwards. The invaders besieged and assaulted Sandomierz, but abandoned their siege after their storming attempt was beaten back.Pow, p. 77: \\"The Mongols were able to destroy some fortresses and towns, but their siege of Sandomir failed.\\"Jackson, p. 205: \\"Tole Buqa failed to take Sandomir, while Nogai headed a similarly unsuccessful attack upon Cracow, which the Polish annals place around Christmas\\". They left Ruthenian units in the area of the city and changed their course. Mongol and Ruthenian forces failed to capture many fortified locations after the column dispersed into multiple detachments and raiding parties. Most likely, a major detachment attempted to approach the ≈Åysa G√≥ra Abbey with another approaching the town of Tursko, while skirmishing with local Polish forces. A few days after the unsuccessful siege of Sandomierz, forces of Talabuga's main column were attacked by a Polish force of unknown but significant size under Duke Leszek near the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains, and were defeated in the Battle of ≈Åag√≥w, which Polish annals place on December 20.Krakowski, p. 209-210 The defeat was quite severe, and after reaching the area of Kielce, the Mongol forces began a retreat, taking what loot they had already gathered with them. In January 1288, they reached their winter camp in Lwow. Leszek and his army meanwhile headed towards Krak√≥w, to prepare the defense of the Polish capital. =Southern column= The southern group of Mongol forces under Nogai Khan (divided into at least three detachments) crossed into Poland on December 24, 1287 and besieged Krak√≥w. The Mongols launched an unsuccessful assault on the fortified city, suffering heavy casualties and losing several of their leaders in the process.Chambers, p.165: \\"Nogai advanced against Cracow and Tole-Buka attacked Sandomir, but the Poles had learned by past experience. The garrisons were not tempted to engage the enemy in the field. They remained on the walls and both [Cracow and Sandomir] held out against the Mongol assaults\\".Pow, p.77: \\"Their attack on Krakow was also repelled with the loss of many of their leaders, and for their resistance, the citizens of Krakow received tax exemption\\". Nogai Khan decided to change plans, divide his detachment into smaller units, and plunder the areas both north and south of Krak√≥w; his units plundered the villages around Krak√≥w and the Duchy of Sieradz while engaging in small battles with local Polish forces sallying from towns and castles. Parallel to this, two other columns of his army besieged the towns of Podol√≠nec and Stary SƒÖcz.Krakowski, p. 209 Soon after the battle of Krak√≥w, Leszek, his wife, and a small group of retainers slipped into the Kingdom of Hungary and requested aid from King Ladislaus IV, who had defeated another Mongol invasion less than two years earlier. At Podol√≠nec, the Mongols devastated the settlement and the area around it after some skirmishes with the local militia. At Stary SƒÖcz, the siege lasted roughly a month without bringing any tangible results. The town was well stocked, with strong walls and a good garrison. Meanwhile, the Hungarian king had approved action against the Mongols, and tasked the noble George of S√≥v√°r with leading the Hungarian expedition. His expeditionary force came up from Podol√≠nec and Ke≈æmarok, adding local Polish troops to their number on the way.Krakow, p.217 The Hungarian-Polish force completely surprised a small Mongol army of 1,000Jackson, p. 205: \\"The king had dispatched a corps of Hungarian troops under Gy√∂rgy to aid the Poles. Gy√∂rgy engaged a force of about 1,000 Mongols near Sandecz (now Stary SƒÖcz), and killed their commander\\" men and annihilated it at the Battle of Stary SƒÖcz, killing the army's commander. This was the last major engagement of the invasion. Leszek mobilized the main Polish army in the meantime and sought to join it with George's Hungarians; recognizing that his remaining forces would be dispersed and outnumbered if they remained, Nogai regrouped his men and retreated from Poland with most of his army intact. He arrived back in Ruthenia in late January, 1288, where his soldiers plundered the villages of his vassals in Galicia.Krakwoski, p. 218 Aftermath Compared to the first two invasions, the raid of 1287‚Äì88 was short and much less devastating. The Mongols did not capture any significant cities or castles and lost a significant number of men. They also took fewer prisoners and loot than in the previous invasions. Polish historian Stefan Krakowski credits the relative failure of the Mongol invasion to two main causes. First, while 30,000 men was larger than the previous incursions into Poland, the rivalry between Talabuga and Nogai meant that the two columns didn't cooperate well, with the former withdrawing by the time the latter entered Poland. Second, the Poles' upgraded fortifications made their settlements much harder to take, which enabled Leszek and his nobles to put into action a simple three-stage defensive plan. The first stage was passive defense by garrisons (e.g. Sandomierz, ≈Åysa G√≥ra, Krak√≥w, Tursko), the second was the fight against small Mongol detachments by local sallying forces, and the third stage was a counterblow of a large Hungarian-Polish army against the dispersed and reduced Mongols.Krakowski p. 223 This contrasted quite sharply with the first invasion. There the Mongols also dispersed their army into smaller units, but were able to easily take the poorly fortified settlements they attacked and smash the Polish forces sent to meet them in open field pitched battles, destroying Polish forces near-simultaneously at Sandomierz, Tursko, and Tarczek, in mid February and at Chmielnik, Krak√≥w, and Raciborz in late March, without much skirmishing or any protracted sieges. Legacy The 1287‚Äì1288 campaign is commonly held to be the origin of Lajkonik, a folk figure and unofficial symbol of the city of Krak√≥w. The (possibly apocryphal) story goes that a group of Poles discovered a Mongol camp outside the city walls of Krak√≥w in December 1287 while the Mongols were besieging it, and launched a surprise raid in which several Mongol generals were killed, including the commander of the siege. The leader of the raid then wore the Mongol commander's richly decorated outfit back into the city.Abulafia, David (1999). The New Cambridge Medieval History. Volume 5.

The Group was founded in 1971 and has been involved in the creation of hundreds of artworks in and around the city. CPAG supports the production of public murals, mosaics, sculptures and space designs in collaboration with community participants. CPAG also educates artists and the public about the history and possibilities of collaborative public art. Several of its recent works have been large bricolage mosaics in city underpasses. History Founded in 1971, the Chicago Public Art Group began as a cooperative of artists to enhance Chicago communities through the creation of public murals. Concerned with societal relationships to art, the group wanted to establish communication and working creative partnerships between artists and city residents. Muralists William Walker and John Pitman Weber were among the co-founders of what was then called the Chicago Muralists Group. From the beginning, a focus of the cooperative was turning some of the most neglected of urban spaces into artistic canvasses. It was influenced by the past work of individual artists working in the city. The group-created Fabric of our Lives, by Miriam Socoloff and Cynthia Weiss in 1980, lays claim to being the first community-based mosaic in the United States, according to executive director emeritus Jon Pounds. Artwork There are hundreds of significant artworks associated with the Group in various public places, mostly within the City of Chicago. These include murals, mosaics, sculptures, and space or landscape designs. Most projects have included community organizations, residents, or schools in the creation of these art pieces. Some public artworks may cost as much as $100,000 and more to create. These include large mosaics placed on the walls of highway underpasses, or murals on buildings or train viaducts. The artworks are often community, local history, or environment themed. The large glass mosaic \\"Aqua Interlude & Reflection\\" (2011), in a pedestrian underpass, was created with the help of a youth project and explores light and water. The large tile and glass mosaic \\"Indian Land Dancing\\" (2009) in a highway underpass, was created with the help of the American Indian Center and illustrates local Native American history and modern experience. Another large underpass mural and mosaic, \\"Growing\\" (2008) is based around the theme of local community and growth. Several of these recent artworks, which may be 10 to 12 feet high, and 120 to 160 feet long, have employed a type of bricolage technique. Reporter Geoffery Bear described this as the \\"technique of taking broken pieces of ceramic tile, and other three dimensional objects, pieces of mirror, actual photographs, and putting it all together.\\" According to Sue-Lyn Erbeck and Marty Bach, this technique can be \\"loose and improvisational\\" and describe a representative process involving: \\"1. Photos ... transferred to acetate, projected onto the wall and traced with acrylic paint. 2. Broken pieces of mirror applied to the outline. 3. Loose elements, such as the clouds and words, attached. 4. Buckets of various broken elements such as ceramic tiles, china and porcelain, filled in around outlines. 5. Spaces between the tiles grouted and painted. 6. Paintings . . . attached to the wall.\\" Organization Chicago Public Art Group's mission includes designing public art, enhancing individual artistic skills and expression, educating professional artists concerning issues of public art, and building community appreciation with respect to the benefits of public art creation. The Group's board of directors includes artists and community leaders. It provides artistic leadership and professional management to public and private organizations in the creation of art. The organization is centered on an elected group of \\"Core Artists,\\" who have previously worked on or led its projects. Its \\"Senior Artists Circle\\" is an invitation only group that recognizes prominent public artists. The Group also promotes the restoration of artwork.

Davies retired from IFAW in 2003 but remains active in animal welfare through two organisations he founded, Network for Animals and the Political Animal Lobby.  Early life  Davies was born in 1935 in the Welsh mining village of Tonyrefail.Barry, D. (2005) Icy Battleground: Canada, the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Seal Hunt, pp.5-10. Breakwater Books, Canada, Much of his early childhood was spent with his grandparents while his parents served in the war effort. His father was a rear gunner in the Royal Air Force (RAF), posted to India, and his mother worked in a munitions factory, returning home only on weekends.Davies, B. (1989). Red Ice: My Fight to Save the Seals, p.39, Methuen London Ltd, London At the end of the war, when Davies was 11, the family moved to England. He left school at 14, because of ill health, and worked at various manual jobs throughout his youth.,Clarke, C. ‚ÄúIFAW Begins: Brian Davies, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, and the New Brunswick Humane Movement in the 1960s.‚Äù University of New Brunswick, Canada, 2009. Retrieved 24 April 2013. Davies met his first wife, Joan, in 1955. The couple emigrated to Canada where they had two children, Nicholas and Toni. When Davies joined the Canadian army in the following year, the family relocated to the town of Oromocto in the province of New Brunswick.  Beginnings of a career in animal welfare  Davies‚Äô interest in animal welfare began in 1958, when a car struck a dog outside the family's home. Because there was no local vet, Davies contacted the Fredericton SPCA and took the dog to the Fredericton Animal Hospital. This incident resulted in Davies becoming the Oromocto representative for the SPCA on an unofficial and unpaid basis.Davies, B. Red Ice: My Fight to Save the Seals. Methuen London Ltd., 1989, p.31Kalland, Arne (2011). Unveiling the Whale: Discourses on Whales and Whaling, p. 52. Berghahn Books, Oxford. . Upon being offered the job of field secretary for the New Brunswick PCA (NB SPCA) in 1961, Davies resigned from the military. From 1964-1969, Davies served as executive secretary for the NB SPCA, which was considered by some of its prominent members to be lacking in influence and drive, according to the society's minutes. Over the period of Davies‚Äô tenure, he oversaw the group's transformation from one focused primarily on humane education for school children and the inspection of cases of animal cruelty, to an organisation that sought to address animal welfare issues at multiple societal levels. It was through his involvement with the NB SPCA that Davies learned of the commercial seal hunting industry in North East Canada.  Opposition to Canadian seal hunt  Davies‚Äô first visit to the Canadian harp seal hunt, accompanied by Jacques Vall√©e, the general manager of the Canadian SPCA, was on 12 March 1965 ‚Äì a year which saw a total of 182,758 seals killed for their pelts and fatDavies, B. (1989). Red Ice: My Fight to Save the Seals, p.5, Methuen London Ltd, London On returning to his base in Prince Edward Island, Davies found two live seal pups on the shoreline that had been taken there by sealers. He took them to his home in Oromocto where they were raised by the Davies family. A local paper ran a story on their efforts to save the seals, resulting in national media attention and an influx of funding with which the Davies would run the ‚ÄúSave the Seals‚Äù campaign.Davies, B. (1989). Red Ice: My Fight to Save the Seals, pp.14-16, Methuen London Ltd, London  International Fund for Animal Welfare  In 1969 the NB SPCA withdrew from the seal campaign, having concluded that it was conducted humanely and arguing that it was ‚Äúdraining too much attention and effort away from other matters the society took responsibility for‚Äù. Despite the split with the SPCA, Davies sought to further develop the seal campaign and used the ‚ÄúSave the Seals‚Äù fund to found the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). Davies promoted opposition to the seal hunt by enlisting the support of prominent celebrities, such as French actress Brigitte Bardot, to appear before cameras at the site of the hunt and to emphasise the cruelty taking place.Nadeau, C. (2001) \\"Fur Nation: From the Beaver to Brigitte Bardot\\" The stance Davies took against the seal hunt resulted in antagonism from the Canadian government, which sought to distance itself from the increasingly negative image of the hunt.Barry, D. (2005) Icy Battleground: Canada, the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Seal Hunt, p. 42. Breakwater Books, Canada, . The tension peaked in 1977, when Davies was charged with violating the Seal Protection Regulations by operating a helicopter in a prohibited area. He was sentenced to a jail term of twenty-one days, a $1,000 fine or six months additional jail time, and probation conditions which forbade him to fly any craft over the Gulf or Front for three years. Moreover, the Canadian government warned IFAW that continued campaigning would result in the termination of IFAW's tax-exempt charitable status. The pressure drove IFAW to voluntarily relinquish its charitable status and move its headquarters to the United States.Barry, D. (2005) Icy Battleground: Canada, the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Seal Hunt, p. 44. Breakwater Books, Canada, . In light of the increasing difficulty of campaigning in Canada, Davies began lobbying in Europe for the closure of international markets for the products of the hunt. In 1983, 18 years after the start of the seal campaign, the European Union General Court placed a ban on the importation of newborn harp seals (whitecoats) and hooded seal pups (bluebacks) throughout Europe, resulting in a huge reduction in seals killed in Canada's commercial seal hunt. In 1984, Davies established the IFAW Charitable Trust (IFAW CT) and the Political Animal Lobby (PAL), which enabled the development of relationships with political figures. In order to increase fundraising Davies developed a system of direct mail fundraising in which computer software filtered members according to geographic location, interests and the amount and date of their last contribution. These methods helped spur the organization's rapid growth. Barry, D. (2005) Icy Battleground: Canada, the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Seal Hunt, pp.7. Breakwater Books, Canada, .  Political Animal Lobby  Davies retired from IFAW to continue working with the Political Animal Lobby (PAL). PAL directed lobbying efforts at government ministers and other political decision-makers. Instead of demanding new legislation, PAL provided technical advice in an attempt to build working relationships with sympathetic politicians, and began making strategic donations to political parties. By 1996, PAL had made donations to a number of British political parties, most notably a ¬£1-million donation to the Labour Party. PAL continues to be active in its lobbying of British parliament and continues to donate funds to this work.Ryder, Richard D. (2000). Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism‚Äù, pp. 201-205. Berg, Oxford. . In recent years, PAL has expanded its activities internationally and is now active in European, Arab, Asian and African countries.  Network For Animals  Davies founded Network for Animals (NFA) in 1996. NFA is a campaign- directed animal welfare organisation, which initially focused on the dog-meat trade in the Philippines. The NFA has subsequently increased its scope to include a wide range of animal welfare issues in its campaigns. In the UK, it campaigns against badger culling and hunting with hounds. In South Africa, it campaigns against rhinoceros poaching and elephant culling. In Canada, NFA continues to try to end the seal hunt. Caring for street dogs is a major focus for NFA. It provides food and veterinary care for street dogs in Croatia, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Montenegro, the Philippines, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Uruguay.

It was formerly a borough, also called Newcourt or St Canice's, separated by the River Breagagh from the walled town of Kilkenny to the south. History The site of Irishtown was the capital of the Mac Giolla Ph√°draig dynasty of the medieval Kingdom of Ossory, and a daughter house of Aghaboe Abbey was built there. In 1111 the Synod of R√°th Breasail divided Ireland into dioceses, with the Diocese of Ossory based on the Gaelic kingdom and the abbey church became St Canice's Cathedral. The name Kilkenny is from the Irish \\"church of St. Canice\\". The status of episcopal seat spurred the growth of the existing settlement. After the Norman invasion of Ireland, the Anglo-Normans built Kilkenny Castle near by as the seat of the new County of Kilkenny, which had largely the same extent as the Kingdom of Ossory. Two separate boroughs were recognised: the \\"English Town\\" or \\"High Town\\" of the colonists around the Castle, and the Gaelic \\"Irish Town\\" around the Cathedral. When County Kilkenny was a liberty with a seneschal, the English borough of Kilkenny was within it, but the precincts of the cathedral were excluded from the liberty, in the \\"crosslands\\" (church ground) subject to the sheriff of County Dublin. Kilkenny and Irishtown were both walled towns with separate walls, and connected by Watergate Bridge over the Breagagh. Irishtown was poorer than Kilkenny. The corporation's seal, whose Latin inscription read \\"the common seal of the Kilkenny citizens of the see of Ossory\\", was of inferior metal to that of the Kilkenny corporation. The members of the corporation were clergy in the diocese. In 1609, Kilkenny borough was made a city, and a County of the City was created, separate from County Kilkenny, with its own sheriff and grand jury. The city comprised parts of four parishes, and the new county covered the whole of each, with the area outside the borough forming the \\"liberties\\" of the city.Parliamentary Gazetteer (1846) \\"Kilkenny [county of the city]\\" pp.429‚Äì431 The borough of Irishtown in the parish of St Canice was thenceforth in the liberties of the County of the City of Kilkenny. It was through Dean's Gate in 1650 that Cromwell's army entered Irishtown and from there captured Kilkenny, capital of Confederate Ireland. St Canice Borough was a borough constituency in the House of Commons of Ireland, separate from Kilkenny City constituency. The latter was in the direct control of the Earl of Ormond, whereas the patron of St Canice was the Bishop of Ossory in the established Church of Ireland. Since the power of appointing the bishop was in the gift of the Earl of Ormond, the practical difference was slight. Although St Canice Borough was disfranchised at the Acts of Union 1800, the borough corporation remained separate from that of Kilkenny until the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. That Act abolished both corporations, and appointed the town commissioners of Kilkenny borough as successors to both, and defined new limits of the borough of Kilkenny, which included all the land of both predecessor boroughs. The Irishtown corporation records were transferred to the Kilkenny Tholsel. In 1846, the Parliamentary Gazetteer wrote: Geography The historic neighbourhood retains a distinctive local character within the modern city of Kilkenny. The street leading south from the Cathedral to the Breagagh is called Irishtown.

Due to the postcards he mailed to the police and media, he was dubbed The Postcard Killer.The Postcard Killers p. 98 Early life John Frank Hickey was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, to Irish immigrants Michael J. Hickey and Mary Ann Magrath.McLaughlin, Vance. The Postcard Killer: The True Story of America's First Profiled Serial Killer and How the Police Brought Him Down, Thunder's Mouth Press, New York, 2006. He was baptized Roman Catholic at St. Patrick's Church, which was only two blocks from his parents' lodgings. After his arrest for murder in 1912, Hickey claimed to have been physically abused by his father. In his early teens, Hickey joined Lowell's First Congregational Church on Kirk Street. He also became an official of the Lowell YMCA and the Christian Endeavor. First murder On September 1, 1883, 18-year-old Hickey contacted police and said that he had found 34-year-old pharmacist Edwin W. Morey dead on the floor of the McGibbon's Drugstore, where both had worked. Hickey claimed that Morey had been despondent for some time due to alcoholism and that he had been trying to help his co-worker regain sobriety. As the doctor believed that Morey had taken poison, a stomach pump was brought. At midnight, Morey showed some signs of life, but died shortly after three o'clock in the morning. Years later, Hickey admitted to having murdered Morey with laudanum. He had been afraid that if their employer had found Morey intoxicated, he might fire them both. Freemasonry Listing his occupation as \\"Secretary of the YMCA\\", Hickey applied for and received membership in Lowell's William North Masonic Lodge in 1887. In 1889, he became a Master Mason. Despite his later claims, Hickey never attained the rank of 32nd degree Freemason. Although his biographer Vance McLaughlin describes Hickey as having \\"quit the Masons in June 1895\\", Masonic records tell a different story. In March 1895, Hickey was arrested in Lowell for stealing 20 gallons of alcohol from his employer. In response, the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts ruled Hickey \\"a liar and profane\\" and expelled him \\"from all the rights and privileges of Freemasonry\\" on June 12, 1895.\\"Proceedings of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Ancient Free And Accepted Masons in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\\" 1895, pp.121-22. Second murder In 1896 Hickey left Lowell and would never live there again. Between then and 1902, he drifted around Canada and the Northeastern United States, working various industrial jobs. On December 10, 1902, Hickey encountered Michael R. Kruck, an eleven-year-old newspaper vendor. When Kruck offered to sell him a newspaper, Hickey responded that he would purchase all of them if the boy would follow him into Central Park. When Kruck did so, Hickey strangled him and left his body with the newspaper bundle under his head. The coroner later examined the body and found no evidence of sexual assault. The coroner's inquest ruled that Michael R. Kruck met his death by being strangled \\"by some person or persons unknown to this jury.\\"\\"Newsboy Murdered in Central Park; Little Fellow was Strangled, Presumably with Knotted Cord. Queer Wound on Cheek Puzzles Coroner's Physician- No Clue to Perpetrator of Crime\\", New York Times, December 12, 1902. Pagw 16. On December 12, 1902, Michael Kruck's body was released from the morgue and buried at Brooklyn's Washington Jewish Cemetery. Third murder On October 12, 1911, Hickey, then employed as a steel plant supervisor in Lackawanna, New York, noticed seven- year-old Joey Joseph playing at his father's men's furnishing store. Later, when Joey was making mud puddles with a friend in the street near his house, Hickey motioned to them to join him. He gave Joey a few pennies to buy candy for himself and his friend. Upon Joey's return, Hickey abruptly told his friend that it was time for him to go home. Hickey then took Joey by the hand and led him to an outhouse behind a saloon on Ridge Road. There Hickey strangled Joey into unconsciousness, sexually molested him, and then strangled him to death. Hickey then dumped the boy's body into the outhouse pit. Postcards Despite the assistance of the Buffalo Police Department, the investigation into Joey Joseph's disappearance had almost no leads. Then, on October 30, 1911, a postcard was delivered to Lackawanna police chief Gilson. It read, \\"Joseph Joseph will be found in the bottom of a water closet with three seats, back of the saloon near Doyles, on Ridge Road. A drunk crazed brain done the deed, and remorse and sorrow for the parents is bringing results that will soon come to an end. The demon whisky will then have one more victim, making four in all.

Arthur later in life). In 1842 he emigrated to the United States with his uncle, at first helping on a farm in New York State. He learned the blacksmith and machinist trades. In 1849 he became a railroad worker, and was later promoted to engineer on the New York Central Railroad. He was one of the early members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, which was founded in May 1863, and he quickly rose through the ranks. In 1863 the Pennsylvania Railroad ordered a reduction of pay, and the engineers walked off the job. The BLE leader Charles Wilson publicly criticized the strike action. The Brotherhood called a special meeting in Cleveland on 25 February 1874. The founder of the BLE, William D. Robinson, made a spirited speech vindicating the strikers. Charles Wilson was forced to resign and Arthur was elected Grand Chief Engineer. Union leader In 1875 Arthur negotiated the first contract between a union and a railroad with the New York Central Railroad of William Henry Vanderbilt. The contract included a guaranteed daily wage. In 1876 the BLE was involved in an unsuccessful strike against the Boston and Maine Railroad. The next year Arthur and the BLE had to deal with the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, in which the BLE allied itself with the Workingmen's Party of the United States. After the collapse of that effort, the BLE became a more restricted organization. Members had to be white, literate, 21 or older and experienced engineers, and from 1885 could not belong to other labor organizations. By 1887 the BLE had over 25,000 members, and in the 1880s negotiated contracts with more than 100 railroads. The BLE set up exemplary employee benefit and insurance plans. Arthur worked to establish good relations with railroad managers, preferring to negotiate rather than call a strike. It was said of Arthur that he \\"had rare skill in formulating reasonable demands, and by consistently putting moderate demands strongly instead of immoderate demands weakly he kept the good will of railroad managers, while steadily obtaining better terms for his men.\\" However, in the mid-1880s labor unrest grew. The BLE was successful in several strikes against granger roads, but the Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888 did not succeed. The rival Knights of Labor undercut the BLE, replacing the striking engineers with their own members. Arthur withdrew from the strike and returned to a policy of cooperating with the railroad management. Arthur would not support the Knights of Labor in their strike against New York Central Railroad in 1890. Arthur also undermined the efforts of Eugene V. Debs in 1893-1894 to make gains for the members of the American Railway Union. In his later life, while still heading the BLE, Arthur became a wealthy man. He made wise real estate investments and acquired a sizable fortune. He bought an imposing stone mansion in Cleveland, became a bank director and was a leading citizen of Cleveland. Arthur died unexpectedly on 17 July 1903, and the Grand Assistant Chief A.B. Youngson became head of the union. However, Youngson was himself on his deathbed, and died on 31 July 1903. Warren Stanford Stone became his successor. References =Citations= =Sources=  McMurry, Donald L.

Biography Born as Albion Fox in 1861 on a farm near Winslow, Illinois, Albion was a son of Seventh-day Adventist Church John Fox Ballenger. In the 1880s he was a religious liberty advocate and five years later got a license from the Seventh-day Adventist church. In 1890 Ballenger was elected as secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association and by 1893 served as assistant editor of the American Sentinel magazine. In 1897 he began a movement called Receive Ye the Holy Ghost, which also became his most popular sermon. The same year he wrote a book called Power for Witnessing which is still available as a reprint. In the early 20th century he was invited to Great Britain as an evangelist. During this time, he began to re-examine the Seventh-day Adventist denomination's doctrine of the \\"sanctuary.\\" He came to the conclusion that the Adventist doctrine of the sanctuary needed to be revised to conform to the biblical types and the teaching of the Book of Hebrews. He rewrote Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of the sanctuary typology by adding the interpretation explicated in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Controversy and punishment His position was that Christ entered the Holy of Holies, which was part of the Tabernacle, immediately after the resurrection, and did not wait until 1844. On May 20, 1905 the General Conference Session examined his views and warned him not to publish them. The same day, a Seventh-day Adventist prophet named Ellen White decided to join in the opposition against his views by issuing a letter in which she accused him of being part of a satanic agency. On May 24, 1905, she published another letter of accusation in which she stated that he had made a specious error and demanded he accept the church's position. He refused to do this and was fired. Over the next couple of years White issued seven more letters of accusation which were published on January 30, 1906, June 29 of the same year and on July 4, 1907, respectively. In 1909 Ballenger wrote a book called Cast Out for the Cross of Christ in which he expressed his views and in 1914 founded a magazine called The Gathering Call. His views were never accepted by the church. He died in 1921.

He studies how digital technologies are changing the world.  Life and work  McAfee received his BS in mechanical engineering in 1988, his MS in management in 1990, and in 1999 he obtained his Doctorate from Harvard Business School, with a thesis titled The impact of enterprise information systems on operational effectiveness: An empirical investigation. He completed two Master of Science and two Bachelor of Science degrees at MIT. His research investigates how IT changes the way companies perform, organize themselves, and compete, and at a higher level, how computerization affects competition, society, the economy, and the workforce. He was previously a professor at Harvard Business School and a fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. McAfee is the author of Enterprise 2.0, published in November 2009 by Harvard Business School Press, and co-author of Race Against the Machine with Erik Brynjolfsson. In 2014, this work was expanded into the book The Second Machine Age. He writes for publications including Harvard Business Review, The Economist, Forbes, The Wall St. Journal, and The New York Times. He speaks frequently to both academic and industry audiences, most notably at TED 2013 and on The Charlie Rose Show.  Work  =Research= McAfee coined the phrase ‚ÄúEnterprise 2.0‚Äù in a spring 2006 Sloan Management Review article to describe the use of Web 2.0 tools and approaches by businesses. He also began blogging at that time, both about Enterprise 2.0 and about his other research. In the July/August 2008 issue of Harvard Business Review, McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson published the article ‚ÄúInvesting in the IT that Makes a Competitive Difference,‚Äù a summary of their research investigating IT's links to changes in competition. This work was the first to reveal that competition began to heat up in the US in the mid 1990s ‚Äì to become faster paced, more turbulent, and more winner- take-all ‚Äì and that this acceleration was greater in industries that spent more on IT. This research continues, and continues to highlight the fact that technology appears to be significantly reshaping the landscape of competition. =Books= McAfee's first book, Enterprise 2.0: New Collaborative Tools for Your Organization's Toughest Challenges, brings together case studies and examples with key concepts from economics, sociology, computer science, consumer psychology, and management studies of how leading organizations are incorporating the web's novel tools and philosophies. His second book, Race Against the Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy, co-authored with Erik Brynjolfsson, brings together a range of data, examples, and research to show that the average US worker is being left behind by advances in technology. In September 2014, he co-authored the book Leading Digital ‚Äì Turning Technology into Business Transformation, with George Westermann (MIT) and Didier Bonnet (Capgemini Consulting). In 2016 and 2018 McAfee cowrote two more books with Brynjolfsson, titled The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies and Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future respectively. In October 2019, Scribner published More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer Resources ‚Äî and What Happens Next. Recognition In 2008, the editors of the technical publishing house Ziff- Davis named McAfee number 38 in their list of the ‚Äú100 Most Influential People in IT‚Äù. He was also named by Baseline magazine to a separate, unranked list of the 50 most influential people in business IT that year. In 2009, he was the only non-executive in the Everything Channel's group of the 100 most influential executives in the technology industry. McAfee's blog is widely read, becoming at times one of the 10,000 most popular in the world (according to Technorati).

In July 2014, Lake and her coaches initially planned to have her compete in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, but decided against it and headed for the 2014 World Junior Championships in Eugene, Oregon instead. She began her campaign at the championships on 22 July with the 100 m hurdles, finishing fourth in the third heat and 12th overall with a time of 14.29 s. She stormed to the top of the heptathlon table with 2,096 points, setting a British junior record of 1.94 m in the heptathlon high jump. The only athlete to have cleared 1.85 m, she attempted a world youth record and British senior record height of 1.97 m, but failed to clear it. She began the afternoon session with a win in the heptathlon shot put, throwing 14.17 m to take her total to 2,901 points. She closed the day with the 200 m, finishing in third place both in the third heat and overall behind German world youth champion Celina Leffler and Dutch athlete Nadine Visser to end with a total of 3,821 points and remain at the top of the heptathlon table. Lake started the second day relatively poorly, finishing fourth in the heptathlon long jump in with a distance of 5.90 m. However, her total rose to 4,640 points, still enough to keep her at the top of the heptathlon table and in pole position for the gold medal. She finished in sixth place at the heptathlon javelin throw the same morning with a personal best of 41.66 m, but remained on top of the overall table with an additional 699 points to her total. Lake then closed the day with a seventh-place finish in the 800 m with a personal best time of 2:21.06, but secured the gold medal with a final total of 6,148 points, ahead of Cuban Yorgelis Rodr√≠guez and Visser, who went on to win bronze in the individual 100 m hurdles event on 28 July. On 27 July, the final day of the championships, Lake competed in the individual high jump event, and took her second gold medal with a height of 1.93 m. She and silver medallist Michaela Hrub√° of the Czech Republic were the only competitors to have managed to clear 1.91 m. Lake went on to make three attempts at 1.97 m as she did in the heptathlon high jump five days earlier, but again failed to set a new British senior record. =2016= On 18 August 2016, Lake competed in the Rio Olympics in the individual high jump event for Team GB, achieving a personal best of 1.94 m and reaching the final. In the finals, Lake successfully completed a height of 1.93 m coming joint 10th alongside Iryna Herashchenko and Inika McPherson. =2018= Lake finished fourth at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships, with a clearance of 1.93 metres, missing out on a medal on countback. A month later, she won a silver medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, with another clearance of 1.93 m. = 2019 = Lake was selected to represent Great Britain at the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar. She was eliminated during qualification after failing at 1.89m. =2020= She became British champion for the fifth successive year when winning the high jump event at the 2020 British Athletics Championships with a jump of 1.80 metres.

The country becomes privatized, the military is largely replaced by mercenaries and privately raised armies, and, after Washington, DC, is destroyed with a nuclear weapon, the Speaker of the House becomes dictator of the United States. During this time, Corbin achieves success in various businesses, a privately raised military force, and, eventually, into the federal government.

The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The specific age of the site is unknown. Some mounds were created by the Adena culture, while other mounds were built by the Hopewell culture. Location The site is located in Piketon, Ohio. As of 1848, the Chillicothe Turnpike traveled through the site and a cemetery was built upon the remains of a collection of mounds. The cemetery, named Mound Cemetery, as pictured to the right, remains in place today. Survey history =Squier and Davis: 1840s= The site was featured in the 1848 publication, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley by Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis. The two men visited the site. They call the side the Graded Way. They describe the graded way as being a type of earthwork seen \\"at various points at the West,\\" including at earthworks in Richmond Dale, Ohio and an additional site in Piketon. They also suggest that they are similar to earthworks found in Mexico. They state that grading ways are often seen \\"ascending sometimes from one terrace to another, and occasionally descending towards the banks of rivers or water-courses.\\" The graded way is noted as being 1,080 feet long, 215 feet wide in one section and 203 feet wide in another. They describe the site as having a graded ascent from a second terrace to a third terrace. The third terrace is 17 feet above the second. Various embankments were seen throughout the earthwork, ranging from 5 to eleven feet in height. At the 203 foot wide section of the grade, \\"the walls upon the interior sides measure no less than twenty-two feet in perpendicular height.\\" As of 1848, trees and bushes were covering the works, and Squier and Davis suggest that passerby would most likely see the site as just hills, not a man-made installation. A small embankment extended off of the right side of the graded way totaling 2,580 feet long. As of 1848, much of it was destroyed by the Chillicothe Turnpike. A wall was built, 1500 feet from the grade. It was built at a right angle and travel 212 feet. At that point, the line followed parallel to the main grade for 420 feet. It then curved in towards the grade and ended at a site of four mounds - three small and one large. Squier and Davis note that the small mounds were a cemetery at their time of visitation, a cemetery which remains there today. The large mound totaled 30 feet high. There were other small mounds and no more major mounds in the vicinity. On the left side of the graded way leads to the second terrace, which ends to a low area in the ground which is often filled with water. Squier and Davis cite that in the past it is believed that the Scioto River had passed through the area near the terrace. Based on their observations, Squier and Davis theorize about the use of the site as possibly a way to get from one terrace to the next. However, the embankments caused them to question that theory. In their report, they do not provide a set theory on what the site was used for. =Today= The site features four mounds which are located in a cemetery. Three of the mounds rise in size from two feet high to five feet high. The largest mound is 75 feet in diameter and 25 feet high. On previous excavations, one of the mounds was reported of housing a human skeleton of a girl wrapped in bark. The graded way remains, creating what the Ohio Historical Society describes as \\"a natural drainage channel,\\". The mounds are classic of Adena culture and the graded way is more known as being created by the Hopewell culture. This makes it hard to calculate a set date for the works.

He is regarded as a visual music filmmaker, as well as one of the first filmmakers to use electronic imagery (filmed oscilloscope patterns) in a film. Life and career Hy Hirsh was born in 1911 to Russian immigrants Max and Olga Hirsh. The family moved to Southern California in 1916 where Hy Hirsh developed an interest in filmmaking and photography. At age 19 he began working in Hollywood and was employed by Columbia Studios from 1930 to 1936 as a cameraman and still photographer. He began side work as an art photographer in 1932 and had his first solo exhibition in 1935. In 1936 Hirsh was employed as a photographer by President Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration, and in 1937 he turned to avant-garde cinema, playing a comic role in the satirical experimental film, Even‚ÄîAs You And I. In 1937, Hirsh moved to San Francisco where he became the official photographer for both the California Palace of the Legion of Honor and the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, where he photographed artwork, processed film and made prints. He also discreetly used the museum's darkroom for his own artistic pursuits until he left the museum in 1954. Throughout the 1940s Hirsh worked as a photographer and cinematographer. He collaborated with Sidney Peterson on several films, and after moving to San Francisco, gave technical advice and assistance to numerous abstract filmmakers, including Jordan Belson, Harry Smith, Frank Stauffacher, Patricia Marx and Larry Jordan. He participated in the creation of a number of films before starting to make his own abstract animated shorts in 1951. An avid jazz fan, Hirsh used the music of Thelonious Monk and the Modern Jazz Quartet, as well as African drumming and Caribbean carnival band to score his films. His love of music became so intertwined with his filmmaking that it is now regarded as \\"visual music. In 1955 Hirsh relocated to Paris and for a while to Amsterdam where he worked at a puppet animation studio. Commercial photography work for Vanity Fair, Elle, R√©alit√©s and other magazines enabled him to travel widely, and he spent some time in Spain. His home in his later years was Paris, France, where he continued his photography and to make experimental films. His shorts, Gyromorphosis (1956) and Autumn Spectrum (1957) won awards at the 1958 Brussels Experimental Film Competition. His films were sometimes accompanied by live jazz musicians and several projectors running at once. Hirsh's many talents led him to build his own optical printer, and he used then-new wire recording equipment to document live jazz. He also gained repute as a gourmet cook. He is alleged by film historian Willian Moritz to have produced some 15 documentaries for American television, though no documentation has ever been found. Hirsh died of a heart attack in 1961 in Paris. The opening credits of Walerian Borowczyk's short stop-motion film Renaissance (1963) include the caption \\"en hommage √° Hy Hirsh\\" (\\"in tribute to Hy Hirsh\\"). Personal life Hy Hirsh had one child, Diane, with Mae Agronowsky in 1934. The family lived together for two years before Hirsh left, finding traditional family life too confining. In 1939 he married Marie Gattman, a dancer and actress with whom he shared an interest in left-wing politics as well as his bohemian lifestyle. The couple lived in Los Angeles for a short time before moving to San Francisco's Haight Street. Photography style Hirsh's early photographs were influenced by California photography movement Group f/64, who had first exhibited in 1932 at the de Young Museum where Hirsh later worked. In 1932. Hirsh's photo work from that period used sharply focused black and white renderings and little manipulation in their process. Hirsh was then influenced by the social documentary of the Farm Security Administration photographers who recorded the impact of the Great Depression on displaced workers and their families. Hirsh followed suit, exploring social issues through visages of vacant lots, rusted machinery, and other images of urban decay. Recognition for these photographs led to seven exhibitions in Los Angeles and San Francisco from 1935 to 1955. A 1936 group show entitled \\"Seven Photographers\\" at L.A.'s Stanley Rose Gallery put him alongside the leading figures of West Coast photography, including Ansel Adams, Edward Weston and Brett Weston. Hirsh also appeared in the publication U.S. Camera in 1936, 1937 and 1939. In 1943 San Francisco Museum of Art featured Hirsh in a solo exhibition. By now Hirsh had moved away from the straight-ahead aesthetic of Ansel Adams and Group f64, and his artistic photography took more cues from the world of experimental film. He made surrealist self-portraits by superimposing negatives of himself with broken sheets of glass. Later in Paris, as a study for one of his films, he shot color slides of old wall posters that were peeling, exposing layers of posters underneath. Film technique According to some texts, Hirsh led a disorderly life, maintaining little interest in preserving or completing his own work. In his later career, some of his film screenings were live events with multiple projectors. He treated films as malleable objects by constantly editing and re-editing them, using live music instead of pre-recorded soundtracks. According to several texts by William Moritz, upon Hirsh's death in 1961 in Paris, the police found hashish in his apartment, and impounded all of Hirsh's property, including finished and unfinished films. When the police released the material three years later, many films and papers were missing. For his first film, Divertissement Rococo (1951), and several subsequent films, he employed filmed oscilloscope imagery. In Come Closer (1953), he acknowledged the then-current fad of 3-D film by layering multi-colored circular imagery, on 2 separate synched films for 3-D projection, intended to be viewed with 3-D glasses. This was later screened by Moritz and a few others as a single film, though it is correctly a 2-panel, 3D film. In Gyromorphosis (1954), 7 min, made in Amsterdam, Hy Hirsh displays the kinetic qualities of the New Babylon structures of Constant Nieuwenhuys. For Chasse de touches (\\"The Chase of Brushstrokes\\", 1959), Hirsh animated layers of colored oils, and in Autumn Spectrum (1957), used the movement of water and light in Amsterdam to create layers. In 1958 he filmed peeling walls and pieces of old posters in Paris for Defense d'Afficher (\\"Post No Bills\\"). In 1961, he scratched animated images over live-action footage for Scratch Pad, which incorporated imagery from previous films and found footage as well. Preservation Hirsh's surviving still photographic materials, including hundreds of slides (from Paris, Amsterdam, Spain and his later European years), color prints and gelatin silver prints, are in the archive of Center for Visual Music, Los Angeles. The Academy Film Archive has preserved a number of Hy Hirsh's films, including Autumn Spectrum, Chasse Des Touches, and Scratch Pad.

It has a capacity of 12,060 spectators and 5,500 individual plastic seats. History Desna at the Chernihiv Stadium during the match with Shakhtar Donetsk The history of Chernihiv Stadium dates back to 1936 for 3,000 spectators in eastern portion of a city park (garden) that exists since 1804. The territory of the city garden was chosen for the construction of the stadium. At the end of the 18th century there was a dacha of the Archbishop of Chernihiv on this territory. At the beginning of the 19th century, namely in 1804, a city garden was formed on the site of the modern stadium. During World War II, the Chernihiv Stadium was heavily damaged and in the 1950s was completely reconstructed, included stadium walls and two stands for 11,000 spectators. In 1961, it was named after the Russian Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. On 25 May 1964, Gagarin in person attended the stadium. In the mid 1980s, the stadium capacity was increased to 14,000. In 2005, the reconstruction of the stadium began, which was completed in 2008 with the assistance of the then sponsor of FC \\"Desna\\" Oleksiy Savchenko, in particular, plastic seats were installed on the west stand. In October 2011, the stadium received almost five million hryvnias for renovations.Gagarin Stadium in Chernihiv will be renovated . \\"Chernigovskaya Pravda\\".

We will also decide on the North Stand, we have invited experts who will assess its condition, whether it can be reconstructed or will have to be rebuilt, after which we will make the final decision. In the first stage, the spare and main fields will be completely replaced. Modern drainage systems, automatic lawn watering systems will be installed on both fields and a new lawn will be laid that will meet all the necessary standards. At the same time, the hotel for athletes is being renovated. ‚Äù The training ground is ready, after the match with Skala, which took place on September 26, Chernihiv footballers returned home, where they held their first full training session on the new field.

It is a neutral, stable compound. Kifunensine is a potent inhibitor of the mannosidase I enzyme and is primarily used in cell culture to make high mannose glycoproteins. Inside a cell, it prevents endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I (ERM1) from trimming mannose residues from precursor glycoproteins. Kifunensine shows no inhibitory action against mannosidase II or the endoplasmic reticulum alpha-mannosidase, and it weakly inhibits arylmannosidase. When incorporated in cell culture media, kifunensine has shown no significant impact on cell growth or glycoprotein production yield. Kifunensine has shown potential for treatment of sarcoglycanopathies and lysosomal storage disorders.  History  Kifunensine was first isolated by Iwami et al. in 1987, and described as a new type of immunoactive substance. It was originally prepared by culturing the actinobacterium Kitasatosporia kifunense in a suitable medium at 25‚Äì33 ¬∞C for several days, followed by extraction of the alkaloid. The structure of kifunensine was published in 1989 by Kayakiri et al.  Enzyme inhibition  Kifunensine is a potent inhibitor of the mannosidase I enzyme. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than deoxymannojirimycin ‚Äì an alkaloid with a similar structure. Kifunensine inhibits human endoplasmic reticulum Œ±-1,2-mannosidase I and Golgi Class I mannosidases IA, IB and IC with Ki values of 130 and 23 nM, respectively. Being a neutral molecule (cf other mannosidase inhibitors such as deoxymannojirimycin), it can permeate inside cells. Once inside a cell, kifunensine blocks endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mannosidase I (ERM1). This blocks processing of glycoproteins in the ER, to leave them with glycoforms with mainly nine mannose residues attached to two N-acetylglucosamine residues (Man9GlcNAc2). The addition of 5‚Äì20 ŒºM kifunensine to mammalian cell culture media is sufficient to achieve complete mannosidase I inhibition. Kifunensine does not inhibit mannosidase II or the endoplasmic reticulum alpha- mannosidase. It weakly inhibits arylmannosidase.  Synthesis  Kayakiri et al. published a synthesis of kifunensine from D-glucose in 1990 and a synthesis of 8-epi-kifunensine in 1991. A synthesis of kifunensine and some analogues, from L-ascorbic acid, was published by Hering et al. in 2005. Kifunensine is now made by GlycoSyn in a commercial process from N-acetylmannosamine in eight steps via a patented process.  Uses  = Production of high mannose glycoproteins in cell culture = Kifunensine's inhibitory action has led to its use in the preparation of high mannose glycoproteins by culture of transformed mammalian cells. It is easier to modify the glycosylation of a glycoprotein by using a culture media ingredient with an existing transformed cell line than by generating a new cell line ‚Äì especially if many cell lines or leads are being screened. = Therapeutic uses = Kifunensine's use as a therapeutic is currently being researched in several conditions that benefit from its ability to inhibit mannosidase I.  Sarcoglycanopathies  Sarcoglycanopathies are autosomal recessive muscular disorders of the Limb‚Äìgirdle Muscular Dystrophy (LMGD) group. Four forms, LGMD 2C, 2D, 2E and 2F have been identified, which result from defects in the Œ≥-, Œ±-, Œ≤- and Œ¥-sarcoglycan genes. There are fewer than 1,500 patients with sarcoglycanopathy in the European Union. In cell-based assays and in an animal model, kifunensine was found to be particularly suited to addressing LGMD 2D (R77C substitution), which has been diagnosed in patients in Europe, Africa, Japan and Brazil. Kifunensine was granted orphan drug status for the treatment of each of Œ≥-, Œ±-, Œ≤- and Œ¥-sarcoglycanopathy by the European Medicines Agency in October 2011. A patent for the treatment of sarcoglycanopathies is held by Genethon.http://www.google.com/patents/US20130035353 Claim 11 relates to the use of kifunensine as an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, particularly of mannosidase I. The development of kifunensine was put on hold due to side effects that need further analysis.F. Revah, CEO Genethon, 26 June 2014.  Lysosomal storage disorders  In the lysosomal storage disorders ‚Äì Gaucher's disease and Tay‚ÄìSachs disease ‚Äì endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) prevents the native folding of mutated lysosomal enzymes in a patient's fibroblasts. Kifunensine, given in very low concentration (50 nM), inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I and interferes with early substrate recognition, prolonged ER retention and substrate folding. It did not cause irremediably misfolded proteins to accumulate or induce apoptosis in the cells. In addition, the combination of ERAD inhibition using kifunensine with proteostasis modulation (MG-132 = Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al) to enhance the cellular folding capacity, resulted in the synergistic rescue of mutated enzymes. A patent held by William Marsh Rice University makes the following claims: * #9 : A method comprising administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of at least one inhibitor of ER-associated degradation * #10 : The method of claim 9 wherein the subject has Gaucher's disease or Tay‚ÄìSachs disease * #11 : The method of claim 9 wherein the inhibitor is eeyarestatin I or kifunensine.

He tended to paint scenes with throngs of people, and his favorite locations were in small towns in Russia, Asia, and the Taos Valley. He spent his youth in Russia and later studied in Paris, where he became a well-respected painter. He moved with his wife, American ballerina Evelyn Adell, to the United States. They eventually settled in Taos, New Mexico, though he continued to devote much of his time to traveling to paint in remote locations.Waters, Frank. Leon Gaspard. Northland Press, 1964. .Benezit Early life and education As a child, Gaspard traveled frequently with his father, who traded furs and fine rugs, throughout the Siberian Steppes. During these journeys, Gaspard began to sketch the wild, primitive world of the natives they met.Waters, p. 11. His mother, Zyra, was an accomplished pianist, and Gaspard's parents hoped he would take up music. Nonetheless, they encouraged his artistic interests.Lubbock, Texas.\\"Leon Gaspard: The Artist, the Land,\\" exhibition catalogue, The Museum of Texas Tech University: 1986. Gaspard pursued art studies in his hometown, Vitebsk, Belarus. He worked with Yehuda Pen, a well-known Jewish-Belarusian artist. Gaspard and Marc Chagall became friendly rivals over a girl named Bella Rosenfeld, who later became Chagall's wife. Gaspard pursued further studies in Odessa, and then his family sent him to Paris. He enrolled at the Acad√©mie Julian,Askart where he studied for almost eight years. He also worked independently with William-Adolphe Bouguereau. While he was in Paris, his parents died, which cut off his allowance, and abruptly ended his studies. However, Gaspard was able to sell a number of sketches to a dealer, and his career as an artist began. Personal life In 1908, Gaspard met Evelyn Adell, a wealthy American ballerina, who was living in Paris. She married him despite her parents' objections, and the couple embarked on an unusual honeymoon: a two-year horseback trip through Siberia.Waters, pgs. 22‚Äì23. Gaspard enlisted in the French Aviation Corps in 1914, and was seriously injured the following year.Waters, p. 26.San Francisco, 1967. \\"Leon Gaspard 1882 - 1964,\\" exhibition catalogue, Maxwell Galleries, LTD. Hogan and Kaus Lithograph Co: 1967. In a 1981 magazine article, in Artists of the Rockies and the Golden West, John Jellico writes that Gaspard leapt, without a parachute, from a falling plane. He landed in a shell hole filled with water and mud, which miraculously saved his life. Gaspard loved to tell stories about his colorful travels, many of which Frank Waters included in the 1964 biography, Leon Gaspard. For this reason, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish fact from story in regards to Gaspard's life, as he often wove elaborate tales with both words and paintings. Regardless of how Gaspard incurred the injury, historical evidence suggests that he was wounded in the war, and it inspired his move to New York. Later, he and his wife moved to Taos so he could recover in a warmer climate. Gaspard loved the wildness and cultural splendor in New Mexico, and he made Taos his permanent home from 1918 until his death in 1964. He continued to travel extensively to paint. In 1921 the Gaspard went to Japan, and journeyed throughout Asia. He left his wife in Peking, bought a pony, and traveled to inner Mongolia. He went through the Gobi desert, the mountains of Tien Shan, and the border of Tibet. The journey was two years and four months, and provided Gaspard with a lifetime of inspirational sketches.Waters, pgs. 48‚Äì69. Artistic career Gaspard found artistic success in Taos, where Gaspard moved in 1918 and remained until his death. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Gaspard continued to paint Russia, and far off places, rather than focus on the local Native Americans and landscape. Though an anomaly, Gaspard's work was respected; in 1961, Gaspard had a one- man show in Taos. His work sold steadily in New York City, Detroit, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and he was well-known and financially successful.Waters, p. 111. Posthumous reputation In 1965, the Museum of New Mexico's art museum held a retrospective exhibition of Gaspard in his memory. In 1967, three years after Gaspard's death, the Maxwell Galleries held a retrospective exhibition of his work. His post-humous reputation began to take shape in 1982, with a retrospective exhibition by the Fenn Galleries in Santa Fe (now Nedra Matteucci Galleries). In November 2013, Nedra Matteucci Galleries held another major exhibition for the artist, Leon Gaspard: Impressions from Russia and the Faraway. The following galleries have also held major posthumous exhibitions: Hammer Galleries, New York (1968), Gerald Peters Gallery, Santa Fe (1984), and Berry-Hill Galleries, New York (1986). Gaspard's work has sold well at auction houses, and in the early 2000s, prices for his paintings increased dramatically. On November 29, 2007, the 1918 painting, The Finish of the Kermesse was sold at Christie's for $2,001,000.

He has developed a number of restaurant chains, including P. F. Chang's China Bistro, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar, Pei Wei Asian Diner, Z‚ÄôTejas Grills, and Paul Martin's American Grill.  Early life  Fleming is a native of Franklin, Louisiana, and was raised in New Iberia, Louisiana. His parents were Betty Angers and Robert Martin Fleming, his father worked as a superior court judge. His grandfather was a farmer. Fleming's access to fresh, local produce as a child was a large influence on his restaurant career. Fleming graduated from both Louisiana State University and Loyola University. As a student at Loyola in New Orleans, Fleming first worked in the hospitality industry. When Fleming attended Louisiana State University, Fleming got his first restaurant job as a dishwasher at Saturday's. From there, he became busboy, server, bartender, and finally, the manager. Fleming raised a family with his wife, Kelly, in Arizona. They moved to Calistoga, California in Napa Valley, where Kelly made wine from the organic grapes Paul grew. They purchased the land in 1998, and in 2002 the Kelly Fleming Winery was founded. The couple are now divorced.  Career  Prior to working in restaurants, Fleming worked in the oil industry. When the oil industry collapsed, Fleming moved to Los Angeles. There, he began purchasing franchise rights to Ruth's Chris Steak House, which he acquired in three states: California, Arizona, and Hawaii. In 1984, Fleming opened his first Ruth's Chris in Beverly Hills. In 1985, he opened another in Phoenix. Fleming opened his third location in San Francisco and a fourth in Hawaii. He eventually sold all of the franchises back to Ruth's Chris. Along with business partner and friend Philip Chiang, Fleming co-founded P.F. Chang's China Bistro. The first of the now-cross-country restaurant chain appeared in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1993. The name P.F.Chang's is derived from the two founder's initials, the \\"F\\" standing for \\"Fleming.\\" He also conceptualized Pei Wei Asian Diner, a casual, quick-service offshoot of P.F. Chang's, that is no longer under Fleming's ownership. P.F. Chang's was sold in 2012 for $1.1 billion. Fleming's wife, Kelly, designed the interiors of Ruth's Chris steakhouses and P.F. Chang's. With partner Bill Allen, Fleming developed another restaurant chain that bears his name: Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar, which started in 1998 in Newport Beach, California. Fleming's is operated as a joint venture with Bloomin‚Äô Brands (NASDAQ:BLMN.O) and has grown to 65 locations across the U.S. In 2006, Fleming began tinkering with a new concept, Paul Martin's American Grill, with restaurant industry veteran Brian Bennett. Specializing in all-natural American cuisine, the first grill opened in 2007 in Roseville, California. In 2014, there were eight restaurants in California, one in Arizona, one in Austin, Texas, and one in Dallas, Texas. In 2019, Fleming made a minority investment in a Barcelona-inspired tapas restaurant Boqueria, as well as the Tex-Mex restaurant Tacos & Tequila Cantina.

On her three-year-old debut, the filly was made the 10/11 favourite for a maiden over one mile at Bath and won comfortably from ten opponents. In June she was assigned top weight of 131 Pound pounds in an all-aged handicap race at Thirsk Racecourse and won by three quarters of a length from the six-year-old Waterpark. In July she won her third race in succession when she took a seven furlong handicap at Newmarket but was then beaten into third place when contesting a more valuable handicap at Goodwood. Peeress was off the course for three months after her defeat at Goodwood and was then moved up in class for the Listed Fleur de Lys Stakes at Lingfield Park Racecourse. Racing on a Polytrack surface for the first time, she finished fourth of twelve runners, after her jockey Darryll Holland had been unab;e to obtain a clear run in the straight. She ended the year with a rating of 96, suggesting that she was approximately ten pounds below Group race class. =2005: four-year-old season= Peeress began her third season on the Listed Michael Seely Memorial Stakes over seven furlongs at York Racecourse in May. Ridden by Mick Kinane she started the 13/8 favourite and recorded her most important success up to that time as she won \\"readily\\" by two and a half lengths from Dumnoni. At Epsom Downs Racecourse in June she was moved up to Group Three class for the Princess Elizabeth Stakes but was beaten two lengths by the Godolphin filly Sundrop: Stoute later stated that she was unsuited by the course. The \\"Royal Ascot\\" meeting of 2005 was transferred to York, where Peeress was promoted to Group Two class for the Windsor Forest Stakes, in which her opponents included Sundrop, Soviet Song and Airwave. Starting a 14/1 outsider, Peeress was positioned just behind the leader by Kinane before moving forward in the last quarter mile. She overtook Sundrop 100 yards from the finish and won by two lengths, with Soviet Song, carrying five pounds more than the winner a further one and three quarter lengths further back in third. The first three from the Windsor Forest met again at level weights in Group One Falmouth Stakes at Newamrket three weeks later. Peeress disputed the lead for most of the way but was overtaken in the final furlong and finished third to Soviet Song and the Irish filly Alexander Goldrun. On 1 October, Peeress, ridden by the veteran Kevin Darley started at odds of 7/1 for the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. Her stable companion Chic was made favourite while her other opponents included the previous Group One winners Virginia Waters, Maid's Causeway (Coronation Stakes) and Favourable Terms (Nassau Stakes). The ten fillies split into three group across the width of the straight course, with Darley positioning Peeress on the rail furthest from the stands. Two furlongs from the finish Peeress took the overall lead and stayed on to win by one and a half lengths from the 50/1 outsider Summitville. Michael Stoute described the winner as \\"a tough performer\\" who had been particularly well suited by the soft ground conditions. Two weeks later, Peeress was moved down in distance for the Challenge Stakes at the same course and, carrying a four pound weight penalty for her Group One win, finished fourth of the fifteen runners behind La Vie dei Colori. =2006-2007: five- and six-year-old seasons= Peeress remained in training as a five-year-old, beginning her season in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury Racecourse in May. She once again ran on her favoured soft ground in a race which was made more of a stamina test by a strong headwind. Ridden by Kieren Fallon, she was made the 4/1 second favourite, with Soviet Song heading the betting at 7/2. Fallon restrained the mare towards the back of the nine runner field in the early stages before taking the lead approaching the final furlong. Peeress won her second successive Group One race by one and three quarter lengths from Major's Cast with Court Masterpiece three and a half lengths away in third. The Cheveley Park Stud's director, Chris Richardson said \\"like so many Pivotals, she has matured physically with age. She also has one of those wonderful relaxed temperaments.\\" Stoute commented; \\"Last year Peeress improved throughout the season. She did it as a 4-year-old and now she has upped a gear again. Once Kieren asked her to go she won it quickly.\\" At Royal Ascot, Peeress started favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes but finished fourth to the colt Ad Valorem, having been bumped by the winner inside the final furlong. Chris Richardson commented; \\"I think she has been very unlucky... she didn‚Äôt deserve to be squeezed up like that. It was a messy race.\\" She returned to all-female competition at Newmarket in July and finished fourth to three-year-old Rajeem in the Falmouth Stakes. In August, the mare competed internationally for the first time in the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville Racecourse. In a closely contested finish she was beaten a head and a neck into third by Librettist and Manduro, with Ad Valorem and Ramonti among the unplaced runners. On next appearance she was sent to Ireland for the Matron Stakes at the Curragh. Ridden by Ryan Moore, she finished strongly, but failed by a short head to catch the three-year-old Red Evie. She was expected to start favourite to win a second Sun Chariot Stakes but was withdrawn on the morning of the race when she was found to be running an abnormal temperature. In May 2007, Peeress, now a six-year-old, attempted to repeat her 2006 victory in the Lockinge Stakes, but despite starting favourite, she ran disappointingly, finishing seventh of the eight runners behind Red Evie. It was the first time in her eighteen races that Peeress had finished worse than fourth and her retirement to stud was announced a week later. Commenting on the decision, Richardson said that \\"Peeress owes us absolutely nothing and has been a great servant to the stud, and hopefully she will do just as well in her new career.\\" Assessment In the 2006 edition of the World Thoroughbred Rankings, Peeress was given a rating of 117, making her the 72nd best racehorse in the world and the fifth best older female. Stud record Peeress was retired from racing to become a broodmare for the Cheveley Park Stud. Her first two foals to race have both been winners: Ladyship, a filly sired by Oasis Dream has won two races included the Listed City Plate at Chester Racecourse, while Enobled [sic], a colt by Dansili won a maiden race at Goodwood in 2013.

The facility is situated at Portland Bill, where tests can be performed well away from stray electric and magnetic fields. History The site was chosen during the 1960s for magnetic measurement due to Portland Bill's remoteness and magnetic cleanliness. As Portland stone is non-magnetic, as well as the site's remoteness, the site is free from any magnetic disturbance such as heavy traffic, and as a result, very small magnetic fields from equipment can be measured with a very high degree of accuracy. The site is used to magnetically assess any item, but mainly MCMV and EOD equipment. Magnetic compasses can also be tested. The unique facility is both notified and approved by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and is the only accredited centre for Type Approval of Magnetic Compasses and Binnacles in the United Kingdom. The site holds various facilities. The main Land Magnetic Range is a secure and magnetically stable environment, used to measure the magnetic fields found in Mine Counter Measure Vessel equipment. The range uses inbuilt coil systems which enable the Earth's magnetic field to be reduced to zero, simulate anywhere on the planet, or provide only the vertical or horizontal portion of the Earth field to pass through the item under test, which an equivalent Sea Range cannot do. The Compass Test Centre inspects and tests magnetic compasses, whilst also delivering them to RAF stations across the UK. The Compass Base Calibration Surveys is a designated area of survey and certification, used for accurate swinging of Aircraft Navigation Equipment for both military and civilian airfields.

Its establishment was linked to a World Bank study and investment promotion event in May 2005 (\\"Invest and Live in Ras Al Khaimah\\") initiated and pursued by the Swiss-Lebanese engineer Khater Massaad who was a long-time adviser to Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr Al-Qasimi, the creator of RAK Ceramics and the longtime CEO of RAKIA. Khater Massaad, then CEO of RAKIA, at the October 2011 Horasis Global Arab Business Meeting Sectors under development include industrial parks, education and technology, real estate, transportation, manufacturing and energy, as well as offshore operations and other investments. Contrary to popular opinion, RAKIA is not a proper sovereign wealth fund (SWF) that would rely for example on steady income from oil or gas. Instead, RAKIA is an industrial licensing and promotion agency to attract investments into Ras Al-Khaimah. The Government of Ras Al Khaimah as the owner or RAKIA raises funds from financial markets and passes this borrowed money on to RAKIA. Services As per the Emiri Decree No. (32) of 2012 issued by Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr Al-Qasimi, the scope of services offered by RAKIA includes: * issuing of all types of business licenses operating in the industrial parks and free zones belonging to RAKIA * providing facilities for business (industrial land, warehouse, office space etc.) * issuing licenses for offshore companies Investments abroad RAKIA investments abroad include operations in Georgia, notably shares in Poti Sea Port (directly through RAKIA in the UAE), in the Sheraton Metechi Palace Hotel in the capital Tbilisi (through its subsidiary RAKIA Georgia LLC), and the Poti Port Free Industrial Zone (through the subsidiary RAKIA Georgia FIZ LLC). In both Georgian entities, 15 percent of RAKIA shares were alienated in 2011 to the UK based Manline Projects LLP owned by Georgian businessman Gela (\\"Zaza\\") Mikadze.National Agency of the Public Registry https://enreg.reestri.gov.ge/main.php?m=new_index&state;=search RAKIA's Sheraton Metechi Palace Hotel in the capital Tbilisi was sold to an Iranian investor in December 2011 but payments for this transaction have not yet been completed as of July 2013. Controversies Although Ras Al Khaimah is a poorer sheikhdom in the north of the UAE, Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi had instructed RAKIA to invest in Georgia a few years prior to his accession as ruler of Ras Al Khaimah in 2010. Against the background of Saud's dispute with his half-brother Sheikh Khaled bin Saqr Al Qasimi concerning each other's claims to the throne, these investments were interpreted as hedging against a possible failure of Saud's bid for leadership in Ras Al Khaimah. In the event of failure, Sheikh Saud had planned having large assets outside the UAE. That his succession was far from being certain is confirmed by the fact that it took a light military intervention of Abu Dhabi federal troops to ensure Saud's claim over the one of his elder half-brother Khaled when their father Sheikh Saqr bin Muhammad Al Qasimi died in October 2010. Once in power, Saud faced the impact of the Dubai financial crisis on public finances as well as homegrown discontent, notably in the form of the Al-Islah movement that demanded public participation and accountability in the UAE in general and in Ras Al Khaimah in particular. The Al-Islah movement represented the UAE variation of political uprisings in the region commonly summarized under the Arab Spring. The domestic challenges prompted Saud to adopt a general policy of selling all assets held abroad and not engaging in future investments outside Ras Al Khaimah. One of the leaders of the Al-Islah movement, Saud's long-time legal adviser Muhammad Al-Mansuri (Mohammad Al-Mansoori), was tried among the so-called \\"UAE 94\\" political activists. On 2 July 2013 he was one of 68 government critics convicted by the State Security Court in Abu Dhabi of ‚Äúplotting to overthrow the state‚Äù. He received a ten years jail term in a judicial process described by international observers as grossly unfair. Lack of funding for a projected Real Madrid resort island in Ras Al Khaimah In June 2013, the highly advertised plans to build a 1 billion USD Real Madrid resort island in Ras Al Khaimah had to be cancelled due to the lack of funding. The project, announced only in March 2012, was supposed to be a joint venture between the Spanish football team, the government of Ras Al Khaimah and the Luxembourg-based RAK Marjan Island Football Investment Fund. RAKIA confirmed that the resort stood no chance of opening. In addition to the financial deficiencies, the project had come under criticism in international sports circles, as Real Madrid was required by Ras Al Khaimah to remove the Christian symbol of the little cross from the crown atop their logo on all the project's promotional materials to conform with Muslim beliefs.

She is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of BUILD, a national nonprofit dedicated to increasing high school graduation and college enrollment rates through entrepreneurship. Early life and education Her induction into the Ashoka Global Fellowship is indicative of her legacy and impact as social entrepreneur. She credits her inclination towards social entrepreneurship to the combination of adults that played a role during her early childhood. Her mother was a teacher in Harlem. Her Scottish father grew up poor, but through dedication and perseverance, became a successful businessman. Klahr's parents, although divorced when Klahr was young, both encouraged her to invest in others while at the same time judiciously managing time and resources. Klahr was an entrepreneur from a very young age. Klahr's grandmother also guided Klahr's path toward social entrepreneurship. In her late 60s, newly widowed, Klahr's grandmother earned a degree in gerontology and began a non-profit, Elder Concern, which addressed the needs of senior citizens. Klahr launched multiple businesses as a child growing up in Manhattan. In primary school, she sold her used toys on the street. In elementary school, she wrote and published \\"Little Apples for Young New Yorkers,\\" a newspaper marketed towards children. As a teen, Klahr launched and ran an earring business, ‚ÄúBeaudangles by Suzanne‚Äù. She also devoted her time to volunteering with elderly citizens. In high school at Riverdale Country School, Klahr took an interest in human rights work and built her high school‚Äôs Amnesty International chapter. As an undergraduate at Brown University, she interned at the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. Klahr completed her undergraduate studies at Brown University in 1994 and worked at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo PCin Boston, MA where she was inspired by the firm's commitment to investing its time in underserved communities and those historically disenfranchised. After graduating from Stanford Law School in 1999, Klahr was awarded the prestigious Skadden Fellowship from the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, which provided her with the funding to begin the BUILD program. At Stanford Law School she was president of the Public Interest Law Students Association but describes herself as \\"always on the fence between the public and private sectors.\\" While pursuing a law degree at Stanford University, she provided pro bono legal services to impoverished adults through the East Palo Alto Community Law Project. She witnessed first hand that the majority of residents lacked access to the information, networks and institutions that allow people to make socioeconomic progress. She also noticed in East Palo Alto that many of the people seeking legal help also sought assistance in launching their own businesses. Disappointed by the gap between East Palo Alto's poorer residents and the affluent in Silicon Valley, she set out to close this gap and create systemic change.
