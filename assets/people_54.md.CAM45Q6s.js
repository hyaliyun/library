It was located between Highgate and Muswell Hill stations at the junction of Muswell Hill Road and Cranley Gardens. Nothing remains of the station today and its site is now occupied by housing and a school. In the 1930s plans were made to electrify the line and transfer the mainline service to London Underground's Northern line, but these were abandoned after the Second World War. The station closed for passengers in 1954 and goods in 1957. History Great Northern Railway's Northern Heights branches, 1900 The branch line from the Great Northern Railway's (GNR's) station at Highgate to Alexandra Palace was built by the Muswell Hill Railway (MHR) and opened on 24 May 1873. Cranley Gardens station opened on 2 August 1902. In 1911, the line was taken over by the GNR. After the 1921 Railways Act created the Big Four railway companies, the line was, from 1923, part of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER). The LNER closed the station on 1 December 1930, and reopened it in July 1932. In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) planned, as part of its \\"Northern Heights plan\\" to take over the line from LNER together with the LNER's routes from Finsbury Park to Edgware and High Barnet. The line was to be modernised to use electric trains and amalgamated with the Northern line. At Finsbury Park the line was to be connected to the Northern line's Northern City branch so that services from Cranley Gardens would have continued to Moorgate. Works to modernise the track began in the late 1930s and were well advanced when they were halted by the Second World War. Works were completed from Highgate to High Barnet and Mill Hill East and that section was incorporated into the Northern line. Works on the tracks between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace were halted and the LNER continued to be operate the line. In 1942, LNER services through Cranley Gardens were reduced to rush hour only operations. After the war, no work was carried out as maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on LPTB funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority was given to the completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights plan. British Railways (the successor to the LNER) closed the line temporarily from 29 October 1951 until 7 January 1952, before the last passenger services ran between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace on 3 July 1954. The line continued to be used for goods services until 18 May 1957 when it was closed completely. The track was subsequently removed and the buildings were demolished. The station buildings and platforms remained until demolished in the late 1960s and a school now occupies the site. The trackbed between Muswell Hill and Finsbury Park is now the Parkland Walk.

It was located between Finsbury Park station and Crouch End station on a bridge over Stapleton Hall Road. The station had platforms (now demolished) cantilevered from the bridge structure and a wooden station building (also now demolished) at ground level under and on either side of the bridge, with a station master's house to the north of it. The bridge still exists, and now carries the Parkland Walk cycle and pedestrian path, whilst the station master's house serves as a community centre. The Gospel Oak to Barking line of Network Rail passes under both Stapleton Hall Road and the Stroud Green station site in a tunnel, between Crouch Hill and Harringay Green Lanes stations, and can be seen from the former platforms of Stroud Green station. The station site is within the area of the London Borough of Haringey, close to that borough's boundary with that of Islington. History Stroud Green station on a 1920 map The station master's house (2010) The station was built by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and opened on the railway's existing Edgware, Highgate and London Line on 11 April 1881. The line ran from Finsbury Park to Edgware via Highgate with branches to Alexandra Palace and High Barnet. After the 1921 Railways Act created the Big Four railway companies, the line was, from 1923, part of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER). In 1935 London Underground planned, as part of its \\"New Works Programme\\" to take over the line from LNER, modernise it for use with electric trains and amalgamate it with the Northern line. Works to modernise the track began in the late 1930s and were well advanced when they were interrupted and halted by the Second World War. Works were completed from Highgate to High Barnet and Mill Hill East and that section was incorporated into the Northern line between 1939 and 1941. Further works on the section between Finsbury Park, Highgate and Alexandra Palace were postponed and the line continued under the operation of the LNER. After the war the dwindling passenger numbers and a shortage of funds lead to the cancellation of the unfinished works in 1950. British Railways (the successor to the LNER) closed the line temporarily from 29 October 1951 until 7 January 1952. Passenger services to Stroud Green station were ended by British Railways after the last train on 3 July 1954 along with the rest of the line between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace. The line continued to be used for goods into the 1960s and by London Underground for train stock movements until 6 October 1970 when it was completely closed. The station buildings were gutted by a fire on 3 February 1967, and were demolished shortly thereafter. The track was lifted in 1972, and the track bed between Muswell Hill and Finsbury Park reused as the Parkland Walk, which opened in 1984. The station master's house, located next to the now demolished station building, was converted for community use.

The dusky caenolestid is characterized by a dark brown coat with a lighter underbelly, soft and thick fur, and a loosely haired tail. A nocturnal animal (active mainly at night), the dusky caenolestid lives on trees and feeds on insects and small invertebrates and vertebrates. It occurs in alpine and p√°ramo forests in northern and western Colombia, Ecuador, and western Venezuela. The IUCN classifies this shrew opossum as least concern. Taxonomy and etymology The dusky caenolestid is one of the five members of Caenolestes, and is placed in the family Caenolestidae (shrew opossums). It was first described by English zoologist Robert Fisher Tomes as Hyracodon fuliginosus in 1863. It was given its present binomial name by English zoologist Oldfield Thomas in 1895. In the latter part of 20th century, scientists believed that Caenolestes is closely related to Lestoros (the Incan caenolestid). Over the years, it became clear that Lestoros is morphologically different from Caenolestes. A 2013 morphological and mitochondrial DNA-based phylogenetic study showed that the Incan caenolestid and the long-nosed caenolestid (Rhyncholestes raphanurus) form a clade sister to Caenolestes. The cladogram below is based on this study. Three subspecies are recognized: *C. f. centralis Bublitz, 1987: Occurs in the Andean natural region (Colombia) and extreme west of Venezuela. *C. f. fuliginosus (Tomes, 1863): Occurs in central Ecuador. *C. f. obscurus Thomas, 1895: Occurs around Bogot√° (Colombia). Caenolestid fossils date to as early as the early Eocene (nearly 55 mya). The generic name Caenolestes derives from the Greek words kainos (\\"new\\") and lestes (\\"robber\\", \\"pirate\\"). Description The dusky caenolestid is characterized by a dark brown coat with a lighter underbelly, soft and thick fur, and a loosely haired tail. The head-and-body length is between , the tail measures and hindfeet are long. The ears and eyes are smaller and the rostrum is longer than in other caenolestids. The forefeet have five digits each; while two of them are blunt, the other three digits bear sharp claws. The toes of the hindfeet bear sharp claws as well, except for the biggest toe. There are four teats and no pouch. A 2007 study recorded dental anomalies such as missing teeth and supernumerary teeth. Ecology and behavior The dusky caenolestid is nocturnal (active mainly at night), and lives on trees. It can be a fast runner, like the Incan caenolestid, though it does not move in leaps and jumps. The dusky caenolestid is reported to have a poor vision, though its sense of smell and hearing are good. Diet consists of lepidopteran larvae, insects, rodents, arachnids and centipedes; plant material may be eaten as well. The tail, though prehensile, may not be able to support the animal when it hangs down a branch. Distribution and status The dusky caenolestid inhabits alpine and p√°ramo forests in northern and western Colombia, Ecuador, and western Venezuela. It can occur in an altitudinal range of above the sea level. The IUCN classifies it as least concern given its wide distribution and presumably large numbers. The caenolestid faces competition from the wandering small-eared shrew, and is thus rare, in montane regions of Ecuador. Cattle grazing is a major factor in habitat degradation.

It is part of cognitive science, and is a distinct cognitive bias that occurs once a decision is made. For example, if a person chooses option A instead of option B, they are likely to ignore or downplay the faults of option A while amplifying or subscribing new negative faults to option B. Conversely, they are also likely to notice and amplify the advantages of option A and not notice or de-emphasize those of option B. What is remembered about a decision can be as important as the decision itself, especially in determining how much regret or satisfaction one experiences. Research indicates that the process of making and remembering choices yields memories that tend to be distorted in predictable ways. In cognitive science, one predictable way that memories of choice options are distorted is that positive aspects tend to be remembered as part of the chosen option, whether or not they originally were part of that option, and negative aspects tend to be remembered as part of rejected options. Once an action has been taken, the ways in which we evaluate the effectiveness of what we did may be biased. It is believed this may influence our future decision-making. These biases may be stored as memories, which are attributions that we make about our mental experiences based on their subjective qualities, our prior knowledge and beliefs, our motives and goals, and the social context. True and false memories arise by the same mechanism because when the brain processes and stores information, it cannot tell the difference where they came from. General definition The tendency to remember one's choices as better than they actually were. In this respect, people tend to over attribute positive features to options they chose and negative features to options not chosen. Theory Experiments in cognitive science and social psychology have revealed a wide variety of biases in areas such as statistical reasoning, social attribution, and memory. Choice-supportive memory distortion is thought to occur during the time of memory retrieval and was the result of the belief that, \\"I chose this option, therefore it must have been the better option.\\" Essentially, after a choice is made people tend to adjust their attitudes to be consistent with, the decision they have already made. It is also possible that choice-supportive memories arise because an individual is only paying attention to certain pieces of information when making a decision or to post- choice cognitive dissonance. In addition, biases can also arise because they are closely related to the high level cognitive operations and complex social interactions. Memory distortions may sometimes serve a purpose because it may be in our interest to not remember some details of an event or to forget others altogether. Making a selection The objective of a choice is generally to pick the best option. Thus, after making a choice, a person is likely to maintain the belief that the chosen option was better than the options rejected. Every choice has an upside and a downside. The process of making a decision mostly relies upon previous experiences. Therefore, a person will remember not only the decision made but also the reasoning behind making that decision. =Motivation= Motivation may also play a role in this process because when a person remembers the option that they chose as being the best option, it should help reduce regret about their choice. This may represent a positive illusion that promotes well-being. =Cases when the individual is not in control= There are cases where an individual is not always in control of which options are received. People often end up with options that were not chosen but, instead were assigned by others, such as job assignments made by bosses, course instructors assigned by a registrar, or vacation spots selected by other family members. However, being assigned (random or not) to an option leads to a different set of cognitions and memory attributions that tend to favor the alternative (non-received) option and may emphasize regret and disappointment. *Assigned options: Making a choice or having a choice made for you by other people in your best interest can prompt memory attributions that support that choice. Current experiments show no choice-supportive memory bias for assigned options. However, choices which are made on a person's behalf in their best interest do show a tendency for choice-supportive memory bias. *Random selection: People do not show choice- supportive biases when choices are made randomly for them. This is because choice-supportive memory bias tends to arise during the act of making the decision.  How different forms of misremembering create different types of choice-supportive biases  = Misattribution = Misattribution is a well- known commission error supported by researchers. It results in a type of choice-supportive bias when information is attributed to the wrong source. Consequently, the positive attributes of the forgone option are remembered as the positive attributes of the chosen option, or the negative attributes of the chosen option are remembered as the negative attributes of the foregone option. For example, if one had to choose between two pairs of trainers and the chosen pair fitted slightly tighter and the forgone option fitted perfectly, the chosen pair would be remembered as fitting perfectly whereas the forgone pair would be remembered as being slightly tighter (although this was not the case in reality) While misattribution presupposes correct encoding and recall of the information in relation to a person‚Äôs decision, the source of the information remains unclear or incorrect. Therefore it is not to be mistaken with completely false information. = Fact distortion = Fact distortion results in a type of choice-supportive bias when the facts belonging to the chosen option are remembered in a distorted manner. The distortion refers to the objective values and/or features of the chosen option being misremembered in a more preferential way to their actual values. Alternatively, the forgone option can be misremembered as being significantly less preferential then their actual values. An example of fact distortion would be if you have to choose between buying one out of two cars which can both drive at a maximum speed of 130 mph, the foregone car would be remembered with a maximum speed of 100 mph, whereas the chosen car will be remembered with a maximum speed of 160 mph. Consequently, the facts concerning both cars have been distorted. There are varieties of fact distortion that remain contested throughout the literature; as a result, there is no consensus on how it works. Some authors argue that the distortion mainly occurs when the favoured option is misremembered more preferentially, whereas other researchers argue that memory distortion does not occur or is only likely to take place during the post-decision stage. Overall, some studies have argued that holding the belief that distortion cannot take place (as soon as the decision is made) means that facts cannot be distorted. = Selective forgetting = Selective forgetting results in a form of choice-supportive bias when information is selectively forgotten. In this respect, the positive attributes of the chosen option and the negative attributes of the forgone option are retained in memory at a higher rate and the alternatives are displaced from memory at a faster rate. An example of selective forgetting would be correctly remembering that your chosen pair of trainers were aesthetically pleasing, but forgetting that they were slightly tight. This omission error may be related to the limited capacity of memory overtime, otherwise known as transience. = False memory = False memory in the context of choice-supportive biases is when items that were not part of the original decision are remembered as being presented. If these entirely new items are positive, they will be remembered as belonging to the chosen option and if they are negative, they will be remembered as belonging to the forgone option. For example, a chosen pair of shoes might be remembered as good for running, although there was no information presented in respect to the shoes running capabilities. This type of error is fundamentally different to the other types of misremembering in choice-supportive bias because it is not due to correct encoding and later confusion, but it is due to a completely false memory. This type of bias means that falsely remembered events can affect future attitudes and possibly decision-making.  Potential influential factors  = Alignability = Alignability in the context of choice- supportive bias refers to whether both options have directly comparable features. For example, an alignable characteristic could be whether both options can be measured in centimetres. In the context of decision making, alignability can influence choices or the ability to make a similarity judgement of a potential option. The alignment process enables a person to draw similarities and difference which impact their choice-supportive biases. Research to support this can be displayed by the following example: when given a choice between two brands of popcorn, participants were more likely to choose the one with the superior alignable differences, such as ‚Äúpops in its own bag‚Äù compared with ‚Äúrequires a microwaveable bowl‚Äù than the one with superior non-alignable differences, such as ‚Äúnot likely to burn‚Äù compared with those containing ‚Äúsome citric acid\\" = Delay = The extent of the delay between encoding is a potential factor that could affect choice-supportive bias. If there is a larger delay between encoding (i.e. viewing the information about the options) and retrieval (i.e. memory tests) it is likely to result in more biased choices rather than the impact of the actual choice on choice-supportive bias. Some studies have found that the extent of false memories increases over time. Whereas other researchers have shown that a 2-day delay between making choices and assessment of memory resulted in reasonably high (86%) recognition accuracy. Therefore, these findings indicate that the influence of delays on choice-supportive bias remain varied, and the influence of delays could affect different types of memory distortions differently. = Beliefs about the choices one has made = This factor refers to a persons perceived decisions concerning the choices they made, more specifically this includes memories that have been falsified to reflect a selected choice that the person did not actually make. Research illustrates that people favour the options they think they have chosen and remember the attributes of their \\"chosen choice\\" more vividly and favourably. Essentially, this influences assesses how one believes the choices they made affects their subsequent memories. As a result, peoples memories are biased in favour of the option they thought they had selected rather than their actual choices. = Individual differences = Individual differences in choice-supportive bias affect the way a person remembers their options and the way they make decisions and therefore it may influence the degree to which a person engages in choice-supportive bias. Factors such as age and individual characteristics can influence an individuals cognitive abilities, personality and thus their overall choice-supportive biases. For example, it has been observed by correlations that people with better performance in tests of frontal or executive functioning were less prone to choice-supportive memory. Relation to self People's conception of who they are, can be shaped by the memories of the choices they make; the college favored over the one renounced, the job chosen over the one rejected, the candidate elected instead of another one not selected. Memories of chosen as well as forgone alternatives can affect one's sense of well-being. Regret for options not taken can cast a shadow, whereas satisfaction at having made the right choice can make a good outcome seem even better. =Positive illusions= Choice-supportive bias often results in memories that depict the self in an overly favorable light. In general, cognitive biases loosen our grasp on reality because the line between reality and fantasy can become fuzzy if one's brain has failed to remember a particular event. Positive illusions are generally mild and are important contributors to our sense of well being. However, we all need to be aware that they do exist as part of human nature. Memory storage Human beings are blessed with having an intelligent and complex mind, which allows us to remember our past, be able to optimize the present, and plan for the future. Remembering involves a complex interaction between the current environment, what one expects to remember, and what is retained from the past. The mechanisms of the brain that allow memory storage and retrieval serves us well most of the time, but occasionally gets us into trouble. =Memories change over time= There is now abundant evidence that memory content can undergo systematic changes. After some period of time and if the memory is not used often, it may become forgotten. *Memory retention: It is recognized that retention is best for experiences that are pleasant, intermediate for experiences that are unpleasant, and worst for experiences that are neutral. Generic memories provide the basis for inferences that can bring about distortions. These distortions in memory do not displace an individual's specific memories, but they supplement and fill in the gaps when the memories are lost. It has been shown that a wide variety of strategic and systematic processes are used to activate different areas of the brain in order to retrieve information. *Credibility of a memory: People have a way to self- check memories, in which a person may consider the plausibility of the retrieved memory by asking themselves is this event even possible. For example, if a person remembers seeing a pig fly, they must conclude that it was from a dream because pigs cannot fly in the real world. Memory does not provide people with perfect reproductions of what happened, it only consists of constructions and reconstructions of what happened. Brain areas of interest There is extensive evidence that the amygdala is involved in effectively influencing memory. Emotional arousal, usually fear based, activates the amygdala and results in the modulation of memory storage occurring in other brain regions. The forebrain is one of the targets of the amygdala. The forebrain receives input from amygdala and calculates the emotional significance of the stimulus, generates an emotional response, and transmits it to cerebral cortex. This can alter the way neurons respond to future input, and therefore cognitive biases, such as choice-supportive bias can influence future decisions. =Stress hormones affect memory= Effects of stress-related hormones, such as epinephrine and glucocorticoids are mediated by influences involving the amygdala. It has been shown in experiments with rats that when they are given systemic injections of epinephrine while being trained to perform a task, they show an enhanced memory of performing the task. In effect the stronger the emotion that is tied to the memory, the more likely the individual is to remember. Therefore, if the memory is stored and retrieved properly it is less likely to be distorted. Brain mapping A PET scan or fMRI can be used to identify different regions of the brain that are activated during specific memory retrieval. =fMRI study= *True versus false memories: One study asked subjects to remember a series of events while being monitored by an fMRI to see which areas \\"light up\\". When an individual remembered a greater number of true memories than false memories, it showed a cluster spanning the right superior temporal gyrus and lateral occipital cortex. However, when the reverse occurred (when an individual remembered a greater number of false memories than true) the brain area that showed activation was the left insula. These findings may provide some insight as to which areas of the brain are involved with storing memories and later retrieving them. Influence of age Studies now show that as people age, their process of memory retrieval changes. Although general memory problems are common to everyone because no memory is perfectly accurate, older adults are more likely than younger adults to show choice-supportive biases. =Aging of the brain= Normal aging may be accompanied by neuropathy in the frontal brain regions. Frontal regions help people encode or use specific memorial attributes to make source judgments, controls personality and the ability to plan for events. These areas can attribute to memory distortions and regulating emotion. =Regulation of emotion= In general, older adults are more likely to remember emotional aspects of situations than are younger adults. For example, on a memory characteristic questionnaire, older adults rated remembered events as having more associated thoughts and feelings than did younger adults. As a person ages, regulating personal emotion becomes a higher priority, whereas knowledge acquisition becomes less of a powerful motive. Therefore, choice-supportive bias would arise because their focus was on how they felt about the choice rather than on the factual details of the options. Studies have shown that when younger adults are encouraged to remember the emotional aspect of a choice, they are more likely to show choice-supportive bias. This may be related to older adults' greater tendency to show a positivity effect in memory. =Rely on familiarity= Older adults rely more than younger adults on categorical or general knowledge about an event to recognize particular elements from the event. Older adults are also less likely to correctly remember contextual features of events, such as their color or location. This may be because older adults remember (or rely on) fewer source identifying characteristics than the young. Consequently, older adults must more often guess or base a response on less specific information, such as familiarity. As a result, if they can't remember something, they are more likely to fill in the missing gaps with things that are familiar to them. =Getting the 'gist'= Older adults are more reliant on gist-based retrieval. A number of studies suggest that using stereotypes or general knowledge to help remember an event is less cognitively demanding than relying on other types of memorial information and thus might require less reflective activity. This shift towards gist-based processes might occur as a compensation for age decrements in verbatim memory. =Inhibition= The episodic memory and inhibition accounts of age-related increases in false memories. Inhibition of a memory may be related to an individual's hearing capacity and attention span. If the person cannot hear what is going on around them or is not paying much attention, the memory cannot be properly stored and therefore cannot be accurately retrieved. Examples =Deciding between two used cars= Henkel and Mather tested the role of beliefs at the time of retrieval about which option was chosen by giving participants several hypothetical choices like deciding between two used cars. After making several choices, participants left and were asked to return a week later. At that point, Henkel and Mather reminded them which option they had chosen for each choice and gave them a list of the features of the two options; some new positive and negative features were mixed in with the old features. Next, participants were asked to indicate whether each option was new, had been associated with the option they chose, or had been associated with the option they rejected. Participants favored whichever option Henkel and Mather had told them they had chosen in their memories. These findings show that beliefs at the time of retrieval about which option was chosen shape both which features are attributed to the options and how vividly they are remembered. =Remembering high school grades= One study looked at the accuracy and distortion in memory for high school grades. The relation between accuracy and distortion of autobiographical memory content was examined by verifying 3,220 high school grades recalled by 99 freshman college students. It was shown that most errors inflated the actual high school grade, meaning that these distortions are attributed to memory reconstructions in a positive and emotionally gratifying direction. In addition, their findings indicate that the process of distortion does not cause the actual unpleasant memory loss of getting the bad grade. This is because there was no correlation found between the percentage of accuracy recall and the degree of asymmetry, or distortion. This shows that the distortion in memories of high school grades arises after the content has been forgotten by another mechanism. =A 50 year study of college grades= Many similar studies have been performed, such as a fifty- year study of remembering college grades. In this study one to 54 years after graduating, 276 alumni correctly recalled 3,025 of 3,967 college grades. The number of omission errors increased with the retention interval and better students made fewer errors. The accuracy of recall increased with confidence in recall. Eighty-one percent of errors of commission inflated the actual grade. These data suggested that distortions occur soon after graduation, remain constant during the retention interval, and are greater for better students and for courses students enjoyed most. Therefore, sometime in between when the memory is stored and when it is retrieved some time later, the distortion may arise. Methods for testing =Written scenario memory tests= Researchers have used written scenarios in which participants are asked to make a choice between two options. Later, on a memory test, participants are given a list of positive and negative features, some of which were in the scenario and some of which are new. A choice-supportive bias is seen when both correct and incorrect attributions tend to favor the chosen option, with positive features more likely to be attributed to the chosen option and negative features to the rejected option. *Deception: Henkel and Mather (2007) found that giving people false reminders about which option they chose in a previous experiment session led people to remember the option they were told they had chosen as being better than the other option. This reveals that choice-supportive biases arise in large part when remembering past choices, rather than being the result of biased processing at the time of the choice. =Deese/Roediger‚ÄìMcDermott paradigm= The Deese‚ÄìRoediger‚ÄìMcDermott paradigm (DRM) consists of a participant listening to an experimenter read lists of thematically related words (e.g. table, couch, lamp, desk); then after some period of time the experimenter will ask if a word was presented in the list. Participants often report that related but non-presented words (e.g. chair) were included in the encoding series, essentially suggesting that they 'heard' the experimenter say these non-presented words (or critical lures). Incorrect 'yes' responses to critical lures, often referred to as false memories, are remarkably high under standard DRM conditions. Relation to cognitive dissonance The theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance. Choice-supportive bias is potentially related to the aspect of cognitive dissonance explored by Jack Brehm (1956) as postdecisional dissonance. Within the context of cognitive dissonance, choice-supportive bias would be seen as reducing the conflict between \\"I prefer X\\" and \\"I have committed to Y\\".

It was located between Stroud Green station and Highgate station on Crouch End Hill just north of its junction with Hornsey Lane. The station building was located on the road bridge over the railway but only small parts remain of the structure today. History Crouch End station in 1920 The station was built by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway and opened on 22 August 1867. The line ran from Finsbury Park to Edgware via Highgate with branches to Alexandra Palace and High Barnet. After the 1921 Railways Act created the Big Four railway companies, the line was, from 1923, part of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER). In 1935 London Underground planned, as part of its \\"New Works Programme\\" to take over the line from LNER, modernise it for use with electric trains and amalgamate it with the Northern line. Works to modernise the track began in the late 1930s and were well advanced when they were interrupted and halted by the Second World War. Works were completed from Highgate to High Barnet and Mill Hill East and that section was incorporated into the Northern line between 1939 and 1941. Further works on the section between Finsbury Park, Highgate and Alexandra Palace were postponed and the line continued under the operation of the LNER. Because of wartime economies services were reduced to rush hours only, so that after the war the dwindling passenger numbers and a shortage of funds led to the cancellation of the unfinished works in 1950. British Railways (the successor to the LNER) closed the line temporarily from 29 October 1951 until 7 January 1952,. With dwindling passenger numbers the station was closed by British Railways after the last train on 3 July 1954 along with the rest of the line between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace. The line continued to be used for goods into the 1960s and by London Underground for train stock movements until 6 October 1970 when it was completely closed. Today the track has been removed and the station buildings have been demolished but the platforms remain in situ. The track bed between Muswell Hill and Finsbury Park is now the Parkland Walk.

Usually the term is used in reference to inmates or patients in a prison, hospital, psychiatric hospital or military base. People are placed on suicide watch when it is believed that they exhibit warning signs indicating that they may be at risk of committing bodily harm or fatal self-injury. Forms Various forms of suicide watch exist. These generally involve the subject's being under continuous or very frequent watch of a guard, such as a prison officer, security officer or orderly, who will intervene if the subject attempts to harm themselves. =Periodic= Periodic suicide watch, or more simply known as suicide watch, involves the subject being monitored through frequent periodic checks. =Intense= Intense suicide watch or observation involves the subject being observed continually by a person who may be employed in one of several possible capacities, sitting or standing in direct sight or arm's reach of the subject. This may be known as a 1 to 1. Conditions People under suicide watch are put into an environment where it would be difficult for them to hurt themselves. In many cases, any dangerous items will be removed from the area, such as sharp objects and some furniture, or they may be placed in a special padded cell, which has nothing outcropping from the walls (e.g., a clothes hook or door closing bracket) to provide a place for a ligature to be attached, and with only a drain-grill on the floor. They may be stripped of anything with which they might hurt themselves or use as a noose, including shoelaces, belts, neckties, bras, shoes, socks, suspenders and bed sheets. In extreme cases the inmate may be undressed entirely. In even more extreme cases, inmates may be placed in \\"therapeutic restraints\\", a four- or five-point restraint system. The inmate is placed on their back on a mattress. Their arms and legs are tied down and a belt is placed across the chest. In a five-point system the head is also restrained. An inmate is allowed a range of movement every two hours, when one limb is released and they are allowed to move it for a short period. They are then restrained again, proceeding to the next limb. This process is repeated until all areas restrained have been moved. This process usually continues in eight-hour shifts, and the inmate has a face-to-face encounter with a mental health professional at least once in each eight-hour interval. This cannot continue for more than 16 consecutive hours. The inmate is continually watched by staff during this time. In the most extreme cases of self-harm, only when all other avenues have not worked or are impracticable, \\"chemical restraint\\" drugs may be used to sedate the inmate. In order for a facility to administer a chemical restraint, it must have the approval/recommendation of a licensed mental health professional, the facility warden, and a court order. Controversies Inmates are often placed naked in suicide cells, which are usually bare concrete, often without bedding (to prevent hanging by using bedsheets), and under frequent or continuous observation by guards. Unsanitary conditions are also common since toilet paper, underwear and tampons (all potential means of choking) are restricted. Being exposed without any way of covering oneself, coupled with being under constant observation, can aggravate mental distress, particularly if the inmate has been a victim of sexual abuse. These harsh conditions came to light in 1998 when Elizabeth B., an inmate of Framingham prison in Massachusetts, USA, called a radio talk show to describe how she had been treated while on suicide watch: > I was ... put on eyeball status, stripped of belongings, clothing, placed > naked in a room with nothing but a plastic mattress on the floor. Watched 24 > hours a day by a man or woman. I was on my period but because of my status > not allowed to have tampons or underwear. I was very humiliated, degraded. > Being on eyeball status with male officers, my depression intensified. I > didn't want to be violated any more than I already was, so I put the > mattress up against the window. When I did that I was in violation because > they couldn't see me. The door was forced open, I was physically restrained > in four-point restraints - arms, legs spreadeagled, tied to the floor, > naked, helmet on head, men and women in the room. Being on a suicide watch does not guarantee a person will not kill oneself. Ashley Smith, a female inmate at a facility in Canada, killed herself while under suicide watch in October 2007. The circumstances surrounding her death were the subject of the Ashley Smith inquest.

Tadeusz Brzozowski, S.J. (October 21, 1749 ‚Äì February 5, 1820) was a Polish scholar, teacher, administrator and a Jesuit priest. Having secured its continuity during the suppression of the Society until its restoration, he was elected twentieth Superior General of the Society of Jesus and was its first world-wide general. Background Brzozowski was born in K√∂nigsberg, Kingdom of Prussia, on October 21, 1749, into a Polish family. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1765, and studied Rhetoric, Greek, French and classical literature in Slutsk (Belarus) (1767‚Äì70), followed by Philosophy and Mathematics in Nie≈õwie≈º (1770‚Äì73). After the Suppression of the Order in the rest of the world on 21 July 1773 (owing to Catherine the Great, patron of \\"her\\" Jesuits, it did not apply in the Russian Empire), he continued his theological studies in Vilnius, where he was ordained priest in 1775. In effect he was no longer formally a member of the Society. Reprint: Zak≈Çad Narodowy im. Ossoli≈Ñskich, Krak√≥w 1989, However, as the partitions of Poland-Lithuania progressed over the next 20 years, paradoxically the range of the Jesuits expanded temporarily along with the borders of the Russian Empire. = Return to the Society in Russia = In 1782 Brzozowski left for Polotsk, Belarus in the Russian Empire, in order to be able to rejoin the Society, which was allowed to continue there. A gifted linguist (fluent in Latin, French, German, Russian) he translated theological works into his native Polish, such as, Dykcjonarz filozoficzny religii (a Philosophical Dictionary of Religion) by C. F. Nonnotte, Wilno 1782 and O na≈õladowaniu Naj≈õwiƒôtszej Maryi Panny (The Imitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary) by A. de Rouville, Po≈Çock 1800. He was also a successful and well known preacher. In 1797 he was named Secretary of the Society and worked closely with Gabriel Lenkiewicz, Franciszek Kareu and Gabriel Gruber, the successive Vicars General of the Society in Russia. On their behalf he corresponded with the many ex-jesuits abroad who wished to rejoin the Society. At the Regional Congregation of 1802 he was made Assistant of the newly elected Superior of the Jesuits of the Russian Province, Gabriel Gruber. He had an especial devotion to the Jesuit martyr, Andrew Bobola and in 1808 he exhumed his remains from Pinsk and brought them for reburial in Polotsk. He expanded missionary activity in Mozdok, in the Caucasus (1806), Irkutsk (1810) and in Tomsk (1814). He also planned to send missionaries to China. In 1806-1810 he despatched eight Belorussian Jesuits to Boston to help foster the Society's revival there. = Superior General = Following the death of Gruber, in 1805, the Regional (Polish) Fourth Congregation met at Polotsk, again part of Lithuania and elected Tadeusz Brzozowski as Superior General of the Society which was still functioning in the territory of Russia. The newly elected General immediately sent a message to Pope Pius VII thanking him for having restored the Society in Sicily. By then a steady stream of young men was coming to Russia to join the Society. Between 1803 and 1805, 103 candidates entered the novitiate of Polotsk, 23 of them already ordained priests. The total number of Jesuits grew to 333, mostly engaged in educational activities, in 7 high schools in Russia, but also moving into pastoral work in Latvia and Lithuania. It became clear that the suppression of the Society would eventually be lifted. in 1812 the college in Polotsk was upgraded by Alexander I of Russia into a university academy, thus allowing affiliation of all the Jesuit schools and affording them protection from undue local political interference. In October 1806, the \\"ex-Jesuits\\" of Maryland in America were fully incorporated into the Society and Brzozowski allowed an American novitiate to be opened with ten novices at Georgetown. Later that year, Bishop Joseph-Octave Plessis of Qu√©bec wrote to exiled Pope Pius VII and to Brzozowski, begging for Jesuits to be sent from Great Britain both to Halifax Nova Scotia and also to work among the aboriginal people in Upper Canada. Brzozowski sent four men as requested, two from Russia and two from England, but the Napoleonic Wars in Europe and the dangers of travel made their mission impossible. Internal tensions grew in the Society as non-Russian or Polish Jesuits, not being conversant with the political situation of the Russian empire, criticized Brzozowski for certain decisions he took which, in their estimation, were too liberal, such as allowing the Orthodox faith to be taught in Jesuit schools. = Restoration of the Society = Brzozowski worked tirelessly to obtain the general restoration of the Society, both personally and through his delegate in Rome, Father Luigi Fortis SJ. On his return from Napoleonic exile to Rome, Pope Pius VII lifted the suppression of the Society on August 7, 1814. Forty-one years after Clement XIV suppressed the Society, Pius VII celebrated mass in the Church of the Ges√∫, and formally promulgated the Papal bull of restoration, Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum. The newly reconstituted Society of Jesus deemed a general congregation unnecessary: Brzozowski retained his role and became formally Superior General of the Society of Jesus. However, Tsar Alexander prohibited Brzozowski from leaving Russi. Brzozowski therefore appointed Luigi Fortis, as his representative in Rome from 1814 until his death in 1820. Brzozowski had managed to secure the continuity of the Society from his exile in Russia. = Political complications = The Society's restoration coincided with Russia becoming more nationalistic and strengthening its native Orthodox Church. The Jesuits were seen as an obstacle to those developments. Opposed to the expansion and influence of the Society, Alexander published an edict on December 20, 1815, expelling the Jesuits from Saint Petersburg and taking over their high school on the grounds that they were converting Russian nobles to Catholicism. Despite his ailing health and protests, Brzozowski was detained and forbidden to return to Rome. Sensing that the days of the Society in Russia were numbered, Brzozowski sent several Jesuits to Western Europe to speed up the reestablishment of the order. Death Brzozowski died on February 5, 1820 and was buried in Polotsk. He had taken the precaution to nominate an Italian, Mariano Petrucci, as his Vicar General, to ensure that the Congregation to elect his successor would meet in Rome. On 13 March 1820 the Society of Jesus was expelled from the Russian Empire. References Bibliography * Worcester SJ, T. (Ed.), (2017).

The capital, Laikom, is the seat of the ruler, the Fon, and his advisors, the Quifon, who continue to be the most respected leaders despite the imposition of a central Cameroonian government. Vincent Yuh II died in November 2017, Fon Ndzi II is the current Fon of Kom. The Cameroonian government recognizes to some degree the authority of the Fons and local chiefs subject to them. Kom includes most of Boyo division, including such towns as Fundong, Belo, Njinikom and Mbingo. The area can be reached from Bamenda on the so-called Ring Road. The elaborate language and rich culture of Kom are very similar to neighbouring groups, collectively known as the Tikar. The Kom language is also called Kom or Itangikom History During the 19th century migration in Cameroon, most tribes moved south in search of better economic opportunities. The Kom people, who originated from upper Mbam in Tikari, moved in search of fertile soils. They first settled in Babessi. While in Babessi, their population began to grow drastically, and rapidly. The Fon of Babessi feared a possible attack from the Kom people. He then tricked the Fon of kom (Njinabo I) into believing that the increase in their male population may some day lead to them being overthrown. The fon of Kom believed this and subsequently accepted his proposal to burn all the healthy men in two separate rooms. After the act was committed, the Fon of Kom realized that he had been tricked. The Babessi Fon had built a secret door for his men to escape when the fire started. Unable to bear the loss and betrayal, the Fon of Kom committed suicide by hanging himself. He died without a son. Legend has it that a python appeared and led the people of Kom to their present settlement in Laikom. For more information on Kom see Nkwi(2012 and 2015) Government and politics The Kom tribe covers ¬æ of the Boyo division. The capital of Kom is Laikom, and it is made up of over 43 villages. The tribe is ruled by a king or Fon (Fondom) and followed by the traditional parliament/legislative assembly ( kwifoyn).In Kom as elsewhere in the Bamenda Grassfields, it is the executive arm of the traditional government. Its job is to make sure that the Fon's orders are followed to the letter. Besides the traditional prime minister is the counsel of elders (nchidoh). Unlike any other elderly person in the Kom tribe, this set of people can easily be recognized by the red feather they carry on their hats. After the nchidoh, is the village head. He is somehow also the spiritual leader of the villages. He takes orders from the Kwifoyn and implements them. Economics Agriculture and trade is the predominant thing done in Kom in other to earn a living. In the field of agriculture, the people produce food crops like, sweet and Irish potato, beans, corn, coco yams. Coffee is the only cash crop produced in Kom. In trade, there are many cooperative unions that help in the marketing of coffee. Many Kom retailers buy stuff from places like Nigeria, Bamenda and Baffoussam. Some buy right from Dubai; to retail in the main towns of Fundong, Njinikom and Belo. Society, culture, customs Kom society is patriarchal. Males hold the vast majority of power and privilege, while females labour mostly in domestic roles in kitchens and on farms. A man's power and wealth is measured by the number of his wives. Polygamy is a thing of pride. This makes a man with one wife voiceless in a men's gathering. Girls get married as young as 15 years old. Food at traditional wedding Although Kom males hold most of the power in day-to-day affairs, Kom society is matrilineal in matters of succession. In this way, Kom society differs significantly from other tribes of Cameroon. Lineage in the Kom culture continues on the side of the mother and not the father in such a way that when an adult Kom male dies, ownership of his property including his compound, wives and children is transferred to his nephew (son of his sister) and not his own son. The process of matrilineal succession in Kom society is more complex if a deceased male did not have a nephew to inherit his property. In this case, succession is continued on the side of first cousin. As of the late 20th century, this practice is growing obsolete. Kom society also places a great emphasis on respect for elders. There are numerous dance groups like the Njang and chong, which performs in many occasions including funerals. Prince Yerima Afo‚Äôo kom and Ateh Bazor are two of Kom's most prominent folklore musicians.

A failed treaty attempt between the United States and the Creek Indians at Rock Landing, Georgia, in 1789, was abruptly ended by Creek leader Alexander McGillivray. He described his grievances in a letter to the United States commissioners. Washington sent a special emissary, Colonel Marinus Willett, to McGillvray, persuading him to come to New York City, then the capital of the United States, to conduct a treaty with Washington and Henry Knox directly. In the summer of 1790, twenty-seven Creek leaders led by Alexander McGillivray traveled to New York and signed a treaty on behalf of the \\"Upper, Middle, and Lower Creek and Seminole composing the Creek nation of Indians\\". Informed of European legal customs by his Scottish father, McGillivray provided his formal signature on behalf of the Creek delegation. Creek leaders ceded a significant portion of their hunting grounds, including land stretching to the Oconee River, to the United States and agreed to turn runaway slaves over to federal authorities, although the Creek leaders averred that convincing the Creek people to honor the new boundary lines or return African-American slaves would be difficult at best. The United States granted the Creeks the right to punish non-Indian trespassers in their territory but refused to allow the Creeks to punish non- Indians who committed crimes on Creek lands. For their part, the Creeks agreed to turn over Creek people accused of crimes to the U.S. courts. In a secret side agreement to the treaty, McGillivray received a commission as a brigadier in the U.S. Army, with an annual salary of $1,500. The treaty also provided the tribes with agricultural supplies and tools. McGillivray was granted permission to import goods through the Spanish port of Pensacola without paying American duties.

It was incorporated in 1845 and absorbed into the Great Southern Railways in 1924. At its peak the MGWR had a network of , making it Ireland's third largest network after the Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&WR;) and the Great Northern Railway of Ireland. The MGWR served part of Leinster, County Cavan in Ulster and much of Connacht. Its network was entirely within what in 1922 became the Irish Free State. Early development The Midland Great Western Railway Act received the Royal Assent in July 1845, authorising it to raise ¬£1,000,000 capital and to build a railway from Dublin to and and to buy the Royal Canal. Construction of the main line began from Dublin in January 1846 and proceeded westwards in stages, supervised by chief engineer G. W. Hemans. It opened from as far as Enfield in May 1847, to in December 1847 and to Mullingar in October 1848. =Dublin to Galway= Rivalry existed between the MGWR and the GS&WR;, each of which wanted to build the line to . The MGWR extended its line from Mullingar and the GS&WR; from its line at . The MGWR was first, going via and reaching Galway, from Dublin, in August 1851. It was not until 1859 that the GS&WR; got as far as Athlone. The GS&WR; was obliged to operate its service over MGWR track between Athlone and Galway, paying the MGWR 65% of passenger and 55% of goods receipts. The GS&WR; retained a separate station, which is now the sole operating station, as the last service to the MGWR station ran on 13 January 1985.. The branch is to be made into a rail trail as part of the Dublin-Galway Greenway by 2020. =Galway to Clifden= In 1890 the Government granted the MGWR ¬£264,000 to build a railway to Clifden on the Atlantic coast of County Galway. It opened as far as Oughterard in January 1895 and to Clifden in July 1895. Due to its inland route it did not serve the bulk of the area's population, so the GSR closed it in 1935. A similar branch line was built at the same time from Westport to Achill on the Atlantic coast of County Mayo. The MGW built the first section, opening it as far as Newport in February 1894 and Mulranny in May 1894. The Board of Works built the section from Mulranny to Achill, which opened in May 1895. The GSR closed the line in 1937. =Branch lines= Newport on the Westport to Achill branch line. At its peak the MGWR had a number of branch lines: * to (opened as the Dublin and Meath Railway 1862, leased to the MGWR 1869, sold to the MGWR 1888) * extension from Navan to , (opened by the Navan and Kingscourt Railway 1865, sold to the MGWR 1888) * Kilmessan Junction to Athboy (opened 1864, closed 1963) * Nesbitt Junction (near Enfield) to Edenderry (opened 1877, closed 1963) * Streamstown to Clara, County Offaly (opened 1863, closed 1963) * Attymon Junction to Loughrea (light railway worked by the MGWR, opened 1890) * Galway to Clifden (opened 1895, closed 1935) * Westport to Achill (opened 1895, closed 1937) * Inny Junction to Cavan Town (opened 1856, closed 1960) * Kilfree Junction railway station to Ballaghaderreen (opened by the Sligo and Ballaghaderreen Railway 1874, sold to the MGWR 1877, closed 1963) * Crossdoney to Killeshandra (opened 1886, closed 1960) * Athlone to Westport (opened by the Great Northern and Western Railway 1860‚Äì66, leased to the MGWR 1870, sold to the MGWR 1890) * Claremorris to Ballinrobe (light railway worked by the MGWR, opened 1892, closed 1960) * Manulla to Ballina, County Mayo (opened 1873) * extension from Ballina to Killala (opened 1893, closed 1937) Consolidation In 1924 the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State passed the Railways Act, which that November merged the MGWR with the Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&WR;), Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway to form the Great Southern Railway. In January 1925, that was joined by the Dublin and South Eastern Railway to form the Great Southern Railways. In 1907 in a MGWR bus. Locomotives and rolling stock Locomotives and rolling stock were maintained at MGWR's Broadstone works in Dublin. =Livery= The MGWR painted all of its locomotives bright emerald until about 1902, when the first of the new Class A 4-4-0 express locomotives were outshopped in royal blue. This did not wear well and in 1905 the company adopted grass green. From about 1913 locos were painted gloss black until the MGWR became part of the GSR in 1925. From then on, all locomotives were gradually repainted plain unlined dark grey. Passenger coaches were finished in varnish or brown paint until the blue livery was introduced in 1901. As on the locomotives this weathered badly and from 1905 the MGWR reverted to brown, which after 1910 was not so well-adorned with lining. From October 1918 coaches were painted a very dark Crimson and after 1924 the GSR used a similar shade for some years. =Preservation= MGWR Dargan Saloon at Cultra No MGWR locomotive has been preserved but several of its six-wheeled carriages exist. * No. 25 - Downpatrick and County Down Railway.

The \\"Spanish Road\\" was a military supply/trade route used from 1567‚Äì1633, which stretched from Northern Italy to the Low Countries. It crossed through relatively neutral territory, and was therefore Europe's most preferred military route. In the days of its use it was known in French as \\"le chemin des Espagnols\\". Soldiers were able to march the from Milan to Flanders an average of a day. Sea transport was much faster, able to cover about a day, but was highly exposed to storms and enemy attacks. For large groups, overland communication was more reliable, allowing the Spanish to send over 123,000 men compared to only 17,600 by sea, between 1567 and 1633.  Background  The conflict between Philip II of Spain and the Dutch rebels in the Spanish-ruled Habsburg Netherlands, culminating in the Eighty Years' War, symbolised the prominent European power struggle of the 16th century between Catholics and Protestants.Jonathan I. Israel, The Dutch Republic and the Hispanic World, 1606‚Äì1661 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 1‚Äì11. In 1550, the wars had stretched Spain's finances thin.Herman Van der Wee, The Low Countries in the Early Modern World, trans. Elizabeth Fackelman (Great Britain: Ashgate Publishing Limited, 1993), 26. 1566 was known as the \\"Year of Hunger\\" or \\"Year of Wonders\\". When social, political and religious unrest culminated in the Compromise of Nobles and the Beeldenstorm, apparently endangering the government of Philip's Regent in Brussels, Margaret of Parma, Spanish troops under the Duke of Alba were dispatched to restore order and punish the perceived insurrectionists.Herbert H. Rowen, ed. The Low Countries in Early Modern Times (New York: Harper and Row, Publishers, Inc., 1972), xviii. Those troops could at the time not be transported by sea and Philip was therefore forced to find a route to move troops from his garrisons in the Spanish Duchy of Milan overland to his Netherlands domains, crossing neutral territory.Parker, pp. 48‚Äì51 The Spanish Road was surveyed and mapped out in 1566, and Alba used it in July 1567.William Gaunt, Flemish Cities: Their History and Art (Great Britain: William Gaunt and Paul Elek Productions Limited, 1969), 103; Parker, pp. 51‚Äì57.  Establishment  To get to the Netherlands, the armies and travellers of the 16th century had to overcome many obstacles including extremely high mountain passes, large rivers, deep forests, and roadways filled with criminals. Therefore, it was necessary to find a route that would go around these barriers, for safer and easier travel, and the Spanish Road proved to be the answer. Parts of the road were already in use but it was Philip II, who in 1565, brought it together when he decided to link his territories through a route that travelled through them and neutral territory. Merchants came regularly to use parts of the road between France and Italy to trade goods with neighbouring countries. The main territories it linked were Franche-Comt√©, Luxembourg, and the territories of allies, Lorraine and Savoy. The layout of the Spanish Road was a large improvement over the previous system of moving troops through neutral territory. Maps used for Spanish expeditions had only the information that pertained directly to the military, excluding any other details. However, this forced the armies to use guides and scouts when they crossed unfamiliar terrain, since their extremely generalised maps could not guide them. Travellers on the road covered an average of a day, although in 1577 Spanish veterans left the Netherlands and marched a day because of the heat and in 1578, they made the trip at the rate of a day during the cold month of February.  Use  For military purposes, the Spanish Road was first used by the Duke of Alba in 1567, and the last army passed through it in 1620. It was not only utilised by troops, but also traders, and both were in need of food and shelter to complete their journeys. Shelter was rarely given to those who travelled on the road, especially soldiers. Officers would sometimes be able to stay in a nearby town, but their armies had to sleep under bushes or flimsy huts that they would make themselves. Residents of towns along the \\"road\\" were rightfully fearful of the armies that passed through because they would often find themselves victims of a robbery if they offered up their generosity. In 1580, the officers of the passing Spanish tercios occupied a house in Franche- Comt√© that had no furniture and temporary crockery that was guarded, because the providers were scared their possessions would be vandalised, burned or stolen. The Spanish Road was only used once or twice per year by the military, and the rest of the time by merchants. Because of this, military magazines were seen as unimportant by some countries. The military did, however, use a system of providing stages called etap√©s. This system was going to be put into place after the successful proposal of Don Crist√≥bal de Benavente to the Council of War in Madrid. Unfortunately, the Spanish King was not impressed, so Madrid did not support them. However, some \\"governors\\" did think the etap√©s were a good idea, so they set them up along the Spanish Road, using commissioners sent by the governor of the Spanish Netherlands or by the governor of the Milan to work out pricing details, so that the providers were always paid for their services. The first type of etap√©s was permanent and found only in Savoy. It consisted of a place where soldiers and other travellers had access to food and shelter when they passed through. The second type was in Franche-Comt√©, Lorraine and the Low Countries, and was created only when arranged for in advance by a private contractor, who would work out the payments, shipments and quantities of food based on the type and schedule of each individual military excursion. This system made the use of the Spanish Road more practical.  Effects  Along with the Spanish Road's military function it also became an important commercial route. The road also helped the Spanish establish permanent diplomatic contacts along its route, such as permanent embassies in Savoy and the Swiss Cantons that were supervised from Lombardy. When the French Wars of Religion broke out, the Spanish and others used the route to provide personnel and materiel support to French Catholics in their fight against the Protestant claimant to the French throne, Henry of Navarre. One unintended effect of the route was the circulation of the plague by soldiers and commercial travellers to areas along its length.  Fall  The Treaty of Lyon (January 17, 1601) forced the Spanish Road to be reduced to a narrow valley and a bridge over the Rh√¥ne. This loss of territory made Spanish passage on the road dependent on the approval of France, which refused passage to Ambrosio Spinola (1601‚Äì1602) claiming that Spinola's troops were part of the conspiracy of Charles de Gontaut, Duc de Biron. In 1609, Savoy expelled Spanish garrisons, followed by an alliance with France against Spain in 1610 and a dynastic war over possession of Montferrat (1613‚Äì1617), settled by the Peace of Asti. Savoy allowed a Spanish-Italian army to pass through the Spanish Road in 1620 but its anti-Spanish Treaty in 1622 ended Spanish travel on the Spanish Road forever.

Early years Former residence of He Yingqin in Nanjing. A native of Guizhou, He was healthy and bookish in his childhood. In 1907, he was enrolled in the Guiyang Military Elementary School, and transferred to the more famous Wuchang Third Army Middle School in the following year. In the same year, He was chosen by the Defense Department of Qing Dynasty to study in Japan in the 11th class of Tokyo Shimbu Gakko; a military preparatory academy. When studying in Japan, he became acquainted with fellow student Chiang Kai-shek. He learned military skills and was influenced by the anti-Qing Dynasty theories of the Tongmenghui, which he soon joined. In 1911 after the outbreak of Wuchang Uprising, He came back to China with other members of Tongmenghui to work for Chen Qimei, who was governor of Shanghai, and also known as Chiang's mentor. When the war waged by the Tongmenghui against Yuan Shikai failed, he was forced to take refuge in Japan. After, he continued his military training at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. His classmate at the time included Zhu Shaoliang. After his graduation in 1916, Liu Xianshi, the governor of Guizhou, planned to set up a military academy in Guizhou to train troops for himself. Liu asked his son, who also had studied in Japan, to enroll some talented individuals for this job. With the recommendation of Liu's son and Wang Wenhua, the commander of the Guizhou Army, He Yingqin was appointed as colonel of 4th Regiment of Guizhou Army. He won Wang's trust quickly and later, even married Wang's sister. In the power struggle between Liu and Wang, He supported Wang, consequently Liu lost power in 1920. As a reward, He was appointed as president of academy, head of police, and brigadier of the 5th Brigade of Guizhou Army. When Wang was assassinated by his rivals in 1921, the troops of Wang fell into chaos and civil strife. He was expelled from Guizhou by other generals and went to Yunnan to work for a local warlord. Rise and fall in the Kuomintang He Yingqin thanked for the cinematographer during Northern Expedition In 1924, Chiang Kai-shek made preparation for the establishment of Whampoa Military Academy under the authorization of Sun Yat-sen. Chiang knew of his alleged military talent and recommended that Sun appoint him as General Instructor of the academy. Sun sent a telegraph to Guangzhou asking if he would personally to accept the offer. In the course of the academy's establishment, He supported Chiang and won Chiang's appreciation. In the war against the local warlord Chen Jiongming, students training in the academy were grouped into two regiments, with He as a colonel of one of the regiments. In the war, he proved his courage and military talent by winning several battles although he had just recovered from an illness, and his performance made a deep impression on both Chiang and the Soviet Union's military advisor Vasily Blyukher (General Galen). Galen sent his sword to He as a gift after this war. In July of the same year, the National Revolutionary Army was established. The students of the Whampoa Military Academy were grouped into the 1st Army Corps, with Chiang as the supreme commander, and He Yingqin as commander of one division, with Zhou Enlai as the party representative of He's division. In September, Chen Jiongming masterminded another commotion. Chiang led the war to put down this revolt, in which He demonstrated his military talent again. During the Northern Expedition in 1926, He Yingqin succeeded Chiang as commander of the 1st Army Corps and led his army marching into Guangdong and Fujian provinces. After He controlled the whole area of Fujian, he conquered Zhejiang as well. When Chiang began to confront the Communists He continued to support Chiang. In 1927 He supported the Shanghai massacre of 1927 in which General Bai Chongxi‚Äôs Eastern Route Army launched a massacre on Communist Party members in Shanghai, ending first KMT-CCP alliance. When Chiang seized power, the tension arose with Wang Jingwei and the New Guangxi Clique led by Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, who made public statements that Chiang should resign. Under these circumstances, He thought Chiang had made himself a public enemy and was destined to fail, so he lent secret support to Chiang's opponents. In the meeting to decide Chiang's future, when Bai asked Chiang to resign, Chiang turned to He for support, but He remained silent. Chiang was forced to resign. However, as Wang and his allies soon proved incompetent in controlling the situation, Chiang soon regained power. One of his first actions was to relieve He of his military command. He went to Hangzhou in protest, and during a meeting with Chiang, Chiang told He, \\"Without you, I can still take power, but without me, you will be nothing.\\" After careful consideration, He had to reconcile with Chiang. He was appointed chief of staff and training supervisor of the National Revolutionary Army. During his term, he spared no effort to train armies for Chiang and crack down on warlords by regrouping their armies into Chiang's own armies. During the war between Chiang and alliance of the New Guangxi Clique, Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, He commanded the army even after receiving word that his father had died, impressing Chiang with his dedication. During this time, he began to attend Catholic mass at his wife's urging and eventually embraced his wife's faith. This conversion came perhaps as a result of his despondency over his break with Chiang and loss of his position as army commander. Later in life, he would play a more active role as a Christian, becoming known as China's most prominent lay Catholic and a prominent supporter of the Moral Re-Armament movement.General He Yingqin: The Rise and Fall of Nationalist China left In 1930, He was appointed as Minister of Military Administration Department of the Nationalist (KMT) government, a post which he held for over a decade. During his term, he made great contributions to military service, logistics, defense construction of KMT, and his probity and cleanness won him prestige and enhanced his reputation. In 1931, He was appointed as commander to lead Second Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet, but his troops suffered great losses, which was the beginning of the end of his reputation as a skillful commander. In the same year, the September 18 Incident provided for the Japanese a pretext of invading China. Chiang regarded the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as his archrival and placed priority on the suppression of CCP forces, rather than the Japanese. Chiang thus ordered He to Northern China to negotiate compromises with the Japanese, as he was known to be on friendly terms with some of their leaders. In 1933, Japanese armies invaded Rehe and broke through the KMT defense along the Great Wall. He Yingqin replaced Zhang Xueliang as chairman of the Beijing Military Committee, which was the supreme organ in charge of the military forces of Northern China. He advocated no direct confrontation with the Japanese troops, and signed the Tanggu Cease-Fire Accord with General Yasuji Okamura, who was deputy chief of staff of Kantogun at that time. After that, in an effort to prevent further conflict with Japan, He Yingqin opposed military action against the Japanese, and disarmed Feng Yuxiang's anti-Japanese army. However, when the Blue Shirts Society (BSS), the secret organization of the Whampoa Clique of the KMT, and a firm anti-Japanese group fought back with assassination and other violent activities in 1935, the Japanese argued that it was violation of the Tanggu Truce. Japanese General Yoshijir≈ç Umezu, who was commander of Japanese troops in Northern China at that time provided He with proof of the BSS activities which had been gathered by the Japanese spy-master Kenji Doihara, and He was forced to sign the He- Umezu Agreement which required that all forces having relations with the BSS inclusive of military police, including KMT regular forces such as 2nd Division and 25th Division be evacuated from Beijing and out of Hebei province. With both KMT regular and BSS irregular forces out of Northern China, He Yingqin had little room for maneuver with the Japanese. He returned to Nanjing to resume his job as minister. In December 1936, during the Xi'an Incident, Chiang was taken into custody by Zhang Xueliang's army. There were disagreements among the KMT leaders on how to handle this situation. Chiang's wife Soong Mei-ling was afraid of Chiang being killed and urged peace negotiations. However, He strongly supported the need to solve this incident by force and was voted as acting commander to lead the KMT armies to the rescue of Chiang with the support of young and extremist officers of the BSS. He also contacted Wang Jingwei and asked him back to China to take charge of the KMT, and sent two armies marching to Xi'an to fight against Zhang's army. Soong went to Xi'an in person for peace talks and succeeded in rescuing Chiang. When Chiang came back, he distrusted He again. Nonetheless, He kept his position as minister but with little real power. With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, He Yingqin was appointed as chief of staff and worked with Chiang for drafting military plans. In 1944, when his title of Minister of War was taken over by Chiang's favorite, Chen Cheng, He was appointed as General Commander of the Chinese Military Area, which was an honorable title instead of real power, and was sent to Yunnan to train the Chinese Expeditionary Army, which was set up under the proposal of Joseph Stilwell, for assisting in Allied operations in Southeast Asia. Commander-in-chief of the China Expeditionary Army Yasuji Okamura presenting the Japanese Instrument of Surrender to He Yingqin in Nanjing on 9 September 1945. With the defeat of Japan in August 1945, He was appointed as representative of both the Chinese Government and the Southeast Asia Allied Forces at the September 9th ceremony in Nanjing to accept the statement of surrender submitted by General Yasuji Okamura, who was Commander of Japanese troops in China at that time. host the surrender of Japanese troops in China. This historic moment put He under the spotlight of the world, and was the peak of his career. In 1946, the KMT government set up the Defense Department to take charge of military operations against CCP forces in the Chinese Civil War, but He lost to Chen Cheng and Bai, who were appointed as Chief of Staff and Defense Minister respectively. He was sent instead to the United Nations Security Council as director of the Chinese military delegation. One year later, He was called back to be a senior military advisor, and regained the position of Defense Minister in 1948, in time to witness the collapse of KMT power. In 1949, Chiang had to resign for the third time, when Li Zongren was voted as acting president. In order to contain Li's power and influence, Chiang asked He to take the job of Speaker and later the head of the Executive Yuan of Li's cabinet, and was also named as acting Defense Minister. He took the job and proposed the plan of cease-fire first and peace negotiations later, for KMT to win time for its governance in China. The Communists exploited the cease fire to cross the Yangtze River and capture Nanjing, the capital of KMT government. Although the KMT still had huge numbers of troops, they were poorly armed and equipped and thus no longer had the combat power to turn the tide, especially after the United States refused to supply any more military aid. In May, He resigned with his cabinet members in Guangzhou. Later years When He arrived in Taiwan, he said he would leave politics for introspection of the failure of the KMT. When Chiang was reelected as president of the Republic of China in 1950, He lost his election as member of the central committee of the KMT, and only gained the honorary title of senior advisor. He took charge of several clubs and associations working for the KMT, and spent most of his time playing sports, bridge, and planting. In 1986 He suffered from apoplexy and was sent to a hospital, where, after several months treatment, he died on October 21, 1987, at the age of 97. With the nickname of Lucky General, he survived battles and campaigns, and lived longer than most of the patriarchs of KMT inclusive of Chiang. His remains are interred at Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery in Taiwan. See also *New 6th Army References *Dupuy, Trevor N.

All light fixtures have a fixture body and one or more lamps. The lamps may be in sockets for easy replacement‚Äîor, in the case of some LED fixtures, hard- wired in place. Fixtures may also have a switch to control the light, either attached to the lamp body or attached to the power cable. Permanent light fixtures, such as dining room chandeliers, may have no switch on the fixture itself, but rely on a wall switch. Fixtures require an electrical connection to a power source, typically AC mains power, but some run on battery power for camping or emergency lights. Permanent lighting fixtures are directly wired. Movable lamps have a plug and cord that plugs into a wall socket. Light fixtures may also have other features, such as reflectors for directing the light, an aperture (with or without a lens), an outer shell or housing for lamp alignment and protection, an electrical ballast or power supply, and a shade to diffuse the light or direct it towards a workspace (e.g., a desk lamp). A wide variety of special light fixtures are created for use in the automotive lighting industry, aerospace, marine and medicine sectors. Portable light fixtures are often called lamps, as in table lamp or desk lamp. In technical terminology, the lamp is the light source, which, in casual terminology, is called the light bulb. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) recommends the term luminaire for technical use. History Fixture manufacturing began soon after production of the incandescent light bulb. When practical uses of fluorescent lighting were realized after 1924, the three leading companies to produce various fixtures were Lightolier, Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation, and Globe Lighting in the United States.\\"Early industry leaders\\", of fluorescent fixture manufacturing, Paul Levy (1998) Lampett, fyra stycken - Hallwylska museet - 106971.tifNeoclassical light fixture; mid-19th century; bronze; height: 18 cm; Hallwyl Museum (Stockholm, Sweden) Lamp and lampshade Tiffany.jpgLamp and lampshade made of Tiffany glass; circa 1890-1900; Budapest Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest, Hungary) Lamp MET DP239606.jpgLamp; 1902-1918; lead and glass; 67.9 x 52.1 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) \\"Daffodil\\" lamp MET DP-16377-003.jpg\\"Daffodil\\" lamp; 1904‚Äì1924; leaded opalescent glass and gilt bronze; height: 67.9 cm, diameter of shape: 51.4 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art Fixture types Light fixtures are classified by how the fixture is installed, the light function or lamp type. =Free-standing or portable= * Table lamp fixtures, standard lamp fixtures, and office task light luminaires. ** Balanced-arm lamp is a spot light with an adjustable arm such as anglepoise, RAMUN or Luxo L1. ** Gooseneck lamp ** Nightlight * Floor Lamp ** Torch lamp or torchi√®res are floor lamps with an upward-facing shade.

Shortly before its closure it employed several hundred people including engineers, scientists, psychologists and other technical staff spread over several locations including Melbourne, Sydney and Launceston (Tasmania). The closure of TRL, with retrenchment of about 90% of its staff, was part of a broader restructure of Telstra's Network and Technology group following the announcement in November 2005 of the outcome of a strategic review led by new CEO Sol Trujillo. The new operating model places more emphasis on the reliance on key vendor partners, rather than the traditional in-house expertise that TRL provided to assist Telstra in being an intelligent purchaser of equipment and systems. Telstra is Australia's dominant telecommunications carrier.  History  TRL was originally established as the Research Laboratories of the Postmaster-General's Department in 1923. The Research Laboratories continued as PMG became Telecom Australia and later became Telstra, and was responsible for the development of several key technologies. Notable achievements included a part in the development of radar for WW2, the first fax service in Australia, the first public TV broadcast in Australia, developed termite- resistant cabling, assisted with the development of the bionic ear and the cochlear ear implant, developed the optical fibre cold clamp, built the first system to route calls to a single number to destination depending on location (One3), and even demonstrated a working Internet fridge.

It is based on the Greek myth of Jason and the Argonauts. Plot The film opens as soldiers invade the city of Iolcus. King Aeson's brother Pelias is leading the charge. Inside the temple he goes to embrace his brother but produces a dagger and kills him during the embrace. This is witnessed by his wife Polymele and his son Jason. He intends to do the same to Jason but one of the guards rescues him and takes him out of the palace through a secret tunnel. It is then revealed that this is a memory, experienced as a nightmare by an older Jason, who awakes. He is then ordered by his uncle to retrieve the golden fleece. He recruits a crew from the simple folk of Iolcus, including shepherds and farmers. He is joined by Hercules, Orpheus, Atalanta and the brothers Castor and Pollux. Acastus stows away on the ship. The Argonauts run aground on a strange island in the middle of the ocean that is actually the sea god Poseidon. In the ensuing storm, they lose the map. The crew make their way to the Isle of Lemnos, an island of warrior women, to recover from the experience and repair the ship. The men pleasure themselves with the women while their ship is repaired (except Orpheus and Atalanta) and Jason sleeps with the queen Hypsipyle. Atalanta discovers that the women have killed all the men on the island and are planning to sacrifice the crew. She warns Jason, and the Argonauts flee the island. The crew become rebellious and Jason has Zetes, a young man with brilliant vision, see the stars and find their route to Tabletop Island, where they find Phineus. They are attacked by the Harpies - the winged monsters that torment Phineus - and kill them. In return, Phineus tells them the Golden Fleece is in Colchis. Meanwhile, on Colchis, the princess Medea has visions of the crew and her brother Aspyrtes goes out to find them. Jason finds the ship wrecked and rescues Aspyrtes. They approach the \\"Dark Rocks\\" and send a dove through before sailing through themselves. The ship docks at Colchis and Jason goes ashore with Aspyrtes, Castor and Pollux. Hera asks Eros to shoot Medea so she falls in love with Jason. King Aertes wants Jason killed but Medea convinces him to face the Bulls of Colchis (sometimes called the Menaian Bull). Medea gives Jason magic oil that protects Jason from the bull's fiery-breath. Jason yokes the bull and ploughs a field and sows it with dragon's teeth. Warriors sprout up from the earth, and Jason tricks them into attacking each other. Medea tells Jason she must go with the Fleece. Aspyrtes overhears this and sends soldiers out after them. The other Argonauts debate whether to leave or not. Hercules, Orpheus and Argos sail the ship around the island to make it seem as if they have left while the others hide in the water and then join Jason and Medea. When the soldiers attack, Medea kills her brother and leads them to the Fleece which is guarded by a dragon. Some Argonauts are killed before Jason sets a noose around the dragon's neck and makes it fall off a precipice. They take the Fleece and sail away from Colchis. Acastus has been wounded and Medea uses magic to heal him. Atalanta confesses she loves Jason but he says he will marry Medea. She has a vision of her father's death and the two kiss. Zeus attempts to seduce Medea but she says she loves Jason, even when he pulls out Eros's arrow. The ship arrives back in Iolcus and Jason learns his mother killed herself, believing him and Acastus to be dead. They rest in the bay and Acastus steals the Fleece and goes into town. Pelias kills him and takes the Fleece. Medea then goes and says he will marry her. Jason and the others sneak into the palace through the secret tunnel. Argos is killed by one of the guards. Pelias tries to kill Jason but is stabbed by his own knife. To cremate the dead Argos, his corpse is burned with the Argo. Then Jason marries Medea and they live as King and Queen of Iolcus.

Listed at 5'11 , 200 lb. , Berenguer batted and threw right- handed. He was born in Aguadulce, Cocl√©, Panama.SABR BioProject. Article written by Jason Lenard. Retrieved on February 10, 2016.Baseball Reference Statistics and History. Retrieved on February 10, 2016. A mean-looking, husky pitcher with long hair and a mustache, Berenguer was nicknamed 'Pancho Villa' by his teammates, and Twins fans admiringly referred to him as 'Se√±or Smoke' or 'El Gasolino' due to his mid-90s mph fastball. Extremely wild as a youngster, Berenguer learned to harness his sneaky fastball which he liked to throw inside, and added a deceptive forkball. His effectiveness was aided by his intimidating appearance and disposition. Berenguer was signed by the New York Mets as an amateur free agent in 1975. He made his MLB debut with the team in 1978. By April 1981, Berenguer had a 1-4 win-loss record and a 4.75 earned run average (ERA) in 16 career appearances with the team, and he was still having problems controlling his fastball, so the Mets traded him to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for outfielder Marvell Wynne and pitcher John Skinner. Berenguer later pitched for seven organizations before joining the Minnesota Twins. His breakout season came in 1987, when he posted an 8-1 record with a 3.94 ERA and four saves for the American League champion Twins, en route to the 1987 World Championship over the St. Louis Cardinals. During the 1987 playoffs, Juan recorded ‚ÄúThe Berenguer Boogie,‚Äù a music video that featured Juan dancing and singing in a trench coat and briefcase. Berenguer previously won a World Series ring with the 1984 Champion Detroit Tigers, though he did not play in the Series. Following his MLB career, Berenguer continued to play in the minors. After spending 1993 and part of 1994 in the Mexican League, he returned to Minnesota and pitched for the independent Minneapolis Loons and Southern Minny Stars in the Prairie League. He then signed to pitch for the Duluth‚ÄìSuperior Dukes of the Northern League prior to the 1998 season, but never played for them. In between, he played winter ball in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. After baseball, Berenguer returned to Minnesota, where he worked in marketing for a local television station. He also became a salesman for an automobile dealership in Bloomington, Minnesota.

The golden armor comes with a shield which can block one projectile before breaking. The last upgrade is a better shield which can block up to three projectiles before breaking and allow Arthur's firepower to charge up quicker. No matter how upgraded, his armor falls off following any touch by an enemy, leaving Arthur defenseless and clad only in his underwear, at which point he will die if hit again. Shields can only block projectiles if Arthur is standing still. Like in Ghouls n' Ghosts, hidden treasure chests can be found for weapons, armor upgrades, bonus points and sometimes unwanted traps such as bear traps and an evil magician who transforms Arthur. Treasure chests are hidden and can only be accessed by moving through specific areas of the screen, which causes them to appear. One key feature is the double jump, which allows Arthur to leap into the air, and then leap again. However, the player has no direct control of Arthur's movement once in the air. The second jump can change direction, but that is the only control players have. Sticking with tradition, players have to complete the game twice in a row, the second time with a special weapon (the Goddess's Bracelet, which only appears during the second playthrough), in order to confront the evil boss Sardius (resembling a huge demon in golden armor) and get the true ending. Plot The player takes the role of the knight Arthur, who must once again rescue the Princess from the demons. The antagonist this time is the Emperor Sardius (known as Samael in the Japanese version), who has kidnapped the Princess in order to obtain the whereabouts of the Goddess's Bracelet, the only weapon capable of destroying Sardius. After making it to Sardius's castle, Arthur must return to the beginning where the Princess hid the bracelet in order to destroy Sardius permanently. After repeating his journey, Arthur defeats Sardius with the bracelet and returns the Princess to the kingdom. Regional differences The crosses in the game were modified from the original Ch≈çmakaimura, where they resemble church crosses; in Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, they appear as ankhs. The final boss was also renamed from Samael to Sardius. The European version removed certain enemies and obstacles in the game, perhaps not only a measure to reduce the difficulty, but also to reduce potential slowdown. Ports A straight port of the Super NES version of Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts is featured alongside the arcade versions of Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts in the video game compilation Capcom Generation: Chronicles of Arthur for PlayStation, which was also released for the Sega Saturn in Japan as Capcom Generation 2. This PS version of the game is also included in Capcom Classics Collection for PlayStation 2 and Xbox and Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded for PlayStation Portable. The Game Boy Advance version, released simply as Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts in North America and Europe and as Ch≈çmakaimura R in Japan, features an \\"Arrange Mode\\" that enables the player to choose from redesigned levels and bosses based on the original Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts, depending on their success in keeping the bronze armor, or a higher difficulty tier of the standard levels set upon keeping the golden armor. Unlike the Normal Mode, in Arrange the Goddess' Bracelet is already accessible during the first playthrough. The SNES version of the game was released for the Virtual Console on the Wii on March 5, 2007, the Wii U on May 16, 2013, and New Nintendo 3DS on June 23, 2016. The GBA version was also released for the Wii U on October 22, 2015. Nintendo re-released Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts in the United States in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition. Reception As of June 30, 2017, the SNES version has sold 1.09 million units since its release in October 1991, making it Capcom's 75th best- selling game of all time. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly listed the SNES version as the 22nd best console video game of all time, calling it \\"One of the most graphically intense side-scrolling action games the Super NES has ever seen. Also one of the hardest.\\" Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.

The Catholic Church does not list this as an ecumenical council. The Annales Romani record the events thus: The council was called to resolve disorder over the papacy. A faction in the church encouraged Henry III to intervene, both to resolve the conflict and to receive his crown from the pope in an official ceremony. In the autumn of 1046 Henry III, already King of the Germans, crossed the Alps at the head of a large army and accompanied by a retinue of the secular and ecclesiastical princes of the empire, all of whom were his sworn vassals. Henry had two intentions, to be crowned Holy Roman emperor by the pope at Rome and, in order that the pontiff concerned have an unassailable title--one that would not cast doubts upon his conferred imperial title-- to establish order in the Duchy of Rome. Rome was in a state of warfare between noble factions, each of whom had a candidate they regarded as pope. A pope presided at St. Peter's, another at the Lateran and a third at Saint Mary Major. Two of them, Benedict IX, a scion of the counts of Tusculum, and Sylvester III of the Crescenzi clan, represented rival factions of the Roman nobility. The claim of the third, Gregory VI, was peculiar in that he had purchased the title in good faith from Benedict IX two years previously. The Catholic Encyclopedia asserts, \\"That this heroic measure for delivering the Holy See from destruction was simoniacal, has been doubted by many; but that it bore the outward aspect of simony and would be considered a flaw in Gregory's title, consequently in the imperial title Henry was seeking, was the opinion of that age.\\" (Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"Pope Clement II\\") Each claimant had a number of supporters in the Roman church and held a portion of the city. Henry was met by Gregory at Piacenza and was received with honor. It was decided that a synod should meet at Sutri, some 40 km north of Rome, well beyond the city's factional violence. Before the assembly Gregory testified that he had, \\"in all good faith and simplicity,\\" purchased the papacy from Pope Benedict IX in 1044. After the departure of Benedict, the Bishop of Sabina had also declared himself pope, as Sylvester III. In 1045 Benedict, not having received his pay-off, returned to Rome and renewed his claim to the papacy. The council summoned the three pontiffs, and both Sylvester and Gregory attended. The claims of all three popes were quickly dismissed. Sylvester was stripped of his sacerdotal rank and exiled to a monastery. Gregory resigned (his words were recorded as: \\"I, Gregory, bishop, servant of the servants of God, do hereby adjudge myself to be removed from the pontificate of the Holy Roman Church, because of the enormous error which by simoniacal impurity has crept into and vitiated my election.\\"), and the council ended on December 23. A form of the council was repeated in Rome the following day to oversee the dismissal of Benedict. The papacy was declared to be sede vacante. On December 24-25 Henry turned first to the powerful Adalbert, Archbishop of Bremen, who refused the dangerous honor. Henry's next choice for the papacy was his personal confessor, Suidger, Bishop of his recently created See of Bamberg. Suidger became the new pope, taking the title Clement II, but insisting on retaining the See of Bamberg, which was a source of financial support beyond the reach of Roman factions. He was immediately enthroned on Christmas Day. As his first pontifical act, Clement II placed the imperial crown upon his benefactor and the queen consort, Agnes, daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine. The new emperor received from the Romans and the pope the title and diadem of a Roman Patricius, a dignity with antecedents in the Late Empire, which since the tenth century had been assumed to confer the right to nominate the pontiff. Within a few decades the Gregorian Reforms would call this custom into question. Benedict would again renew his claim to the papacy in 1047, when Clement II died.

As of December 2018, Brayshaw has three nephews on AFL Lists at three clubs; Angus Brayshaw at the Melbourne Football Club. Andrew Brayshaw at the Fremantle Football Club and Hamish Brayshaw at the West Coast Eagles Football Club.http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/player-profile/hamish-brayshaw Mark Brayshaw is father of Angus, Andrew and Hamish.  Cricket career  Playing for South Australia and Western Australia, Brayshaw had a career spanning almost a decade. In that time he was a consistent fielder, with 43 catches. Not only is he a two-time Sheffield Shield winner, this achievement was completed with two states and occurred on the teams' respective home grounds. In the 1987/1988 final, Brayshaw won with Western Australia at the WACA Ground and in the 1995/1996 final he won with South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He would continue to play domestic cricket for one more season, before retiring at 30 years of age. Playing in the 1995/1996 Sheffield Shield final (South Australia v Western Australia) at the Adelaide Oval, Brayshaw performed solidly with the bat, scoring 87 (run out) in the first innings and 66 (caught and bowled off Brad Hogg) in the second innings.

West Australia fielded players including Michael Hussey, Justin Langer, Tom Moody, Damien Martyn, Adam Gilchrist, Jo Angel, Brad Hogg and Brendon Julian. While South Australia fielded players including Greg Blewett, Darren Lehmann, Tim Neilsen, Tim May and Jason Gillespie. The match ended in a draw, with a respectable performance from Adam Gilchrist 189 (not out) in the first innings,https://www.youtube.com/v/eYRlskFBOuU and as a consequence James and his South Australian teammates were the 1995/1996 Sheffield Shield premiers. Brayshaw also played in the 1987/1988 Sheffield Shield win for West Australia, but his performance with the bat was less successful.

Previously he has been part of the Melbourne-based show via his home studio in the Adelaide Hills. Brayshaw was installed as chairman of the North Melbourne Football Club on 6 December 2007 after the club rejected the AFL's deal to permanently relocate to the Gold Coast. In September 2007, Brayshaw announced that he was leaving The Cage to spend more time with his family ‚Äì just before the program was cancelled due to high costs and poor ratings. =Channel 9 years= Brayshaw also hosted The Sunday Footy Show, alongside panelists Dermott Brereton, Nathan Brown, Shane Crawford and Billy Brownless.

In an attempt to dilute shares and become too large for Men's Wearhouse to purchase, Jos. A. Bank agreed to acquire the men's outdoor clothing company Eddie Bauer for $825 million. Men's Wearhouse immediately responded by filing a lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition, which was expedited by Delaware Judge J. Travis Laster.‚Äù The lawsuit required Jos. A.

The prison is located in the south part of Erie County in the Town of Collins. It is adjacent to the Gowanda Correctional Facility, another medium-security prison. Both prisons are located north of the Village of Gowanda, at the southern end of Erie County.  History  In 1894, the Erie County Legislature passed an Act that gave rise to the Homeopathic State Hospital (later known as the \\"Gowanda Psychiatric Center,\\" prior to being much later-converted into correctional facilities) in Gowanda and Collins, New York.Historical sketch of the Village of Gowanda, N.Y. in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of its incorporation, August 8, 1898, Buffalo, NY: The Matthews-Northrup Company, Leonard, I.R., Reprinted 1998, Salem, MA: Higginson Book Company Land purchased for the State Hospital by Erie County included 500 acres and was known as the \\"Taylor tract.\\" When the State Care Act was effected in 1894, the land was transferred to the State of New York, which then conveyed it to the State Hospital. The correctional facility is situated along Taylor Hollow Road in Gowanda, with such road named for the farmer who owned the land that was purchased and used, originally, for the State Hospital. Approximately 50% of the residents are sex offenders, who are offered treatment. The grounds and buildings of both the Gowanda Correctional Facility and the Collins Correctional Facility, therefore, were formerly the Gowanda Psychiatric Center. In 1982, 40% of the original 500 acres of the Gowanda Psychiatric Center was utilized for the Collins Correctional Facility. The Gowanda Correctional Facility was built using the remaining acreage and opened its doors in 1994. The two prisons are separated by a road, and are administered independently. Collins Correctional Facility houses 1,700 inmates. Collins is unusual in that it contains two separate sections, with two mess halls, two medical facilities, two libraries, etc. They are separated by a road, with no secure passageway from one section to the other. Prisoners being transferred from one section to the other are manacled as with any trip outside prison walls. Transfers are frequent, several times a day. All inmate arrivals and departures take place from the north section. The prison also contains a security housing unit, also known as a SHU, for inmates who assault staff or other inmates and for those who disobey the prison rules.

It was founded by staff members of Toronto radio station CFNY-FM. From 1987 to 2015, the festival was held every year in the summer (except for 2007). The festival was most frequently held on Canada Day at Molson Park in Barrie, Ontario or a venue in Toronto. The festival featured predominantly Canadian rock bands. During its 29-year operation, the festival featured more than 300 performers. As of 2015, it was the longest running rock festival in Canada. History =Creation, early years (1987‚Äì1989)= The festival was created in 1987 by CFNY-FM staffers Scot Turner, Kneale Mann, Alan Cross, Earl Veale, and Phil Evans to celebrate the station‚Äôs tenth anniversary and the 120th Canada Day. A lineup, including Blue Rodeo, The Pursuit of Happiness, Teenage Head, and the first foreign act, The Saints, was soon arranged, but finding an appropriate location proved to be difficult. A farmer's field in Oakville, Ontario was considered, but would have involved complications with staging, electricity, bathrooms and parking. Other suggestions included Mosport International Raceway and Cayuga Speedway, but as they were unavailable, Molson Park in Barrie was chosen. Organizers worried that fans would not want to drive from Toronto to the relatively unknown location in Barrie (approximately 90 km [55 mi]), but after purchasing tickets through Pizza Pizza locations for just $1.02 per ticket, 25,000 people arrived for the inaugural Edgefest on July 1, 1987. Although the 1987 festival was supposed to be a one-off event, its success and positive feedback encouraged the organizers to do it again the next year. The 1988 edition was sold out, and brought over 32,000 people to Molson Park. Attendees paid $3 each for admission. The lineup featured mostly Canadian bands, including the first of many appearances by 54-40, and three foreign acts. In 1989, in spite of competing summer weekend activities and Highway 400 leading up to Molson Park being jammed both from both Cottage country and Toronto, the festival was once again sold out. That year's lineup included Sass Jordan, Sarah McLachlan and The Tragically Hip. =Transition period (1990‚Äì1992)= Between 1989 and the end of 1990, CFNY underwent a change in management, which brought with it a change in format. While the festival did go on that year, and once again sold out Molson Park, many people came in order to protest the new programming policies (in fact, someone even hired a plane to tow a protest banner over the park). However, the show went on glitch-free, and featured 54‚Äì40, The Tragically Hip, The Pursuit of Happiness, The Grapes of Wrath and The Skydiggers. By the fifth show, in 1991, the station owners had again been replaced, and the format of both show and station had stabilized. That year's lineup featured the Violent Femmes, who were the first foreign act to perform at the festival in two years. That year's lineup also featured Blue Rodeo and the Crash Test Dummies. For the 1992 edition, Molson had planned \\"The Great Canadian Party\\", a series of Molson-sponsored concerts, simultaneously running across Canada on Canada Day 1992. However, the two companies came to an agreement to share the show, with half the bands booked by the Edge (including 54‚Äì40, The Tragically Hip, and Leslie Spit Treeo) and the other half booked by Molson (including Sass Jordan, Amanda Marshall and Spinal Tap). =Ontario Place Forum (1993‚Äì1994)= In 1993, Molson needed the whole park for their own purposes, so the festival relocated to the Ontario Place Forum. 1993 was the first year the festival was officially called \\"Edgefest\\", a name that stuck with the festival for every year after. It was also the first year to have more than one day of concerts, taking place on July 1 and 2. Day 1 of the festival included The Odds, The Watchmen and Rheostatics. Day 2 featured the first Canadian performance by Radiohead. The 1994 edition of Edgefest also took place at the Ontario Place Forum and featured three international groups; The Proclaimers, Toad the Wet Sprocket, and The Lemonheads. This show was among the last events held at the Forum, which was torn down shortly after and replaced with the Molson Amphitheatre. =Molson Amphitheatre, return to Molson Park (1995‚Äì1996)= Once the new Molson Amphitheatre was built, Molson offered it to Edgefest for three dates in 1995. The first was on the May long weekend, May 21, 1995. About 9,000 people came to see Blur and Elastica, during the height of Britpop. It was also an early major appearance for Our Lady Peace, who recently had success in Canada with their hit singles \\"Starseed\\" and \\"Naveed\\". Ned's Atomic Dustbin also performed for the last time before breaking up. 20,000 people came for the annual Canada Day edition, which featured an all- Canadian lineup including The Odds, Treble Charger, The Watchmen, hHead, Junkhouse and Crash Vegas. The third Edgefest date of the year occurred on August 5 and had a smaller crowd. Most of the performers were Canadian, but a pre-fame Sugar Ray was also featured. This concert was billed as Sloan's farewell performance. (The band re-formed not long after.) The festival's tenth incarnation took place back at Molson Park on June 30, 1996. It was the first year in the festival's history that there wasn't a show held on Canada Day. The show was headlined by The Tea Party and sold out with 35,000 people attending the festival. =Cross-Canada tour (1997‚Äì1999)= In 1997, it was announced that Edgefest 1997 would be held across Canada on an eight-city tour, with four dates being held in Eastern Canada and four dates being held in Western Canada. In May 1997, a ninth Edgefest date in London, Ontario was added to the tour. Beginning on June 26, the festival toured through London, Barrie, Montr√©al, Quebec; Ottawa, Ontario; Vancouver, British Columbia; Calgary, Alberta; Edmonton, Alberta; Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; and concluded in Winnipeg, Manitoba on September 1, 1997. 25 bands performed during the tour, with Collective Soul, I Mother Earth, Our Lady Peace, The Tea Party, Finger Eleven, Glueleg and The Age of Electric performing at each show (though The Age of Electric missed the Ottawa show due to their gear arriving too late to the venue). 35,000 people attended the Barrie show. 13,000 attended the Montreal show. 20,000 attended the Ottawa show. 23,000 attended the Calgary show. An estimated 27,000 attended the Edmonton show. 18,000 attended the Winnipeg show. 1998 Edgefest in Vancouver, British Columbia. The 1998 Edgefest tour was similar, with eight shows in eight cities. The lineups varied between the cities, but each show featured American bands Foo Fighters, Green Day, and Creed and Canadian bands Econoline Crush, The Killjoys, Matthew Good Band, Sloan, The Tea Party and The Watchmen. The Barrie show again sold out with 35,000 attendees. The Calgary show had an increase in attendance from the previous year with 27,000 attendees. However, both Ottawa and Edmonton had a decline in attendees from the previous year. The 1999 tour was headlined by Hole and Moist. Other performers on the tour included Big Wreck, Gob, Len, Rascalz, Serial Joe, Silverchair and Wide Mouth Mason. Because the show on July 1 sold out in less than a week, a second show was added in Barrie. While the first Barrie show had an attendance of 35,000, the rest of the shows on the tour had varied attendances between 13,000 and 20,000. =Final Molson Park shows (2000‚Äì2003)= In 2000, Edgefest went back to having just one show on Canada Day at Molson Park. Creed graduated to the main stage, which also featured Filter, Goldfinger, Headstones and Limblifter. Playing the side stage that year were 3 Doors Down and Nickelback. 35,000 people attended the year's show. In 2001, Edgefest held the traditional Canada Day show at Molson Park, which was headlined by Tool. Due to a late start, the band played a very short set, angering fans. Edgefest 2001 also featured the first appearance of Billy Talent at the festival. August of that year featured an Edgefest tour which was headlined by Blink 182 and also featured New Found Glory and Sum 41. Locations of the tour included Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City and Montreal. For the next sold out Edgefest in 2002, emergency crews were busy all day treating sunstroke, heat exhaustion, and dehydration. Musically, Nickelback moved up from the side stage to headliners; other bands included Cake (who left the stage 20 minutes into their set after being pelted with bottles), Thirty Seconds to Mars, Default, Simple Plan and Theory of a Deadman. There were also several Edgefest II dates across the country, including shows in Grand Bend and Halifax. In 2003, there was an outbreak of SARS in Toronto. Bands were nervous to come play there, and insurance companies refused to underwrite tours, fearing lawsuits in case people became infected at a show. Edgefest '03 was delayed until the crisis passed and took place on September 6. The show was billed as \\"The Last Bash in Barrie\\" because of plans to relocate the festival to Toronto's Molson Amphitheatre the following year. The lineup for the festival included The Tragically Hip, Sloan, Our Lady Peace, Stereophonics and Fefe Dobson. =Molson Amphitheatre (2004‚Äì2006)= Edgefest 2004 at Molson Amphitheatre featured Finger Eleven and Good Charlotte; Billy Talent moved up from their previous Edgefest performance in 2002 to the main stage. Other bands featured included Alexisonfire, Jet, The Salads and Something Corporate. Edgefest 2005 was headlined by Billy Talent, and also included Coheed and Cambria, Jakalope and Rise Against. That year for the first time there was a side stage designated for a record label, Underground Operations, on which Bombs Over Providence, Closet Monster and Hostage Life, among others, played. As 2006 was the twentieth year of Edgefest, two shows were scheduled. The first, billed as Edgefest I, took place on July 1. Headliners Our Lady Peace brought fans on stage, encouraged them to use their cameras (use of which was always prohibited) and even allowed them to record an unreleased song, Kiss on the Mouth. Singer Raine Maida asked for a fan's audio recorder and sang into it, as well as into the microphone, during that song. Other bands featured included Keane, Mobile, Neverending White Lights and Hot Hot Heat. On July 16, Edgefest II took place. It had three stages ‚Äì the main stage, the Edge Next Big Thing side stage, and the Bedlam Society/Dine Alone Stage, another record label-based stage. Bands performing at Edgefest II included Yellowcard, The All-American Rejects, Story of the Year and The Miniatures. =Downsview Park (2008‚Äì2013)= After there being no Edgefest in 2007, Edgefest returned on July 12, 2008. For the first time since the festival's beginning, the festival was not held at Molson Park nor the Ontario Place Forum/Molson Amphitheatre grounds. Instead, the festival was held at Downsview Park. The 2008 edition featured headlining band Linkin Park and also included Stone Temple Pilots, Sam Roberts and The Bravery. Edgefest 2009 was held on June 20 at Downsview Park. The festival organizers were working with a reduced budget, and the ticket prices were lowered. Billy Talent were the headliners. Other main stage acts included AFI, Alexisonfire, k-os, The Stills, Arkells, and Metric. In 2010, 102.1 The Edge opted to forgo a day-long festival for several concerts throughout the summer months called \\"The Edge Summer Concert Series\\". Edgefest 2011 at Downsview Park featured Rise Against, A Perfect Circle and The Weakerthans. EdgeFest 2012 at Downsview Park featured Billy Talent, Death from above 1979, Silversun Pickups, The Sheepdogs, Young the Giant, and Mushy Callahan. Edgefest 2013 was headlined by The Lumineers. =Echo Beach (2014‚Äì2015)= In 2014 and 2015, Edgefest was put on as a three-date concert series at TD Echo Beach. There has not been an Edgefest concert in any of the following years, and the festival is presumed to be defunct. Alan Cross has stated that no suitable venue, the weak Canadian dollar, and too much competition from other festivals driving up band prices as reasons why Edgefest has been discontinued.

It is considered to be extinct in the wild since 2005 by the EPBC Act, and was originally found only in Lake Pedder in Tasmania. Range Originally recorded only in Lake Pedder and inflowing streams, after the construction of the Huon-Serpentine dam in 1972 (the \\"new\\" Lake Pedder), its range expanded initially into Lake Gordon and Wedge River. However, by 1980 it had become very rare and no new specimens have been captured in the wild since 1996. Introduced trout are implicated as a major factor in the decline of this species. The species survives in two translocated populations outside its original range, one at Lake Oberon in the Western Arthurs mountain range and one at a modified water supply dam near Strathgordon. Description A small greenish-brown fish, off-white to silvery belly, a profuse irregular and highly variable pattern of alternating off-white and brownish contrasting bands extending into the base of the fins and breaking up into fine spots on the lower part of the sides. Length to 160 mm. Habitat Before the construction of the new lake, this species preferred Lake Pedder itself which was quite shallow surrounded by white sandy beaches and small rooted aquatic vegetation as well as in swamps and low velocity waters with abundant instream organic debris and overhanging terrestrial vegetation. Diet consists of small invertebrates, particularly arthropods and aquatic insect larvae, crustaceans and terrestrial insects especially beetles, flies, cicadas etc. Conservation status *Extinct in the wild status for the EPBC Act since 2005. *Listed as endangered by the IUCN since 2019. Reproduction Females are larger than males. Male genital papilla narrow, whereas female are broad and rounded, most noticeable during breeding season. 150 to 1,200 eggs averaging 1.9 mm to 2.3 mm in diameter when water hardened. Spawning reported to occur in spring (October) at water temperatures of 6.7 to 7.5 ¬∞C.

It was launched in 1995 and is owned and operated by Public Communicators Incorporated, a 501(c)3 non-profit, tax-exempt organization founded in 1974. Distributed principally by Dish Network, DirecTV, and the network's live stream at freespeech.org and on Roku, Free Speech TV has run commercial free since 1995 with support from viewers and foundations. The network claims to \\"amplify underrepresented voices and those working on the front lines of social, economic and environmental justice,\\" bringing viewers an array of daily news programs, independent documentaries and special events coverage, predominantly from a progressive perspective.  History  = 1995-1999 = Free Speech TV is an outgrowth of three projects that attempted to establish wider dissemination of progressive perspectives on television: , a landmark television series seen on public television and cable; The Channel, a network of seven full-time cable channels dedicated to independent media; and the part-time Free Speech TV Program Service, launched in 1995 as an innovative approach to curating and distributing independent media to a distribution network of community access cable stations. Public television stations carried some Free Speech TV's special series, such as Just Solutions: Campaigning for Human Right. The network's pioneering efforts in streaming media online won it accolades such as a 1998 Streamers Award and 1999 Webby Award. = 2000-2006 = In January 2000 ‚Äî as the result of an FCC-mandated public interest channel set-aside ‚Äî Free Speech TV became a national, full-time channel on the Dish Network satellite television system while continuing to build a national network of part-time local cable affiliates. Program highlights from the channel's formative years included live field reporting of the anti- globalization movement spawned at the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle; the 2000 US presidential elections, including Democracy Now!s premiere as a television program at the Republican and Democratic conventions; the September 11 attacks, to which FSTV responded with a daily news report and weekly current affairs program; and extensive coverage of the large global anti-war mobilization and the subsequent U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.Vincent Stehle, The Chronicle of Philanthropy, March 18, 2013, \\"{http://philanthropy.com/article/How-a-Misguided-War-Led-to-a/137985/ Source1}\\", March 19, 2013 = 2007-2010 = In 2007, FSTV moved from Boulder to Denver, covering events inside and outside the 2008 Democratic National Convention, where Barack Obama accepted his party's nomination for president. Over the following years, the network stepped up its daily coverage of national politics with the addition of GRITtv with Laura Flanders,PageOneQ, \\"PageOneQ\\", May 12, 2008, \\"Source 2\\", October 14, 2010 The Big Picture with Thom Hartmann and Al Jazeera English. FSTV's daily news programs‚Äîled by The Thom Hartmann Program and Democracy Now!‚Äîbecame FSTV's top programs in terms of popularity and \\"stickiness\\" (a measure of audience engagement and loyalty). During the Arab Spring, FSTV pre-empted much of its regular non-news programming to Al Jazeera English's acclaimed reporting from Cairo's Tahrir Square and other locations. In 2008, the network piloted its \\"eStudio\\" at the National Conference for Media Reform, where it broadcast and streamed conference plenaries, workshops and special interviews conducted by Amy Goodman, Laura Flanders and Jeff Cohen. Since then, FSTV has taken its eStudio on the road, broadcasting exclusive live coverage from the One Nation March, the Netroots Nation conferences, Take Back the American Dream Conferences, talks held by The Nation and The New School, the Homelessness Marathon and the annual conventions of the NAACP, SEIU and the LOHAS Forum. = 2011-2012 = In 2011 and 2012, FSTV coverage provided a window into efforts to reform workers' rights in Wisconsin and other states, as well as into the Occupy Wall Street movement. To facilitate a national dialogue about growing economic disparities, the network produced Occupy the Media, a weekly, live, call-in program that featured frontline activists, policymakers and those bearing the brunt of economic injustice. The series offered a national television platform for many of our peers in progressive radio, print and online journalism. FSTV served as the broadcast hub for national May Day coverage coordinated by The Media Consortium in 2012. The network secured a national channel on DirecTV in 2010; piloted its first OTT (\\"over-the-top\\") channel, on Roku, in 2011; and launched full-time cable channels in Burlington, Vermont, and Ashland, Oregon, in 2012. The website www.freespeech.org was redesigned to better support online video and aggregated content, and the network stepped up its social media engagement on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other sites. FSTV and GM Jon Stout were the recipients of the 2010 National Professional Freedom and Responsibility Award, presented by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. This award recognizes individuals and organizations for \\"a profound commitment to free expression; ethics; media criticism and accountability; racial, gender, and cultural inclusiveness; and public service.\\" Past recipients include Bill Moyers, George Seldes, Molly Ivins, Noam Chomsky, Nina Totenberg, and Studs Terkel. = 2013-present = In 2013, FSTV started conferring with public television stations to gain over-the-air and cable carriage in major urban markets. Mobile apps for smartphones and tablets are in development. The shutdown of the progressive channel Current TV and its replacement with Al Jazeera America had major ramifications on the network. In August 2013 Free Speech TV lost its popular Al Jazeera English News Hour, The Stream and Fault Lines shows when Al Jazeera launched Al Jazeera America. The news programming was replaced with news from France 24. On September 9, 2013 Bill Press joined the channel with his simulcast of The Bill Press Show, which moved over from the defunct Current TV. In January 2014 the channel added The Stephanie Miller Show, also from the defunct Current TV after a successful Indiegogo campaign to raise funds to build the show's new radio / TV studio, buy equipment and produce the show. This reunites the former Current TV morning block on Free Speech TV. In October 2013 Free Speech TV and Karel.Media in association with Brandon Riley Miller Productions launched \\"Karel's Life In Segments\\" starring openly gay, history-making entertainer and former KFI AM 640 Los Angeles and KGO AM 810 Host Charles Karel Bouley. The show would pioneer the format of reality-talk, a new hybrid half-hour that takes characters and issues in the day-to-day life of a daily talk show host and turns them in to entertaining and informative talk segments set either in studio, in Karel's home or around his home of Long Beach, CA. The show has also gone on location internationally including Ireland for Season Three.. The show entered its fourth season as a weekly member of the programming lineup in 2017 with a fifth season being planned. In October 2014, Free Speech TV launched Uprising with Sonali, featuring Sonali Kolhatkar in partnership with Pacifica Radio station KPFK-FM, Los Angeles. Uprising Radio was the longest running daily morning show on Southern California public radio before premiering as a television show on Free Speech TV. The show is the first ever national daily news show hosted and produced by an immigrant woman of color, Sonali Kolhatkar. In recent years, FSTV's television footprint has grown to more than 40 million homes. The network's monthly viewership (cume) nearly doubled to more than 1 million households over a two-year period between 2012-2014. The closing of Current TV and the accumulation of its popular radio shows and audience combined with the movement of MSNBC out of the progressive sphere have partially contributed to the trend.  Funding  Free Speech TV is a project of Public Communicators, Inc., a non-profit, 501c3 tax-exempt organization FSTV is supported primarily through philanthropic contributions from thousands of viewers and from foundations dedicated to independent media and social, economic and environmental justice. Availability FSTV is currently available in more than 40 million television homes nationwide, airing full-time on Dish Network (9415), DirecTV (348), Burlington Telecom (122) and Ashland Home Net (96). Select programs are syndicated on 177 community cable stations in 40 states. FSTV is also available as a 24/7 linear feed and as videos-on-demand‚Äîon freespeech.org and on Roku, an \\"over-the-top\\" distribution platform that streams video over the Internet onto connected television sets. Other content is syndicated on Facebook, YouTube, Blip.tv, Vimeo and other social networking sites.

The album was released in February 2006 on the Italian label Frontiers Records, the band supporting the album with a world tour. It was the band's first studio release since Through the Looking Glass in 2002, the last one with lead vocalist Bobby Kimball and the only one with keyboardist/vocalist Greg Phillinganes. Phillinganes originally began playing with Toto as a touring replacement for David Paich, who had retired from the road. Another Porcaro brother, Steve, continues to work in the studio with the band, though he also retired from touring following the Fahrenheit album in 1987. Similarly, Lenny Castro has never been a member of the group, but has consistently contributed to their recordings since their first album in 1978. This is also the band's last studio album to feature bassist Mike Porcaro and drummer Simon Phillips; Porcaro retired from touring in the following year due to an ALS and died in 2015 (though he would posthumously appear on the 2018 album Old Is New on select tracks). Phillips left the band in 2014 to focus on his solo career. Other guest artists appearing on the album include then-former lead vocalist Joseph Williams, saxophonist Tom Scott, Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, Chicago trombonist James Pankow and former Chicago bassist and vocalist Jason Scheff. Reception AllMusic's review of the album was mixed (3.5/5), calling the album derivative, with little focus until halfway through, and saying that Toto was \\"a band trying to find itself during a midlife crisis.\\" They praised Steve Lukather's vocals and the band's \\"amazing production values\\".

Bugs is wise to his game but plays along, just to stifle his boredom. Big Bad admits Bugs in, and tricks him into signing an insurance form. Bugs' first initiation test is to ring a bell, rigged to cut a rope and let a safe fall on him. Bugs ticks off Big Bad by ringing the bell with a nail and a nickel. When Big Bad tells Bugs to hit the bell, Bugs merely flicks it, so Big Bad comes up to demonstrate himself how to do it. Big Bad gets flattened as a result. Big Bad then tests out his next plan, to signal his nephew, so Big Bad's nephew will fling open a closet door, rigged to close an iron maiden on Bugs. Big Bad beckons Bugs for his club picture, with the iron maiden as a backdrop. Bugs pulls all sorts of poses, so Big Bad comes up to demonstrate the right pose. Bugs immediately says \\"I get it now,\\" which signals the nephew to close the iron maiden‚Äîbut instead closes it on his uncle. As Bugs steps out, the nephew peeks into the casket, and then closes it again, cringing. Later, Big Bad tells Bugs to crawl through a hole which enters the mouth of a cannon. While Big Bad tells his nephew to pull the cord when he gives him the signal, Bugs paints another hole in the wall. When Big Bad sees there are two holes, Bugs tricks him into going into the booby- trapped one, so Big Bad gets blasted through the wall. Bugs then flips the wall so that when Big Bad demands a retry, he prevents Bugs from going into the booby-trapped one and gets blasted through the wall again. Finally, Big Bad directs Bugs to climb inside a hollowed-out tree. Bugs climbs out when he sees the wolf pack it with explosives. The dynamite detonates and causes the tree to crash onto the Club Del Conejo. A battered Big Bad suggests opening a chicken club, and Foghorn Leghorn immediately appears eager to join. The cartoon closes with Bugs, sitting at a tree with the wolf's nephew, remarking: \\"I wonder which one will chicken out first\\".

After graduating from Annandale High School in Northern Virginia in 1969, Nasworthy attended Virginia Tech for a year. Back with his family for the summer of 1970, he visited a plastics factory in Purcellville called Creative Urethane, owned by a friend‚Äôs father. The factory had experimented with a polyurethane roller skate wheel that was sold to Roller Sports Inc., which supplied wheels for rental skates at roller rinks. The rationale was that a softer wheel with improved grip would help novice roller skaters, but the wheel was largely rejected by roller skaters who favored the hard steel wheels that allowed for faster speeds on the wooden floors of the roller rinks. Up to this point, skateboards had also been manufactured with either the same steel wheels as rollerskates, or out of a clay composite ‚Äì a combination of plastic, paper, and finely ground walnut shells.Davidson, J (1985) Sport and Modern Technology. The Rise of Skateboarding, 1963‚Äì1978, Journal of Popular Culture, 18 (4) pp145-157. These wheels wore out far too quickly, in as little as seven or eight hours. Nasworthy moved to Southern California in 1971 to surf and noticed that kids were trying to skateboard when the surf was down. He thought the soft polyurethane wheels would be ideal for skateboards, and had his father send him 10 sets. Assembling them onto his skateboard, he discovered they allowed for a much smoother ride that was fast and controllable. Having realized the potential of a polyurethane skateboard wheel, Nasworthy invested $700, which he had accumulated working in a restaurant, and formed the Cadillac Wheels Company (on account of their smooth ride).Pileggi, S (September 1, 1975) ‚ÄúWheeling and Dealing‚Äù, Sports Illustrated, pp22-24. Creative Urethane made the wheels to his specifications and Nasworthy took his company to California in 1972. Due to the infancy of skateboarding at this time, Nasworthy sold his wheels directly to surf shops along the coast of California, and placed some tentative advertisements featuring a young Gregg Weaver in surfing magazines. News of the wheels initially spread by word of mouth, but the cumulative effect was a reawakening of skateboarding to the extent that, by 1975, scores of manufacturers had entered the market, a national magazine, Skateboarder, had re-formed, and Nasworthy was selling 300,000 sets of wheels per year.Roberts, T (July 5, 1976) ‚ÄúOn The Move‚Äù, People Magazine, pp32-35. Nasworthy decided to license his wheels to Bahne and Co. of Encinitas, California and Bahne skateboards were packaged with Cadillac wheels. During 1975, the company reported sales of 10‚Äì20,000 skateboards per month. Nasworthy's association with Bahne led him to commission a series of paintings by poster artist Jim Evans that featured Cadillac Wheels. The posters, with titles like, \\"From Out of the West\\" and \\"Accept No Substitutes\\" came to represent the paradigm shift taking place in skateboarding. This success did not last long, as Nasworthy‚Äôs innovation was soon overtaken by the introduction of a precision bearing skateboard wheel, the Road Rider. But Nasworthy‚Äôs discovery was the catalyst for the second skateboard boom. As a professional freestyle competitor at the time noted: :The progress of the urethane [sic] wheels just totally stoked me; you could do so much more on a skateboard, surf moves, especially; you could carve your turns and stuff without sliding, that changed everything a lot. Nasworthy completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mechanics at University of California San Diego in 1984. After earning his degree, he pursued a career as a mechanical engineer. Most of his career was spent at Hewlett Packard where he helped to develop the first wide format Thermal Inkjet Printer and filed patents regarding paper handling. Nasworthy continued inventing and creating at D&K; Engineering from 2011 to 2015, and Simplexity Product Development from 2015 until his retirement in 2017.

Early years Axel Petersson D√∂derhultarn was born in the parish of D√∂derhult in Oskarshamn Municipality. His parents were Eva Lotta Persdotter and Per August Petersso. When he was five years of age, his father dies. Members of his family decided the best thing for him to do as a young adult was to emigrate to the United States. Petersson did not emigrate to America, as his family had planned, and after a brief time away he moved back to help his widowed mother in Oskarshamn. In his youth, his primary interest was in whittling, and carving small figures. He worked on figure carving and sold figurines in the local market in Oskarshamn. Most of the figures he sold were refined traditional wood carvings. Sometime around 1900 he began to carve in a minimalist style. These are the carved figures he is most famous for. Many of these carvings sold in the local market for ($1.00-$2.00)USD. Adjusted for inflation what cost $1.50 in 1900 would cost $33.23 in 2005. Recognition In 1909, Petersson was invited to participate in an exhibition in Stockholm. The public response to his work was overwhelming. Georg Nordensvan wrote in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper on 20 January 1909 \\"Axel Petersson's old men are irresistibly amusing. The depict such primitive art as one could wish for, made out of a couple of simple contours using only a couple of strokes, but, from an artist with sure eye and nimble hands. It is a new conception with a personal touch...small masterpieces of complete nonconformative art.\\" After his success with the Stockholm exhibition some of the museums in Sweden began purchasing his work. He had many requests to exhibit his work throughout Europe and the United States. In 1911 fifty-seven of his figures were on display in Oskarshamn, and the groundwork was laid for a D√∂derhultarn Museum. His work was also features in exhibitions in Copenhagen, Brighton, Rome and Turin during 1911. The next year some of his work was shipped to the United States and the Swedish Consulate sent it on tour in several major cities; in New York City (1913) and in San Francisco and Chicago (1915). Legacy D√∂derhultarn became known as one of Sweden's great artists. His work as well as photos of his work were circulated world wide. and he served as an inspiration to other woodcarvers, including Carl Johan Trygg (1887‚Äì1954) and H. S. \\"Andy\\" Anderson (1892‚Äì1960). His popularity was so great that \\" D√∂derhultarn figure \\" became the generic term for any small figure in the minimalist style.

Hagey (1810‚Äì1876) was the Bishop of the Mennonite Church in Ontario from 1852 until his death in 1876. Bishop Hagey presided over a time of disagreement and schism within the Mennonite Church in Canada. He was married to Sophia Bricker, the daughter of notable Mennonite Samuel Bricker. Bricker, with partner Daniel Erb, arranged for the purchase of the large tracts of land around the Grand River from native leader Joseph Brant through Richard Beasley. This settlement became the city of Waterloo, Ontario. Bishop Hagey succeeded Bishop Benjamin Eby. Early life Hagey was a bishop and farmer; born June 11, 1810, in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to Daniel and Elizabeth (Bergey) Hagey. He and his twin brother, Daniel, had an older brother Jacob, two younger brothers Isaac and Henry, and younger sister Sallie. In 1832, he married Sophia Bricker (December 20, 1810 ‚Äì November 4, 1895). Joseph and Sophia Hagey had six sons and five daughters, Peter, Elizabeth, Daniel, Leah, Rebecca, Samuel, Mary, Joseph, Jacob, Sophia and Henry. Hagey also adopted the orphan Moses Springer in 1834, who went on to become the first mayor of the town of Waterloo, Ontario, in 1876. In 1822, Joseph Hagey came with his family from Pennsylvania after his father Daniel Hagey filed for bankruptcy after the store he operated left him almost $1200 in debt in 1821 and left Pennsylvania to escape the scandal. The Hageys lived on a farm just north of Cambridge, Ontario (Preston). After their marriage, Joseph and Sophia lived on the farm owned by her father; they became the owners in 1837. Ministry Hagey was ordained as a minister on February 10, 1839, most likely by Benjamin Eby. Hagey was ordained bishop to aid the elderly Eby on May 31, 1851. He served as both pastor to the Hagey congregation and as bishop to all the congregations in Waterloo Township. Following in the shadow of the much loved and charismatic Eby, Hagey's tenure and accomplishments were never as widely praised. Towards the end of his career, he was challenged by the divisions revival meetings brought to the Ontario Mennonite Conference. The initial tension was sparked by both a revival in Solomon Eby's congregation in Port Elgin, Ontario, in 1870, and a similar revival within Waterloo County. These meetings were often held in people's homes in the style of the Methodist prayer or revival tent meeting. This often flamboyant and spontaneous style of liturgy was not generally accepted within the Mennonite community at that time. At first Bishop Hagey embraced new converts form these meetings and baptized those from Eby's Port Elgin revival. This changed by the time the Waterloo converts sought baptism, directly because of objections lodged by the conference leadership itself. This group was baptized later in 1871 by an American bishop invited north by the revivalists, letting the matter increase the growing division between the two camps. The resulting division created the break-away group the Reformed Mennonites (later part of the Mennonite Brethren in Christ). Mediation Hagey did assist in several attempts to help resolve a church dispute in Indiana. He was a participant and served as the nominal leader (as bishop) of an Ontario delegation that attempted to mediate the conflict. Death Joseph died December 31, 1876, and was buried in the Breslau Mennonite Cemetery. It was said that three hundred carriages were part of the funeral procession, with one thousand persons in attendance at the service. Eby summary The Eby Book of 1856 had this to say regarding Bishop Hagey: > Bishop Joseph Hagey, the second son of Daniel and Elizabeth (Bergey) Hagey, > was born in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, on June 11, 1810.

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and died in Winter Haven, Florida. His composition \\"Jingle Bells\\" has become synonymous with the Christmas holiday and is one of the most performed and most recognizable songs in the world. Life and career James Lord Pierpont was born on April 25, 1822 in Boston, Massachusetts. His father, the Reverend John Pierpont (1785‚Äì1866), was a pastor of the Hollis Street Unitarian Church in Boston, an abolitionist and a poet. Robert Fulghum confused James with his father in the book It Was On Fire When I Lay Down On It (1989); erroneously attributing the authorship of \\"Jingle Bells\\" to the Rev. John Pierpont. James' mother was Mary Sheldon Lord, the daughter of Lynde Lord, Jr. (1762‚Äì1813), and Mary Lyman. James was the uncle of the financier and banker John Pierpont Morgan.\\"Staking claim to a carol Georgians say 'Jingle Bells' is their song -- not Medford's\\", Boston Globe, December 25, 2003, retrieved December 17, 2011 John and Mary Pierpont had six children. In 1832, James was sent to a boarding school in New Hampshire. He wrote a letter to his mother about riding in a sleigh through the December snow. In 1836, James ran away to sea aboard a whaling ship called the Shark.Daiss, Timothy (2002) Rebels, saints, and sinners: Savannah's rich history and colorful personalities, Pelican, , p. 163 He then served in the US Navy until the age of 21. By 1845, he returned to New England where his father was the pastor of a Unitarian congregation in Troy, New York. James married Millicent Cowee, the daughter of Farwell Cowee and Abigail Merriam, in the late 1840s, and they settled in Medford, where they had three children. His father, Rev. John Pierpont, assumed a position as minister of a Unitarian congregation in Medford, Massachusetts in 1849. In 1849, James Pierpont left his wife and children with his father in Massachusetts to open a business in San Francisco during the California Gold Rush. He also worked as a photographer. His business failed after his goods burned in a fire. In 1856, Millicent died,See Medford, Mass Census 1855, Millie is still alive. and after James' brother, the Rev. John Pierpont, Jr. (1819‚Äì1879), accepted a post with the Savannah, Georgia, Unitarian congregation, James followed, taking a post as the organist and music director of the church. To support himself, he also gave organ and singing lessons. The organ is presently in the possession of Florida State University. On March 27, 1852, James Pierpont published his composition \\"The Returned Californian\\", based on his experiences in San Francisco, published in Boston by E. H. Wade of 197 Washington Street. \\"The Returned Californian\\" was originally sung by S. C. Howard, of Ordway's Aeloians, and was written expressly for Ordway's Aeolians \\"by James Pierpont Esq.\\" and was arranged by John Pond Ordway (1824‚Äì1880). The song describes Pierpont's experiences during the California Gold Rush and the failure of his San Francisco business: \\"Oh! I'm going far away from my Creditors just now, I ain't the tin to pay 'em and they're kicking up a row.\\" The U.S. Library of Congress possesses a copy of the original sheet music for the song. The lyrics to \\"The Returned Californian\\" are as follows: > Oh, I'm going far away from my Creditors just now, I ain't the tin to pay > 'em and they're kicking up a row; I ain't one of those lucky ones that works > for 'Uncle Sam,' There's no chance for speculation and the mines ain't worth > a ('d--') Copper. There's my tailor vowing vengeance and he swears he'll > give me Fitts, And Sheriff's running after me with pockets full of writs; > And which ever way I turn, I am sure to meet a dun, So I guess the best > thing I can do, is just to cut and run. Oh! I wish those 'tarnel critters > that wrote home about the gold Were in the place the Scriptures say 'is > never very cold;' For they told about the heaps of dust and lumps so mighty > big, But they never said a single word how hard they were to dig. So I went > up to the mines and I helped to turn a stream, And got trusted on the > strength of that delusive golden dream; But when we got to digging we found > 'twas all a sham, And we who dam'd the rivers by our creditors were damn'd. > Oh! I'm going far away but I don't know where I'll go, I oughter travel > homeward but they'll laugh at me I know; For I told 'em when I started I was > bound to make a pile, But if they could only see mine now I rather guess > they'd smile. If of these United States I was the President, No man that > owed another should ever pay a cent; And he who dunn'd another should be > banished far away, And attention to the pretty girls is all a man should > pay. In 1853, Pierpont had published new compositions in Boston, among them \\"Kitty Crow\\", dedicated to W. W. McKim, and \\"The Colored Coquette\\", a minstrel song published by Oliver Ditson. \\"The Coquette\\" and an arrangement for guitar entitled \\"The Coquet\\" were also published that year. Pierpont also published an arrangement entitled \\"The Universal Medley\\". In 1854, Pierpont composed the songs \\"Geraldine\\" and \\"Ring the Bell, Fanny\\" for George Kunkle's Nightingale Opera Troupe. He also copyrighted the song \\"To the Loved Ones at Home\\" in 1854 and \\"Poor Elsie\\", a ballad, written and arranged expressly for Campbell's Minstrels, who were rivals to Christy's Minstrels. In 1855, he composed \\"The Starlight Serenade\\", published by Miller and Beacham in Baltimore. Pierpont also composed \\"I Mourn For My Old Cottage Home\\". In 1857, Pierpont had another successful hit song composition with a song written in collaboration with lyricist Marshall S. Pike, \\"The Little White Cottage\\" or \\"Gentle Nettie Moore\\", published by Oliver Ditson and Company, and copyrighted on September 16, 1857. The songwriting credit appeared as: \\"Poetry by Marshall S. Pike, Esq.\\", the \\"Melody by G. S. P.\\", and \\"Chorus and Piano Accompaniment by J. S. [sic] Pierpont\\". Pierpont's name occasionally appeared incorrectly as \\"J. S. Pierpont\\". Jamie Keena (musician), a balladeer and authority on 19th century music, who plays the guitar, banjo, fife, hammered dulcimer, and concertina, has recorded several Pierpont compositions from this period. The Pierpont compositions that were performed by Keena included \\"Ring the Bell, Fanny\\" (1854), \\"Quitman Town March\\", and \\"Wait, Lady, Wait\\", as well as three Confederacy songs written in the 1860s, \\"Our Battle Flag\\", \\"We Conquer or Die\\" (1861), and \\"Strike for the South\\" (1863). Pierpont published several ballads, polkas, such as \\"The Know Nothing Polka\\", published by E. H. Wade in 1854, and minstrel songs. Minstrel songs were popular in the 1850s and continued to be popular into the 20th century in the U.S. The lyrics to all minstrel songs reflect and mirror the endemic racism and racial stereotypes inherent in American society and culture. Minstrel songs and the minstrel genre exploited racial stereotypes and racially stereotypical language. The minstrel genre, however, was only a representation of the wider societal racism in the United States. In August 1857, James married Eliza Jane Purse, daughter of Savannah's mayor, Thomas Purse. She soon gave birth to the first of their children, Lillie. Pierpont's children by his first marriage remained in Massachusetts with their grandfather. In August 1857, his song \\"The One Horse Open Sleigh\\" was published by Oliver Ditson and Company of 277 Washington Street in Boston dedicated to John P. Ordway. The song was copyrighted on September 16, 1857. The song was originally performed in a Sunday school concert on Thanksgiving in Savannah, Georgia, although it has been claimed that Pierpont wrote it in Medford, Massachusetts in 1850. In 1859, it was re-released with the title \\"Jingle Bells, or The One Horse Open Sleigh\\". The song was not a hit as Pierpont had originally published it. The original lyrics to \\"The One Horse Open Sleigh\\" as written by James Lord Pierpont in 1857 are as follows: The commemorative plaque for James Lord Pierpont and his \\"Jingle Bells\\" in Savannah, Georgia, USA > Dashing thro' the snow, In a one-horse open sleigh, O'er the hills we go, > Laughing all the way; Bells on bob tail ring, Making spirits bright, Oh what > sport to ride and sing A sleighing song to night. Jingle bells, Jingle > bells, Jingle all the way; Oh! what joy it is to ride In a one horse open > sleigh. Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way; Oh! what joy it is > to ride In a one horse open sleigh. A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a > ride, And soon Miss Fannie Bright Was seated by my side, The horse was lean > and lank; Misfortune seemed his lot, He got into a drifted bank, And we, we > got upsot. A day or two ago, The story I must tell I went out on the snow > And on my back I fell; A gent was riding by In a one-horse open sleigh, He > laughed as there I sprawling lie, But quickly drove away. Now the ground is > white Go it while you're young, Take the girls to night And sing this > sleighing song; Just get a bob tailed bay Two forty as his speed. Hitch him > to an open sleigh And crack, you'll take the lead. Later arrangements of the song made minor alterations to the lyrics and introduced a new, simpler melody for the chorus. In this modified form, \\"Jingle Bells\\" became one of the most popular and most recognizable songs ever written. In 1859, the Unitarian Church in Savannah had closed because of its abolitionist position, which was unpopular in the South. By 1860, the Rev. John Pierpont, Jr. had returned to the North. James, however, stayed in Savannah with his second wife Eliza Jane, and at the beginning of the Civil War, joined the Lamar Rangers, which became part of the Fifth Georgia Cavalry of the Confederacy. Records indicate that he served as a company clerk. He also wrote music for the Confederacy when it seceded from the Union, including \\"Our Battle Flag\\", \\"Strike for the South\\" and \\"We Conquer or Die\\". His father also saw military service as a chaplain with the Union Army stationed in Washington, D.C. and later worked for the U.S. Treasury Department. Pierpont and his father were on opposite sides during the Civil War. After the war, James moved his family to Valdosta, Georgia, where he taught music. According to Savannah author Margaret DeBolt and researcher Milton J. Rahn, Pierpont's son, Maynard Boardman, was born in Valdosta. The 1870 Lowndes County Census listed: \\"Pierpont, James 48, Eliza J. 38, Lillie 16, Thomas 8, Josiah 5, and Maynard B. 4.\\" If Lillie is 16 in 1870, she was born in about 1854. In 1869, Pierpont moved to Quitman, Georgia. There he was the organist in the Presbyterian Church, gave private piano lessons and taught at the Quitman Academy, retiring as the head of the Musical Department. In 1880, Pierpont's son, Dr. Juriah Pierpont, M.D., renewed the copyright on \\"Jingle Bells\\" but he never made much money from it. It took considerable effort to keep his father's name permanently attached to the song after the copyright expired. More information about Dr. Pierpont can be found at Pensacola Medical Heritage on St. John's Historic Cemetery web page. Pierpont spent his final days at his son's home in Winter Haven, Florida, where he died on August 5, 1893.

The Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. at Navy Pier Chicago, Illinois Bubba Gump Shrimp Company Restaurant & Market is an American seafood restaurant chain inspired by the 1994 film Forrest Gump. As of July 2015, forty Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants operate worldwide. Twenty-nine of these locations are in the United States, four are in Mexico, three are in Japan, and one each in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Canada, the Marianas the Philippines and Qatar. The company is based in Houston, Texas, and has been a division of Landry's Restaurants since 2010. The first Bubba Gump restaurant opened in 1996 in Monterey, California by Rusty Pelican Restaurants in partnership with Viacom. Viacom is owner of Paramount Pictures, the distributor of Forrest Gump. The Bubba Gump restaurant is named after the film's characters Benjamin Buford \\"Bubba\\" Blue and Forrest Gump. In the film, Bubba suggested getting in the shrimping business and, ultimately, Forrest pursued the idea after Bubba's death in the Vietnam War.  History  In 1995, Paramount Pictures approached Rusty Pelican Restaurants Inc. with a desire to create a restaurant based on a theme from Paramount's 1994 film Forrest Gump. The Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. was created as a result. Within a year the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. created a concept idea for the restaurant chain which was then licensed by Paramount Licensing, Inc. In 1996, the first Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurant was opened in Monterey, California; its success led to its franchising on an international scale. In November 2010, Landry's, Inc. acquired Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. for an undisclosed amount. The Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. purchase also included a lone Rusty Pelican in Newport Beach, California. Bubba Gump Restaurant in Hong Kong Like the name suggests, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.'s menu consists mostly of shrimp dishes and other seafood, as well as Southern and Cajun cuisine. The restaurant offers dishes named after characters in the movie, like Jenny's Catch and the restaurant's bestseller Forrest's Seafood Feast. Restaurants display movie memorabilia throughout the restaurant. Guests can play Forrest Gump movie trivia and can signal their waiter with a ‚ÄúStop, Forrest, Stop‚Äù sign.  Miscellaneous  = Employee social media policy = In 2013, a former Bubba Gump employee claimed that the social media policy in the company's employee handbook had a restrictive effect on employees‚Äô rights by prohibiting them from discussing their jobs online. In 2015, a National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge ruled that Bubba Gump did not violate employees‚Äô rights as they did not explicitly prohibit employees from discussing job- related subjects, but only expected them to do so in a civil manner. There have been many cases in the last few years in which the National Labor Relations Board found companies social media policies to be overboard, and ruled in favor of the employee(s). = Chris Pratt = Actor Chris Pratt was discovered in 2000 while working as a waiter at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in Maui, Hawaii.

She started her career as a singer in Radio Tirana (1945), before making her breakthrough appearance as an actress in the film The Great Warrior Skanderbeg (1953). With all the successful performances made in film, she remained a great actress of the Albanian cinema and icon of the Albanian National Theater. For her contributions she has received honorary titles People's Artist of Albania (1975) and Honor of Nation Order (2015). Early life Marie was born in Shkod√´r, Albania. Her father, Palok √áur√ßija, was a craftsman and her mother, Roza, was a housewife. Marie was very early introduced to home financial difficulties and to social dramas of the time also reflected in her family as well. She was enrolled at Stigmatine Sisters School of Shkod√´r, a girls school. Later on, Marie Logoreci joined the gymnasium. She was gifted at drawing and singing. During her singing she started to accompany herself a mandolin and a guitar. She did not like math and religious classes. From her childhood only 20 drawings have survived; they are witness of a mild and delicate spirit by showing a fine capture of the object, an observant eye, and a harmony in colors and precision. She also learned Italian and Montenegrin as a child. What mostly traced her soul were the popular narrations, legends and epic songs of the Northern Albania that she heard around her family. Her knowledge of the Albanian folklore and ethnography was soon to be her new passion. When she was 17 she moved permanently to Tirana. She married Kol√´ Logoreci, an economist who had just come back from his studies in Vienna. As a hobby Kol√´ also was a member of Society of Friends of Music in Vienna, for almost five years getting lessons on violin. Kol√´ had an excellent career as the Chief of State Budget Department. He was also a recipient of the high title Order of Skanderbeg. Kol√´ was the son of Mati Logoreci himself a very distinguished teacher and linguist, a man of social reputation at his time. He was a descendant of Logoreci family, whose name dates from the years 1300 with the name Logoreseos. Artistic life =Singer at Radio Tirana= Marie's artistic life began as a singer for Radio Tirana in 1945 where she sang solo. She sang folk songs of Shkod√´r and Middle Albania in live radio broadcast. Meanwhile, she attended a one-year study of canto at Tirana artistic lyceum under the guidance of soprano Jorgjia Fil√ße-Truja (People's Artist of Albania). Marie also made her appearance in various concerts in Albania and Bulgaria. She has sung around 100 different songs in Radio Tirana during the 1945‚Äì1947 years. =Stage Acting= In 1947 she was a leading singer with the National Chorus giving tour concerts in Albania and abroad. That same year she was offered to play dramas as a lead actress in the National Theater of Albania. As a stage actress she's filled a vast gallery of unforgettable characters as in the way she acted them out masterfully, the way she expressed and manifested them. The range of her leading roles is wide enough to comprise characters of quite opponent with one another in mould and psychology. Her professional performing reached emotional borders swinging from bright sides of human psyche to the darkest features of it. She will be unforgettable in the following works: * As Alisa Lengton, the whimsical conservative and racist bourgeois lady in the play Deep Roots. * As Gertrude, the suicidal queen in Hamlet. * As Fatime, the woman experienced in court intrigues, servile and arrogant, in Halili and Hajria. * As Bernarda Alba, the dark cold lady of The House of Bernarda Alba drama from Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. Marie Logoreci has performed in 40 stage dramas. All her performances of Shakespeare's, of Moli√®re's, of Lorca's, or Gorky's dramas, as well as them of the Albanian authors‚ÄîKole Jakova, Ndreke Luca etc.‚Äîdemonstrated her particular artistic abilities, and all outlined her portrait as an artist of individuality, and reflects harmony between her acting and her external plastics. She had managed to have a clear knowledge of the acoustics; she'd achieved such a virtuosity in her actions bridging the distance between her and the audience. Her dynamics and her temperament had marked her voice with a high key of intonation which was suggestive in her stage performances. Marie's long career as an actress brought her the interest to try directing. As a stage director she has also made an important contribution. =Movie Actress= Marie was one of the pioneers of the Albanian movies. She had a role in the very first Albanian movie, a short feature of about 12 minutes long, produced by the Albanian Film Studio and Albanian Television. Marie's roles in films manifest their particularity and have their value in the history of the Albanian cinematography. The first important film she acted in was The Great Warrior Skanderbeg. The most unforgettable role played by her in a movie is that of \\"Loke\\" in \\"Toka Jone\\" (Our Land). Her art Marie remained a great stage actress. She shaped her art by observing life carefully. She accumulated enough experience so she could input it later in her performances. In front of the spectators she created in stage the human soul, pain, protest, revolt, hate, cynicism, hypocrisy, and cunning; she offered them the magic of the play, what the real art can invoke. Her artistic lingo was expressive; her stage gestures demanded and were applied with masterly affection, and Marie gave life to all those performances signing up her individuality and personal stature in art. Marie Logoreci survived in art lovers' memories as a candid, simple and sincere human being, a woman of a great knowledge and art mastery. At the same time she is remembered by many young artists as someone extremely pleasant to talk to with or to get advice from.

The concept originated during the Cold War. Typical depictions of the tactic are of a satellite containing a magazine of tungsten rods and a directional thrust system. (In science fiction, the weapon is often depicted as being launched from a spaceship, instead of a satellite.) When a strike is ordered, the launch vehicle brakes; - the word \\"brake\\" in this paragraph refers to the act of braking; the fact that by slowing the rod's orbital trajectory, the satellite can de-orbit it in order to drop it onto the planet below. one of the rods out of its orbit and into a suborbital trajectory that intersects the target. As the rod approaches periapsis due to gravity, it picks up immense speed until it reaches terminal velocity shortly before impact. The rods would typically be shaped to minimize air resistance and maximize terminal velocity. Kinetic bombardment has the advantage of being able to deliver projectiles from a very high angle at a very high speed, making them extremely difficult to defend against. In addition, projectiles would not require explosive warheads, and--in the simplest designs--would consist entirely of solid metal rods, giving rise to the common nickname \\"rods from God\\". Disadvantages include the technical difficulties of ensuring accuracy and the high costs of positioning ammunition in orbit.  Real life concepts and theories  During the Korean and Vietnam Wars, there was limited use of the Lazy Dog bomb, a kinetic projectile shaped like a conventional bomb but only about 25.4 mm (1\\") long and 9.525 mm (3/8\\") diameter. A piece of sheet metal was folded to make the fins and welded to the rear of the projectile. These were dumped from aircraft onto enemy troops and had the same effect as a machine gun fired vertically. Similar flechette projectiles have been used since the first World War. Project Thor is an idea for a weapons system that launches telephone pole-sized kinetic projectiles made from tungsten from Earth's orbit to damage targets on the ground. Jerry Pournelle created the concept while working in operations research at Boeing in the 1950s before becoming a science-fiction writer. A system described in the 2003 United States Air Force report was that of , tungsten rods that are satellite- controlled and have global strike capability, with impact speeds of Mach 10. The bomb would naturally contain a large kinetic energy because it moves at orbital velocities, around 8 kilometers per second in orbit and 3 kilometers per second or Mach 10 at impact. As the rod reenters Earth's atmosphere it would lose most of the velocity, but the remaining energy would cause considerable damage. Some systems are quoted as having the yield of a small tactical nuclear bomb. These designs are envisioned as a bunker buster. As the name suggests, the 'bunker buster' is powerful enough to destroy a nuclear bunker. With 6‚Äì8 satellites on a given orbit, a target could be hit within 12‚Äì15 minutes from any given time, less than half the time taken by an ICBM and without the launch warning. Such a system could also be equipped with sensors to detect incoming anti-ballistic missile-type threats and relatively light protective measures to use against them (e.g. Hit-To-Kill Missiles or megawatt-class chemical laser). The time between deorbit and impact would only be a few minutes, and depending on the orbits and positions in the orbits, the system would have a worldwide range. There would be no need to deploy missiles, aircraft or other vehicles. In the case of the system mentioned in the 2003 Air Force report above, a tungsten cylinder impacting at Mach 10 has a kinetic energy equivalent to approximately 11.5 tons of TNT (or 7.2 tons of dynamite). The mass of such a cylinder is itself greater than 9 tons, so the practical applications of such a system are limited to those situations where its other characteristics provide a clear and decisive advantage‚Äîa conventional bomb/warhead of similar weight to the tungsten rod, delivered by conventional means, provides similar destructive capability and is far more practical and cost-effective. The highly elongated shape and high mass of the projectiles are intended to enhance sectional density (and therefore minimize kinetic energy loss due to air friction) and maximize penetration of hard or buried targets. The larger device is expected to be quite effective at penetrating deeply buried bunkers and other command and control targets.History Television, The Universe, season 4, episode 8, \\"Space Wars\\"; referring to rod from God The weapon would be very hard to defend against. It has a very high closing velocity and small radar cross-section. Launch is difficult to detect. Any infrared launch signature occurs in orbit, at no fixed position. The infrared launch signature also has a much smaller magnitude compared to a ballistic missile launch. The system would also have to cope with atmospheric heating from re-entry, which could melt non-tungsten components of the weapon. The phrase \\"rods from God\\" is also used to describe the same concept. An Air Force report called them \\"hypervelocity rod bundles\\". In June 2020, a senior Al Qaeda leader was killed by a kinetic weapon (a modified AGM-114 Hellfire missile) dropped by a United States Special Operations General Atomics MQ-1 Predator drone. The weapon reportedly weighed 100 pounds and contained 6 deployed blades to destroy the passenger vehicle that was targeted.  In science fiction  In the mid-1960s, popular science interest in orbital mechanics led to a number of science fiction stories which explored their implications. Among these was The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein in which the citizens of the Moon bombard the Earth with rocks wrapped in iron containers which are in turn fired from an electromagnetic launch system at Earth-based targets. In the 1970s and 1980s this idea was refined in science fiction novels such as Footfall by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (the same Pournelle that first proposed the idea for military use in a non-fiction context), in which aliens use a Thor-type system. During the 1980s and 1990s references to such weapons became a staple of science fiction roleplaying games such as Traveller, Shadowrun and Heavy Gear (the latter game naming these weapons ortillery, a portmanteau of orbital artillery), as well as visual media including Babylon 5's \\"mass drivers\\" and the film Starship Troopers, itself an adaptation of a Heinlein novel of the same name. A smaller \\"crowbar\\" variant is mentioned in David's Sling by Marc Stiegler (Baen, 1988). Set in the Cold War, the story is based on the use of (relatively inexpensive) information-based \\"intelligent\\" systems to overcome an enemy's numerical advantage. The orbital kinetic bombardment system is used first to destroy the Soviet tank armies that have invaded Europe and then to take out Soviet ICBM silos prior to a nuclear strike. In Neal Stephenson's Anathem, a kinetic bombardment weapon is deployed from orbit to trigger the eruption of a dormant volcano. The repurposing of space colonies for use in kinetic bombardment (referred as a \\"colony drop\\") is a frequent element of the Gundam franchise and is central to the plots of Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack, and Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory, while a more limited bombardment is key to the climax of Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans . From the mid-1990s, kinetic weapons as science fiction plot devices appeared in video games. Appearing in Syndicate Wars as a player-usable weapon, it also featured prominently in the plots of other video games, such as Tom Clancy's EndWar, Mass Effect 2, Call of Duty: Ghosts, and Halo. Halo features the Magnetic Accelerator Cannon (MAC), or Mass Accelerator Cannon, as the primary weapon system employed by the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) on its warships and orbital defense platforms. Essentially large coilguns, MACs are capable of firing a variety of ammunition types varying on the model and bore, ranging from hyper-dense kinetic kill slugs to sub-caliubar rounds to semi-autonomous drone missiles. Most predominantly featured in Halo Wars and Halo Wars 2, the MAC is an ability that allows the player to utilize the UNSC Spirit of Fire's point-defense MAC for pinpoint orbital bombardment, allowing the player to heavily damage or destroy enemy units.

Catholicism The Catholic Church teaches that, \\"at the end of time, the Kingdom of God will come in its fullness. After the universal judgment, the righteous will reign for ever with Christ, glorified in body and soul. the universe itself will be renewed. [...] The visible universe, then, is itself destined to be transformed, 'so that the world itself, restored to its original state, facing no further obstacles, should be at the service of the just',\\" sharing their glorification in the risen Jesus Christ.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1042, 1047 The act of canonization, which in the Catholic Church is not normally called glorification, since in the theological sense it is God, not the Church, who glorifies, is reserved, both in the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches, to the Apostolic See and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the candidate for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that he is worthy to be recognized as a saint. The Church's official recognition of sanctity implies that the person is now in Heaven and may be publicly invoked. Canonization is a decree that the name of the saint be inscribed in the Roman Martyrology and that veneration be given to the saint universally within the Church. Veneration within the liturgy is regulated by the norms of the individual liturgical rite. On most weekdays of the year, if no solemnity, feast or obligatory memorial is assigned to that day, the Roman Rite allows celebration of the Mass of any Saint inscribed in the Martyrology for that day.General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 355 Beatification is a decree permitting public veneration in a limited geographical area or within certain communities, such as a religious institute.\\"Beatification, in the present discipline, differs from canonization in this: that the former implies (1) a locally restricted, not a universal, permission to venerate, which is (2) a mere permission, and no precept; while canonization implies a universal precept\\" (Beccari, Camillo. \\"Beatification and Canonization\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. Accessed 27 May 2009.). Eastern Orthodox Church Tsar Alexis of Russia (reigned 1645-1676) praying before the relics of Metropolitan Philip of Moscow (in office 1566-1568) St. John (Maximovitch) at the time of his glorification in San Francisco in 1994 The Eastern Orthodox Church, as, for instance, the Orthodox Church in America, uses the term \\"glorification\\" to refer to the official recognition of a person as a saint of the Church.\\"The Glorification of Saints in the Orthodox Church\\" by Fr. Joseph Frawley The Russian Orthodox Church uses both –∫–∞–Ω–æ–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è \\"canonization\\" and –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ \\"glorification.\\" Oriental Orthodox Church The Oriental Orthodox Churches also hold a doctrinal tradition similar to the Eastern Orthodox Churches whereby martyrs are not in need of any formal glorification. With time, the greatness of their sanctity which is venerated by the faithful is recognized by the Church. In the words of Armenian Patriarch H. H. Karekin II, This is in conformity with the tradition of other Churches in the Oriental Orthodox family such as Coptic Orthodox Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Indian Orthodox Church. The instances of glorification of the 21 Coptic martyrs in 2015 or the victims of Armenian genocide of 1915 simply serve as official recognition given by the hierarchs to the steadfast faith of those who laid down their lives in defense of their Christian identity. Reformed Churches There are two events that occur during glorification, these are \\"the receiving of perfection by the elect before entering into the kingdom of heaven,\\" and \\"the receiving of the resurrection bodies by the elect\\". Glorification is the third stage of Christian development. The first being justification, then sanctification, and finally glorification. (Rom. 8:28-30) Glorification is the completion, the consummation, the perfection, and the full realization of salvation. =Receiving of perfection= Glorification is the means by which the elect are delivered from their sins before entering into the kingdom of Heaven. According to Reformed Christians, glorification is a continuous, flowing process, whereby believers in Jesus the Christ, who have either died or who are raptured alive (called up into heaven), receive glorified, perfect bodies and souls, sinless and Christlike. It is not a painful process. Jerry L. Walls and James B. Gould have likened that process to the core or sanctification view of purgatory.James B. Gould, Practicing Prayer for the Dead: Its Theological Meaning and Spiritual Value (Wipf and Stock 2016), pp. 73‚àí76 \\"Grace is much more than forgiveness, it is also transformation and sanctification, and finally, glorification. We need more than forgiveness and justification to purge our sinful dispositions and make us fully ready for heaven. Purgatory is nothing more than the continuation of the sanctifying grace we need, for as long as necessary to complete the job\\".Jerry L. Walls, Purgatory: The Logic of Total Transformation (Oxford University Press 2012), p. 174; cf. Jerry L. Walls, Heaven: The Logic of Eternal Joy (Oxford University Press 2002), pp. 53‚àí62 and Jerry L. Walls, \\"Purgatory for Everyone\\" Glorification is the Reformed alternative to purgatory. According to the theologies of most major Protestant groups, purgatory is a doctrine of the Catholic Church, a holding place for those whose lives were dominated by venial sins but not guilty of mortal sins. =Receiving of the resurrection bodies= After the final judgement, all the righteous dead shall arise and their bodies will be perfected and will become a glorified body. Only then can they enter heaven. To paraphrase C. S. Lewis's Weight of Glory: \\"If we were to see them in their glorified forms we would be tempted to bow down and worship them.\\" References External links ;Protestantism * http://www.abideinchrist.com/keys/sanctification-perfect.html * http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/books/wws/salv17.htm Category:Christian terminology Category:Posthumous recognitions Category:Christian behaviour and experience Category:Christian saints it:Glorificazione ","title":"Glorification"},{"id":"2999776","text":"Antonio Warren (born November 25, 1975, in San Francisco, California) is a former Canadian Football League running back who played with the BC Lions and the Calgary Stampeders and Edmonton Eskimos.

It was dedicated to President Abraham Lincoln in 1909 and includes about of the northwestern corner of the San Francisco Peninsula. Western terminus of the Lincoln Highway-San Francisco Lincoln Park is the western terminus of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across the United States of America. The land on which Lincoln Park stands was a cemetery in use in the late 1860s and possibly earlier. In 1902, golf enthusiasts laid out a three-hole course on part of the land. In 1909, the Board of Supervisors turned the land over to the Parks Commission, and cemetery relocation began. The golf course expanded to 14 holes by 1914, then to a full 18 holes in 1917. During this period of development some of the original tract were turned over to the federal government to be added to the neighboring Fort Miley Military Reservation. The Lincoln Highway, with its western terminus at Lincoln Park, was conceived and mapped in 1913 as the first coast-to-coast road across America, traversing 14 states. The original western terminus marker of the highway was located at the north end of the plaza and fountain in front of the Legion of Honor. Today, a replica of the western terminus marker and an interpretive plaque are located at the southwest corner of the plaza, next to the bus stop. The replica marker was placed in 2002 during the revitalized Lincoln Highway Association's 10th Annual National Convention by the Association's California Chapter. In 1923, the park was chosen as the site of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. The San Francisco Holocaust Memorial, designed by George Segal, was dedicated in the park in 1984.

Owing to its physiological function in food absorption, the mucosal surface is thin and acts as a permeable barrier to the interior of the body. Equally, its fragility and permeability creates vulnerability to infection and, in fact, the vast majority of the infectious agents invading the human body use this route. The functional importance of GALT in body's defense relies on its large population of plasma cells, which are antibody producers, whose number exceeds the number of plasma cells in spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow combined.  Structure  The gut- associated lymphoid tissue lies throughout the intestine, covering an area of approximately 260‚Äì300 m2. In order to increase the surface area for absorption, the intestinal mucosa is made up of finger-like projections (villi), covered by a monolayer of epithelial cells, which separates the GALT from the lumen intestine and its contents. These epithelial cells are covered by a layer of glycocalyx on their luminal surface so as to protect cells from the acid pH. New epithelial cells derived from stem cells are constantly produced on the bottom of the intestinal glands, regenerating the epithelium (epithelial cell turnover time is less than one week). Although in these crypts conventional enterocytes are the dominant type of cells, Paneth cells can also be found. These are located at the bottom of the crypts and release a number of antibacterial substances, among them lysozyme, and are thought to be involved in the control of infections. Underneath them, there is an underlying layer of loose connective tissue called lamina propria. There is also lymphatic circulation through the tissue connected to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Both GALT and mesenteric lymph nodes are sites where the immune response is started due to the presence of immune cells through the epithelial cells and the lamina propria. The GALT also includes the Peyer's patches of the small intestine, isolated lymphoid follicles present throughout the intestine and the appendix in humans. The following comprise lymphoid tissue in the gut: *Waldeyer's tonsillar ring *Peyer's patches *Lymphoid aggregates in the appendix and large intestine *Lymphoid tissue accumulating with age in the stomach *Small lymphoid aggregates in the esophagus *Diffusely distributed lymphoid cells and plasma cells in the lamina propria of the gut = Peyer's patches = The Peyer's patch is an aggregate of lymphoid cells projected to the lumen of the gut which acts as a very important site for the initiation of the immune response. It forms a subepithelial dome where large number of B cell follicles with its germinal centers, T cells areas between them in a smaller number and dendritic cells are found. In this area, the subepithelial dome is separated from the intestinal lumen by a layer of follicle-associated epithelium. This contains conventional intestinal epithelial cells and a small number of specialized epithelial cells called microfold cells (M cells) in between. Unlike enterocytes, these M cells present a folded luminal surface instead of the microvilli, do not secrete digestive enzymes or mucus and lack a thick surface of glycocalix. Function The digestive tract is an important component of the body's immune system. In fact, the intestine possesses the largest mass of lymphoid tissue in the human body. The GALT is made up of several types of lymphoid tissue that store immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, that carry out attacks and defend against pathogens. New research indicates that GALT may continue to be a major site of HIV activity, even if drug treatment has reduced HIV count in the peripheral blood.Moraima Guadalupe,1 Sumathi Sankaran,1 Michael D. George,1 Elizabeth Reay,1 David Verhoeven,1 Barbara L. Shacklett,1 Jason Flamm,4 Jacob Wegelin,3 Thomas Prindiville,2 and Satya Dandekar.

Multiple measures of HIV burden in blood and tissue are correlated with each other but not with clinical parameters in aviremic subjects. AIDS. 2003 Jan 3;17(1):53-63. Other animals The adaptive immunity, mediated by antibodies and T cells, is only found in vertebrates. Whereas all of them have a gut-associated lymphoid tissue and the vast majority have a version of spleen and thymus, not all vertebrates show bone marrow, lymph nodes or germinal centers, what means that not all vertebrates can generate lymphocytes in bone marrow. This different distribution of the adaptive organs in the different groups of vertebrates suggests GALT as the very first part of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. It has been suggested that from this existing GALT, and due to the pressure put by commensal bacteria in gut that coevolved with vertebrates, later specializations as thymus, spleen or lymph nodes appeared as part of the adaptive immune system.

As the daughter of novelists Harry Mazer and Norma Fox Mazer, Mazer loved books and said that she would often sneak out of high school to go to the public library. After high school, she went on to study art, at Syracuse University's School of Visual and Performing Arts. She also studied French language and literature at the Sorbonne in Paris, where she lived for three years. It was in Paris that Mazer began writing, but she didn't consider the picture book form until after the first of her two children was born. Watch Me, her first published work, became one of a number of critically acclaimed picture books; Moose Street, published two years later, was the first of Mazer's young adult novels. The Salamander Room was a 1993 ABC Children's Choice book and a Reading Rainbow Feature selection. Among her seven novels, Moose Street was a Booklist Editor's Choice for Best Book of 1992, and The Oxboy was a Notable 1993 Children's Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies and an ALA Notable Book. Mazer's short stories have been included in anthologies, and she has edited four anthologies for teenage readers, several of which have been named New York Public Library Best Books for Teens.

It has long been favoured by journalists and media personnel. The hotel overlooks the Tigris on its eastern bank and is located several hundred metres south of the Baghdad Hotel.  History  The hotel was built in 1982 by the Iraqi government and managed by the French hotelier Le M√©ridien as the Palestine Meridien Hotel.Martin, Susan Taylor. \\"In Baghdad, lap of luxury isn't all that comfortable.\\" St. Petersburg Times, April 26, 2003. UN-imposed sanctions following the Gulf War led Le M√©ridien to dissociate itself from the hotel, which was subsequently renamed simply the Palestine Hotel. Starting with the 1991 Gulf War and continuing through the 2003 invasion of Iraq, this was one of several hotels foreign media used to cover situations that developed in Iraq. = April 8, 2003 incident = A controversial incident occurred during the 2003 invasion of Baghdad. On April 8, 2003, an American tank fired a shell on the hotel, killing two journalists, Reuters cameraman Taras Protsyuk and Jos√© Couso of Telecinco Spanish television. Three journalists were wounded. One of the survivor journalists was Japanese Mika Yamamoto who died in Aleppo during the Syrian civil war on August 20, 2012. On May 27, 2003, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published a report of their investigation into the tank shelling of the Palestine Hotel on April 8, 2003. After interviewing \\"about a dozen reporters who were at the scene, including two embedded journalists who monitored the military radio traffic before and after the shelling occurred\\" the CPJ determined that the facts suggest that the \\"attack on the journalists, while not deliberate, was avoidable\\". The CPJ determined that the tank thought it was firing upon an Iraqi forward artillery observer when it hit the hotel. The report went on to say \\"CPJ has learned that Pentagon officials, as well as commanders on the ground in Baghdad, knew that the Palestine Hotel was full of international journalists and were intent on not hitting it.\\"CPJ Report A U.S. military investigation in August 2003 cleared Philip DeCamp and the other two soldiers concerned, Sgt. Shawn Gibson and Capt. Philip Wolford, of wrongdoing, saying they acted properly because they believed they were firing on enemy troops. According to the inquiry, American commanders reacted to the tank's firing on the building immediately with anger and consternation, with Lieutenant Colonel DeCamp, the battalion commander, berating Captain Wolford, his subordinate, for giving Sergeant Gibson clearance to fire. However the inquiry never clarified why he or anybody else were unable to prevent the attack from taking place. A few days after the April incident, DeCamp was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying \\"I'm sorry to say it, but I'm the guy who killed the journalists. I'm really sorry, and I feel badly for their families, but I had no choice. My soldiers' lives were in danger.\\"\\"Colonel apologizes for journalists' deaths, defends actions\\" David Zucchino, Los Angeles Times, April 11, 2003 In February 2004, the NGO Reporters Without Borders, after undertaking their own investigation, called for the reopening of the inquiry into the incident of 8 April 2003. The NGO stated that the soldiers on the ground, including Philip Wolford, Philip DeCamp and Shawn Gibson, could probably not be held responsible for their lack of information about the function of the Palestine Hotel. Reporters Without Borders however demanded that the responsibility of higher commanding levels be investigated, as they withheld the crucial information from their lower ranking officers that the Palestine Hotel was used by journalists.RSF investigates US military strike on Baghdad's Palestine Hotel In 2008, former military intelligence linguist Army Sergeant Adrienne Kinne revealed to DemocracyNow.org that she had seen secret US military documents that listed the Hotel Palestine as a potential target.Fmr.

He was president of the trustees of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, co-founder of the American Baptist Educational Society, and co-founder of the Layman's Missionary Movement. Life On September 12, 1845, Joshua Levering was born in Baltimore, Maryland to Eugene Levering and Ann S. Levering along with his identical twin brother Eugene Levering. In 1872, he married Martha W. Keyser and had seven children with her before her death in 1888 and later married her sister Margaret S. Keyser in 1892 until her death in 1895. In 1901, he married Helen Woods who would outlive him. From 1881 to 1903, he was the superintendent of the Sunday school of Eutaw Place Church. In 1867, he served as a delegate to the Southern Baptist Convention. In 1884, he joined the Prohibition Party and was the party's candidate for comptroller in 1891 and governor in 1895. In 1887 and in 1893, he was chairman of the Maryland Prohibition party's state convention and served as a delegate to the 1888 and 1892 national conventions. On July 1, 1892, he was narrowly defeated by James B. Cranfill for the Prohibition Party's vice presidential nomination with 416 delegates to 332 delegates after a story circulated that Levering was a member of the coffee industry. On May 29, 1896, Levering became the presidential candidate of the Prohibition Party by acclamation for the presidential election; he was a narrow gauger who supported a platform with one plank for prohibition unlike the broad gaugers who supported free silver and women's suffrage being added to the platform. He and his running mate Hale Johnson received 131,312 votes while the broad gauger presidential ticket of Charles Eugene Bentley and James H. Southgate received 13,968 votes. In 1885, he was elected as the president of the local branch of the YMCA until his retirement on January 8, 1901. In 1903, 1904, 1906, and 1907, he and members of his family traveled throughout the world to observe missionaries in Japan and China. In 1925 he served as a delegate to the Southern Baptist Convention again. On October 6, 1935 he died in Baltimore at age 90.

Game theory overview A variety of forms of truels have been studied in game theory. Features that determine the nature of a truel include * the probability of each player hitting their chosen targets (often not assumed to be the same for each player) * whether the players shoot simultaneously or sequentially, and, if sequentially, whether the shooting order is predetermined, or determined at random from among the survivors; * the number of bullets each player has (in particular, whether this is finite or infinite); * whether or not intentionally missing is allowed. There is usually a general assumption that each player in the truel wants to be the only survivor, and will behave logically in a manner that maximizes the probability of this. (If each player only wishes to survive and does not mind if the others also survive, then the rational strategy for all three players can be to miss every time.) In the widely studied form, the three have different probabilities of hitting their target. If a single bullet is used, the probabilities of hitting the target are equal and deliberate missing is allowed, the best strategy for the first shooter is to deliberately miss. Since he is now disarmed, the next shooter will have no reason to shoot the first one and so will shoot at the third shooter. While the second shooter might miss deliberately, there would then be the risk that the third one would shoot him. If the first shooter does not deliberately miss, he will presumably be shot by whichever shooter remained. If an unlimited number of bullets are used, then deliberate missing may be the best strategy for a duelist with lower accuracy than both opponents. If both have better than 50% success rate, he should continue to miss until one of his opponents kills the other. Then he will get the first shot at the remaining opponent. But if the \\"middle\\" opponent is weak, it can be better to team up with him until the strongest is eliminated. The details depend on the firing order. For example, if the order is P, Q, R, with respective probabilities :p > q > r\\\\, and it is R's turn, R should waste his shot if: :p < \\\\frac{q (1 + q)}{1 - q + q^2} but not do so if: :(1 - q)(1 - q + q^2)p^2 - q(1 - q)(1 + 2q)p - q^3 > 0\\\\, In between, R should waste his shot if: :r > \\\\frac{p(p - q - pq - q^2 + pq^2)}{p^2(1 - q) + q^2(1 - p)^2} History Frederick Marryat describes a three-way duel in his novel Mr. Midshipman Easy, published in 1836 (see chapter 17 (Wikisource link)). This duel is more of a circular affair, with the first participant aiming only for the second, the second participant aiming only for the third, and the third participant aiming only at the first. A later mention of three-person \\"duels\\" is A. P. Herbert's play Fat King Melon (1927). An extensive bibliography has been compiled by D. Marc Kilgour. The word \\"truel\\" was introduced in Martin Shubik's 1964 book Game Theory and Related Approaches to Social Behavior, page 43, and independently in Richard Epstein's 1967 book Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic, page 343. In popular culture In one of the most famous spaghetti westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, the final showdown is played out to be a climactic truel among the three main characters: Blondie (\\"The Good\\"), Angel Eyes (\\"The Bad\\"), and Tuco (\\"The Ugly\\"). The standoff remains a signature piece for director Sergio Leone and one of the best-known scenes in film history. The climactic ending to the 1987 film City on Fire features a truel which is interrupted by the arrival of police. The 1992 film Reservoir Dogs has a very similar confrontation among the characters Mr. White, Nice Guy Eddie, and Joe Cabot, in which only one survives. The truel is also parodied at the climax of the film The Good, the Bad, the Weird. A truel with swords is fought among Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and James Norrington in the 2006 film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest; all three characters survive. The short film Truel explores the idea of a three-way duel.Truel In the novel and movie A Dog's Will, a truel is one of Jo√£o Grilo's plans. In an episode of the hit show The Office, Michael convinces everyone to play a board game similar to Clue. The episode ends with Michael, Andy, and Dwight in a finger truel.

After the war, the universities moved back and resumed their operation. What was left behind in Kunming became the National Kunming Normal University which later emerged as the Yunnan Normal University.  History  Commemorative stone of the university By summer 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army had bombed Nankai University to the ground in Tianjin and occupied areas including the campuses of two of the country's leading universities in Beijing: Peking University and Tsinghua University. These three universities, which were some of the country's most prestigious, modern institutions of higher learning and research, with the agreement of those who led the institutions ‚Äî men of high standing who had been educated abroad ‚Äî retreated to Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province (about 900 miles away from Beijing) to unite. By the middle of December 1937, many students had to leave to fight the Japanese when the city of Nanjing fell to enemy forces. As the Japanese forces were gaining more territory, they bombed Changsha in February 1938. The 800 staff faculty and students who were left had to flee and made the 1,000 mile journey to Kunming, capital of Yunnan province in China's remote and mountainous southwest. It was here that the National Southwest Associated University (commonly known as 'Lianda') was formed. In these extraordinary wartime circumstances for eight years, staff, professors and students had to survive and operate in makeshift quarters that were subjected to sporadic bombing campaigns by the Imperial Japanese forces. There were dire shortages of food, equipment, books, clothing and other essential needs, but they managed to conduct the running of a modern university. Over those years of war (1937-1945), Lianda became famous nationwide for having and producing many of China's most prominent scientists and intellectuals, including the Nobel Prize laureates Yang Chen-Ning and Tsung-Dao Lee. = Aftermath = When the war ended with victory over the Japanese, the Lianda community, which had entered the war fiercely loyal to the government of Chiang Kai-shek, emerged in 1946 as a bastion of criticism of China‚Äôs ruling Kuomintang party. Within three years, the majority of the Lianda community had returned to their north China campuses in Beijing and Tianjin.

He played for the San Diego Rockets, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the San Diego Clippers. College career Smith played for the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. It was there where he got his nickname of Bingo to differentiate from the other two Bobby Smiths on the team. Playing career With the sixth pick in the first round of the 1969 NBA draft, the San Diego Rockets selected Smith. A year later, he was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 1970 Expansion Draft. In his first game with the team, he scored 21 points. He helped contribute to the Cavaliers winning the NBA Central Division title in 1975, and was part of the Miracle of Richfield, winning Game 2 of the Semifinals vs the Washington Bullets. In 11 seasons, Smith played in 865 games and logged 22,407 minutes. Smith was especially noted for his ability to hit jump shots from long range. His outside jump shots, often were taken from today's 3 point range. For his career, he recorded a .449 field goal percentage (4,776 FGs made out of 10,642 attempts). Smith also had a .798 free throw rate (1,307-of-1,637) and also accounted for 3,630 total rebounds, 1,734 assists and 10,882 points. Smith was known for his rainbow jumper, now utilized by other forwards such as Dirk Nowitzki. His best season was in 1974, when he scored 15.9 points per game and had a .483 field goal percentage. He played the full 82 games in four of his seasons, but he also led the league in turnovers percentage in his final three seasons. He scored his 10,000th point in the middle of the 1979 season. On October 27, 1979, he was traded for a 3rd round draft pick (used to pick Stuart House) to the San Diego Clippers. Oddly enough, the Cavaliers retired his number over a month later, while he was still playing with the Clippers. Fittingly, he ended his career in the same place it had started. After one season (the first year that the three point line was instituted), he was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks in 1980 Expansion Draft, but he never played for them, retiring at the age of 34. Smith was inducted into the University of Tulsa Athletics Hall of Fame in 1984. His number 7 has been retired by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He is third all time in games played with the Cavaliers, fifth in minutes played, sixth in points, third in field goal and field goal attempts, and third in turnover percentage. On April 1, 2009, Smith suffered a stroke, which he is still recovering from. He is divorced, and has five children, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He is a member of the 2016 class of the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2020, Tulsa retired Smith‚Äôs number 32.

The network mainly airs classic television sitcoms and drama series from the 1950s through the 1980s, although it also includes more recent programs from the 1990s and 2000s. Through its ownership by Luken, Retro is a sister network to several broadcast network properties that are wholly or jointly owned by the company, including the family-oriented Family Channel and country music-oriented network Heartland. At its outset, Retro was designed to be broadcast on the digital subchannels of television stations; however in recent years, the network's affiliate body has been drawn down to primarily low-power stations, as many station groups have replaced the network on the subchannels of their full-power major network affiliates with similarly formatted networks such as Antenna TV and MeTV, which have assumed rights to many of the distributors that formerly held programming agreements with Retro. The network is also available nationwide on free-to-air C-band satellite via SES-2 in DVB-S2 format;SES-2 at 87.0¬∞W, LyngSat Free TV from United States, LyngSat as individualized transmitter-ready feeds for each station are centrally generated using broadcast automation and delivered to the stations by satellite. In March 2020, Retro launched a live online feed, which carries a limited six-hour selection of the network's programming, looped four times each day.https://www.watchretrotv.com/schedules History Retro Television Network logo used from July 2005 to June 2009. The Retro Television Network (originally branded as \\"RTN\\") launched in July 2005 on select television stations owned by the Equity Broadcasting Corporation (later known as Equity Media Holdings), a chain of small (often low-powered) satellite-fed UHF television stations controlled directly from Equity's headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas. Equity had expanded quickly with purchases of many small stations in the early 2000s, but by 2008, the company was struggling to meet its obligations. In June 2008, while the company was undergoing financial troubles, Equity Media Holdings sold RTN to Henry Luken III's ‚Äì Equity's former president and CEO, and the company's largest shareholder ‚Äì Luken Communications (which later rebranded as Reach High Media Group in 2019) for $18.5 million in cash. Equity had an option to repurchase the network for $27.75 million; the purchase option was not exercised and expired on December 24, 2008. Equity had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy three weeks before the expiration of the purchase option.Arkansas Business: \\"Creditor Files to Liquidate Equity Media, Claims Company Cannot Meet Payroll Obligations\\", 12/10/2008. On January 4, 2009, a contract conflict between Equity and Luken Communications interrupted RTN programming on many of its affiliates with Luken alleging that Equity had left many obligations to RTN's creditors, including programming suppliers, unpaid. As a result, Luken restored a national feed of the network from its Chattanooga headquarters with individual feeds to affiliates not owned by Equity following suit on a piecemeal basis. Equity-owned or -operated stations lost RTN affiliation, though Luken vowed to find new affiliates for the network in the affected areas. RTV logo used from June 2009 to March 2013. The Retro Television Network changed its on-air branding to \\"RTV\\" in June 2009 (a nod to the digital television transition that occurred that month, though a trademark dispute with the Racetrack Television Network was also a factor in the change).\\"RTN Rebrands as RTV\\", from broadcastingcable.com 6/17/2009 In 2012, RTV dropped from 120 to 80 affiliates with many ABC affiliates switching to the Live Well Network. Further affiliate drops occurred as RTV's scheduling began to decline with lesser product, with MeTV and Antenna TV (both with strong corporate backing and financing, along with more generous affiliation terms than Luken) making major carriage deals with large broadcast groups. In March 2017, the final \\"major\\" group carrying the network, Sinclair Broadcast Group, dropped the network from three remaining Sinclair stations where RTV affiliation agreements were made with their former owners, replacing it with their in- house network TBD. On October 1, 2017, the network lost its last station with one of the \\"Big Five\\" networks, WKTC in Columbia, South Carolina, which replaced its subchannel with Laff. The network was re-branded as Retro TV in 2013. Of the top 25 digital broadcast networks for 2014, Retro TV ranked No. 10 with a coverage of 54% of households. Concept and programming Since its creation, Retro's principal programming concept consists of classic television series, initially maintaining a 24-hour schedule of shows. As of 2019, the on- air lineup dates mostly from the 1950s to the 1970s, with the exception of prime time, which consists mostly of contemporary programming from Canada. Retro airs a full block of Saturday morning cartoon reruns and family-friendly adventure series and comedies on Saturdays; the network uses Sunday mornings to meet E/I liabilities, largely with programming widely available elsewhere. There have been some deviations to the format, including during the network's ownership under Equity, which added some original talk programming (notably Unreliable Sources) during the late night slot on weeknights from the summer of 2008 to early 2009, a concept billed as \\"Classic Hits All Day & Fresh Talk All Night\\". Overnights also eventually became devoted to paid programming.\\"Back from Basic,\\" from BusinessTN, September/October 2009 The network has also featured originally produced horror film showcases such as Wolfman Mac's Chiller Drive-In\\"Wolfman Mac interview\\", from Outsight Radio Hours, 3/27/2011 and Off Beat Cinema; Retro also aired the talk show Daytime produced by WFLA-TV's Riverbank Studios in Tampa, Florida, co-hosted by Jerry Penacoli and Cyndi Edwards. Until 2011, Retro offered a customized schedule for use at the discretion of the local affiliate. The network then moved towards a set national schedule, although affiliates have the option to pre- empt or reschedule some network programming.RTV Changes Schedule, Loses Universal By June 2011, when Retro's distribution agreement with NBCUniversal Television Distribution ended, the network adjusted its schedule to feature programming from other distributors (such as I Spy and Starsky and Hutch) and public domain programs (such as early episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies), as well as low-cost Canadian barter programs (such as Cold Squad and Da Vinci's Inquest) and reality and documentary programming (including Crusade in Europe based on Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's memoirs of World War II and Crusade in the Pacific). Retro also featured a Saturday morning block of vintage cartoon programming.\\"RTV Bringing Back Retro Saturday Morning TV\\", from TVNewsCheck, 8/5/2010 In 2014, Retro began broadcasting Mystery Science Theater 3000, the soap opera The Doctors, and the classic era of long-running British science fiction television show Doctor Who; MST3K departed the schedule upon the rights being purchased by Sinclair Broadcast Group's Comet. The network previously had major content deals with CBS Television Distribution until July 2008,Creditor Files to Liquidate Equity Media, Claims Company Cannot Meet Payroll Obligations and NBCUniversal Television Distribution (whose programming agreement began after the deal with CBS ended) until June 2011. Retro's current programming roster draws from various distributors including BBC Studios Distribution, Genesis International, Shout! Factory, Peter Rodgers Organization, CBC Television, and SFM Entertainment, as well as John DiSciullo (the distributor of Off Beat Cinema); compared to its competition, public domain series continue to compose a large portion of the schedule. Affiliates As of March 2017, Retro TV is carried on 97 affiliates and translators across the United States, covering 60% of the country's DMA households. Prior to the 2009 digital transition, Retro was seen on a number of analog stations owned by Equity Media Holdings, the network's former owner. Some Equity stations mixed Retro programming with first-run and recent off- network syndicated programming or also carried another network, such as MyNetworkTV or Ion Television.

It involves opposition to organized religion, religious practices or religious institutions. The term antireligion has also been used to describe opposition to specific forms of supernatural worship or practice, whether organized or not. Opposition to religion also goes beyond the misotheistic spectrum. As such, antireligion is distinct from deity-specific positions such as atheism (the lack of belief in deities) and antitheism (an opposition to belief in deities); although \\"antireligionists\\" may also be atheists or antitheists.  History  An early form of mass antireligion was expressed during the Enlightenment, as early as the 17th century. Baron d'Holbach's book Christianity Unveiled published in 1761, attacked not only Christianity but religion in general as an impediment to the moral advancement of humanity. According to historian Michael Burleigh, antireligion found its first mass expression of barbarity in revolutionary France as \\"organised ... irreligion...an 'anti-clerical' and self-styled 'non- religious' state\\" responded violently to religious influence over society.Michael Burleigh Earthly Powers p 96-97 State atheism The Soviet Union adopted the political ideology of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. It officially adopted the policy of state atheism.: \\"The Soviet policy of state atheism (gosateizm), albeit inconsistently applied, remains a major goal of official ideology. Massive state resources have been expended not only to prevent the implanting of religious belief in nonbelievers but also to eradicate \\"prerevolutionary remnants\\" already existing. The regime is not merely passively committed to a godless polity but takes an aggressive stance of official forced atheization. Thus a major task of the police apparatus is the persecution of forms of religious practice. Not surprisingly, the Committee for State Security (KGB) is reported to have a division dealing specifically with \\"churchmen and sectarians.\\" It directed varying degrees of antireligious efforts at varying faiths, depending on what threat they posed to the Soviet state, and their willingness to subordinate itself to political authority. These antireligious campaigns were directed at all faiths,http://www.countrystudies.us/russia/38.htm including Christian, Islamic, Buddhist, Jewish, and Shamanist religions. In the 1930s, during the Stalinist period, the government destroyed church buildings or put them into secular use (as museums of religion and atheism, clubs or storage facilities), executed clergy, prohibited the publication of most religious material and persecuted some members of religious groups. Less violent attempts to reduce or eliminate the influence of religion in society were also carried out at other times in Soviet history. For instance, it was usually necessary to be an atheist in order to acquire any important political position or any prestigious scientific job; thus many people became atheists in order to advance their careers. In the years of 1921‚Äì1950, some estimate that 15 million Christians were killed in the Soviet Union.World Christian trends, AD 30-AD 2200, p.243 Table 4-10 By David B. Barrett, Todd M.

The People's Republic of Albania had an objective for the eventual elimination of all religion in Albania with the goal of creating an atheist nation, which it declared it had achieved in 1967. In 1976, Albania implemented a constitutional ban on religious activity and propaganda.http://countrystudies.us/albania/56.htm The government nationalised most property of religious institutions and used it for non-religious purposes, such as cultural centers for young people. Religious literature was banned. Many clergy and theists were tried, tortured, and executed. All foreign Roman Catholic clergy were expelled in 1946.World Christian trends, AD 30-AD 2200, p.230-246 Tables 4-10 By David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, Christopher R. Guidry, Peter F. Crossing Albania was the only country that ever officially banned religion. Authorities in the People's Republic of Romania aimed to move towards an atheistic society, in which religion would be considered as the ideology of the bourgeoisie; the r√©gime also set to propagate among the laboring masses in science, politics and culture to help them fight superstition and mysticism, and initiated an anti- religious campaign aimed at reducing the influence of religion in society.

Description The largest of the gerbils, great gerbils have a head and body length of . Their skulls are distinctive by having two grooves in each incisor. They have large front claws used for burrowing. Taxonomy Largely ignored in Western taxonomies of rodents, the great gerbil was recognized as a species separate from the common gerbil in the 1960s, after the work of the American zoologist Sarah Cheeseman, primarily because of their ability to host and transmit different bacteria and viruses. Distribution and habitat Great gerbils are found in arid habitats, predominantly in sandy or clay deserts. They are found in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. Ecology and behavior Great gerbils live in family groups and occupy one burrow per family. Their burrows can be fairly extensive with separate chambers for nests and food storage. Great gerbils spend considerably more time in the burrows during winter, but do not hibernate. They are predominantly diurnal. Food consists mostly of vegetable matter. The animals are often colonial. Longevity is 2‚Äì4 years. Burrow system complexes have a distinctive region of cleared soil and can be seen and mapped from aerial photos and satellite images. Inhabited great gerbil burrows can be distinguished from abandoned burrows using satellite images . Great gerbils are known reservoirs of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, and of Leishmania major, the causative agent of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis. They are also known as crop pests and have been implicated in exacerbating erosion.

New equity increases the total shares outstanding which has a dilutive effect on the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. This increase in the number of shares outstanding can result from a primary market offering (including an initial public offering), employees exercising stock options, or by issuance or conversion of convertible bonds, preferred shares or warrants into stock. This dilution can shift fundamental positions of the stock such as ownership percentage, voting control, earnings per share, and the value of individual shares. Control dilution Control dilution describes the reduction in ownership percentage or loss of a controlling share of an investment's stock. Many venture capital contracts contain an anti- dilution provision in favor of the original investors, to protect their equity investments. One way to raise new equity without diluting voting control is to give warrants to all the existing shareholders equally. They can choose to put more money in the company, or else lose ownership percentage. When employee options threaten to dilute the ownership of a control group, the company can use cash to buy back the shares issued. The measurement of this percent dilution is made at a point in time. It will change as market values change and cannot be interpreted as a \\"measure of the impact of\\" dilutions. #Presume that all convertible securities are convertible at the date. #Add up the number of new shares that will be issued as a result. #Add up the proceeds that would be received on these conversions and issues (The reduction of debt is a 'proceed'). #Divide the total proceeds by the current market price of the stock to determine the number of shares the proceeds can buyback. #Subtract the number bought-back from the new shares originally issued #Divide the net increase in shares by the starting # shares outstanding. Earnings dilution Earnings dilution describes the reduction in amount earned per share in an investment due to an increase in the total number of shares. The calculation of earnings dilutions derives from this same process as control dilution. The net increase in shares (steps 1-5) is determined at the beginning of the reporting period, and added to the beginning number of shares outstanding. The net income for the period is divided by this increased number of shares. Notice that the conversion rates are determined by market values at the beginning, not the period end. The returns to be realized on the reinvestment of the proceeds are not part of this calculation. Value dilution Value dilution describes the reduction in the current price of a stock due to the increase in the number of shares. This generally occurs when shares are issued in exchange for the purchase of a business, and incremental income from the new business must be at least the return on equity (ROE) of the old business. When the purchase price includes goodwill, this becomes a higher hurdle to clear. The theoretical diluted price, i.e. the price after an increase in the number of shares, can be calculated as: :Theoretical Diluted Price = \\\\frac{(O \\\\times OP) + (N \\\\times IP)}{O + N} Where: *O = original number of shares *OP = Current share price *N = number of new shares to be issued *IP = issue price of new shares For example, if there is a 3-for-10 issue, the current price is $0.50, the issue price $0.32, we have * O = 10, OP = $0.50, N = 3, IP = $0.32, and * TDP = ((10 √ó 0.50) + (3 √ó 0.32)) / (10 + 3) = $0.4585 =Owners' share of the underlying business= If the new shares are issued for proceeds at least equal to the pre-existing price of a share, then there is no negative dilution in the amount recoverable. The old owners just own a smaller piece of a bigger company. However, voting rights at stockholder meetings are decreased. But, if new shares are issued for proceeds below or equal to the pre-existing price of a share, then stock holders have the opportunity to maintain their current voting power without losing net worth. =Market value of the business= Frequently the market value for shares will be higher than the book value. Investors will not receive full value unless the proceeds equal the market value. When this shortfall is triggered by the exercise of employee stock options, it is a measure of wage expense. When new shares are issued at full value, the excess of the market value over the book value is a kind of internalized capital gain for the investor. He is in the same position as if he sold the same % interest in the secondary market. Assuming that markets are efficient, the market price of a stock will reflect these evaluations, but with the increase in shareholder equity 'management' and prevalence of barter transactions involving equity, this assumption may be stretched. Preferred share conversions are usually done on a dollar-for-dollar basis. $1,000 face value of preferreds will be exchanged for $1,000 worth of common shares (at market value). As the common shares increase in value, the preferreds will dilute them less (in terms of percent-ownership), and vice versa. In terms of value dilution, there will be none from the point of view of the shareholder. Since most shareholders are invested in the belief the stock price will increase, this is not a problem. When the stock price declines because of some bad news, the company's next report will have to measure, not only the financial results of the bad news, but also the increase in the dilution percentage. This exacerbates the problem and increases the downward pressure on the stock, increasing dilution. Some financing vehicles are structured to augment this process by redefining the conversion factor as the stock price declines, thus leading to a \\"death spiral\\". Impact of options and warrants dilution Options and warrants are converted at pre- defined rates. As the stock price increases, their value increases dollar-for- dollar. If the stock is valued at a stable price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) it can be predicted that the options' rate of increase in value will be 20 times (when P/E=20) the rate of increase in earnings. The calculation of \\"what percentage share of future earnings increases goes to the holders of options instead of shareholders?\\" is :(in-the-money options outstanding as % total) √ó (P/E ratio) = % future earnings accrue to option holders For example, if the options outstanding equals 5% of the issued shares and the P/E=20, then 95% (= 5/105*20) of any increase in earnings goes, not to the shareholders, but to the options holders. Share dilution scams A share dilution scam happens when a company, typically traded in unregulated markets such as the OTC Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets, repeatedly issues a massive number of shares into the market (using follow-on offerings) for no particular reason, considerably devaluing share prices until they become almost worthless, causing huge losses to shareholders. Then, after share prices are at or near the minimum price a stock can trade and the share float has increased to an unsustainable level, those fraudulent companies tend to reverse split and continue repeating the same scheme.  Investor-backed private companies and startups  Stock dilution has special relevance to investor-backed private companies and startups. Significantly dilutive events occur much more frequently for private companies than they do for public companies. These events happen because private companies frequently issue large amounts of new stock every time they raise money from investors. Private company investors often acquire large ownership stakes (20‚Äì35%) and invest large sums of money as part of the venture capital process. To accommodate this, private companies must issue large amounts of stock to these investors. The issuance of stock to new investors creates significant dilution for founders and existing shareholders. Company founders start with 100% ownership of their company but frequently have less than 35% ownership in the later-stages of their companies' life cycles (i.e., before a sale of the company or an IPO). While founders and investors both understand this dilution, managing it and minimizing it can often be the difference between a successful outcome for founders and a failure. As such, dilutive terms are heavily negotiated in venture capital deals.

Giles Campus French Immersion Public School was created in 2011 at the former W. D. Lowe High School building to accommodate French Immersion students in the Northwest area of Windsor. This was a temporary solution due to demand for French Immersion programming in the city until a business case was approved to build a new school within the area. In January 2017 the GECDSB purchased a piece of property at 1123 Mercer Street. The former International Playing Card factory, a designated heritage building, will be preserved and included in the overall design of the new school. The new school construction began in July 2020 with an opening anticipated for January 2022. =New North Shore= In November 2015 the Greater Essex County District School Board was awarded a grant of $15.3 million for the construction of a new dual-track French Immersion / English school in the North Shore area. This will replace the current D.M. Eagle Public School and serve an area in Tecumseh and Lakeshore. =New Kingsville JK-12= In April 2016, the Ministry of Education announced funding for a $44-million JK-to-Grade 12 school to be located in Kingsville. The new school will consolidate students from Kingsville District High School, Harrow District High School, Kingsville Public School, and Jack Miner Public School, and may be the most expensive school the province has ever built. =New Amherstburg High School= In October 2016 the Ministry of Education awarded a $24.3 million grant for the construction of a new Amherstburg High School, which will consolidate the General Amherst HS and Western SS communities. The site of the new school is located at the south end of Centennial Park off Simcoe Street between Fryer Street and Victoria Street South which was sold to the school board from the Town of Amherstburg in January 2018. =New Legacy Oak Trail Public School= In October 2016 the Ministry of Education awarded a grant of $9,180,832 to build a replacement for Prince Andrew Public School in LaSalle, Ontario.

The short was released on October 13, 1956 and features Elmer Fudd. The title is a pun on Red Skelton's famous \\"I Dood It\\" line from the Mean Widdle Kid routine. Yankee Dood It was the last of three cartoons to be underwritten by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which also underwrote By Word of Mouse and Heir-Conditioned.

This cartoon is also one of the few cartoons where the character Sylvester has no speaking lines (except for \\"Ah-ha!\\" and \\"Sufferin' Succotash\\"). Synopsis The cartoon short is based on the fairy tale The Elves and the Shoemaker, set 150 years after that story took place (in the first of the 19th century).If the cartoon was made in 1956 (or produced between 1954 and 1956), 150 years before that would be 1804-1806 Elmer Fudd is the progressive King of industrial Elves. He is doing roll call, only to discover that some of his elves are missing. His elf helper tells him that the elves are helping an outmoded shoemaker, but Elmer points out that it's the 20th century. He tells his elf helper to get the elves back or he'll mark them AWOL, just before telling the elf helper that if he is turned into a mouse, he must say \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\". At the shop, the elf helper tells the shoemaker that he must take the elves back, but the shoemaker wants to stay in business. Unfortunately, his pet cat, Sylvester, uses the magic word, \\"Jehoshaphat\\" to turn Elmer's elf helper into a mouse and chases him around the shoemaker's shop. Saying \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\" changes him back to an elf, much to the disgust of Sylvester, who puts the elf helper down. The shoemaker puts Sylvester up so that he cannot interfere. Elmer comes to the shop and explains the role of capitalism and mass production to the shoemaker, who then agrees to use this knowledge to stay in business; he advises the shoemaker to invest his profits back into the business instead of pocketing them for himself. (At the time, marginal income taxes in the United States were over 90% for those in the highest income tax bracket, strongly discouraging business owners from pocketing their profits.) Four months later, the shoemaker's little shop has literally become a shoe factory. Elmer comes back to see how the shoemaker was \\"pwogwessing,\\" and the shoemaker says that he has gotten over 500 employees and next month his business will be expanding. This reminds him to come up with a name for his new boot line up, and he comes up with the new name: \\"Jehoshaphat Boots!\\" This turns Elmer into a mouse, who forgets that \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\" is the magic word, and runs as Sylvester decides to chase him out of the factory and into the distance just as the cartoon ends with Elmer finally saying \\"Wumpewstiwtskin!\\" References External links *Tim Cavanaugh, Reason Magazine - Elfinomics Discussion of economic content of cartoon * Category:1956 animated films Category:1950s American animated films Category:American films Category:Films based on Grimms' Fairy Tales Category:Films scored by Milt Franklyn Category:Short films directed by Friz Freleng Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Alfred P.

Visigothic art, the art of the Visigoths to 711, is usually classified as Migration Period art by art historians to emphasis its Germanic connections and origins; but can also classified as Pre-Romanesque, particularly in Spain, to emphasis its lineage in Spanish history. Styles The main styles (based on chronological and geographic considerations) of the Iberian Pre-Romanesque were: *Visigothic art and architecture *Asturian art, the art of the Kingdom of Asturias from 718 through the 10th century *Mozarabic art, art of mixed Arab-Spanish heritage made by the Mozarabs, the Christians under the Islamic rule. *Repoblaci√≥n art and architecture (Spanish, arte de repoblaci√≥n), art on the increasing Christian frontierlands. Most of the formerly called Mozarabic buildings receive nowadays also this denomination. In Catalonia and Aragon, a style ancestral to the Romanesque developed early in parallel with the region of Lombardy and it has become common to refer the formerly called late Catalan Pre-Romanesque as \\"first Romanesque\\" after the suggestions of Josep Puig i Cadafalch.

The Court found that the legislation was within the power of the province to legislate but it was in violation of the right to freedom of religion under section 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (\\"Charter\\"). However, it could be saved under section 1. Three issues were before the Court: # Whether the Act was within the legislative powers of the province provided by section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 # Whether any part of the Act violated sections 2(a), 7, or 15 of the Charter # Whether any violation could be saved under section 1 The Court found that the law was within the power of the province, that it violated section 2(a), but could be saved under section 1. They dismissed the appeals of Edwards, Longo and Magder, and allowed the Crown's appeal of the Nortown decision, entering a conviction against. Opinion of the Court The majority opinion was written by Dickson CJ, with Chouinard and LeDain JJ concurring. A second opinion was given by LaForest J, agreeing with Dickson CJ's judgement with a slight disagreement on his application of section 1. A third opinion was given by Beetz J, with McIntyre J concurring, agreeing with Dickson CJ's result but for different reasons, and also found that there was no violation of section 2(a). =Dickson= Dickson analyzed the pith and substance of the law in order to determine if the law can be characterized as a provincial power or a federal power. This analysis focused on the nature of the Act, whether it was religious in nature or secular in nature (i.e.. related to civil and property rights). He concluded that it was secular in nature. Dickson noted that the act was not attempting to advance any religious ideology, but rather was intending to provide employees with a day of rest. The choice of Sunday is not determinative of a religious purpose; other countries use Sunday as a day of rest for entirely secular reasons. The exemption for people of the Jewish faith is not sufficient to show a religious purpose either. Turning to the second issue, Dickson found a marginal violation of section 2(a) with respect to Nortown only. A company that has a legitimate and sincere religious practice that requires them to open a store on Sunday has the right to do so. The provision that attempts to accommodate those of the Jewish faith was insufficient to catch all sincere religious practitioners and so violated section 2(a). A law that indirectly places a burden on an individual or group that has the effect of degrading their ability to practise their religion is in violation of the Charter. Here, the law was requiring the store owner to choose between their religion or their business and so was degrading to their faith. Regarding section 7 and 15, Dickson found that there was no deprivation of liberty or adverse impact to violate section 7, and he also found that there could be no section 15 claim as the section had not yet come into effect at the time of the charge. On the third issue, Dickson found that the violation could be justified under section 1. In applying the Oakes test, he found that the purpose of giving people a day of rest was clearly pressing and substantial, as the well being of all workers is important, especially those in the retail industry. He found that the law was proportional as well. The law corresponded to the objective of giving all workers a day of rest, and the availability of exceptions provided for minimal impairment. =LaForest= LaForest agreed with everything Dickson found except for his interpretation of section 1. LaForest stated that focus must be put on deference to government to pursue its objectives, and on this basis the government should not have to worry as much about being as minimally impairing as Dickson suggested. =Beetz= The legislation is not the violation of freedom of religion. This violation is due to Saturday observer's choice of \\"religious tenets over economic benefit\\". Even if there were no universal day of rest, Saturday observers would still be economically disadvantaged as opposed to businesses which opted to stay open all seven days. Dissent Wilson J was the lone dissenter, claiming that the Act violated section 2(a) and could not be saved under section 1. Like LaForest, she agreed with Dickson's reasoning on the first two issues, however she did not agree with the analysis of section 1. Wilson focuses on the proportionality of the law. She found that the accommodations were insufficient. They were too selective, excluding important segments of the population, and created arbitrary classes of people.

Early career The third son of Hans Christoph Ernst, Baron von Gagern, a liberal statesman from Hesse, Heinrich von Gagern was born at Bayreuth, educated at the military academy at Munich and, as an officer in the service of the duke of Nassau, fought at Waterloo. Leaving the service after the war, he studied jurisprudence at Heidelberg, G√∂ttingen and Jena, where he became a member of the Urburschenschaft. In 1819, he went for a while to Geneva to complete his studies. In 1821 he began his official career as a lawyer in the grand-duchy of Hesse, and in 1832 was elected to the second chamber. Already at the universities he had proclaimed his Liberal sympathies as a member of the Burschenschaft, and he now threw himself into open opposition to the unconstitutional spirit of the Hessian government, an attitude which led to his dismissal from the state service in 1833. Henceforth he lived in comparative tiny a farm rented by his father at Monsheim, and occasionally publishing criticisms of public affairs, until the February revolution of 1848 and its echoes in Germany recalled him to active political life. For a short while he was at the head of the new Hessian administration; but his ambition was to share in the creation of a united Germany. The rise and fall of the 1848 Frankfurt Parliament At the Heidelberg meeting and the preliminary convention (Vorparlament) of Frankfurt he deeply impressed the assemblies with the breadth and moderation of his views; with the result that when the German national parliament met (18 May), he was elected its first president. His influence was at first paramount, both with the Unionist party and with the more moderate elements of the Left, and it was he who was mainly instrumental in imposing the principle of a united empire with a common parliament, and in carrying the election of the Archduke John as regent. With the growing split between the Great Germans (Grossdeutschen), who wished the new empire to include the Austrian provinces, and the Little Germans (Kleindeutschen), who realized that German unity could only be attained by excluding them, his position was shaken. On 11 December, when Schmerling and the Austrian members had left the cabinet, Gagern became head of the imperial ministry, and on 18 December he introduced a program (known as the Gagernsche Program) according to which Austria was to be excluded from the new federal state, but bound to it by a treaty of union. After a severe struggle this proposal was accepted; but the academic discussion on the constitution continued for weary months, and on 20 May, realizing the hopelessness of coming to terms with the ultra-democrats, Gagern and his friends resigned. Later career Later on he attempted to influence the Prussian Northern Union in the direction of the national policy, and he took part in the sessions of the Erfurt parliament; but, soon, realizing the hopelessness of any good results from the vacillating policy of Prussia, he retired from the contest, and, as a major in the service of the Schleswig-Holstein government, took part in the First Schleswig War of 1850. After the war he retired into private life at Heidelberg. In 1862, misled by the constitutional tendency of Austrian politics, he publicly declared in favor of the Great German party. In 1864 he went as Hessian envoy to Vienna, retiring in 1872 when the post was abolished. He died at Darmstadt in 1880.  References  * * Frank M√∂ller: Heinrich von Gagern. Eine Biographie.

It was drawn up in 1940 in case the French rejoined the Allies or of an Allied threat to the south of France. An important aspect was the capture of the French Navy. The original plan was never executed, but a version (Case Anton), which included Italian forces, was executed on 11 November 1942 in response to the Operation Torch landings in North Africa. The attempt to capture the French fleet, Operation Lila, failed due to the scuttling of the French fleet at Toulon, on orders of Admiral Jean de Laborde, to prevent its capture. As a result of the action, the Germans and Italians failed to gain the use of three battleships, seven cruisers, twenty-eight destroyers and twenty submarines. However, the destruction of the fleet also denied it to Charles de Gaulle and the Free French Forces, which explained Hitler's satisfaction at the result.

He worked throughout the Pacific Northwest in the field of landscape design. History Murase was born in San Francisco as a third generation Japanese- American. At the age of three, Murase and his family was sent to internment at Topaz War Relocation Center. They returned to San Francisco at the end of World World II. Murase graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a BLA in landscape architecture. He was hired by Robert Royston & Associates in 1965. To gain experience in the landscape architecture field Murase moved to Japan, where he maintained a practice for almost 10 years, conducting garden research at Kyoto University. He then moved to Portland, Oregon. He taught at the University of Oregon's Department of Landscape Architecture for a few years and then worked for the EDAW in Portland. In 1982, he formed Murase Associates in Portland, and opened a Seattle office in 1989. His firm went on to win about 50 design awards. He was a fellow member of the American Society of Landscape Architects and honorary member of American Institute of Architects, Seattle chapter. He died in July 2005 due to complications of a heart attack.  Designs and influences  Murase found roots in his own ancestry where he incorporated the elements that are often found in Japanese gardens. His signature material was stone, strongly influenced from stone sculptor Isamu Noguchi. The Japanese American Historical Plaza along Portland's waterfront was strongly influenced by the internment camp of 110,000 Japanese-Americans.Bennett, Sam. \\"Robert Murase: 'a poet of stone and water',\\" Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce. July 21, 2005. He influenced others by being a guest speaker at universities, museums, and other institutions. He recently authored Touching the Stones, a book tracing 100 years of Japanese American history, which is based on his design of the Japanese American Historical Plaza. Robert Murase died at age 66 from heart attack complications.Brown, Charles E. \\"Robert Murase, 66, noted landscape architect,\\" Seattle Times. July 23, 2005. Robert was known as a true artist who had soul, where his works were poetical and often spiritual due to the emotional thought process he had with designing sites. Influenced by his Japanese heritage, Robert used elements that mimicked nature. \\"I always considered him a poet of stone and water,\\" stated by John Nesholm of LMN Architects. Murase is well known for skillful and sublime compositions of stone, evident of an empathetic relation to the medium. However, he was arguably more adept at infusing sites with a sense of the spiritual (e.g. mystery, stillness, serenity, power, primordiality, reverence) despite whatever commotion surrounded it. This may be attributed to over a decade of self-directed exploration of Japanese artistic traditions, most notably garden design. He was greatly influenced by the artistic traditions of the Muromachi Period of 16th century Japan, when Zen flourished (subsequently influencing, transforming or leading to the creation of numerous art forms). \\"What attracts me to Japanese gardens lies in the essence of quietness which they express; their meditative emptiness, the illusion of nature, the effects of shadow and filtered light, and their stark simplicity. These gardens provide a sense of \\"wabi,\\" the absence of any ostentatious element, and a sense of humility and melancholy. There is a dark, mysterious quality about them, an undiscoverable unknown which goes beyond our individual small self, which could be described as \\"yugen\\" in Japanese. These are some of the qualities I strive to express in the design process\\", Murase elaborates on Japanese garden design and its influence on his process.  Notable projects  Murase took pride in many of his projects; but, according to colleagues, he was proudest of the Japanese American Historical Plaza along Portland's waterfront. Other projects include: *Astoria Waterfront Redevelopment, Astoria, Oregon. *Esther Short Park in Vancouver. *Garden of Remembrance downtown Seattle. *Goose Hollow/SW Jefferson St MAX light rail station, Portland, Oregon. *Grand Canyon transit center. *Japanese American Historical Plaza, Portland, Oregon. *Japanese American Museum in Los Angeles. *Murase Plaza at Wilsonville Memorial Park, Wilsonville, Oregon. *OMSI's bioswales, Portland, Oregon. *Oregon Convention Center's forecourt, Portland, Oregon. *Pier 69 headquarters of the Port of Seattle. *St. Croix National Scenic Riverway in Wisconsin. *Sumitomo Museum in Kyoto, Japan. *Sunset Transit Center landscape, near Portland, Oregon. *Town Center Park, Wilsonville, Oregon. * Willamette River Water Treatment Plant Park, Wilsonville, Oregon.

The school serves the communities of Northdale, Carrollwood Village, Lake Magdalene and other parts of northern Hillsborough County, such as Avila, and parts of southern Lutz. History and traditions When Gaither first opened up its doors in 1984-85, Seniors were not in attendance, and the school served only 9th-11th graders (Gaither did not have a class of 1985). In the 1985-86 year, (class of 1989) Gaither kept its doors open to 9th graders. The following year in 1986-87, Gaither ceased to include 9th graders and began to only house the 10th-12th grades until 1997 when Gaither reinstated a four-year program. Gaither‚Äòs graduating class of 1988 was the very first group of students that included all four years.

The Standards of Learning is supportive of and direct response to No Child Left Behind Act, which was signed into law by then- President George W. Bush on January 8, 2002. They address student achievement in [http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/index.shtml four critical areas: (1) English, (2) mathematics, (3) science, and (4) history/social studies. Students are assessed in English and mathematics in grades 3-8 and upon completion of certain high school level courses. Science and history SOL are administered in grades 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and at the end of completing high school courses in these respective subjects.  History  In 1992, Virginia tried to adopt an education plan known as the Common Core of Learning. A largely parent-driven grassroots movement opposed the Common Core of Learning, arguing that it held no meaningful education plan and seemed to be putting more emphasis on behavioral issues than education issues. After a debate at Huguenot High School, the Common Core of Learning was discarded, to be later replaced by the Standards of Learning. The SOL were created through a process involving parents, teachers, and common citizens. The SOL became the springboard for adhering to the new No Child Left Behind Act, which was enacted in January 2002. They were used as the basis for evaluation of administration, teachers, and students in public schools. = Establishing standards = In June 1995, the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) approved the Standards of Learning in four core content areas: mathematics, science, English, and history & social sciences. In September 1997, the Board of Education established new Standards of Accreditation (SOA) for public schools in Virginia that link statewide accountability tests to the SOL and hold students, schools, and school divisions accountable for results. The results of the SOL directly affect the schools that administer them as much as the students. If a certain passing rate is not met each year, the school can lose its accreditation. This sets higher standards for employment and puts more responsibility on teachers and administrators to focus on areas of learning that are fundamental to the Standards of Learning. The published results of the testing also help parents who are looking for schools with high achievement for their children, putting further pressure for success on school administrators and teachers. Before the SOL were implemented, the tests required to graduate affected the student, not the school. To graduate from high school, a student only needed to pass a sixth grade level test. As a result, 24-25% of new college freshmen needed remedial help. This level of literacy was unacceptable for the demands of the 21st century. The SOL set the bar higher for test-oriented education and performance-driven results. 64 percent in 2002, 78 percent in 2003, and 84 percent in 2004. In October 2005, the state reported that 92 percent of the Commonwealth's 1,834 schools received accreditation ratings for 2005‚Äì2006, with students meeting or exceeding state achievement objectives on Standards of Learning (SOL) tests and other statewide assessments in the four core academic areas.Press Release - September 2, 2005 The VDOE stopped reporting statewide results in 2006. However, complete results of all assessments in grades 3-8 and end-of-course tests for fall, spring, and summer may be found on the School Report Cards. = Standards of Accreditation = On January 14, 2010, the Board of Education announced that personal learning plans will be created for each middle and high school student to align the student's course of study with academic and career goals. This revision was made to the Regulations Establishing Standards for Accrediting Public Schools in Virginia.(8 VAC-20-131-5 et seq) The Virginia Department of Education has posted fact sheets detailing the timeline for changes, accreditation ratings, diploma requirements, and other documentation related to the SOL. Annual reports regarding the condition and needs of public education in the Commonwealth of Virginia are also located on the Virginia Government Website.  Scoring  A student must get a raw score of 400 or higher on their SOL(s) in order to pass the test. A student's advancement to the next grade is not contingent on passing any SOL tests. Passing with a raw score of 500 is considered advanced/proficient. A perfect score is 600. 399 or below is considered failure. The scores are scaled and do not correlate to the percentage of correct answers (a passing score of 400 does not indicate a student got 66% of the questions correct). Each test has its own scale and may not be the same as another SOL test.SOL Test Cut Score Explanation For students in grades 3-8, SOL scores are correlated to Lexile measures.http://www.lexile.com/about-lexile/How-to-get-lexile- measures/states/#South%20Carolina A Lexile measure can be used to match readers with targeted text and monitor growth in reading ability. For more information concerning the SOL(s) and Lexile measures, visit http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/scoring/lexile/index.shtml Several tests have been updated to the more advanced computer adaptive test (CAT) model, in which students are given a question, and based on whether or not the student got the answer correct or not, a computer gives the student either an easier or harder question. By using this model, many students have noticed worse scores on the tests. It remains controversial.  Controversy  The initial creation of the SOL caused extensive debate around both the validity of the tests and the administration of the process. Debate became more heated by the Department of Education's and the Secretary of Education's refusal to reveal information about tests or how the tests were created. The Department of Education was concerned that releasing actual tests would encourage \\"teaching to the test,\\" while parents and educators were concerned that tests would be poorly written and not test the targeted subject material.We'll teach shining shoes: Virginia school divisions responds to state-mandated standards Because teachers and administrators are evaluated based on students' SOL performance, there has also been concern that teachers will focus their teaching on SOL subject matter and omit much of the overall learning that is necessary in school. Every year, many teachers and administrators from schools around the state are invited to provide feedback on the tests. However, many teachers feel that the feedback process is just for show, and most report seeing no changes in new SOL's.

The song is regarded as one of Prince's first legitimate successes at rapping and is both an ode to and criticism of gangsta rap. Strong language and cursing is used throughout the track, but it ultimately elevates women with lyrics such as \\"A woman everyday should be thanked, not disrespected, not raped or spanked\\". \\"Days of Wild\\" is pure funk, relying heavily on bass guitar as well as the organ and samplers to create an infectious groove. The song contains an interpolation of Duke Ellington's 'Caravan'. \\"Days of Wild\\" was premiered live in concert in February 1994 along with other new material to promote Prince's new on-stage persona, performing all new material. Shortly thereafter, the studio version of this song and others were played as a promotion on European radio stations and began circulating among collectors. \\"Days of Wild\\" became a crowd favorite at concerts, despite it never being officially released. The song was originally to be released on 1995's The Gold Experience but ended up being pulled for unknown reasons. Comments by Prince and associates suggest that he may have simply been dissatisfied with the studio version, which pales in comparison to live performances. A live performance of the song (an edited version of a performance from August 5, 1995) was eventually broadcast on a VH1 special segment of Prince videos in 1996. It was also played at Paisley Park on December 9, 1995 and after some overdubbing, this particular version was eventually released on the 1998 Crystal Ball 3-CD set. Some time after this point, contemporaneous with his first separation and termination of marriage, one of Prince's (musical) mentors and his (then) ‚Äòspiritual guide,‚ÄôLarry Graham, influenced him to eliminate cursing from his music and change the lyrics of older songs to fit with his new, public, practicing morality. By 1998, Prince had revised the lyrics of \\"Days of Wild\\" in concert to eliminate the profanity. During the 2000 \\"Celebration\\" concert at the University of Minnesota, Prince even scolded the audience (\\"We don't do that no more!\\") when it began the \\"play that motherfuckin' bass!\\" chant associated with concert performances of the song. Longtime fans openly questioned Prince‚Äôs lyrical (and live performance) edits (that were not limited to this one track, either). This was largely attributed to the vision, depth, creative genius, and diligent work ethic displayed by Prince thus far. By this time, the persistent nature of Graham‚Äôs influence, timing, motivation, ties, and practices (including but not limited to those among Jehovah‚Äôs Witness entities) caused fans concerns that would later play out. Prince later affirmed that profanity and sexually explicit lyrics were eliminated (and/or rarely played, depending on the song,) due to fans attending his concerts more frequently with their own young children and grandchildren. This felt inappropriate in later years, particularly in certain venues. The B-side to the single is a live version of \\"1+1+1 is 3\\", a track from The Rainbow Children that was performed on the same tour and included on the live box set, One Nite Alone... Live!. An edit of \\"Days of Wild\\" was also included on the single. \\"1+1+1 is 3\\" is a funk number and a metaphor for God, man and wife as a union. The single was made publicly available to download initially, then with purchase of Celebration 2002 NPG member tickets/passes via CD at the end of the weeklong event, as complimentary to certain guests, among secondhand sales online, in the npg and Paisley Park Official online/retail outlets, and during concerts.

There are doubts about the historicity and existence of such a figure: as the Pashtun ethnicity began taking shape in the Bronze Age and Islam spread through Afghanistan over a period time as opposed to people changing faith in a single day.Islamic conquest of Afghanistan It is likely the conception of such a figure was promoted to bring harmony between religious identity and ethnic identity. Qais is said to have traveled to Mecca and Medina in Arabia during the early days of Islam.Meaning and Practice , Afghanistan Country Study: Religion, Illinois Institute of Technology (retrieved 18 January 2007). According to the folk tale, Qais had three sons: Sa·πõban (), Bƒì·π≠ (), and GharghaxÃåt ().Qais Abdul Rasheed. Khyber.ORG. His sons founded three tribal confederacies named after them: Sarbani, Bettani, and Gharghashti. Qais also had an adopted son, Karlani Ormur Baraki, who is progenitor of the Karlani tribe. There are multiple versions of the legend, including several regional variants that mention only one, two, or three of the four legendary brothers. Family Tree and Lineage Genealogical tree Some Afghan genealogies list Qais as the 37th descendant of King Talut (or Saul, reigned c. 1050 BC‚Äì1010 BC) through Malik Afghana, a legendary grandson of Talut.Dawn, The cradle of Pathan culture , by Alauddin Masood, 4 April 2004.Pakistan pictorial, Pakistan Publications, 2003.Niamatullah's history of the Afghans, Volume 1, Ni ªmat AllƒÅh, Nirod Bhusan Roy, Santiniketan Press, 1958, pg. 5. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the theory of Pashtun descent from the ancient Israelites is traced to TƒÅrƒ´kh-e KhƒÅn JahƒÅnƒ´ wa Makhzan-e AfghƒÅnƒ´ (), a history compiled by Nimat Allah al-Harawi during the reign of the Mughal emperor Jahangir in the 17th century. The Makhzan-e AfghƒÅnƒ´'s Israelite theory, however, has been dismissed by modern authorities due to numerous historical and linguistic inconsistencies. Legend Legend has it that Qais was born in the Ghor region of present-day central Afghanistan. Upon hearing about the advent of Islam, his tribe sent him to Medina in the Arabian Peninsula, in present-day Saudi Arabia. He met the Prophet Muhammad and embraced Islam there, and was given the name Abdur Rashƒ´d by the Prophet. He then returned to Ghor and introduced Islam to his tribe. According to Mountstuart Elphinstone, in legend the famous military leader and companion of Muhammad, Khalid ibn al-Walid, introduced Qais to the Prophet Muhammad. =Settlement= One legend has it that when Qais felt his time was near, he asked his sons to take him from Ghor to the Sulaiman Mountains and bury him at the spot where his ancestor Malik Afghana was buried, and he was buried on top of Takht-e-Sulaiman (\\"Throne of Solomon\\"), also called Da Kasƒ´ Ghar (, \\"Mount of Qais\\"), located near the village of Darazinda in Frontier Region Dera Ismail Khan of the FATA Districts of Pakistan, close to Frontier Region Dera Ismail Khan's borders with both South Waziristan and Zhob District, Balochistan. Some people visit the place, mostly in the summer, since in winters the snowfall makes it difficult to climb, and sacrifice an animal, usually a sheep or a goat at the tomb of Qais. According to another legend, however, Qais settled in the Balkh region of present-day northern Afghanistan. From there, his different descendants migrated south, west, and east. Genetics There is, however, no strong evidence to show any genealogical connection between the present-day Pashtuns and the ancient Semitic-speaking Israelites. DNA shows that Pashtuns have several Y-haplogroups, although R1a makes up about 51% among Pashtuns. Hence, Pashtuns have a significant affinity with their neighboring Indo-European speaking ethnic groups, See also *Amir Kror Suri, a legendary 8th-century Pashtun prince from Ghor *Amir Suri, a pagan Ghorid king in the 9th and 10th century who was defeated in war with the Saffarid emir Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar *Lech, Czech, and Rus, three legendary brothers who are said to have founded the three modern Slavic nations of Poles (or Lechites), Czechs, and Rus' (or Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians) *F√©nius Farsaid, a legendary Scythian prince who is said to have founded the modern Irish nation and invented the Ogham Irish alphabet *Asena, a she-wolf in the mythical foundation of the G√∂kt√ºrks *Hayk, legendary father of the Armenians References Category:Pashtun people Category:Converts to Islam from Judaism Category:Legendary progenitors Category:575 births Category:661 deaths Category:Companions of the Prophet ","title":"Qais Abdur Rashid"},{"id":"3000112","text":"Welcome to Norman Wells Norman Wells (Slavey language: T≈Çeg«´ÃÅh≈Çƒ±Ã® \\"where there is oil\\") is the regional centre for the Sahtu Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada.

Oil was first seen by Alexander Mackenzie during his exploration of the river in 1789 but it was not until 1911 that an oil bearing formation was discovered. Imperial Oil, a major employer in the town, was established in the area in 1937 with a refinery built in 1939. During the Second World War, Norman Wells was deemed important as a source of oil for military operations in Alaska and Yukon. The Canol Road and Canol pipeline project was undertaken to enable the piping of oil to Whitehorse, with the flow starting in 1944. Although Norman Wells crude was light and easily flowed at temperatures as low as , the line did not work well and was shut down shortly after the war ended. The road, which began at Canol Camp across the river, was abandoned. The Canol Heritage Trail is what remains of the road in the NWT. The Norman Wells Proven Area Agreement of 1944 is a partnership between Imperial Oil and the federal government (administered by Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) that has lasted to this day.

It is one of the places where the Israelites spent part of their 40 years of wandering after the Exodus, and was also a home to Ishmael, and a place of refuge for David. In Islamic tradition, it has often been equated with an area of the Hejaz. Biblical Paran Abraham sends Hagar and Ishmael into the Desert, illustration by Gustave Dor√© The Wilderness or Desert of Paran is said to be the place where the Egyptian servant girl Hagar of Abraham's wife Sarah (Sarai) and wife to Abraham in Genesis 16:3 (who by her suggestion made his wife and bore him a son Ishmael) was sent into exile from Abraham's dwelling in Beersheba ().

() > He said: \\"The LORD came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone > forth from Mount Paran. He came with myriads of holy ones, from his right > hand went a fiery law for them.\\" () King David spent some time in the wilderness of Paran after Samuel died (). 1 Kings 11:17-18 states that when Hadad the Edomite fled from Edom to Egypt, he passed through Midian and Paran on the way to Egypt. It is not certain precisely where the wilderness of Paran is to be located. It is often associated with Mount Sinai in Egypt, and there is some evidence that it may originally have referred to the southern portion of the Sinai Peninsula. The minor prophet Habakkuk references that \\"God is coming from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran\\" in Habakkuk 3:3. Both Eusebius (in his Onomasticon, a Bible dictionary) and Jerome reported that Paran was a city in Paran desert, in Arabia Deserta (beyond Arabia Nabataea), southeast of Eilat Pharan. Onomasticon, under Pharan, states: \\"(Now) a city beyond Arabia adjoining the desert of the Saracens [who wander in the desert] through which the children of Israel went moving (camp) from Sinai. Located (we say) beyond Arabia on the south, three days journey to the east of Aila (in the desert Pharan) where Scripture affirms Ismael dwelled, whence the Ishmaelites. It is said (we read) also that (king) Chodollagomor cut to pieces those in 'Pharan which is in the desert'.\\" Eusebius' mention of Chodollagomor here refers to a possible earlier mention of Paran in Genesis 14:6, which states that as he and the other kings allied with him were campaigning in the region of Sodom and Gomorrah, they smote \\"the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness\\". (KJV) Sebeos, the Armenian Bishop and historian, describing the Arab conquest of his time, wrote that the Arabs \\"assembled and came out from Paran\\".

Translation of the Samaritan Torah, p.90 .Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities Islamic traditions The Arab geographer Al-Muqaddasi mentioned in his book that the Red Sea branches into two \\"at the extremity of al-Hijaz at a place called Faran\\". The association of Paran in Genesis 21:21 with Ishmael and the Ishmaelites is affirmed by the Muslim geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi who writes \\"Faran, an arabized Hebrew word, one of the names of Mecca mentioned in the Torah.\\" Islamic and Arabic traditions hold that the wilderness of Paran is, broadly speaking, the Hejaz, the northern half of Tihamah, stretching along the east side of the Red Sea starting from Jordan and Sinai, and that the specific site where Ishmael settled is that of Mecca, near the mountains of Paran.The miracle of the well that happened to Hagar and Ishmael in Mecca is further identified in a hadith of Ibn Ezra with the well Zimum (Zimzum), \\"where the Arabs hold an annual festival\\", mentioned as the well of Hagar in Genesis 16:14: \\"She called the well Be'er Lachai Roi; it is between Kadesh and Bered\\". Dr Michael Sanders website The \\"Desert of Paran\\" is also interpreted as Hijaz in an old Arabic translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch. When it was translated into English in 1851, it was found to include a footnote making this interpretation. The name 'Paran' or 'Faran' has often been used to refer specifically to the wilderness and mountains near where Mecca is situated. Al-Hamdani in his book Geography of the Arabic Peninsula says that the Paran mountains around Mecca were named after Paran son of Amalek. Sam'ni in his Book of Surnames also says that the surname Farani is derived from the Faran mountains near Mecca in Hijaz Alt URL According to Wahb ibn Munabbih, there was a Tal Faran (\\"Hill of Faran\\") on the outskirts of Mecca, mentioned in his book Kitab al-Tijan, a Pre-Islamic Arabic folklore compilation. Ibn Munabbih further suggested an identification for Tal Faran as the 'mound of the Two runaways', a place where the Jurhum tribe found Hagar and Ishmael and thought of them as two runaways. Haggai Mazuz, a scholar of Islam associated with the Bar-Ilan University, asserts that Muslim polemicists' (like the Jewish convert Samaw æal al-Maghribƒ´, 1125‚Äì1175 CE) appropriation of Deut. 33:2 has antecedence in Jewish tradition itself, as some Midrashim and Targumim, before the rise of Islam itself, posed a connection between Paran and Ishmael-Arabs. For instance, commentating on the Sifrei Debarƒ´m, a halakhic midrash on Deuteronomy, dated from the 3rd to the 5th century CE, he says: > the link between Paran and the Arabs (actually the Arabic language), who are > also called Ishmaelites after Ishmael (among other names), is very early > although somewhat vague.Haggai Mazuz, \\"Tracing possible Jewish influence on > a common Islamic commentary on Deuteronomy 33:2\\" in Journal of Jewish > Studies, Autumn 2016, vol. 67, no. 2, p. 294 See also * Middle East * Wadi Feiran, whose oasis was identified by Ptolemy as \\"Paran\\" References External links * Baseinstitute.org * A 16th century French map showing Paran Category:Hebrew Bible regions Category:Vayeira Category:Hejaz ","title":"Desert of Paran"},{"id":"3000157","text":":For the amplifier of the same name see, Fender Bronco Amp The Fender Bronco was an electric guitar model produced by the Fender company from mid 1967 until 1981.

Biography =Early life and career= Jerry Iger was born in New York City, to Austrian-Jewish parents Rosa and Jacob Iger.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MLQ1-XTC He was raised in Idabel, Oklahoma, near the Choctaw Indian reservation.Adelman, Bob. Will Eisner: A Spirited Life (M Press, Milwaukie, Oregon, 2005), , , p. 351 The youngest of four children of a peddler who had settled in what was then the pre-statehood Indian Territory, Iger contracted polio as a child and was cared for by his mother.Adelman, pp. 351‚Äì2 Iger had two sisters,Adelman, p. 353 and a brother, Joe, whose son Arthur Iger (b. 1926)Adelman, p. 352 would become the father of The Walt Disney Company Chairman and CEO Bob Iger.Adelman, pp. 350‚Äì1 Arthur by the mid-1970s was vice president and publisher of the educational division of Macmillan Publishing in New York City.Adelman, p. 354 In 1925, Iger, by then living in New York, and despite no formal art training, became a news cartoonist for the New York American.Jerry Iger at the Lambiek Comiclopedia He entered the fledgling comic-book field 10 years later, contributing such one-page humor strips as \\"Bobby\\" (whose eponymous character was based on nephew Arthur), \\"Peewee\\" and \\"Happy Daze\\" to Famous Funnies, one of those seminal American comic books that reprinted black-and-white newspaper strips in color. Iger became founding editor of another such early comic book, Wow, What a Magazine!, which also included some new material. Wow lasted four issues (cover-dated July‚ÄìSept. & Nov. 1936) but brought Iger together with a 19-year-old Eisner ‚Äî future creator of The Spirit ‚Äî who wrote and drew the Wow adventure strip \\"Scott Dalton\\", the pirate strip \\"The Flame\\" and the secret agent strip \\"Harry Karry\\". =Comics packager= After Wow folded, Eisner and Iger, anticipating that the well of available reprints would soon run dry, in late 1936 formed Eisner & Iger,Eisner interview, Alter Ego #48 (May 2005), p. 7 one of the first comics \\"packagers\\" that produced outsourced comic-book material for publishers entering the new medium. Eisner & Iger was an immediate success, and the two soon had a stable of creators supplying work to Fox Comics, Fiction House, Quality Comics, and others. Turning a profit of $1.50 a page, Eisner claimed that he \\"got very rich before I was 22\\",Mercer, Marilyn, \\"The Only Real Middle-Class Crimefighter\\", New York (Sunday supplement, New York Herald Tribune), January 9, 1966; reprinted Alter Ego #48, May 2005 later detailing that in Depression-era 1939 alone, he and Iger \\"had split $25,000 between us\\", a considerable amount for the time. After Eisner left the firm in 1940, Iger would continue to package comics as the S. M. Iger Studio. He also started the small Phoenix Features newspaper syndicate, which in the early 1950s distributed a comic strip of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer. =Later career= Iger closed the comics studio in 1955 and served as an art director for the comic-book publisher Farrell Publications, a.k.a. Ajax-Farrell Publications, until 1957, whereupon he moved to commercial advertising artwork. He was a guest of honor at the 1974 New York Comic Art Convention, where he told a panel audience of his plans for an art show to raise money for cancer research, saying his mother had died of the disease.

By this time, he made his home in the Sunnyside neighborhood of Queens, New York City.

Between 1867-2001 \\"Lund Observatory\\" was also the name of the Observatory building, which is now referred to as the \\"Lund Old Observatory\\". As of January 2010, Lund Observatory is part of the Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics at Lund University. It is located in Lund, Sweden.  History  The institution was founded in 1749, but was preceded by an observatory built by astronomy professor Anders Spole (the grandfather of Anders Celsius) in 1672, which was destroyed at the Battle of Lund in 1676. The now old observatory from 1867 is located in a cultural-heritage protected observatory park just outside the medieval city boundaries. The department left these premises in 2001 for a new building on the northern campus of Lund University, inaugurated in 2001, using the nearby old water tower as their new location for astronomical observations. The history of astronomy in Lund through five centuries is told in the book Lunda√∂gon mot stj√§rnorna  Activities  Today Lund Observatory research activity focuses on observational and theoretical astrophysics. Areas covered include galaxy formation and evolution, exoplanet research, laboratory astrophysics, high- energy astrophysics, star clusters, and astrometry (Hipparcos and Gaia). = The Lund Panorama of the Milky Way = Towards the middle 20th century astronomer professor Knut Lundmark, of the Lund Observatory in Sweden, supervised the two engineers Martin Kesk√ºla and Tatjana Kesk√ºla who painstakingly mapped the positions of about 7000 individual stars to create an unprecedented drawing of the Milky Way. The map took two years to complete (it was completed in 1955), measures by , and is known as the Lund Panorama of the Milky Way. = Lund University Planetarium = The department runs a planetarium in Vattenhallen Science Center. The planetarium started in 1978 in what is now called the Old Observatory.

A·∏•madzai (, \\"descendants of A·∏•mad\\"; also spelled Ahmedzai) is a Sunni Muslim Pashtun tribe found in South Waziristan and Bannu District in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. They are a clan of the larger Wazir tribe.  Origins  The Ahmedzai, whose name is translated as \\"descendants of Ahmad\\", are a distinct tribe from the similarly-named community of Afghanistan. They form one of the two major branches of the Wazir tribe, with the other being the Utmanzai of North Waziristan Agency, Pakistan. The common ancestor of the Ahmadzai and Utmanzai is Wazir, who is also ancestor to the Mehsuds who have since taken a distinct and divergent path. Through Wazir, the tribes trace their origins to Karlanri and thence to the founder of the Pashtun lineage, Qais Abdur Rashid. Ahmad was a son of Wazir. The tribe are Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi sect, although not particularly strict in observance of their religious beliefs. It is possible that some have come under the influence of the Deobandi sect, followers of which have in recent years become active in areas where the tribe lives.  Location  The Ahmadzai were originally settled in the Birmal Valley area of modern-day Afghanistan. Today, they inhabit Pakistan and are primarily a pastoral community that earn a living from the rearing of sheep. Many Ahmadzai migrate between areas according to the seasons. The majority are found in Bannu District and around one-third live in the South Waziristan Agency, a Federally Administered Tribal Area of Pakistan. The North and South Waziristan agencies together form this region, which derives its name from the Wazir supra-tribe. Unlike the Utmanzai, the Ahmadzai generally co-exist peacefully with their Mehsud cousins. Many head men from the two tribes are connected by marriage.

It is part of the local government area. History Terrigal was first settled in 1826 by European Settler John Gray, who called his property Tarrygal, after the indigenous Aboriginal place name, signifying 'place of little birds'. Geography and climate The town's long beach is highly popular with tourists with a large Crowne Plaza hotel. Of geographical significance are the Terrigal lagoons. There are in fact two lagoons at Terrigal, one of which has been filled in to make way for a traffic oval. A local landmark is \\"The Skillion\\", a promontory which provides a view of all Terrigal. In recent years the Skillion has undergone rehabilitation by the local city council. Other popular attractions are the numerous nearby surf schools and trails. The Haven ‚Äì 2006 The Skillion is on a preserved area of land known as \\"The Haven\\". The Haven is centred by a popular public oval which is home of the \\"Terrigal Trojans\\", a Rugby Union club. Their new club house was provided by the former Gosford City Council. During the summer it is used by the Terrigal Matcham Cricket Club for both senior and junior fixtures. The Haven also has a popular boat ramp which is partnered by a diving club, and a small number of restaurants and cafes (due to tight development restrictions on the area). Terrigal in the 1920s Gosford City Council has invested Terrigal's CBD with a multi-level car park, esplanade walkway and stormwater drainage system. As a result of improved infrastructure and increased developer interest, Terrigal has become substantially more urban since the 1970s, when there was only one market, one medical centre and several orchards in the area. Terrigal's growth as a tourist destination and investment opportunity for wealthy individuals, such as holiday homes and small businesses, has had both positive and negative effects on the area. Terrigal, as a popular beach-destination, is generally relatively mild to warm all year round, although can become somewhat cool during the winter months. Amenities Just outside the CBD lie a number of amenities: a recently re-built hotel (2006), a primary school and high school (separate campuses), Catholic school, basketball stadium (used for training by Olympic athletes in the 2000 Sydney Olympics), and a large multi-purpose oval with three fields and year-round sporting activities. There have been calls for construction of a skate bowl park at the beach, similar to those at other surf beaches such as those at Bondi and Maroubra, to allow the many local skaters who currently use the esplanade and the space between the surf life saving club and the beach side car park. Recent development of high quality skate bowls at beach-side locations including nearby Copacabana Beach, Bar Beach at Newcastle, Port Macquarie, Cairns, and Cronulla (in advanced planning at the time of writing) have lent weight to the case for skate facilities at Terrigal. In April 2011, HMAS Adelaide was scuttled off Terrigal as a dive wreck.Home Adelaide Dive Wreck Transport Not far from the town centre are large shopping centres and M1 freeway () linked to Sydney (south) and Newcastle (north).

Nordstrom's father, a blacksmith, wainwright, and part-time farmer, died when Nordstrom was eight. Three years later, Nordstrom's mother took him out of school to work on the family farm. He emigrated to the United States at the age of 16. Arriving in America with $5 to his name, he worked his way across the continent taking jobs on railways and in mines, lumber camps and shipyards, eventually arriving in Seattle, Washington in 1896. While working at a sawmill he read a newspaper account of the discovery of gold in the Klondike and headed to Alaska to make his fortune. He invested in a claim on Gold Run, but his right to the claim was challenged and a lawsuit was filed. Nordstrom sold his claim when another party offered him $30,000 for it. After he sold it, he split the money with his two partners, and returned with his share ($13,000) to the warmer climate of Seattle. Nordstrom, Inc. In Seattle, Nordstrom attended business school, built two rental houses on Capitol Hill, and decided to join his friend, Carl Wallin, in the shoe business. He and Carl opened Wallin & Nordstrom, a shoe store, at Fourth Avenue and Pike Street in 1901. From that first shoe store grew the Nordstrom retail empire. John Nordstrom retired in 1928 selling his stake to his sons Everett Nordstrom and Elmer Nordstrom. Everett and Elmer also acquired Carl Wallin's share of the company. John's third son Lloyd Nordstrom joined the company as a part owner in 1933.

The first professional artist of the colony of New South Wales, he illustrated the earliest volumes of Australian natural history. Early life Lewin was the son of a professional scientific artist, William Lewin, who was the author of an eight-volume work The Birds of Great Britain (1789‚Äì94). William Lewin's two sons, John William and Thomas, worked with him preparing work. William acknowledges their work in the preface to his book. Around 1797, John Lewin was keen to visit New South Wales. To New South Wales John Lewin planned to travel on the for New South Wales in 1798 to record ornithological and entomological life for a British patron, Dru Drury. Somehow he missed this voyage but his wife travelled on it and arrived 3 May 1799. Lewin did travel on the Minerva, arriving 11 January 1800, becoming the first resident professional artist in the colony. The resulting books were intended to fund his passage home, but the fashion for Australian natural wonders was already fading by the time he published Prodromus Entomology, Natural History of Lepidopterous Insects of New South Wales, in 1805. Only six copies of his next book, Birds of New Holland with their Natural History, published in 1808 in London, have survived, which suggests that the remaining copies were somehow lost. An 1813 edition of the latter, made up from cast-off prints and pulls, was the first illustrated book to be engraved and printed in Australia. Birds of New South Wales, of which thirteen copies have survived, is considered one of the great Australian bibliographic rarities. Lewin's own, very basic, text was printed by the Government Printer George Howe. Sydney cove 1808 Lewin and his wife were granted a small farm near Parramatta, but by 1808 they were living in Sydney where the artist advertised his services as a portrait miniaturist. Governors Philip Gidley King and William Bligh were early patrons. Governor Macquarie, recognising the usefulness of a professional artist to his schemes for the colony, and to guarantee him an income, appointed him city coroner in 1810, and included him in the 1815 official inspection party of new lands discovered beyond the Blue Mountains. Lewin's watercolours of this expedition are now held by the State Library of New South Wales. Macquarie also commissioned illustrations of plants collected by the surveyor-general, John Oxley, in his explorations of the country beyond Bathurst, the Liverpool Plains and New England. Lewin died in Sydney on 27 August 1819 leaving a widow and a son. His tombstone can be found at Botany Bay Cemetery. He is commemorated in the names of two birds, Lewin's rail (Lewinia pectoralis) and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii) . Legacy His background as a natural history artist made Lewin an acute observer of the reality of the Australian landscape and its fauna and flora: critic Robert Hughes comments that he was the first to record the distinct 'look' of Australia without being blinded by European art conventions, and according to art historian Bernard Smith, \\"Lewin grasped the nature of the eucalyptus, its light translucent foliage through which the horizon may be seen, and the nature of the slender and feathery grasses of the interior. He succeeded, too, in portraying an authentic bush atmosphere.\\" Walter Wilson Froggatt stated in his memoir of Lewin:\\"he collected the insects in all stages of development, studied their life histories, noted their food plants, and made accurate coloured drawings from the living insects\\". Although Lewin was made an Associate of the Linnean Society, he was not part of the scientific milieu which surround significant naturalists such as Robert Brown, Sir Joseph Banks, or Alan Cunningham. Rather his training was that of a practical collector and artisan. He found it difficult to write about science ‚Äì indeed his own text for Birds of New South Wales is naive and simple. Rather he excelled as an observer, and although never a great natural history artist, brought to his own work a keen sense of observation and design. Indeed, his interaction with Australian flora and fauna sharpened his eye and art: he moved from producing very conventional natural history illustrations in England to strongly composed images set in local context in Australia. While he did not succeed as a publisher or printmaker, his large scale natural history watercolours of exotic Australian plants and animals appears to have found a steady market. He also seems to have had ambitions to be considered a professional artist, as opposed to simply an illustrator: he noted in 1812 that he had painted a 15 x 18 foot image of a corroboree. Lewin appears to have permanently settled in Australia, where he was one of the few professional artists, a fact from which he gained socially and professionally.

He achieved fame through becoming a famed vaudeville performer, specializing in ventriloquism. Early life and education Vernon was born Walter Lester Pope Knyvette, in East India, as the son of an English officer in the army. He educated at the University of Oxford. Career Vernon's act consisted of seven puppet characters who would engage in humorous dialogue with each other as well as Vernon. Although the dialogue undoubtedly provided a major element of the entertainment value in Vernon's act, further entertainment was derived from his sheer ability to jump from character to character without a hitch. His characters included the Old Maid, who sang; George, who had a severe stutter; Nettie, George's sister with a cleft lip; the Sailor; Joe, usually the main figure in the act; and Happy, a character who never spoke, but only laughed at the other characters‚Äô jokes. All six of these figures (the seventh is not among the group) are on display at the Vent Haven Museum in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. As time passed, however, Vernon began to lose his eyesight, and, according to correspondence, he eventually went blind on Christmas morning, 25 December 1920, in the middle of a performance at the Orpheum Theater in Spokane, Washington. However, this setback did not hinder Vernon's ventriloquist act in any way. He continued to travel and perform, never revealing to any of his audiences that he was blind. This was achieved by mounting his puppets together on a bench, which were connected to a thread running from the bench to the backstage, which was set up by Vernon's wife before the show began. Vernon would follow the thread to the bench, and once in the proper place, knowing where each control was, he was able to perform as though he could in fact see. Using this method he continued successfully performing for years. Death Vernon died on 17 May 1937, when he was struck by a speeding taxi cab in San Francisco, California. He was 70 years old.

Juni 1797, Gestorben 26. Oct. 1863. Gotthard Daniel Fritzsche (20 July 1797 ‚Äì 26 October 1863)The gravestone has birthdate as 20 June 1797, not July (\\"Geboren 20. Juni 1797\\"). was a Prussian-Australian pastor who became instrumental in furthering that religion in South Australia. He was born in Liebenwerda, in the Electorate of Saxony, Germany, and migrated to Australia in 1841. From 1842‚Äì1863, he was pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. He died and was buried at Lobethal, South Australia. Training and Early Ministry Gotthard Fritzsche went to Breslau after his gymnasium training, to receive his university training. There he studied under Johann Gottfried Scheibel. As was customary, after his university education, he served as a private tutor. At his first examination for entering the ministry, he declared himself to be against the Prussian Union, and was banned from ministry in the State church. He joined the underground Old Lutheran church as a Flying Pastor, who travelled from place to place disguised as a travelling tradesman, performing secret worship services and rites to those opposed to the State church. After a time, he grew weary of the work, and he travelled to Hamburg. Immigration to Australia Fritzsche arrived in Hamburg when a group of Prussian Old Lutherans were searching for financing and a pastor to join their group in emigrating to South Australia. In 1840, at the synodical gathering of the newly constituted Lutheran Church in Australia, a request had been sent to the Old Lutherans in Prussia to send a second pastor to the young German settlement. A requirement had been imposed on them by the Prussian government, that they must be accompanied by a pastor before being allowed to emigrate. Fritzsche was not eager to emigrate. He had already declined an invitation by Johannes Grabau to emigrate to the United States. However, he did relent to the requests of the people who were waiting to emigrate to South Australia. Fritzsche travelled to England to meet with George Angas in an attempt to gain financing for the balance of the fares, a sum of over ¬£2000. Angas was unable to provide any financing to the group. It was in early June that a letter was received from a \\"Mrs. Richardson in Newcastle UK\\", with a sum of ¬£270. The remainder of the required finances (¬£1800) was donated by one of the other emigrants, Mrs Anna (Hannchen) Nehrlich. Fritzsche had become engaged to her daughter Johanna Dorothea (Dorchen, Dorette), while in Hamburg. The group set sail for Australia, on 11 July 1841 on the ship Skjold, arriving on 28 October 1841 at Port Misery, South Australia. The migrants settled at Lobethal, and Bethanien. Fritzsche made his home at Lobethal. Settlement in South Australia Original Seminary School in Lobethal Fritzsche took on pastoral duties at Lobethal and the neighbouring communities, as part of the German settlement in Australia. Relations with the earlier Prussian settlers was initially harmonious, but soon deteriorated. In 1842 Pastor August Kavel, in an attempt to consolidate the settlers into one localised community, strongly urged the settlers in the early settlements at Klemzig and Hahndorf to relocate to the newly settled Langmeil. Many of the settlers in these towns refused, and an underlying tension arose between these communities and Pastor Kavel. Division in the Church Over time, Fritzsche learned that Kavel had developed a millennialistic point of view (which Fritzsche disagreed with), and had the subject discussed at the synod gatherings in 1844 and 1845. No resolution was reached at these gatherings. In addition to this disagreement, Fritzsche also differed with Kavel, in a proclamation released in 1846, regarding the power of civil government in the church. These disagreements between the two pastors intensified a division which had developed in the Lutheran community. Memorial of Gotthard Fritzsche in Lobethal At the synodical gathering at Bethany, on 16 and 17 August 1846, the subject of millennialism was again raised, and when the disagreement became heated, a divide was forged, when the Kavel followers left and formed their own synod. At this point, Fritzsche became the head of the Evangelical Church of South Australia.

Organization While started to work in 1973 (before the Spanish withdrawal from Western Sahara), its official foundation was in 1975. Initially an important part of POLISARIO, as much of the Sahrawis who joined the movement in the first years were Fos Bucraa workers, its importance has diminished as a result of the mass exodus of Sahrawis, mostly in the 1975-76 period, at the beginning of the Western Sahara War. There is little need for a labor union in the refugee camps of Tindouf, Algeria, where unemployment is near total, and what work exists is organized by the camp administration. The movement therefore appears largely dormant in its labor union role until an independent Western Sahara would provide it with a normally functioning labor market again. It remains a part of the POLISARIO structure, though, and has internal representation at several levels. The general secretary (elected in the UGTSARIO congresses) is also member of the Polisario Front National Committee. The organization is directed by the Executive Bureau, which is composed of 9 members (6 from the Sahrawi refugee camps and 3 from the Occupied Territories, which identity is kept in secret for security reasons) elected in the congresses. It campaigns internationally to attract attention to the Sahrawi cause, and enjoys good relations with many European and African trade unions. It also has members in the Moroccan controlled parts of Western Sahara, although it is banned by the Moroccan authorities. The organization is divided in four branches, as for example the UPES, Union de Periodistas y Escritores Saharauis (\\"Sahrawi Journalists and Writers Union\\")Uni√≥n de Periodistas y Escritores Saharauis (UPES) or the UJS, Union de Juristas Saharauis (\\"Sahrawi Jurists Union\\"). UGTSARIO is member of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU)New affiliations with the WFTU n¬∫ 12 World Federation of Trade Unions and the Organization of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU). It also has observer status in the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC). Its present general secretary is Mohamed Cheikh Lehbib.

The last one issued a Declaration in solidarity with the Sahrawi people who have been disappeared, tortured or detained by the Moroccan government, against the exploitation of the natural resources by multinational companies, rejecting the preferential status given to Morocco by the EU and supporting the Sahrawi refugees. The declaration was signed by several trade unions as CCOO, UGT, USO, CIG, ELA (Spain), UGTA (Algeria), CGIL (Italy), CGTP (Portugal), COSATU (South Africa), NLC (Nigeria), COC (Mexico), FSM (Greece), AWU, ACTU (Australia).

At the age of twelve he was inspired by The Shadows to start his own instrumental band called Beatboys, where he played rhythm guitar.Forfod, Erik (2005) \\"Gjenh√∏r med Dag Spantell\\", P√• dansefot, January 12, 2005. Retrieved 28 October 2010 A huge fan of The Beatles he later joined the band Misfits in 1964, where he was a member until co-founding the band Happie in 1967. Writing many of his own songs he was clearly inspired by The Beatles, vocal harmonies and the psychedelia of the time. At 18 he had his first TV appearance with Happie and their song Flowergirl. Spantell looked set on retiring from music life, and educated himself as a cook in 1969. However he would continue as a musician, mainly as the lead singer of the dance band Kjell Karlsens Orkester. In 1973 he was given the song Kjendis-party, a Norwegian translation of the Ricky Nelson-hit Garden Party. The song became widely popular and reached No. 4 on Norsktoppen (an official chart for music in Norwegian). In 1975 his song En helt alminnelig sang om sommer reached the No. 1 spot. Through the 1970s Spantell recorded numerous singles and two albums as a solo artist, but most notably he appeared on several albums together with other artists. From 1975 to 1978 he became a part of the enormously popular P√• Treff-gang, a group of four singers (the others being Inger Lise Rypdal, Stein Ingebrigtsen and Gro Anita Sch√∏nn) who put out several albums with covers of international hit songs, often translated to Norwegian (during this period the four released nine albums). He toured extensively through the decade, often as part of P√• Treff, and participated four times in the Norwegian finals for the Eurovision Song Contest. For a period he was also lead singer in another dance band, Torry Enghs. In 1978 he had a gig in the small fishing community of B√•tsfjord in Northern Norway when a fight broke out. Spantell stepped in to separate the fighters and was dealt a serious blow to the throat that crushed his larynx. His singing career seemed over, but he forced himself to participate on the song Sol with the band Strikk, which became a huge radio hit in the summer of 1980. Spantell then left the music industry and opened up a convenience store. In 1989 he made a brief stint singing in a band performing at the Royal Palace in Oslo, for the 18th birthday of Princess M√§rtha Louise. He then became the manager for two popular restaurants in T√∏nsberg and Ris√∏r, co-owned by three other artists. From 1996 to 2002 he was cruise manager for the ferry between Bergen, Norway and Newcastle, England before returning to the music business. In 2004 the up-and-coming Norwegian rappers Jaa9 and OnklP contacted him about doing a new version of his 1973-hit Kjendis-party. The song became the national breakthrough for the young rappers and one of the most played songs of 2004. Spantell himself made several concert appearances with the boys and its success laid the foundation for a comeback on the Norwegian music scene. In 2005 he released his first solo album since the 1970s, Det beste fra Dag Spantell, a greatest hits collection including 22 of his songs from 1968 to 1970.Rakvaag, Geir (2004) \\"Gamle sanger fra jukeboksen \\", Dagsavisen, December 27, 2004.

The game features six different weapons to combat the BioMetals, an extraterrestrial race determined to destroy the human race. The gameplay is very similar to that of the R-Type series, with the final boss even greatly resembling and behaving similarly to that series' iconic boss enemy Dobkeratops. BioMetal is unique in that its soundtrack for the European and North American versions was entirely created by techno group, 2 Unlimited (the selections used for BioMetal were remixes of songs from their 1991 album, Get Ready!). The Japanese version of the game featured an entirely different soundtrack. A sequel called BioMetal Gust was released for the Sega Saturn in 1997, included with the Dezaemon 2 pack. Story Even in the first level of the game, the enemies come after the player in a fast and furious manner. It is the year GC 232 (Galaxy Century Year 232). A huge war that had begun years and years before has divided the Milky Way and all of its natural resources have been exhausted. The Milky Way Galactic Council is forced to send a fleet of starships to a nearby planet by the name of UP457 in search of any resources that can replenish the ones lost during the battle. However, during this mission, the fleet is destroyed by a race of half-machine, half- animal aliens referred to as \\"BIOMETAL\\" by the Galactic Council. One of the Council's supercomputers then calculates that the number of these \\"BIOMETALS\\" is increasing rapidly and will have the Milky Way completely taken over within 32 hours. So the Halbard's crew, young pilot Kid Ray and biologist Anita (a reference to the names of the two lead singers of 2 Unlimited, who provided the music for the North American/European version of the game), along with their fleet, WASP, are assigned to eliminate the hostile threat on UP457. Gameplay Weapon power-ups are gained by destroying pods and picking up the released power-ups, which cycle through the various weapon types as in Raiden. Some weapons cancel each other out. The player also has a shield in the form of four spinning orbs that circle around the ship when engaged. Charge power is drained when the shield is active. The shield can be used as protection against enemy fire.  Reception  Famitsu gave it a 23/40.

During her career she has contributed to the designs of many high-profile buildings in both Canada and the United States, including the Robson Square and Law Courts Complex in Vancouver, the National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian Chancery in Washington D.C., the Library Square at the Vancouver Public Library, the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, and Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly Building in Yellowknife. Her firm, Cornelia Hahn Oberlander Landscape Architects, was founded in 1953, when she moved to Vancouver. Life and family partial view of grounds, Peacekeeping Monument, Ottawa, Canada Oberlander was born at Muelheim-Ruhr, Germany, on June 20, 1921. She is the niece of the German-Jewish educationalist Kurt Hahn, the founder of Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, Gordonstoun in Scotland and UWC Atlantic College in the UK; and Elisabeth Jastrow, the German-born American classical archaeologist. In 1938, when Oberlander was 18, she and her sister and mother escaped Nazi persecution after the \\"Kristallnacht\\" [Night of Broken Glass] pogrom and fled to England, and then emigrated to the United States in 1939. Her mother, Beate Hahn, a horticulturist who wrote gardening books for children, fostered in her a deep love and appreciation for nature from a young age.Prominent Canadian Landscape Architect To Speak At U.Va. School Of Architecture , University of Virginia News, 9 March 2001, retrieved 2 July 2010. Since she had a garden bed when she was four years old and planted peas and corn, she knew the joy of growing. In an interview with Mechtild Manus, tracing the roots of Oberlander's interests in landscape architecture, Oberlander stated \\"At the age of eleven...I studied a mural in the artist's studio showing the river Rhine and an imaginary town. When I asked the artist about the green spaces in this mural, she told me that these were parks. When I came home I told my mother 'I want to make parks.' From there all my education was directed towards becoming a landscape architect.\\" Her mother had a truck farm during the war, in New Hampshire, which Oberlander worked on. She came to America with the hopes of exploring the professional education opportunities that involve the creation of parks and green spaces. \\"Acclaimed landscape architect's Oral History\\", The Cultural Landscape Foundation August 3-5 2008. In 1944 Oberlander received a BA from Smith College, and in 1947 was among the first class of women to graduate from Harvard with a degree in landscape architecture.\\"Acclaimed landscape architect honored\\", Smith e-news June 2006. In her interview with Hall she states, \\"When I went to Smith, women who wanted to become landscape architects went to the Cambridge School, a part of Harvard University, because at that time, women could not attend Harvard. But with the war that changed, and in 1943 I was one of the very first women to be admitted to the Harvard Graduate School of Design.\\" Her future husband, Peter Oberlander, received a PhD in regional planning from Harvard, and they met at a class picnic. They were married in 1953 and had three children. Peter Oberlander, a Canadian architect and Canada's first professor of Urban and Regional Planning, died on December 27, 2008. Oberlander began work with Louis Kahn and Oscar Stonorov in Philadelphia and then with landscape architect Dan Kiley in Vermont before moving with her husband in 1953 to Vancouver, where she founded a small landscape architecture firm. In Vancouver, Oberlander became interested in the modern art movement led by B.C. Binning and Ned Pratt, which combined art and architecture to address the connections between urbanism and surrounding natural settings. In 1999‚Äì2000, she contributed her expertise to the Vancouver Art Gallery's Out of This Century exhibition, guiding patrons through the selection of visual art pieces that were chosen from the gallery's permanent collection (by Oberlander and five other Vancouverites) to reflect and represent the city's art scene through the decades. The early years of Oberlander's career were dedicated to designing landscapes for low-income housing projects and playgrounds, the most famous of which is the Canadian Government Pavilion, Children's Creative Centre & play area for Expo 67 in Montreal.Cornelia Hahn Oberlander Fonds Retrieved 2020-04-14. Her first playground, for a 1951 public housing project for architect Louis Kahn, included a vegetable garden and a fruit tree. In public housing in Maclean Park, she designed a playground. On Skeena Terrace, on the Lougheed Highway, she included vegetable gardens.Margolese Prize Winner Cornelia Oberlander on Landscapes, Cities and Healing Souls She now practices on a more commercial scale, working with architects and other professionals from different disciplines to create aesthetic solutions for challenging projects. Before beginning a project she researches it thoroughly to ensure that her innovative schemes will also be practical and long-lasting. Oberlander always approaches a project from an environmental standpoint, stating in her Convocation Address for the acceptance of an honorary degree from Simon Fraser University: > I dream of Green Cities with Green Buildings where rural and urban > activities live in harmony.[...] \\"Achieving a fit\\" between the built form > and the land has been my dictum. This can only be done if all our design- > related professions collaborate and thereby demonstrate co-operatively their > relevance in meeting the enormous developmental challenges facing our > increasingly crowded urban regions.SFU honorary degree recipients' > convocation addresses Her concern for the environment and for people in general is further exemplified by her involvement with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem on Mount Scopus. Oberlander and her husband, Peter, visited Israel for a congress with the International Federation of Landscape Architects in 1962. According to the Jewish Independent, the Oberlanders were in Israel to study irrigation systems but they \\"fell more deeply in love with the land and its people.\\" The Oberlanders engaged in and spearheaded many activities to benefit the university from 1979 on, including: setting up a Canadian Studies Program, bringing boxes of Canadian textbooks to Israel for donation to the university, developing a botanical garden, working with a team of planners to assist the community of Ashkalon in accommodating settlers from North Africa and Georgia, and advocating the restoration of historic buildings on the campus. The Oberlanders were recently honored for their contributions by the Vancouver chapter of Canadian Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2004 and have visited Israel many times in their philanthropic efforts. Oberlander has received the \\"rare and exceptional honour\\" of being elected to both the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects' College of Fellows (in 1981) and the American Society of Landscape Architects' Council of Fellows (in 1992).

The Manitoba Eco-Network does not lobby and is non-partisan; however, some of its member groups are partisan organizations and may lobby government or participate in government consultations. The Steering Committee of the organization is elected at the Annual General Meeting and is composed of representatives of member groups and one or two individual members. Funding is provided by The Government of Manitoba, The Government of Canada, various foundations and granting agencies, membership fees, donations, and through fundraising events. In 2019, cuts to Manitoba's environmental programming budgets threatened the organization's future. Projects of The Manitoba Eco- Network = Alice Chambers Memorial Library = The Alice Chambers Memorial Library is a public library of environmental information. It contains several thousand items, including books, journals, DVDs, and periodicals. In addition, the library is a public registry for development proposals in the Province of Manitoba. The Eco-Network has also partnered with another library in Manitoba (Ducks Unlimited) to offer an inter-library loan program. =Children's Health and Environment Partnership= The Children's Health and Environment Partnership was formed in 2003. At that time, it was a partnership between several environmental NGOs attempting to educate the public about the effects of environmental issues on the health of children. It was then called \\"The Children's Environmental Health Project\\". In from 2006 to 2008, it went through several changes and became a more formal project. A new website was launched and the name was changed to its current incarnation, The Children's Health and Environment Project. In its current form, The Children's Health and Environment Partnership is composed of five supporting member groups, including The Manitoba Eco-Network. =Climate Change Connection= Climate Change Connection is an initiative to provide public education and outreach to Manitobans about [Climate Change]. This organization takes the position that man-made climate change is occurring. The organization was \\"started in January 2002 as part of Canada's effort to meet our Kyoto Protocol objectives.\\" Climate Change Connection is partially funded by The Province of Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro, which is the main Manitoban electricity utility. It is jointly governed by The Manitoba Eco-Network and The University of Winnipeg. The organization frequently holds free workshops for young people to educate them about climate change, and teach them about potential ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. =ecoDriver Manitoba= The ecoDriver Manitoba program is the result of a partnership between Resource Conservation Manitoba and the Manitoba EcoNetwork. According to the ecoDriver website, it is \\"a public outreach and education program aimed at helping Manitoba drivers save money by reducing their fuel consumption and at the same time decrease CO2 emissions.\\" It was established in 2009 in a partnership with Manitoba Public Insurance and The Centre for Sustainable Transportation. =Eco-Journal= The Manitoba Eco- Network publishes the Eco-Journal five times per year, which features articles about Manitoba's environmental issues. It serves to provide a platform for individuals and groups to reach out to the community and share issues that may not be frequently covered in mainstream local press.

The Winnipeg Green Map was produced to help the public identify environmental businesses, transportation methods, projects, and initiatives in their communities. It is available online and is built on a platform using Google Maps. The Spence Neighbourhood Green Map is a more detailed version of the Winnipeg Green Map, focusing solely on the Spence Neighbourhood region of Winnipeg. The Manigotagan River Map was produced to encourage use of Manitoba's natural Manigotagan River for recreational purposes such as canoeing, and to promote the river's preservation. This map is unique and gives a lot of details for each rapid. An online map also provides many more photos and more information. =Manitoba Environmental Youth Network= In October 2007, The Manitoba Eco-Network held an environmentally themed youth forum called Greenspace with the intention of stirring more youth involvement in the organization. There was a strong response, and several participants requested that a support group should be formed. In response, The Manitoba Eco-Network launched a new website and project called The Manitoba Environmental Youth Network. To better engage the younger demographic which the network aims to support, the website was built in the form of a self- contained [social network] on the Ning platform. The Manitoba Environmental Youth Network website is used by the community as a resource to plan events, participate in discussions, and seek out connections and support from other young environmentalists. =Organic Lawn Care Education= The Organic Lawn Care Education project was established by The Manitoba Eco-Network to provide workshops on organic lawn care practices and lawn care without harmful chemicals with the goal of decreasing exposure to pesticides and insecticides, and preventing excessive algae growth caused by water runoff from fertilizers. =Water Caucus= The Manitoba Eco-Network's Water Caucus is intended to support other environmental organizations in Manitoba with interests in water issues. It plays a similar role with water-themed environmental organizations to the role the Manitoba Eco-Network plays with all environmental organizations, in the sense that it is a non-advocacy group, but some of the groups it supports do have advocacy or partisan components. As part of its services, the Water Caucus provides an information directory on water issues to the public and a series of informative publications. Other Activities of The Manitoba Eco-Network In addition to the services provided by its projects, The Manitoba Eco-Network: *Provides its member groups with meeting space in the boardroom of the Eco-Centre, which is a Gold Level LEED Certified green building. *Holds an annual member forum to facilitate discussion between different environmental organizations in Manitoba. *Facilitates communication between the member groups, various levels of government, and the media by referring media enquiries to relevant member groups, and by connecting member groups to Environmental Assessment processed initiated by the government. *Publicizes environmental events such as conferences, workshops, and film showings through The Manitoba Eco-Network's website and the electronic newsletter which is sent out to individual and group members. *Provides a collection of news excerpts about environmental issues on its website to help viewers stay informed about current events. *Connects individuals who are looking to volunteer with member groups which are looking for extra help through the Eco-Volunteer program. *Hosts an annual Environmental Awards ceremony to celebrate individuals, groups, and businesses which demonstrate exceptional innovation or quality with regards to environmental initiatives.

The story deals with class conflicts, the influence of fathers, and vengeance as viewed through the third-person perspective of a young, impressionable child. It precedes The Hamlet, The Town, and The Mansion, the three novels that make up Faulkner's Snopes trilogy. Characters *Colonel Sartoris Snopes (\\"Sarty\\") - protagonist *Abner Snopes ‚Äì patriarch of the Snopes family, personal hobby of burning barns, Antagonist *Lennie Snopes ‚Äì wife of Abner and mom of Sarty *Lizzie ‚Äì unmarried sister of Lennie Snopes *Major de Spain - Snopes's employer who Sarty warns about the barn burning *Mr. Harris - Abner's first mentioned landowner *Colonel John Snopes - Sarty's brother *Sarty's two \\"bovine\\" sisters Synopsis Barn Burning (set in about 1895) opens in a country drug store, which is doubling as a Justice of the Peace Court. A hungry boy named Sarty craves the stew and bread in the store. He is afraid. His father, Abner Snopes, is in court, accused of burning down Mr. Harris's barn. Sarty is called up to testify against his father, and he knows that he is going to have to lie and say his father did not burn the barn. The Justice and Mr. Harris realize they are putting the young boy in a bad position, and they let him off the hook. The Judge tells Mr. Snopes to leave the county and never come back. As Sarty leaves the courthouse, a kid calls him \\"Barn Burner!\\" and knocks him down, twice. Sarty tries to chase the kid but his father stops him. Sarty, his older brother, and his father get into the family wagon, where his mother, aunt, and two sisters are waiting. The wagon is already loaded with their broken possessions. That night, the family camps. After Sarty falls asleep, his father wakes him up and tells Sarty to follow him. Sarty does. His father accuses him of being on the verge of betraying him in court. He hits Sarty. Then he tells him that the most important thing is to stand by one's family. The next day the Snopes family arrives at their new home, a shack on the farm where they will be working as tenant farmers. Abner wants to talk to the owner and he takes Sarty with him. When Sarty sees the owner's fancy, white mansion he feels like everything just might be all right after all. He thinks his father can not possibly hurt people who live in a house like that. On the way to the front door, Sarty notices that Abner deliberately steps in some fresh horse excrement. At the front door, a \\"House Negro\\" greets them and tells Snopes to wipe off his boots. In defiance of the request for politeness, Snopes pushes past with a racial insult and tracks the excrement all over the white rug in the front room. Later that day, the owner of the rug and mansion, Mr. de Spain, has the rug dropped off at Abner's shack. Abner sets his two daughters to cleaning it, and then dries it in front of the fire. Early the next morning, Abner wakes Sarty and the two of them return the rug to de Spain. De Spain shows up shortly after, insulting Abner and complaining that the rug is \\"ruined\\". He tells Abner that he is going to charge him twenty extra bushels of corn to pay for the hundred-dollar rug. When he leaves, Sarty tells Abner that they should not give de Spain any corn at all. After working hard all week, Sarty goes with his family to town that Saturday. He goes with his father into a store, and sees that a Justice of the Peace Court is in session. De Spain is there. Sarty does not realize that Abner is suing de Spain to have the fee of twenty bushels reduced. Sarty blurts out that his father is not guilty of burning any barns. Abner sends him back to the wagon, but he stays in the store to see what happens. The Justice decides that Abner is responsible for the damage to the rug, but he reduces the fee to ten bushels. Sarty, his father, and his brother spend some time in town and do not go home until the sun has almost set. After dinner, Sarty hears his mother trying to stop his father from doing something. He realizes his father is planning to burn the de Spain barn. His father and brother realize that Sarty is planning on alerting de Spain, and they leave him behind, held tight in his mother's arms. Sarty breaks free and runs to the de Spain house. He is only able to say \\"Barn!\\" a few times, and then he is on the run again. De Spain is right behind him, about to run him over. Sarty jumps into a ditch and then returns to the road. He hears three gunshots soon after. At midnight Sarty is on top of a hill. He has come a long way. Everything is behind him. He mourns the loss of his father (who he seems to assume is dead), but is no longer afraid. He falls asleep and feels better when he wakes up. The whippoorwills are singing and it's almost morning. He starts walking toward the woods in front of him. He does not turn around. Adaptations In 1980, the story was adapted into a short film of the same name by director Peter Werner. It starred Tommy Lee Jones as Abner Snopes, Shawn Whittington as Sartoris Snopes, and Faulkner's nephew as De Spain. Earlier, in 1958, Martin Ritt directed a film called The Long, Hot Summer featuring actor Paul Newman. This film was based on three of Faulkner's works including \\"Barn Burning.\\" There is also a Malaysian adaptation titled The Arsonist (Malay: Kaki Bakar) made in 1995 by U-Wei Haji Saari. The Snopes family being post-Civil War farmers are instead rewritten as Javanese immigrants who had just moved into a new rubber plantation. The film Burning performs a stylistic adaptation merging elements of the Faulkner story with the Haruki Murakami story of the same name.

It operated stores in other areas of the country including the midwestern and southeastern states, and internationally in the Caribbean and Canada. The company was founded and headquartered in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and moved to Brooklyn, New York in the early 20th century. Grand Union moved again to Elmwood Park, New Jersey and finally to Wayne, New Jersey before the company was forced into Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001 and sold to C&S; Wholesale Grocers. After C&S; bought Grand Union it down-scaled most of its operations, keeping only a number of stores in upstate New York and New England open. The chain was sold to Tops Friendly Markets in 2012; in 2013 Tops rebranded the remaining Grand Union stores with the Tops logo and the Grand Union name was discontinued. History =Origins= Grand Union's famous \\"red dot\\" logo. Introduced in the 1980s as part of a rebranding, it ceased to be the company's logo following C&S;' purchase of the company. Some of the stores that remained in the chain continued to use this logo afterward. Grand Union started in Scranton, Pennsylvania as the Jones Brothers Tea Company in 1872. By the 1930s it was one of the largest grocery chains in the United States.Grand Union by Groceria The name \\"Grand Union\\" was inspired by the desire to \\"unite shoppers with low prices in a 'Grand Union of Value as described by company associate Elvin Sanders. The store's mascot was Abraham Lincoln wearing a deli apron, and most stores featured a costumed Lincoln to accomplish deeds, talk to customers, and proclaim the general splendor of the Grand Union, and to urge them to \\"Save the Union\\" when the company faced economic hardship. In the early 1950s, Grand Union began construction on a new shopping center in what was then known as East Paterson (now Elmwood Park) New Jersey. The strip was to include a new Grand Union store with an office tower attached that would serve as the company's new corporate headquarters. The store and new headquarters opened in 1951. In 1987, Grand Union moved its corporate headquarters to Willowbrook Center in Wayne, abandoning its Elmwood Park offices. Grand Union did not close the Elmwood Park store, though, and it remained in operation until 2001.The Grand Union Company history (via TheFundingUniverse.com) In 1956, Grand Union opened a discount department store chain (called Grand Way) in Keansburg, New Jersey. Many of these stores combined a grocery store and a department store, which was similar to the combination Bradlees and Stop & Shop stores that were around during that time as well. Others were separate stores. For instance, a multi-level Grand Way store was built on a vacant lot across from the Elmwood Park corporate headquarters while the company built a strip mall in nearby Paramus, where the Grand Way anchored one end with the Grand Union anchoring the other. These stores were eventually closed and sold to other competitors, such as Winn- Dixie. The Elmwood Park and Paramus Grand Way stores were sold to Kmart; the Paramus store was liquidated and closed in December 2014 while the Elmwood Park store met that same fate in 2017. In 1959, Grand Union's 38 stores it operated in Ontario, Canada, were sold to Steinberg's (supermarket), a Quebec- based supermarket and department store chain. Those locations were quickly rebranded into Steinberg's grocery stores, but over time most of their former Grand Union stores were closed and moved to new stores, due to poor locations compared to local competitors. =Ownership by \\"The Red Raider\\" James Goldsmith= British corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith acquired Grand Union in the early 1970s. Grand Union was a money loser during much of Goldsmith's time of ownership. Goldsmith presided over the closing of the Grand Way chain in 1975 and the exit of Grand Union from most of the rest of the nation outside of the Northeast and New England in the mid-1980s. In the 1980s Grand Union acquired many former A&P; stores in northern New Jersey that A&P; closed after acquiring the metropolitan New York operations of Stop & Shop and a controlling stake in the southern grocery chain Big Star Markets. In October 1986, Grand Union leased ten stores in the Albany area from Weis Markets, including nine stores that had operated under the Albany Public Markets banner.\\"Weis will lease ten stores in Albany,\\" Daily News (Huntingdon, Pennsylvania), 13 Oct 1986 In the mid-1980s, Goldsmith brought in former Target Corporation executive Floyd Hall to manage the chain. Goldsmith also had world-renowned artist Milton Glaser complete a graphical redesign of the chain, which included the \\"red dot\\" theme. Through the new management under Hall, the chain was able to make record-making profits throughout the late 1980s. Goldsmith sold the chain to Floyd Hall and a group of investors in 1988. The chain, however, was quickly resold. =1989 acquisition by Gary Hirsch= In 1989, investment banker Gary D. Hirsch, a partner in the firm Miller Tabak Hirsch & Co. acquired a portion of the Grand Union Company with Salomon Brothers. Grand Union was Hirsch's fourth major supermarket purchase since 1987, as he had acquired the Pennsylvania-based Penn Traffic, the Syracuse, New York-based P&C; Foods, and the Columbus, Ohio-based Big Bear Stores in the previous two years. Hirsch assumed the position of chairman while Joseph McCaig became CEO. Floyd Hall left upon the acquisition. Under Hirsch's leadership the company was driven into serious debt and ran out of the necessary capital for store improvements and upgrades, making it difficult for them to compete with other better financed retailers. Still, gradually, Grand Union remodeled most of its stores. Some of its older, run-down stores were closed and converted to other uses. Grand Union's big disadvantage was that its average store was 35,000 square feet while most supermarkets being built were over 50,000. The company also built a few larger stores. In 1995, Grand Union's ongoing financial difficulties forced the company into its first bankruptcy as it filed for Chapter 11. In 1996, shortly after Grand Union emerged, Hirsch announced his resignation and sold his share of the company. =The J. Wayne Harris era= A Grand Union store in Glenmont, New York, in 2004. In 1997, Grand Union brought in J. Wayne Harris to begin a turnaround of the ailing chain. Harris had recently been an executive at A&P; and at Kroger, and had an excellent reputation in the industry. Harris immediately began remodeling stores and building larger ones, which put even more stress on the company's finances and forced another Chapter 11 filing in 1998. The company emerged again in 1999 and had $175 million in new capital, which Harris used to finish the remodels on the stores that were still in the process and to acquire more construction permits for larger stores. He also used some of the money for new store formats, with three emerging. One was \\"Grand Union Fresh Market\\", which catered more to an upscale gourmet clientele more in the vein of its competitor Kings. Another was a discount grocery store named \\"Mega Save\\". A third was Grand Union's answer to limited selection chains such as Aldi and Save-A-Lot, called \\"Hot Dot\\". None of these ideas worked out, and again Grand Union's finances reached dire straits. In addition to this, many of Grand Union's executives were found to have been stealing money such as Don Vaillancourt, who was convicted of embezzling over $2 million from the company in 2002. Harris was forced out in 2000 and took a job with JCPenney, who hired him to revive their Eckerd drugstore chain. Harris failed to do that as well, and Eckerd was sold to a combination of Jean Coutu Group and CVS Corporation in 2004. Its stores were converted to the Rite Aid banner. In addition to the now-critical debt being borne by Grand Union, the company was unable to build the stores it wanted to as there was not enough money left. A Fishkill, New York store was sold to a ShopRite ownership group before it could open, and the construction of a store in its home area of Wayne, New Jersey, was halted for over a year. In October 2000, Grand Union filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a third time. Two months later, the bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy after it was discovered that the damage Harris' failed ideas and the embezzlement scandal had done to the company left it with so little money that Grand Union could not operate or supply any of its stores. A search for a buyer began, but in spite of the filing the stores continued to do business as before. =2001 acquisition by C&S; Wholesale Grocers= Bolton Landing, NY; now a Tops Grand Union's Chapter 7 filing had a large effect on its supplier C&S; Wholesale Grocers, a New England-based wholesale food distributor of which Grand Union was its largest customer. C&S; also was one of Grand Union's largest creditors, and made a stalking horse offer to take control of the company in early 2001 that was approved. Shortly afterward, C&S; began reorganizing Grand Union's operations. This resulted in a consolidation that left the chain with only a relatively small number of stores in smaller cities and towns across Upstate New York and New England. In addition, Grand Union's stores in the Northeast, where it was long established, were closed. Many of the medium-sized and most of the larger Grand Union stores, as well as most of the construction permits for stores that had yet to be built or finished, were sold to Ahold while C&S; continued to supply the stores. At the time of the acquisition of Grand Union by C&S;, Ahold had been looking to establish a presence in the Northeast as well through its Edwards Super Food Stores chain and was initially a bidder for Grand Union. Eventually Ahold converted the Edwards stores to Stop & Shop, reintroducing the brand to the area, and later converted the Grand Union stores it acquired to Stop & Shops as well. Ahold began supplying Grand Union stores for some time prior to their rebranding. This meant that although the store retained the Grand Union sign on the outside and various other signage on the inside, it had Stop & Shop branded items on the shelves. Other supermarket chains that purchased Grand Union stores included Tops, which was at the time also an Ahold subsidiary, Shaw's, Hannaford, Price Chopper and Pathmark. Some of the other medium-sized stores were sold to department store chains such as Marshalls and Kohl's, while many of the smaller stores were sold to independent grocers and drugstore chains such as Eckerd, Rite Aid, CVS, and Walgreens. Other stores, like the former flagship in Elmwood Park, were demolished after closing and replaced with other buildings. One of five former Grand Union stores that became a Hannaford Supermarket As for the stores that remained under the Grand Union banner, they became part of a rebranded Grand Union Family Markets, complete with a new logo that discarded the 1980s \\"Red Dot\\" logo. Many of the stores did keep the Red Dot, although not all of them did. =Acquisition by Tops Markets= 2006 photo of a Grand Union store in Johnson, Vermont On July 19, 2012, Tops Markets announced that it would acquire the 21 remaining Grand Union stores in the Adirondack Region and parts of Vermont. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. On May 28, 2013 grand reopening ceremonies were held for 9 stores which had been re-bannered under the Tops Friendly Markets name. The remaining 12 stores held grand reopening ceremonies on July 2, 2013 under the Tops Friendly Markets banner, effectively bringing an end to the Grand Union supermarket chain.

It is based upon maintaining a balance between two competing interests: Trying to maximize total throughput of the network (wired or not) while at the same time allowing all users at least a minimal level of service. This is done by assigning each data flow a data rate or a scheduling priority (depending on the implementation) that is inversely proportional to its anticipated resource consumption. Guowang Miao, Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, , 2016. Weighted fair queuing Proportionally fair scheduling can be achieved by means of weighted fair queuing (WFQ), by setting the scheduling weights for data flow i to w_i = 1 / c_i, where the cost c_i is the amount of consumed resources per data bit. For instance: * In CDMA spread spectrum cellular networks, the cost may be the required energy per bit in the transmit power control (the increased interference level). * In wireless communication with link adaptation, the cost may be the required time to transmit a certain number of bits using the modulation and error coding scheme that this required. An example of this is EVDO networks, where reported SNR is used as the primary costing factor. * In wireless networks with fast Dynamic Channel Allocation, the cost may be the number of nearby base station sites that can not use the same frequency channel simultaneously, in view to avoid co-channel interference. User prioritization Another way to schedule data transfer that leads to similar results is through the use of prioritization coefficients. Here we schedule the channel for the station that has the maximum of the priority function: > P=\\\\frac{T^\\\\alpha}{R^\\\\beta} * T denotes the data rate potentially achievable for the station in the present time slot. * R is the historical average data rate of this station. * \\\\alpha and \\\\beta tune the \\"fairness\\" of the scheduler. By adjusting \\\\alpha and \\\\beta in the formula above, we are able to adjust the balance between serving the best mobiles (the ones in the best channel conditions) more often and serving the costly mobiles often enough that they have an acceptable level of performance. In the extreme case (\\\\alpha=0 and \\\\beta=1) the scheduler acts in a round-robin fashion and serves all mobiles equally often, with no regard for resource consumption. If \\\\alpha=1 and \\\\beta=0 then the scheduler will always serve the mobile with the best channel conditions. This will maximize the throughput of the channel while stations with low T are not served at all. Using \\\\alpha\\\\approx1 and \\\\beta\\\\approx1 will yield the proportional fair scheduling algorithm used in 3G networks. This technique can be further parametrized by using a \\"memory constant\\" that determines the period of time over which the station data rate used in calculating the priority function is averaged. A larger constant generally improves throughput at the expense of reduced short-term fairness.

The music centers on a set of cylindrical bamboo trumpets called vaccine, but also features drums, maracas, g√ºiras or g√ºiros (a percussion instrument), and metal bells, as well as alsos which are made from recycled metal, often coffee cans. The vaccine perform repeating patterns in hocket and often strike their instruments rhythmically with a stick while blowing into them. In the modern day, standard trumpets and saxophones may also be used. The genre though predominantly Afro- based has some Taino Amerindian elements to it such as the use of g√ºiros and maracas. left The songs are always performed in Haitian Creole and typically celebrate the African ancestry of the Afro-Haitian masses. Vodou is often implemented through the procession.gag√°. Rara in Haiti is celebrated to commemorate part of the slave revolution that led to independence. At the time when it started, slaves were not allowed to travel or communicate between plantations. They were allowed to leave the plantation only to go to church for easter. It was the one time each year where mixing, even in chains, was allowed. The African people of different tribes used both speech and music to communicate. Beating drums were used as a common rudimentary universal language. Stripped of that tool, the African slaves used the sound of their feet marching to church to make rhythm and communicate between chains. These minute and terse communications played a part in planning the many revolutions and led to an eventual independence. During rara Haitians dance and march in the street while the band plays. Each band has their own rhythm that defines them even while marching in the dark. It is a celebration of the now but also a remembrance of the ancestors who made it so. Each person has their own unique way of dancing to the beat. Rara in Haiti is often used for political purposes, with candidates commissioning songs praising them and their campaigns. Rara lyrics also often address difficult issues, such as political oppression or poverty. Consequently, rara groups and other musicians have been banned from performing and even forced into exile‚Äîmost notably, folk singer Manno Charlemagne who later returned to Haiti and was elected mayor of Port- au-Prince in the 1990s. Rara performances are often performed while marching and are often accompanied by twirlers employing metal batons. Performances generally begin on Ash Wednesday and culminate at Easter Weekend. Rara was also an important part of a slave's daily lives. Working in the fields, and plantation of endless crops, was agony. And at the end of the day, Rara's would take place in the streets, to show how good they were still doing, even after such hard and meaningless work. After Haiti's independence, rara bands took the streets by storm to celebrate, the victory. The war won. The Rara festival is likely to have developed during the period of colonial slavery. There is evidence that African and Afro-Creole slaves in the French colony of Saint-Domingue paraded with drums and instruments on Easter Sunday. There is also some evidence that troupes of maroons marched with drummers, horns, and singers, similarly to Rara. right Since the 1990s, Haitian Americans have been performing Rara in New York City's Prospect Park in the summer on Sundays.Learning website on Rara References * McAlister, Elizabeth.

He was a member of the band White Lion, performing with them from 1984 to 1991. He was later the bassist for Black Label Society, Megadeth and Slash's Snakepit. Outside music, he is known for being a contestant on the 21st season of the reality television series The Amazing Race. Career =Early days, White Lion, Zakk Wylde, and other projects (1977-2005)= In the late 1970s, he started in a band called \\"Empty Sky\\", a rock band with hints of jazz. The band was based out of Brooklyn and was one of the biggest up-and-coming young bands. LoMenzo was the lead vocalist and bassist. The band consisted of Robert Littera at lead guitar, Julie Pontecorvo on trumpet, Marco Lagana on trombone, Frank Bonanno on tenor saxophone, Oscar Olivera on drums, Vincent Chirico on rhythm guitar and John Buccellato on electric piano. The band broke up as the members began to mature and take their separate career paths. He played bass with Clockwork, his first original hard rock band in 1980 to 1983. He then went on to play in the band Rondinelli with Ray Gillen before joining White Lion in 1984. He played bass with White Lion from 1984 to 1991, and then went on with White Lion drummer Greg D'Angelo to play with former Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley, and then later with Zakk Wylde's side-project Lynyrd Skynhead who evolved into Pride & Glory and released one album in 1994. Although he left the band during their 1994 tour, he returned to play on Zakk Wylde's 1996 solo album Book of Shadows. He had a brief stint in the recording studio with Ozzy Osbourne in 1994 but the sessions were not used, and Ozzmosis was re-recorded by different musicians the next year. In 1995, LoMenzo, along with Pride & Glory drummer Brian Tichy joined Slash's Snakepit as touring musicians. He was a member of David Lee Roth's band in the late 1990s and early 2000s and performed on his album Diamond Dave. In 2004, LoMenzo rejoined Zakk Wylde in his band Black Label Society until October 2005 when he was replaced by Black Label Society's original bassist John DeServio. =Megadeth (2006-2010)= From February 10, 2006 up until February 8, 2010, LoMenzo was the bassist of thrash metal band Megadeth. The first Megadeth record he performed on was 2007's United Abominations. LoMenzo also performed on the band's next album, Endgame from 2009. On February 8, 2010, it was announced that original Megadeth bassist Dave Ellefson replaced LoMenzo. =Post-Megadeth (2010-present)= In 2010, LoMenzo played bass for Lynch Mob. He is also part of the band \\"Hideous Sun Demons.\\" LoMenzo played bass on the album \\"Get Your Rock On\\" by X-Drive which was released August 25, 2014 via Frontiers Records and produced by Led Zeppelin engineer Andy Johns. He is also featured on the upcoming Sweet & Lynch album, \\"Only to Rise\\" featuring Michael Sweet, George Lynch, and Brian Tichy due out on Frontiers Records (January 27, 2015). In October, 2013, he joined former Creedence member, John Fogerty's band. As of June 2020, LoMenzo plays for the band Firstborne, the first project created by Chris Adler (Lamb of God, Megadeth). Other LoMenzo is also a graphic artist and did the art work for Gilby Clarke's solo album Rubber in 1998. Also, in 1997, he did the photos in Mike Tramp's first solo album Capricorn. LoMenzo is also a member of a tribute band called HAIL!. HAIL!'s rotating cast of members include Andreas Kisser, Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens, Paul Bostaph, David Ellefson, Mike Portnoy, Jimmy DeGrasso, and Roy Mayorga. Owens, DeGrasso, Ellefson and Kisser formed the band in late 2008. The band toured Europe in 2009, and in June 2010, HAIL! was on their second European tour with the line- up Andreas Kisser, Tim Owens, Paul Bostaph, and LoMenzo. Due to the death of previously announced Slipknot bassist Paul Gray, LoMenzo agreed on only one day‚Äôs notice to fly to Portugal and play the Rock in Rio festival where HAIL! was scheduled to perform on May 30, 2010. Lomenzo also joined Lynch Mob in late July 2010, replacing Marco Mendoza. LoMenzo previously jammed with Lynch Mob drummer Brian Tichy in both Pride & Glory and Slash's Snakepit. On August 29, 2012, LoMenzo was announced as a cast member of The Amazing Race 21 along with his partner Mark \\"Abba\\" Abbattista. They ended up in 6th place out of 11 teams and were the sixth team eliminated at Sokolniki Park in Moscow, Russia due to an unsuccessful search for Abba's stolen passport. In October 2014, LoMenzo briefly joined former Megadeth members Nick Menza and Chris Poland for an unnamed project. Shortly after announcing this project, LoMenzo left, to be replaced by OHM bassist Robby Pagliari. Nick Menza would go on to join OHM as drummer, filling the role left by David Eagle's passing. http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/james-lomenzo-exits-new-project-feat-fellow- ex-megadeth-members-nick-menza-chris-poland/ Gear LoMenzo is best known for his frequent use of the Warwick Buzzard bass and Warwick Stryker bass. His amplification section is dominated by Ashdown amps and cabinets. His effects pedals include Dunlop Crybaby, MXR Chorus, MXR Distortion, and Aphex Punch as well as other pedals. He has his own signature pedal, the Ashdown Lomenzo Hyperdrive. His rig bears a strong resemblance to that of John Entwistle, who also used Ashdown amps and Buzzard basses (which he designed himself). LoMenzo's live rig can be seen here. He is an endorser of RotoSound bass strings. He is also known to play a spyder model Alembic bass guitar. He was also seen playing a Fender Marcus Miller Jazz Bass for the entirety of the 2007 Megadeth Tour of Duty. As of September 2008, LoMenzo has been seen playing a Yamaha BB Custom Shop model; which in itself, has a slightly smaller body than a standard BB, two pairs of P bass pick-ups (one reversed), a neck pick-up based on a Gibson Model One, a maple neck and a Hipshot D-Tuner. Some Megadeth photos show LoMenzo playing Yamaha Attitude Ltd models that also have the P-bass/neck pickup and D-tuner configuration.

Oil on canvas. 116.8 x 91.4 cm. Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art Kindred Spirits (1849) is a painting by Asher Brown Durand, a member of the Hudson River School of painters. It depicts the painter Thomas Cole, who had died in 1848, and his friend, the poet William Cullen Bryant, in the Catskill Mountains. The landscape painting, which combines geographical features in Kaaterskill Clove and a minuscule depiction of Kaaterskill Falls, is not a literal depiction of American geography. Rather, it is an idealized memory of Cole's discovery of the region more than twenty years prior, his friendship with Bryant, and his ideas about American nature. Kindred Spirit is exhibited in the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. History The painting was commissioned by New York art collector and advocate Jonathan Sturges as a gift to Bryant who in May 1848 had presented a eulogy for the painter Cole (who had unexpectedly died in February of that year). Sturges explained the gift by writing: ::::::Soon after you [Bryant] delivered your oration in the life and death of our lamented friend Cole, ::::::I requested Mr. Durand to paint a picture in which he should associate our departed friend and ::::::yourself as kindred spirits. ... I hope that you will accept the picture from me as a token of ::::::gratitude for the labor of love performed on that occasion. ::::::::::::::::::::‚Äî Letter from Sturges to Bryant Within days of receiving the painting, Bryant wrote thank you notes to both Sturges and Durant expressing his praise for the work. Bryant described his first impression of the gift to Durand, writing, \\"I was more delighted with it than I can express, and am under very great obligations to you for having put so much of your acknowledged genius into a work intended for me.\\" He continued on to state that \\"the painting seems to me in your best manner, which is the highest praise.\\" According to Bryant, visitors to his home admired the painting too. \\"Every body admires it greatly,\\" he wrote, \\"and places it high as a work of art.\\" A few weeks after the painting was delivered to Bryant, it was exhibited at the National Academy of Design. While there it received high praise in the press and periodicals. By then it was known as, Kindred Spirits, a title inspired by John Keats' \\"Sonnet to Solitude.\\" ::::::Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind, :::::::::Whose words are images of thought refin‚Äôd, ::::::Is my soul's pleasure; and it sure must be :::::::::Almost the highest bliss of human-kind, ::::::When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee. In 1904, Bryant's daughter Julia donated the painting to the New York Public Library. In 2005, it was sold at auction to Walmart heiress Alice Walton for $35 million, a record for a painting by an American artist. The Library was criticized for \\"jettisoning part of the city's cultural patrimony,\\" but the Library defended its move stating it needed the money for its endowment fund. The painting was on display at the National Gallery of Art between 2005 and 2007. Currently, the painting is held in the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. Composition At its heart, Kindred Spirits is a memory piece. Durand, a friend of both Cole and Bryant, depicted his friends in their companionate stance in a location they both expressed in their creative pieces. Cole would depict the area beginning in 1826 with his painting Kaaterskill Falls and the area soon became an icon of the burgeoning American landscape painting. Bryant, poet and newspaper editor, would poetically capture the Kaaterskill in his poem \\"Caaterskill Falls.\\" Combining two locations--Kaaterskill Falls and the Clove--in an idealized format, the painting illustrates the idea of communing with Nature. As kindred spirits, Cole and Bryant both shared a passion for the American landscape. In the summer of 1840, Bryant explored the Kaaterskill area of the Catskills with Cole. Standing on the ledge looking out towards the valley, the paintings‚Äô figures of Bryant and Cole illustrate Cole's 1836 description: ::::::‚Äú‚Ä¶in gazing on the pure creations of the Almighty, he feels a calm religious tone steal through ::::::his mind, and when he has turned to mingle with his fellow men, the chords which have been ::::::struck in the sweet communion cease not to vibrate.‚Äù :::::::::::::::::::‚Äî Essay on American Scenery Durand included the names of these kindred spirits within the landscape itself by carving in paint their names into the birch tree on the left side of the painting. By painting Cole and Bryant together in Kindred Spirits, Durand created a visual record of the relationship between the art and literary circles of the early nineteenth century, as well as their common beliefs toward the American landscape and Nature. Today, Kindred Spirits has come to symbolize both the Hudson River School and its era's culture. Conceived as a memory piece for Cole, Kindred Spirits may now be said to be a visual memory of the era in which it was created. The painting is part of the permanent collection at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. In popular culture In his 1998 book A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, Bill Bryson describes his love for the painting and how he would love to jump into the scene depicted. Marianne Moore references the painting in her poem The Camperdown Elm.https://brooklynbased.com/2012/10/16/brooklyn-history-the- singularly-curious-weeping-elm/  References  External links *American paradise: the world of the Hudson River school, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on Kindred Spirits (see index) *National Gallery of Art press release Category:Hudson River School paintings Category:1849 paintings Category:Collection of the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art ","title":"Kindred Spirits (painting)"},{"id":"3000798","text":"Personal Preference is a 1987 board game created by Donal Carlston that involves guessing the order in which a player prefers foods, activities, people, and other items compared to one another. The game was published by Broderbund in the United States, Playtoy Industries in Canada, and Parker Brothers International in Britain. The game contains cards in four categories: Food & Drink, Activities, People, and Potpourri (miscellaneous). Each card has a photo or drawing on each side and text indicating what that side represents (e.g., chocolate √©clairs, climbing a mountain, Harrison Ford, spy novels). Each round, one player draws four cards from one category, or one from each category, depending on the player's position on the board. Each card is placed in a colored quadrant of the board. The player then ranks these four items according to his or her preference using color-coded cards that are placed in an envelope. Next, other players (or teams) use numbered tiles to guess that player's order, and move forward one space for each correct guess when the order is revealed. If players choose to double a guess by placing a tile towards the center of the board, they move forward two spaces if correct and back one space if incorrect. Players take turns drawing and ranking cards until someone reaches the end of the board.

Jeffery Company was an American automobile manufacturer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, from 1902 until 1916. The company manufactured the Rambler and Jeffery brand motorcars. It was preceded by the Gormully & Jeffery Manufacturing Company, a bicycle manufacturer. It was the parent company to Nash Motors, thus one of the parent companies of American Motors and Chrysler.  Thomas B. Jeffery  Thomas B. Jeffery Thomas B. Jeffery and his 1897 Rambler prototype Thomas B. Jeffery was an inventor and an industrialist. He was one of America's first entrepreneurs interested in automobiles in the late 19th century. In 1897, he built his first prototype motorcar. Thomas B. Jeffery was serious enough about automobiles to sell his stake in Gormully & Jeffery to the American Bicycle Company to finance the new car company.  Business  Charles T. Jeffery driving a 1901 Rambler model A Charles T. Jeffery (left) Charles W. Nash (right) Charles T. Jeffery's (Thomas' son) experimental prototypes of 1901 (Models A & B) used at least two radical innovations ‚Äì steering wheels and front-mounted engines. By the time Charles was ready for production in 1902, his father had talked him out of these wild dreams and convinced him to stick with tillers and engines under the seat. From 1902 until 1908, Jeffery moved steadily to bigger, more reliable models starting with the 1902 . Jeffery cars were built on assembly lines (the second manufacturer to adopt them‚ÄîRansom E. Olds was first), and in 1903 Jeffery sold 1,350 Ramblers. By 1905, Jeffery more than doubled this number. One reason may have been because Charles went back to the steering wheel before 1904. In 1907, Jeffery was building a large variety of different body styles and sizes. Among them was a five-passenger, US$2,500 Rambler weighing 2,600 pounds (1179 kg) and powered by a 40-horsepower (30 kW) engine. In April 1910, Thomas B. Jeffery, died in Pompeii, Italy, and in June of that year the business was incorporated under the name of the Thomas B. Jeffery Company, with Charles T. Jeffery as the president and general manager, H. W. Jeffery, vice president and treasurer. In 1915, Charles T. Jeffery, changed the automotive branding from Rambler to Jeffery to honor the founder, his father, Thomas B. Jeffery. As of 1916, G. H. Eddy replaced H.W. Jeffery as the treasurer so H.W. Jeffery could focus on the position of vice president. G. W. Greiner was the secretary, L. H. Bill the general manager, J. W. DeCou the factory manager, and Al Recke was the sales manager. Charles T. Jeffery survived the sinking of the RMS Lusitania (a British luxury liner torpedoed by the Germans in World War I) in 1915 and decided to spend the rest of his life in a more enjoyable manner. Charles W. Nash, no longer at General Motors, saw an opportunity and bought the Thomas B. Jeffery Company in August 1916.  The Factory  The sprawling Jeffery works circa 1915 Jeffery factory building Jeffery company employees Jeffery, with the money from his sale of Gormully & Jeffery, bought the old Sterling Bicycle Company's factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The original factory building was only 600 x 100 feet (183 x 30 m) in size. However, by 1916, the company's buildings expanded over 20 acres (8 ha) under roof and the facilities had grown to over 100 acres (40 ha) including a test track. Automotive production would continue on the site under a number of succeeding companies. The final plant, Kenosha Engine, was closed by Chrysler in 2010.  Jeffery Quad  The Jeffery Quad, also known as the Nash Quad or Quad is a four-wheel drive truck that was developed and built in Kenosha from 1913, and after 1916, by Nash Motors, as well as under license by other truck makers.. The Quad introduced numerous engineering innovations. Its design and durability proved effective in traversing the muddy, rough, and unpaved roads of the times. The Quad also became one of the effective work vehicles in World War I. The Quad was also one of the first successful four-wheel drive vehicles ever to be made, and its production continued unchanged through 1928, or 15 years, with a total of 41,674 units made.  Timeline  1897 ‚Äì Jeffery builds a rear-engine Rambler prototype using the Rambler name previously used on a highly successful line of bicycles made by Gormully & Jeffery. 1899 ‚Äì Positive reviews at the 1899 Chicago International Exhibition & Tournament and the first National Automobile Show in New York City prompt the Jefferys to enter the automobile business. 1900 (Dec 6) ‚Äì Thomas B. Jeffery finalizes a US$65,000 deal to buy the Kenosha, Wisconsin, factory of the defunct Sterling Bicycle with money from the sale of his interest in Gormully & Jeffery. 1901 ‚Äì Two more prototypes, Models A and B, are made. 1902 ‚Äì First production Ramblers ‚Äì the US$750 Model C open runabout and the $850 Model D (the same car with a folding top). Both are powered by an , one-cylinder engine mounted beneath the seat, and are steered by a right-side tiller.

Shabbatonim Each year, Rochelle Zell has three Shabbatonim, one for freshmen, one for seniors, and one for the entire school community. Each Shabbaton features the opportunity to build community among both students and faculty and celebrate the joy of Shabbat. The programs over the course of the day are planned both by students and faculty. They feature the school at its best, celebrating Jewish life and Jewish time, having fun with friends, and delving deep into discussion topics of shared meaning. Model UN The RZJHS Model United Nations Team received first place awards at the National Model UN Conference for 6th consecutive year in March 2020. Holidays The Rochelle Zell Jewish High School calendar is built around the rhythm of Jewish life. Throughout the course of the year, students and faculty observe religious holidays as a community, including important days on the American calendar, such as 9/11, Veterans Day, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day. One example of RZJHS' holiday celebrations is Purim, which is one of the highlights of each year. On Purim, RZJHS students begin celebration in school and then each grade volunteers around Chicago during the afternoon. The morning celebration features festive prayers, followed by video parodies, \\"Purim shpiels\\" created by students and faculty. In order to facilitate students‚Äô observance of the holidays, faculty is committed to limiting homework demands during certain seasons of the year. Holiday programs and celebrations are developed and run by the school Rabbi, \\"Rav Beit Sefer\\" and a committee of students and faculty.

History The Conde dynasty was founded in Madrid by Domingo Esteso in 1915. Esteso trained his nephews Faustino and Mariano Conde Sr. Later, the young Julio Conde joined his brothers. Domingo Esteso died in 1937, and after that time the three Conde Brothers continued working for Esteso's widow under the name of \\"Viuda y Sobrinos de Esteso\\" (Esteso's Widow and Nephews) until 1960. In the early 1950s, Julio Conde set up a new handicraft guitar center. From 1960 until 1988-89 they took over the shop and called themselves \\"Sobrinos de Domingo Esteso Conde Hermanos\\" (Esteso's Nephews, Conde Brothers) or \\"Hermanos Conde Sobrinos de Domingo Esteso\\" (Conde Brothers, Esteso's Nephews). Mariano Sr. later established his own shop close to the Royal Theatre, calling it \\"Conde Hermanos Sucesores Sobrinos de Esteso\\". His two sons, Felipe, born in 1957 and Mariano Jr., born 1959, began their apprenticeship with their father and uncle Faustino when they were about 15 years old. Faustino died in 1988 and Mariano Sr. in 1989. Felipe and Mariano Conde (sons of Mariano Conde Sr.) manufactured flamenco guitars in their workshop at Felipe V St. n¬∫ 2 in Madrid close to the Teatro Real (Royal Theatre) and the Palacio Real (Royal Palace). They were known as \\"Conde Hermanos Sucesores Sobrinos de Esteso\\" (Conde Brothers - Esteso's Nephews Successors) Felipe and Mariano have now broken off their business association. They work in different workshops and sell different models of guitars. Felipe Conde works with his son and daughter Felipe Jr. and Mar√≠a at his shop at Arrieta 4, in front of the Royal Theatre, close to the old shop. Mariano Conde works at his shop at Amnist√≠a 1, next to the Opera metro station.

He is a member of the British‚ÄìNorwegian pop group A1. Biography Ingebrigtsen was born in Oslo, Norway, into a musical family. His father Stein Ingebrigtsen was the biggest selling recording artist in Norway in the 1970s. At the age of three, Christian joined his father on tour. He learned to play the violin at six, and later started playing the piano and guitar. At school he concentrated on music and drama, and eventually played the piano at local events and at church. At 16 he started composing his own songs, and as an exchange student in Kentucky in the U.S. he participated in musicals, talent contests and held his own concerts. In 1995 he was given the state award Kentucky Colonel, something he shares with the likes of Bing Crosby, Colonel Sanders and Winston Churchill. In 1996 Ingebrigtsen got into the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA), where he studied song- writing and production. In 1998 he was one of 2500 auditioning for a new boyband. A teacher at LIPA recommended Ingebrigtsen to manager Tim Byrne working on putting together the group, and he became the third member of A1, who after becoming a quartet, signed a recording contract with Columbia Records in 1999. =A1= Christian Ingebrigtsen is part of A1 (stylised as a1), an English-Norwegian pop group that was formed in 1998. The line-up consists of Ingebrigtsen, Mark Read and Ben Adams. An original member and founder Paul Marazzi was a member from 1998 until his departure in 2002. Ingebrigtsen is the only Norwegian in A1, as all the other members originate from London, England. A1 released Here We Come in 1999, The A List in 2000 and Make It Good in 2002, the year Marazzi left the band citing personal reasons. The three remaining members subsequently decided to take a break. In December 2009, Ingebrigtsen, Read and Adams reformed A1, without Marazzi, for a series of concerts in Norway. Since their comeback, they have released their fourth and fifth studio albums, Waiting for Daylight, in 2010, and Rediscovered, in 2012. =Solo career= In 2003 Ingebrigtsen started his career as a solo artist. His debut was the duet \\"In Love with an Angel\\" with Maria Arredondo. The song became a hit, staying three months in the top 10 list of VG-Lista Topp 20 (Norway's official single chart). Ingebrigtsen wrote the song \\"True Friendship\\" for Arredondo's debut album. In May of the same year he made his debut as a solo performer with the song \\"Things Are Gonna Change\\". Ingebrigtsen had landed a recording contract with Universal Records and despite his fans in other countries from his A1-period, he chose to concentrate on the Norwegian market. The single went straight to number one on VG Lista Topp 20. \\"Take Back Yesterday\\" followed in November 2003. His debut solo album was released on 27 December 2003. Entitled Take Back Yesterday it was backed up by a television advertisement campaign. The album was mainly produced by, and the songs largely written by Ingebrigtsen. The album made its debut at number 6 on the official album chart, VG Lista Topp 40, climbed to number 2 and stayed on as one of the ten best selling albums for two months. \\"In Love with an Angel\\" was nominated as Song of the Year for Spellemannprisen (Norwegian Grammys), but lost to World Idol winner Kurt Nilsen's \\"She's So High\\". The third single from the album, \\"Can't Give Up\\", was released in March 2004. In 2006 Ingebrigtsen released a Christmas album for the Norwegian Salvation Army. Paint Christmas White was recorded with the Czech National Symphony Orchestra and was certified gold in Norway. The album included two self-penned songs; the title track \\"Paint Christmas White\\" and the track \\"Angels in the Snow\\". In 2007 Ingebrigtsen released the album The Truth About Lies, including the singles, \\"Adorable\\" and \\"Learn to Fly\\", both getting considerable radio play in Norway, with \\"Adorable\\" reaching the number 1 on Norsktoppen. In 2009 Christian played the role of Marius in the Norwegian production of Les Mis√©rables in Oslo Nye Teater. He has also co-written six entries in the Melodi Grand Prix, three of which came second, \\"Eastern Wind\\" written for Torstein S√∏dal, \\"Somewhere Beautiful\\" sung by Nora Foss al-Jabri and \\"Don't Wanna Lose You Again\\" sang by him and his band A1. The fourth song was \\"Sweeter Than a Kiss\\" sung by Charite. His most recent entry, \\"Attention\\" by Ulrikke, won Melodi Grand Prix 2020. He also wrote the song \\"Perfect Villain\\" performed by Zuhlke in Finland, also finishing 2nd place in the competition there.

Features  CVSNT keeps track of the version history of a project (or set of files). CVSNT is based on the same client‚Äìserver architecture as the Concurrent Versions System: a server stores the current version(s) of the project and its history, and clients connect to the server in order to check- out a complete copy of the project, work on this copy and then later check-in their changes. A server may be a caching or proxy server (a read only server that passes on write requests to another server) or a read and write (normal) server. Typically, client and server connect over a WAN or Internet, but client and server may both run on the same LAN or even the same machine. The server software runs equally well on Unix and Windows. It is compatible with CVS clients and supports a large number of configuration management methodologies including the CVS compatible unreserved method and the VSS-like reserved method. The modular nature of CVSNT allows server administrators to dynamically enable and disable protocols as well as load additional functions via triggers such as Audit, Defect Tracking Integration, Automatic Checkout (for webservers) and more. CVSNT Server features include: * Access control for securing projects and branches. * Detailed audit and metrics recorded in an SQL database. * Authentication with Active Directory. * Tracking everything about the change - including whether it was merged from somewhere, belongs to a problem report or was part of a change set. * A control panel to manage email notification of changes, defect tracking integration, and more. * Integrated repository synchronisation (for fail-over servers). * Change set support (group changes by defect number). * Supports Unicode UTF-8/UCS-2 files and multi-lingual filenames. * When operating in UTF-8 (Unicode) mode it can automatically translate filename encoding for any client. * Plug-ins for email notification. * Helps make merging branches easier with its \\"Mergepoint\\" feature. * Native servers available for Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, Solaris, HP- UX. * Supports reserved and unreserved versioning methodologies. * CVSAPI for integration into third-party products. * Script, COM and 3GL interface for triggers and integration into 3rd party tools (such as defect tracking)  History and status  Users unhappy with the limitations of CVS 1.10.8 began the development of CVSNT. The original limitations addressed were related to running CVS server on Windows and handling filenames for case-insensitive platforms. The first version was released in 1998, and stable feature releases have been released roughly every three to four months since. Linux and Unix support was re-added to CVSNT in early 2002. From the project's inception until October 2002 CVSNT and CVS used identical version numbers and CVSNT was \\"kept in sync\\" with the features and code base of CVS. After October 2002, CVSNT began its own version sequence beginning with \\"2\\" to indicate significant departure from its CVS origins. Since that time, there has not been a stable feature release of CVS. However the unstable CVS 1.12 contains some of the oldest features originally implemented in CVSNT. Due to this shared history, all features from CVS 1.11 are included in CVSNT and most from CVS 1.12 (e.g.: the 1.12 'ls' feature is functionally compatible with the CVSNT 'ls'). In 2003, the CVSNT SJIS project released a Japanese version of CVSNT including support for SJIS filenames and file encoding. March Hare Software began sponsorship of the project in July 2004 to guarantee the project's future and to employ the original project manager on CVSNT development and commercial support. In February 2005, the project servers moved to CVSNT version 2.5 and began unstable releases of a new server incorporating server plugins, ACLs, filename character set conversion as well as client/server autodiscovery. In October 2005, the first commercial CVS Suite was released, incorporating non-GPL addins and clients for CVSNT. In November 2005, CVSNT was enhanced to incorporate the features of the CVSNT SJIS project. In March 2006, the project servers moved to CVSNT version 2.6 and began unstable releases of the new server backend. This backend incorporated a partial SQL database repository to facilitate better server performance and more complex server features. When work was abandoned on CVSNT 2.6 and moved to EVS/CVSNT 3.1 the project server was moved back to 2.5.04. In November 2008 the project released version 2.5.04 with support for multi site repository replication or 'local' repository caches and specific performance features for using large files use over a WAN. The project began advertising for contributors more aggressively including placing advertising in commit comments (which can be turned off). Note: Although March-Hare's site gives 'instructions' for disabling the advertising messages, it has been documented that the method given does not work for release 2.5.04. In March 2010 the project released version 2.5.05 with a server that always runs in Unicode, native Windows crypt and schannel support and support for Internationalized Domain Names. The open source CVSNT project does not have a \\"project charter\\". This was a decision based on the observation that the charter prevented the CVS project from evolving CVS into a versioning system supporting modern CM best practice. The CVSNT project will continue to evolve the software as the scope of version management and CM changes, including changes to expand the supported methodologies. The status of the project is active, with further releases of CVSNT 2.5 planned, and continuing evolution of CVSNT/EVS 3.1. CVSNT/EVS will implement a complete SQL database repository to support further complex server and client features. An RCS emulation layer is also planned for CVSNT/EVS 3.1 to support legacy systems. On June 30, 2010, March Hare retired the zero-dollar Community edition, however the commercial \\"CVS Suite\\" edition with a new CVSNT 2.8 release and support is actively developed and available from the web store, as are snapshots of the older community releases (unsupported, and a fee is required to download). Email support is available for customers but the community mailing list/newsgroup has been removed. The description of the public CVS server for source code was updated with the caveat \\"not guaranteed to be available 24x7, is provided by a volunteer and may be withdrawn at any time\\". This arrangement appears to fulfil the requirements of the GPL, since the software offered for download includes a written offer to receive the source code, as is explicitly required by the license. Older versions can still be downloaded for free from various repositories,packages in Ubuntupackages in Debian or,rpm packages in rpmfind including source code.  Embedded  To many people CVSNT is best known because it has been embedded in a 3rd party systems. Software incorporating CVSNT includes: * TortoiseCVS recommend CVSNT for both Unix and Windows machines. * WinCVS was developed in close cooperation with CVSNT project. * VP/MS  Future roadmap  March Hare plans to deliver the following features in the next release : * Atomic Commits * Database backend (no more Revision Control System (RCS) files) * RCS \\"interface\\" for legacy integrating  See also  * Version control system, general overview * CVSNT was originally forked from Concurrent Versions System (CVS) in 2004 * List of revision control software * Comparison of revision control software External links * CVSNT Home Page - GPL licensed CVS implementation with a server and client for many platforms including Microsoft Windows and Linux. * EVS Home Page - LGPL licensed CVS implementation with a server and client for many platforms including Microsoft Windows and Linux. * March Hare's CVSNT FAQ * AnandTech How to Set up a Source Control on Windows. * AVAJAVA CVSNT and Eclipse setup guide. * CVSNT Legacy Home Page - CVSNT Legacy client/server tools v2.5.05 for Microsoft Windows.

The nearest major town is Glenrothes located 4 miles to the south. The name derives from the Scottish Gaelic, fraoch, meaning heather. This Fife village is not to be confused with the old location of the same name in Morayshire (now in the Highland Council Area) upon which the new town of Grantown was built in the 18th century. Freuchie was once used by the Royal family as a place of banishment from the Court when it was in nearby Falkland Palace.

Another aphoristic usage occurs in the phrase \\"as Scots as Freuchie\\",For example, see Donati (ed).

Freuchie Cricket Club is best known for having won the village cricket championships at Lord's in 1985. This is considered particularly unusual as Scottish teams are not generally prominent in the game. On 13 August 2008, a number of locations throughout the village were affected by flooding, resulting in damage to homes and cars being written off by insurance companies.

The Argentinisches Tageblatt was one of the many newspapers banned by the Nazis during the period of the Third Reich. Possession of the paper was forbidden throughout the territory of the Third Reich while Hitler was in power, due to the progressive stance adopted by editor-in-chief Ernesto Alemann. After the military coup of 1976 the publication supported the new authorities. An editorial called for \\"night and fog actions\\" in which opponents of the regime should disappear.Horacio Verbitsky: El pa√≠s: Genocidios, P√°gina/12, 2012-06-03. Roberto Alemann, the son of the publisher, was appointed minister for economy by the military and was thus part of the regime, under which 30,000 people died between 1976 and 1983. Roberto Alemann has been running the Tageblatt since the death of Ernesto Alemann in 1982. References * Sebastian Sch√∂pp: Das 'Argentinische Tageblatt' 1933 bis 1945.

She is one of the fierce forms of the Great Goddess Shakti or Adi Parashakti (also called Durga, Devi, Mahadevi, or Mahamaya) mentioned in the Devi Mahatmyam. Bhadrakali is a popular form of the Great Goddess, worshipped in Kerala as Bhadrakali, Mahakali, Chamunda and Kariam Kali Murti. In Kerala she is seen as the auspicious and fortunate form of Mahakali who protects the good. This goddess is represented with three eyes, and four, sixteen, or eighteen hands. She carries a number of weapons, with flames flowing from her head, and a small tusk protruding from her mouth. Her worship is also associated with the Tantric tradition of the Matrikas as well as the tradition of the ten Mahavidyas and falls under the broader umbrella of Shaktism. Sarkara, Kodungalloor, Aattukal, Chettikulangara, Thirumandhamkunnu and Chottanikkara are famous Bhadrakali temples in Kerala.Mandaikadu, Kollencode are famous temples in Tamil Nadu Bhadrakali is primarily worshipped in 4 forms: Darukajit (as the killer of the demon Darika), Dakshajit (as the killer of Daksha), Rurujit (as the slayer of the demon Ruru) and as Mahishajit (as She who killed Mahishasura). Etymology In Sanskrit, Bhadra means Decent. A major religious interpretation of this name is that Bhadra comes from 'Bha' and 'dra', The letter 'Bha' means 'delusion' or 'Maya'and 'dra' is used as a superlative i.e. meaning 'the most/the greatest etc.' which makes the meaning of Bhadra as Maha Maya. The Sanskrit word 'Bhadra Kaali' therefore can be translated to Hindi as 'Mahamaya Kaali'. Origins There are at least five traditional versions regarding the origin-incarnations or avatar of Bhadrakali: = The Slaying of Darika = In Kerala, where the worship of Bhadrakali is prevalent even today, she is worshipped most commonly as \\"Darikajit,\\" the slayer of Darika, based on a story that originated in the Markandeya Purana, and is called the \\"Bhadrakali Mahatmyam\\" or \\"Darika- vadham\\". The asura Darika was said to have a very chaste wife, Manodari, who had in her possession a special mantra that would keep her husband invincible, and thus her marriage forever safe. Darika used his newfound invincibility to torment the lokas and usurp the kingdom of the Devas. When Lord Shiva came to know about the misdeeds of demon Darika, he opened his fiery third eye and the massive ferocious form of Bhadrakali emerged (In this incarnation, the Goddess was not his wife, but her daughter.) Shiva ordered Bhadrakali to destroy Darika, with a Vetala as her vehicle. However the Goddess found it impossible to kill the demon as he was ever in the protection of his wife's mantra chanting. The Goddess split her form into that of her fierce warrior self that continued to engage in combat and that of a common woman. The Goddess went to Manodari, claiming to be the wife of a soldier who was fighting for Darika in his army in the losing battle. With this, Manodari broke her chanting to console the worried woman, breaking Darika's broke invincibility shield. Kali immediately disappeared from Manodari's presence while on the battlefield she had already managed to injure Darika. As Darika lay at her feet, about to be killed, he was said to have appealed to her motherly nature as a last resort, with faux praises and prayers. But the Devas gathered there began to sing praises to the Goddess (such as the mantra \\"Kante Kalatmaje Kaali, Kante Kali Namostute\\"), thus reminding the Goddess of the atrocities Darika had committed that caused her birth in the first place. Turning a blind eye to Darika's faux innocence, Bhadrakali severed his head and held it aloft in her left hand as she danced around in the battlefield. But her anger would not succumb and so the Devas invoked Lord Shiva to intervene and calm Kali down, as when in anger Kali had the tendency to reduce the universe into nothingness. Shiva lay in her path as a crying baby and this time (Gandakarna), Kali's true motherliness was awakened. A now calm Kali expressed her wish to stay at the spot and protect the local people till the end of time. The spot where she remained is said to be the Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple. Bhadrakali at Kodungallur still remains one of her 3 most auspicious temples in Kerala, along with Thirumandhamkunnu Temple and Parumala Valiya Panayannarkavu Devi Temple. It is also listed as one of the 13 'kaavu' temples of Kali and as one of the main 64 Bhadrakali temples in Kerala. = Chamundi = Another version of the Bhadrakali story is from the Devi Mahatmyam of the Markandeya Purana, during the battle between Raktabija and Goddess Kaushiki (Durga). Kali was born from the wrath of Goddess Kaushiki, from her forehead. She slew Chanda & Munda and earned the epithet 'Chamundi'. She also slayed the demon Raktabija, which is her most famous feat. This Chamundi-Kali form is said to be the leader of the Sapta-Matrikas and is the most popular form of the Goddess in Northern India. = Daksha's Yajna = Another popular story on Bhadrakali is associated with Daksha and his yajna, according to the Shiva Purana, Vayu Purana and the Mahabharata. Goddess Bhadrakali was born from the matted locks of Shiva's hair. He ordered her to free Veerabhadra who was imprisoned by Lord Vishnu, as the latter was protecting Daksha. She succeeds and is later heard of as assisting in Daksha's assassination, and hence earned the title 'Dakshajit'. = Mahishasura Mardini = According to the Kalika Purana, Bhadrakali is said to have appeared in Treta yuga to slay the 2nd out of the 4 Mahishasuras. It is believed that when the 3rd Mahishasura wished to know how he would die, he was given a vision of the fair-skinned Bhadrakali who rose out of the milky ocean and slew him in his previous incarnation. He asked to die again at her hands and the Goddess promised that she would incarnate as the 18 armed Mahishasura Mardini (the account detailed in the Devi Mahatmyam) and slay him. This version of Bhadrakali is worshiped as 'Mahishajit'. = Slayer of Ruru = According to the Varaha Purana, the Goddess Roudri (incarnation of mother Parvati) was meditating at the foot of the Neeli mountain. She came across the Devas who were fleeing, unable to bear the atrocities of the demon Ruru. Angered by the injustice she witnessed, Roudri created Bhadrakali from the embers of her rage and sent her to kill Ruru. Bhadrakali successfully did so and was awarded the epithet 'Rurujit'. = The Many Forms of Devi = According to Tantra Rahasya, the feminine form of the divine (Devi) arose from the North (Uttaramnaya) face (Amnayas) of Shiva, which is blue in color and with three eyes, as Dakshinakalika, Mahakali, Guhyakah, Smashanakalika, Bhadrakali, Ekajata, Ugratara, Taritni, Katyayani, Chhinnamasta, Nilasarasvati, Durga, Jayadurga, Navadurga, Vashuli, Dhumavati, Vishalakshi, Gauri, Bagalamukhi, Pratyangira, Matangi, and Mahishamardini.Shakti and Sh√¢kta by Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodroffe), [1918], Chapter Six Shakti and Shakta. \\"4) The face in the North is blue in color and with three eyes. By this face, I revealed the Devis, Dakshinakalika, Mahakali, Guhyakah, Smashanakalika, Bhadrakali, Ekajata, Ugratara, Taritni, Katyayani, Chhinnamasta, Nilasarasvati, Durga, Jayadurga, Navadurga, Vashuli, Dhumavati, Vishalakshi, Gauri, Bagalamukhi, Pratyangira, Matangi, Mahishamardini, their rites and Mantras.\\" Various traditions and forms of worship According to the Kerala traditions, the events described in the Markandeya Purana associated with Bhadrakali (her slaying of the demon Darika to liberate the universe from the evil) took place in Kerala, near Madayi in the Kannur District.Maha Kshethrangalude Munnil, D. C. Books, Kerala Bhadrakali temples in Kerala commemorate this event during traditional festivals and Bhadrakali is worshipped as the daughter of Lord Shiva, from whose third eye she sprung to defeat the demon. According to the Markandeya Purana, her worship purifies the devotee and grants liberation from the cycle of birth and death.Markandeya Purana She is seen to protect the honour of women and to bestow all spiritual knowledge. In Kerala, she called Virabhadra her \\"brother\\" and refused to be treated by him when she was attacked by the deity Vasoorimala, who had marked her face with smallpox. She said that a brother must not touch the face of his sister. Thus, mild pockmarks are sometimes visible on her face in some Keralan depictions of her.the Horse-worship of the Prajapati Daksha The Mahabharata translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli (1883 -1896), Book 12: Santi Parva: Mokshadharma Parva: Section CCLXXXIV. p. 317. \\"I am known by the name of Virabhadra‚Äô‚Äô and I have sprung from the wrath of Rudra. This lady (who is my companion), and who is called Bhadrakali, hath sprung from the wrath of the goddess.\\"Purana Among the people of the neighboring states, especially in Tamil Nadu, this form of Shakti is known as 'Malayala Bhagavathy' or 'Malayala Bhadrakali', who provides protection to her devotees irrespective of caste and religion. In Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and the Southern Travancore area of Kerala, especially in the city of Thiruvananthapuram, the Tamil, Kannada and Telugu speaking communities worship a form of Mahakali as 'Ujjaini Mahakali', and they consider Emperor Vikramaditya as their first teacher in this spiritual tradition as having established the tradition in the South. In other parts of India, the Tantric name 'Kali' or 'Mahakali' is generally more popular as the consort of Shiva in his form of Rudra or Mahakala, and Bhadrakali is identified as Durga's daughter who helped her during the battle with Raktabija. Other sources state that she is the sister of Virabhadra, who was himself born of the wrath of Shiva as Rudra, and that she is the consort of a form of Mahakala or Bhairava. The deeply Tantric-influenced traditions mostly consider 'Kali' as the consort of Shiva. Goddess Bhadrakali, gouache on paper (ca. 1660‚Äì70)  Martial arts and Bhadrakali  It is believed Bhadrakali protects the practitioners of Kalarippayattu, a traditional martial arts form. In Malabar, it is believed that all the victories of Thacholi Othenan and other martial artists were due to the blessings of Bhadrakali of the Lokanarkavu Temple, also known as 'The Shaolin Temple of Malayalees'. Most traditional villages in Kerala have their own Kalari, the ancient martial arts schools and local temples dedicated to Bhadrakali associated with them. Among Tamils, Bhadrakali is equally important as the patron deity of traditional martial arts and a guardian of all law-abiding citizens. Family deity of communities Some communities, like the Kodavas, Thiyyar's, Poojaris, Billavas, Thlulu Thiyyars, Namboodhiri and Moosathu Brahmins and some Kurup Nairs, worship this deity as family deity. They worship certain weapons at their temples which they believe to be the weapons used by the goddess. The Kuladevata or community deity of Kudumbi community is Kodungalluramma, the mother goddess of kodungallur. Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple is one of the most famous temples in Kerala, dedicated to Bhadrakali. During the 'thalappoli' festival, which is celebrated mainly on Makar Sankranti, kudumbi people from all over the state (mainly Malabar, Thlunad, Kodaka. Thiyyar's many temples in Northern Kerala and Karnataka they are called the Kali Sree kurumba, Cheermba, ParaDevatha ... ... etc..and they have the tradition 2500 more years) come to the temple. According to Nadar Community of Tamilnadu, The Seven Children born for devarishis and Devakannis. They gave their children to bhadrakali.She took up and gave milk to children.The progenies of these children are today nadar community .She is the mother of Nadars. The Nadars also claim that they are the descendants of Bhadrakali. A Bhadrakali temple is usually at the centre of almost every Nadar settlement.Bhadrakali is also the tutelary deity of the Nadar community of Tamil Nadu. Kanyakubja Brahmins with roots in Bhadras, Kanpur worship her as Kuldevi. It is called Bhadras because of the presence of a very old Bhadra Kali Temple.  Kaalidasa and Vikramaditya  According to legends, the famous Indian Sanskrit poet Kalidasa became what he was thanks to the divine will of Bhadrakali. Another legend states that the emperor Vikramaditya and his brother Bhatti were also ardent devotees of Bhadrakali, whose blessings resulted in all the success showered upon them. Vikramaditya also helped to establish small wayside Bhadrakali temples and prayer centers for pilgrims in many parts of Southern India, especially in Tamil Nadu. The devotional traditions focused around these small temples exist even today.Ujjaini Mahakali Ammanin Varalaru, Mahatmyam Folk Art ritual of Kerala and Bhadrakali Murti of Bhadrakali in Madurai Meenakshi Temple Kerala has a tradition of folk artist rituals and dances associated with worship of Devi in the form of Bhadrakali. These rituals are performed in places of worship called Kavu (roughly translated as grove) or in small temples. Besides the general welfare of the village, these rituals aim at warding off of such calamities like smallpox and other epidemic diseases. The ritual themes generally revolve around the triumph of Bhadrakali over the demon Darika and other evil characters.

Early life T√©taz is of Swiss descent. He grew up in a musical family on a dairy farm near Warrion, in the western district of Victoria. His mother, Heather was a music teacher; his father Frank was a dairy farmer and was obsessed with sound and music. In the 1950s he designed and built speakers to broadcast music around the farm, herding cattle to a soundtrack of Brahms and Beethoven. The family moved to Geelong so Franc and his brother Charles could attend Geelong Grammar School. Early years After finishing school, he worked in Faggs hardware store in Geelong. Graeme Leak, who was artist in residence at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music at the time, suggested to Franc that he not go to university, but put together his own curriculum. While working, he sat in on a friend's university lectures and studied West African Music, percussion, arranging and orchestration. In 1992, Fran√ßois T√©taz with Charles T√©taz and Darrin Verhagen formed Shinjuku Thief, a Melbourne-based industrial and experimental music group. Note: [on- line] version established at White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd in 2007 and was expanded from the 2002 edition. They released four albums by March 1994. Verhagen formed the record label, Dorobo Records, to release their latter albums including T√©taz' solo album, The Motionless World of Time Between or the Drunken Taxicab of Absolute Reality in 1997. He scored student short films, worked on production for Paul McDermott, and The Doug Anthony Allstars.

Reichardt's dye dissolved in different solvents The solvatochromic effect is the way the spectrum of a substance (the solute) varies when the substance is dissolved in a variety of solvents. In this context, the dielectric constant and hydrogen bonding capacity are the most important properties of the solvent. With various solvents there is a different effect on the electronic ground state and excited state of the solute, so that the size of energy gap between them changes as the solvent changes. This is reflected in the absorption or emission spectrum of the solute as differences in the position, intensity, and shape of the spectroscopic bands. When the spectroscopic band occurs in the visible part of the spectrum solvatochromism is observed as a change of colour. This is illustrated by Reichardt's dye, as shown at the right. Negative solvatochromism corresponds to a hypsochromic shift (or blue shift) with increasing solvent polarity. An examples of negative solvatochromism is provided by 4-(4‚Ä≤-hydroxystyryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide, which is red in 1-propanol, orange in methanol, and yellow in water. Positive solvatochromism corresponds to a bathochromic shift (or red shift) with increasing solvent polarity. An example of positive solvatochromism is provided by 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)fuchsone, which is orange in toluene, red in acetone. The main value of the concept of solvatochromism is the context it provides to predict colors of solutions. Solvatochromism can in principle be used in sensors and in molecular electronics for construction of molecular switches. Solvatochromic dyes are used to measure solvent parameters, which can be used to explain solubility phenomena and predict suitable solvents for particular uses. Solvatochromism of the photoluminescence/fluorescence of carbon nanotubes has been identified and used for optical sensor applications. In one such application, the wavelength of the fluorescence of peptide-coated carbon nanotubes was found to change when exposed to explosives, facilitating detection. However, more recently the small chromophore solvatochromism hypothesis has been challenged for carbon nanotubes in light of older and newer data showing electrochromic behavior. These and other observations regarding non-linear processes on the semiconducting nanotube suggest colloidal models will require new interpretations that are in line with classic semiconductor optical processes, including electrochemical processes, rather than small molecule physical descriptions. Conflicting hypotheses may be due to the fact the nanotube is only a single atom thick material interface unlike other \\"bulk\\" nanomaterials.

Campbell was primarily interested in rhetoric, since he believed that its study would enable his students to become better preachers. He became a philosopher of rhetoric because he took it that the philosophical changes of the Age of Enlightenment would have implications for rhetoric. Life, times, and influences Campbell was born on 25 December 1719 in Aberdeen (it is unlikely that there was much significance given to his birth date, since Scottish Calvinists, such as Campbell's father, Rev. Colin Campbell, despised both popish rituals and holidays). At the age of fifteen, Campbell attended Marischal College where he studied logic, metaphysics, pneumatology (philosophy of mind and/or spirit), ethics, and natural philosophy. After graduating with his M.A. in 1738, Campbell decided to study law and served as an apprentice to a writer to the Signet in Edinburgh. He began gravitating towards theology after attending lectures at the University of Edinburgh. After serving out his term as an apprentice, he returned to Aberdeen and enrolled at both King's and Marischal Colleges, University of Aberdeen as a student of divinity. Because of the tumultuous political landscape in Scotland (see Jacobite rising of 1745), Campbell's divinity examinations were delayed until 1746 when he received his licence to preach. Within two years, he received ordination at the parish of Banchory Ternan. The origin of Campbell's scholarly career can be traced back to his years at the parish. He established himself as a scripture critic, and lecturer of holy writ. Campbell began his lifelong ambition of translating the gospels, and around 1750, he composed the first two chapters of The Philosophy of Rhetoric. Campbell's growing reputation impressed the magistrates of the city of Aberdeen and he was offered a ministerial position in 1757. His return brought him to the core of the growing intellectual community in northeast Scotland. In 1759, Campbell was offered the position of principal at Marischal College and he fully immersed himself in university affairs. During his time at Marischal, Campbell was a founding member of the Aberdeen Philosophical Society along with philosopher Thomas Reid, John Gregory (mediciner), David Skene, John Stewart and Robert Trail. Many members of the Society, including Reid, Campbell, and Gregory, were great admirers of Francis Bacon, so the group's aim directed toward the exploration of the sciences of the mind. The Aberdeen Philosophical Society is most often remembered for its philosophical publications, notably: Reid's Inquiry into the Human mind, on the Principles of Common Sense (1764), James Beattie's Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth (1770), and Alexander Gerard' Essay on Genius. Campbell's work was very much influenced by the group's members. The Philosophy of Rhetoric was originally read in discourses before this Society. Campbell's emphasis on the trustworthiness of the senses and his exploration of tendencies basic to human nature have been attributed to the influence of his colleague in the society, the common sense philosopher, Thomas Reid. Campbell's first major publication, A Dissertation in Miracles (1762), was directed against David Hume's attack on miracles in An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding. Campbell was influenced by Hume, but took particular issue with his philosophical strictures. Even though both were in complete opposition over almost every point of philosophy, Campbell and Hume shared a mutual respect. Thanks in part to the success of Miracles, Campbell became a professor of divinity at Marischal in 1770. He lectured to students to prepare them for the demands of the ministry, both practical and spiritual. Campbell gave lectures on Church history, later published as Lectures on Ecclesiastical History, and on pastoral character and preaching, later published as Lectures on Pulpit Eloquence. After completing The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1776), Campbell published several sermons and finished his lifelong ambition, The Four Gospels, Translated from the Greek (1789). In December 1793 he was a founder member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Campbell continued lecturing until ill health forced him into retirement in 1795 and he died on 6 April 1796. He is buried in St Nicholas Churchyard in Aberdeen. Campbell's Theory of Moral Reasoning George Campbell ascertained that the human mind is separated into various faculties that serve the purpose of dictating moral reasoning. To his reasoning moral reasoning was a hierarchal system initiated by individual understanding of a given situation and moves on through imagination and personal desire. Campbell was clear that there were seven circumstances involved in a person's decision to act on their impulses as described by The Rhetoric of Western Thought. The first is probability, the second is plausibility, the third is importance, the fourth is proximity of time, the fifth is connection, the sixth is relation, and the last is interest in the consequences. All of which play a major role in the manner in which a person operates. Legacy =Campbell as an enlightened thinker= While Campbell's literary life was dominated by pedagogical and pastoral concerns, it is apparent that his mind was tempered by the values of the Enlightenment. Campbell believed that the Enlightenment was the ally to a moderate, rational, and practical Christianity, rather than a threat. His faith required that his religious evidences to be complete while his enlightened thinking required faith to give it purpose. Throughout Campbell's literary career, he focused on enlightened concerns such as rhetoric, taste, and genius‚Äîperhaps a result of his time in the Aberdeen Philosophical Society. His attempt to align rhetoric within the sphere of psychology resulted from Francis Bacon's survey of the structure and purpose of knowledge. The Philosophy of Rhetoric illustrates the Baconian influence of inductive methodology but also scientific investigation‚Äîtwo major concerns of the Enlightenment. As well, Campbell's appeal to natural evidences was a similarity in process shared by most of the great minds of the Enlightenment. This is seen throughout his writing, with particular emphasis on placing methodology before doctrine, critical inquiry before judgment, and his application of tolerance, moderation, and improvement. =Campbell and faculty psychology= Campbell embraced the philosophical empiricism which John Locke established in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. Following the example of Locke's humanistic sciences, Campbell set forth an analysis of rhetoric through the scope of mental faculties. He believed that a rhetoric grounded in empiricism would become efficient because of the incorporation of the cognitive processes. The human senses are the basis for the validity of belief; thus a rhetorical theory based in faculty psychology would establish that rhetoric is capable of making a reader experience a concept with the same \\"vivacity\\" and automaticity as that of the senses. Campbell, like most theorists of the Enlightenment, believed in a universal human nature: the \\"general principles [of taste] are the same in every people\\".Philosophy of Rhetoric, Harper, 1849 (1776), p. 441. He gives the example of tropes and figuration which \\"are so far from being the inventions of art, that, on the contrary, they result from the original and essential principles of the human mind\\". This facet of human nature has remained constant throughout history so it must be universal trait. Based on premises similar to this, Campbell claimed that human beings act according to clear and obvious motives and rhetoric should be, in turn, directed towards similar operations of the mind. To persuade effectively, Campbell believed that the orator should adapt his or her discourse to the needs of the audience, for as he states: \\"whatever be the ultimate intention of the orator, to inform, to convince, to please, to move, or to persuade, still he must speak so as to be understood, or he speaks to no purpose\\". He classifies the needs of the audience into four different categories: :*Understanding: Elucidating a subject by explanation and proof :*Imagination: Exciting admiration by style, resemblance, detail, and sublimity :*Passions: Involving, motivating, associating images :*Will: Persuading to action by combining argumentation with vivacity The purpose of discourse is derived from the powers of the mind to which they appeal (understanding, imagination, passions, will), rather than the classical three, which are based on the public purpose of oration. The classical categories (see Cicero and Quintilian) are the demonstrative, to praise or blame; the deliberative, to advise or dissuade; and the forensic, to accuse or defend. In considering each of these, Campbell believes that not only understanding and memory of the audience must be taken into account, but the orator must as well provide particular attention at stimulating their passions. To incorporate this was as an obvious concern for Campbell, who believed that effective preaching must be measured by its effects on the audience. =Campbell and evidence= To move an audience, Campbell believed that a rhetorician must appreciate the relationship between evidence and human nature. Campbell divided evidence into two major types: intuitive and deductive. Intuitive evidence is convincing by its mere appearance. Its effect on the power of judgment is \\"natural, original, and unaccountable\\", which suggests that no other additional evidences can make it more compelling or effective. Campbell subdivides intuitive evidence into three sources: abstraction, consciousness, and common sense. These are responsible for our understanding of metaphysical, physical, and moral truths. Deductive evidence, unlike intuitive, is not immediately perceived. It must be demonstrated either logically or factually since it is not derived by premises but with comparing ideas. Deductive evidence originates from one of two sources: demonstrative or moral. Demonstrative concerns itself with abstract and invariable relations of ideas; moral, on the other hand, is concerned only with matters of fact. Campbell had the idea of both moral and scientific reasoning. In his book, The Philosophy of Rhetoric, the philosopher states four types of evidence that goes into reasoning. The first one is that reasoning comes from experience and how past experiences shape our sense of reason for present, and future reasoning. The second type of evidence is analogy, to analyze a situation we are able to get more of an understanding and view what needs to be done in the future to better an outcome. The third type of evidence is testimony. Testimony has to deal with written or oral communication. The very last is calculations of chances. Knowing that chance is not predictable a person can assume and use reason when it comes to other certain types of happenings. =Campbell's critique of Aristotle= Campbell believed that Aristotle's syllogistic method is faulty for four reasons: :# It is offered as a method of discovery when at best it is a way to present ideas; :# Even in mathematics or as a method of presentation, it is not efficient or effective since its formal rules do not guarantee validity; :# Even if it is only used as a method of reasoning, a syllogism is not very useful because it leads one to discover what is obvious from the first premise, because the syllogism will most likely assume the point in question; :# Even if they will sometimes guard the mind against an oversight, syllogisms often also mislead and are hardly the most effective check against carelessness. =Campbell and Hume= In David Hume's essay, Of Miracles, he assesses the credibility of testimony for miracles, and claims that our acceptance of it is based on experience; thus when testimony goes against the evidence of experience, it is a likely reason to reject the testimony. In response, Campbell published A Dissertation on Miracles to refute Hume's essay. He believed that Hume misrepresented the importance of testimony in attaining knowledge. Our faith in the representation of others is an original component in human nature. As proof, Campbell provides the example of children who readily accept the testimony of others. It is not until they get older and become sceptical that testimony is rejected; proof that our trust in witnesses precedes that of experience. For Campbell, the belief of testimony is part of human nature, since it is an unlearned and automatic response. Testimony is thus closer to evidence from consciousness than that from experience. Campbell argues that the most important factor in determining the authenticity of testimony is the number of witnesses. Numerous witnesses and no evidence of collusion will supersede all other factors, since the likelihood of testimony outweighs that of Hume's formula for determining the balance of probabilities. According to Campbell, Hume is wrong to claim that testimony is a weakened type of evidence; it is capable of providing absolute certainty even with the most miraculous event. Works =Writing= * A Dissertation on Miracles (1762) :A somewhat belated response to David Hume's essay, Of Miracles (1748). Within the widely debated discussion on miracles, Campbell establishes a relationship between reason and faith. He explains that a miracle is necessary to conversion, that miracles are important and should not be readily dismissed, and that the sceptical cannot reason their way to faith. * The Philosophy of Rhetoric **Book I: \\"The Nature and Foundations of Eloquence\\". Campbell attempts to clarify the theoretical understanding of classical rhetoric. He draws upon empiricist philosophy for deriving belief in the audience and on faculty psychology to establish the motives of the audience. **Book II: \\"The Foundations and Essential Properties of Elocution\\". A philosophy of language and prescriptions for its usage. Campbell argues for a standard usage of language; favouring national over local, present over past, and reputable sources over common. **Book III: \\"The Discriminating Properties of Elocution\\". Campbell's views on style and an analysis of vivacity. * The Four Gospels (1789) :Campbell regarded this as the greatest work of his life: a 1,500 page translation of the Four Gospels. Along with the translation, it includes critical dissertations on the problems of translating and interpreting the ancient texts, as well as his observations on the translations themselves. * Campbell, George, The Philosophy of Rhetoric, New York 1841. Facsimile ed., 1992. Scholars' Facsimiles & Reprints, . =Sermons and lectures= Campbell's sermons and lectures provide important insights into the structure of his thought and range of his scholarly activities. * \\"The Spirit of the Gospel: A Spirit neither of Superstition nor of Enthusiasm\\" (1771) :Campbell attempts to defend the character of Christ against attacks from the outside the church and against the dangers of misguided Christians within. He argues, against the critics of religion, that true Christianity is not characterised by fearful superstition or by merciless indoctrination. * \\"The Nature, Extent, and Importance of Duty of Allegiance\\" (1777) :Argues that rebellion is unreasonable and without scriptural warrant. True liberty can only be found within the rule of law. * \\"The Success of the First Publishers of the Gospel: A Proof of its Truth\\" (1777) :Campbell argues that the situation of the world, during the early years of Christianity, was so utterly inhospitable that Christianity's success can only be explained by supernatural means. * \\"The Happy Influence of Religion on Civil Society\\" (1779) :Campbell argues that religion is necessary for civil order and happiness because it provides moral sanctions that political laws cannot. * \\"An Address to the People of Scotland upon the Alarms that Have Been Raised in Regard to Popery\\" (1779) :Campbell demonstrates, from both scripture and reason, that persecution in all its forms is both wrong and ineffective. He refuted claims that Catholics threatened national security and sought to overrun Britain. * Lectures on Ecclesiastical History (Posthumous, 1800) :The first part of Campbell's divinity course at Marischal College; they are topical arguments designed to illustrate certain historical tendencies in the development of the church. The lectures focus on the growth and domination of the hierarchical form of ecclesiastical government. There was nothing particularly new in Campbell's analysis, except his use of psychological explanations. * Lectures on Systematic Theology and Pulpit Eloquence (posthumous, 1807) :Campbell underlines a systematic methodology for studying scripture, the evidences of religion, and for forming a system of Christian morality. Their purpose was to prevent divinity students from accepting a fixed view of Christianity. * Lectures on the Pastoral Character (Posthumous, 1811) :Practical lectures which give advice to prospective ministers on particular virtues to cultivate and vices to avoid.

St. David CSS is located in Waterloo, Ontario and is a member of the Waterloo Catholic District School Board. Its building is the oldest secondary school building in the board. Historically it was a junior high school, instructing students from grades 7 to 10. St. David received full funding from the Ontario Ministry of Education in 1985, when the school changed its educational focus to students in grades 9 to OAC. Since the OAC year of secondary school was phased out of Ontario schools in the 2002-2003 school year, St. David CSS now teaches grades 9 through to 12. At present (2011) St. David educates 1045 students. St. David is named after St David, a 6th-century saint.  Staff and administration  As of March 2016, St. David's principal is Glenda Leusink, with Michael Ambeau and Kevin Hinsperger as vice-principals. The school also has approximately 84 full-time teaching staff.  Uniform policy (2001 - 2002)  As with the other secondary schools in the Waterloo Catholic District School Board, St. David requires all students to wear a uniform every day, except for the occasional dress-down day (known to staff and students as \\"Civies Day\\"). During the 2001 - 2002 school year, this policy required all students to have golf and dress shirts tucked into their pants at all times, on the basis that untucked shirts did not convey the proper sense of respect for the school.http://www.wcdsb.edu.on.ca/ap_memos/PDF/APC005.pdf During the last two weeks of June 2002, the administration of St. David made a public announcement that any student in violation of the uniform rules would be suspended for one day. In Ontario, any disciplinary action of this type is listed on an Ontario student record, which may adversely affect a student's chances of acceptance to post-secondary education. Ontario student records also are investigated by teachers when reviewing students enrolled for classes, and by staff at other schools in the event a student applies for a transfer. No prior violations of the rules were taken into account with this policy. Suspension, as a punishment, is typically given for much more serious academic and criminal offences. However, the provincial Safe Schools Act allows discretionary one- day suspensions for minor infractions of school policies and procedures. These suspensions cannot be formally challenged, as the Safe Schools Act does not allow for appeals of one day suspensions.http://www.wcdsb.edu.on.ca/ap_memos/PDF/APC012.pdf Nevertheless, the consequence would add to a student's record, causing any subsequent offenses within five years to be judged more harshly.http://www.wcdsb.edu.on.ca/info/safe/disciplinary_actions.html The \\"tucked-in shirt\\" rule, though, was short-lived as at the beginning of the 2002 - 2003 school year, the policy was revised to eliminate the requirement of golf shirts being tucked in. right Notable alumni *Luca Congi, kicker/punter for the Saskatchewan Roughriders.

The term ‚Äòchromic‚Äô is defined as materials that can change colour reversibly with the presence of a factor. In this case, the factor is pH. The pH indicators have this property. Halochromic substances are suited for use in environments where pH changes occur frequently, or places where changes in pH are extreme. Halochromic substances detect alterations in the acidity of substances, like detection of corrosion in metals. Halochromic substances may be used as indicators to determine the pH of solutions of unknown pH. The colour obtained is compared with the colour obtained when the indicator is mixed with solutions of known pH. The pH of the unknown solution can then be estimated. Obvious disadvantages of this method include its dependency on the colour sensitivity of the human eye, and that unknown solutions that are already coloured cannot be used. The colour change of halochromic substances occur when the chemical binds to existing hydrogen and hydroxide ions in solution. Such bonds result in changes in the conjugated systems of the molecule, or the range of electron flow. This alters the wavelength of light absorbed, which in turn results in a visible change of colour. Halochromic substances do not display a full range of colour for a full range of pH because, after certain acidities, the conjugated system will not change. The various shades result from different concentrations of halochromic molecules with different conjugated systems.

She has 900 balcony staterooms and a deck of mini- suites. Caribbean Princess is slightly larger than the other ships in her class (, , and ), due to an additional deck of cabins called the \\"Riviera\\" deck. Another difference is that, being initially designed to cruise the Caribbean year-round, there is no sliding roof over the pool area for shelter in poor weather. Incidents On March 12, 2012, Caribbean Princess suffered a problem with her port side propulsion engine that required her to return to her home port of San Juan, Puerto Rico after a stopover in St. Maarten. The problem caused Princess Cruises to cancel the next two trips (scheduled for March 18 and 25). In November 2013 a scheduled Thanksgiving week cruise departure was delayed from the Houston, Texas cruise port due to inclement weather conditions. Above average winds combined with safety concerns related to the narrow and extremely busy Houston ship channel were cited from the ship's bridge as the main reasons for the delay. Further complications with pilot boat scheduling were also announced over the ship's public address system. Caribbean Princess finally departed on the next day, however two of the exotic ports of call (Belize and Roatan) were cancelled. An unscheduled stop at Costa Maya was added to the itinerary, but the advertised seven-night sailing with three stops ended up as six nights of actual sailing with only two stops. Caribbean Princess experienced a norovirus outbreak in January 2014 sickening approximately 200 people on board. The scheduled cruise ended two days early. On August 3, 2016, Caribbean Princess experienced a power outage while on a British Isles cruise. The ship completely lost propulsion about 25 miles southeast of Dublin, Ireland in the Irish Sea, and was left adrift for nine hours. During the power outage, air conditioners, lighting, hotel functions, and toilets were all functional. The ship regained power and sailed to Belfast, Northern Ireland, missing her next port of Dublin on her itinerary. An ocean-going tug was dispatched from Holyhead in North Wales, UK and an air/sea rescue helicopter from Dublin monitored the situation. The cruise continued without any further problems to either the ship or the passengers. Ocean pollution On August 26, 2013, the crew of Caribbean Princess deliberately discharged 4,227 gallons of oil-contaminated waste off the southern coast of England. The discharge involved the illegal modification of the vessel's on-board pollution control systems, and was photographed by a newly hired engineer. When the ship subsequently berthed at Southampton, the engineer resigned his position and reported the discharge to the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency. An investigation was launched by the United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division which found that the practice had been taking place on Caribbean Princess and four other Princess ships since 2005. In December 2016, Princess Cruise Lines agreed to plead guilty to seven felony charges and pay a $40 million penalty. The charges related to illegal discharges off the coasts of Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. As part of the agreement cruise ships from eight Carnival companies, including Carnival Cruise Line and Holland America Line, are required to operate for five years under a court- supervised environmental compliance plan with independent audits and a court- appointed monitor. According to the US Justice Department, the fine was the \\"largest-ever criminal penalty involving deliberate vessel pollution.\\" Areas of operation Caribbean Princess has undertaken cruises from European ports around the British Isles, northern Europe and the Mediterranean and from North American ports to the Caribbean, New England and Canada. The ship in July 2019 left her current home port of Fort Lauderdale, Florida and sailed up to a new home port in New York for cruises to Canada, New England, and Greenland. As of 2020, however, the ship sails primarily in the Caribbean.

The name means 'made by God.' Asahel was the nephew of King David, as well as the younger brother of both Joab, David's general, and of Abishai. Asahel is mentioned in 2 Samuel Chapters 2 and 3. Additionally, the name Asahel (under a variant spelling) appears in Aramaic in the Book of Enoch. Meaning The name is made up of two parts: the verb , Hebrew \\"to do, make\\" 3rd m.sg. perfect, and the theophorous element (deity name), , the Hebrew God El, or Elohim. This would make it a name of \\"thanksgiving\\", thanking God for what he has \\"made\\" or \\"done\\". History Asahel was the youngest son of Zeruiah, David's sister. His older brothers were Joab and Abishai. He was known for his swiftness of foot: \\"Asahel was swift of foot, like a gazelle in the open field, or like a wild deer.\\" (cf. ) and was told that if he was running through wheat field, the stalks wouldn't bend. He was put to death by Abner, whom he pursued from the battlefield when fighting against Abner at Gibeon, in the army of his brother Joab, (cf. ). He is considered among David's thirty valiant men (cf. ; 1 Chronicles ). After a battle at Gibeon between Abner, commanding the army of Ish-bosheth son of Saul and Joab, commanding the army of David, Asahel pursued Abner while he attempted to escape. Young Asahel soon caught up with Abner. Abner begged Asahel to stop pursuing him, but when Asahel refused to desist, Abner thrust the blunt end of a spear through Asahel's stomach, and Asahel died on the spot (cf. ). Although Joab won the battle, Abner escaped with his life; Asahel was buried in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. In retaliation, Joab murdered Abner with help from his brother Abishai, against the wishes of David.

Alternative names include hujra and baithak. These rooms were a typical feature of many Mughal era havelis palaces and mansions in the region. Many houses in the rural areas of Bangladesh, Pakistan and India still have mehmaan khanas for guests. In Bangladesh, it is more commonly known as baithak ghar or bangla ghar (). Hujra The term hujra is especially prevalent in the predominantly Pashtun areas of Pakistan. Pashtun hujras are used mainly to entertain male guests in a household, although sometimes community hujras are also maintained by tribal units. In individual houses, the size and trappings of a hujra are sometimes indicative of family status. As old as perhaps the Jirga itself is, Hujra is a community club situated in each village, each Khail (street) and some times owned by a well off family but shared by the whole community. Other than a place to accommodate collective ceremonies, male members of the community who hang out and associate like a larger family regularly attend hujra(s). Members of a Hujra are mostly close relatives but other people from neighborhood are also welcomed. Elderly people spend their day to enjoy hubble-bubble and chat over the tea, younger men in their spare time listen to the stories of elders and raise issues while the children keep playing around, waiting for a call from one of the elders to take a message or bring fresh tea. A guest house for male guests, Hujra also serves as a place to initiate Jirgas. Issues are put on the table, brainstormed and a consensus is developed before the issue can be put to the wider community. Hujra is considered to be a secular place but closely associated with Hujra is the role of mosque in the neighborhood. Although there are few similarities between a mosque and a Hujra, the role of mosque has gained more importance recently due to many national and regional settings tilted towards Islamization. Additionally, the role of Hujra is diminishing from community life because of the economic trends, and a faster pace of life which allows little leisure time with people to spare for community based activities. Decay in the institution of Hujra is definitely affecting the efficacy of Jirga, but this study tends not necessarily to argue for reinvigoration of Hujra; rather our focus will remain to find strengths and challenges for Jirga from where it is today and move forward. Etymology The term mehmƒÅn khƒÅnƒÅ is direct derivation from Persian and means \\"guest house or room.\\" In Iran and adjoining areas, the term can refer to hotels. The term (also spelled memonkhona in Latin script) is also used to describe a guest room in other parts of Central Asia. The term baithak (ÿ®€åŸπŸá⁄©, ‡§¨‡•à‡§†‡§ï or ‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶†‡¶ï) literally means sitting room in Hindustani and Bengali. Hujra is derived from Arabic and means room or cell. In non-Pashtun Muslim households or North India and Pakistan, the term hujra (ÿ≠ÿ¨ÿ±Ÿá, ‡§π‡•Å‡§ú‡§∞‡§æ or ‡¶π‡ßÅ‡¶ú‡¶∞‡¶æ) can also refer to a dedicated prayer room . In Bangladesh, hujra usually refers to the sitting room of Imam in a Mosque. Mehmaan Khana Mehmaankhana at Taj Mahal.

His biggest hit was the 1944 ballad, \\"I Wonder\\". Biography Gant was born in Columbia, Tennessee, but was raised in Cleveland, Ohio. He returned to Nashville, Tennessee and worked there as a musician, as well as touring with his own band, from the mid-1930s until he joined the army during World War II. In 1944, after performing at a War Bond rally in Los Angeles, California, he recorded his composition \\"I Wonder\\" for the tiny black-owned Bronze record label. When it started to become locally popular, he re-recorded it for the newly established white-owned independent Gilt-Edge record label.Nick Tosches, Unsung Heroes of Rock'n'Roll, Secker & Warburg, 1984, pp.69-71 His recording of \\"I Wonder\\" was released under the name \\"Pvt. Cecil Gant\\", as were later releases on the label. The Gilt-Edge release of \\"I Wonder\\" sold well. It reached number one on the Billboard Harlem Hit Parade (the former name of the R&B; chart), and number 20 on the national pop chart (as synthesized by Joel Whitburn); and its B-side, the instrumental \\"Cecil Boogie\\", reached number 5 on the R&B; chart. Gant wrote most of his own songs. Billed as \\"The GI Sing-sation\\", his two follow-up records on Gilt-Edge, \\"The Grass Is Getting Greener\\" and \\"I'm Tired\\", also made the R&B; chart. Arnold Shaw identified \\"I Wonder\\" as the song that \\"ignited the postwar blues explosion\\", and the success of Gant's records helped stimulate the establishment of other independent labels immediately after the war. He also released material through King Records (1947), and recorded for Bullet Records in Nashville until 1949. His 1948 recording of \\"Nashville Jumps\\" opens the 2004 compilation Night Train to Nashville. The co-founder of Bullet, Jim Bulleit, said of Gant: > He drank too much... He would say, \\"I want to do a session\\" when he ran out > of money. We would get a bass player and a guitarist and get him a piano, > and I'd go sit in the control room, and he'd tinkle around on it, and then > he'd say \\"I'm ready,\\" and tap that bottle; and if we didn't get it the first > time, we didn't get it, 'cause he couldn't remember what he did. He'd dream > up and write a song while he sat there, and he'd give me the title of it. > And the uniqueness of the thing is that all of them sold. In 1949 he returned to Los Angeles, and recorded for the Down Beat and Swing Time labels, before moving to New Orleans to record for Imperial Records in 1950, but with diminishing commercial success. Many of Gant's records had a slow ballad as the A-side but an up-tempo boogie woogie style piano-based song or instrumental as the B-side, in many cases foreshadowing rock and roll and influential on its practitioners. Examples include \\"We're Gonna Rock\\" (1950) and \\"Rock Little Baby\\" (1951). Cecil Gant, HoyHoy.com . Retrieved October 5, 2016 On some of his later records, Gant was credited, for unknown reasons, as Gunter Lee Carr. In latter years Gant was married and based in Nashville.

She went into self-imposed exile when James II fled England during the Glorious Revolution in 1688.Wilson, xxv Her novels, The Amours of Bosvil and Galesia, also published as Love Intrigues (1713), Exilius or The Banish'd Roman (1715), A Patchwork Screen for the Ladies (1723), and The Lining of the Patchwork Screen for the Ladies (1726) were written after she returned to London in 1704. Prior to and during her exile, she wrote a collection of poems justifying the value of feminine education and female single life, \\"Poetical Recreations\\" (1688),Mello, 2015 and a group of political poems, \\"A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times\\" (1701), which conveyed her anxiety about the political future of England. Although not known for her letter writing, four extant letters are located in the British Library and within the Magdalen Manuscript at the Oxford Magdalen library, written between 1670 and 1688.Pickard Jane Barker was one of the first female authors to publish writings both in manuscript and print form, allowing modern scholars to study \\"the passage of Barker's poetry from coterie circles to larger, more impersonal communities of readers\\"Jane Barker, Exile, 4-5 Never married, Jane Barker died quietly in 1732.Wilson, xxxi  Early life  Jane Barker was born in May 1652, in the village of Blatherwick, Northamptonshire, in England to Thomas Barker and Anne Connock.King, Kathryn R., 2004 Anne Connock seems to be descended from an unlanded and Roman Catholic branch of the Connock family, which might explain Jane's Papist affiliation.King, Kathryn R. A member of a royalist family, Jane Barker went into exile with James II once William of Orange entered England, threatening an overthrow of the outwardly Catholic James II.Jane Barker, Exile, 11 When Jane was 10 years old, Thomas Barker leased a property and manor in Wilsthorpe, Lincolnshire. This property was bequeathed to both Jane Barker and her mother upon her father's death in 1681 and she relocated to the property upon returning from exile in 1704.Jane Barker, Exile, 13 As a young woman, Jane Barker was taught Latin, anatomy, and herbal medicine by her brother, Edward, who matriculated at St. John's College, Oxford in 1668 and earned his M.A. from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1674‚Äì5.Wilson, xix Proof of Jane Barker's knowledge of medicine can be seen in the advertisement forDr. Barker's Famous Gout Plaister, and in her poems about anatomy found in her \\"Poetical Recreations\\".Wilson, xxiv Indebted to her brother for providing her with the basis of her education, Jane mourned his death in 1675, shortly after he finished his time at Oxford. Political affiliations and exile Barker was baptized on 17 May 1652 according to the rites of the Church of England; however, she converted to Catholicism during reign of James II (of England), between 1685 and 1688. After James' defeat by the Prince of Orange (William III) in the Glorious Revolution, London became a dangerous place for Catholics, prompting Barker to follow James II to exile in France. Following an ideology of Jacobitism, and a royalist, Jane Barker was one of the 40,000 people who followed James II in exile to France. She was one of the smaller number of individuals who maintained residence at Saint- Germain-en-Laye in 1689.Jane Barker, Exile, 119 James II maintained court in Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, a castle lent to the Stuarts by Louis XIV from 1689 to 1704. Barker's Jacobite involvement is further evidenced in her letter to James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, who began organizing a Jacobite invasion from France. Dated 19 March 1718, the letter implicitly informed Ormonde that his supporters in England awaited his invasion.Wilson, xxx However, the letter was intercepted in that same year by the British Secrete Office, the anti-Jacobite intelligence organization. Since Barker's name and handwriting were unknown to the government authorities, it is suspected that she was used as a ghost-writer for the letter‚Äîa technique used to protect plotters whose identities and handwriting were already well known by authorities.

Described as written by \\"several Gentlemen of the Universities, and Others,\\" the second part of Poetical Recreations was written by contributors from Cambridge or Oxford University.Jane Barker, Exile, 31 Originally printed without the author's permission by Benjamin Crayle, the title page of Poetical Recreations boasted that poems within were \\"Occasionally written by Mrs. Jane Barker\\". Benjamin Crayle also contributed twelve poems in Part Two and expressed his admiration for Barker's literary taste. A note in what is now called the Magdalen Manuscript suggests that the publisher did not have Barker's permission to print the collection: it reads \\"now corrected by her own hand.\\" The marginalia indicates that the initial collection was not yet meant for public consumption.Jane Barker, Exile, 31-32 Scholar Kathryn King finds evidence through marginal notations in the Magdalen Manuscript that Barker's works are autobiographical.Jane Baker, Exile, 33 =A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times= Written at the end of her time at Saint-Germaine-en-Laye, A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times is highly political and takes a pro-Stuart position.Jane Barker, Exile, 101 The speaker in the collection, Fidelia, is considered autobiographical. She is characterized as a Stuart loyalist and Catholic convert, depicting Barker's own political and religious affiliations.Jane Barker, Exile, 103 Upon returning to England, Jane Barker gifted a copy of her A Collection of Poems Referring to the Times to the son of James II for his birthday. The manuscript holding in the British Library is believed to contain a prototype copy of the collection.Jane Barker, Exiles, 122 Prose =Love Intrigues or The Amours of Bosvil and Galesia= The Entertaining Novels of Mrs. Jane Barker Originally printed in 1713 and revised and reprinted in 1719, Love Intrigues was the first installment in what came to be known as the Galesia Trilogy.Wilson, xxxvii It has been suggested that Bosvil's character was based heavily on a man whom Barker knew well.Wilson, xxxviii King suggests that the original edition of the novel in 1713 was not meant for publication because major revisions were made before it was reprinted, with a new title, in 1719.Jane Barker, Exile, 185 Love Intrigues was the first novel that Barker published, though probably without her permission, with Edmund Curll. Curll published some of her later works.Jane Barker, Exile 187 It was suspected that Curll probably added the term \\"Amours\\" to the title for better commercial appeal.Jane Barker, Exile, 186 =Exilius or The Banish'd Roman= Title Page from the 1715 edition of Jane Barker's Exiles. Published just after the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Exilius can be read as a pro-Stuart response to the succession crisis that followed Anne's death.Jane Barker, Exile, 150 There is some suggestion that Curll sped up the release of the work so that he could capitalize on the market potential during the political upheaval.Jane Barker, Exile, 152 This novel is understood to be a projection of Jacobite feeling through themes including romance, love, and heroism.Jane Barker, Exile, 153 Written primarily for a female audience, the male characters within the fiction are stock representations while female characters are developed virtuously and follow strict moral tenets.Grieder, 6 Jonathan Grieder states that formally the work is weak, but because it appeals to women during the early eighteenth century it can inform the reader about feminine interests during the time of its publication.Grieder, 9 = The Christian Pilgrimage = In 1718, Barker published her translation of a French Catholic devotional manual, The Christian Pilgrimage, originally written by Fran√ßois F√©nelon, the archbishop of Cambrai.Jane Barker, Exile, 154 Translated as a response to the severe government reprisals on the Catholic community in England in early 1716, this devotional manual reframed a Protestants' understanding of Catholicism in order to discourage any further egregious actions against the Catholic community.Jane Barker, Exile, 155 Barker's translation of F√©nelon's work offered a take on Catholicism that used the vocabulary of the Church of England; she removed extraneous Catholic representation from the original so as not to dissuade Protestant readership.Jane Barker, Exile, 157 =A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies or, Love and Virtue and The Lining of the Patch Work Screen= Published in 1723, A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies is based loosely on the Lettres Portugaises, published in 1669. The Lining of the Patch-Work Screen was written in 1726. Often recognized to be a blending of genre conventions including romance, bourgeois fiction, poems, hymns, odes, recipes, philosophical reflections, among others, the two works create a hybrid genre.Wilson, xxxix Barker uses the metaphor of the patch-work screen to raise questions about politics, sexual politics, economics, and finance in her society.Wilson, xl In A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies, Barker includes autobiographical information and also includes revised poems from Poetical RecreationsWilson, xli including \\"Anatomy,\\" the poem which indicates Barker's proficiency in medicine.  Gender issues  Capitalizing on the education she received from her brother, Barker established herself as an author within mostly male coteries during the second half of the seventeenth century.Jane Barker, Exile, 48 Barker worked to alleviate the stigma of spinsterhood and make it an acceptable alternative to marriage.Jane Barker, Exile, 63-4 A celibate woman, Barker belonged to the tradition of female martial valor and enjoyed her freedom from men in her own personal life.Jane Barker, Exile, 65 There is evidence that Barker used Katherine Philips' Orinda as a model for her own speaker, Fidelia,Jane Barker, Exiles, 45 without including homosexual undertones that are present within Katherine Philips' writings.Jane Barker, Exile, 55 Barker established herself as a published female author whose print works were primarily for a female audience.Jane Barker, Exile, 137 Her dedications, \\"to the ladies,\\" also suggest that she was writing for an elite female readership, although this dedication may have been included by Edmund Curll for marketing purposes.Jane Barker, Exile, 199 Legacy Jane Barker was the first woman to firmly position herself as an author working with both manuscript and print media.Jane Barker, exile: A Literary Career, 1675-1725, 4-5 Choosing to publish in both spheres gave both a mainstream readership as well as the more intimate coteries access to her work. Because of her interest in manuscript and print, Barker has one foot in the old world methods of circulating works and one in the modern market-place.Jane Barker, Exile, 207 Relying upon income from her later publications for money, Barker had more freedom and independence than other female authors of the early modern period.Jane Barker, Exile, 213 Depicted as an autobiographical author by Kathryn R. King, Jane Barker's works display a strong feminist bent, offering her readership information regarding single womanhood, female education and politics.

He was educated at Rongotai College, and then studied at Wellington and Dunedin Teachers' Colleges. In 1949, Colquhoun married Betty Ellen Petley. Career Colquhoun was a wicketkeeper and a useful lower-order right-handed batsman who came late to first-class cricket, not making his debut for Central Districts until he was 29. A year later, he was in the New Zealand Test team for the two matches against Len Hutton's 1954-55 England team, fresh from retaining the Ashes. England won both matches fairly comfortably and in the second, at Auckland, New Zealand were dismissed for 26, which remains the lowest-ever total by a Test match side. Colquhoun's own distinction in this second match was to be dismissed first ball in each innings by Bob Appleyard; each time, Alex Moir, who also failed to score in either innings, prevented the hat-trick. Colquhoun continued to keep wicket for Central Districts until 1963-64, when he retired. He also played for Manawatu in the Hawke Cup from 1952 to 1963. Colquhoun was a teacher at Palmerston North Boys' High School, and also a rugby triallist for the All Blacks.

In a brief racing career which lasted from 1905 until June 1906, he ran five times and won three races. After showing moderate form in 1905, he won The Derby on his seasonal debut at age three and then became the first British horse for twenty years to win France's most important race, the Grand Prix de Paris. He became a successful breeding stallion, siring major winners in Europe and the United States. His daughters produced the winners of eight classic races. Spearmint was placed on the winning sires and brood-mare sires lists on several occasions. Background Spearmint was a bay horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his left foreleg who stood 16 hands high. He was bred by Sir Tatton Sykes at the famous Sledmere Stud in Yorkshire. He was by the outstanding racehorse and sire Carbine, a New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame and Australian Racing Hall of Fame inductee to whom he was said to bear a striking resemblance. His dam was the unraced mare Maid of the Mint, by Minting. The mating of Spearmint's parents had actually been arranged by the Maid of the Mint's owner, Sir James Duke, but an expensive lawsuit then forced him to sell the now pregnant mare to Sir Tatton Sykes. Spearmint was doubly inbred to Stockwell in the 4th and 5th generations (4m x 4f x 5f).Morris, Simon; Tesio Power 2000 - Stallions of the World, Syntax Software Spearmint was sent to the Doncaster sales as a yearling and was purchased by Major Eustace Loder, who had been impressed by the colt when viewing him at Sledmere. The price of 300 guineas reflected the low opinion held by British breeders of Spearmint's sire. Spearmint was sent into training with Peter Purcell-Gilpin at Newmarket where, according to press reports, he was known as \\"Tom\\". Racing record =1905: two-year-old season= Spearmint showed modest form in three starts as a two-year-old in 1905. He made his debut in the ¬£835 Great Foal Plate at Lingfield on 15 July, where he started at odds of 9/4 in a field of ten runners and won by a head in a time of 59.2 seconds, despite meeting interference in running. He was then moved up in class for the Breeders' Foal Plate at Derby Racecourse in September and finished third to Black Arrow. On his final start of the year, he ran in the Richmond Nursery, a handicap race for two-year-olds at the Newmarket Houghton meeting in late October. Carrying top weight, he finished fourth. He was regarded as probably the third best juvenile in his stable after the colt Admirable Crichton (a half-brother to Pretty Polly) and the filly Flair. There was some speculation that Spearmint had only been entered in the Derby to act as a pacemaker for one of his more fancied stable companions. =1906: three-year-old season= Spearmint made good progress over the winter, and Gilpin planned to prepare the colt to challenge for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp in June, a race which had not been won by a British horse since the victory of Spearmint's maternal grandsire Minting in 1886. By spring, however, Admirable Crichton failed to make the expected progress between two and three, while Flair sustained a serious injury after winning the 1000 Guineas, leaving Spearmint as the stable's only viable Derby contender. He did not race in public before the Derby but beat Pretty Polly and the Cesarewitch winner Hammerkop in a private trial race. When the results of this \\"private\\" trial became public, Spearmint began to attract serious support in the betting markets, and his odds fell from 20/1 on 15 May to 11/2 a week later. At Epsom on 30 May, Spearmint started the 6/1 second favourite for the Derby behind Lally (on 4/1) and was ridden by the American jockey Danny Maher. He faced twenty-one opponents in what was considered an unusually strong field. The race run in fine weather attracted a crowd estimated at 500,000, including King Edward VII. Despite sweating freely in the hot conditions, Spearmint made a strong impression before the race as he demonstrated his \\"long-sweeping stride\\" on the way to the start. The early pace was exceptionally strong as the lead passed back and forth between Troutbeck and Picton, with Spearmint settled close behind. Two furlongs from the finish, Spearmint produced a strong run to take the lead and pulled ahead \\"in determined fashion\\" to win by one and a half lengths from Picton, with Troutbeck two lengths back in third. The winning time of 2:36.8 broke the race record set a year earlier by Cicero by 2.8 seconds. It was the third Derby win in four years for Maher, who had won on Cicero and on Rock Sand in 1903. Eleven days later, Spearmint was sent to Longchamp for the Grand Prix de Paris, run over a distance of 3000 metres. Ridden by the Irish jockey Bernard Dillon, he started 9/10 favourite in a field of thirteen which included the Prix du Jockey Club winner Maintenon. After a sprint for the lead to the first turn, Spearmint was settled in front by Dillon and held a clear advantage into the straight. The outsider Brisecoeur emerged as his only serious challenger, but Spearmint ran on strongly to win by half a length with Storm finishing third.Leicester, Sir Charles, ‚ÄúBloodstock Breeding‚Äù, J.A. Allen & Co, London, 1969 Dillon revealed that he had taken the colt to the lead from the start to forestall any attempts by the French jockeys to impede him. He described Spearmint as \\"the gamest horse I think I ever was on\\" and claimed that \\"the farther we had to go the farther he would have won\\". Spearmint received a warmer reception from the French crowd than was customary for a British winner, and was even kissed by several \\"fashionable French ladies\\". Major Loder was personally congratulated by French President Armand Falli√®res, who also paid a visit to the racecourse stables to view the winner. During his return from Longchamp, Spearmint had a \\"remarkable escape\\" when he emerged from a train accident near Amiens with only minor bruising to his head. Spearmint developed leg problems after his win in Paris, reportedly throwing a splint, and was withdrawn from his remaining engagements in 1906. Spearmint was kept in training in 1907, but his problems continued and by summer it was becoming clear that his legs would not stand up to further racing. He did not run again, and at the end of the year he was retired to stud. Stud record Spearmint stood as a stallion at Major Loder's Old Connell Stud in Ireland. He sired the winners of 295 races for ¬£166,855 in prizemoney, including classic winners in Great Britain, Ireland and the United States. His daughters produced the winners of eight classic races. Spearmint was placed on the winning sires and brood-mare sires lists on several occasions.Ahnert, Rainer L. (editor in chief), Thoroughbred Breeding of the World, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970Pryor, Peter, The Classic Connection, Cortney Publications, Luton, 1979 Among his offspring, he notably sired: * Catnip (b.m. 1910) - An Irish mare who went to stud in Italy where she became the second dam of the great Nearco * Chicle (b. 1913) - won Champagne Stakes, Brooklyn Derby, Leading sire in North America (1929), Leading broodmare sire in North America (1942) * Cyklon, won nine stakes races, sire of 12 stakeswinners, including Trivalve (won Melbourne Cup).ASB: Cyklon (IRE) Retrieved 2010-7-12 * Fausta won nine races, including the Italian Derby and Italian Oaks.

Every year, the House is opened on weekends in October. It is known for its satanic themes and intensity by New Orleans residents and tourists. The name \\"House of Shock\\" is a reference to the show of the popular long-time local horror host, Morgus the Magnificent. Following a 2014 shutdown, the House of Shock opened again in 2015. In 2017, the House was permanently closed after 25 years of service and was replaced with New Orleans Nightmare.  History  Founded by Pantera's frontman Phil Anselmo and friends, the House of Shock started in 1992 in Gracianette's backyard. In 1993 it moved to Gracianette's grandmother's backyard to allow for more room. During that year, local officials informed the group that if they wanted to continue they would need to move to a commercial location. The owners rented a warehouse on Baronne St. and brought in Steven Joseph to help manage the attraction. However, local officials attempted to shut down the attraction due to a room representing the Church of Satan, giving City Council cause to believe that the House of Shock was inappropriate for public viewing. The House of Shock operated in a different location close to the old location and was considered by many to be one of the best haunted houses in the United States.  The attraction  The horror show starts off with a pyrotechnic stage show complete with actors. After the show, guests walk through a zombie infested graveyard and funeral parlor, followed by the morgue and the butcher house. After being stained with blood, guests move on to the Church of Satan, which is largely the center of controversy regarding House of Shock. Once out of the church, guests are immediately pursued by actors armed with fake chainsaws. According to Karpelman, one woman died of a heart attack but was revived by Danneel Miller-Larkin and taken to the hospital by paramedics shortly thereafter.

Early life and start in the petroleum industry Feargus O'Conner Bowden Squire was born on February 12, 1850, in Bow, Devon, United Kingdom, to John and Mary Ann ( Ellicott) Squire. The family emigrated to the United States in 1860, and took up residence in Cleveland, Ohio. Squire had attended school in England, and continued his education in public school in the United States. When Squire was 15 years old, he left school to work in a local paper mill, but left soon afterward to work at the Alexander, Scofield & Company oil refinery. The petroleum refining industry was relatively new, having been founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1850 by Samuel Kier. The first production oil well was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859, and by the 1860s crude petroleum was being extensively refined into kerosene for lighting purposes (supplanting whale oil). Alexander, Scofield & Company formed in 1863, and was itself a new business. Continuing his education at night with private tutors, Squire worked his way up from refinery worker to kerosene dealer and then bookkeeper. Alexander, Scofield & Company was one of the four largest petroleum refineries in the Cleveland area, and in 1872 it merged with John D. Rockefeller Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler (the precursor to Standard Oil). On April 29, 1872, Squire and fellow bookkeeper John Teagle formed Squire & Teagle, a firm which bought and sold petroleum products. The following year, the two men allowed one of their former employers, William C. Scofield, to purchase an interest in the business. The agreement forming Squire & Teagle ran for only two years, and in 1875 Squire sold his portion of the business to Daniel Shurmer. Squire was still deeply interested in the retail delivery of refined petroleum, however. He used proceeds from the sale of his business to form Newman, Squire & Company. The firm developed a horse- drawn oil tanker and formed a subsidiary, the Cleveland Bulk Oil Co. It became the first company in American history to deliver refined petroleum door-to- door to retail customers. Rockefeller told Squire it wouldn't work, as the interior of the tank would rust and ruin the oil. But Squire shipped 10 tank cars, each containing 100 barrels of oil, from Petroleum Center, Pennsylvania, to Detroit, Michigan, and proved him wrong. Career with Standard Oil In 1876, Standard Oil bought out Newman, Squire & Co. Squire joined Standard Oil rather than remain on his own, working as an inspector for oil shipments leaving the country at Standard Oil's Weehawken, New Jersey docks. Squire moved to Baltimore, Maryland in 1877, where Standard Oil had purchased eight independent refineries. Squire organized these into the Baltimore United Oil Co. Squire served as an executive officer of Baltimore United Oil until 1879, when he retired for the first time from Standard Oil and returned to live in Cleveland. Squire rejoined Standard Oil in 1880. The company was making a major effort to dominate the lubricating oil business, and Squire became the company's agent in negotiating the purchase of two key distribution companies based in New York City: Libby, Bartlett & Kimball and Thompson & Bedford. The following year, Squire was made vice president of the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company, which manufactured and sold petroleum jelly under the brand name Vaseline and which had been acquired by Standard Oil in 1880. Squire was made secretary of Standard Oil in early 1885. In March, just after he had taken up his duties, oil refiner George Rice accused Squire, Standard Oil vice president Frank Rockefeller, and Oklahoma businessman Charles N. Haskell (later the first Governor of Oklahoma) of attempting to bribe a clerk in the firm of Scofield, Shurmer & Teagle (Squire's old petroleum company) in order to learn that company's financial secrets. The men denied the charge, which appeared to have been made irresponsibly, and the court ordered the accusation stricken from the record. Beginning in February 1887, Squire gradually took on more responsibilities at Standard Oil. John D. Rockefeller moved the company's operational headquarters to New York City, downgrading the Cleveland office to a mere refining and distribution center. Frank Rockefeller, angry at the corporate shift, was increasingly shunted aside by John in favor of Squire, who became much more involved in Standard Oil's decision making structure. One of Squire's roles was to help control subsidiary companies. Rockefeller appointed Squire director of the Buckeye Pipe Line Co. on May 24, 1887 (he served until May 26, 1896), and director of the Solar Refining Co. from its inception on December 6, 1886 (he served until June 13, 1892). By 1892, Squire also owned stock in Standard Oil, although due to the tight control exercised by the Rockefeller family he had only a single share. By 1897, Squire was a trustee of Standard Oil Trust Despite his upper- management role in the company, Squire never felt part of the Rockefeller inner circle. =Role in Ohio antitrust suits against Standard Oil= Standard Oil originally consisted of 39 companies (some local, others statewide, regional, or national in scope) closely owned by just 37 stockholders. At the time, many state laws prohibited corporations from owning stock in other businesses. How could Standard Oil control its various subsidiaries? The company hit on the idea of establishing a trust. In 1882, the 37 stockholders of Standard Oil signed a secret agreement to establish the Standard Oil Trust. They turned over their stock to the trust, and the trustees began running Standard Oil as a single company. In 1887, David K. Watson was elected Attorney General of the state of Ohio, and he immediately initiated an antitrust lawsuit against Standard Oil, under the authority of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The case was filed before the Supreme Court of Ohio in May 1890, On March 2, 1892, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that the Standard Oil Trust was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and ordered the trust dissolved. Despite the court's order, the Standard Oil Trust continued to operate as usual (although its trustees were now called \\"Liquidating Trustees\\"). In November 1897, the new Ohio Attorney General, Frank S. Monnette, sued the Standard Oil Trust for failing to adhere to the Ohio Supreme Court's order of 1892. The impetus for the action came from George Rice, an oil producer, refiner, and pipeline owner in Ohio. Rice owned six shares in the Trust, but nevertheless found his businesses constantly undercut by Standard Oil's predatory pricing and unfair business practices, and the denial of rebates given by railroads to the Standard Oil Trust's companies. When Rice attempted to convert his Trust shares into normal corporate stock, the Trust refused. Monnette convinced the Supreme Court of Ohio to establish a special commissioner, who had the power to subpoena witnesses and documents, take testimony, and issue a report on the status of the Trust's liquidation. Feargus Squire was considered one of the star witnesses for Standard Oil. He was first placed on the witness stand before the special commissioner in February 1899. The special commission ordered him to turn over all the financial documents, ledgers, and accounting books of the Standard Oil of Ohio (the largest company in the Standard Oil Trust). Squire refused on three grounds: (1) The demand was an unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution; (2) The books and ledgers could be used to indict the Trust under the laws of Ohio; and (3) Providing the books and ledgers would amount to self-incrimination, violating the Fifth Amendment's prohibition on self-incrimination. Squire was threatened with contempt of court, but Monnette backed down in favor of continuing with the proceedings. Squire became further involved in the lawsuit in a dispute about unfair business practices. George Rice had accused the Trust of attempting to drive him out of business by purchasing and then closing his refinery; when he refused to sell, Rice said, Standard Oil let it be known that Rice's refinery was worth only $25,000 (much less than Rice had claimed). In testimony before the special commissioner, Rice said that Feargus Squire had offered him $250,000 for his refinery, belying the later claim. Squire was not called to dispute the charge. Squire was then accused of attempted bribery. In December 1899, Monnette claimed that, in the original case against Standard Oil, Squire, Haskell, and Frank Rockefeller had offered Attorney General Watson a $500,000 bribe to cease all litigation against the trust. Monnette's claims were widely reported. But the Ohio Supreme Court declined to order an investigation of the charges because there was no evidence that any such bribe had been offered. The court dismissed the charge, and Monnette left office at the end of 1899 after declining to run for reelection. Monnette's successor, John M. Sheets, dismissed the state of Ohio's antitrust suits against the Standard Oil Trust. =Role in federal antitrust suit against Standard Oil= Squire's role in the suit against the Standard Oil Trust came to a close during the federal government's case against the trust, which led to the trust's breakup in 1911. In November 1906, the United States Department of Justice brought suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act against the Standard Oil Trust, accusing it of unfair monopolistic business practices. The suit also indicated all 65 companies overseen by the trust, and individuals personally such as John D. Rockefeller and his brother, William Rockefeller. The accusations included forcing railroads to deny rebates to other refiners, operating wholly owned subsidiaries as if they were independent companies, predatory pricing, bribery, intimidation, and industrial espionage. Federal prosecutor Frank B. Kellogg took a deposition from Squire in Cleveland in the summer of 1908. Squire was then called to the witness stand in Missouri in September 1908. Before court's special master, Squire testified that, to his knowledge, no bribes had ever been offered or paid by Standard Oil or its subsidiaries. He also angrily denounced any claims that Standard Oil had bribed state oil inspectors to spy on independent oil distribution companies. But in damaging testimony, Squire admitted that Standard Oil had purchased the independent New American Oil Company (Mansfield, Ohio) and Toledo Oil Company (Toledo, Ohio) and declined to disclose the fact for more than four years. These companies, and others which Standard Oil bought out, delivered refined oil in wooden barrels. Standard Oil delivered refined oil in metal tank cars, and wanted to drive the \\"barrel oil\\" companies out of business. Squire claimed that Standard Oil had \\"not advertised\\" the fact of its ownership in order to retain the goodwill these companies had. Once more, Squire was one of the star witnesses during the trial, and Kellogg subjected him to the most intense cross-examination for any witness thus far. The federal district court ruled on November 20, 1909, that the Standard Oil Trust was in clear violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the district court's ruling on May 15, 1911. Other business roles and investments Herman Frasch in 1918. Squire funded his sulfur mining efforts, a landmark in the history of sulfur production. =Association with Herman Frasch= As Squire's wealth grew, and he made business connections through his Standard Oil work, he began to develop a wide range of other business interests. Chemical engineer Herman Frasch was hard at work on a process to remove sulfur from sour crude oil. Solar Refining Co. was founded to utilize the process Frasch developed, which led to Squire's directorship with Solar. Frasch become Standard Oil's first director of research and development in 1888. Frasch next began work on a process to cheaply manufacture soda ash. The petroleum industry consumed large amounts of soda ash, which was used to decalcify drilling fluids. In 1892, Frasch established the Frasch Process Soda Company, with Squire as vice president. Salt was a major component of soda ash production, and in 1882 and 1883 Frash had secured patents on new methods to crystallize and grain salt from a brine solution. Frasch, Frank Rockefeller, and Squire formed the United Salt Company in 1892 as well, but a bad fire in 1894 and financial losses led to the sale of the firm to the National Salt Company in 1899. He became a director of National Salt in 1900. Frasch also patented a major new process for mining sulfur in 1890. The Frasch Process, which involves heating and melting the sulfur below-ground so it can be pumped to the surface, was a landmark in sulfur mining technology. Squire and Rockefeller invested heavily in the process, and in exchange received 30 percent of the profits generated by the patent's licensing. The Union Sulphur Company was incorporated in 1896. But Squire sold his share in the company to Frasch in 1899, missing out on Union Sulfur's explosive growth in 1903.; =Other investments and roles= For a time, Squire also dabbled in newspaper publishing. In 1890, he was one of the principal financial backers of the new Cleveland Daily World newspaper, and served as the paper's president. In 1895, the other two major investors, B.F. Bower and George H. Robertson, sold their interest in the Daily World to Robert P. Porter, former owner of the New York Press. Squire sold enough of his shares to Porter to give Porter control of the Daily World. Squire became director of a wide range of companies, including the Ohio Surety Co. in 1894, the Standard Telegraph & Telephone Co. (with Frank Rockefeller and Louis Severance), the Electrograph Company of America in 1901, and, in the 1910s, the Maynard H. Murch Co. (a Cleveland- based brokerage firm) and the McGraw Tire & Rubber Company. =Steel= Squire also became an investor in the Cleveland steel industry. In October 1899, Squire invested in the Metal Sales Company, maker of steel for the manufacture of streetcars. In 1901, he helped finance and incorporate the Semi-Steel Co. of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, which manufactured streetcar equipment, brakes, and small steel castings. His involvement in the burgeoning Cleveland steel industry led the Jenks Ship Building Company to name a steel bulk freighter, launched in 1903, the F.B. Squire in honor of Squire. The M. A. Hanna Company purchased the F.B. Squire in December 1915. In 1892, Squire was appointed secretary of the Cleveland Steel Castings Co. He maintained his interest in steel manufacture into the 1920s, becoming secretary and treasurer of the Carroll Foundry and Machine Co. of Bucyrus, Ohio, in 1922. Retirement On November 12, 1908, Feargus Squire announced that he was retiring from Standard Oil, effective January 1, 1909. He claimed exhaustion as his rationale. His son, Reginald, who was also employed by Standard Oil, resigned at the same time. (He joined the Lubric Company, manufacturer of lubricating oils and greases.) Feargus Squire and his wife, Louisa, spent 1909 and 1910 touring Europe, the Middle East, China, Japan, Micronesia, Polynesia, and Melanesia. In 1923, Squire served a single, one-year term as Mayor of Wickliffe. =Homes= \\"Squire's Castle\\", built about 1897 by Feargus B. Squire. Looking northeast at Cobblestone Garth in 1904. Squire's earliest known residence was at 1729 Euclid Avenue in Cleveland. This was his primary residence, and Euclid Avenue was known as \\"Millionaire's Row\\" due to the large number of mansions built there by wealthy men. In 1905, Squire moved to 7809 Euclid Avenue. This home was built in 1875 by Liberty E. Holden, a real estate investor and owner of The Plain Dealer newspaper. About 1890, Squire purchased of forest land near what is now Willoughby Hills, Ohio, east of Cleveland. He called it River Farm Estate, and planned to turn it into an English country estate complete with manor house. About 1895, Squire began construction on a gatekeeper's house in the Romanesque Revival style. The structure, which was exceedingly rustic (lacking running water, electricity, natural gas, or sewer) was completed about 1897. Squire abandoned plans for a manor house after encountering difficulty obtaining building materials and labor. Squire and his daughter used the gatekeeper's house as an occasional weekend country home (even spending most of the summer of 1903 there). But Squire's wife disliked the house, and Squire rarely visited it after 1908. He sold the estate and gatekeeper's house to developers in 1922. After the developers went bankrupt, the estate was seized by a local bank. The Cleveland Park Board (precursor to Cleveland Metroparks) purchased most of the land from the bank in 1925. The park board began calling the structure \\"Squire's Castle\\". Heavily vandalized over the years, the structure has been somewhat restored and is open to the public. About 1900 or 1901, Squire began construction on a second country home, Cobblestone Garth, in Wickliffe, Ohio. It was not unusual for wealthy men to own more than one country home at the time, but Cobblestone Garth was quite different from the unbuilt River Farm Estate: Built in the then-current Victorian architectural style, it was built primarily of wood, was much larger, and had most modern conveniences. Cobblestone Garth was largely complete by 1902, and featured in the book The Country Estates of Cleveland Men in 1903. After the Squires' return to the United States in late 1910, they moved permanently to Cobblestone Garth from Euclid Avenue. Although Cobblestone Garth itself was torn down at a later date, the rubble masonry border wall, gatehouse, and a distinctive lighthouse-like structure remained intact into the 21st century. It is located at 28787 Ridge Road in Wickliffe. =Personal life and death= Squire was a Baptist by religion, and a Freemason. On December 26, 1876, he married Louisa Christiana Braymaier of Cleveland. The couple had two children: Reginald Rockefeller (born 1882) and Irma Lissette (born 1884). Louisa died on October 29, 1927, at Cobblestone Garth of pneumonia. Feargus Squire fell ill with an undisclosed illness in 1931. He died at his home at 2533 Fairmount Boulevard in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, on July 21, 1932. He was buried in the mausoleum at Knollwood Cemetery in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. His wife, daughter, and son-in-law are all buried in the same room.

Life Caspar Castner was born in Munich, Bavaria, on October 7, 1655. He entered the Society of Jesus (\\"Jesuits\\") on September 17, 1681, and studied theology at Ingolstadt. He finished his studies there on 22 March 1694. For a short time, he taught logic at the gymnasium in Ratisbon. Afterwards, he devoted himself to the work of missions and sailed in 1696 for China at the head of a company of brother Jesuits from Portugal and Genoa. In China, where he was known as Pang Jiabin, he laboured with great success on Shangchuan Island and in the city of Foshan, then a competitor of Guangzhou. In 1702 he went with Father Fran√ßois No√´l to Lisbon and Rome in order, as representative of the bishops of Nanjing and Macao, to argue against the Bishop of Fujian's reopening of the Chinese Rites controversy. In 1706 he returned to China, bringing with him a number of missionaries. He died in Beijing, China, on November 9, 1709. Works Besides a number of elaborate reports on the question of Chinese Rites which he drew up with the aid of Father Noel, Father Castner also wrote an interesting but rare little work called \\"Relatio Sepultur√¶ Magno Orientis Apostolo S. Francisco Xaviero erect√¶ in Insula Sanciano MDCC.\\" It is an exact description of the island where from March 19 to June 2, 1700, he had been engaged in erecting, at the command of his superiors, a memorial over the grave of St. Francis Xavier. The book was accompanied by a good map. One of the few copies printed in China is in the so-called \\"Orban'sche Sammlung\\" of the library of the University of Munich. A translation was published by Father Joseph St√∂cklein in his \\"Welt-Bott\\" (Augsburg, 1729), No. 309. The title-page and map are reproduced in the work of Henri Cordier, \\"L'imprimerie sino- europ√©enne en chine\\" (Paris, 1901), 11-15. Legacy Besides his apostolic work, Father Castner worked in the sciences of navigation, astronomy, and cartography. He called the attention of the Portuguese Government to the fact that the voyage to Macau would be much shorter if the vessels followed a direct course from the Cape of Good Hope by the way of the Sunda Islands, avoiding Mozambique and Goa, and the result showed that he was right. He did excellent work in the mapping of the Chinese Empire, and had so great a reputation as a mathematician that he was made president of the mathematical tribunal and instructor of the heir to the throne.

History =As TV Patrol Cagayan de Oro (1995-2000)= The newscast was first broadcast on May 1, 1995 as TV Patrol Cagayan de Oro. It was the first program that replaced the Davao City-produced TV Patrol Mindanao (now TV Patrol Southern Mindanao) as its main regional newscast. It was initially anchored by Katherine \\"Kathy\\" Uba-Bermudez, together with Aljo Trinidad, Rommel Gantalao, Carlo Lomibao, Evangeline Lacambra, Priscilla Maniquiz, Mike Banos, Celine Hermenegildo and Jobelle Fernandez as its first set of regional reporters. It has since covered stories ranging from natural disasters, man-made disasters, religious conflicts, tribal conflicts, political controversies, social issues and crime stories in Region X, as well as Lanao del Sur in the Bangsamoro Region. The launch also made Bermudez the first ever female regional news presenter in Philippine TV history in a regular capacity. In 1997, Trinidad left the program to anchor another regional newscast, TV Patrol Northern Luzon (formerly TV Patrol Baguio) and later another regional newscast in 1999,TV Patrol North Central Luzon (formerly TV Patrol Dagupan, now TV Patrol North Luzon). While Lomibao and Hermenegildo were transferred to TV Patrol General Santos (later TV Patrol Socsksargen, now TV Patrol South Central Mindanao). Ana Lee Lugod, Katrina Louise Neri and Mylene Pabayo were hired as new reporters for the newscast and Edward Cayetano became co-anchor of Bermudez. In 1999, Railyn Joy Tabanao joined the anchor's chair together with Bermudez & Cayetano. =As TV Patrol Iligan (1999-2006)= On July 5, 1999, TV Patrol Iligan was launched. It was the first local news program in the Iligan City area with Priza Cinco, Rey Paraguya, Gil Luzon and Ronnie Enderes as its first set of anchors-reporters together with Vhanizza Cabantac, Eric Guerrero, Angelica Joy Gallentes and Raina Yu. Former Davao-based personality PJ dela Pe√±a was the last anchor of the newscast before it got cancelled in 2006. Despite the cancellation, ABS- CBN Channel 4 Iligan airs an hourly news bulletin with Enderes and Roxanne Arevalo.The Journalists of TV Patrol Iligan =As TV Patrol Northern Mindanao (2000-2018)= On May 1, 2000, TV Patrol Cagayan de Oro was renamed as TV Patrol Northern Mindanao. On February 2, 2004, Alden Bacal would become the main anchor for the newscast. He was later joined by Shiela Joy Labrador on January 15, 2007 as his co-anchor. Bacal would soon leave the newscast a month later to successfully run for a seat in Cagayan de Oro's city council. On April 30, 2007, PJ dela Pe√±a together with his fellow Iligan personalities joined in the Cagayan de Oro newscast to integrate the two editions into a unified TV Patrol Northern Mindanao, serving the entire Region 10. From 2010-2011, it used a dual-presenter format before briefly adopting, in 2012, the national edition's triple presenter format. Titlecard used from August 12, 2013 to July 12, 2017.Notably, TV Patrol Northern Mindanao is the first regional TV Patrol newscast to use the new TV Patrol visual and audio packages which were introduced on June 30, 2010 for the national newscast.

Final logo as TV Patrol Northern Mindanao from July 13, 2017 - June 29, 2018 On May 1, 2015, TV Patrol Northern Mindanao and ABS-CBN Cagayan de Oro celebrated its 20th anniversary and inserted \\"20\\" to its title card. On July 13, 2017, TV Patrol Northern Mindanao updated its logo, opening billboard and graphics while its lower thirds are changed to Arial font to match the national TV Patrol. This is the fifteenth regional TV Patrol to update its graphics, similar to the national newscast. =Relaunch as TV Patrol North Mindanao= As a cost- cutting measure to digitalize ABS-CBN Regional stations, aligning with Channel 2 Manila,ABS-CBN Regional cancels Agri Tayo Dito, MagTV na accessed June 30, 2018 the newscast further extended its coverage into the Caraga region, formerly served by TV Patrol Caraga, and rebranded as TV Patrol North Mindanao by July 2, 2018.

Before the change, it had already served the Cebuano speaking areas of Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur beginning 2012, when TV Patrol Northwestern Mindanao (then later branded Nuebe Patrol, which is independently produced by affiliate MIT-RTVN Pagadian) ended its telecasts and its news team had fused into the Cagayan de Oro bureau. The OBB was slightly updated to reflect the change (also adopted by TV Patrol North Luzon and TV Patrol South Central Mindanao, which were also launched on July 2, but among the new super regional news programs it is the only one that uses the current national graphics package throughout the telecast, with its lower thirds now using the Gotham font used in the national edition). It now serves hundreds of thousands of viewers in the Cebuano speaking areas of the Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao and Caraga regions both in analog and digital free to air and cable television. On May 1, 2020, TV Patrol North Mindanao celebrated its 25th anniversary during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The newscast temporarily suspended airings for the second time from May 5 until May 7, 2020, as a result of the cease and desist order of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to stop the broadcasting operations of ABS-CBN, but the newscast resumed on May 8, 2020 via Facebook's live streaming platform Facebook Live. The newscast aired its final episode on August 28, 2020 as a result of retrenchments after bills for the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise was denied by the Congress of the Philippines.

The PCP theorem says that for some universal constant K, for every n, any mathematical proof of length n can be rewritten as a different proof of length poly(n) that is formally verifiable with 99% accuracy by a randomized algorithm that inspects only K letters of that proof. The PCP theorem is the cornerstone of the theory of computational hardness of approximation, which investigates the inherent difficulty in designing efficient approximation algorithms for various optimization problems. It has been described by Ingo Wegener as \\"the most important result in complexity theory since Cook's theorem\\" and by Oded Goldreich as \\"a culmination of a sequence of impressive works [‚Ä¶] rich in innovative ideas\\". Formal statement The PCP theorem states that : NP = PCP[O(log n), O(1)]. PCP and hardness of approximation An alternative formulation of the PCP theorem states that the maximum fraction of satisfiable constraints of a constraint satisfaction problem is NP-hard to approximate within some constant factor. Formally, for some constants K and Œ± < 1, the following promise problem (Lyes, Lno) is an NP-hard decision problem: * Lyes = {Œ¶: all constraints in Œ¶ are simultaneously satisfiable} * Lno = {Œ¶: every assignment satisfies fewer than an Œ± fraction of Œ¶'s constraints}, where Œ¶ is a constraint satisfaction problem over Boolean alphabet with at most K variables per constraint. As a consequence of this theorem, it can be shown that the solutions to many natural optimization problems including maximum boolean formula satisfiability, maximum independent set in graphs, and the shortest vector problem for lattices cannot be approximated efficiently unless P = NP. These results are sometimes also called PCP theorems because they can be viewed as probabilistically checkable proofs for NP with some additional structure.  Proof  A proof of a weaker result, NP = PCP[n3, 1] is given in one of the lectures of Dexter Kozen. History The PCP theorem is the culmination of a long line of work on interactive proofs and probabilistically checkable proofs. The first theorem relating standard proofs and probabilistically checkable proofs is the statement that NEXP ‚äÜ PCP[poly(n), poly(n)], proved by . = Etymology of the name \\"PCP theorem\\" = The notation PCPc(n), s(n)[r(n), q(n)] is explained at Probabilistically checkable proof. The notation is that of a function that returns a certain complexity class. See the explanation mentioned above. The name of this theorem (the \\"PCP theorem\\") probably comes either from \\"PCP\\" meaning \\"probabilistically checkable proof\\", or from the notation mentioned above (or both). = History after the first theorem [in 1990] = Subsequently, the methods used in this work were extended by Babai, Lance Fortnow, Levin, and Szegedy in 1991 , Feige, Goldwasser, Lund, Safra, and Szegedy (1991), and Arora and Safra in 1992 to yield a proof of the PCP theorem by Arora, Lund, Motwani, Sudan, and Szegedy in 1998 . The 2001 G√∂del Prize was awarded to Sanjeev Arora, Uriel Feige, Shafi Goldwasser, Carsten Lund, L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz, Rajeev Motwani, Shmuel Safra, Madhu Sudan, and Mario Szegedy for work on the PCP theorem and its connection to hardness of approximation. In 2005 Irit Dinur discovered a significantly simpler proof of the PCP theorem, using expander graphs.See the 2005 preprint, . The authoritative version of the paper is . She received the 2019 G√∂del Prize for this. EATSC 2019 G√∂del Prize, retrieved 2019-09-11. = Quantum analog of the PCP theorem = In 2012, Thomas Vidick and Tsuyoshi Ito published a result that showed a \\"strong limitation on the ability of entangled provers to collude in a multiplayer game.\\" This could be a step toward proving the quantum analogue of the PCP theorem, since when the result was reported in the media, professor Dorit Aharonov called it \\"the quantum analogue of an earlier paper on multiprover interactive proofs\\" that \\"basically led to the PCP theorem\\". In 2018, Thomas Vidick and Anand Natarajan proved a games variant of quantum PCP theorem under randomized reduction. It states that QMA ‚äÜ MIP*[log(n),1,1/2], where MIP*[f(n),c,s] is a complexity class of multi-prover quantum interactive proofs systems with f(n)-bit classical communications, and the completeness is c and the soundness is s. They also showed that the Hamiltonian version of a quantum PCP conjecture, namely a local Hamiltonian problem with constant promise gap c ‚àí s is QMA- hard, implies the games quantum PCP theorem.

It was converted for the Sony PlayStation in 1998. A typical arcade football game in its nature, LiberoGrande introduced a novelty factor previously found in Namco's Top Striker for the Nintendo Entertainment System: the ability to play as just one player, instead of controlling the whole team, always swapping for players nearer the ball. This idea was later used by Konami in Winning Eleven/Pro Evolution Soccer titles in the Become a Legend mode, and by EA Sports in its various sports game franchises with the name Be a Pro. Gameplay The player starts to choose one of the star players, and then a national team. Each star player, based on a real football player but with changed names, except for initials (Zinedine Zidane is Zenon Zadkine, for instance) is rated in both ball skill, speed and shooting abilities. In addition to the original arcade mode, the home release adds an International mode (basically, the FIFA World Cup format), a league competition (up to eight star players/teams), which can be all human controlled and a skills mode where the player has to complete several training ground tasks such as hitting a target floating in the goal mouth or hitting an area from distance. The player roster in the arcade version consists of: (Hidden player) (Hidden player) (Hidden player) (Hidden player) (Hidden player) (Hidden player) (Hidden player) (Hidden player) (Hidden player) (Hidden player) There is a total of 48 national teams, but only 32 of them to choose from, depending on which version: North America *a *b * * South America  * *ab *a Africa * *b * *b *b Europe bc *bc *a  * *a *c  *c * *ac *bc *c *bc * *ac *c *bc Asia *a *a *b * *a *ab * a Only playable in the Arcade version b Only playable in the Japanese version c Only playable in the PAL version A sequel, LiberoGrande 2 (known as LiberoGrande International in Europe) was released for PlayStation in Europe and Japan only, but with less success than the first title.

Earlier periods are subject to definition debates. The Franks, for instance, comprised a union of Germanic tribes; nevertheless, some descendants of the Franks later identified themselves as Dutch, Flemish, French and again others as Germans. The capital of the medieval ruler Charlemagne's empire, the city of Aachen, lies in present-day Germany, yet he was a Frank. Though France takes its name from the Franks, the Dutch and Flemish people are the only ones to speak a language that descends directly from Frankish (the language of the Franks). Hence nearly all continental Western European historians can claim Charlemagne's victories as their heritage. The Holy Roman Empire he founded was largely - but far from entirely - German-speaking. The Kingdom of Prussia, which unified Germany in the 19th century, had significant territory in what is now Poland. In the early 19th century, the philosopher Schlegel referred to Germany as a Kulturnation - a nation of shared culture and political disunity, analogous to ancient Greece. Until the unification of 1871, Austria was considered a part of Germany - even though much of its empire never formed part of the Holy Roman Empire and was non-German in language and in ethnicity.  Ancient times  Roman lines and modern boundaries. During the ancient and early medieval periods the Germanic tribes had no written language. What we know about their early military history comes from accounts written in Latin and from archaeology. This leaves important gaps. Germanic wars against the Romans are fairly well documented from the Roman perspective, such as the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Germanic wars against the early Celts remain mysterious because neither side recorded the events. Germanic tribes are thought to have originated during the Nordic Bronze Age in northern Germany and southern Scandinavia. The tribes spread south, possibly motivated by the deteriorating climate of that area. They crossed the River Elbe, probably overrunning the territories of the Celtic Volcae in the Weser Basin. The Romans recorded one of these early migrations when the Cimbri and the Teutons tribes threatened the Republic itself around the late 2nd century BC. In the East, other tribes, such as Goths, Rugii and Vandals, settled along the shores of the Baltic Sea pushing southward and eventually settling as far away as Ukraine. The Angles and Saxons migrated to England. The Germanic peoples often had a fraught relationship with their neighbours, leading to a period of over two millennia of military conflict over various territorial, religious, ideological and economic concerns.  Middle Ages  The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (also referred as the First German Empire) emerged from the eastern part of the Carolingian Empire after its division in the Treaty of Verdun of 843, and lasted almost a millennium until its dissolution in 1806. It was never a unitary state; from the beginning it was made up of many ethnicities and languages and would at its height comprise territories ranging from eastern France to northern Italy. Its unifying characteristic was its Carolingian heritage and strong religious connotations, its claim to \\"German- ness\\" the ethnicity of most of its subjects and rulers.John M. Jeep, Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia (2001) covers AD 500 to 1500 The military history of Germany during the Middle Ages was full of siege warfare and the technological changes that come from fighting that kind of war. From the creation of the First German Empire in 843 until the creation of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg, the middles ages were fought in similar fashion to those of ancient times. Many changes were made due to the use of siege warfare and new military technologies. = Siege warfare = During the Middle Ages, siege warfare was the primary way in which war was fought and territory taken through conquest. There were field battles fought, in which they employed a phalanx formation similar to what would have been studied in Vegetius‚Äô De re militari. However, the vast majority of battles were fought in defense of or the attempt to take fortifications. The men required to partake in a siege came from different areas of society. There were some nobles, some knights, the kings personal men, as well as the vast majority being peasant farmers conscripted into fighting. Siege warfare in effect was the way in which war was fought in Germany during the Middle Ages; this led to advances in medieval military technology. = Military technology = With the use of sieges as the primary means of middle age warfare, there were changes in military technology that facilitated fighting this differing kind of warfare. That being said, advances in technology did not mean that old technology became immediately obsolete. One such advance was the trebuchet, but other smaller advancements were made as well. There were advancements such as new helmets called Spangenhemle as well as some Carolingian developments in weapon production. With the subsequent development in armor, there came advancements in handheld weaponry to deal with these developments. For example, swords became thinner and pointed on the tip in order to penetrate between gaps in plate armor. Crossbows as well became more commonly used in the defense of castles during siege warfare. In order to attack castles, the Springald was created to launch spears in succession, but was mainly used outside of Germany. Stirrups were developed which was integral in the use of shock combat during the Middle Ages. The creation of greaves was important in protecting the shins. = The reality of knighthood = In Germany, Baronets were known as (Ritter) or Knights. These were a title of nobility bestowed on people by the local lord. Following this, the title of Ritter was generally passed in a hereditary fashion until the end of the noble line. After which, the title and its holdings would revert to the lord to give out to someone else. Ritter's were considered the elite of the German military as their entire goal was to practice for war. They did this by competing in tournaments to keep themselves practiced. A Ritter would be considered of this lowest nobility but were considered the primary means of defense for many lords. All knights were nobility but not all nobles were knights. As well the nobility were not a military class, but quite contrarily avoided military conflict on the basis of their immense wealth. As well, knights would‚Äôve been more likely to ravage the countryside in order to get a country to submit to their authority, rather than seek open battle to prove their point. = Fortifications = Fortifications in Medieval Germany were built similarly to those of the Roman style, with the caveat of stone-built castles. Forts were generally well constructed and effective against attack. There were several kinds of fortifications such as the moat and bailey, earthworks, hill-forts, Urban forts, town walls, and fortified residences. Moat and bailey, the most common castles before the use of stonework's, proved ineffective against Viking invaders. In Germany, in 1200 there were only 12 towns with walls, and 9 of them were originally Roman walls. Later, crusaders built their own types of fortifications called crusader castles, meant to be used in defense of a strategic objective for Christendom. Mostly, the defense of territory gained in conquest against Muslims in the holy land. However, it's possible some could have been built in the Prussian Crusade in the 13th century. This all changed with the influence of gunpowder weapons as used during sieges. = Battle tactics = The tactics of the Middle Ages varied greatly. A large amount of tactics were still based on Roman ideas. Such as the use of training, regimentation, and the phalanx. Medieval commanders may have been educated or read in Vegetius‚Äô De Re Militari which would‚Äôve provided the bases for battle tactics. In historiography, Charles Oman believes that cavalry entirely dominated the battlefield of the Middle Ages, but others contend that the infantry continued to play the most vital role even through the early modern age. One example of tactics and strategy is the use of secrecy in Henry II in 1004 against Bohemians, which gave Henry the element of surprise so that he was successful in his campaign. Another strategy, employed primarily by knights, was to ravage the countryside and force people to submit when they run out of supplies. The vast majority of these tactics were learned from Roman times in surviving works. = Ninth century = In the year 800, Charlemagne is crowned Holy Roman Emperor including his dominions in Germany which he gained through military conquest of Saxon tribes. Through the ninth Century, after the death of Charlemagne in 814, the empire was split in the Treaty of Verdun in 843. This created the kingdoms of France, Germany, and Lombardy. Following the Treaty of Verdun, in 870 there was the Treaty of Meerssen. This treaty replaced the treaty of Verdun and split the empire again. The kingdom of East Francia (Germany) continued to exist under the conditions of this treaty. However, within 10 years this led to further conflict between German and French Kings. = Tenth century = In July 907, an army of Germans faced off against Hungarians in the Battle of Pressburg. The result was a decisive Hungarian victory in which the Hungarians were able to pillage what is today modern eastern Germany. The following year in 908, the Hungarians scored another victory at the battle of Eisenach and continued to ravage the German countryside and demand tribute from local lords. This trend continued with the first battle of Lechfeld in 910 when the imperial army lost to the Hungarian invaders during the use of a feigned retreat tactic. From 919‚Äì36, the Germanic peoples (Franks, Saxons, Swaben and Bavarians) were united under Henry the Fowler, then Duke of Saxony, who took the title of King. For the first time, the term Kingdom of the Germans (\\"Regnum Teutonicorum\\") was applied to the Frankish kingdom. The Treaty of Bonn was signed in 921 between Charles III of France and Henry I of Germany. They established the Rhine river as the border and neutral territory of their kingdoms. The treaty was ultimately a failure and led to tensions and military conflict between the kingdoms. In 933, Henry the Fowler met with an assembly in which they expressed their desire to renew their war with the Magyars (Hungarians). The Magyars attempted to catch the Saxons by surprise, but ultimately failed when they split their army in two. This resulted in Henry destroying both army sections with his superior weapons and training. The name of this conflict was known as the Battle of Riade. Henry I and his son Otto I inherited their administrative qualities from their Carolingian ancestors and thus were able to field armies much larger than medieval military historiography believed was capable at that time. The efficiency of military organization in tenth-century Germany was much higher than believable. This can be seen in the number of sieges, which would require extensive logistics, that were conducted during the century. Otto I and his subsequent descendants were tasked with defending the military borders to the east of modern-day Germany. Their enemies were primarily Slavic and roaming Steppe peoples. In 953-954 Otto the Great was forced to fight his sons Conrad the Red and Luidolf in a civil war in modern-day Germany. The war was fought over old Roman fortifications such as Mainz and Regensburg. In the subsequent year, during which the Ottonian kingdom would've been weaker, the Magyars invaded with the objective of besieging cities in search of booty. The number of forts and their organization also pointed to extensive work done by the first kings of Germany during the 10th century during the Middle Ages. In 955, the Magyars were decisively defeated at the second battle of Lechfeld by Otto the Great, ending the threat from the Eurasian steppes for four centuries. In 962, partly on the strength of this victory, Otto invaded Italy on his way to Rome and was crowned the first Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by the pope. The War of the Three Henries was fought between 977‚Äì978. The war was a short lived rebellion by three German princes, all of which were named Henry, against Emperor Otto II. The three Henries were, Bishop Henry I of Augsburg, Henry the Wrangler, and duke Henry I the Younger. Otto was fighting the rebellion of the three Henries when King Lothair III of France invaded Germany and attacked the imperial capital of Aachen with 20,000 men. Otto was forced to flee to Dortmund where he created an effective response. He then counter-invaded France and laid siege to Paris but was forced to withdraw during the winter months. He then turned to defeating the rebellious princes, which he did by besieging Passau where the rebels had gathered. Otto took Passau and punished the three princes for their insurrection. = Eleventh century = Between 1002-1024, Henry II of Germany was able to conscript forces across his entire kingdom for a campaign south of the alps into Italy. As was common in previous centuries, all able-bodied men in the Holy Roman Empire were required to defend their home if it was under threat. Germany during the eleventh century was engulfed in civil war most notably in the 1070s and 1080s. It began during the reign of Henry IV in 1056. During the civil War, Henry IV found time to siege Rome twice in 1081 and 1084. The struggle of the civil war broke German military and political power so that later the kingdom and empire would dissolve into hundreds of autonomous states for some time. = Twelfth century = By 1155, the German states had descended into disorder. Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa managed to restore peace through diplomacy and skillfully arranged marriages. He claimed direct imperial control over Italy and made several incursions into northern Italy, but was ultimately defeated by the Lombard League at Legano in 1176. Despite his defeat, he did manage to receive the imperial coronation from the pope, thus aiding Barbarossa in his efforts to restore the empire to its former glory that it experienced under Otto I. In 1189, Frederick embarked on the Third Crusade. After a few initial successes against the Turks, notably at the Battle of Iconium, Frederick died when trying to cross a river. Leaderless, panicked and attacked on all sides, only a tiny fraction of the original forces continued onward. Towards the end of the twelfth century in 1198, there was the beginning of the German Throne Dispute. Henry VI died unexpectedly and there was a succession crisis. The direction of the empire was under scrutiny and was altered by the princes of the empire. The result was a conflict that lasted almost 17 years before the son of Henry VI, Frederick II, was able to regain his title and power as Holy Roman Emperor. = Thirteenth century = Teutonic Knights In 1226 Konrad I of Masovia appealed to the Teutonic Knights, a German crusading military order, to defend his borders and subdue the pagan Baltic Prussians.Henryk Sienkiewicz and Miroslaw Lipinski, eds. The Teutonic Knights (1996) The conquest and Christianization of Prussia was accomplished after more than 50 years, after which the Order ruled it as a sovereign Teutonic Order state. Their conflict of interests with the Polish-Lithuanian state lead in 1410 to Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) where a Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted a decisive defeat and broke its military power, although the Order withstood the following Siege of Marienburg and managed to retain most of its territories.David Nicolle and Graham Turner, Teutonic Knight: 1190-1561 (Warrior) (2007) In 1212, Emperor Frederick was forced to fight a civil war to defend his title. He defended his title and owed the Pope for acknowledging him and helping him retain his title. For this, Emperor Frederick passed the Golden Bull of Eger in which he made concessions to the church. In 1244, the war of Flemish Succession broke out with two counties, one German and one French, arguing over who was to succeed Margaret II, Countess of Flanders. The conflict was between half-brothers, both of whose mother was the aforementioned Margaret, John I of Avesnes and Guy of Dampierre. The result of the war was John I of Avesnes defeating his mother and half brother with the aid of Count William of Holland. The Teltow-Magdeburg Wars were fought in the modern German state of Brandenburg. It was fought between 1239‚Äì1245 over the ownership of some eastern German territories. The war was between princes of the Holy Roman Empire. The result was that Otto the Pious and John I of Brandenburg (Brothers who jointly ruled Brandenburg) expanded their holdings in eastern Germany. Following their conquest, the brothers would later go on to help the Teutonic Order defeat a Prussian uprising in the middle of the 1260s. In 1260, there was a small uprising in the town of Hamelin. The townsfolk rose up in response to a threat by the Bishop of Minden. The Battle took place at the abandoned village of Sedemuender. The result was the total defeat of the townsfolk. = Fourteenth century = In 1311, Reichskrieg, (Imperial War) a war between the Holy Roman Empire and the Count of W√ºrttemberg broke out. The Count, Eberhard, was upset that the imperial Ban was placed on him for the way he handles a court case and crisis around his duties as Landvogt (Military Protector). In 1361, a war between the Hanseatic League and the Danes broke out. The Hanseatic League won when they conquered Copenhagen. The war lasted nine years and resulted in the Treaty of Stralsund. In 1393, the ‚ÄûVitalienbr√ºder,‚Äú or the ‚ÄúVictual Brothers‚Äù harassed the Hansa and other ships on the Baltic and north seas. The pirates were brutal and by 1393 the only way for cargo ships to travel was in convoys. The Hansa built some defensive ships but nothing that could completely wipe of the brothers like they had hoped. It was the master of the Teutonic Knights, Konrad von Jungingen that besieged and conquered the Vitalienbr√ºder base at Gotland that finally ended their reign of terror as the remainder of the pirates were forced to move into other seas. = Fifteenth century = In 1410, the Teutonic Order or (Deutscher Ordensstaat) in German, situated in modern-day Poland, was dealt a defeat by the Polish-Lithuanian forces by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. This marked an ending to the power of the German religious state in eastern Europe. = Hussite wars = The Hussite Wars, fought between 1419 and 1434 in Bohemia, had their origins in a conflict between Catholics and the followers of a religious sect founded by Jan Hus. The inciting action of the war was the First Defenestration of Prague, in which the mayor and the town council members of Prague were thrown from the windows of the town building. Emperor Sigismund, a firm adherent of the Roman Catholic Church, obtained the support of Pope Martin V who issued a papal bull in 1420 proclaiming a crusade. In all, four crusades were launched against the heretics, all resulting in defeat for the Catholic troops. The Hussites, capably led by Jan ≈Ωi≈æka, employed novel tactics to defeat their numerically superior enemies, decisively at Aussig. Whenever a crusade would end, the Hussite armies go on \\"Beautiful Rides\\" and would invade the lands where the crusaders were from. One such place was Saxony. After ≈Ωi≈æka's death in 1424, the Hussite armies were led by Prokop the Great to another victory at the Battle of Tachov in 1427. The Hussites repeatedly invaded central German lands, though they made no attempt at permanent occupation, and at one point made it all of the way to the Baltic Sea. The Hussite movement was ended in 1434, however, at the Battle of Lipany.Stephen Turnbull and Angus McBride, The Hussite Wars 1419-36 (Men- at-Arms, 2004) Historiography tends to believe that the Middle Ages end in 1453 with the emergence of the printing press in Mainz; thus, beginning the early modern age of Germany, and more broadly the early modern European age.\\"Death of Frederick of Germany\\" by Gustav Dore Reformation During the German Peasants' War, spanning from 1524 to 1525 in the Holy Roman Empire, the peasants rebelled against the nobility. The rebellion ultimately failed in the end and Emperor Charles V became much harsher.Douglas Miller and Angus McBride, Armies of the German Peasants' War 1524‚Äì26 (Men-at-Arms series) (2003) Thirty Years War From 1618 to 1648 the Thirty Years' War ravaged Germany, when it became the main theatre of war in the conflict between France and the Habsburgs for predominance in Europe. Besides being at war with Catholic France, Germany was attacked by the Lutheran King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who won many victories until he was killed at L√ºtzen. The war resulted in large areas of Germany being laid waste, causing general impoverishment and a loss of around a third of its population; it took generations to recover. It ended with the Peace of Westphalia, which stabilized the nation states of Europe.Peter H. Wilson, The Thirty Years War: Europe's Tragedy (2009) Sack of Magdeburg in 1631. Of the 30,000 citizens, only 5,000 survived. The imperial general Prince Eugene of Savoy faced the Ottoman Turks on the battlefield, first coming to prominence during the last major Turkish offensive against the Austrian capital of Vienna in 1683. By the closing years of the 17th century, he was already famous for securing Hungary from the Turks, and soon rose to the role of principal Austrian commander during the War of the Spanish Succession. 18th century From 1701‚Äì1714 the War of the Spanish Succession, Germany fought with the English and the Dutch against the French. During the early part of the war, the French were successful until Camille de Tallard was victorious in the Palatinate. Later, in 1706, the Germans took back their land with the help of the Dutch and the English. The Austrians pushed the French back in North Italy and the coalition scored several successes in the low countries. At that time, half of the Dutch or the British armies were composed of German mercenaries. The German states that participated in the war were Austria (which contributed the most), Prussia and Hanover. During the reign of Frederick William I (1713‚Äì40), the military power of Prussia was significantly improved. He organized the government around the needs of his army, and produced an efficient, highly disciplined instrument of war. The Prussian Army was expanded to 80,000 men, about 4% of the total population. Peasants were drafted into the military and trained for duty, but were sent home for ten months out of each year. =Frederick the Great= Frederick the Great, king of Prussia from 1740‚Äì86, modernized the Prussian army, introduced new tactical and strategical concepts, fought mostly successful wars and doubled the size of Prussia. Frederick had a rationale based on Enlightenment thought: he launched total wars for limited objectives. The goal was to convince rival kings that it was better to negotiate and make peace than to fight him.Dennis E. Showalter, The Wars of Frederick the Great (1996) In the War of Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì48) Empress Maria Theresa of Austria fought successfully for recognition of her succession to the throne. However, during the subsequent Silesian Wars and the Seven Years' War, King Frederick the Great (Frederick II) occupied Silesia and forced Austria to formally cede control in the Treaty of Hubertusburg of 1763. Prussia had survived the combined force of its neighbours, each larger than itself, and gained enormously in influence at the cost of the Holy Roman Empire. It became recognised as a great European power, starting a rivalry with Austria for the leadership of the German-speaking lands.Robert Asprey, Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma (2007) pp 425‚Äì560 During the Seven Years' War, Prussia fought on the side of Britain against Russia, Sweden, Austria, France, and Saxony. Frederick II of Prussia first invaded Saxony and defeated a Saxon army at Lobositz. Frederick would then invade Bohemia, the Prussians besieged Prague, but they were defeated at Kolin. Since Prussia looked vulnerable, the Austrians and French invaded Prussian lands. However, the French were defeated at Rossbach and the Austrians at Leuthen. In 1758, Frederick the Great tried to invade Austria, but he failed. Now, the Russians tried to defeat the Prussians, but the Prussians earned a pyrrhic victory at the Zorndorf. The Swedes, however, fought the Prussians to a draw at Tornow. However, Austria gained a victory against the Prussian main army at Hochkirch. In 1759, the Prussians lost at Kunersdorf to the combined Russians and Austrians. Berlin itself was taken for a few days in 1762, but its army could not be destroyed. However, the great alliance against Prussia broke up when Elizabeth of Russia died. It was from her death that a pro-Prussian ruler, Peter III would sue for peace. It was thanks to this \\"miracle of the House of Brandenburg\\" and to the unshakable will of Frederick that Prussia survived.Franz A.J. Szabo, The Seven Years War in Europe: 1756‚Äì1763 (2007) Napoleonic Wars (1805‚Äì15) The Napoleonic era ended the Holy Roman Empire and created new German-speaking states that would eventually form modern Germany. Napoleon I of France reorganized many of the smaller German-speaking states into the Confederation of the Rhine following the battle of Austerlitz in 1805.Robert P. Goetz, 1805: Austerlitz: Napoleon And The Destruction Of The Third Coalition (2005) Essentially this enlarged the more powerful states of the region by absorbing the smaller ones, creating a set of buffer states for France and a source of army conscripts. Neither of the two largest German- speaking states were part of this confederation: the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire remained outside it.David Gates, The Napoleonic Wars 1803‚Äì1815 (1997) Napoleon at the battle of Austerlitz, by Fran√ßois Pascal Simon, Baron G√©rard King Frederick William III of Prussia viewed the Confederation of the Rhine as a threat to Prussian interests and allied against Napoleon. At this time the reputation of the Prussian army remained high from the period of the Seven Years' War. Unfortunately they retained the tactics of that period and still relied heavily on foreign mercenaries. The lack of military reforms would prove disastrous. Prussian defeats at Jena and Auerstedt led to a humiliating settlement that reduced the size of the country by half. the original Iron Cross military medal from 1813 The Electorate of Hanover, up till the Convention of Artlenburg ruled in personal union by the English King George III, was incorporated into Prussia. The King's German Legion formed in Britain from officers and soldiers of the dissolved Hanoverian army, was the only army of a German state that was continually fighting the Napoleonic army. A demoralised Prussia brought its distinguished old general Gebhard von Bl√ºcher out of retirement and reorganized the army. The reforms of the Prussian military were led by Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and converted the professional army into one based on national service. They brought in younger leaders, increased the rate of mobilisation and improved their skirmishing and unit tactics. They also organized a centralized general staff and a professional officer corps.Charles Edward White, The Enlightened Soldier: Scharnhorst and the Militarische Gesellschaft in Berlin, 1801‚Äì1805 (1988) Following Napoleon's defeat in Russia, Prussia, Austria and a few other German states saw their chance and joined the anti-French forces in the Sixth Coalition, which won a decisive victory over France at Leipzig in 1813 and forced the abdication of Napoleon. Although declared an outlaw by the Congress of Vienna, Napoleon returned and met a final defeat at the hands of Bl√ºcher and Wellington at Waterloo in 1815.Roger Parkinson, The Hussar General: The Life of Blucher, Man of Waterloo (2000) Uniting Germany (1815‚Äì71) By 1815 there were 39 separate German-speaking states, loosely joined (for free trade purposes) in the German Confederation, under the leadership of Prussia and Austria. Under the leadership of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, Prussia united the German states and defeated both Austria and France, 1866 to 1871, allowing the formation of a powerful German Empire, which lasted until 1918. Bismarck after 1871 dominated European diplomacy, and set up a complex system of balances that kept the peace. He was replaced in 1890 by the young Kaiser Wilhelm II, who built up a powerful Navy to challenge the British, and engaged in reckless diplomacy. =Clausewitz= Carl von Clausewitz (1780‚Äì1831) was the most important German military theorist; he stressed the moral and political aspects of war. Clausewitz espoused a romantic or Hegelian conception of warfare, stressing the dialectic of how opposite factors interact, and noting how unexpected new developments unfolding under the \\"fog of war\\" called for rapid decisions by alert commanders. Clausewitz saw history as a complex check on abstractions that did not accord with experience. In opposition to his great rival Antoine-Henri Jomini he argued war could not be quantified or graphed or reduced to mapwork and graphs. Clausewitz had many aphorisms, of which the most famous is, \\"War is not merely a political act, but also a political instrument, a continuation of political relations, a carrying out of the same by other means,\\" a working definition of war which has won wide acceptance.Jon Tetsuro Sumida, \\"The Relationship of History and Theory in On War: The Clausewitzian Ideal and Its Implications,\\" Journal of Military History Vol. 65, No. 2 (Apr., 2001), pp. 333‚Äì354 in JSTOROtto von Bismarck became Chancellor of a united Germany after defeating France in 1871 German Empire 1871-1919 After Prussia under Otto von Bismarck won a series of wars against Denmark, Austria and France, it united most of the German states into the German Empire. Its highly professional army set world standards but fought no more wars until 1914.Alfred Vagts, \\"Land and Sea Power in the Second German Reich.\\" Journal of Military History 3.4 (1939): 210+ online =Wars of Unification= After a period of constitutional deadlock between crown and parliament in Prussia, a crisis arose in 1863 over the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, disputed between Denmark and the German Confederation. After the Danish annexation of Schleswig, Otto von Bismarck, the new prime Minister of Prussia, made the smaller states of the German Confederation join Prussia and Austria in the war with Denmark. The Second Schleswig War ended with the defeat of the Danes at Dybb√∏l, and an agreement between Austria and Prussia to jointly administer Schleswig and Holstein. Bismarck then set about making Prussia the undisputed master of northern Germany, weakening Austria and the German Confederation. This eventually led to a German civil war, the Austro-Prussian War, in which in the Battle of Langensalza (the last battle between Germanic states on German soil) Hanover won a victory, but was so weakened by it, that it could offer no resistance to the occupation by Prussia and ceased to be an independent state. The victory of Prussia and its allies at K√∂niggr√§tz in July 1866, against Austria and its allies sealed this. The result was the dissolution of the German Confederation, and the creation of the North German Confederation one year later.Dennis E. Showalter, The wars of German unification (2004) The Prussian 7th Cuirassiers charge the French guns at the Battle of Mars-La-Tour, August 16, 1870 Bismarck wanted a war with France to unify the German peoples, and French Emperor Napoleon III, unaware of his military weakness, provided the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, expecting support from Prussia's recent enemies. Unlike in the war only a few years ago, the Germans turned not against each other, with the first emergence of a strong German national sentiment in the background. Instead, the southern German monarchs of Bavaria, W√ºrttemberg, and Baden honoured their secretly negotiated treaties of mutual defence with Berlin, while Austria remained neutral. The Germans, led by King William I of Prussia and Moltke the Elder, mobilized a mass conscript army of 1.2 million men (300,000 regulars and 900,000 reserves and Landwehr) which faced 492,585 experienced regular French soldiers and 420,000 Garde Mobile under Napoleon III of France. Within the first month of war the German army encircled big French armies, at Gravelotte, Metz, and Sedan and destroyed them. The war culminated with the defeat of the French army during the Siege of Paris, and was followed by the proclamation of the German Empire in 1871.Michael Howard, The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870‚Äì1871 (1961) excerpt and text search =Naval race= The results of these wars was the emergence of a powerful German nation-state and a major shift in the balance of power on the European continent. The Imperial German Army now was the most powerful military in Europe. Although Germany now had a parliament, it did not control the military, which was under the direct command of the Kaiser (Emperor). The German economy was rapidly growing, as was German pride and intense nationalism. After 1890, Germany made a major effort to build up its navy, leading to a naval arms race with Britain. Germany also sought coaling stations because the coal-burning warships had to be refueled frequently, and Britain had a large worldwide network. Efforts to gain coaling stations in the Caribbean or west Indies failed. By 1900, the possibility of a conflict between Germany and Britain loomed larger, as Germany built up its own (much smaller) colonial empire, and started a naval race to try and catch up with Britain, the world's dominant naval power.Robert K Massie, Dreadnought: Britain, Germany and the coming of the Great War, (1991) is popularPaul M. Kennedy, The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism: 1860‚Äì1914 (1980) is advanced  First World War (1914‚Äì18)  German soldiers on the front in the First World War The German Schlieffen plan to deal with the Franco-Russian alliance involved delivering a knock-out blow to the French and then turning to deal with the more slowly mobilised Russian army. At the start of the First World War, Germany attacked France through Belgium to avoid French defenses on the French-German border. They were beaten back at the First Battle of the Marne. Three years of stalemated trench warfare on the Western Front produced millions of casualties (with one-third killed). New tactics in 1918 opened up the war, but a series of massive German offensives failed in spring 1918, and Germany went on the defensive as fresh American soldiers arrived at the rate of 10,000 a day. Militarily defeated, stripped of allies, and exhausted on the homefront, Germany signed an armistice in November 1918 that amounted to a surrender.Holger H. Herwig, The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary 1914‚Äì1918 (2009) German artillery shown on a 1914 postcard In the East, however, the war was not confined to trenches. The Russian initial plans for war had called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian Galicia and German East Prussia. Although Russia's initial advance into Galicia was largely successful, it was driven back from East Prussia by the victories of the German generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes in August and September 1914. Russia's less-developed economic and military organisation soon proved unequal to the combined might of the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires. In the spring of 1915 the Russians were driven back in Galicia, and in May the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on Poland's southern fringes, capturing Warsaw on 5 August and forcing the Russians to withdraw from all of Poland, known as the \\"Great Retreat\\". The German Fleet spent most of the war bottled up in port; the great Battle of Jutland in 1916 showed superior German tactics could not overwhelm the more powerful British fleet. Submarines ‚Äì the U-boats- were used by the Imperial German Navy to sink merchant ships bringing supplies to England. This strategy alienated the United States, which declared war in April 1917. Shipments of food and munitions to Britain and France were increased, as the convoy system largely neutralized the U-boats.Paul Halpern, A Naval History of World War I (1994) ch 10‚Äì13 excerpt and text search By 1917 the German army had begun employing new infiltration tactics in an effort to break the trench warfare deadlock.Bruce I. Gudmundsson, Stormtroop Tactics: Innovation in the German Army, 1914‚Äì1918 (1995) Units of stormtroopers, were trained and equipped for the new tactics, and were used with devastating effect along the Russian front at Riga then at the Battle of Caporetto in Italy. These formations were then deployed to the Western front to counter the British tank attack at the Battle of Cambrai.Alexander Turner and Peter Dennis, Cambrai 1917: The birth of armoured warfare (2007) In March 1918 the German army Spring Offensive began an impressive advance creating a salient in the allied line. The offensive stalled as the British and French fell back and then counterattacked. The Germans did not have the airpower or tanks to secure their battlefield gains.Phil Tomaseli, Lys 1918: Estaires And Givenchy, The: German Spring Offensives (2011) The Allies, invigorated by American manpower, money, and food, counterattacked in late summer and rolled over the depleted German lines, as the German navy rebelled and support for the war on the homefront evaporated. Weimar Republic and the Third Reich (1918‚Äì39) The treaty of Versailles imposed severe restrictions on Germany's military strength. The army was limited to one hundred thousand men with an additional fifteen thousand in the navy. The fleet was to consist of at most six battleships, six cruisers, and twelve destroyers, and the Washington Naval Treaty established severe tonnage restrictions for German warships. Tanks and heavy artillery were forbidden and the air force was dissolved. A new post-war military (Reichswehr) was established in March 1921. General conscription was not allowed. The new Weimar Republic had to follow these restrictions, which worsened its already low public esteem.William Mulligan, The Creation of the Modern German Army: General Walther Reinhardt and the Weimar Republic, 1914‚Äì1930 (2004) General Hans von Seeckt the Army Commander, used the lessons of the First World War and the latest technology to develop advanced tactical doctrines, more efficient organizational structures, and better training that kept the small army ready for expansion. The government secretly trained soldiers in the Soviet Union, but otherwise generally followed the Versailles restrictions while retaining a strong cadre of officers and senior non- coms.James S. Corum, The Roots of Blitzkrieg: Hans von Seeckt and German Military Reform (1994) The Nazis came to power in 1933 and began remilitarisation. Heavy military spending quickly restored the depression- ravaged economy, making Adolf Hitler popular with the people and the military. German armed forces were named the Wehrmacht from 1935 to 1945. The Army (Heer) was encouraged to experiment with tanks and motorised infantry, using the ideas of Heinz Guderian. The Kriegsmarine restarted naval construction and Hitler established the Luftwaffe, an independent air force. Threats to use military force were a staple in Nazi foreign policy. They were not actually used except as German involvement in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39), where the Luftwaffe gained important combat experience. Second World War (1939‚Äì45) Farrell argues that the historiography of the army in World War Two has been \\"extremely difficult\\" because of the stark dichotomy between its superb combat performance and the horrors of its destruction and crimes against civilians and prisoners.Kevin W. Farrell, \\"Recent Approaches to the German Army of World War II: Is the Topic More Accessible after 65 Years?\\" Global War Studies (2010) 7#2 pp 131‚Äì156 online At first Germany's military moves were brilliantly successful, as in the \\"blitzkrieg\\" invasions of Poland (1939), Norway and Denmark (1940), the Low Countries (1940), and above all the stunningly successful invasion and quick conquest of France in 1940. Hitler probably wanted peace with Britain in late 1940, but Winston Churchill, standing alone, was dogged in his defiance. Churchill had major financial, military, and diplomatic help from President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the U.S., another implacable foe of Hitler. Rising tensions with the Soviet Union eventually led Germany to launch a full-scale invasion of its former ally in June 1941. Hitler's insistence on maintaining high living standards postponed the full mobilization of the national economy until 1942, years after the great rivals Britain, Russia, and the U.S. had fully mobilized. In September 1939, Germany invaded Poland using new tactics that combining the use of tanks, motorised infantry, and air support ‚Äì known as Blitzkrieg ‚Äì caused Polish resistance to collapse within weeks especially once the soviets attacked later that same month from the East.Britain and France declared war but over the winter of 1939‚Äì40 there was very little combat in what was called the Phoney War. In April 1940, in Operation Weser√ºbung, German combined air, land and sea forces invaded and occupied neutral Denmark with little fighting. Then they fought a successful Norwegian Campaign against the British and Norwegian forces to conquer Norway and to secure access to the North Sea and to Swedish iron ore. Sweden remained neutral throughout the war, but Finland fought two wars against the Soviets and became a German ally.Andrew Roberts, The Storm of War: A New History of the Second World War (2011) pp 29‚Äì42 =France= The French plans were largely based on a static defense behind the Maginot Line ‚Äì a series of formidable defensive forts along the French- German border.Robert A. Doughty, The Breaking Point: Sedan and the Fall of France, 1940 (1990) ch 1 German General Erich von Manstein thought on an idea which led eventually to the approval of a Sichelschnitt ('Sickle Cut') plan to the conquest of France. On 10 May 1940 the Germans bypassed the Maginot Line by launching another Blitzkrieg through neutral Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands, drawing the Allied forces out. The main thrust of the Battle of France attack however was through the Ardennes which were to that time believed impenetrable to tanks. The British Expeditionary Force and other allied units were driven back to the coast at Dunkirk, but managed to escape with most of their troops when Germany made a mistaken decision not to attack with tanks. In June 1940, with French troops encircled and cut off in the north, France asked for an armistice that allowed Germany to control most of the French coast and left Vichy France under German domination.Alistair Horne, To Lose a Battle: France 1940 (1969) pp 646‚Äì66 =Battle of Britain= Hitler at least wanted to threaten an invasion of Britain, perhaps to force a peace, so an armada of small boats and a large combat force was assembled in northern France. The Battle of Britain was of basic strategic significance, for Berlin believed that it could defeat Britain only by physical invasion by the Army, codenamed Operation Sea Lion. The British Army had rescued its soldiers at Dunkirk but lost most of its equipment and weapons, and was no match for the fully equipped German army. The invasion could succeed only if the Luftwaffe could guarantee the Royal Navy would not be able to attack the landing force. To do so, the Royal Air Force had to be defeated. The Battle took place August to September 1940. The Luftwaffe used 1300 medium bombers guarded by 900 fighters; they made 1500 sorties a day from bases in France, Belgium and Norway. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had 650 fighters, with more being produced every day. Thanks to radar technology, the British knew where the Germans were, and could concentrate their counterattacks.Anthony J. Cumming, \\"Did Radar Win the Battle of Britain?\\" Historian, 2007 69#4 pp 688‚Äì705 The Germans used their strategic bombing doctrine to focus on RAF airfields and radar stations. After the RAF bomber forces (quite separate from the fighter forces) attacked Berlin and other cities (a war crime), Hitler swore revenge and diverted the Luftwaffe to attacks on London (a war crime). The success the Luftwaffe was having in rapidly wearing down the RAF was squandered, as the civilians being hit were far less critical than the airfields and radar stations that were now ignored.Civilian deaths were 300 to 600 a day, plus 1000 to 3000 injured. London was not a factory city and aircraft production went up. The last German daylight raid was September 30; the Luftwaffe was taking unacceptable losses and broke off the attacks; occasional air raids hit London and other cities from time to time before May 1941, killing over 42,000 civilians. The Luftwaffe lost 1733 planes, the British, 915. The British showed more determination, better radar, and better ground control, while the Germans violated their own doctrine with wasted attacks on London.Arnold D. Harvey, \\"The Battle of Britain, in 1940 and 'Big Week,' in 1944: A Comparative Perspective,\\" Air Power History (2012) 59#1 pp 34‚Äì45 The British surprised the Germans with their high quality aircraft; flying close to home bases where they could refuel, and using radar as part of an integrated air defense system, they had a significant advantage over German aircraft operating at long ranges. The Hawker Hurricane fighter played a vital role for the RAF in winning the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940. A fast, heavily armed monoplane that went into service in 1937, the Hurricane was effective against both German fighters and bombers and accounted for 70‚Äì75% of German losses during the battle of Britain. The Germans immediately pulled out their Stukas, which were no match against the Hurricanes and Spitfires. The Battle of Britain showed the world that Hitler's vaunted war machine could be defeated. Barley (2004) identifies numerous failures by the German high command. Hitler was indecisive, failing to identify a political goal that would define the military mission. Luftwaffe planning was muddled, and overlooked the important lessons learned in Spain. The operation was poorly supported by German intelligence. Germany failed to adhere to two key principles of war: know your enemy and yourself, and select and maintain your aim.M. P. Barley, \\"Contributing to its Own Defeat: The Luftwaffe and the Battle of Britain,\\" Defence Studies, Autumn 2004, Vol. 4#3 pp 387‚Äì411 =Balkans= To support their weakened Italian allies who had started several invasions, in early 1941 Germany deployed troops in Greece, Yugoslavia and North Africa. In the Balkans it was a matter of guerrilla war which was extremely violent on all sides.Robert M. Kennedy, Hold the Balkans!: German Antiguerrilla Operations in the Balkans 1941‚Äì1944 (2001) These deployments disrupted Berlin's timetable, and delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union. =Operation Barbarossa= Hitler made the fateful decision to invade Russia in early 1941, but was delayed by the need to take control of the Balkans. Europe was not big enough for both Hitler and Stalin, and Hitler realized the sooner he moved the less risk of American involvement. Stalin thought he had a long-term partnership and rejected information coming from all directions that Germany was about to invade in June 1941. As a result, the Russians were poorly prepared and suffered huge losses, being pushed back to Moscow by December before holding the line. Hitler imagined that the Soviet Union was a hollow shell that would easily collapse, like France. He therefore had not prepared for a long war, and did not have sufficient winter clothing and gear for his soldiers.Ian Kershaw, Fateful Choices: Ten Decisions That Changed the World, 1940‚Äì1941 (2007)Gerhard L. Weinberg, A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II (1994) ch 5 Weinberg (1994) argues that decisions concerning the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 must be understood in the broader context of Hitler's ideological motivations and long-term goals. Although Hitler had decided to invade the Soviet Union as early as 1940, German resources never reflected this; armaments production, tank and aircraft construction, and logistical preparations focused on the West. Diplomatic activity was similarly skewed; Hitler granted Stalin any territory he wanted (such as Lithuania), knowing they would soon be at war and Germany would reclaim it anyway. Hitler, blinded by his racist prejudices against Slavs, believed the Eastern campaign would be quick and easy. His real strategic concern was Great Britain and the United States, and his planning consistently demonstrated this.Weinberg, A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II (1994) pp 122‚Äì86 The Axis- controlled territory in Europe at the time of its maximal expansion (1941‚Äì42).The Balkan operation had caused a delay, and about six weeks later than planned, on 22 June 1941, Germany reneged on its non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union and launched Operation Barbarossa. The German army and its allies made enormous territorial gains in the first months of the war, reaching the outskirts of Moscow when winter set in. Expecting another Blitzkrieg victory, the Germans had not properly prepared for warfare in winter and over long distances.David M. Glantz, Operation Barbarossa: Hitler's Invasion of Russia 1941 (2011)ch 1 =High Point and Collapse= The years 1941/1942 saw the high point for the German army which controlled an area from France to deep into Russia, and from Norway to western Egypt. Consequently, it also proved to be the turning point. The harsh Russian winters and long supply lines worked in Russia's favour and German armies were decisively defeated in early 1943 at Stalingrad and later in the gigantic tank battle at Kursk.Mark Healy, Kursk 1943: The Tide Turns In The East (1992) ch 6 British and American forces cut off reinforcements to North Africa, defeated Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, and captured the German and Italian forces there.Dennis E. Showalter, Patton And Rommel: Men of War in the Twentieth Century (2006) ch 1 Hitler was technologically oriented and promoted a series of new secret weapons, such as the jet plane, the jet-powered missile (V-1), the rocket-powered missile (V-2), and vastly improved submarines. However he failed to support development of nuclear weapons or proximity fuses, and trailed the Allies in radar. He failed to take advantage of the German lead in jet planes.Ian V. Hogg, German Secret Weapons of World War II (2006)ch 1 In early 1943 the Soviet victory at Stalingrad marked the beginning of the end, as Germany was unable to cope with the superior manpower and industrial resources of the Allies. North Africa, Sicily, and southern Italy fell in 1943. Hitler rescued Mussolini from prison. Mussolini set up a new \\"Salo Republic\\" but he was a mere puppet, as German forces blocked the Allies from the industrial northern third of Italy. The Russians pushed forward relentlessly in the East, while the Allies in the west launched a major bombing campaign in 1944‚Äì45 that destroyed all major and many smaller German cities, ruined transportation, and signaled to Germans how hopeless their cause was. The Allies invaded France in June 1944 as the Russians launched another attack on the east. Both attacks were successful and by the end of 1944, the end was in sight. Hitler did launch a surprise attack at the Bulge in December 1944; it was his last major initiative and it failed, as Allied armor rolled into Germany. Disregarding his generals, Hitler rejected withdrawals and retreats, counting more and more on nonexistent armies. Hitler committed suicide in his underground bunker in Berlin as his last soldiers were overwhelmed by Soviet armies in intensely bloody battles overhead.Antony Beevor, The Fall of Berlin 1945 (2003) ch 1  Cold War (1945‚Äì89)  Occupation zones of Germany in 1945. Among the legacies of the Nazi era were the Nuremberg Trials of 1945‚Äì1949. These established the concept of war crimes in international law and created the precedent for trying future war criminals. =West Germany= In 1949, West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) was formed from the French, British and American zones, while the Soviet zone formed East Germany (German Democratic Republic). The western territory of Germany fell under the protection of the NATO alliance in the west, while the eastern state joined the Warsaw Pact. Each state possessed its own military force, with eastern Germany formed along the Soviet model and federal Germany adopting a more 'western' organisation. The allied zones of Berlin became de facto part of the Federal Republic of Germany despite the city's location deep in the German Democratic Republic. That resulted in a special situation for Berlin, i.e. the draft was not in effect in West Berlin. This condition continued until 1990 when the two states were reunited. Konrad Adenauer, Theodor Blank, Adolf Heusinger and Hans Speidel inspect formations of the newly created Bundeswehr on 20 January 1955 The Bundeswehr was established in 1955 in West Germany. In 1956, conscription for all men between 18 and 45 in years was introduced after heavy discussions about re- militarising Germany. A significant exception came from the conscientious objector clause in the West German constitution: West Germany was the first country to grant alternative service to all men who objected to military service on ethical grounds, regardless of religious affiliation. This was named \\"Zivildienst\\" roughly translated as \\"civil services\\". Cold War analysts considered Germany the most likely location for the outbreak of a possible third world war. Tensions ran high during 1948 when the Soviet Union and \\"Sowjetische Besatzungszone\\" (Soviet Occupied Territories) closed all roads bringing supplies to West Berlin. The Berlin Airlift sustained the population and avoided a new war. Construction of the Berlin Wall was in 1961. Corps sectors of military responsibility in NATO's central region in the 1980s. During the Cold War the Bundeswehr had a strength of 495,000 military and 170,000 civilian personnel. The army consisted of three corps with 12 divisions, most of them armed with tanks and APCs. The air force owned major numbers of tactical combat aircraft and took part in NATO's integrated air defence (NATINADS). The navy was tasked to defend the \\"Baltic Approaches\\" and to contain the Soviet Baltic Fleet. The United States played a dominant role in NATO, and had its own forces stationed in Germany as well. Cooperation between the two militaries was extensive and cordial. Joint exercises and close collaboration allowed the German and American armies to learn from each other regarding strategy, tactics and technology.A. J. Birtle, Rearming the Phoenix: U.S. Military Assistance to the Federal Republic of Germany, 1950‚Äì1960 (1991), 131‚Äì249. However, there were failures when it came to a joint venture in tank design in the 1960s, and the lack of cooperation in developing infantry fighting vehicles.Ingo Wolfgang Trauschweizer, \\"Learning with an Ally: The U.S. Army and the Bundeswehr in the Cold War,\\" Journal of Military History (2008) 72#2 pp 477‚Äì508 online =East Germany= In East Germany, the Nationale Volksarmee (National People's Army) or NVA was founded on 1 March 1956. It grew steadily by gradual stages from the police force in the Soviet occupation zone in 1945 until the consolidation in the defense establishment in the 1970s. It was a professional volunteer army until 1962, when conscription was introduced. In 1987 at the peak of its power, the NVA numbered 175,300 troops. Approximately 50% of this number were career soldiers, while the remaining half were short-term conscripts. The armed forces were controlled by the National Defense Council, except that the mobile forces were under the Warsaw Pact Unified Command. Political control of the armed forces was through close integration with the SED (Communist Party), which vetted all the officers. Popular support for the military establishment was bolstered by military training provided by the school system and through the growing militarization of society. From a Leninist perspective, the NVA stood as a symbol of Soviet-East German solidarity and became the model Communist institution‚Äîideological, hierarchical, and disciplined.Emily O. Goldman and Leslie C. Eliason, The diffusion of military technology and ideas (2003) p 132 The NVA synthesized Communist and Germanic symbolism, naming its officers' academy after Marx's coauthor Friedrich Engels, and its highest medal after Prussian General Gerhard von Scharnhorst.Alan L. Nothnagle, Building the East German myth (1999) p 176 At the critical moment in its history in November 1989, the NVA rallied to its Germanic heritage and rejected Communism, refusing to battle the demonstrators protesting the Communist regime. Mikhail Gorbachev refused to let Soviet troops become engaged, and so not just the leadership but the entire Communist system in East Germany collapsed, and the country was soon absorbed by West Germany.Dale Roy Herspring, Requiem for an army: the demise of the East German military (1998) p 2  Post-Cold War to present-day  =German reunification= 180px In the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (1990), Germany agreed to reduce the strength of its combined armed forces to no more than 370,000 men. After reunification, the Bundeswehr absorbed parts of the Nationale Volksarmee of the GDR, which was being dissolved. In 1999, the NATO war on Yugoslavia in Kosovo was the first offensive conflict in which the German military actively took part since the Second World War. In 2000, the European Court of Justice opened up the previously all-male (besides medical divisions and the music corps) Bundeswehr to women. Since the early 1990s, the Bundeswehr became more engaged in international peacekeeping missions in and around the former Yugoslavia, Cambodia, Somalia, Djibouti, Georgia, and Sudan. = War on terrorism = As part of Operation Enduring Freedom as a response to those attacks, Germany deployed approximately 2,250 troops including KSK special forces, naval vessels and NBC cleanup teams to Afghanistan. German forces have contributed to ISAF, the NATO force in Afghanistan, and a Provincial Reconstruction Team.Vincent Morelli and Paul Belkin, NATO in Afghanistan: A Test of the Transatlantic Alliance (Congressional Research Service, 2009) p. 22 German army CH-53 helicopters have deployed to Afghanistan, one crashed in December 2002 in Kabul, killing seven German soldiers. Eleven other German soldiers have been killed: four in two different ordnance-defusing accidents, one in a vehicle accident, five in two separate suicide bombings, and one in landmine explosion. German forces were in the more secure north of the country and Germany, along with some other larger European countries (with the exception of the UK, Estonia, the Netherlands and Norway), and were criticised for not taking part in the more intensive combat operations in southern Afghanistan in 2006.Canada gives Afghanistan warning, afghannews.net =Reorientation of the Bundeswehr= A major event for the German military was the suspension of the compulsory conscription for men in 2011. In 2011/12, a major reform of the Bundeswehr was announced, further limiting the number of military bases and soldiers. As of December 2012, the number of active military personnel in the Bundeswehr was down to 191,818, corresponding to a ratio of 2.3 active soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants. Military expenditure in Germany was at ‚Ç¨31.55 billion in 2011, corresponding to 1.2% of GDP. Both the number of active soldiers and the military expenditure placed Germany below comparable countries of the European Union such as France and the United Kingdom. While this was already true in absolute terms, the difference was even more pronounced when taking into account Germany's larger population and economy. Thus, Germany appears less prepared to pay for the military and to attach less importance to defense than comparable countries. This stance often draws criticism from Germany's military allies, especially the United States. In May 2016, the German government announced it would spend ‚Ç¨130 billion on new equipment by 2030 and add nearly 7,000 soldiers by 2023 in the first German military expansion since the end of the Cold War. In February 2017, the German government announced another expansion, which would increase the number of its professional soldiers by 20,000 by 2024. =Reduction of foreign armed forces= Whereas Soviet/Russian soldiers fully withdrew from reunified Germany after the Cold War, the United States have only reduced their forces, maintaining a contingent of 47,761 troops as of 2012. The British Armed Forces will discontinue their deployment in Germany by 2020. French soldiers will continue to be deployed on German soil as a part of the Franco-German Brigade.

It inhabits shrubland, grassland and wetland habitats. On the IUCN Red List, it is listed as Least Concern because of its wide distribution and stable population. Its common name refers to the traditional placement in the Old World babbler family Timaliidae although the genus Chrysomma forms a clade along with the parrotbills within the family Paradoxornithidae.J√∏nsson, K. A., Fjelds√•, J. (2006). A phylogenetic supertree of oscine passerine birds (Aves: Passeri). Zoologica Scripta 35 (2): 149‚Äì186. Description In typical habitat of grass, note the yellow nostril. (Hodal, Haryana) The yellow-eyed babbler is about long with a short bill and a long graduated tail. The body above is brown and the wings are cinnamon coloured. The lores and supercilium are white and the rim of the eye is orange-yellow in adult birds. The beak is black. The underside is whitish buff. The central tail feathers are about twice as long as the outermost. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Within its wide distribution range there are some differences in plumages between populations that have been considered as subspecies. The nominate subspecies is found in Burma, Laos and Thailand. The population in Sri Lanka, nasale, has black nostrils and a stouter bill. The population across much of India, hypoleucum, has yellow nostrils (as with the nominate subspecies) and is paler in plumage. The population in the northeast Duars of India has an almost slaty crown and darker wings and has been called as saturatius or saturatior but this is considered as clinal variation and included in the nominate population. Distribution and habitat The range of the yellow-eyed babbler extends from Pakistan through India, Nepal, Sri Lanka to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Viet Nam and China. The usual habitat is grassy or thorny scrub both in dry and wet regions as well as farmland. It occurs mainly on the plains but also in the lower hills . It is absent in the dense forest region of the Western Ghats and occurs only on the eastern edges or in gaps such as at Palghat. Behaviour and ecology Perched on grass (Hodal, India) Like babblers, these birds are usually seen in small groups of five to fifteen, especially in the non-breeding season. They are usually found inside bushes, emerging up to the top of a stem and then diving back into cover to forage. They feed mainly on insects but take berries (Lantana and Salvadora) as well as nectar. When capturing insects, they may hold them down with their feet. The group constantly produces a series of cheeping or churring calls. During the breeding season, mainly the southwest monsoon (June to August) but sometimes during the receding monsoon, the song is a strong whistling twee-twee-ta-whit-chu, often delivered from a prominent perch. The colour of the inside of the mouth is said to turn from orange-brown to black during the breeding season. They appear to nest cooperatively, the nest being a deep cone made with grass and lined with fine fibre. The nest is wedged between upright stems, the vertical stems being incorporated into the wall of the nest. The outside of the nest is well covered in cobwebs. The usual clutch is four but varies from three to five. The eggs are pinkish white with chestnut-red patches. Both parents take part in incubation and feeding the young. The eggs hatch after about 15‚Äì16 days and the young birds fledge after about 13 days. Adult birds have been seen feigning injury presumably to detract predators. Birds roost communally in the centre of a bush, all facing in the same direction and sitting side by side. Members of a group will preen each other. In an apparent territorial display, a pair of birds were found to sing while facing another singing pair and they all simultaneously bobbed their heads while perching on legs held straight to appear tall. Shikras may sometimes attempt to prey on these birds. Known in parts of northern India as gulab chashm meaning \\"yellow spectacles\\", they were sometimes kept as cagebirds.

The New South Wales Teachers Federation represents all teachers in NSW public pre-schools, infants, primary and secondary schools and TAFE (technical and further education) Institutes. Teachers in Schools for Specific Purposes, Adult Migrant Education Service (AMES) and Corrective Services are also members. About the union The New South Wales Teachers Federation is affiliated to the Australian Education Union (AEU), the national union covering public school teachers in Australia and through that organisation to Education International and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The New South Wales Teachers Federation is also affiliated to Unions New South Wales. The NSW Teachers Federation is not affiliated to any political party. The New South Wales Teachers Federation is based at Surry Hills near the Sydney CBD. The union also has regional offices in Blacktown, Bathurst, Dubbo, Lismore, Newcastle, Port Macquarie, Queanbeyan, Tamworth, Wagga Wagga and Wollongong. The membership includes about 41,000 full-time teachers, 15,000 casual and unemployed members, and 6,000 TAFE teachers. The total membership stands at about 67,000. The state council of the union consists of approximately 300 locally elected delegates. The union's annual conference consists of approximately 600 delegates. The NSW Teachers Federation executive is elected by the state council. The secretariat of the Federation is composed of 47 officers who are elected by the council for a three-year term. They perform such jobs as organiser, industrial advocate, welfare officer and research officer, supporting the Federation's membership. The three Presidential officers ‚Äì President, Deputy President, and Senior Vice-President ‚Äì are elected by the whole membership every two years. The NSW Teachers Federation looks after a multiplicity of issues on behalf of teachers. It is responsible for negotiating the salaries and working conditions of its members with the New South Wales government. The union is committed to the interests of public education, although its primary concern is salaries and working conditions of its members. Stewart House is the official charity of the NSW Teachers Federation. History =Establishment and the early years= Throughout its history, Federation has campaigned long and hard on issues affecting public education, teachers' salaries and teachers' working conditions, those issues which are at the heart of teaching as a profession in New South Wales. The first Annual Conference of Federation in 1919 had listed as part of the agenda \\"inadequacy of teachers' salaries, understaffing of schools, unwieldiness of classes, insufficiency of accommodation, conducting of classes in sheds, corridors and unsuitable rooms to the detriment of the health of teachers and pupils\\". Other matters included \\"unhealthy congestion of school population in overgrown suburban schools, as against decentralisation into schools with a maximum enrolment of one thousand, the high percentage of unclassified and insufficiently trained teachers, inadequacy of supervision by heads of departments owing to class duties and absence of schools for the mentally disabled\\". Throughout this century, Federation has continued to campaign on these issues. In the years immediately following its establishment, Federation was concerned to increase its membership. In 1920 the membership of the Federation was 5,600 or 78% of the total membership of the Department of Education. In 1996 membership is about 64,000. This number includes permanent full-time school, TAFE teachers, AMES teachers, part-time school, TAFE, AMES and casual teachers as well as those teachers in other associated groups. It was not until 1937 that the first organiser was appointed, following an Annual Conference decision of 1936 that stated \\"we are firmly of the opinion that, for a really effective increase in membership, it is necessary that some person be employed for the whole of their time organising the schools\\". More officers were progressively appointed. There were 43 full-time administrative officers in 1996, who serviced the needs of the membership and undertook recruitment activities. =1960s-present day= In 1961, 241,000 signatories for a National Education Petition were presented to the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, calling for Commonwealth funding to state schools. This was the culmination of a long campaign begun in the 1940s, to encourage the Commonwealth Government to fund certain programs in State schools. To this day such programs are funded by the Commonwealth Government. This number of signatories was a record which was only broken in 1993 by a petition calling for private health insurance to be tax deductible. Over the years to 1968, the year of Federation's first general strike, the Union campaigned on the theme of \\"United Action\\", emphasising a community of interest between different sectors of the membership and the community, in policy development. Political, industrial and professional issues concerning public education were given focus and emphasis. There were significant advances ‚Äì in 1946, for example, there was a major salaries breakthrough for teachers which gave the first realistic salary increases since 1920 and set the standard for other professional workers. The average gain was over 100 pounds for men and 80 pounds for women. The federation made a major break with the past in 1968, its 50th anniversary, when the first statewide strike was called over the conditions in which teachers were working. NSW Teachers Federation campaign. Since the 1990s, the NSW Teachers Federation has campaigned to support public education in the face of rapidly expanding government funding for private schools. In partnership with parents and principals, the Teachers Federation has engaged in political lobbying and advertising in support of public schools.

One of the main uses of the idea of an asymptotic distribution is in providing approximations to the cumulative distribution functions of statistical estimators. Definition A sequence of distributions corresponds to a sequence of random variables Zi for i = 1, 2, ..., I . In the simplest case, an asymptotic distribution exists if the probability distribution of Zi converges to a probability distribution (the asymptotic distribution) as i increases: see convergence in distribution. A special case of an asymptotic distribution is when the sequence of random variables is always zero or Zi = 0 as i approaches infinity. Here the asymptotic distribution is a degenerate distribution, corresponding to the value zero. However, the most usual sense in which the term asymptotic distribution is used arises where the random variables Zi are modified by two sequences of non-random values. Thus if :Y_i=\\\\frac{Z_i-a_i}{b_i} converges in distribution to a non-degenerate distribution for two sequences {ai} and {bi} then Zi is said to have that distribution as its asymptotic distribution. If the distribution function of the asymptotic distribution is F then, for large n, the following approximations hold :P\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z_n-a_n}{b_n} \\\\le x \\\\right) \\\\approx F(x) , :P(Z_n \\\\le z) \\\\approx F\\\\left(\\\\frac{z-a_n}{b_n}\\\\right) . If an asymptotic distribution exists, it is not necessarily true that any one outcome of the sequence of random variables is a convergent sequence of numbers. It is the sequence of probability distributions that converges. Central limit theorem Perhaps the most common distribution to arise as an asymptotic distribution is the normal distribution. In particular, the central limit theorem provides an example where the asymptotic distribution is the normal distribution. ;Central limit theorem: :Suppose {X1, X2, ...} is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with E[Xi] = ¬µ and Var[Xi] = œÉ2 < ‚àû. Let Sn be the average of {X1, ..., Xn}. Then as n approaches infinity, the random variables (Sn ‚àí ¬µ) converge in distribution to a normal N(0, œÉ2): The central limit theorem gives only an asymptotic distribution. As an approximation for a finite number of observations, it provides a reasonable approximation only when close to the peak of the normal distribution; it requires a very large number of observations to stretch into the tails. =Local asymptotic normality= Local asymptotic normality is a generalization of the central limit theorem. It is a property of a sequence of statistical models, which allows this sequence to be asymptotically approximated by a normal location model, after a rescaling of the parameter. An important example when the local asymptotic normality holds is in the case of independent and identically distributed sampling from a regular parametric model; this is just the central limit theorem. Barndorff-Nielson & Cox provide a direct definition of asymptotic normality.

It is a part of a conspicuous and isolated cluster of hills, forming a promontory, 38 km north of Kannur (Cannanore) . As the former capital of the ancient Mushika Kingdom, Ezhimala is considered to be an important historical site. A flourishing seaport and center of trade around the beginning of the Common Era, it was also one of the major battlefields of the Chola-Chera Wars, in the 11th century. It is believed by some that Lord Buddha had visited Ezhimala. Etymology Th hills is also known as Elimala, Mooshika Sailam and Sapta Sailam. The hill had been named Monte d'Eli by the Portuguese. and was known as Mount Delly or Mount Eli to the British. Backwaters in Ezhimala History Ezhimala, which is part of Ramanthali panchayath, is one of the most important places in the recorded history of north Malabar. From before the period of known history, some chapters of the Ramayana and local Hindu legends associate the Ezhimala Hills with the famous epic, in particular with lord Hanuman. Ezhimala, Pazhayangadi, and several villages and towns in this region find plenty of mention in the extant Tamil Sangam Period's literature (500 BC to 300 AD). Pazhayangadi is the present corrupted form of its ancient name of Pazhi. Pazhi is mentioned as the ancient capital of King Udayan Venmon Nannan (known as Nannan or Nandan) of the Mushika or Kolathiri Royal Family. Though the Dynasty of Nannans was a cousin or sister dynasty of the Cheras and Pandyas and Cholas, warfare among them was nearly consistent, and the period of Nannan was no exception. There are texts that speak of Nannan fighting heroic battles at Pazhi against the Chera Kings who invaded his kingdom (Kolathunadu). Eventually, Nannan was killed in battle by the Chera king, Narmudi Cheral. Like the other kings of the then Tamilakam cultural polity, Narmudi Cheral was a great patron of scholars and poets, and he once gifted his court-poet, Kappiyattu Kappiyanar with 40 lakhs gold coins, as a token of his poetic genius. Extant Tamil Sangam texts describe the glory and wealth of the ancient Pazhi in the highest terms. Sangam Era poets, as well as Classical Tamil poets of later centuries, like Paranar speak of the wealth of Pazhi in the greatest degree. One of the Sangam pieces, Akam 173 speaks of \\"Nannan's great mountain slopes where gold fields abound, and long bamboos dried in the Sun burst and released the unfinished pearls.\\" Noted scholar, Elamkulam Kunjan Pillai states that \\"It is from Kottayam (of North Malabar) and Cannanore regions of old Ezhimalainad that innumerable Roman (gold) coins have been excavated. On one (single) occasion (gold) coins that could be carried by six porters were obtained. These coins were found to belong to the period down to 491 AD\\". Ezhimala was also a flourishing seaport and center of trade at least by the start of the Common Era; and later was also one of the major battlefields of the series of Chola-Chera Wars in the 11th century; some believe that Lord Buddha had visited Ezhimala. Mooshika Vamsham, written by Athulan in the 11th century, throws light on the recorded past of the Mushika Royal Family up until that point. The first recorded king of Mooshika Vamsham (the Mooshika Dynasty) was Ramaghata Mooshika and his capital most probably was Pazhi (ancient Pazhayangadi). Athulan describes the later kings of this dynasty who are now better known as the Kolathiri Dynasty. King Ramaghata Mooshika's successors shifted their capital to Ezhimala, Valabhapattanam (Valapattanam), and eventually Chirakkal, among other nearby places, over the following centuries. Indian Naval Academy The Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, inaugurated the Indian Naval Academy in Ezhimala, which is the largest in Asia, on 8 January 2009. This institution trains officer candidates of the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard.http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=46464&kwd;= Transportation The national highway passes through Perumba junction.

Responsibility for the operation of the Institute, which is located in Barbados, rests with the sixteen Commonwealth Governments which comprise the CMO. History In 1951 the British Caribbean Meteorological Service was established to promote and co-ordinate regional activities in the fields of meteorology and allied sciences, to provide support and advice to governments in dealing with issues of an international nature affecting weather and climate and to represent the regional meteorological community's interests at the international level. With the dissolution of the West Indies Federation in 1962, the Caribbean Meteorological Service (CMS) was formed in 1963. In 1973, the CMS became the Caribbean Meteorological Organisation (CMO) following the independence of several member states.

The focal point of the mall is a four-storey-high rotunda, including a time capsule at the centre's axis, set to be opened on December 31, 2999. History Logo used until October 2015 In 1960, with Calgary's population and city limits rapidly expanding, the first section of Chinook Centre was opened August 16 on the site of the Chinook Drive-In Theatre and the adjacent Skyline drive-in and driving range. Designed as an open-air complex, the mall was anchored by Woodward's, Holt Renfrew, a bowling alley, and a branch of the Calgary Public Library. In the mid-1960s, a separate mall, Southridge, was opened across the street from Chinook. Built to be a competing centre with Sears and approximately 30 other stores, Southridge operated separately until 1974, when the malls came under common ownership and an expansion was built to bridge the centres together. The new, larger mall was renamed Chinook Ridge Shopping Centre, and included a major enclosed parking structure, a movie theatre, an office tower, and a food court. Time capsule's cover plate at the four-storey rotunda In the 1980s, a two-storey wing of specialty retailers was added leading to a new anchor store (fashion retailer Bretton's, since closed) and a new food court. This expansion brought the mall's store count to approximately 300. A popular feature of the mall was an indoor merry-go-round, which was initially located outside the entrance to The Bay; following the 2000s renovation (see below), the attraction was relocated to the expanded food court. The construction of a pedestrian bridge from the food court required the removal of the carousel in the late 2010s. =2000 overhaul= In the late 1990s, Chinook Centre underwent a $300 million, three-year renovation. The complex was completely rebuilt in three phases, and added new stores for Sears, The Bay and Zellers, as well as the south parkade and theatre complex. The former Chinook Movie Theatre location, which had closed in the early 1990s and converted into a large gaming arcade, became a much-expanded food hall. The move to larger format retailers reduced the number of stores to approximately 200. This re-merchandising program was unkind to smaller, locally owned businesses who were squeezed out by the 'upscaling' of the property. Some relocated to strip malls located near Chinook for a time. =2010 expansion= On September 29, 2010, a major 2-level expansion was opened. The new wing added approximately 60 new retailers, many of which were new to the Calgary market or considered high-end luxury brand stores.Chinook expansion to include first Abercrombie & Fitch in Calgary The expansion increased the number of retailers to 250, and added two levels of underground parking. =Pedestrian and transit access= Until the late 2010s, pedestrian access to the mall from east of Macleod Trail was facilitated by way of a thin pedestrian bridge, an underground tunnel, and an at-grade crosswalk. Use of these three options grew after the City's CTrain station was built approximately five blocks east of the mall (a location dictated by the placement of existing rail lines). Concerns over pedestrian safety resulted in a large pedestrian bridge being constructed in the late 2010s; running more than a block, it connects the Dining Hall on the second level to 61st Avenue, which in turn takes pedestrians to the CTrain station. In late 2018, the pedestrian tunnel was closed due to safety concerns, and the new bridge allowed the removal of the at-grade crosswalk at Macleod and 61st.

There he assisted in the construction of the first sailing vessel built in what would become the state of Oregon, sailed the ship to California to trade for cattle, and later served as one of three co- executives (\\"governors\\") in the Provisional Government of Oregon. Originally a sailor, he also spent time in the fur trade, as a farmer, and a gold miner in the California Gold Rush. Early life Joseph Gale was born in Washington, D.C., on April 29, 1807, the son of Mary Gale (n√©e Goff) and Joseph Gale, a sea captain from Pennsylvania. Both of his parents died when Joseph was young, but he did receive an education and some training as a sailor. Gale arrived on the Pacific Coast as early as 1828 with the Bean-Sinclair party that had been shipwrecked off the coast of California. From 1830 until 1839, the heyday of the Rocky Mountain fur trade, he was a well regarded trapper and an associate of western legends such as Ewing Young, Nathaniel Wyeth, Joe Meek, Jim Bridger, and Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce Indians. Fur trapper and trader As early as 1830, Joseph Gale had traveled to Taos and was fur trapping and trading in the southern Rocky Mountains. In October 1831, he departed Santa Fe as a member of Ewing Young's second trip to California. The goal of this expedition was to export horses and mules from California for sale in the Missouri Valley, and do some trapping of beaver and perhaps hunting sea otter on the side. Whether Gale went all the way to California, or remained at the Colorado River to wait for the returning party is unclear. However, Gale likely accompanied David Jackson and the California livestock back to New Mexico, arriving in July 1832. A year later, in July 1833, Gale was at the fur trapper's Rendezvous at Green River in present-day Wyoming, where he joined Joseph Walker's expedition to California. The expedition traveled from the Great Salt Lake to California by way of the Humboldt River, crossing the Sierra Nevada near the Yosemite Valley. Traversing the rough mountain terrain in October took a month. In November, Walker and company finally reached the Pacific Ocean. In February 1834, the Joseph Walker party began its return trip to the Rocky Mountains, but Gale stayed behind in California. He instead joined his friend Ewing Young on his historic cattle drive from California to Oregon, along with of Oregon promoter Hall Jackson Kelley. The Ewing Young party, and the first cattle introduced to Oregon, reached the Willamette Valley in October 1834. Less than a month later, Gale and a \\"picked up lot\\" were hired by Nathaniel Wyeth and traveled to Fort Hall in present-day Idaho. Gale was soon leading a \\"spring hunt\\" in the Rockies north of the Great Salt Lake. In the fall of 1835, Gale lead his party of men to the Gallatin River, where they had a bloody encounter with Blackfeet Indians. Gale and his party, Kit Carson, Joe Meek, and several others were fortunate to survive the encounter. Joseph Gale continued to work at Fort Hall for the next few years. After the sale of Fort Hall in August 1837, he began trapping and trading for the Hudson's Bay Company. Family life While working for Wyeth out of Fort Hall, Joseph married Eliza (native name Bear Claws), a Walla Walla Indian woman who was a daughter of Old Chief Joseph (Tu-eka-kas) of the Wallowa band of the Nez Perce and a Walla Walla mother. As such, she was the half-sister of Young Chief Joseph (Heinmot Tooyalakekt). Her given name, Eliza, may have been adopted from Eliza Spalding, co-founder of the Protestant mission at Lapwai. Joseph Gale and Eliza's first two children (Francis Ellen and Edward) were born at Fort Hall in 1837 and 1838, three more children were born in the Oregon Territory (Susan, Margaret and Mary), and three more girls (Maria Antonia, Clara and Sabrina) were born in present-day Kern County, California, during the 1850s. Oregon Country The Mission Bottom in 1834. In 1839, Joseph Gale and his family left Fort Hall and moved west of the Cascade mountains. Gale soon had a job working at the Methodist Mission sawmill in Mission Bottom. Within a year, the family had settled on the Tualatin Plains, where they were soon joined by the families of other mountain men, including Robert Newell, George W. Ebbert, Caleb Wilkins, William Doughty, and Joe Meek. With the collapse of the international market for beaver furs, the fur trappers had quit the business and were settling down in the Oregon Country. As Oregon began to attract people, the lack of a sustainable economy became a problem. Moreover, settlers were suffering from an acute livestock shortage. In 1840, a group of settlers began construction of a ship with the goal of sailing the vessel to San Francisco, and trading it for cattle to bring back north. Ship building commenced on the Star of Oregon (as it was later to be named) on Swan Island (Portland, Oregon) with Felix Hathaway hired as the ship builder. A year later, Joseph Gale was offered command of the ship and a share of the ownership. To raise capital and free his labor for its construction, Gale sold his Tualatin Valley farm and moved his family to Champoeg. All summer and fall he worked on construction of the schooner at Oregon City, where it had been relocated, which came after Hathaway quit the project and left the completion up to the remaining partners. During the winter and spring of 1841 to 42, Gale worked for the Methodist Mission, running its sawmill. In August 1842, the Star of Oregon - the first ocean-going vessel built in Oregon - left Oregon City for two weeks of practice runs on the Columbia River. In September, the ship left for California with a crew of five inexperienced men and an Indian boy with Gale as captain. On reaching San Francisco, the ship was sold for 350 cows. The following spring, Gale and 42 others drove 1,250 cattle, 600 horses and mules, and 3,000 sheep back to the Oregon Country. Partly in recognition for his accomplishment, Joseph Gale was named to the first executive committee of the Provisional Government of Oregon.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 95. Oregon‚Äôs first form of government, as implemented by the citizens‚Äô meeting at Champoeg on July 5, 1843, favored an Executive Committee instead of a single executive. The Executive Committee of 1843 was made up of David Hill, Alanson Beers, and Gale. By 1844, Joseph Gale and his family had settled on Gales Creek in Washington County, Oregon, where he established a grist mill and sawmill, perhaps using profits gained from the California cattle drive. California and the gold rush With news of the California Gold Rush, Joseph Gale moved from the Oregon Territory to California, where he lived first at Mission San Jose and later near Fort Tejon in Los Angeles County where he ran a sawmill. On January 9, 1857, Joseph Gale and family suffered the effects of the Great Fort Tejon earthquake. \\"Mr. Gale, whose dwelling is situated..(approximately 1.5 miles from) the Fort experienced a severe injury during his exertions to rescue his children from the ruins of his falling house\\". In August 1859, Gale received a permit to run a ferry over the Kern River (at Gordon's Ferry, Tulare County). Located on the main stage route from Los Angeles to San Francisco, this venture was potentially profitable. However, Gale's business activities were badly damaged with the demise of the Butterfield Overland Mail service in March 1861 and the closing of Fort Tejon in June 1861. In January 1862, a record flood washed away the ferry, stage station, and much of the road connecting San Francisco with Los Angeles. Gale abandoned the ferry and moved to Walla Walla. Return to Eastern Oregon By late 1862 Gale and his family had moved to Walla Walla, Washington Territory, where his daughter Frances and husband Thomas Page had settled. By 1868, Gale had relocated to Eagle Valley in Eastern Oregon, where he engaged in farming and other business activities related to the gold strikes in the Eagle Cap mountains. Before the Nez Perce War (1877), Young Chief Joseph and the Wallowa Nez Perce would often come and stay with Joseph and Eliza during visits to Eagle Valley, a traditional Nez Perce hunting and fishing territory. Joseph Gale died on his farm on December 13, 1881, and is buried in the Eagle Valley cemetery, Richland, Baker County, Oregon. After Gale's death, Eliza moved to the Umatilla Indian Reservation, where she died in 1905. She is buried in the Weston Cemetery in Weston, Umatilla County, Oregon, where her tombstone reads \\"1819-1905 d/o Old Chief Joseph, Nez Perce Chief. w/o Joseph Gale, Provisional Governor of Oregon 1843-1844.\\" Legacy Many landmarks have been named in his honor, including Gales Creek, Gales Peak, the small town of Gales Creek, Joseph Gale Elementary School, and Joseph Gale Park in Forest Grove.

It was the winner of the 1997 Whitbread Novel Award, and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction the same year. Plot summary Set in the Judean desert, 2000 years ago. It features 7 main characters: * Musa: a greedy trader, believed by the Galilean to be a manifestation of Satan * Miri: Musa's pregnant wife * Marta: fasting between dawn and dusk in an attempt to turn her barren womb fertile * Shim: a young traveller * Aphas: fasting between dawn and dusk in an attempt to remove the cancer from his abdomen * Badu: believed to be deaf and mute; good at catching animals * The Galilean/Gally/Jesus: aiming to fast for 40 days and nights with divine help; plagued by religious/spiritual hallucinations/visions. When Quarantine begins, the trader, Musa, is suffering from a fever in his tent in the open scrubland on the way to Jericho. There, he and his wife Miri are abandoned by their caravan, who believe him to be on the verge of death. They see a group of four travellers, some distance apart, heading in their direction. The travellers are on their way to find shelter for 40 days and 40 nights - the 'Quarantine' of the title. At night, a fifth traveller, some distance behind the first four, visits Musa in his tent. The following morning, Musa awakes to find that his fever has broken and his strength is restored. The fifth traveller, it transpires, is the young Jesus, who takes up occupancy of a hard-to-reach cave set in a hillside. Musa turns the situation to his advantage, convincing the travellers that the lands are his lands, and he their landlord. The group try in turns to coax Jesus from his cave. Convinced he is being tested by Satan, Jesus abides by his quarantine, refusing to take food or water. A series of power struggles ensues, in which Musa asserts his dominance over Aphas, Shim, his wife and eventually by raping Marta during a stormy night, having feigned illness to get her on her own. The next day, with the tent and Miri's loom having been destroyed by the storm, Musa resolves to leave for Jericho (putting his crime behind him). As he picks his way through the devastation of the camp, he sees a figure which he presumes to be Jesus walking away from the scrubland. Later, Jesus' body is found in the cave, and the group bury him in the water-hole, which Miri had originally dug as Musa's grave. Miri finds Marta, bloodied and bruised in the wilderness. They all make ready to leave, only to find that the restless Badu has escaped with Musa's goats. Aphas and Shim set off, with Miri and Marta following behind. En route, the women find the two men's packs abandoned at the side of the path. Seeing Musa approaching behind them, and sensing their opportunity to escape, they flee - making for Marta's home town. Finally, Musa is travelling across country in a wagon and believes he sees Jesus off in the distance. For a moment, he considers finding the figure to forge an alliance with him, but resolves instead to continue his business and to travel the world telling the tale of the stranger who saved his life in the tent. Reception and significance In her book The Historical Jesus and the Literary Imagination 1860‚Äì1920, Jennifer Stevens cites Quarantine as a recent \\"high\\" in the history of representations of Jesus in fiction, contrasted with the recent \\"low\\" of Jeffrey Archer's novella The Gospel According to Judas.

It is native to the Andean valleys of Chile, Ecuador, and Peru.  Description  This evergreen tree is up to 20 m tall, and has greyish-brown, fissured bark, which produces a milky white exudate. The end of branchlets and the petioles are covered with short, brown hairs. The leaves are simple, oblanceolate to elliptical, up to 25 cm long and 10 cm wide, and glabrous (or sometimes slightly hairy on the underside) grouped at the end of the branches. Flowers are solitary or in fascicles, small, axillary, with hairy sepals and a corolla forming a tube 1.0-1.8 cm long, greenish white, with five lobes, five stamens, five staminodes, a pubescent ovary, and a style 0.8-1.5 cm long. The fruit is globose, 6‚Äì12 cm long, glabrous, and russet to yellow when mature; the pulp is bright yellow; the one to several seeds are 1.8-3.5 cm long, dark brown, and glossy.Lucumas.

Uses When eaten raw, the very sweet fruit is bright yellow and has a mealy and dry texture. In Peru, it is more commonly used as a flavor in juice, milk shakes, and especially ice cream. Its unique flavor in such preparations has been described variously as being similar to sweet potato, maple syrup, or butterscotch.

The 30-degree rule is a basic film editing guideline that states the camera should move at least 30 degrees relative to the subject between successive shots of the same subject. If the camera moves less than 30 degrees, the transition between shots can look like a jump cut‚Äîwhich could jar the audience and take them out of the story. The audience might focus on the film technique rather than the narrative itself. The 30 degree change of angle makes two successive shots different enough to not look like a jump cut. However, camera movement should stay on one side of the subject to follow the 180-degree rule. Also, when thinking about the 30 degree rule, it is important to change the focal length of the lens at least 20 mm with each move you make on the axis. The 30 degree rule is often called the \\"20 mm/30 degree rule\\" for this reason. The axial cut incorporates the 20mm idea by moving the camera either closer or farther away from the subject without moving on the axis. This type of edit does not follow the 30 degree rule but deliberately breaks it to get a particular effect. Filmmakers sometimes break conventional film technique rules to achieve particular effects. French filmmaker George M√©li√®s, producer of silent black-and-white film, made films before the 30 degree rule existed. M√©li√®s inspired succeeding filmmakers to heed this rule of angle when cutting between similar or nearly identical clips. When M√®li√©s himself made his famous A Trip to the Moon (1902), he edited together film clips of the same framing and with the same angle, after changing the scene between the shots, to make it look like there was no cut at all. It was the world's first attempt to make special effects, made up of jump cuts. As Timothy Corrigan and Patricia White suggest in The Film Experience, \\"The rule aims to emphasize the motivation for the cut by giving a substantially different view of the action. The transition between two shots less than 30 degrees apart might be perceived as unnecessary or discontinuous--in short, visible.\\" There are some cases where jump cuts are used to show a passage of time or used to achieve an aesthetic style but generally filmmakers try to avoid them otherwise. The 30 degree rule is a special case of a more general dictum that states that the cut is jarring if two shots are so similar in angle and distance that it appears there is no reason for the cut. In his book In The Blink of an Eye, editor Walter Murch states: \\"[We] have difficulty accepting the kind of displacements that are neither subtle nor total: Cutting from a full-figure master shot, for instance, to a slightly tighter shot that frames the actors from the ankles up. The new shot in this case is different enough to signal that something has changed, but not different enough to make us re-evaluate its context.\\"  See also  * Film editing * Jump cut * Continuity editing * 180-degree rule * George M√©li√®s * A Trip to the Moon * Walter Murch * Axial cut References External links *\\"The 30-degree rule\\", an article explaining the 30-degree rule in depth (showcasing examples and counterexamples from various films).

Early life Michel David- Weill was born into a Jewish family on November 23, 1932. His father, Pierre David-Weill (1900‚Äì1975), was the chairman of Lazard Fr√®res; his mother was Berthe Haardt. His great-grandfather, , worked at Lazard Freres, a firm co- founded by his cousins, Alexandre, Elie, and Simon Lazard.Fortune Magazine: \\"Assault On The House Of Lazard\\" by Robert Lenzner September 4, 2000 In 1900, his grandfather, David David-Weill, was named a partner. In 1927, his father Pierre David-Weill became a partner. Separated from his father, who was in New York City during World War II, David-Weill remained behind with his mother in occupied France, and, during the last year of Nazi occupation, at age 11, he hid with his mother and younger sister in the French village of B√©duer (Lot, southwestern France) where they were baptized and raised as Catholics (his father Pierre would later convert to Catholicism in 1965). After World War II was over, he went to live in New York City with his family. David-Weill was educated at the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de New York and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris.Academie de Beaux Artes: \\"Michel DAVID-WEILL retrieved October 3, 2015 Career In 1956, he joined Lazard Freres, and, in 1961, became a partner Under the stewardship of the chairman of Andr√© Meyer, Felix Rohatyn, who handled acquisitions, and he himself, who was the bookkeeper, Lazard grew rapidly. In 1975, his father died and he inherited his equity stake in Lazard, becoming the largest stakeholder in both Lazard New York and Lazard Paris, while also holding stakes in Lazard London. In 1977, when Meyer became sick and Rohatyn turned down an offer to replace him, David-Weill was named chairman. He continued to work closely with managing director, Felix Rohatyn, who was also made senior partner at Lazard in 1961. Also, by the power provided in clause 4.1 of the Lazard partnership agreement, he alone had the power to set compensations and the right to fire any partners at his discretion. Under David-Weill's direction, Lazard began to expand its business from traditional merger-and-acquisition advising to areas such as asset management and municipal bond. He also made numerous hires, including Steven Rattner. Lazard's profits also jumped from $5 million in the late 1970s to $500 million in the late 1990s. David-Weill also reunited the branches of Lazard by combining his stakes in New York and Paris and a buyout of Pearson for its stake in Lazard London for more than $600 million. After the retirement of Rohatyn, the firm's most prominent dealmaker, Lazard under David-Weill's leadership began to take a turn for the worse. Other dealmakers such as J. Ira Harris and Rattner also left the firm. To strengthen Lazard, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein as the CEO, who later decided to take Lazard public against the wishes of the family patriarch. David-Weill later stated that he regretted ever having hired Wasserstein.Lazard's David-Weill Wants Wasserstein To Quit if IPO Fails David-Weill is currently a director of Groupe Danone, one of the world's largest food-product companies.

He served as President of Uruguay from 1938 to 1943 and is most notable for leading Uruguay to support the Allies during World War II. Background Baldomir was born in Montevideo. He joined the army in 1900 and studied architecture and engineering. He designed many famous buildings in Uruguay, eventually directed the army corps of engineers and worked as a professor. By 1930, Baldomir was becoming involved in politics. He served as chief of police of Montevideo from 1931 to 1934 and as defense minister of Uruguay from 1935 to 1938, and was thus strongly identified with the rule of his brother-in-law, then President of Uruguay Gabriel Terra. President of Uruguay He was elected President of Uruguay in 1938 as a member of the long-ruling Colorado Party. He took office as President on June 19, 1938; the Vice President of Uruguay during his period of Presidential office was Alfredo Navarro. Baldomir set a high priority in involving Uruguay in international affairs, and appointed the famous diplomat Alberto Guani as foreign minister. =World War II= As World War II broke out (Baldomir was President during the Battle of the River Plate), Baldomir discouraged support for the Axis within the country, and early in 1942, he broke off diplomatic relations with the Axis Powers. In 1942, Baldomir, now a general in the army, expanded his powers through a military coup dissolving parliament and declaring an emergency. His term, which was soon to expire, was extended for a year. Soon a new Constitution came into force. In 1943, Baldomir voluntarily held elections and gave up power, but the continued dominance of the Colorados was ensured. Later life Baldomir retired from presidency on 1 March 1943. He was the president of Banco de la Rep√∫blica Oriental del Uruguay from 1943 to 1946. In 1948 he died of an illness in Montevideo. Legacy Baldomir's actions to identity Uruguay with the Allied cause in World War II have lessened his reputation as a controversial historical figure. It may be noted that he was a leading supporter of the previous President of Uruguay Gabriel Terra, who ruled by decree.

Geography Howe Sound's mouth at the Strait of Georgia is situated between West Vancouver and the Sunshine Coast. The sound is triangular, opening to the southwest into the Strait of Georgia, and extends northeast to its head at Squamish. There are several islands in the sound, three of which are large and mountainous in their own right. The steep-sided mainland shores funnel the breezes as the daily thermals build the wind to or more at the northern end of the sound on a typical summer day. A small outcrop of volcanic rock is located on the eastern shore of Howe Sound called the Watts Point volcanic centre. History The history of Howe Sound begins with the Indigenous people, the Squamish and Shishalh, who have roamed this land and traveled on this body of water for thousands of years, and whose village sites and camp sites are spread throughout the area. The land and islands are still used by Squamish and Shishalh for cultural practices. Both the Squamish and Shishalh are a part of the Coast Salish linguistic and cultural groupings. Spanish explorer Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez observed the sound in 1791 and named it Boca del Carmelo. Captain George Vancouver entered the sound in 1792, and named it after Admiral Earl Howe.\\"Howe Sound\\". Encyclopedia of British Columbia. Harbour Publishing, 2000. In 1888, copper was discovered in the mountains around Britannia Creek, south of Squamish. Large scale mining began at Britannia Beach in 1905, and by 1929, the largest copper mine in the British Empire was located here, beside the shores of Howe Sound. The mine closed in 1974, but part of its historical legacy has been the large amounts of toxic effluent it has deposited into Howe Sound.\\"Britannia Mines\\". Encyclopedia of British Columbia. Harbour Publishing, 2000. Islands Passage Island marks the entrance to Howe Sound. It has a few year-round residents and views of Downtown Vancouver and Vancouver Island. An unincorporated area, it is part of the Metro Vancouver Electoral Area A which is a member of the Metro Vancouver Regional District. Ships entering Howe Sound will pass east or west of Passage Island. Bowen Island is the most populous island and is nearest Vancouver, being just opposite Horseshoe Bay. It is incorporated as an island municipality and is a member municipality of Metro Vancouver. Gambier Island is the largest of the Howe Sound islands, to the northwest of Bowen, near the Langdale ferry landing. Gambier has a small resident population, plus hundreds more who enjoy the southwest peninsula community in the summer months. This area has a year-round foot ferry, Stormaway IV, run by BC Ferries, and a community centre. Until recently, the only commercial location on the island, the General Store, was located here, near New Brighton, where the ferry lands. The store is now closed. This area of Gambier has landline power and telephone. There also are numerous seasonal homes lining the shores of the southern bays (West Bay, Centre Bay, Port Graves, and Halkett Bay) along with several local yacht club outstations in both the southern and northern parts of the island. Beyond the southwest peninsula, seasonal visitors rely on solar, wind and generator power. The northwestern shore of Gambier, with adjacent Thornborough Channel, is still dominated by the forest industry. The \\"pond\\" at Andy's Bay is one of North America's largest logsorts. A resident-operated woodlot on provincial land (WL039) is located near Andy's Bay, with active logging and reforestation. The northeast quadrant of Gambier also is Crown land, with two more major woodlots proposed by the provincial Ministry of Forests, but not pursued as yet due to the opposition of many local residents, members of the Squamish Nation, whose territory this includes, and concerned supporters of a less-industrial Howe Sound. The island has excellent hiking in the provincial Crown land that dominates its north sector. A third, smaller but extremely steep and conical island to the northeast of both is Anvil Island, also known as Hat Island. Anvil Island has a summer church camp as well as a number of seasonal homes, primarily in the southern bay formed by a prominent eastward projecting peninsula. The north facing bay of this peninsula is exposed to strong overnight and winter outflow northerly winds. Keats Island, near Gibson's Landing, has numerous summer homes lining its shores, in addition to a large church camp for children, a large retreat resort and Plumper Cove Marine Provincial Park. The island is serviced by water taxi from Langdale. There is a small core of permanent residents living in Eastbourne. Between Keats and Bowen Islands lie the Pasley group, a cluster of privately owned islands, each with a scattering of seasonal homes. Further southeast lies Worlcombe Island, also seasonally inhabited. Just north of Horseshoe Bay lies Bowyer Island, another steep sided island with seasonal homes along its south and west shores. Like Passage Island, Bowyer Island is also an unincorporated area and part of the Metro Vancouver Electoral Area A which is a member of the Metro Vancouver Regional District. Uninhabited islands in the northern section of Howe Sound include the Defence Islands, a pair of rocky islands that comprise the Defence Islands Indian Reserves 28 and 28A. Christie Islet and Pam Rocks just south of Anvil Island are recognized bird breeding sites and a great place to view seals sunning themselves. Pam Rocks is a reporting weather station for the marine weather system. Winter northerly gales can reach close to hurricane force here, known as squamish. Between Gambier Island and the Port Mellon mill lies Woolridge Island, privately owned with a single residence. Transportation Highway 99 and Howe Sound as seen from Furry Creek British Columbia Highway 99 (the Sea-to-Sky Highway, also known as the Squamish Highway) runs along the east shore of Howe Sound, linking the Lower Mainland to Lions Bay, Britannia Beach, and Squamish, where it then proceeds inland to Whistler and beyond. From 2007 to 2010, this highway was upgraded to what would ultimately become a mixture of four-lane divided sections, three lane sections with alternating passing lanes, and some improved two lane sections. The first section of Olympics-related improvements, between Horseshoe Bay and Lions Bay, opened in December 2005.Sea to Sky Project overview - Ministry of Transportation Also following the east shore, and built before and below the highway, is the former British Columbia Railway (BCR) which was leased in 2004 by the provincial government to the Canadian National Railway. The Pacific Great Eastern Railway (which became the BCR) between Squamish and Lillooet was constructed 1912‚Äì16, and Squamish became a busy place as a rail-port for freight and also burgeoning passenger traffic as lodges up the rail line became popular with weekenders from the city, who reached the railway via the MV Britannia. Railway connections to North Vancouver were completed in the 1950s, with a highway built in the later 1960s that was the precursor to today's Sea-to-Sky Highway. BC Ferries runs regularly scheduled ferry service between Horseshoe Bay and Langdale and between Horseshoe Bay and Snug Cove on Bowen Island. They also run a foot- passenger-only ferry that serves New Brighton on Gambier Island and Keats Landing and Eastbourne settlements on Keats Island from the Langdale ferry terminal near Gibsons, an easy transfer from the ferry from Horseshoe Bay to Langdale. There is also private water taxi service from Horseshoe Bay and Langdale to Bowen Island, Gambier Island and Keats Island. Communities Port of Squamish as seen from Stawamus Chief Horseshoe Bay terminal in West Vancouver Squamish is a minor deepwater port. It was the original southern terminus of the BCR in the days when it was the Pacific Great Eastern, and had a busy ferry terminal where travellers would disembark from ferries and steamers bringing them in from Vancouver Harbour. In the 1960s what was then called the Squamish Highway was finally pushed through from Vancouver. This made the former steamer service unnecessary. Once a thriving forestry town, with recent cutbacks in logging along with the closure and dismantling of a major sawmill in 2004, Squamish has become a tourist destination and a commuter community for workers in nearby Whistler and Vancouver. The closure of the Woodfibre pulp mill in 2006 signalled an end to the resource-based economy here. Squamish is a world centre for rock climbing, with the bulk of the Stawamus Chief, a huge rock formation always busy with climbers, along with other formations overlooking downtown and the head of Howe Sound. In addition,the strong winds and flat waters at the upper end of Howe Sound have made Squamish a mecca for windsurfers, kite boarders and keelboat sailors. Just south of town along Highway 99 is Shannon Falls, a tourist attraction and provincial park, and Darrell Bay, which is the ferry dock for service to the former pulp mill at Woodfibre, across the sound. Woodfibre has no road access. From the early 1900s until 1973 there was a small company town surrounding the mill where most employees lived. By 1975 all employees had relocated, mostly to Squamish, and the town was dismantled. Over the next 30 years the mill slowly expanded into the former townsite, but it closed in early 2006. Porteau Cove is a provincial campsite and also a location for scuba diving, as artificial reefs have been sunk in the area. The bluffs above the highway in this area are one of the main avalanche hazards to both the highway and the rail line, which are squeezed together between the foot of the bluffs and the shoreline. Furry Creek is the location of a new upscale golf course and resort development. Proposals have called for a new highway from Vancouver via the Capilano River watershed would emerge on Highway 99 at Furry Creek.Notes from the Howe Sound Community Forum (p.7). November, 2000. However, the fact that this route traverses the Lower Mainland's Capilano watershed creates nearly insurmountable political obstacles to its construction. Lions Bay is a small residential community, incorporated as a village, climbing the mountainside from Howe Sound up to the west peak of the pair of summits known as The Lions, which overlook Vancouver on the other side. Near Squamish is Britannia Beach, the former gold and copper mining town and port with some highway-based eateries and stores. Its name does not come directly from associations with Britain, but from the MV Britannia, the old Vancouver-Squamish steamer (a new MV Britannia built in 1983 is in use as a tourboat based in Coal Harbour, Vancouver). Today the mine mill site is the Britannia Mine Museum, with mine shaft tours, gold panning etc. The prominent multi-story mine building underwent a restoration with the replacement of hundreds of window panes. The former mine site is also frequently used as a shooting site for a variety of TV and movie productions, including for the X-Files TV series. Horseshoe Bay is a residential and commercial district of West Vancouver on the southern edge of the Sea-to-Sky Highway. The highway clings to the cliffside above the BC Ferries terminal at Horseshoe Bay. Restaurants, tourist shops and galleries, a pub or two and recreational marinas are also situated in the community. Ferries from Horseshoe Bay go to Departure Bay in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, Bowen Island, and Langdale on the Sunshine Coast, which is the ferry terminal for the southern Sunshine Coast. The peninsula southwest of Horseshoe Bay terminates at Whytecliffe, an upscale residential area and public park, which is the southern point of Howe Sound's east shore. South of here is the entrance of English Bay and Burrard Inlet. Also in the vicinity of Howe Sound's mouth, at Point Atkinson is Lighthouse Park. Just north of Langdale is Port Mellon, another pulp and paper mill somewhat larger than Woodfibre. Port Mellon, which, unlike Woodfibre, produces paper and pulp (and is serviced by road from Gibsons/Langdale) is one of the oldest operating mills in B.C. Woodfibre's closure included measures securing the fibre supply for Port Mellon, making its future considerably more secure. At the southwest \\"corner\\" of Howe Sound, just a few kilometres south of the Langdale Ferry terminal is the town of Gibsons. Gibsons is perhaps best known as the locale for the former CBC Television series The Beachcombers. The restaurant featured in the series, Molly's Reach, remains open for business.Molly's Reach See also *The Barrier *Gulf Islands References Category:Fjords of British Columbia Category:Landforms of Vancouver Category:Sunshine Coast (British Columbia) Category:Sea-to-Sky Corridor Category:Sounds of British Columbia ","title":"Howe Sound"},{"id":"3001446","text":"Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong is a five-star hotel located on Connaught Road in Central, Hong Kong, owned and managed by Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.

He was a patron and friend of Froissart, in whose chronicles his exploits have a conspicuous and probably an exaggerated place. Ancestry and early life Born about 1310, Walter Manny was the fourth of five sons of Jean \\"le Borgne\\" de Masny and Jeanne de Jenlain. His father, who was Lord of Masny (situated some twelve miles west of Valenciennes), was slain in 1324 at La R√©ole near Bordeaux. In 1346 Walter recovered his father's body, and had it sent to Valenciennes for burial in the church of the Cordeliers. Jean le Borgne's epitaph refers to his son Walter as one . Manny entered the service William I, Count of Hainault, and was in attendance on the Count's brother, Jean de Beaumont; it has been conjectured that Manny and his four brothers all likely grew up in Beaumont's household. Both William and Jean were brothers of Alice of Hainault, for whose soul Manny requested prayers in his will. In December 1327, Manny came to England as a page in the household of Edward III's bride, Philippa of Hainault, Count William's daughter. Froissart describes him as the Queen's esquire carver, and Keeper of the Queen's Greyhounds. Military career Manny played a distinguished role in the Scottish wars of Edward III, being present at the Battle of Dupplin Moor and the Siege of Berwick. He captured the pirate John Crabbe, whose expertise in fighting at sea would become of great value to the king. In 1337 Manny was appointed Admiral of the Northern Seas, and in the following year accompanied King Edward to the continent, where in the campaigns of the next few years he proved himself one of the boldest and ablest of the English king's military commanders. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Sluys.Hendriks, Lawrence. The London Charterhouse, London, Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1889, p. 19 Manny figured prominently in the defense of Brest during the Breton War of Succession. When Hennebont was besieged during that War, councillors tried to persuade the Montforts, led by Joanna of Flanders, to surrender to Charles of Blois, nephew of Philip VI of France. When she looked out a window, she saw the ships commanded by Manny sailing towards them. With the help of Manny and his small force, she managed to withstand the siege. In 1346, after the Breton War of Succession, Manny was captured, despite having been offered safe conduct, and thrown into prison at Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly. He quickly broke out of prison and joined the Siege of Calais, where he negotiated with the governor, after Philip VI had abandoned the city. He asked for mercy for the Burghers of Calais, but Edward only granted this request when Queen Philippa added her pleas to his.Mortimer (2008), pp.252‚Äì253 Manny also took part in the expedition to defend the city once again in 1349, during that year's failed French siege of Calais. According to Froissart, King Edward III and his son fought incognito under Manny's banner. In 1347, he bought the parish of Tunstall, Kent. Manny also took part in the campaigns of the Earl of Derby in Guyenne, being present at the battles of Bergerac and Auberoche. He was summoned to parliament as a baron by writ from 12 November 1347 to 8 January 1371. In 1359, he was made a Knight of the Garter, succeeding John, Lord Grey (died 1 September 1359), and at various times he received extensive grants of land both in England and in France. He was frequently employed by King Edward in the conduct of diplomatic negotiations as well as in military commands. He was one of those charged with the safe custody of the French king John II when a prisoner at Calais in 1360; in 1369 he was second in command under John of Gaunt in his invasion of France.  Philanthropy  Manny is remembered for his share in the foundation of the Charterhouse in London. In 1349 he bought some acres of land near Smithfield, London, which were consecrated as a burying-place where large numbers of the victims of the Black Death were interred; and here he built a chapel, from which the place obtained the name of \\"Newchurchhaw.\\" The chapel and ground were bought from Manny by the Bishop of London, Michael Northburgh, who died in 1361 and by his will bequeathed a large sum of money to found there a Carthusian convent. It is not clear whether this direction was ever carried out; for in 1371 Manny obtained letters patent from King Edward III permitting him to found, apparently on the same site, a Carthusian monastery called \\"La Salutation Mere Dieu\\", where the monks were to pray for the soul of Northburgh as well as for the soul of Manny himself. The bishop's bequest may have contributed to the building and endowment of the house; or possibly, as seems to be implied by a bull granted by Urban VI, in 1378, there were originally two kindred establishments owing their foundation to Northburgh and Manny respectively. At all events Manny, who died early in 1372, left instructions in his will, dated St Andrew's Day (30 November) 1371, that he was to be buried in the church of the Carthusian monastery founded by himself. During archaeological investigations at Charterhouse in 1947, W. F. Grimes discovered a skeleton in a lead coffin before the high altar of the monastic chapel. It was identified beyond reasonable doubt as Manny's by the presence in the coffin of a lead bulla (seal) of Pope Clement VI: in 1351 Clement had granted Manny a licence to select his own deathbed confessor, a document that would have been issued with just such a bulla attached.  Family  At the beginning of 1354, Manny married Margaret, daughter and heiress of Thomas of Brotherton, a younger son of King Edward I, whose first husband had been John Segrave, 4th Baron Segrave. This lady, who outlived Manny by many years, was Countess of Norfolk and Earl Marshal in her own right, and in 1397 she was created Duchess of Norfolk. Manny's only son, Thomas Manny, died young. His daughter Anne, Baroness Manny in her own right, married John Hastings, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and on the death of her only son in 1389 without children, the barony of Manny became extinct.

Early life  Jeffery was born on 5 February 1845 at 3 Mill Pleasant in Stoke Damerel, Devon, England to Thomas Hellier and Elizabeth (Buckland) Jeffery.T B Jeffery's birth certificate At sixteen years of age he was working as a \\"mathematical instrument maker.\\"UK Census 1861, Public Record Office At eighteen years of age, he emigrated to the United States and became a resident of Chicago, where \\"he was connected with the business of manufacturing telescopes.\\" Later he was engaged in making models for the patent office and in 1879 started in the bicycle business, being one of the pioneers in that field. He, with R. Philip Gormully, organized the Gormully & Jeffery Manufacturing Company and began making the Rambler bicycle.  Bicycle Manufacturer  Jeffery was an inventor and bicycle manufacturer with his partner, R. Philip Gormully, who built and sold Rambler bicycles through his company, Gormully & Jeffery Mfg. Co., in Chicago from 1878 to 1900. The Rambler was still a proud piece of machinery when low prices took precedence over high quality. Its body featured flared metal tubing for extra strength at the joints, which were brazed by immersion in molten brass. These techniques continued even after Gormully & Jeffery (G&J;) and Rambler became names of the American Bicycle Company, or Bicycle Trust, which was not known for the best manufacturing techniques in all of its lines. By 1900, Gormully & Jeffery was the country's second-largest bicycle maker and Jeffery had gained fame for developing, among other things, the clincher rim that enabled pneumatic tires to be used.  Invention of the clincher rim  Dunlop's original pneumatic tires were wrapped onto the rim, making them hard to service. The challenge was securely fastening the tire to the rim, while also allowing it to be easily removed for service. This was an era where horseshoe nails and other sharp debris was common on roads and tires typically had to be repaired every 100 miles. From 1889 to 1895 a slew of patents were filed with various different methods of fastening tires to rims. Jeffery came up with an improved tire, held on the rim by hard rubber flanges that locked into channels in the rim. This came to be known as the \\"Clincher\\" tire. Jeffery received a patent on the ancestor of all clincher tires in 1892 (US Patent 466,789). And from 1900 to about 1913 clinchers (which are still used on some bicycles) were the most common form of tires used on U.S. automobiles. William Erskine Bartlett patented a similar clincher technology in Great Britain and the respective patents prevented British companies from manufacturing in the U.S. and vice versa. in 1903 G&J; formed The Clincher Tire Manufacturer's Association to license use of their patent to tire companies, and the snubbing by CTMA of newcomers Goodyear and Firestone led these companies to develop the \\"straight- side\\" tire, which is the basis of all modern automobile tires. The ancestor of the straight side tire was invented by Charles Kingston Welch in 1890. In 1906, CTMA lost a patent infringement suit over the G&J; patent, opening the U.S. market to other manufacturers of clincher tires. In 1917, CTMA changed its name to the Tire and Rim Association and that organization still publishes an annual Year Book containing tire and wheel standards.  Automobile manufacturer  Thomas B. Jeffery Thomas B. Jeffery and his 1897 Rambler prototype He was one of America's first men interested in automobiles, and in 1897, he built the first Rambler motor car. Jeffery was serious about motor cars so he sold his stake in G&J; and founded the Thomas B. Jeffery Company. He used the G&J; money to buy the old Sterling Bicycle Co. factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he set up shop to manufacture automobiles on a large scale. From 1902 until 1908, Jeffery moved steadily to bigger, more reliable models. His cars were built on assembly lines (the second manufacturer to adopt them -- Ransom Olds was first), and in 1903 he sold 1,350 Ramblers. By 1905, Jeffery more than doubled this number. One reason may have been because he went to the steering wheel before 1904. In 1907, he was building a large variety of different body styles and sizes. Among them was a five-passenger, $2,500 Rambler weighing 2,600 pounds and powered by a 40-hp engine. Jeffery died in 1910 while on holiday in Pompeii, in Italy, and after his death, Charles T. Jeffery changed the automotive branding from Rambler to Jeffery in the founder's honor. Ultimately, Jeffery's family sold the manufacturing business to Charles W. Nash, who renamed the company Nash Motors and greatly expanded manufacturing efforts.

Signs and symptoms The presenting features may be a palpable testicular mass or asymmetric testicular enlargement in some cases. The tumour may present as signs and symptoms relating to the presence of widespread metastases, without any palpable lump in the testis. The clinical features associated with metastasising embryonal carcinoma may include low back pain, dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, haematemesis and neurologic abnormalities. Males with pure embryonal carcinoma tend to have a normal amount of the protein alpha-fetoprotein in the fluid component of their blood. The finding of elevated amounts of alpha-fetoprotein is more suggestive of a mixed germ cell tumour, with the alpha-fetoprotein being released by the yolk sac tumour component. Diagnosis Embryonal carcinoma. H&E; stain. The gross examination usually shows a two to three centimetre pale grey, poorly defined tumour with associated haemorrhage and necrosis. The microscopic features include: indistinct cell borders, mitoses, a variable architecture (tubulopapillary, glandular, solid, embryoid bodies - ball of cells surrounded by empty space on three sides), nuclear overlap, and necrosis. Solid (55%), glandular (17%), and papillary (11%) are the most common primary patterns (predominant architectural pattern occupying at least 50%). Other less common primary patterns included nested (3%), micropapillary (2%), anastomosing glandular (1%), sieve-like glandular (<1%), pseudopapillary (<1%), and blastocyst-like (<1%). Testicular embryonal carcinoma occurs mostly (84%) as a component of a mixed germ cell tumor, but 16% are pure. Occasionally, embryonal carcinoma develops predominantly in the context of polyembryoma-like (6%) and diffuse embryoma-like (\\"necklace\\" pattern) (3%) proliferations. =Ovarian= In the ovary, embryonal carcinoma is quite rare, amounting to approximately three percent of ovarian germ cell tumours. The median age at diagnosis is 15 years. Symptoms and signs are varied, and may include sexual precocity and abnormal (increased, reduced or absent) uterine bleeding.Mills, S (ed.) 2009. Sternberg's Diagnostic Pathology. 5th Edition. There may be elevations in serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels but it would be in association with other tumors, (e.g. yolk sac tumor) because they themselves do not produce the serum markers.Robbins Review of Pathology By Edward C. Klatt and Vinay Kumar, 300 pp, with illus, Philadelphia, Pa, WB Saunders Co, 2000. At surgery, there is extension of the tumour beyond the ovary in forty percent of cases. They are generally large, unilateral tumours, with a median diameter of 17 centimetres. Long-term survival has improved following the advent of chemotherapy. The gross and histologic features of this tumour are similar to that seen in the testis. =Testicular = In the testis pure embryonal carcinoma is also uncommon, and accounts for approximately ten percent of testicular germ cell tumours. However, it is present as a component of almost ninety percent of mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumours. The average age at diagnosis is 31 years, and typically presents as a testicular lump which may be painful. One fifth to two thirds of patients with tumours composed predominantly of embryonal carcinoma have metastases at diagnosis. =Differential diagnosis= An important key to distinguish it from other tumors, such as seminoma (vacuolated), teratocarcinoma (3 differentiated germ layers), yolk sac tumor (Schiller-Duval bodies), and the Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (strings of glands), is that the embryonal carcinoma cells are \\"trying\\" to evolve into their next stage of development. So in the testicle, they are often observed as blue cells attempting to form primitive tubules. References  External links  * Embryonal Carcinoma Definition. MedicineNet.com. 10 March 2004.

Early life He was the son of Thomas B. Jeffery, founder of Thomas B. Jeffery Company, an automobile manufacturer. Career When his father died in 1910, Charles Jeffery assumed control of the Thomas B. Jeffery Company. Under his guidance, the firm continued to prosper. His most significant success was in the large number of heavy-duty trucks he manufactured. The U.S. Army was Jeffery's best customer during the years of World War I. The four-wheel, chain-drive Jeffery Quad eventually became the workhorse of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Jeffery also made impressive advances in sales of his automobile. He dropped the Rambler marque in 1914 in favor of \\"Jeffery\\" and produced 10,283 of them. =RMS Lusitania= Jeffery was totally committed to the company and its success before he became a passenger on the ill-fated passenger ship RMS Lusitania in 1915. It was sunk by a German submarine off the Irish coast, with a heavy loss of life. Jeffery survived, but he lost interest in the company, or as one author put it, \\"re-evaluated his priorities\\". The Jeffery Company was put up for sale, and Charles Nash purchased the Thomas B. Jeffery Company and Charles T. Jeffery's lakeside commercial property at 6221 Third Avenue, Kenosha. Collections and death During his lifetime Jeffery collected an extensive library of rare books, maps and autographs which was sold at auction following his death at Merion Station, Pennsylvania.

Scope The Inquiry was set up by the Government of Ireland to identify complaints and allegations made against clergy of the Diocese of Ferns prior to April 2002, and to report upon the response of Church and Civil Authorities.Ferns Report p. 246 The Inquiry did not concern itself with the truth or otherwise of the complaints and allegations made, but entirely with the response to those allegations.Ferns Report p. 247 The Inquiry recorded its revulsion at the extent, severity and duration of the child sexual abuse allegedly perpetrated on children by priests acting under the aegis of the Diocese of Ferns.Ferns Report p. 259 The investigation was established in the wake of the broadcast of a BBC Television documentary Suing the Pope, which highlighted the case of Fr Se√°n Fortune, one of the most notorious clerical sexual offenders. The film followed Colm O'Gorman as he investigated the story of how Fortune was allowed to abuse him and countless other teenage boys.Suing the Pope BBC News O'Gorman, through One in Four, the organisation he founded to support women and men who have experienced sexual violence, successfully campaigned for the Ferns Inquiry. The Ferns Report was presented to the Irish government on 25 October 2005 and released the following day. It identified more than 100 allegations of child sexual abuse made between 1962 and 2002 against twenty-one priests operating under the aegis of the Diocese of Ferns. Eleven of these individuals were alive in 2002. The nature of the response by the Church authorities in the Diocese of Ferns to allegations of child sexual abuse by priests operating under the aegis of the diocese had varied over the forty years to 2002. Findings Among the facts revealed were: *The failure of Bishop Donal Herlihy to exclude clearly unsuitable candidates from the priesthood and his failure to ensure that alleged abusers were kept away from children; *His failure to report incidents of alleged sexual abuse to the legal authorities *The failure of his successor, Brendan Comiskey, to report incidents of abuse and his failure to establish sound child protection measures;Ferns Report p. 248 From 1990 onward he reported all allegations made by children to the authorities.Ferns Report p. 258 *The adoption of strict policies of immediate removal of any clergy subject to allegations by his successor, Bishop Eamon Walsh. *Police failure to properly investigate sexual abuse complaints prior to 1990.Ferns Report p. 249 Among the allegations made were: *The sexual touching of teenage girls near the altar of a church by one priest;Ferns Report p. 82 *The use of blackmail by another priest to force children to perform sex acts on him; *Most allegations did not involve rape, but a range of sexual assaults from inappropriate touching to masturbation.Ferns Report, Chapter 4, pp. 70‚Äì123 Multiple allegations of abuse were made against the following priests (those still alive have not been identified in the Ferns Report): *Fr Donal Collins, transferred from St Peter's College in Wexford to London in 1966 but returned to the College in 1968 *Fr James Doyle, ordination postponed in 1973, after a first allegation of drunken assault, but Doyle was ordained one year later.Ferns Report p. 76 These three are deceased: *Fr James Grennan, sexually molested girls in Monageer church, County Wexford while he heard confession *Canon Martin Clancy, molested his female victim in her own home *Fr Se√°n Fortune ministered in the village of Poulfour in Co. Wexford, in Belfast and in Dundalk. Allegations of abuse were made against him in all three places.Ferns Report =Bishop Comiskey= The Inquiry contacted the mother of a young woman who said that Bishop √âamonn Walsh who, as Apostolic Administrator, assumed control of the Ferns Diocese (following Comiskey's resignation) became aware of an allegation early in 2004. He called to see her daughter and urged her to make a formal statement, which she did. Walsh reported the matter to the Metropolitan for the Diocese of Ferns, Desmond Connell, Cardinal Archbishop of Dublin. A report on the matter was prepared for the Vatican. Comiskey was not interviewed during the preparation of this report. The report concluded that a delict had not been committed as regards the behaviour alleged but the fact that, under the influence of alcohol, Comiskey was alleged to have acted in such a manner was something that needed to be addressed to ensure that no repetition of such behaviour could take place. The Inquiry was informed by Comiskey that, although he agreed to step aside from active ministry when this allegation was first made known to church authorities, he had returned to ministry but agreed to refrain from high- profile acts of ministry. , he is residing in Inniskeen, County Monaghan. =Miche√°l Ledwith= Comiskey nominated his diocesan colleague, Monsignor Miche√°l Ledwith to be president of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth in 1984 despite the prior concerns of six seminarians about Ledwith's alleged homosexual orientation. Later allegations of sexual abuse of a minor became known after Ledwith resigned as president in 1994; he was defrocked by the Church 11 years afterwards. =Jim Grennan= This was also seen in other cases, such as that of Jim Grennan, a parish priest, who abused children as they prepared for First Communion, and Sean Fortune, who committed suicide before his trial for the rape of children. Judgement and recommendation Between 1960 and 1980, the Report found that Bishop Herlihy treated child sexual abuse by priests of his diocese exclusively as a moral problem. He transferred priests against whom allegations had been made, to a different post or a different diocese for a period of time but then returned them to their former position. By 1980, Bishop Herlihy recognised that there was a psychological or medical dimension to the issue of child sexual abuse. Some priests in respect of whom allegations had been made were sent to a psychologist. However, decisions were made by Bishop Herlihy to appoint to curacies priests against whom allegations had been made, in respect of whom a respected clerical psychologist had expressed his concerns in unambiguous terms as to their suitability to interact with young people. The report was also highly critical of the failure of the Garda S√≠och√°na (police) to properly investigate reported incidents. It noted with concern the disappearance of one police file detailing serious incidents of clerical sex abuse. It stated that the local health authorities failed to protect children even when aware of allegations. As a result of a late application, a further inspection of files from July 2005 revealed a further five cases of concern, which were mentioned in the report's appendix.http://www.bishop- accountability.org/reports/2005_10_Ferns/ferns_9_0_appendix.pdf This raised concern about the diocese's willingness to disclose relevant files. Process and Publication of the Report An initial report was made to the government in 2002 by George Bermingham SC. A non-statutory private inquiry was then established in March 2003 by Miche√°l Martin as Minister for Health and Children, comprising three persons: Francis Murphy, a retired Supreme Court Judge; Dr Helen Buckley, a sociology lecturer at Trinity College Dublin; and Dr Laraine Joyce of the office of health management, a part of the Ministry for Health and Children.http://www.bishop- accountability.org/reports/2005_10_Ferns/ferns_0_0_title_exec_intro.pdf The report was published in October 2005, noting the anonymity of victims and alleged abusers, and highlighting that in the Ministry's opinion: no evidence was placed before the Inquiry suggesting the operation or the organisation of a paedophile ring in the Diocese of Ferns or any clerical institution within that Diocese. The report cost just under ‚Ç¨1.9 million. The Report was considered to be more robust that the Church's own McCullough Report, released earlier in 2005, which covered one aspect concerning allegations about Michael Ledwith. The main D√°il debate on the Ferns Report was in two parts on 9 November 2005. The Irish Senate debate started on 10 November.

Biography Touschek was born and attended school in Vienna. In 1937, he was not allowed to finish high school since his mother was Jewish. He passed the final year exam in a different school as an external pupil. Shortly after he started studying physics and mathematics at the University in Vienna, he again had to quit for racial reasons. Thanks to a couple of friends, he could keep on studying in Hamburg, where nobody knew of his origins. In order to make a living, he took up several jobs at the same time. During this period, he worked at the Studiengesellschaft f√ºr Elektronenger√§te, a company affiliated to Philips, where \\"drift tubes\\" - the forerunners of the klystron - were being developed at that time. In 1943, he asked Rolf Wider√∏e to cooperate with him in building a betatron, critically studying an article of Donald Kerst. In the following, Touschek, Wider√∏e, R. Kollath and G. Schumann worked on a 15 MeV betatron, which was constructed near Hamburg and was operational in 1944. When Touschek was arrested by the Gestapo in 1945, Wider√∏e visited him in prison, and during these meetings they continued to talk about the betatron. In particular, Touschek conceived the idea of radiation damping for electrons circulating in a betatron. Largely by chance, Touschek escaped the Kiel concentration camp to which he would have been deported. During the death march from the Hamburg prison, Touschek was shot by an SS officer, presumed being dead, and thus left behind. After the war, he graduated from the University of G√∂ttingen in 1946, where he came into contact with Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, and finished his diploma thesis. A short time later, he was appointed at Max Planck Institute as a research worker. In 1947, he left for Glasgow on a fellowship. He was subsequently appointed an Official lecturer in Natural Philosophy at the University of Glasgow, a position he kept until he left for Rome in 1952. He decided to stay in Rome permanently, receiving the position of researcher at the National laboratories of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare in Frascati, near Rome. He was also appointed as a part-time lecturer at the University of Rome- La Sapienza, where he eventually became a full professor in 1978. He did, however, return to Glasgow briefly in 1955 where he married artist Elspeth Yonge (born 1931), the daughter of the eminent Scottish zoologist Charles Maurice Yonge. A son, Francis, was born in 1958 and brother Steven followed in 1961. On 7 March 1960, Touschek gave a talk in Frascati where he proposed the idea of a collider: a particle accelerator where a particle and its antiparticle circulate the same orbit in opposite direction. When bunches of opposite-moving particles and antiparticles collide, they annihilate and produce new particles depending on the collision energy. This concept is at the base of all present-day very high energy particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The first electron-positron storage ring, called Anello Di Accumulazione (ADA), was constructed in Frascati under Touschek's supervision in the early sixties. During the next decade more electron-positron rings followed and their outcomes changed completely some of the physics community perceptions of the world. One of the transitions, the elementary hadrons by then turned to be composite particles after. Even though ADA has been turned off long time ago, the laboratory is active and contributes work in the field of electron linear accelerators. Significant collaborations are the LIL for LEP in 1986 and CLIC test facility at CERN. Touschek died in Innsbruck in 1978.

It began at the eastern end of the intersection between modern day SR 997 and SR 9336 and ended at Biscayne National Park. The westernmost two blocks of SR 906 are now the easternmost two blocks of SR 9336. Route description State Road 906 begun at the intersection of current day SR 997 and SR 9336 as West Palm Drive. After heading for two blocks east, it would intersect with US 1 just south of the Turnpike's southern terminus, heading east, becoming East Palm Drive. An overhead sign on US 1 used to display directions to both Biscayne National Park and Everglades National Park, which is to the west via what is now SR 9336. On East Palm Drive, it would pass by Prime Outlets shopping mall, the Homestead Sports Complex, and the Homestead-Miami Speedway. The road continues east through Homestead, ending at the Biscayne National Park visitors center. History The designation of SR 906 was established in 1945 and lasted until the mid-1980s, when the westernmost two blocks of SR 906 were merged with the east-west segment of the former SR 27 to form SR 9336, which was in turn shortened to its current configuration a decade later.

In his review for Allmusic, Andy Kellman from wrote that the album sounded \\"very uneven and hastily thrown together.\\" He criticized A Faithful Christmas for switching between \\"thoroughly modern\\" and classic Christmas songs, calling Evans's original material on the album \\"spirited but bland.\\" He however praised her \\"straightforward version\\" of \\"The Day That Love Began.\\" Chris Willman from Entertainment Weekly found that \\"some of her beat-heavy originals are Faith-based fun [but] misses include an old James Brown Xmas tune with way more 'Good Gods!' than any non-Godfather should attempt.\\" People magazine writer Chuck Arnold felt that \\"the girliness of \\"Santa Baby\\" and playfulness of \\"Mistletoe and Holly\\" don't suit [Evans].

He was known also for verse (he was a war poet of World War I), including a number of verse novels, and short stories. He was born in London into a Jewish family but was baptised as an Anglican at the age of 13. After education at Eton College, he went into the family cigar business and became Managing Director on his twenty-first birthday, his father, Arthur Frankau, having died in November 1904.Gilbert Frankau, Self-Portrait, Hutchinson 1940, Ch. 18 p99 A few months before his death, at sixty-eight, from lung cancer, he converted to Roman Catholicism. Career Frankau served in the British Army from the outbreak of war in 1914. He was first commissioned in the 9th Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment on 6 October 1914,http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/28969/pages/9136 then transferred into the Royal Field Artillery in March 1915. He went to the Western Front as a brigade adjutant and fought in major battles of the British Expeditionary Force ‚Äì Loos, Ypres and the Somme in France and Belgium ‚Äì and wrote for the Wipers Times. He was later promoted a staff captain in October 1916 for special duty in Italy. He was invalided out on 22 February 1918.http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/30535/supplements/2286 His later used his wartime experiences in novels. The family business did not survive the war; Frankau became a writer. His novels, while having conventional romantic content, also contained material from his own conservative politics and meditations on Jewish identity in the climate of the times. Some of them were filmed (see Christopher Strong; If I Marry Again was based on a short story). His status as a divorc√© (he married three times) frustrated his political ambitions the Conservative Party of the time did not regard divorce as acceptable. His outspoken criticism of Stanley Baldwin also did not endear him to the Tory leadership.Gilbert Frankau, Self-Portrait, Hutchinson 1940, Ch. 43 pp. 270‚Äì271 Recalling the 1920s, Gilbert Frankau wrote: \\"Political journalism meant more to me than my novels and short stories. Only fiction, however, could make me enough money to gratify my supreme ambition a seat in the House.\\"Gilbert Frankau, Self-Portrait, Hutchinson 1940, Ch. 43 p265 In 1928, he was invited by the then proprietor of \\"The Great Eight\\" a group of weeklies including Tatler, The Graphic and The Illustrated London News to launch a new Right-wing weekly newspaper, Britannia.Gilbert Frankau, Self- Portrait, Hutchinson 1940, Ch. 54 pp. 331‚Äì334 Frankau threw himself into this venture with characteristic energy, but it was not a success.Gilbert Frankau, Self-Portrait, Hutchinson 1940, Chh. 54‚Äì60 refer passim, in some detail After he had been unceremoniously removed from his post, Time gleefully reported:Time, Vol. XII, No. 26, Monday 24 December 1928: Agin, Agin, Agin \\"Twirling his glass of sherry, Gilbert 'Swankau' Frankau alibied: \\"'As the founder of Britannia [sip], I said what I thought, without fear or favour. Evidently, I am against lots of people [sip], for I believe in everything British! That was what Britannia stood for while I held her helm.' \\"Actually the Frankau weekly Britannia stood not for but against everything British or foreign which did not come within the extreme Fascist fringe of the little Semite's whims. He was 'agin' the Government of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, 'agin' the David Lloyd George Liberals, 'agin' the Ramsay MacDonald Laborites...\\" In the aftermath of this disappointment, Gilbert Frankau according to his own account approached a Conservative politician he \\"knew to be rather close to Stanley Baldwin\\", offering to stand for Parliament at his own expense in the forthcoming General Election, but was advised: \\"'I'd better be frank with you. As a divorced man, you could never be adopted by the Conservative party. If you're so keen on a political career, I should try the Labour people. They're not so particular.'\\"Gilbert Frankau, Self-Portrait, Hutchinson 1940, Ch. 59 p367 Frankau remained a staunch Right-winger, however. In 1933, his notorious Daily Express article \\"As a Jew I am Not Against Hitler\\"Daily Express, Tuesday 9 May 1933 was published shortly after Adolf Hitler had come to power in Germany; he later retracted his position. In fact, this particular piece was more balanced than the headline now appears: \\"Time alone will tell whether the little Austrian with the Charlie Chaplin moustache is a mere spellbinder or a statesman\\", comments Frankau, ending with the poignant question, \\"who are we, the great expounders of democracy, and how are we, already disarmed to the point of national danger, to interfere?\\" His autobiography, completed in August 1939,Gilbert Frankau, Self-Portrait, Hutchinson 1940, Epilogue p415 includes emphatically anti-German comments, such as: \\"The Pomper of Potsdam looked all of a warlord, even if he did bolt to Doorn like a rabbit. The Neurasthenic of Nuremberg and his gangster stooges look ‚Äì the hooligans they are.\\"Gilbert Frankau, Self-Portrait, Hutchinson 1940, Ch. 10 p58 On the eve of World War II, Frankau was commissioned into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in August 1939. He was promoted Squadron Leader in April 1940 but invalided from the service in February 1941. He was awarded permanent disability retired pay in 1944, in the meantime having served in the 14th (Home Guard) Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment from 1942. Few of his literary works have survived in reputation. Family His mother, Julia Frankau (1859‚Äì1916), sister of Mrs Aria and Owen Hall, wrote under the name Frank Danby (and is said to have collaborated with George Moore). His mother was an associate of Oscar Wilde. His youngest daughter, Pamela Frankau, from his first marriage was also a successful writer. His eldest daughter Ursula D'Arch Smith (Nee Frankau) wrote under the name Mary Nicholson. Her son Timothy d'Arch Smith, writer and bibliographer, is a grandson.

It is preserved in Shint≈ç Mus≈ç-ry≈´ as a \\"heiden\\" (subsumed teaching). History The methods that were originally taught in this ryuha included b≈çjutsu, hobaku (a.k.a. hojojutsu or torinawa), torite, kusarigama and shuriken. Some scholars date the origin to Harayuki Uemon Ujisada who compiled the techniques. Yet, his lineage harkens back to a priest who lived in the early 15th century, named Nen Ami Jion, as the ryuso (founder). In any case the ryuha eventually fragmented as the b≈çjutsu tradition was discovered to be practiced in Kyoto; the torite is recorded in Numata-han and Yoshida-han and still another branch was recorded as practicing the b≈çjutsu (as well as naginata) in Yonezawa-han. The Kusarigama is perhaps the best known fragment of the ryuha. The kusarigama The original inspiration for the kusarigama is the ordinary scythe (kama) which was used by peasants to harvest crops and by infantrymen to clear out vegetation when on campaign. The Isshin-ryu tradition dictates that the claimed founder of Isshin-ryu, Nen Ami Jion, created the IR-kusarigama after receiving a vision of a divine being holding a scythe(kama) in one hand and a metal weight in the other. Among the various kusarigama-designs of other traditions the kusarigama found in Isshin-ryu is of a rather uncommon design. IS-kusarigama traits are the longer chain and straight, double-edged blade, with several other traditions preferring a curved single-edged blade and a much shorter chain. Early documents describing the weapon state that the blade is around 30 cm, with a chain length of 3.6 meters. The \\"kama\\" or blade is straight for the most part, and has a double edge with an attached metal handguard. The handle is made of hardwood and is approximately 36 cm in length. Kusarigama methods The kusarigama's role as a battlefield weapon was limited, as it required an open area in which to swing the chain and weight. The ability to use the chain effectively was slim on a crowded battlefield and even tall grass and tree-branches could prevent the chain from being swung properly. The kusarigama found its main usage in peace-time for law-enforcement or duels in less hindering environments. As a practical weapon, the scythe-part of the IR-kusarigama is used to strike, slash or thrust at various parts of an opponent's body, including neck, hands, wrists and solar plexus. The scythe is also used to catch an opponent's sword between the blade and the handguard. A strength of the IR-kusarigama is that it can be wielded in the normal manner, with the scythe up, or it can be used upside down. The handle itself, being made of hardwood, is used to strike, thrust, block and parry. The chain can be swung as a flail and used to ensnare the opponent's sword, limbs or even the body itself making it difficult for the swordsman to maneuver or using his weapon effectively. In some forms (kata) the weight is deployed to strike the opponent's body, including the head, back and hands. Training The kusarigama is for the most part taught only to advanced students who have achieved a high level of proficiency in the Shinto Muso-ryu Jodo forms, though the level required is not standardized and different Jodo-organizations have different requirements. Modern Isshin-ryu exponents use a wooden version of the kusarigama for safety-reasons. The handguard (goken) is still made of metal but the chain and weight replaced by rope and a leather bag. A kusarigama with a metal (though non-sharp) blade is sometimes used for demonstrations. Isshin-ryu kusarigama forms In the Isshin-ryu system of modern times there a total of 30 training-forms (kata) divided into three series, Omote, Ura and Okuden. The forms of the Omote and Ura-series share the same name but are different in application.

FNC and FIFM In 2004 Daniel Langlois, director of FNC since 1999, left the organization to begin the Festival International de Films de Montr√©al (known in English as New Montreal FilmFest), which was initiated and created with the support of SODEC (Soci√©t√© de d√©veloppement des entreprises culturelles) and Telefilm Canada after a dispute between these Canadian government sponsors and the Montreal World Film Festival. Langlois initially programmed the Festival International de Films de Montr√©al (FIFM; New Montreal FilmFest) to coincide with the Montreal Festival of New Cinema and New Media (FCMM). According to press reports pertaining to the controversy between the Montreal World Film Festival (WFF/FFM) and the New Montreal FilmFest, Langlois planned to merge the two festivals, but failed to do so when the FCMM refused any such merger. The dates for the inaugural New Montreal FilmFest were ultimately changed to avoid conflicting with the dates of the FCMM. In 2005, both the FNC and the New Montreal FilmFest came under new management. In early 2006, the New Montreal FilmFest folded after the failure of its inaugural festival. Both the FNC and the Montreal World Film Festival would continue to exist after the demise of the New Montreal FilmFest.

While many of their songs poke fun at common Turkish types (\\"Ali Desidero\\", \\"Piskopatƒ±m\\") or satirise prejudice and corruption (\\"Deli Deli\\", \\"R√º≈üvet\\"), others are more spiritual in nature, showing their interest in Sufism (\\"Sufi\\", \\"Ate≈ü-i A≈üka\\"). In 1965, Mazhar Alanson and Fuat G√ºner first met at a record shop when Alanson saw G√ºner with a Beatles record in his hand and offered then a stranger G√ºner to listen the record together.

It is said to be hidden in the town of ≈†tƒõchovice in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. The story says that Emil Klein, a Nazi general, buried war booty in tunnels in Hradi≈°tko near ≈†tƒõchovice. The booty included gold, diamonds, jewelry and pieces of art as well as secret files and scientific documents from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Based on documents found in 1993 in the Weimar area, some experts believe that the Nazis hid the stolen goods and the missing Russian \\"Amber Room\\" in these tunnels. Only one person, former German (Sudeten German) Helmut Gaensel, claims that he possesses the original documents about the contents and has exact knowledge of the location where this alleged treasure is hidden. He says that he received these documents, additional information and a specific area map from Emil Klein, the former SS general in command. Mr. Gaensel worked for the Czech and other secret services and was involved in matters connected with this treasure. In 1964, he arranged the release of Klein from the KZ Valdice prison in Czechoslovakia. During the 1970s, and as late as 1989, there were some attempts to recover the ≈†tƒõchovice treasure under the control of the Ministries of Interior and Defence. The last efforts were carried out before the revolution by the foreign trade company Omnipol, which traded mainly in weapons. In 1992, Gaensel bought the relevant property and signed an exclusive agreement with the Czech authorities to obtain the sole rights to unveil the treasure.

They may be played by male or female actors. In the early years of Peking opera, all roles were played by men, but this practice is no longer common in any Chinese opera genre. Male dan actors Male actors who specialize in playing dan are referred to as n√°nd√†n (Áî∑Êó¶); the practice arose during the Qing dynasty due to imperial prohibitions against women performing on stage, considered detrimental to public morality. In the early years of Peking opera, all roles were played by men. Wei Changsheng, a male performer in the Qing court, developed the , or \\"false foot\\" technique, to simulate the bound feet of women and the characteristic gait that resulted from the practice. In Peking opera, the famous Dans are Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, and Xun Huisheng, all men. In Pingju, the \\"Four Big Famous Dans\\" S√¨ D√†m√≠ng D√†n) are Ai Lianjun, Bai Yushuang, Liu Cuixia, and Xi Cailian. There were also \\"Four Small Famous Dans\\" (ÂõõÂ∞èÂêçÊó¶) Li Shifang, Mao Shilai, Zhang Junqiu, and Song Dezhu. Subtypes There are a few different kinds of dan in Chinese opera. The commonly seen ones are 'Guimen Dan', 'Hua Dan', 'Daoma Dan', 'Wu Dan', 'Lao Dan' and 'Cai Dan'. Each different kind of dan has its own unique characteristics. =Guimen Dan= The Guimen Dan (, \\"boudoir-door role\\") is the role of the virtuous lady. It is also known as Qingyi (, \\"verdant-clad\\") or Zhengdan (, \\"straight role\\"). Guimen Dan are normally mature and sometimes married women. They may be rich or poor, young or of middle age, but they have to be mature women to fall under this category. Guimen Dan focus more on singing and they have little movement. They sing in a very high pitched and piercing voice. Opera schools in China have difficulty recruiting students for this kind of role, since it requires a good voice, good looks, and a good height. The most famous Guimen Dan of the last century was Mei Lanfang. Examples of Guimen roles are Du Liniang (Êùú‰∏ΩÂ®ò) from The Peony Pavilion (Áâ°‰∏π‰∫≠) and Wang Baochuan (ÁéãÂÆùÈíèÔºâfrom Wujiapo (Ê≠¶ÂÆ∂Âù°). =Hua Dan= A Hua Dan (, \\"flowery role\\") is a lively, vivacious young female character. They normally wear short blouses with pants or skirts. Unlike the Guimen Dan, the Hua Dan focuses more on movements and speech. They must be able to speak quickly and clearly. They also need to project an image of cuteness and innocence as Hua Dan always represent girls of around 12‚Äì16 years old. Often, a Guimen Dan is accompanied by a Hua Dan maid. Hongniang of the Romance of the Western Chamber and Yan Xijiao (ÈòéÊÉúÂß£) of Wulongyuan (‰πåÈæôÈô¢) have involved the role of Hua Dan. =Daoma Dan= A Daoma Dan (, \\"sword-and-horse role\\") is a young female warrior. The style of performance usually involves horseriding with a spear. This category is superficially similar to Wu Dan, but there is a difference. Daoma Dan does not fight as much as Wu Dan. They do more stunts and dancing with the spear or whatever weapons they have. Daoma Dan needs to sing, which is performed while dancing or doing stunts and requires great stamina. Daoma Dan usually wears female warrior costumes with the flags behind. Examples of Daoma Dan are Liang Hongyu and Mu Guiying. Daoma Dan is also the original Chinese title of the 1986 Hong Kong film Peking Opera Blues, directed by Tsui Hark. =Wu Dan= The Wu Dan (, \\"martial role\\") specializes in fighting with all kinds of weapons. The Wu Dan engages in fighting with opponents besides just doing stunts. In the past, the Wu Dan needed to perform cai qiao (Ë∏©Ë∑∑), which the Daoma Dan did not do. Cai qiao is a very difficult skill requiring the actress to stand on tip toe throughout the whole show. The actress will wear something akin to high heels shoes, but the heels of this special kind of shoe are so high that the actress is practically standing on tip toe. Fake small shoes are then attached underneath so that it appears that the actress has very small feet. It is an imitation of the foot binding practice. Wu Dan must master many acrobatic movements. They specialize only in fighting hence they seldom sing or speak. Examples of Wu Dan are Zhizhu Jing (ËúòËõõÁ≤æ) of Pansidong (Áõò‰∏ùÊ¥û) and Hu Sanniang. =Lao Dan= The Lao Dan (, \\"old role\\") are older women. They have their own set of movements and gestures and singing styles, distinguished against the Guimen Dan. The Guimen roles sing in high pitched and piercing voices while the Lao Dan sing in a lower pitched voice. Lao Dan costumes are also less vibrant compared to other female roles and they have much simpler hair styles. An example is Dowager She of Yang Men Nu Jiang (Êù®Èó®Â•≥Â∞Ü). =Cai Dan= The Cai Dan (, \\"colorful role\\") is a clownish woman. Cai Dan do not act like normal Dan and they do clownish gestures. Their movements resemble normal daily movements and they speak in normal voices. Clownish dans are now normally performed by men; hence they are physically unattractive, which is exaggerated by their hideous make up. =Huashan= One of Mei Lanfang's most important contributions to Peking opera was in pioneering another type of role, the . This role type combines the status of the with the sensuality of the .

Biography Wogan was the son of Sir John Wogan, who was MP for Pembrokeshire and High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire. In 1646 Thomas Wogan was elected MP for Cardigan Boroughs. During the Second Civil War, he fought on the side of Parliament at the Battle of St Fagans in 1648. After this battle, he was awarded some of his arrears of pay, promoted to Colonel and appointed governor of Aberystwyth Castle. An enthusiastic supporter of the army, he was appointed a commissioner of the High Court of Justice at the trial of King Charles. He attended every day and in January 1649, was 52nd of the 59 signatories on the death warrant of the King. During the interregnum he received the residue of his back pay as a grant of lands in Ireland, but was not an active member of the Rump and as a Commonwealth-man may have opposed the Protectorate. After the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Wogan was on 6 June 1660 excepted from the Act of Oblivion (i.e. exempted from the general pardon for King Charles's enemies). He surrendered on 27 June, and, although not within the prescribed period for doing so, his surrender was accepted, and he was one of the nineteen included in the saving clause of suspension from execution in case of attainder until the passing of a future act. His forfeited lands at Wiston, near Haverfordwest, were granted to Robert Werden in August 1662 (even thought there is evidence that these estates belong to Wogan's brother). On 27 July 1664 he was stated to have escaped from Cliffords Tower (York Castle), and a proclamation was issued for his arrest. He went to the Netherlands were along with Edmund Ludlow and Algernon Sidney, against the English government. It was rumoured that he travelled to England to ferment a rebellion, but there is no evidence of this and he was subsequently seen in Rotterdam. The last reference that has been discovered of him is dated September 1666, when Aphra Behn stated he was \\"at Utrecht, plotting\\". cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1666‚Äì7, p. 156. Family There is no evidence that Wogan was married, and the legend of his return and death in Wales may be apocryphal. However, in 1669 a woman was jailed \\"for attempting to raise money for him in his home county of Pembrokeshire\\".

Completed in 1906, it is best known for carrying out a successful attack on the Ottoman battleship in the Dardanelles, an action for which her captain received the Victoria Cross. It spent the remainder of its active life serving in the Mediterranean, being converted into a surface patrol boat late in the war. B11 was sold for scrap in 1919. Design and description The B class was an enlarged and improved version of the preceding A class. The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The B-class submarines had a crew of two officers and thirteen ratings. For surface running, the boats were powered by a single 16-cylinder Vickers petrol engine that drove one propeller shaft. When submerged the propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the B class had a range of at . The boats were armed with two 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in the bow. They could carry a pair of reload torpedoes, but generally did not as they would have to remove an equal weight of fuel in compensation. Pre-war career The submarine was constructed by Vickers in Barrow and was launched on 24 February 1906. Fitting out was completed 11 July the same year. Along with and the submarine was deployed to Malta in 1912. World War I service =Patrolling off the Dardanelles= In September 1914 the submarine was redeployed to Tenedos join the fleet watching the entrance of the Dardanelles. Later in 1914 while on patrol off the Dardanelles, B11 chased a torpedo boat for 4 miles up the strait. In April 1915 after ran aground off Kephez point, B11 was one of a number of boats that failed in their attempts to destroy the wreck. On 20 May the boat sighted while on patrol off the Gulf of Smyrna. The submarine attempted to attack but was spotted and UB-8 then dived before escaping. Attack on the Mesudiye Overview of the Dardanelle raid leading to the sinking of the Mes√ªdiye On 13 December 1914, B11, commanded by Lieutenant Norman Douglas Holbrook, entered the Dardanelles and torpedoed the Ottoman battleship . The submarine had been selected for the mission over and due to having been fitted with a new battery. The French boats at the submarine base had been rejected as it was agreed that they were less suitable than the British submarines. Guards were constructed over the various projections on the submarine's hull to reduce the risk of snagging on mines. B11 started its journey from Tenedos. Before the submarine reached the first row of mines it was discovered that one of the guards had become damaged making it worse than useless. The guard was removed and the attack continued. The boat then had to pass under five rows of mines through then uncharted currents. Passing through the minefield took about five hours. After B11 hit Mes√ªdiye it took eight hours for the submarine to escape initially with any attempt to use the periscope resulting in heavy fire. A scale model of B11 in Holbrook, NSW Lt. Holbrook was awarded the Victoria Cross, the first for service in a submarine, his First Lieutenant, Sydney Winn, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and every member of the crew was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. On 24 July 1916 the Prize court decided that the submarine's company was entitled to prize money for the sinking of Mes√ªdiye, and an award of ¬£3,500 was made, of which Holbrook received ¬£601 10s 2d, Win ¬£481 4s 2d, chief petty officers ¬£240 12s 1d, and seamen ¬£120 6s 1d. This represented three years' pay for a seaman. On 24 August 1915 the town of Germanton in New South Wales, Australia, was renamed \\"Holbrook\\" in his honour and a replica of B11 can be seen there. =Move to Venice= HMS B11 under way with decks awash The submarine was relocated from Malta to Venice in October 1915 arriving on the 28th. On 11 December of the same year the submarine under the command of Lieutenant Samuel Gravener was engaged by an Austrian flying boat. The attack was unsuccessful and the plane suffered engine failure forcing it to land. Gravener attempted attack the plane with a Maxim gun but it jammed and the plane was able to take off again before the submarine could ram it. On 17 January 1916 the submarine managed to capture the crew of an Austrian flying boat after the aircraft had suffered engine failure while returning from a bombing raid. On 17 March she was narrowly missed by a torpedo but was unable to locate the attacker. Later in the war B11 was converted to a surface patrol boat by raising the deck level and removing the electric motor. In addition the conning tower was replaced by a wheelhouse. B11 was sold for scrap in 1919 in Italy.

It deals with issues of slavery, what we know versus what we believe to be true, the difference between children and adults, street people (children), and spirituality, to an extent. A sequel, Terra-Farma, was also published. It continues the story of Joella and her siblings after they leave Galax-Arena, and follows their further brushes with Project Genesis Five, the organization who created the Galax-Arena. There was going to be a third novel called Universercus that would conclude the trilogy, but it was never published. Synopsis After their mother leaves and their father loses his mind, Joella, Peter, and Liane are traveling to their Aunt Jill when a stranger named Hythe entices, drugs, and kidnaps the trio. He takes them to a remote place and launches them into space, where they are forced to become performers for aliens known as Vexa in Galax-Arena, on the planet Vexak. The Galax-Arena itself is a stadium-type place where human children perform death-defying stunts of gymnastics for a crowd. There are no safety nets, in fact death is sometimes encouraged by their trainer Hythe. As they perform, the Vexa are connected to devices that allow them to feel the adrenaline and danger that the children experience. The children are forced to grow up very quickly in order to survive, but most of them already have, as they were street kids before they were kidnapped. Joella emphasizes the similarities that her, Peter, Liane and all the rest of the children caught on Vexak, share with animals in captivity on Earth. Hythe is their care-taker so the children may hate him for keeping them there, but show something akin to love for him because he feeds and cares for them. At first the three children want to die but slowly they regain the urge to live and they gradually bond with other child performers, collectively calling themselves the Peb as they no longer identify themselves as \\"kids\\" or \\"children\\" or \\"friends\\" any longer. Hythe also encourages antagonism between the children, particularly in the clash that forms between Peter and another boy, Allyman. Those who can't perform, like Joella, and later Mariam, are taken to be pets. It is here Joella discovers that the Peb are not performing for aliens, but for humans in costumes. It is part of an elaborate set up to make the children believe there is no way out, and because they believe it, it becomes true. They are actually still on Earth, but refuse to believe it when faced with the evidence. As a pet, Joella manages to expose the Vexa who she has become the pet of, as an elderly woman, Emmeline. Emmeline reveals to Joella and Mariam that Galax- Arena is part of a massive experiment called ‚ÄòGenesis 5‚Äô to give the extremely rich clientele of Genesis 5 like Emmeline immortality by channeling the Peb‚Äôs adrenalin into the old people‚Äôs bodies to trick the body into thinking it is young and not close to death. Problematic children are killed. Seven of the Peb manage to escape Galax-Arena, though only because they believe that there is hope.

To connect with individual databases, JDBC (the Java Database Connectivity API) requires drivers for each database. The JDBC driver gives out the connection to the database and implements the protocol for transferring the query and result between client and database. JDBC technology drivers fit into one of four categories.Sun JDBC Overview # JDBC-ODBC bridge # Native-API driver # Network- Protocol driver (Middleware driver) # Database-Protocol driver (Pure Java driver) or thin driver. Type 1 driver ‚Äì JDBC-ODBC bridge Schematic of the JDBC-ODBC bridge The JDBC type 1 driver, also known as the JDBC-ODBC bridge, is a database driver implementation that employs the ODBC driver to connect to the database. The driver converts JDBC method calls into ODBC function calls. The driver is platform-dependent as it makes use of ODBC which in turn depends on native libraries of the underlying operating system the JVM is running upon. Also, use of this driver leads to other installation dependencies; for example, ODBC must be installed on the computer having the driver and the database must support an ODBC driver. The use of this driver is discouraged if the alternative of a pure-Java driver is available. The other implication is that any application using a type 1 driver is non-portable given the binding between the driver and platform. This technology isn't suitable for a high- transaction environment. Type 1 drivers also don't support the complete Java command set and are limited by the functionality of the ODBC driver. Sun (now Oracle) provided a JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver: \`sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver\`. This driver is native code and not Java, and is closed source. Sun's/Oracle's JDBC-ODBC Bridge was removed in Java 8 (other vendors' are available).https://www.progress.com/connectors/sequelinkhttp://www.easysoft.com/blog/java-8.html If a driver has been written so that loading it causes an instance to be created and also calls \`DriverManager.registerDriver\` with that instance as the parameter (as it should do), then it is in the DriverManager's list of drivers and available for creating a connection. It may sometimes be the case that more than one JDBC driver is capable of connecting to a given URL. For example, when connecting to a given remote database, it might be possible to use a JDBC-ODBC bridge driver, a JDBC-to-generic-network-protocol driver, or a driver supplied by the database vendor. In such cases, the order in which the drivers are tested is significant because the DriverManager will use the first driver it finds that can successfully connect to the given URL. First the DriverManager tries to use each driver in the order it was registered. (The drivers listed in jdbc.drivers are always registered first.) It will skip any drivers that are untrusted code unless they have been loaded from the same source as the code that is trying to open the connection. It tests the drivers by calling the method Driver.connect on each one in turn, passing them the URL that the user originally passed to the method \`DriverManager.getConnection\`. The first driver that recognizes the URL makes the connection. =Advantages= * Almost any database for which an ODBC driver is installed can be accessed, and data can be retrieved. =Disadvantages= * Performance overhead since the calls have to go through the JDBC( java database connectivity) bridge to the ODBC(open database connectivity) driver, then to the native database connectivity interface (thus may be slower than other types of drivers). * The ODBC driver needs to be installed on the client machine. * Not suitable for applets, because the ODBC driver needs to be installed on the client. * Specific ODBC drivers are not always available on all platforms; hence, portability of this driver is limited. * No support from JDK 1.8 (Java 8). Type 2 driver ‚Äì Native-API driver Schematic of the Native API driver The JDBC type 2 driver, also known as the Native-API driver, is a database driver implementation that uses the client-side libraries of the database. The driver converts JDBC method calls into native calls of the database API. For example: Oracle OCI driver is a type 2 driver. =Advantages= * As there is no implementation of JDBC-ODBC bridge, it may be considerably faster than a Type 1 driver. =Disadvantages= * The vendor client library needs to be installed on the client machine. * Not all databases have a client-side library. * This driver is platform dependent. * This driver supports all Java applications except applets. Type 3 driver ‚Äì Network-Protocol driver (middleware driver)  Schematic of the Network Protocol driver The JDBC type 3 driver, also known as the Pure Java driver for database middleware,http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-5069/ggzci/index.html is a database driver implementation which makes use of a middle tier between the calling program and the database. The middle-tier (application server) converts JDBC calls directly or indirectly into a vendor-specific database protocol. This differs from the type 4 driver in that the protocol conversion logic resides not at the client, but in the middle-tier. Like type 4 drivers, the type 3 driver is written entirely in Java. The same client-side JDBC driver may be used for multiple databases. It depends on the number of databases the middleware has been configured to support. The type 3 driver is platform-independent as the platform-related differences are taken care of by the middleware. Also, making use of the middleware provides additional advantages of security and firewall access. =Functions= * Sends JDBC API calls to a middle-tier net server that translates the calls into the DBMS- specific network protocol. The translated calls are then sent to a particular DBMS. * Follows a three-tier communication approach. * Can interface to multiple databases ‚Äì Not vendor specific. * The JDBC Client driver written in java, communicates with a middleware-net-server using a database independent protocol, and then this net server translates this request into database commands for that database. * Thus the client driver to middleware communication is database independent. =Advantages= * Since the communication between client and the middleware server is database independent, there is no need for the database vendor library on the client. The client need not be changed for a new database. * The middleware server (which can be a full-fledged J2EE Application server) can provide typical middleware services like caching (of connections, query results, etc.), load balancing, logging, and auditing. * A single driver can handle any database, provided the middleware supports it. * E.g.: IDA Server =Disadvantages= * Requires database-specific coding to be done in the middle tier. * The middle ware layer added may result in additional latency, but is typically overcome by using better middle ware services.. Type 4 driver ‚Äì Database-Protocol driver/Thin Driver(Pure Java driver) Schematic of the Native-Protocol driver The JDBC type 4 driver, also known as the Direct to Database Pure Java Driver, is a database driver implementation that converts JDBC calls directly into a vendor-specific database protocol. Written completely in Java, type 4 drivers are thus platform independent. They install inside the Java Virtual Machine of the client. This provides better performance than the type 1 and type 2 drivers as it does not have the overhead of conversion of calls into ODBC or database API calls. Unlike the type 3 drivers, it does not need associated software to work. As the database protocol is vendor specific, the JDBC client requires separate drivers, usually vendor supplied, to connect to different types of databases. =Advantages= * Completely implemented in Java to achieve platform independence. * These drivers don't translate the requests into an intermediary format (such as ODBC). * The client application connects directly to the database server. No translation or middleware layers are used, improving performance. * The JVM can manage all aspects of the application-to- database connection; this can facilitate debugging. =Disadvantages= * Drivers are database specific, as different database vendors use widely different (and usually proprietary) network protocols.

The term was used by the Labour party's opponents and critics, who sometimes extended it to describe the New Zealand of the time as a whole. In January 2008, the term 'Helengrad', \\"a noun used to describe the iron grip of New Zealand's prime minister over Wellington\\", was reported as having made Australia's Macquarie online dictionary among 85 other new words. Origin The Helen aspect is derived from Helen Clark, Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1999 to 2008. The suffix -grad (-–≥—Ä–∞–¥ in Cyrillic) alludes to cities of the former Soviet Union named after political leaders, such as Leningrad and Stalingrad. The term was used derisively by political opponents of Clark and the Labour Party to equate their ideology and political views with socialism and communism. In a similar way they referred to Helen Clark as \\"Comrade Helen\\". Use The term was reputedly first used by a caller to Lindsay Perigo's 'Politically Incorrect Show' on Radio Pacific in late 1999 or early 2000, and went on to gain traction in the media and in political circles following its appearance on the cover of the May/June 2000 issue of the magazine 'The Free Radical,' published early April 2000. A commentary in the Evening Post ascribed the reason to the nickname \\"Does she (Helen Clark) know the Capital's earned the nickname, Helengrad, such is her total command of issues, initiatives and air time?\\" The Evening Post closed and merged with the morning paper the Dominion to become The Dominion Post in July 2002. In a 2000 feature article, \\"Siege of Helengrad,\\" The Australian newspaper wrote that Clark's \\"uncompromisingly autocratic and pervasive leadership has seen New Zealand dubbed Helengrad\\".

The word albatross is sometimes used metaphorically to mean a psychological burden that feels like a curse. It is an allusion to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798). In the poem, an albatross starts to follow a ship ‚Äî being followed by an albatross was generally considered a sign of good luck. However, the titular mariner shoots the albatross with a crossbow, which is regarded as an act that will curse the ship (which indeed suffers terrible mishaps). Even when they are too thirsty to speak, the ship's crew let the mariner know through their glances that they blame his action for the curse. The bird is placed on the sailor's neck by shipmates to show the guilt in killing it. Therefore, the albatross can be both an omen of good or bad luck, as well as a metaphor for a burden to be carried as penance. The symbolism used in the Coleridge poem is its highlight. For example: This sense is catalogued in the Oxford English Dictionary from 1936 and 1955, but it seems only to have entered general usage in the 1960s, or possibly as early as 1959. Also, the word albatross is used in Letter II, Volume One of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, in which Robert Walton is speaking to his sister and states, \\"‚Ä¶but I shall kill no albatross‚Ä¶\\", an allusion quite clearly referring to the poem by her close acquaintance, Coleridge. The novel was first published in 1818, long before the term was introduced into the Oxford Dictionary. Charles Baudelaire's collection of poems Les Fleurs du mal contains a poem entitled \\"L'albatros\\" (1857) about men on ships who catch the albatrosses for sport. In the final stanza, he goes on to compare the poets to the birds ‚Äî exiled from the skies and then weighed down by their giant wings, till death. Finally, in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. Here is a reference to Coleridge's albatross See The Rime of the Ancient Mariner in popular culture. D.H. Lawrence refers to Coleridge's poem when he wrote, \\"And I thought of the albatross\\" in his own poem \\"Snake\\", published in Birds, Beasts and Flowers.

It's becoming a bit of an albatross\\". * In Showtime's Weeds, the main character Nancy refers to another character as, \\"[an] albatross: my own personal cinder block.\\" Season five episode five. *In the HBO series Deadwood, a character refers to the debt owed to blacks because of slavery as an \\"albatross around the white man's neck.\\" Episode 304. *In the TNT series Memphis Beat, a character refers to family as \\"an albatross around the neck of a great man\\" (Episode 107). *The Monty Python team, exploiting absurdist associations of ideas, gave life to the image of having an albatross around one's neck. In their sketch \\"Albatross\\", set in a cinema, an irritated man (John Cleese) dressed as an ice-cream girl tries to sell a dead albatross, the only item he has on his ice-cream tray. *In The New Adventures of Flipper, episode 417 \\"Mystery Ship\\", an abandoned boat, a yawl, is discovered with no one aboard. She is named The Albatross. She isn't registered and doesn't appear in any databases. She appears to be sea worthy, but strange accidents occur. Eventually, the couple who salvaged her argue over whether to keep her or not. Upon further search of the boat, a boat builder's plaque is found. The Albatross was built by a boat builder who went out of business in the late 1930s. This discovery leads to a newspaper article about a murder aboard the boat, the Sweet Charlotte. Apparently over time anyone coming in contact with her has bad luck. She has gone from being named the Sweet Charlotte to The Albatross. * In a flash-back scene of The Sopranos episode, \\"Down Neck\\", Tony's father (\\"Johnny Boy\\") says of his wife, Livia, \\"You're like an albacore around my neck!\\"‚Äîan obvious malapropism. *In season 7, episode 11 of the series The X-Files, entitled \\"Closure\\", Special Agent Fox Mulder discovers a child's handprints embedded in cement in front of a house in the base housing area of what appears to be a decommissioned U.S. Air Force base. The prints are presumably made by his sister, Samantha, after her abduction when she was eight years old. The house where he finds the handprints‚Äîand later a diary, also presumably Samantha's-- is located on Albatross St.; possibly a reference to how Fox's quest to find information about the whereabouts of his missing sister has been his albatross since she was taken from him. *In Season 2, episode 8 of the series Ed, Jim (Molly Hudson's romantic interest) refers to her old car 'Sadie' that she buys back after selling (due to emotional attachment), as a 'Metal Albatross', due to its failure to function, and the fact that they have to push it all the way to her house after buying it back. *In episode 209 of the show Aqua Teen Hunger Force Master Shake states, \\"We got us a super star, and we've got two albacores that are hanging around my neck.\\" Frylock responds, \\"It's albatrosses\\". Master Shake states this to show frustration to his two roommates in response to losing, again, at a bar trivia game. * In Season 5, episode 21 of Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., Sgt. Carter calls Gomer an albatross because he messed up a marine exercise, and is told to go back to the base. When Gomer asks how he'll get back, Carter sarcastically replies,\\"You can fly, Pyle. You're an albatross, remember?!\\" * In season 4 of the HBO series Boardwalk Empire, Nucky Thompson lives in a seaside motel named \\"The Albatross\\"; a metaphor for the mental burden his character suffers. * In season 4, episode 4 of Orange Is The New Black Alex tells Red she is sorry for sharing 'This Albatross of a secret' with her. The famous BBC TV comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus broadcast a sketch called \\"Intermission\\" in Episode 13 of series 1 on 11 January 1970. Although only 40 seconds long this sketch is amongst one of the most memorable and remembered. In it a man, played by John Cleese, is dressed as an ice-cream girl in a film theatre, although instead of the regular movie snacks she is selling a dead albatross. A man (Terry Jones) approaches her and asks for two choc ices. The girl aggressively makes clear she only sells an albatross and continues shouting to draw attention to her merchandise, while the potential customer keeps asking questions about the product, like \\"What flavour is it?\\" and \\"Do you get wafers with it?\\". Finally the man buys two albatrosses for nine pence each. The salesgirl then shouts she is selling \\"gannet on a stick.\\" Later during the episode, several other characters in other sketches shout \\"Albatross\\" for seemingly no reason at all.  Books  * The cover art for Michael Spivak's A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, Vol.2, is a painting by the author featuring a sailing ship beneath a dark stormy sky, full of dead jesters and a single living jester having three albatrosses hanging from ropes around his neck, respectively labeled \\"Cartan\\", \\"Riemann\\", and \\"Gauss\\".  Video games  * In the fantasy MMORPG RuneScape, This Albatross, known formerly as The Scourge, is the flagship of the infamous pirate lord Rabid Jack.

An English translation by Ralph Manheim is available from Princeton University Press under the title Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time. Life Babinger was born in Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Bavaria as the eldest of four children into a middle-class family, the father a Roman Catholic, the mother of Jewish background. He was already an accomplished academic and linguist by the time he had completed his secondary school studies. Prior to starting University, he had already learned both Persian and Hebrew. Babinger completed his doctoral studies at the University of Munich on the eve of the First World War; after the war started, he joined the German Army. Because of his language skills and abilities, Babinger served in the Middle East, thus avoiding the deadly trench warfare that cut short the lives of many promising scholars of his generation. After the war, Babinger continued his studies at Friedrich-Wilhelms Universit√§t in Berlin where he completed his Habilitationsschrift in 1921 and became a professor at the same institution. During this period, he published Geschichtsschreiber der Osmanen und ihre Werke (\\"Historians of the Ottoman Empire\\"), which became the standard bibliographical review of Ottoman historiography and confirmed the reputation of Friedrich-Wilhelms Universit√§t as a leading center for Near East studies. The rise of the Nazis to power in 1933 forced him to resign his position. However, the Romanian statesman, academic and polymath Nicolae Iorga, himself a widely respected historian of the Ottoman Empire, invited Babinger to take up a position in Bucharest, which he held until he was ordered out of the country in 1943. Babinger resumed his teaching career after the Second World War at the University of Munich in 1948 until his retirement in 1958. In 1957, he testified about German atrocities against Romanian Jews. He continued to work and publish actively until his accidental death by drowning in Albania on June 23, 1967. Work In addition to his bibliographical work, Babinger published numerous articles and books on a wide variety of subjects. Babinger knew Turkish, Romanian and Arabic as well as the principal European languages, giving his work a scope and authority that had hitherto rarely been displayed in Near Eastern studies. As a result of his reputation, his magnum opus Mehmed the Conqueror was published without any accompanying notes on source material at all, since the companion volume outlining his extensive and voluminous sources was unfinished at the time of his death. As a result, Mehmed the Conqueror is one of the few academic works available with no cited sources and whose authority rests solely on the reputation of the author's research abilities. Critics like Prof. Halil Inalcik from the University of Ankara have said they were waiting for the author's promised second edition as stated in the preface of the book that would include the source material and bibliography; since such edition never saw the light, the students of the subject could easily recognize the source material, evidencing the use of biased bibliography exclusively.Dr. Prof. Halil Inalcik Review of MEHMED THE CONQUEROR (1432-1481) AND HIS TIME (http://www.inalcik.com/images/pdfs/54847543MEHMEDTHECONQUEROR.pdf) Principal Publications :Geschichtsschreiber der Osmanen und ihre Werke (1923) :Mehmed der Eroberer und seine Zeit (1953) References External links * Category:German biographers Category:Male biographers Category:German orientalists Category:1891 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Accidental deaths in Albania Category:German male non-fiction writers Category:20th-century German historians Category:Members of the Lincean Academy Category:Ottoman studies ","title":"Franz Babinger"},{"id":"3001697","text":"Taishi Village () is a small hamlet (population about 2,000), in the town of Dongchong, Nansha District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, formerly in the now- disbanded Yuwotou Town () of Panyu District, Guangzhou.

Crash reports often include data such as stack traces, type of crash, trends and version of software. These reports help software developers- Web, SAAS, mobile apps and more, to diagnose and fix the underlying problem causing the crashes. Crash reports may contain sensitive information such as passwords, email addresses, and contact information, and so have become objects of interest for researchers in the field of computer security. Implementing crash reporting tools as part of the development cycle has become a standard, and crash reporting tools have become a commodity, many of them are offered for free, like Crashlytics. Many giant industry players, that are part of the software development eco-system have entered the game. Companies such as Twitter, Google and others are putting a lot of efforts on encouraging software developers to use their APIs, knowing this will increase their revenues down the road (through advertisements and other mechanisms). As they realize that they must offer elegant solutions for as many as possible development issues, otherwise their competitors will take actions, they keep adding advanced features. Crash reporting tools make an important development functionality that giant companies include in their portfolio of solutions. Many crash reporting tools are specialized in mobile app. Many of them are SDKs.  macOS  In macOS there is a standard crash reporter in . Crash Reporter.app sends the Unix crash logs to Apple for their engineers to look at. The top text field of the window has the crash log, while the bottom field is for user comments. Users may also copy and paste the log in their email client to send to the application vendor for them to use. Crash Reporter.app has 3 main modes: display nothing on crash, display \\"Application has crashed\\" dialog box or display Crash Report window.  Windows  Microsoft Windows includes a crash reporting service called Windows Error Reporting that prompts users to send crash reports to Microsoft for online analysis.Using Microsoft Online Crash Analysis The information goes to a central database run by Microsoft. It consists of diagnostic information that helps the company or development team responsible for the crash to debug and resolve the issue if they choose to do so. Crash reports for third party software are available to third party developers who have been granted access by Microsoft. The system considers all parts of the debug and release process, such that targeted bug fixes can be applied through Windows Update. In other words, only people experiencing a particular type of crash can be offered the bug fix, thus limiting exposure to an issue. According to Der Spiegel, the Microsoft crash reporter has been exploited by NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit to hack into the computers of Mexico's Secretariat of Public Security. According to the same source, Microsoft crash reports are automatically harvested in NSA's XKeyscore database, in order to facilitate such operations.http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-nsa-uses- powerful-toolbox-in-effort-to-spy-on-global-networks-a-940969-2.html = CrashRpt = Another error reporting library for Windows is CrashRpt. CrashRpt library is a light-weight open source error handling framework for applications created in Microsoft Visual C++ and running under Windows. The library is distributed under New BSD License. CrashRpt intercepts unhandled exceptions, creates a crash minidump file, builds a crash descriptor in XML format, presents an interface to allow user to review the crash report, and finally it compresses and sends the crash report to the software support team. CrashRpt also provides a server-side command line tool for crash report analysis named crprober. The tool is able to read all received crash reports from a directory and generate a summary file in text format for each crash report. It also groups similar crash reports making it easier to determine the most popular problems. The crprober tool does not provide any graphical interface, so it is rather cryptic and difficult to use. There is also an open-source server software named CrashFix Server that can store, organize and analyze crash reports sent by CrashRpt library. It can group similar crash reports, has a built-in bug tracker and can generate statistical reports.

Life and career Hamilton was born on October 17881787 Dictionary of Hamilton Biography in Queenston Heights. The son of wealthy and influential Scottish-born Queenston merchant Robert Hamilton, who later held important government offices, being a member of the Legislative Council and lieutenant of the County of Lincoln, and of Catherine Askin Robertson, Hamilton was educated in Edinburgh, Scotland and appears to have possessed a keen mind for business and letters. The Scottish schooling of the era would have exposed him to moral philosophy and what later became the separate discipline of economics. It is likely that his education fostered scepticism as well as a commitment to freedom of religion and the right to hold dissenting opinions, attitudes that would surface in his political career. He married Maria Lavinia Jarvis in 1811. Hamilton also served during the War of 1812, where he held the rank of captain with the Niagara Light Dragoons, participating in the capture of Detroit and the Battle of Queenston Heights and Lundy's Lane. During 1814, British troops billeted at his Queenston establishment burned the property. This loss, combined with a familiarity with the Head of the Lake acquired during the war when Burlington Heights was heavily garrisoned, may have prompted George Hamilton's purchase of of Barton Township from James Durand, in January 1815. Well placed and shrewd, Hamilton likely knew of prewar discussions about creating a new administrative district with a judicial centre. Within a year of his land purchase, Hamilton reached agreement with the owner of adjacent property to the north, Nathaniel Hughson, on a scheme which they calculated would increase the possibility of having the court-house and jail for the new district located on Hamilton lands, to the benefit of the values of both men's property. Together they empowered James Durand to lobby at the House of Assembly for the Hamilton townsite and to act as an agent selling town lots. The instructions coincided with the very week that the assembly and Legislative Council deliberated on the formation of the new district and the designation of a district town; the act was passed on 22 March 1816. The precise manoevres cannot be documented, but there is little doubt that the origins of the Hamilton town site, and its location back from the waterfront, derived from a complicated private affair involving Messrs. Hamilton, Hughson, and Durand. The new town was to become the capital of the new Gore District. Hamilton provided land for a courthouse and jail. The police village of Hamilton was incorporated in 1833. The offer they made to the government of Upper Canada included the granting of two blocks of land of each to the Crown. These were to be reserved for the construction of public buildings. The overall design of the townsite, likely conceived in 1816, was commonplace. George Hamilton employed a grid street pattern used in most towns in Upper Canada and throughout the American frontier. The eighty original lots had frontages of fifty feet; each lot faced a broad street and backed onto a twelve-foot lane. It took at least a decade for all of the original lots to be sold, but the construction of the Burlington Canal in 1823, and a new court- house in 1827, encouraged Hamilton to add more blocks around 1828‚Äì29. At that time, he included a market square in an effort to draw commercial activity onto his lands, but the natural growth of the town was to the north of Hamilton's plot. As a private town developer, Hamilton's record was mixed; he literally created the town, but he clearly tried to shape it to benefit his private fortunes. The market ploy, a successful petition for the crown to return one of the original squares, and eventual disputes over ownership of \\"the Gore\\" indicate his manipulative efforts. All the same, he left enduring marks on the urban landscape; the court-house square, the haymarket, \\"the Gore\\", and the basic street plan of the city core. Hamilton represented the riding of Wentworth in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada from 1821 to 1830, where he tended to support moderate reformers and encourage immigration to Canada. He helped set up a canal to link Hamilton harbour to Lake Ontario and worked to secure funding for the court house and jail. Hamilton died on February 20, 1836, and was buried at the family burial plot on the family's farm. His remains, along with the remains of other members of his family that were buried there, were later removed to the Hamilton lot in Hamilton Cemetery in Section Z (Lots 431 etc). Hamilton was one of a handful of important Canadians who recognized the colony's special needs and possibilities at an early date.

Though the instrumentation is as complex as on the band's previous releases, the vocals mostly take the form of spoken word. At points Eleanor Friedberger speaks or sings words corresponding to the character of a younger Olga Sarantos, the two engaging in dialogue.

It also includes a few sections separate from the main story. In the album's press release, Matthew Friedberger, the songwriter and lyricist, gives a summary and explanation: Dear Listener, Tracks 3 and 4 take place in the 40s; tracks 5 and 6 in the 20s and 30s; track 7 in the later 50s; track 8 starts in the very early 40s; track 9 goes back and forth; track 10 takes place in the early 60s; the final track takes place in the early 90s. Track 2 takes place a few years ago; track 1 took place when it was recorded. The action depicted in \\"The Wayward Granddaughter\\" and \\"Slavin' Away\\" does not include the character Olga Sarantos plays on the rest of the record. \\"Slavin' Away\\" imagines that character‚Äîthe main character‚Äîfantasizing, a bit remotely, about the hard lot of other women. Now, I wouldn't guess that the Main Character actually thought the woman concerned was riding around in a Norton side-car and operating her own cottage industry trinket assembly/sweatshop: but it might have pleased her to picture it so. \\"The Wayward Granddaughter\\" is about a different Greek-American grandmother and her popular granddaughter (\\"Connie\\"). They're from Chicago's south suburbs and don't figure in the rest of the record; I wanted to have another (slightly younger) grandmother and family in there for perspective or comparison's sake, so to speak. Thank you for your time, Matthew Friedberger Critical response Like much of the band's output, the album received both enthusiastically positive and negative reviews from music critics. JSpicer at Tiny Mix Tapes called it a \\"Great American Novel via guitars, drums, bells, and whistles\\" and admired its envelope-pushing sound and unique storytelling.

Their headquarters and custom shops are located in Markneukirchen, Shanghai, New York City, and Nashville.  Timeline  * 1946: The foundation of Fr√§nkische Musikinstrumentenerzeugung (\\"Franconian Musical Instruments Fabrication\\") by Fred A. Wilfer KG in Erlangen, Germany to help resettle luthiers displaced from Sch√∂nbach (as of 1946, named Luby) in the Sudetenland. * 1954: A larger factory is built in Bubenreuth, Germany to house the 300-strong workforce. * 1967: Further expansion sees the building of a second facility in Pretzfeld, Germany. * 1975: The rapidly changing market forces the company into bankruptcy. * 1995: Framus musical instruments enter into production under Warwick GmbH & Co Music Equipment KG.  History  = Early years = Framus originated in the town of Sch√∂nbach, today called Luby (Cheb District) in the Czech Republic. The city at the foot of the Erzgebirge was shaped by the music. Violins and other string instruments have been manufactured and exported from Sch√∂nbach worldwide. There, in the Bohemian area, the founder of Framus, Fred Wilfer was born in 1917. After World War II, when he heard about plans to expel Sudeten Germans from post-War II Czechoslovakia, he decided to build up a new basis for his countryman and the music industry in the west. Even before the first train was going to transport violin makers from Sch√∂nbach to other areas, Fred Wilfer contacted different government authorities in Bavaria and told them about his plans. The Bavarian government welcomed his plans and asked him to create all conditions needed for the settlement to Bavaria. In 1946 he founded the FRAMUS works... the name being an acronym of FRAnconian MUSical instruments and designed to draw attention to the fact that the celebrated violin makers of Sch√∂nbach had made Franconia their new home. When the first train transporting violin makers from Sch√∂nbach arrived in Erlangen he was the man in charge to find housing for them. He also made arrangements for the establishment of the first workshops. = Progress = In March 1946 the first group of Sch√∂nbach violin makers arrived in Erlangen, with Fred Wilfer and the refugee commission arranging accommodations. A factory was set up in a former wheel warehouse in M√∂hrendorf in autumn 1946. At the end of 1948 the factory was moved to a former brewery in the nearby town of Baiersdorf. Soon, even this large space proved inadequate. In late 1949 Bubenreuth became the center of settlement for the Sch√∂nbach violin makers. There, Wilfer began building one of the most modern factories of the time, and in the summer of 1954 about 170 employees went to work at the new facility. With 2200 square meters of space at their disposal, they were soon producing more than 2000 instruments in a month.

Sales increased enormously due to the popularity of rock and roll music at the end of the 1950s. Because of this development, several technologic advances were introduced (such as putting truss rods in guitar necks), and a second factory was built in Pretzfeld, 25 km north of Bubenreuth in the Franconian Switzerland, in 1966. Framus became the largest guitar producer in Europe, employing around 300 workers by the late 1960s. In the 50s Paul McCartney owned a model of a Framus Ivor Mairants \\"Zenith\\" guitar. He had originally been given a trumpet for his 14th birthday in 1956 but he learned he could not possibly sing playing a trumpet so he swapped it for a Framus \\"Zenith\\" model 17. He used it to compose some of his first songs with it including \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". It still hangs in his studio. While their guitars were more popular by far, Framus made other stringed instruments. Their four-string tenor banjos in particular were very popular among Irish traditional musicians. The company included a musical kindergarten in the Bubenreuth factory. Supported by a young teacher, Gertrud Fischer and a book that used little, colored \\"note men\\" that helped children start learning musical notation at the age of three. Visitors to the factory in Bubenreuth included the Vienna Saengerknaben (Boys Choir), who delivered a special concert in the Framus workshops, and German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who toured the factory and its musical kindergarten during a visit to the violin- making-village. = Bankruptcy = In an interview Fred Wilfer summarized his all-embracing concept with the following words: It's not only important to produce instruments, over a long period it is important to \\"produce customers\\". This motto is found in other Framus projects, as well. Eventually the price dumping by companies from Japan along with other factors, both external and internal forced Framus into bankruptcy at the end of the 1970s. Many aspects of the history of Framus are still in the dark. This is due to the bankruptcy of the company when almost the whole archives were lost. = Framus today = In 1995, Hans-Peter Wilfer (son of founder Fred Wilfer) revived the Framus name to produce musical instruments as part of Warwick GmbH & Co Music Equipment KG in Markneukirchen, Germany. Along with a range of electric guitars, the company produces replacement parts (such as knobs, tuners, bridges, and tailpieces) for their vintage models, and a small range of high-end tube amplifiers.  Notable users  In the early 1960s, Framus Star Bass guitars were among the first bass guitars imported into Britain.

The power plant consisted of two units built in the 1960s, each capable of producing 150 MW of electricity. Its smokestack, built in 1981, was over 300 metres (1000 feet) tall, making it Germany's tallest chimney at the time. The power station was decommissioned on May 13, 2005. The chimney was demolished on Sunday, December 3, 2006, at 10:53 a.m. The height of the smokestack, 300 metres, has been confirmed by the former operator of the power plant, E.ON Kraftwerke. It was the tallest structure in North Rhine-Westphalia. Before its erection the Wesel transmitter tower took this claim. After the demolition of the chimney, the Wesel tower once again became the tallest structure in North Rhine- Westphalia. A district heating plant, \\"FWK Westerholt\\", has been in operation on this site since the spring of 2004. There are six boilers there to provide heat for the district heating network of the northern Ruhr Area. The Westerholt coal mine is located only a few hundred metres away. Both the power plant and the mine are on the city limits of Gelsenkirchen in the Hassel neighborhood and were named for the contiguous (and at that time still independent) city of Westerholt in what was then the district of Recklinghausen (today the city is a part of the city of Herten and is named \\"Herten-Westerholt\\").

It is located at street level at the end of Station Road in Gowerton west of Swansea. The station is unmanned but has a ticket machine, shelters on each platform and live train running information displays. Background Gowerton station was opened as Gower Road by the South Wales Railway on Tuesday 1 August 1854 Article cites a contemporary report in The Cambrian newspaper. It was later renamed Gowerton, following a request to the railway company by the parish vestry, and from 1950 became known as Gowerton North to distinguish it from the Gowerton South railway station which served the now closed Pontarddulais to Swansea Victoria section of the Heart of Wales line until 1964. History Gowerton station in June 2006 The station originally had two platforms, sited on the section between Cockett station and Duffryn, but the track was singled in 1986 as an economy measure. Network Rail planned to re-double the section of railway through this station and re-instate the disused east-bound platform in May 2012. Work commenced in March 2013 and was completed a month later. This has increased the capacity of this section of line and allowed more trains to stop at this station. The re-doubling work was completed in July 2013 with the disused platform brought back into use. This resulted in an additional 95 services stopping at Gowerton every week and this has also helped to increase passenger usage at the station, which has risen by 2,100% since 1998. Services Gowerton is served approximately every hour by Transport for Wales services heading westbound towards Llanelli, where they continue to either West Wales or to Shrewsbury via the Heart of Wales line; and eastbound towards , with many continuing further east to , and Manchester Piccadilly. The station was originally a request stop, but on 9 September 2013, it was no longer listed as one.

Life and career Fisher was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, the son of Genevieve (Clark) and Frederick George Fisher. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1942, summa cum laude. After serving in the Army Signal Corps during World War II, he attended Harvard Law School. He graduated in 1948 and joined the law firm of Hale and Dorr in Boston. In 1954, the firm represented the U.S. Army at the Army‚ÄìMcCarthy hearings on Senator Joseph McCarthy's conduct. Fisher and James D. St. Clair were the two attorneys initially sent to Washington, D.C. to assist Joseph Welch. On questioning them, Welch learned of Fisher's having belonged to the National Lawyers Guild while in law school and shortly after. Welch decided that that left-wing association made Fisher's participation in the hearings a potential problem, and a colleague, John Kimball, Jr., replaced Fisher on the case. Fisher's name was prominently publicized when McCarthy intimated on national television that Welch should get Fisher fired as a Communist, and that Welch had specifically chosen him for the abortive assignment. In response, Welch delivered the most memorable lines from the McCarthy Hearings: Welch dismissed Fisher's association with the NLG as a youthful indiscretion and attacked McCarthy for naming the young man before a nationwide television audience without prior warning or previous agreement to do so: When McCarthy tried to renew his attack, Welch interrupted him: McCarthy tried to ask Welch another question about Fisher, and Welch cut him off: The gallery erupted in applause. These proceedings have been recorded in the documentary film Point of Order. Fisher's work for the Lawyers Guild had been confirmed by Welch several weeks earlier in a New York Times article, which in turn led McCarthy to insinuate that Fisher was a Communist during the hearings. Fisher went on to become a partner at Hale and Dorr. In 1973‚Äì74, he served as president of the Massachusetts Bar Association. 1989 Fisher died in Tel Aviv, Israel, where he was lecturing. In his New York Times obituary, Fisher was referred to as a \\"McCarthy target.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/27/obituaries/frederick-g- fisher-68-was-a-mccarthy-target.html Legacy In the 1977 made-for- television film Tail Gunner Joe, the scene was re-enacted with Burgess Meredith portraying Welch and Peter Boyle as McCarthy.

The Armenian historian Stepanos Nazarian described him as the \\"second Mesrop Mashtots\\". The cause for his beatification was accepted by the Holy See, due to which he is referred to as a Servant of God. Life =Early life= He was born Manugh in Sebaste (now Sivas) in Lesser Armenia on 17 February 1676, the son of a prosperous merchant Peter and his wife Shahristan. His parents gave him a good education to prepare him to assume the family business. Instead, from an early age, he wanted to become a monk. Refused permission for this, he found a young companion to flee to the mountains where they might live as hermits. Quickly found by his parents he was returned home. As a result of this, the bishop who the abbot of the nearby Monastery of Surp Nshan (Holy Cross) conferred minor orders on the boy so that he might assist at the liturgical services of the monastery. Still refused permission to enter the monastery by his parents, he began to frequent a neighboring family which consisted of a mother and her two daughters who lived a monastic form of life in their home, which they shared with an elderly priest, who then taught him about the Divine Office. At the age of fifteen, Manugh finally received the permission he had long sought from his family and he entered the nearby monastery, where he was quickly ordained a deacon. It was at this point that he changed his name to the one he is now known by, Mekhitar (The Consoler). =Monk= After his admittance to monastic life, Mekhitar began to see that the state of monastic life was extremely low after the devastating destruction of the Armenian monasteries in previous centuries. He began to seek out a source of true learning of the spiritual life, being taken to various monasteries by several traveling religious scholars who promised to teach him what he sought if he would serve them. During this period, he came into contact with members of the Roman Catholic religious orders who were active in Armenia. Learning about Catholicism, he came to feel that Rome would be the best place to do the theological studies he had long sought. Finally, upon reaching Aleppo, he placed himself under the spiritual direction of a Jesuit priest, who gave him a letter of introduction to the Congregation of the Propaganda. He determined to set out for there, but received many setbacks of both health and the rejection of those Armenian monks and bishops along the way who rejected Western doctrines. Finally he was forced to return to his home town, walking barefoot, though he was suffering from jaundice. Slowly regaining his health there, in 1696 he was ordained a priest by the Abbot of Holy Cross Monastery. =Founder= Inspired by the idea of creating a religious order of preachers dedicated to raising the educational and spiritual level of the Armenian people, based on the models of the Western Church, Mekhitar founded in 1701 in Constantinople what would become known after his death as the Mekhitarist Order. Two years later, escaping persecution by the Ottoman authorities, the order moved to Modon in the Peloponnese, then known as the Morea, which was a Venetian possession. In 1715, the order moved to the Island of San Lazzaro degli Armeni at the invitation of the Venetian Republic. Mekhitar built up the monastery on the island and the order which sent out priests to serve Armenian communities in the Middle East. Mekhitar died at the monastery on 27 April 1749 and is buried in the monastery church. Veneration The cause for Mekhitar's beatification, which would normally have been able to start fifty years after his death was disrupted by the events of the invasion of Italy by the armies of Revolutionary France under Napoleon, in the course of which almost all monasteries were closed. It was begun about 1895 under the Patriarch of Venice, Giuseppe Sarto. In 1914, after his election as Pope Pius X, the cause was formally accepted by Holy See.

Taking inspiration from \\"The Night Before Christmas\\", the attraction retells the story of Jack Skellington (as \\"Sandy Claws\\") visiting the Haunted Mansion on Christmas Eve, leaving holiday chaos in his wake. The Haunted Mansion typically closes for two and half weeks in late summer so it can be converted into the Haunted Mansion Holiday. The overlaid attraction is then open to guests from late-September through early January before being closed again to remove the overlay.  History  Two similar overlays ‚Äì Country Bear Christmas Special and It's a Small World Holiday ‚Äì had already been successful for some time when Haunted Mansion Holiday was developed. Initially, Disney considered doing a retelling of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, but decided against it due to the attraction's setting in New Orleans Square and the incongruity of bringing Santa Claus into the eerie environment of the Haunted Mansion. Instead, they decided to base it on The Nightmare Before Christmas after considering which Disney character would celebrate Christmas in the Haunted Mansion, should Santa Claus ever land there on his journey. Steve Davison took the idea and worked with Walt Disney Creative Entertainment to develop the overlay. One issue Disney had to deal with was the fact that many of the key performers in the original attraction ‚Äì Paul Frees, Leota Toombs, Eleanor Audley, most of the singing busts, and almost all of the original voice actors ‚Äì had died years earlier. Paul Frees was replaced in his role as the Ghost Host by Corey Burton, who had done voiceover work with Disney before and had also served as Frees' protege prior to the latter's death. Leota Toombs' daughter, Kim Irvine, resembled her mother and was thus chosen to perform in her place as Madame Leota. Susan Blakeslee (impersonating Eleanor Audley) provides the voice of Madame Leota. The singing busts were topped with Jack-O-Lanterns and given computer-animated singing projections. New voice actors were picked for the graveyard ghosts that sound similar to the originals (with the exception of the Headsman Trio; The Knight and Executioner seem to have had their voices swapped). Haunted Mansion Holiday opened October 3, 2001, and quickly became popular with guests, leading to the attraction's FastPass machines being activated during the overlay (they are now always active). On September 13, 2013 (Friday the 13th), the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland opened to the public outfitted with new effects and set pieces in celebration of its 13th year. Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris do not have seasonal overlays. Outside of Phantom Manor, guests can get their photo taken with Jack and Sally.  Storyline  The Haunted Mansion Holiday takes place shortly after the events of the film it conjoins with, The Nightmare Before Christmas, where Jack Skellington, who tried to create his very own twisted Christmas in a Halloween-style overlay in the movie, now discovers the Haunted Mansion, home to 999 Happy Haunts. Deciding to spread joy to the mansion's gloomy residents for the holidays, Jack and his creepy crew from Halloween Town bring hundreds of Jack's original evil Christmas presents and decorations to the manor and deck the haunting grounds for a thrilling and chilling holiday for the Grim Grinning Ghosts inhabiting the abandoned house, setting the stage for the ride itself.  Attraction  Upon visiting the mansion, guests first see that the facade has been completely redecorated, with jack-o-lanterns and candles. Jack's sleigh is on the roof. In the foyer, a grim rendition of Making Christmas plays while the Ghost Host begins to tell the story of what is happening at the mansion. A picture of Jack Skellington slowly changes into Jack dressed as \\"Sandy Claws\\". Doors open, letting guests into the famous octagonal portrait gallery (the Stretching Room). Large stained glass paintings depicting innocent Christmas scenes replace the original four paintings from the normal Haunted Mansion theme. After the doors close shut, all goes dark with the horrendous sound of the paintings breaking in half. The room begins to stretch, the tension rises, and with a thunderclap, Jack's face appears in the cupola above, shouting: \\"Happy Holidays, Everyone!\\" Since 2013, the ceiling has been retooled to depict a stained glass wreath, changing color as the room stretches. It will shatter twice, once in the face of a grinning pumpkin head, then entirely to reveal a fully animated Jack Skellington looking down upon guests. When the lights come back on, the Ghost Host can still be seen in the rafters. A dreadful scream and the shattering of bones is heard, and the doors reopen. Guests are led into the Loading Area, where they board their Doom Buggy to begin the tour. From above, Jack greets guests with Sally and the Vampire Teddy. Down another hallway, paintings of characters from Halloween Town watch guests' every move. In the library, Zero has created a spinning Christmas tree of books, wrapped in garlands. The staring busts remain. The Doom Buggies then float into the Music Room, where Sally sits, listening to the Vampire Teddy play for her rapidly on the piano. As guests glide upstairs, insects shiver in fear inside of cages, with tags reading, \\"To Oogie\\". Oogie's shadow can be seen dancing on the face of the moon and turning into a Christmas tree. Guests float past an Endless Hallway, with bone decor all around. Zero, Jack's dog floats inside, barking happily. In the Conservatory, a group of flowers has sprung to life and now forms the choir. A man tries to escape his Christmas- wrapped coffin, but the Vampire Teddy Bear sits atop, hammer and nails in hand. The hallway, which guests travel through backwards, has been redecorated as well, with skulls and garlands. Doors on either side make strange noises, as though something on the other side were trying to get out. A monstrous man- eating wreath waits above the guests, reaching out to grab them. More of the comically vicious flowers seem to be sprouting from it. The possessed grandfather clock chimes 13 as the hands spin wildly backwards, and a note reads \\"To Leota: 13 Special Gifts for You! -Sandy Claws\\" In the Seance Room, Madame Leota recites the \\"13 Days of Christmas\\", her 13 Christmas gifts. Tarot cards showing all of her gifts float about the room, while the Vampire Teddy Bear rings bells maniacally. A zombified nutcracker imitates Leota chanting her incantations. The Happy Haunts finally begin to materialize in the Ballroom. An immense, dead Christmas tree is in the middle of the room, with glowing skull and jack-o-lantern ornaments and ascending and descending spider ornaments. Ghosts dance right through the tree while a ghost organist plays Kidnap the Sandy Claws as a waltz. In the Anaheim version, a large, moving gingerbread house sits at the center of the Ballroom table. The gingerbread house has greatly different designs from year to year, from a working carousel to an Iron Maiden. In Tokyo, a large cake resembling a snow-covered Spiral Hill from the movie is on the table instead of a gingerbread house, and does not annually change. In the Attic, all of Jack's presents have been stored. Ghastly, glowing presents lie about the room, jack-in-the-boxes popping up to scare passing guests. A snake, having eaten some presents, sits with Jack's Naughty and Nice list hanging out of its mouth. The Graveyard has been completely covered in snow and the spiral hill from Halloween Town sits in the middle of the graveyard, covered with snow and singing, glowing jack-o- lanterns. Jack Skellington greets guests at the gates, wishing them a Merry Christmas with Zero. A quintet of busts have been topped with singing jack-o- lanterns while the graveyard ghosts sing about their perfect Christmas. Ghosts ride around on bicycles with Jack's bonedeer. Giant ice angels with jack-o- lantern heads blow on their horns overhead. Guests finally enter the exit crypt, as the Vampire Teddy Bear plays his own little horn to say goodbye. The Ghost Host warns guests about followers, as Lock, Shock, and Barrel playfully peek out of presents. Gilded mirrors surround the next walls, and in those mirrors, Lock, Shock, or Barrel sit in your car. Sally can then be seen, waving to Jack as he leaves, crossing the face of the moon and wishing her a Merry Christmas. Guests then disembark their Doom Buggy, hearing the ghosts play a jazzy tune to give them something to remember after they leave. Additions Disneyland offers an \\"Oogie Boogie's Holiday Tricks and Treats\\" scavenger hunt. Oogie has hidden cameos throughout the mansion, which guests are asked to look for. For instance, Oogie can be found in shrubbery in the gardens, a shadow on the Christmas card, a doll in the attic, etc.  Soundtrack  The attraction's musical score was originally composed by Gordon Goodwin. It was replaced in 2002 with an adapted score by John Debney, based on themes from the film's soundtrack composed by Danny Elfman. Since 2003, Goodwin's original music has been used in the stretching rooms and the exit crypt (where Goodwin's attic music is used), while the rest of Elfman's score remains. Several characters in the ride are voiced by the original actors from the film, and the various sound effects are a mixture of tracks from the original attraction and new ones.

A rootless cone, also formerly called a pseudocrater, is a volcanic landform which resembles a true volcanic crater, but differs in that it is not an actual vent from which lava has erupted. They are characterised by the absence of any magma conduit which connects below the surface of a planet. Rootless cones are formed by steam explosions as flowing hot lava crosses over a wet surface, such as a swamp, a lake, or a pond. The explosive gases break through the lava surface in a manner similar to a phreatic eruption, and the tephra builds up crater-like forms which can appear very similar to real volcanic craters. Well known examples are found in Iceland such as the craters in the lake M√Ωvatn (Sk√∫tusta√∞ag√≠gar), the Rau√∞h√≥lar in the region of the capital city Reykjav√≠k or the Landbrotsh√≥lar of South-Iceland's Katla UNESCO Global Geopark near Kirkjub√¶jarklaustur.

Either simple or complex stanzaic verse-forms may be used, but there will usually be a large cast, multiple voices, dialogue, narration, description, and action in a novelistic manner.  History  Verse narratives are as old as the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad, and the Odyssey, but the verse novel is a distinct modern form. Although the narrative structure is similar to that of a novella, the organisation of the story is usually in a series of short sections, often with changing perspectives. Verse novels are often told with multiple narrators, potentially providing readers with a view into the inner workings of the characters' minds. Some verse novels, following Byron's mock-heroic Don Juan (1818‚Äì24) employ an informal, colloquial register. Eugene Onegin (1831) by Alexander Pushkin is a classical example, and with Pan Tadeusz (1834) by Adam Mickiewicz is often taken as the seminal example of the modern genre.For discussion of the basic categorical issues see The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993), s.v. 'Narrative Poetry'. The major nineteenth-century verse novels that ground the form in Anglophone letters include The Bothie of Toper-na-fuisich (1848) and Amours de Voyage (1858) by Arthur Hugh Clough, Aurora Leigh (1857) by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Lucile (1860) by 'Owen Meredith' (Robert Bulwer- Lytton), and The Ring and the Book (1868-9) by Robert Browning. The form appears to have declined with Modernism, but has since the 1960s-70s undergone a remarkable revival. Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire (1962) takes the form of a 999-line poem four cantos, though the plot of the novel unfolds in the commentary. Of particular note, Vikram Seth's The Golden Gate (1986) was a surprise bestseller, and Derek Walcott's Omeros (1990) a more predictable success.The upturn is noted in J. A. Cuddon, ed., A Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory (4th ed., rev. C. E. Preston, Oxford & malden, MA: Blackwells, 1998; Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1999), s.v. 'verse-novel'. The form has been particularly popular in the Caribbean, with work since 1980 by Walcott, Edward Kamau Brathwaite, David Dabydeen, Kwame Dawes, Ralph Thompson, George Elliott Clarke and Fred D'Aguiar, and in Australia and New Zealand, with work since 1990 by Les Murray, John Tranter, Dorothy Porter, Lisa Jacobson, Chris Orsman, David Foster, Alistair Te Ariki Campbell, and Robert Sullivan.These geographical clusters are noted and discussed in the editorial introduction to Ralph Thompson, View from Mount Diablo, An Annotated Edition (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, & Tirril: Humanities-Ebooks, 2009). Australian poet-author Alan Wearne's Night Markets, and sequels, are major verse novels of urban social life and satire. The Australian poet, C.J. Dennis, had great success in Australia during World War I with his verse novels, The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke (1915), and The Moods of Ginger Mick (1916). The first tells of an urban ruffian with a heart of gold who marries and becomes a father and a farmer in Melbourne, Australia, shortly before the start of World War I in 1914. The second is the story of another urban ruffian, and good friend of The Bloke, who enlists in the Australian Army, and dies in the early battles at Gallipoli in 1915. The American author, poet, dramatist, screenwriter and suffragist and feminist, Alice Duer Miller published her verse novel, Forsaking All Others (1935), about a tragic love affair, and had a surprising hit with her verse novel, The White Cliffs (1940: later dramatised and filmed, but retaining and expanding the poems as voice-over narration, as The White Cliffs of Dover (1944). This told the story of a young American woman who goes to England in mid-1914, for a fortnight, falls in love with an American aristocrat, and marries him: he is killed in the last days of the First World War in 1918, and when World War II breaks out in 1939, she must decide whether or not to let her son join the army to fight for England. The story helped sway American sentiment towards helping the British, and was a best-seller. Miller‚Äôs poem-chapters were mainly traditional couplets, quatrains, and sonnets. They used several different voices, as well as letters from different characters. The parallel history of the verse autobiography, from strong Victorian foundation with Wordsworth's The Prelude (1805, 1850), to decline with Modernism and later twentieth-century revival with John Betjeman's Summoned by Bells (1960), Walcott's Another Life (1973), and James Merrill's The Changing Light at Sandover (1982), is also striking. The forms are distinct, but many verse novels plainly deploy autobiographical elements, and the recent Commonwealth examples almost all offer detailed representation of the (problems besetting) post-imperial and post-colonial identity, and so are inevitably strongly personal works. There is also a distinct cluster of verse novels for younger readers, most notably Karen Hesse's Out of the Dust (1997), which won a Newbery Medal. Hesse followed it with Witness (2001). Since then, many new titles have cropped up, with authors Sonya Sones, Ellen Hopkins, Steven Herrick, Margaret Wild, Nikki Grimes, Virginia Euwer Wolff, Ann Warren Turner, Lorie Ann Grover, Brenda Seabrooke, Paul B. Janeczko, and Mel Glenn all publishing multiple titles. Debut YA authors, Holly Thompson, Cathy Ostlere, Sarah Tregay, and others have added new titles to the shelves in 2011. Thanhha Lai's Inside Out & Back Again (2011) won the National Book Award.  Versification  Long classical verse narratives were in stichic forms, prescribing a metre but not specifying any interlineal relations. This tradition is represented in English letters by the use of blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter), as by both Brownings and many later poets. But since Petrarch and Dante complex stanza forms have also been used for verse narratives, including terza rima (ABA BCB CDC etc.) and ottava rima (ABABABCC), and modern poets have experimented widely with adaptations and combinations of stanza-forms. The stanza most specifically associated with the verse novel is the Onegin stanza, invented by Pushkin in Eugene Onegin. It is an adapted form of the Shakespearean sonnet, retaining the three quatrains plus couplet structure but reducing the metre to iambic tetrameter and specifying a distinct rhyme scheme: the first quatrain is cross-rhymed (ABAB), the second couplet-rhymed (CCDD), and the third arch-rhymed (or chiasmic, EFFE), so that the whole is ABABCCDDEFFEGG.For detailed discussion of the Onegin stanza see the introduction in Eugene Onegin: A Novel in Verse by Aleksandr Pushkin. Translated from the Russian, with a Commentary by Vladimir Nabokov (rev. ed., in 4 vols, London: Routledge Kegan Paul, 1975), especially i.10 ff.. Additionally, Pushkin required that the first rhyme in each couplet (the A, C, and E rhymes) be unstressed (or \\"feminine\\"), and all others stressed (or \\"masculine\\"). In the rhyme scheme notation capitalizing masculine rhymes, this reads as }}. Not all those using the Onegin stanza have followed the prescription, but both Vikram Seth and Brad Walker notably did so, and the cadence of the unstressed rhymes is an important factor in his manipulations of tone.

Strindberg was a frequent subject for Eldh. Nix, Trollh√§ttan, on the River G√∂ta √§lv Carl Eldh ranks along Carl Milles with the most popular Swedish sculptors of the first half of the 20th Century. Eldh also produced architectural sculpture with renowned Swedish architects, among them Ivar Tengbom, Erik Lallerstedt and Ragnar √ñstberg. √ñstberg designed Eldh's own studio in Bellevue Park, in the north of Stockholm, in 1918. And through √ñstberg, Eldh received the 1923 contract for park sculptures for the Stadshuspark. Adjacent to Stockholm City Hall, between the building and the shore of Lake M√§laren's shore, the park stands with Eldh's ensemble representing the three artists, August Strindberg for Authors, Gustaf Fr√∂ding for Poets, and Ernst Josephson for Painters, as well as Eldh's bronze sculptures \\"S√•ngen\\" and \\"Dansen\\" (\\"The Song\\" and \\"The Dance\\"). The nakedness of the statues initially caused strong protests. Eldh‚Äôs major public works include the grand statue of Strindberg in Stockholm and the Branting Monument, also in Stockholm, which was first executed in plaster around 1930 and completed in 1952. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. The Carl Eldh studio in Bellevue is now a public museum, \\"Carl Eldh Atelj√©museum\\", with two studio rooms stocked from floor to ceiling with drawings, sculptures, tools and other personal belongings. A visit reflects not on the creative activity of an individual sculptor, but allows direct study of his era.

Bernard was the son of Adalais, daughter of William V of Aquitaine and Prisca, and Girard I Trancaleon, whom he succeeded in Armagnac. Prisca was a daughter of William II of Gascony and it was through her that Bernard inherited his Gascon claim. Prisca's claim was passed to her son Odo on the death of her brother Sancho VI in 1032. Bernard was recognised duke in turn on the death of his uncle Odo in 1039, but probably only in the southern regions and not in the region around Bordeaux. Later his title to Gascony was contested by his uncle Guy Geoffrey, younger half-brother of Odo, but not descended from William II. Guy Geoffrey, however, was married to Garsenda, daughter of Aldabert II of P√©rigord and Alausia, the second daughter of the late Sancho VI. Eventually, after a protracted fight, Bernard was defeated at the Battle of La Castelle (fought between Caz√®res and Grenade on the Adour) and had to relinquish Gascony to Guy Geoffrey for 15,000 sous. However, by then the title was almost empty, as most of Gascony had been dismembered and parcelled out as appanages, being in the hand of the counts of B√©arn, Bigorre, Armagnac, Comminges, Astarac. Guy Geoffrey had only conquered a rump Gascony. Bernard fought the archbishop of Auch, partisan of Guy Geoffrey. He abdicated from Gascony before 4 May 1052 and Armagnac by 1061. He may have entered a monastery. In May 1063, he led a rebellion of the Gascon barons against Guy Geoffrey, who had inherited the Duchy of Aquitaine in the meanwhile, but was soundly defeated and Gascony firmly bound to Aquitaine. He disappeared from history, but is not surely dead until 1090.

Toxicophores can act directly (e.g., dioxins) or can require metabolic activation (e.g., tobacco-specific nitrosamines). Most toxic substances exert their toxicity through some interaction (e.g., covalent bonding, oxidation) with cellular macromolecules like proteins or DNA. This interaction leads to changes in the normal cellular biochemistry and physiology and downstream toxic effects. Occasionally, the toxicophore requires bioactivation, mediated by enzymes, to produce a more reactive metabolite that is more toxic. For example, tobacco-specific nitrosamines are activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes to form a more reactive substance that can covalently bind to DNA, causing mutations that, if not repaired, can lead to cancer. Generally, different chemical compounds that contain the same toxicophore elicit similar toxic effects at the same site of toxicity. Medicinal chemists and structural biologists study toxicophores in order to predict (and hopefully avoid) potentially toxic compounds early in the drug development process. Toxicophores can also be identified in lead compounds and removed or replaced later in the process with less toxic moieties. Both techniques, in silico (predictive) and a posteriori (experimental), are active areas of chemoinformatics research and development, within the field known as Computational Toxicology. For example, in the United States, the EPA's National Center for Computational Toxicology sponsors several toxicity databases based on predictive modeling as well as high-throughput screening experimental methods.

Geography Brighton Allston Congregational Church Allston and Brighton's border runs along Everett Street in the north, south along Gordon Street, and terminates at the Brookline town line along Kelton Street (with land to the east of these streets falling in Allston, to the west, Brighton). Allston and Brighton are also identified by their respective postal zip codes (Allston's is 02134, Brighton's is 02135). Allston is generally understood as being in the northeast corner of Allston‚ÄìBrighton, where it meets Brookline and the rest of Boston in the commercialized Union Square or \\"Allston-Village\\" area. Brighton is seen as the larger southwestern portion of Allston‚ÄìBrighton encompassing Brighton Center and the generally less urbanized neighborhoods. They are connected to the Fenway/Kenmore area of Boston by a tiny strip of land containing Boston University along the Charles River, with Brookline lying to the south and southeast, Cambridge to the north and Newton to the west, so they retain a very distinct neighborhood identity together. Allston‚ÄìBrighton is often perceived as being separate from the rest of the city since many urbanized Greater Boston areas such as Cambridge and Somerville are independently governed cities, but it is in fact part of the city of Boston. It is divided by the Massachusetts Turnpike (also known as Interstate 90) into the main southern area and a smaller northern \\"spur\\" separated from Cambridge by the Charles River. History Allston‚ÄìBrighton was formerly an agrarian area known as Little Cambridge. It was incorporated into the city of Boston and received one of the earliest streetcar lines, becoming one of the nation's first streetcar suburbs and home to some of Boston's moderately wealthy classes. Demographics Today the area is a middle-class urbanized area occupied largely by a mix of dense residential neighbourhoods and small businesses. It is home to the New Balance Headquarters, and the WGBH Educational Foundation, operators of radio & television stations WGBH, WGBH- TV, & WGBX-TV; public broadcasters responsible for a large amount of national programming. Students from Boston's many universities are a large demographic in the area, and many residents resent the ongoing expansion of the Boston College and Harvard University campuses . Thanks in large part to students, Brighton Avenue at the heart of Allston has become a major nightlife destination featuring many bars, restaurants, and nightclubs. =Social scene= Allston‚ÄìBrighton is one of Boston's most vibrant neighborhoods . Allston Village, defined by Harvard Avenue, includes an eclectic blend of shops, venues, apartments and people. A Bohemian vibe permeates the community. Diverse influences characterize the temperament of what some locals call Allston Rock City. A mixture of recent immigrants, college students, young professionals and artists adds to the diversity of the environment. Brighton Center, defined by Market and Washington Streets, is Allston's less rambunctious counterpart. Cleveland Circle is dominated by Boston College students. =Local sports= The combined neighborhood supports a youth hockey team, \\"Allston‚ÄìBrighton Youth Hockey\\" which holds most practices at the Reilly Memorial Rink in Cleveland Circle.

At the end of the war he was serving as chief of staff to Assistant Commandant-General C. F. Beyers. Mentz was wounded three times during the war. Start of political career After the war Mentz settled in Pietersburg, where he practised law and when the Transvaal Colony obtained responsible government in 1906 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as a supporter of General Louis Botha. In 1910, with the formation of the Union of South Africa, he became the member of the House of Assembly for Soutpansberg. First World war At the beginning of the First World Warand during the German South West Africa Campaign, Mentz served under Brigadier General M. W. Myburgh, who were among the South African troops that occupied Windhoek. He was appointed military governor of Windhoek by Louis Botha, whereafter his brigade joined the final advance on the north, which culminated in the surrender of the Germans. It was also the end of his military career. Cabinet Minister Mentz was appointed Minister of Lands and Irrigation by Louis Botha in 1915, succeeding Hendrik Schalk Theron. In that capacity he did much to bring about the building of dams, which included the Hartbeespoort Dam and the Darlington Dam in the Sundays River. In 1920 Mentz succeeded General Jan Smuts as Minister of Defence, and in 1921 he attended the Imperial Conference in London. One of the consequences of the Imperial Conference was the abolition of the imperial military command in the Union of South Africa. The South African Naval Service, predecessor of the present South African Navy, was established on 1 April 1922. The Strike Craft of the South African Navy was named after him. Mentz was defeated by Oswald Pirow in the parliamentary election of 1924, and also failed to gain election for the South African Party in 1929, whereafter he had devoted himself to sheep farming and to practising as a solicitor in Pretoria.

Counterterrorism fund Section 101 established a separate and unlimited fund, entitled the \\"Counterterrorism Fund,\\" within the Department of the Treasury. This fund is to be used to reimburse the Department of Justice for costs required to rebuild an office or facility damaged by terrorism, support counterterrorism efforts (including the paying of rewards), and to pay for terrorism threat assessments. It contains an additional provision to reimburse any U.S. department or agency of all costs related to the detention of individuals in foreign countries who are accused of acts of terrorism. The alleged terrorist can be held without the right to an attorney or the right to remain silent. Condemnation of discrimination Section 102 was a general statement which confirmed that Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, and Americans from South Asia play a vital role in the United States, and are as equally entitled to full civil rights as any other American. This section further condemned acts of violence against these people that have occurred since the September 11, 2001 attacks, and stated that the responsibility for the 11 September attack lay solely with the individuals who perpetrated them. It also found that \\"Muslim Americans have become so fearful of harassment that many Muslim women are changing the way they dress to avoid becoming targets\\" and that \\"many Arab Americans and Muslim Americans have acted heroically during the attacks on the United States.\\" The Act specifically mentioned Mohammed Salman Hamdani, a 23-year-old New Yorker of Pakistani descent, which the Act states was believed to have gone to the World Trade Center to offer rescue assistance and was believed to have been killed. This section also reasserted that: # the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans, including Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, and Americans from South Asia, must be protected, and that every effort must be taken to preserve their safety # any acts of violence or discrimination against any Americans must be condemned # the concept of individual responsibility for wrongdoing is sacrosanct in American society, and applies equally to all religious, racial, and ethnic groups; and # the United States is called upon to recognize the patriotism of fellow citizens from all ethnic, racial, and religious backgrounds.

They are often considered as one of the first progressive folk bands with other artists like Nick Drake or groups like Pentangle. Their music mainly consists of their own compositions, based on strong Celtic roots and typically featuring intricate acoustic guitar playing and close harmony singing. In their early years, they toured the folk clubs of the United Kingdom or internationally as a support act for several rock bands. Today, they regularly give concerts, especially in Ireland. From 1971 to 1973, T√≠r na n√ìg made three studio albums which were highly acclaimed by critics but didn't receive a big commercial success. No recording of live performances had been officially released until 2000, with the publication of Hibernian. A compilation of some of their live tracks recorded between 1972 and 1973 for the John Peel's radio show, was also published one year later. Formation of the band Sonny Condell came from Newtownmountkennedy, a remote place in the Wicklow Hills. His early musical influences were mainly classical music. Before T√≠r na n√ìg were formed, he played with cousin John Roberts as Tramcarr 88. They recorded one single before the break-up of the band. Leo O'Kelly came from Carlow. He was influenced by heavy rock, including Jimi Hendrix, The Velvet Underground and The Doors. Before the formation of T√≠r na n√ìg he played in several bands starting with local Carlow beat group The Word before joining The Tropical Showband and Emmet Spiceland, with whom he toured. O'Kelly and Condell met in Dublin in 1969 and discovered a shared ambition to be singer/songwriters. They started playing together, taking the name T√≠r na n√ìg from Celtic mythology, and writing a song of the same name, which recounts the legend of T√≠r na n√ìg. They travelled to London and began touring the folk clubs, and rapidly secured a recording deal with Chrysalis Records. 1971‚Äì1974: performing and recording T√≠r na n√ìg in 1972. From left to right: Leo O'Kelly, Sonny Condell T√≠r na n√ìg made three studio albums between 1971 and 1973. The first was called T√≠r na n√ìg and was produced by Bill Leader. It achieved Melody Maker Album of The Month on its release on May 1971. It featured mainly their own songs, strongly rooted in the Celtic tradition, but also influenced by eastern music. Condell and O'Kelly played acoustic guitars and occasional bongos and other percussion instruments. Their guitar work was intricate and complex, leading to their being compared to bands such as The Incredible String Band and Pentangle. However, their style was quite distinctive. Often, they would use different open tunings for their two guitars. Their second album A Tear and a Smile was released in 1972 and produced by Tony Cox. This featured similar material to the first album. However, with their third album Strong in the Sun (released in 1973), produced by Procol Harum organist Matthew Fisher who also played keyboards on the album, they introduced more electric instruments and drums. From Alan Robinson's 2004 liner notes to BGO's reissue of this and the previous album on one CD: \\"..Certainly, of the three original T√≠r na n√ìg albums, Strong in the Sun is by far the most conventional, most mainstream, although that's not to say that Fisher had ironed out all of the band's entertainingly whimsical rough edges. Fisher gave a bit of a more clearly-defined shape and a greater depth to their sound, neatly framing the duo's contrasting vocal styles.\\" Robinson also remarked that this high quality album didn't \\"reverse the duo's sales fortunes\\" and that it opened with \\"that rarest of things\\", a Nick Drake cover, \\"Free Ride\\". As well as the folk club circuit, T√≠r na n√ìg also toured internationally, as a support act for various rock bands, including Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, The Who and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. In July 1974, the British music magazine, NME, reported that the band was to play their final concert, in Dublin on 27 July that year. The radio presenter, John Peel, promoted their music and they performed a number of live sessions for the BBC. Later years After the break-up of T√≠r na n√ìg in 1974, they both returned to Ireland to pursue solo careers. Condell recorded a solo album called Camouflage in 1977 and went on to form the band Scullion with Philip King, Greg Boland and Jimmy O'Brien Moran. O'Kelly pursued a career as a producer and has also released solo albums. T√≠r na n√ìg reformed in 1985, releasing the single \\"Love Is Like a Violin\\", and have toured sporadically since then. Four albums ‚Äì from various early and later recording dates ‚Äì have followed: In 1999, In The Morning, an album of 15 previously unreleased demos from April 1970 recorded in Dublin, Ireland, was issued by the Kissing Spell record label. Hibernian, released in 2000, is a September 1995 live performance from Birmingham, UK, and Spotlight in 2001, contains original John Peel BBC radio sessions from 1972/1973. In 2010, they launched a new live album, Live at Sirius, recorded at the Sirius Arts Centre in Cobh, Co. Cork on 21/22 August 2009. In 2014, they released a 4-track, 7\\" vinyl EP on Fruits de Mer Records. Alongside three originals, the lead track is a cover of The Silver Apples' \\"I Have Known Love\\". On 24 May 2015, T√≠r na n√ìg released their first studio album since 1973, The Dark Dance. The following year, Mega Dodo records released a Tir na n√ìg live LP.

Associated with Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia and the various lottery companies of the states and territories of Australia, the program featured contestants who were chosen from a draw of scratch-tickets sent in by the...More Show =Overview= At the start of each show, a shot of the contestants going down the famous splash drop at the end of the Wild West Falls Adventure Ride also at Movie World was shown. Three contestants participated in each game. If on any game when the contestant did not win the full $5000, the part of the $5000 that they did not win will be given to a lucky home viewer. For example, if the contestant won $3000, the home viewer will get the other $2000. =Round 1= For the first round, the contestants took turns in picking cards from a board of 15. There are five cards of each colour for each contestant. The first contestant to get five cards of the colour won an amount up to $5,000. The runners up got $500 each. =Round 2= In the second round, three new contestants played Rock, Paper, Scissors. This game is played over nine rounds. In the first round they play for $30 and this amount increases progressively for each round until the final round where it is $2000. If each contestant selected the same item as each other, the round is considered a draw and the cash up for grabs will be added onto the next round. In cases where all three items appear by one of three contestants, it is also a draw. Whenever two players select the item that beats the other player, the two winners will get the amounts up on offer each. If one player beats the other two, they will get double amount they were playing for. At the end of the last round, the player with the highest amount of cash will win that amount of cash up to $5000 and the runners get $500 each regardless of how high their score was. =Round 3= For the third round, the contestants take turns of dropping giant coins into a giant Pachinko machine, which have movable, rotatable parts. Each contestant has three drops each and at the bottom of the Pachinko board there are five pockets, each with a different cash amount each. The amounts increase after each contestant has made a drop. After all contestants have dropped three coins into the machine, the contestant who got the highest cash amount will get to drop another coin. This time each pocket will be given either the word 'WIN' or 'LOSE' randomly. There is a 50-50 chance that the coin will land in a ‚ÄòWIN‚Äô pocket. If the coin lands in a ‚ÄòWIN‚Äô pocket, that player $5000 and the other two players will get $500 each regardless of their score. If however, the coin lands in a ‚ÄòLOSE‚Äô pocket, the person who dropped it will only get $500 and the next highest scorer will win whatever their cash amount was. The lowest scoring player will also get $500 in this case. =Round 4= In the fourth and final round the contestant who won the highest amount of money from the previous rounds will play for $100,000. A lucky home viewer who entered the draw will be randomly selected to play for the $100,000 against the contestant. The contestant on the show will get to pick one of twelve celebrities on a giant screen. Each celebrity conceals a very brief video of themselves. Six celebrities say that contestant in the studio will get to pick first while the other six celebrities will say that the home viewer will go first. The home-viewer is not in the actual studio but will do their selections over the phone. In the second part of this round the contestant and the home viewer took turns in selecting celebrities. One celebrity has a big $100,000 cheque. Another celebrity has a dynamite and the other ten celebrities will reveal $500 if selected, which will be added to a player's prize money. This round ends when either player has selected the person with either the cheque or the dynamite. If the player selects the celebrity who has the cheque, they will instantly win the $100,000. If the player selects the one with the dynamite, their opponent will get the $100,000. If the home player missed out on the $100,000, they got a trip to the Gold Coast. Reception This game show did not rate very well because it lacked the elements such as skills, knowledge, risk taking (unlike the much more successful Deal or No Deal, which also requires a great deal of luck) and variety which makes a gameshow exciting. Winning on this game involves very little else other than luck. Another flaw in this gameshow was the lack of variety; the same games were played at the same time in each show, unlike The Price is Right (the Australian version was also hosted by Larry Emdur), where there were dozens of games that seemed to appear randomly on each show.

His work as a composer, music educator and scholar of Mexican music connected the concert scene with a mostly forgotten tradition of popular song and Mexican folklore. Many of his compositions are strongly influenced by the harmonies and form of traditional songs.  Biography  = Early years = Born in Fresnillo, Zacatecas, Manuel Maria Ponce moved with his family to the city of Aguascalientes only a few weeks after his birth and lived there until he was 15 years old. He was famous for being a musical prodigy; according to his biographers, he was barely four years of age when, after having listened to the piano classes received by his sister, Josefina, he sat in front of the instrument and interpreted one of the pieces that he had heard. Immediately, his parents had him receive classes in piano and musical notation. = Traveling years = In 1901 Ponce entered the National Conservatory of Music, already with a certain prestige as a pianist and composer. There he remained until 1903, the year in which he returned to the city of Aguascalientes. This was only the beginning of his travels. In 1904 he traveled to Italy for advanced musical studies at the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna. He studied in Germany as a pupil of Martin Krause at the Stern conservatory in Berlin between 1906 and 1908. = Years at the National Conservatory = thumbright250pxThis sculpture is behind the Exedra, the Plaza de la Patria de Aguascalientes, and is similar to the sculpture of the grave of the composer in the Rotunda of Illustrious Men. After his years abroad, Ponce returned to Mexico to teach piano and music history at the National Conservatory of Music from 1909 to 1915 and from 1917 to 1922. He spent the intervening years of 1915 to 1917 in Havana, Cuba. In 1912 he composed his most famous work \\"Estrellita\\" (little star), which is not a normal love song, as is usually thought, but \\"Nostalgia Viva\\" (live nostalgia). That same year, Ponce gave in the \\"Arbeau Theater\\" a memorable concert of Mexican popular music which, though it scandalized ardent defenders of European classical music, became a landmark in the history of the national song. Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887‚Äì1959), who met Ponce in Paris in the 1920s, wrote With valuable activity promoting music of the country and writing melod√≠as like \\"Estrellita\\", \\"A la orilla de un palmar\\", \\"Alev√°ntate\\", \\"La Pajarera\\", \\"Marchita el Alma\\" and \\"Una Multitud M√°s\\", Ponce gained the honorific title Creator of the Modern Mexican Song. He was also the first Mexican composer to project popular music onto the world stage: \\"Estrellita\\", for example, has been part of the repertoire of the main orchestras of the world and countless singers, although quite often the interpreter ignores the origin of the song as well as its author. In 1947 he received the National Science and Arts Prize. He was married to Clementina Maurel, next to whom he died in Mexico City. His body was buried in the Roundhouse of the Illustrious Men in the Pantheon of Dolores in Mexico City. In his honor there is a board of recognition by the state of Aguascalientes at the base of the column of The Exedra, next to the fountain from a spring dedicated to this musical poet, in the city of Aguascalientes where he grew up and first studied music. = Recordings by Ponce = Ponce participated in the following recordings: *Manuel Mar√≠a Ponce: Concierto para piano y orquesta (Ponce on piano; Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de M√©xico; conducted by Carlos Ch√°vez) (Radio Mil, 1942) Las muchas lecturas de una grabaci√≥n sonora by Eduardo Contreras SotoDos grabaciones hist√≥ricas y algunos de sus valores: Revueltas y Ponce by Eduardo Contreras Soto Ponce recorded the following works on Duo-Art piano rolls between 1916 and 1920:Duo-Art Piano Roll Catalog Mechanical Music Digest *5789 Ponce - Mexican Barcarolle *5807 Ponce - Cuban Serenade *5924 Ponce - Mexican Serenade *5930 Ponce - Moonlight *5937 Ponce - Sono mi Mente-Loca (Cuban Song) *6294 Ponce - Quando vene la Primavera (When Spring Comes) Music Ponce wrote music for solo instruments, chamber ensembles, and orchestra. His piano and guitar works outnumber those dedicated to other solo instruments within the set of pieces we know. Estrellita is Ponce's best known work. = Guitar music = Ponce's guitar music is a core part of the instrument's repertory, the best-known works being Variations and Fugue on 'La Folia' (1929) and Sonatina meridional (1939). He also wrote a guitar concerto Concierto del sur, which is dedicated to his long-time friend and guitar virtuoso Andr√©s Segovia. His last known work dedicated to Father Antonio Brambila, Variations on a Theme of Cabez√≥n, was written in 1948, a few months before his death. It is unclear whether the variations are indeed based upon a theme by Antonio de Cabez√≥n or if the theme was the work of Ponce's teacher, the organist Enrico Bossi. The following is only a select number of his most significant contributions. *Scherzino Mexicano (1909) (originally written for piano) *24 Preludes *Canciones populares mexicanas: La pajarera, Por ti mi coraz√≥n, La valentina (ca. 1925‚Äì1926) *Sonata mexicana (1923) *Th√®me vari√© et Finale (1926) *Sonata No. 3 (1927) *Sonata cl√°sica (1928) *Sonata rom√°ntica (1929) *Suite in A minor (1929) *Cuatro Piezas, including Mazurka and Valse *Variations and Fugue on 'La Folia' (1929) *Valse (1937) *Sonatina meridional (1939) *Variations on a Theme of Cabez√≥n (1948) *Dos Vinetas (posthumous) It was Ponce who anonymously created the striking arrangement for guitar of J. S. Bach's Prelude from the first cello suite as performed and recorded by Segovia. Ponce also composed a \\"Sonata for Guitar and Harpsichord.\\" Segovia ascribed the Sonata's prelude to lutenist/Bach contemporary S. L. Weiss.

Most of them were finally donated to the National School of Music (UNAM) in Mexico City, as an analytic catalogue of his works could still be published. One of Ponce's melodies still heard today in various arrangements is \\"Estrellita\\" (1912). References Sources *Coraz√≥n Otero: Manuel M. Ponce y la guitarra, Mexico 1980.

In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, Lutheranism, Methodism and Anglicanism, an altar or sanctus bell is typically a small hand-held bell or set of bells. The primary reason for the use of such bells is to create a joyful noise to the Lord as a way to give thanks for the miracle taking place atop the altar.Herrera, Matthew D.Sanctus Bells: Their History and Use in the Catholic Church. San Luis Obispo: Tixlini Scriptorium, 2004 An ancillary function of the bells is to focus the attention of those attending the Mass that a supernatural event is taking place on the altar. Such bells are also commonly referred to as the Mass bell, sacring bell, Sacryn bell, saints' bell, sance-bell, or sanctus bell (or \\"bells\\", when there are two or more). and are kept on the credence table or some other convenient location within the sanctuary. Use in the Catholic Church =Use at Mass= \\"A little before the Consecration, if appropriate, a minister rings a small bell as a signal to the faithful.\\"General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 150 Dennis Chester Smolarski, \\"The General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 1969-2002: A Commentary\\" (), pp. 20-21 The usual moment chosen for giving the signal of the approach of the Consecration is when the priest stretches out his hands over the host and the chalice while reciting the epiclesis. Mention of this signal was introduced into the Roman Missal in Pope John XXIII's 1962 revision.Minister paulo ante Consecrationem campanulae signo fideles moneat (Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, VIII, 6 in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, but not in earlier editions) Even before 1962 it was common practice to give this signal, although it then \\"ha[d] no authority\\".Adrian Fortescue, Canon of the Mass, in Catholic Encyclopedia All pre-1970 editions of the Roman Missal, including that of 1962, prescribe continuous ringing of the altar bell while the priest recites the words of the Sanctus at Low Mass.Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, VII, 8 but, in line with its abolition of a hard and fast distinction between sung and merely spoken Mass, the 1970 edition makes no mention of that practice. According to local custom, the server also rings the bell as the priest shows the host and then the chalice Pre-1970 editions of the Roman Missal prescribe either a triple or a continuous ringing of the bell at each showing of the consecrated elements.Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, VIII, 6 Pre-1962 editions also prescribe that the server should first light a torch, to be extinguished only after the priest has consumed the chalice or has given Communion to any others who are to receive the Eucharist.Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, VIII, 6 in pre-1962 editions of the Roman Missal On 10 September 1898, the Congregation of Sacred Rites declared inappropriate the use of a gong instead of the altar bell. The ringing of an altar bell began probably in the 13th century.Bells at the Consecration It is not mentioned in the original 1570 Roman Missal of Pope Pius VMissale Romanum. Editio Princeps (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1998 ) and was not introduced into papal Masses until the time of Pope John Paul II. When, before the reintroduction of concelebration, priests frequently said Mass at a side altar while a public celebration was taking place at a nearby altar, the Congregation of Sacred Rites found it necessary to issue a prohibition against ringing a bell at the Mass celebrated at the side altar.Decree of 31 Aigist 1967 The same rule was made even for a Solemn Mass celebrated at an altar other than that at which the Blessed Sacrament is publicly exposed, and allowed the ringing of the altar bell to be omitted when Mass was celebrated at the altar of exposition.Gardellini, Instr. Clem., nos. 16, 4, 5 Like all church bells, the altar bell is not rung from the end of the Gloria in excelsis at the Mass of the Lord's Supper until the beginning of the Gloria in excelsis at the Easter Vigil. During this interval a clapper (crotalus/matraca, in Latin, Crotalum, Crepitaculum) is sometimes used in place of the altar bell. In a few places there is a local custom, not mandated by liturgical law, of not using altar bells during the season of Advent and of then ringing them throughout the Gloria at Christmas Midnight Mass to celebrate the resumption of their use.Edward McNamara, \\"Substituting Bells in Advent\\" =Benediction= An altar bell used in a Catholic church in Florida. Bells may also be rung during Eucharistic adoration and benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. Lutheran use In branches of Lutheranism, altar bells are rung at the two appropriate times during the Words of Institution (\\"This is my body... This is the cup of my blood...\\") to signify the real presence.Altar Guild and Sacristy Handbook by S. Anita Stauffer (Augsburg Fortress) Anglican use An altar gong and mallet, used as an alternative to the altar bell in some churches (especially in Anglo-Catholicism). Some Anglican parishes, in particular those that are Anglo-Catholic, use an altar bell which is rung to signify the Real Presence of Christ in the sacred Elements. During the Eucharist, it is usually rung three times - once before the Words of Institution, and once at each elevation of the Host and of the Chalice. It may also be rung to indicate the time that the faithful may come forward to receive Communion. The bells are also rung when the monstrance or ciborium is exposed or processed, for example when moving the reserved Sacrament from a side altar to the high altar. Custom differs concerning its use at Low Mass, or during Lent and Holy Week. In some churches, particularly in the Anglo-Catholic tradition, a large (and sometimes decorated) gong, struck with a mallet, may be used during the celebration of mass as an alternative to the altar bell. Other Protestant use In some Methodist churches, particularly the United Methodist Church of the United States, altar bells are used two different times during common services held on Sundays. The Chimes of the Trinity are rung by an acolyte before the prelude of the service and at the end of the benediction. The Chimes of the Trinity is the ringing of the bell three times to represent the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Basic policies generally only cover emergency medical expenses while overseas, while comprehensive policies typically include coverage for trip cancellation, lost luggage, flight delays, public liability, and other expenses. Policy purchase = Cost calculation = Travel insurance, are risk-based, and take into account a range of factors to determine whether a traveller can purchase a policy and what the premium will be. This generally includes destination countries or regions, the duration of the trip, the age of the travellers, and any optional benefits that they require coverage for such as pre-existing medical conditions, adventure sports, rental vehicle excess, cruising, or high-value electronics. Some policies will also take into account the traveller's estimated value of their trip to determine price. A policy may be a single trip, covering the exact duration of the upcoming trip, or a \\"multi-trip\\" policy can cover an unlimited number of trips of limited duration within a year. = Journey departure and return conditions = Most travel insurance policies must be purchased prior to departure from home, or from the first departure point (e.g. an airport), depending on the product. A smaller number of brands offer travel insurance for travellers who are already overseas and have forgotten to purchase travel insurance or have a policy which has expired. Most policies require you to start and finish your journey in your country of residence, however some policies offer coverage for one-way travel for people who are permanently relocating to another country. = Complimentary travel insurance = Some credit card issuers offer automatic travel insurance if travel arrangements are paid for using their credit cards, but these policies are generic and do not take into account personal requirements and circumstances. Common benefits = Medical = In the event of minor injury or illness overseas, medical benefits offer coverage for visits to general practitioners, medicine, ambulance fees, and limited dentistry benefits. In the event of hospitalisation, most travel insurance policies include emergency assistance services, which can offer guarantees of payment to hospitals for treatment, liaise treating doctors, and organise transfers between hospitals or medical evacuations back to the insured person's country of origin. More comprehensive policies include an emergency companion cover, so that a family member can remain with the insured person while in hospital. In the event of death overseas, medical benefit sections typically include cover for repatriation of remains to insured person's the country of origin, or a funeral overseas. = Cancellation = Comprehensive travel insurance policies include cover for any cancellation fees or lost deposits relating to cancellation of the insured's person's trip for a range of unforeseen and unexpected circumstances. These include illness or injury, natural disasters and bad weather, strikes and riots, hijacking, and family emergencies. Depending on the policy, it may also include cancellation due to jury service, being made redundant from full-time employment, having your annual leave revoked if you are in the armed forces or emergency services, and prohibition of or advisory against travel by a government to a particular destination. = Alternative transport and travel expenses = Many policies include benefits for alternative transport, accommodation, and meal expenses if your transport provider is delayed by a certain period, provided any layover times met the criteria in the policy. Policies may also include a benefit to purchase essential items like clothing and toiletries in the event baggage is delayed by an airline. = Luggage = Luggage benefits cover for loss, damage or theft of personal effects during your journey, including passports and other travel documents. It may also include limited benefits for theft of cash. = Public liability = This covers legal liability as a result of a claim made against you for bodily injuries or damage to property of other persons. Optional benefits In addition to their base policies, many providers offer coverage for declared pre-existing conditions (e.g. asthma, diabetes, cancer), higher risk sports and activities (e.g. skiing, trekking at high altitudes, scuba diving), rental car damage, and cruising. Common exclusions Insurance companies issuing will often exclude coverage for ongoing known events to new policies, and may announce long-term exclusions for specific events, such as volcanic activity from a currently active volcano. As travel insurance is a risk-based product, many policies will exclude events which may be of a far-reaching and poorly quantified risk, such as pandemics and endemics, acts of war, and terrorism. Some policies exclude travel to certain countries, or parts of countries, where a greater risk is expected. These determinations are often made based on official government travel advice from organisations such as the US State Department or the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs. Other common exclusions in travel insurance policies include undeclared pre-existing medical conditions, unlicensed operation of a motorcycle, travelling for the purpose of receiving medical treatment, elective surgery or treatment, or injury or illness caused by alcohol, drug use, or reckless behaviour. Compulsory travel insurance Certain countries require foreign visitors have proof of sufficient travel insurance as a condition for granting a visa or of approving visa-free entry. This includes travellers applying for a Schengen Area or UAE visa, and all visitors to Cuba, Turkey and Belarus. Thailand and Egypt have announced plans to introduce similar requirements. Tour companies and cruise providers may also require passengers possess a minimum level of travel insurance before the traveller can commence their journey.

The album was a commercial success for Thompson, and featured his biggest American hit single \\"I Feel So Good\\", as well as the fan favourite \\"1952 Vincent Black Lightning‚Äù. The album earned Thompson a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1992. It was voted number 665 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). Songs The American spelling of the word \\"Rumor\\" is due to the fact that Thompson took the title of his album from a posthumously published poem by Archibald MacLeish: \\"Rumor and sigh of unimagined seas/ Dim radiance of stars that never flamed.\\" Patrick Humphries described the central character of the song \\"I Feel So Good\\" as a ne'er do well who has been freed from prison and expresses his \\"bullying exultation at his freedom. In an interview, Thompson explained, \\"If you make someone the subject of a song you're almost inevitably making him a hero. But he obviously isn't. Nor is he an anti-hero. He's no worse than the society that created him. It's a very twentieth century moral dilemma.\\"Humphries, 1996, Richard Thompson: Strange Affair, p.275 \\"Grey Walls\\" was inspired by Colney Hatch Mental Hospital in Barnet, North London, which Thompson passed on the bus as a teenager. The song describes the disturbing effect of ECT on psychiatric patients. Thompson has also called the song a comment on the effects of Thatcherism‚Äîin the context of closing down mental institutions and selling the facilities for profit. Thompson has said he was inspired to write \\"Don't Sit On My Jimmy Shands\\" after hearing a story of Bob Dylan at a party, hogging the record player so he could play only Robert Johnson recordings. Thompson planned his song as a tongue in cheek tribute to Jimmy Shand, Scottish musician who achieved popularity in the 1930s and 40s by arranging traditional Scottish songs for his accordion band. Shand's music loomed large in Thompson's childhood. Thompson wrote \\"Mother Knows Best\\" to mark the resignation of Margaret Thatcher and express his feelings about the departed Conservative Prime Minister: \\"She says 'Bring me your first-born. And I'll suck their blood/ Bring me your poor/ I can trample in the mud'.\\" Humphries, 1996, Richard Thompson: Strange Affair, p.276 Although a teetotaller,Humphries, 1996, Richard Thompson: Strange Affair, p.277Thompson wrote \\"God Loves A Drunk\\" to suggest that alcoholism can be a path to spiritual ecstasy. He has described the song as \\"a swipe at Mormons and Seventh Day Adventists, those people with the polyester suits, those people who are very clean and neat, which means they must be alright with God.\\" The track \\"1952 Vincent Black Lightning,\\" despite not being issued as a single, became a fan favourite and is one of Thompson's most highly acclaimed solo compositions. In 2011 Time magazine listed the song in its \\"All TIME 100 Songs\\", a list of \\"the most extraordinary English-language popular recordings since the beginning of TIME magazine in 1923.\\"\\"All-TIME 100 Songs: 1952 Vincent Black Lightning\\" (retrieved on Feb. 26, 2014).

Two videos, for \\"I Feel So Good\\" (animation inspired by the cover artwork) and album track \\"I Misunderstood\\" were produced to promote the album.

Abandoned by her novelist father Gilbert Frankau at an early age, she soon became a prolific writer herself. She stopped writing for a decade after the death of her lover, the poet Humbert Wolfe, in 1940. After serving in World War II, she was married for several years to an American naval officer, but returned to England and resumed her writing career. Early life and career Frankau was born in London, the younger daughter of Dorothea Frances Markham Drummond- Black and the novelist Gilbert Frankau. Her grandmother was the satirist Julia Frankau, one of several famous siblings, and her uncle was the British radio comedian, Ronald Frankau. Never attentive to his two daughters, her father abandoned the family for another woman in 1919, Frankau and her elder sister, Ursula, were sent as boarders to Burgess Hill Girls (previously named \\"Burgess Hill School for Girls\\"), Sussex, until 1924. Frankau wrote about this period in her autobiographical novel I Find Four People (1935). She had success as a writer from a young age. Her first novel, Marriage of Harlequin (1927), was written at age 19 and well received by critics. Over the next dozen years, she published 20 novels. She had a long but stormy friendship with the author and journalist Dame Rebecca West. A long relationship with the married poet Humbert Wolfe ended only with his death in 1940. Frankau then ceased to write for almost ten years. During the Second World War, she worked for the BBC, the Ministry of Food and then with the Auxiliary Territorial Service, where she began a lesbian affair with fellow officer Marjorie Vernon Whitefoord, who sponsored Frankau's conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1942. In 1945, she married Marshall Dill Jr (1916 ‚Äì 2000), a former American naval intelligence officer. After the war Dill Jr became a University history professor. They resided in California, USA. In 1946 their only child, Anthony Marshall Dill died in infancy resulting from complications due to premature birth. The couple divorced in 1951 and Frankau later returned to London, England. Later years Frankau published her most successful novel, The Willow Cabin in 1949, which was based partly on the experience of her love for Wolfe, and her following novels were widely read. First published in 1954, A Wreath for the Enemy is perhaps her most enduring novel and is still in print on both sides of the Atlantic. In the novel the events of one night transform what appears at first to be a typical adolescent crisis into a prolonged struggle for self- definition on the part of the novel's teenage protagonist. In part autobiographical, Frankau clearly identified with her lead character who is presented as a writer in development. A long and happy lesbian relationship with the theatre director Margaret Webster began in the mid-1950s. The couple divided their time between residences in Hampstead, London, France and Aquinnah, Martha's Vineyard, MA, USA.Barranger, Milly S. Margaret Webster: a life in the theater, University of Michigan Press, 2004 She wrote of her distant relationship with her father in Pen to Paper (1961). In a response to a questionnaire for the book Authors Take Sides on Vietnam, Frankau stated \\"I am against the war in Vietnam because I am against all wars, no matter how, where or why they are fought\\".Cecil Woolf and John Bagguley,Authors take sides on Vietnam : two questions on the war in Vietnam answered by the authors of several nations London : Peter Owen, (p.108). In 1962 Frankau was diagnosed with breast cancer with a poor prognosis due to the remedial cancer treatments available at the time. After a 5 year battle with the disease, Frankau died aged 59 at the Hampstead, London home she had shared with Margaret Webster. She was buried in a Catholic service in Hampstead Cemetery. Margaret Webster dedicated her first autobiography \\"The Same, Only Different: Five Generations of a Great Theatre Family\\" (1969) in Frankau memory. Frankau's final novel 'Colonel Blessington' was edited by her cousin, the writer Diana Raymond and posthumously published in 1968.

It was portrayed the lives and loves of ten singles who lived in an upmarket apartment building in Auckland, New Zealand. The show was touted as New Zealand's answer to Melrose Place.City Life TV Show - City Life Television Show - TV.com The show starred Claudia Black, Lisa Chappell, Laurie Foell and Oliver Driver and featured a guest appearance by well known New Zealand actor, Kevin Smith. The show had a long development period, and the original treatment for the show had it set in Wellington with the working title 96 Oriental Parade. However, it was decided to produce the show in Auckland instead, and as such, the shows setting was changed along with the name to City Life. The first episode began with a controversial first scene, featuring a drunken Damon (Kevin Smith) who owned the apartment building, in a homosexual kiss with his former lover Ryan on the night before his wedding. Damon was later killed off in the same episode after being hit by a car on the way to his wedding, and he left his apartment building to all of his friends. However, Damon's fiance√® vowed to fight for her share of Damon's estate, leading to a storyline that would span the show's first five episodes. The show initially rated well but executives were somewhat alarmed by a major drop in the show's audience in the first five minutes of the first episode (believed to be the result of the kiss between Damon and Ryan). Within weeks ratings had dropped to the point where the show was placed in a later timeslot. A few weeks later, the show was taken off air entirely, after ten episodes had been screened. The show was not brought back until late 1997, and the remaining episodes were screened until the beginning of 1998. In total, 26 hour-long episodes were produced. In January 2007, the series was rerun on the TVNZ channel TV2 during the early weekday mornings. The show has been replayed on TVNZ Heartland. Cast and characters *Claudia Black as Angela Kostapas: A corporate lawyer, who later quits her cushy position and tries her hand at legal aid. She shares a past with Aaron (they had an affair and she ended up aborting his baby) and is accidentally responsible for the death of Damon South (Kevin Smith) in the first episode. *Jack Campbell as Aaron Kellett: Despite being a member of the wealthy Kellett family, Aaron is a somewhat shady character who shares a past with Angela. Aaron has made a career for himself in event management, organising dance parties and other similar events. During the course of the series he becomes involved with drug dealing. *Katrina Browne as Kristen Wood: A somewhat ditzy university student, Kristen considers herself to be a slacker and indulges herself by spending copious amounts of time on the internet discussing conspiracy theories. While this makes Kristen a nerd in the eyes of some, she is also spectacularly beautiful, a fact that Kristen seems totally unaware of. Kristen finally forms a relationship with her best friend Josh and loses her virginity to him after seemingly being frigid and uninterested in men throughout the series. *Lisa Chappell as Bronwyn Kellett: Aaron's spoilt sister who runs an art gallery. Her privileged Pakeha views often clash with Wiki's Maori sensibilities, though the two are usually close friends. *Oliver Driver as Josh Gribble: An aspiring comedian. As one would expect, Josh is often the source of humour for the series and is best known for his sarcastic one liners. Josh develops a crush on his best friend Kristen, which eventually leads to a relationship. *Laurie Foell as Stephanie Cox: A former children's television presenter who longs to become a serious journalist. She is estranged from her parents as her father pimped her out to one of his friends when she was a teenager. This experience has affected her relationships with men. *John Freeman as Gideon Miller: An economist who used to work for the New Zealand treasury. He is known to his friends for his habit of one-night stands, but falls deeply in love with Siobhan (Rachel Blakely), a drug addict early in the series. *Michelle Huirama as Wiki Taylor: An aspiring actress. Her ambition to become famous often leads her into sticky situations, most notably when she is raped while filming a love scene for a movie. *Charles Mesure as Ryan Waters: A gay bartender, who begins the series in love with Damon South. Later on he agrees to donate sperm to his boss Mia (played by Donogh Rees), whose husband can't have children. Ryan has a habit of falling for men who do not return the same level of affection, such as his best friend Damon South and later Michael Lee (Kenneth Moraleda). *Peter Muller as Hugh Campbell: A photographer who has the unfortunate curse of being unlucky in love, having a few disastrous flings over the course of the series.

Its exact location is not known for certain, but it must be in the lowlands. Ptolemy places the mouth of the Vidrus next to the mouth of the Rhine. Next in order follows a port, Marnamanis, and then the mouth of the Amisius, or Ems. The next river in that direction is the Visurgis, which has to be the Weser River. Ptolemy said that the Rhine had three mouths, one of which was in the \\"west\\". It has been proposed that this might have meant the mouth of the IJssel, which today flows from the Rhine near Arnhem. But it did not originally connect to the Rhine, the Romans themselves, under the command of Drusus, joined the two with a canal. Both the Vecht and the IJssel flowed to the IJsselmeer, formerly the Zuiderzee, which one Roman source (Pomponius Mela) called Flevus Lacus. The Romans were able to send fleets of ships into the Lakes and from there to access the Ems. Another older connection from the Rhine to the lakes was the Vecht. Although the Romans apparently did not consider it navigable, it possibly gave access to the old IJ, and from there to Velsen where there was a Roman fortification on the coast, apparently the same one which Tacitus referred to as Flevus. Most scholars (including Smith, Van der Aa, Bruijnesteijn and Anthon) equate the Vecht and the Vidrus. Ortelius says that the Vidrus was the old name for the Regge, a tributary of the Vecht. Etymologically Vidrus is close to Indo- European *wod-or, which becomes Germanic *watar by Grimm's Law.

Its members and affiliates are agencies with a demonstrable interest in the quality assurance of higher education accreditation.  Activities  In 2003, the Ministers of the Bologna process asked ENQA to elaborate \\"an agreed set of standards, procedures and guidelines\\" for higher education. The task was completed and European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance (ESG) was adopted by the Bologna Process Ministers in 2005. and was revised in 2015. In April 2015, the Malaysian Minister for Education was among those seeking greater cooperation between universities in Europe and Asia to help improve quality of education, student mobility and ultimately the employability of graduates. An article in September 2015 stated that ENQA, in conjunction with the British Accreditation Council, introduced an accreditation scheme for any independent UK or overseas university that wishes to gain accreditation from the British Accreditation Council. Paul Fear, CEO of the British Accreditation Council was quoted in the article stating \\"This scheme brings the two agencies together, so it doesn't matter if you're in the UK or if you're overseas, it‚Äôll still be accredited as the same scheme.\\" = EQAR = ENQA worked with the other \\"E4\\" agencies, the European University Association (EUA), the European Association of Institutions in Higher Education (EURASHE) and the European Students Union (ESU), to establish the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education (EQAR), which makes available a validated list of higher education quality assurance agencies which adhere to the ESG, and reduces the risk of bodies which purport to grant accreditation without rigorous review. EQAR is composed of the founding E4 bodies, government members (any state which is part of the Bologna Process may join) and social partners, and governed by an elected Executive Board.

Characteristics Binding generally refers to a mapping of one thing to another. In the context of software libraries, bindings are wrapper libraries that bridge two programming languages, so that a library written for one language can be used in another language. Many software libraries are written in system programming languages such as C or C++. To use such libraries from another language, usually of higher-level, such as Java, Common Lisp, Scheme, Python, or Lua, a binding to the library must be created in that language, possibly requiring recompiling the language's code, depending on the amount of modification needed. However, most languages offer a foreign function interface, such as Python's and OCaml's \`ctypes\`, and Embeddable Common Lisp's \`cffi\` and \`uffi\`. For example, Python bindings are used when an extant C library, written for some purpose, is to be used from Python. Another example is \`libsvn\` which is written in C to provide an API to access the Subversion software repository. To access Subversion from within Java code, \`libsvnjavahl\` can be used, which depends on \`libsvn\` being installed and acts as a bridge between the language Java and \`libsvn\`, thus providing an API that invokes functions from \`libsvn\` to do the work. Major motives to create library bindings include software reuse, to reduce reimplementing a library in several languages, and the difficulty of implementing some algorithms efficiently in some high-level languages.

It was a distinctive blend of radical politics and coverage of the increasingly exciting Manchester youth culture scene of the early 1980s, coinciding with the rise of Factory Records and The Ha√ßienda. History The magazine was started by a small group of former Manchester University students, Ed Glinert, Chris Paul and Andy Spinoza, on a shoestring budget in a run-down building in Portland Street in the city centre. When launched in 1983, the magazine was in a strong tradition of 'alternative' Manchester publications which included (in reverse chronology), City Fun, Manchester Flash, New Manchester Review and Mole Express, all of whose approach was to publish political and cultural content not reflected in the mainstream media of the city. Despite City Life's shoestring beginnings, it developed rapidly in professionalism and grew in prominence and influence in Manchester and beyond. Its life can be divided into two distinct periods, the first being the period 1983-89 when it was run as a workers' co-operative which grew from the initial founding trio to 16 staff at its peak. There is a consensus that this 'independent' period was when the title had a rawer and radical edge than under its later ownership. Its political stories caused consternation and complaints - there were numerous spats with councils, quangos and occasionally blank spaces where legal injunctions had caused stories to be pulled just prior to printing. Similarly, its arts writing can be seen as a vibrant record of a ground-level cultural renaissance taking place with the opening of new facilities as the Hacienda (1982), the Green Room performance venue (1984) and the Cornerhouse visual arts centre (1985); this upsurge was typified by the imaginative re- using of old and vacant city centre buildings for arts and leisure, and can be seen as a key building block of what was later hailed as the physical regeneration of Manchester city centre through widespread commercial investment and property development. =Acquisition by Guardian Media Group= In 1989, it was bought by the Guardian Media Group (GMG), publishers of The Guardian and The Manchester Evening News. GMG changed the style of the magazine, focusing more on listings and interviews, and branching out into publishing guide books and sponsoring events such as the City Life Food and Drink Festival and the City Life Comedian of the Year competition. City Life formed a loose association in 1984/5 with some other regional listings magazines including Due South Magazine (Southampton), Venue (Bristol), Coaster (Bournemouth), and The List (Glasgow and Edinburgh). Of these only Venue and The List survive, having been continually published since 1982 and 1985 respectively. In November 2005 it was announced that City Life was to end publication, with the final edition published on 7 December. =Supplement= City Life now lives on as a 20-page supplement every Friday within the Manchester Evening News and continues to be the most read Whats On guide on the North of England (333k readers.

Water-quality crisis  In late October and early November 2005, over 800 members of the First Nation were evacuated after E. coli bacteria were discovered in their water supply system. The First Nation had been under a boil-water advisory for two years. The drinking water was supplied by a relatively new treatment plant built in March 1998. The cause of the tainted water was found to be a plugged chlorine injector which was not discovered by local operators who had not been adequately trained to run the treatment plant. When officials arrived and fixed the problem, chlorine levels were around 1.7 mg/l. In 2001, the Ontario Clean Water Agency conducted a survey, funded by the federal ministry of Indian and Northern Affairs and the Ontario First Nations Technical Services Corporation, of water systems on Indian reserves in the province. The survey identified 62 communities in the province, including Kashechewan, where severe problems affected the communities' water systems. These problems included broken treatment plant equipment, malfunctioning safety alarms, funding shortages, water sampling deficiencies and a shortage of trained water treatment plant staff. To date, little if any action has been taken on the report's recommendations. In 2003, a report by the same agency described the situation in Kashechewan as \\"a Walkerton-in-waiting\\".\\"Concerns over water on reserve ignored for years\\", CTV News, October 27, 2005.

Doctors flown into the community by Health Canada found 26 people, mostly children, with skin conditions; the patients were diagnosed variously with scabies, mild impetigo and, most commonly, eczema.

He was also a founder of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Baker was a member of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and served as head of the Quaker Peace and Social Witness, an organization of Quakers in Britain working to promote and practise the Quaker testimonies of peace, equality, simplicity and truth. His resting place is the Quaker Meeting House in Maldon, Essex, England where he attended Meeting For Worship on a Sunday. The Meeting is still active today. Life and career A pacifist, Baker was registered as a conscientious objector during World War II. His description of justifying this to his tribunal remains in the current (Fifth) edition of British Yearly Meeting's Quaker Faith and Practice.Baker, E. (1941) Letter to Josiah Knight quoted in Quaker Faith and Practice. (Fifth ed.) Retrieved 29 September 2020 During the war, Baker worked on the \\"Famine Relief\\" campaign, raising funds to send food to the war-torn European continent, educate the British public, and pressure the government. From 1946 to 1948 he was appointed as a joint secretary of the Quaker Centre in Delhi, India, with his wife Joyce. Baker was general secretary of the National Peace Council from 1954 to 1959. In this role he wrote an article entitled 'Psychological warfare a challenge to democracy', and a policy statement on a 'Campaign to secure international agreement on the prohibition of nuclear weapons', in December 1959. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Baker made four peace missions to Cyprus on behalf of the Friends Peace & International Affairs Committee (now part of Quaker Peace and Social Witness),The Friend (2004) Cyprus: Long Division writing about the peace settlement thereBaker, E. (1959) The Settlement in Cyprus. The Political Quarterly, Vol 30(3) p244 While working on the Cyprus issue Baker became a friend of Peter Benenson, the primary founder of Amnesty International (AI). They discussed political, ethical and religious issues. Benenson described Baker as \\"a partner in the launching of the project\\"Benenson, P. (1983). Memoir and together they directed the 'Appeal for Amnesty 1961', speaking almost daily on the phone, jointly corresponding with politicians, churches and the media, and gathering a small number of other supporters. Their shared ideas were often written down on napkins in bars, and influenced the 1961 Observer article by Benenson which initially attracted worldwide publicity to the cause. Baker assisted Benenson with both the research and shaping of Benenson's book called persecution ‚Äô61, which listed case-studies of current political prisoners. Benenson noted that without Baker's work it would not have been achieved.Buchanan, T. (2002) The Truth Will Set You Free': The Making of Amnesty International. Journal of Contemporary History 37(4) pp. 575-597 It was at Baker's suggestion that the now-famous term 'prisoner of conscience' was adopted and became central to Amnesty International, as did Baker's view that they should support those who were not themselves advocating or condoning violence. Baker subsequently explained his view that AI represented the response of men and women ‚Äòwho are tired of the polarized thinking which is the result of the Cold War and similar conflicts but who are deeply concerned with those who are suffering simply because they are suffering.‚Äô Baker became secretary general of AI in 1966. The organisation was in something of a crisis as a result of Benenson's resignation as president, originating in his concerns that AI activities critical of the British Government were being suppressed and his wish to move the organisation headquarters to Switzerland. The position of president was abolished, and Eric Baker was chosen as secretary general. It is reported that Baker faced a formidable task, with morale at its lowest and distrust in the London office running high, and that he had to reestablish AI's stability and sense of purpose. By July 1968, when Martin Ennals was appointed secretary general, the number of AI groups was growing again, and more than a tenth of the prisoners of conscience the group adopted were freedFunding Universe Amnesty International Company History derived from International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 50. St. James Press, 2003. Retrieved 2 January 2006 Baker also became Chairman of the British section of Amnesty International, Vice Chairman of the International Executive Committee of Amnesty, and Chairman of Amnesty's Sub-committee for the Abolition of Torture. Baker continued his peace activism in the context of the Religious Society of Friends. He organised sessions on political prisoners and torture at the 1974 Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in Britain and at the Triennial Meeting of the Friends World Committee for Consultation in 1976, resulting in agreed statements calling for activism to end the use of torture References External links *Amnesty International (AI) Timeline 1960s *Article on the history of AI in Agni from Boston University *History article from the Estonian division of AI Category:1920 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Amnesty International people Category:British Quakers Category:British activists Category:British pacifists Category:British conscientious objectors Category:English Christian pacifists ","title":"Eric Baker (activist)"},{"id":"3002148","text":"Tellin' Stories is the fifth album by the British alternative rock band The Charlatans, released on 21 April 1997.

Other names include Drumsticks, and in Germany, Kugellauch. Some publications use the alternate spelling A. sphaerocephalum.E.g. It is a hardy perennial plant. Allium sphaerocephalon is found in the wild across all parts of Europe except in the northernmost countries (Ireland, Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the Baltic States).Altervista Flora Italiana, Schede di botanica, Allium sphaerocephalon Its native range extends to northern Africa and to western Asia as far east as Iran.Missouri Botanical Garden, Gardening Help, Allium sphaerocephalon It is also reportedly naturalised in New York State in the US.Biota of North America Program, Allium sphaerocephalon In the UK it grows wild only in the Avon Gorge so is known locally as the Bristol onion. The species is prized by gardeners because of its striking floral display. The spherical \\"head\\" (technically an umbel) is borne on a long scape, up to 50 cm in height, usually in July. It can contain hundreds of deep purple flowers. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Description Allium sphaerocephalon produces egg-shaped bulbs. Small bulblets are present under the outer layer of the stem (making the plant potentially invasive when grown in gardens). Flowers are borne on a scape up to 50 cm in height, in a spherical to egg-shaped umbel, 1‚Äì6 cm in diameter, tightly packed with many flowers crowded together. The relatively small size of the umbel relative to the height of the stem makes this one of those described as 'drumstick alliums'. Individual flowers are reddish-purple and are occasionally replaced by bulbils (again making this a potentially invasive species)., p. 135 ;Subspecies + varieties *Allium sphaerocephalon var. aegaeum (Heldr. & Hal√°csy) Hayek \\\\- Aegean Islands *Allium sphaerocephalon subsp. arvense (Guss.)

Constanza [1997] is an English case reaching the Court of Appeal and is well-known (amongst other cases) for establishing the legal precedent in English criminal law that assault could be committed by causing the victim to apprehend violence which was to take place some time in the not immediate future, that it is not necessary for the victim to see the potential perpetrator of the violence, and that it was for the prosecution to prove that fear was in the victim's mind, but how it got there is irrelevant. Facts Mr Constanza was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. The case against him was that his behaviour was such as to cause the victim (Louise Wilson) to feel that his actions posed a threat to her personal safety. The Crown maintained that Constanza's behaviour, which included, inter alia, following her, making silent telephone calls and writing on her door, and which was described as stalking, writing over 800 letters to her in 4 months, had caused this great fear. Constanza had delivered a letter by hand which when read caused belief Constanza had \\"flipped\\" and would use force against her. There was medical evidence of a resultant clinical state of depression and anxiety. The Crown said that Constanza's actions had occasioned actual bodily harm. Judgment Constanza appealed against his conviction on the grounds that the case ought not to have been left to the jury as the violence that the victim feared had not been sufficiently immediate because the victim could not see the potential perpetrator. Constanza also argued that an assault could not be committed solely by words, but physical action was necessary. The appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that the time to start measuring the immediacy of the apprehended violence is the time when the victim has the fear, that it would not be right to leave the case to the jury when the violence was anticipated at some time in the distant future and that it is not necessary for the victim to be able to see the potential perpetrator of the violence. In this case, as the victim had believed that the violence could occur at any time, the judge was entitled to leave the question of whether or not the victim had a fear of immediate violence to the jury. The Court of Appeal also held that it is for the Crown (the Prosecution) to prove that fear was in the victim's mind and that it is irrelevant how it got there and that certain conduct accompanying words could make that an assault. Therefore, the appellant had committed assault. Precautionary government reaction In case of further instances, argued or appealed successfully for the defence, based on remoteness of the truly feared action, Parliament, passing a government bill, introduced the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Its maximum sentence is custodial.
