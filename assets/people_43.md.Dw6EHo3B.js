He was an important leader both as a pagan as a Christian. A friend and the right hand of Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau, feared by all, renowned as a warrior, respected as a leader. It cost him a great deal to become a Christian as he did on Good Friday, 1845. As a Christian, his powers passed not from him. His island of Viwa, became a haven of refuge for persecuted Christians. Yet despite the limitation placed on him by his new faith, he was never disloyal to his king. Varani played a vital role in the protection of the early missionaries such as Reverend John Hunt and Wiliam Lyth to the Fiji group in the early 19th century. Under his protection, Christian missionaries managed to spread the influence of Christianity much more quickly than would have been expected. Cannibalism was still practiced at that time in Fiji. His story still stands today to show how a leader may be loyal both to god and country. His energies were expended in endeavor to lead fighting tribes to peace ‚Äì and in so doing he eventually paid the supreme price at Lovoni, Ovalau. Many Fijian Christians remember Ratu Ilaijia Varani as a fine example of real leadership ‚Äì leadership which does not lose sight of its Christian responsibility in public life. Memorials One of the four houses at the Lelean Memorial School, a Methodist Church of Fiji run school at its Davuilevu compound at Nausori, Fiji, is named after this great Christian Fijian chief.

Early life Hurst Castle Holmes was the son of Thomas Holmes of Kilmallock, co. Limerick and joined the Army. He was appointed Captain of Hurst Castle on the Isle of Wight in 1683. In March 1687 he was a lieutenant in a company of Grenadiers, and in November 1687 became lieutenant in the 8th Foot. He was a captain in 1689 and Major in 1692. In 1692, his uncle, Sir Robert Holmes of Thorley, left him his estates, provided he married Sir Robert's illegitimate daughter, Mary. Holmes married this Mary Holmes within 18 months and left the army. Career In 1695 Holmes lost the governorship of Hurst Castle after opposing the governor of the Isle of Wight Lord Cutts. However, he was returned as Member of Parliament for Yarmouth (Isle of Wight) on his own interest at a by election on 2 April 1695 and followed up being returned in a contest at the 1695 English general election. His dispute with Lord Cutts continued in the House of Commons, as he accused Cutts of discharging militia officers in Yarmouth who had voted against Holmes' rival, Cutts' brother-in- law John Acton. He refused to sign the Association, and in March 1696 voted against fixing the price of guineas at 22 shillings. In 1697, the House had to intervene to prevent a duel between Holmes and Lord Cutts. At the 1698 English general election, with the dispute with Cutts resolved, Holmes was returned unopposed as MP for Yarmouth. He was returned unopposed at the two general elections of 1701 as a Tory. In 1702, Holmes was restored to his post as governor of Hurst Castle, and he was returned unopposed again at the 1702 English general election. He was relatively inactive, but voted for the Tack on 28 November 1704. At the 1705 English general election, he was returned unopposed again and voted against the Court candidate for Speaker on 25 October 1705. He was returned as a Tory at the 1708 British general election and voted against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. At the 1710 British general election, he was returned again for Yarmouth as a Tory, and with the change of Administration was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1710. He was listed as a 'worthy patriot' who helped detect the mismanagements of the previous ministry in 1711. He was returned again as a Tory at the 1713 British general election but lost his post as lieutenant- governor on the Hanoverian succession. He was returned at a contest at the 1715 British general election, and voted against the septennial bill in 1716, but was unseated on petition on 12 April 1717. Death and legacy Holmes died on 23 June 1738, having had, with his wife, eight sons and eight daughters. His sons Thomas and Henry both sat for Parliament for Isle of Wight constituencies.

The site was originally a quilombo village. An association group still lives there, formally known as the Community Descendents of the Quilombos of Pedra do Sal (Portuguese: Comunidade Remanescentes de Quilombos da Pedra do Sal). The site was recognised in 1984 by INEPAC, the Institute for State Cultural Heritage (Instituto Estadual do Patrim√¥nio Cultural). Pedra do Sal is of special significance to residents of Rio de Janeiro of African descent. Additionally, it is a center of samba and choro music. Pedra do Sal is the center of the area known locally as \\"Little Africa\\", which originated in the collective houses of escaped and freed slaves. Great sambistas have played there, including Donga, Jo√£o da Baiana, Pixinguinha and Heitor dos Prazeres. History circa 1608 A group of migrants from Bahia moved to the Sa√∫de area as where prices were cheap and the area was close to the port where the men could find work with cargo ships. The first large docks of Rio de Janeiro and warehouses were being built at this time, the alleys and streets extended to Pedra da Prainha, later known as Pedra do Sal, where there was a large slave market. History circa 1817 As the Bahian population was concentrated around Pedra do Sal, it became a meeting place of the neighborhood. It became a point of cultural reference for the black population. In fact, the Bahian colony had an important impact on all parts of Carioca life, with even leaders of the city visiting the terreiros of Candombl√© and festivals in the area. The area gained a tradition of social cohesion, which influenced the whole heterogeneous community of the port. The house of Candombl√© belonging to Jo√£o Alab√° was one of the most important places for the Bahians, with many well-known M√£es-de-Santos met here, such as Ciata, Bibiana, M√¥nica and Perciliana. These women gained respect for their central positions in the terreiros and for their participation in the local community, helping integrate African traditions into the city and expanding the cultural life of the city. =Aunt Ciata= The most famous and influential M√£e-de-Santo was Hil√°ria Batista de Almeida, known as Aunt Ciata. She is mentioned in all reports about the early growth of samba Carioca and carnival groups. She was born in Salvador, Bahia in 1854, on the day of Saint Hilarius and arrived in Rio de Janeiro when she was 22. She fell in love with another Bahian, Norberto and had a daughter, Isabel. She was a confectioner, and sold her sweets on Rua da Carioca, always in Bahian traditional dress. Later, Aunt Ciata lived with Jo√£o Batista in a relationship that produced 15 children. A woman of great initiative and energy, she worked constantly and was a founder of the carioca tradition of Bahian \\"quituteiras\\" ‚Äì traditionally clad, snack sellers and unofficial representatives of Bahian culture, including Afro-Brazilian religions. In the first half of the 19th century, she was mentioned in the book titled \\"Viagem Pitoresca e Hist√≥rica do Brasil\\" by Jean-Baptiste Debret. In the terreiro of Jo√£o Alab√°, Aunt Ciata was responsible for preparing offerings for her saint. Aunt Ciata was the main creator and organisor of the ranchos of the Sa√∫de area. She was one of those responsible for the change in the nature of the early Carnaval parades. Besides those involved in the ranchos, various undesirable types would take to the street in groups and often instigate violence. The Rio carnaval only shed its brutal image in the first half of the 19th century, becoming more festive and eventually with the creation of the modern samba schools. Location The Sa√∫de neighbourhood, in which Pedra do Sal is located, is in the 1st Administrative Region of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), an area close to the central business district. Officially Sa√∫de is between Pra√ßa Mau√° and a Bar√£o de Tef√©, including the hill of Concei√ß√£o e Valongo. However, locals consider that the real and historical boundary of the neighbourhood is Gamboa.

The battle was significant in that one company of 4th Battalion, Kumaon Regiment under Major Somnath Sharma, who won a posthumous Param Vir Chakra, halted the momentum of advancing tribal \\"lashkars\\",The term \\"lashkar\\" in this context means a group of a thousand tribals of one ethnicity from North West Frontier Province, armed by Pakistani Army and encouraged to infiltrate and raid Kashmir for booty. though being killed to the last man and caused heavy casualties on the attacking force. Backdrop The battle took place at a point when Indian troops had just begun their fly-in into Srinagar airfield during the opening stages of the war. The lashkars were advancing along three axes - North of Wular lake, along the main Muzzafarabad-Baramula-Patan-Srinagar axis and from Gulmarg. Along the Gulmarg route, a lashkar of 700 raiders was known to be approaching Badgam but no contact had been made with it. The lashkar would soon be in a position to seize the airfield and block the induction of Indian troops by air. Alternatively, they could bypass the Patan defenses from the south and reach Srinagar unhindered. At that moment, only a weak brigade of Indian troops, withdrawn from refugee protection duties in Punjab and hastily airlifted, stood between groups of tribal lashkars advancing towards Srinagar. Indian troops were deployed only at Srinagar airfield, Magam and Pattan. A detachment of Mahrajah's Bodyguard (State Forces cavalry) reconnoitred North of Wular Lake. Patrol plan Brigadier L.P. Sen, newly arrived commander of 161 Infantry Brigade decided to send a strong fighting patrol to the hills overseeing Badgam village 5 km west of it. The task of the patrol was to search the area in the vicinity of Badgam and the area between Badgam and Magam for signs of the infiltrating Pakistanis. The patrol was to comprise two companies of 4th Battalion, Kumaon Regiment (4 KUMAON) reinforced with a company of 1st Battalion, Kumaon Regiment (1 KUMAON). The 1 KUMAON company was tasked to patrol ahead of Badgam by bounds, and link up with 1st Battalion, Punjab Regiment (1 PUNJAB) at Magam after which it would return by road. If no contact was made, the 4 KUMAON companies would fall back one by one, vacating Badgam at 1400 hrs. Battle of Badgam On 3 November 1947, Major Somnath Sharma, commanding D Company of 4 KUMAON, led the patrol. The patrol proceeded as planned without incident till the time came for withdrawing from Badgam. Sharma was ordered to fall back one company at a time, one company at 1400 hrs and he along with his company at 1500 hrs. At 1430 hrs, movement of tribals was seen to the West and near Badgam village. Sharma correctly surmised the movement in Badgam village was meant to divert attention while the attack would come in from the west. The lashkar attacked from the West. Sharma's company was soon surrounded by the enemy from three sides and sustained heavy casualties from the ensuing mortar bombardment. Sharma realized the importance of holding onto his position as both the city of Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if it were lost. Under heavy fire and outnumbered seven to one, he urged his company to fight bravely, often exposing himself to danger as he ran from post to post. Despite the forward two platoons falling, Sharma desperately clung to his position with the depth platoon. While he was busy fighting the enemy, a mortar shell exploded on the ammunition near him. His last message to Brigade HQ received a few moments before he was killed was: > \\"The enemies is only 50 yards from us. We are hopelessly outnumbered. I will > not withdraw one inch but fight to the last man last round.\\" Brigadier Sen ordered an reorganisation of the defenses. 1 PUNJAB was ordered to vacate Magam immediately and fall back to Srinagar. By nightfall troops of 1 PUNJAB were in Srinagar and detachment sent to approach the Badgam feature. By then the KUMAON position had been long overrun. Aftermath of battle The company of 4 KUMAON under Maj Som Nath Sharma was decimated. For his courageous \\"last man, last round\\" stand, Maj Sharma was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, Independent India's newly instituted highest award for gallantry.Entry on \\"Maj Somnath Sharma, PVC (Posthumous)\\" on Indian Army website. Accessed 6 August 2010. The fierce resistance of Sharma's company had caused 200 casualties to the raiders. Also, the tribal leader of the lashkar had a bullet through his leg. The Pakistani raiders made no attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities that night and move to the airfield or to Srinagar city. It is surmised that incapacitation of the leader, the heavy losses and reports of movement of 1 PUNJAB into the area had caused the raiders to misjudge the tactical situation. This bought time for additional Indian troops to in the valley to fall back from Patan to Srinagar, reorganise and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar.

History  The establishment of the Economic Council of the Arab League under the terms of the Joint Defence and Economic Co-operation Treaty (1950) was the fulfilment of the promise made in articles II and IV of the Arab League's Charter (1945), which required the establishment of a council to co-ordinate close co-operation of member-states in economic affairs.Ghantus 1982: 58 The Economic Council was renamed the Economic and Social Council in 1980.Ghantus 1982: 59  Responsibilities  The ESC continues to administer the Greater Arab Free Trade Area and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, as well as supervising the Council of Arab Economic Unity and other subsidiary institutions. =Arab Economic and Social Development summits= The Arab Economic and Social Development summits () are summits of the Arab League, held at the head of state level to address issues of economic and social development among member-states. The inaugural summit was held in 2009 in Kuwait, and the second summit was held in Egypt in 2011. Background On 29 March 2007, resolution 365, proposed by Egypt and Kuwait and calling for a summit to address exclusively the economic and social development issues facing the Arab world, was passed at the Arab League summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In June 2007, the secretary-general of the Arab League convened an extraordinary session of the ESC, which had been tasked with organising the summit under the terms of resolution 365, and it was agreed that the responsibility of preparing for the first summit would fall to a preparatory committee, consisting of Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, the chair of the ESC for the time being, and the two member-states that had proposed resolution 365, Egypt and Kuwait. In October 2007, the secretary-general appointed Egyptian ambassador Mervat Tellawi the co-ordinator-general for the upcoming summit and established a management committee within the framework of the general secretariat of the Arab League, later renamed the Development Summit Management Committee, that included the newly appointed co-ordinator- general, Mervat Tellawi, and various assistant secretaries-general of the Arab League. The summit was conceived as an opportunity to involve the private sector, and preparatory meetings were held by the Development Summit Management Committee with, inter alia, the Arab Banks Federation (November 2007), the General Union of Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture for Arab Countries (December 2007) and the Economic and Financial Affairs Committee of the Arab Parliament (May 2008). By the 2008 Arab League summit in Damascus, Syria, advanced progress had been reported by the preparatory committee to the eighty-first session of the ESC, and having received an offer to host the summit from the emir of Kuwait, US$2 million was approved by the Arab League for financing. 2009 summit On 19‚Äì20 January 2009, the first Arab Economic and Social Development Summit was duly held in Kuwait. Coming almost immediately after the Gaza War, the Arab media praised the summit for its success in reconciling the Arab world, and various resolutions were passed \\"in solidarity with Gaza\\". Among the other resolutions passed, there was a call for adopting necessary measures to establish an Arab customs union as of 2010, to be fully operational by 2015, to ultimately establish an Arab common market. 2011 summit Leaving the 2009 summit, Ahmed Nazif, the former Egyptian prime minister, announced that Egypt would hold the next summit in 2011. Among the issues to be discussed is the proposed Arab Plan of Action for Science and Technology, adopted at the 2009 summit, the implementation of which is being led by UNESCO and its Arab equivalent, the Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (ALECSO). 2013 summit The 2013 summit was held in the Saudi capital city of Riyadh. 2019 summit The 2019 summit was to be held in the Lebanese capital of Beirut on 19‚Äì20 March 2019. The speaker of the Parliament of Lebanon Nabih Berri called to invite Syria back to the summit, which has caused major turmoil in the Arab League.https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190327-the-implications-of-the- trilateral-summit/ The highly controversial summit has stirred tensions between Libya and the Lebanese Amal movement, stemming from the disappearance of Mussa Sadr, the Amal Movement's founder, who vanished along with his companions on August 31, 1978, in Libya while on an official visit.https://thearabweekly.com/vanished-imam-tears-apart-lebanese-libyan- relations  References   Bibliography   Category:Economy of the Arab League ","title":"Economic and Social Council (Arab League)"},{"id":"28278113","text":"John Stanley (1740 ‚Äì 1 April 1799) was a British politician and colonial lawyer.

IFOAM is running a program to recognize PGS in the organic sector. PGS is a tool that can be adopted not only for organic agriculture but is useful in various sectors. History The organic movement has been a pioneer in the implementation and definition of Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS). Organic certification started in various parts of the world in the 70s and 80s based on associative systems that were very close to what is now called PGS. Some of these associations are still doing participatory certification today, such as for example Nature & Progr√®s in France. Even though third party certification (following ISO 65 requirements) has become the dominant form of certification in the food sector, as well as many other sectors, alternative certification systems have never ceased to exist. In 2004, IFOAM and MAELA (the Latin American Agroecology Movement), jointly organized the first International Workshop on Alternative Certification that took place in Torres, Brazil. It is at that workshop that the concept of Participatory Guarantee Systems was adopted.http://ifoam.org/sites/default/files/page/files/internationalworkshoponalternativecertification_torres_en.pdf At this event, an international working group on PGS was established,http://ifoam.org/sites/default/files/page/files/internationalworkshoponalternativecertification_torres_en.pdf which later became an official Task Forcehttp://www.ifoam.org/en/value- chain/participatory-guarantee-systems-pgs under the umbrella of IFOAM. The Task Force worked on further defining PGS, and established the key elements and key features of PGS in a document entitled ‚ÄúShared Visions ‚Äì Shared Ideals‚Äù.http://www.ifoam.org/sites/default/files/page/files/ifoam_pgs_web.pdf Since then IFOAM has continuously supported the development of PGS and are now advocating for their recognition by governments as valid local certification systems in cases where the organic sector is legally regulated. In parallel, other sectors have been looking into the concept to certify various products or processes. Government policies and regulations towards PGS  = Brazil = In 2007, the State enacted a law that recognizes both the third-party certification and PGS for certification of organic produce. Since then, PGS certified produce have been sold domestically in the Brazilian market. = India = The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), IFOAM, and the Ministry of Agriculture in India initiated consultations with various stakeholders in 2005 to identify alternative certifications systems that are inclusive of the many small farmers and peasants in the country. The PGS Organic India Council was set up in 2006 as a result of these consultations. It functioned as an informal coalition of Voluntary Organizations or NGOs committed to the promotion of organic food production for domestic consumption in India, with export not being a priority at all. In April 2011, it was formally registered as a society in Goa as Participatory Guarantee Systems Organic Council (PGSOC). Many of the federal states within India have incorporated promotion of PGS for certification of organic produce in their state-level agriculture policies. At the national level, the National Centre of Organic Farming (NCOF) under the Ministry of Agriculture began to operate the PGS-India as a voluntary organic guarantee programme with the PGS-National Advisory Committee as the apex decision making body.

He was one of a band of Tongan teachers who came to Fiji in 1838, and pioneered the work of the Christian Church in this group. He served the Church in Fiji for almost four decades. Many others were great in the same way. Paula Vea, another dynamic Christian missionary was a contemporary of his. Life We would think of Joeli Bulu as the leader of a fine team of workers sent by King George of Tonga to spread the Church in Fiji. Joeli was converted and called to preach in Tonga and later ‚Äòcalled‚Äô to Fiji. He came to Lakeba by canoe, and was appointed to help with the printing of catechisms and passages of Scriptures. Lorimer Fison translated Bulu's oral account of his life. This was edited by George Stringer Rowe and printed in England in 1871 with the title \\"Joel Bulu: The Autobiography of a Native Minister in the South Seas\\". It contains his adventures in fires, storms, wars and floods, including some miraculous escapes. Some believe that he was a ‚Äòchosen vessel‚Äô protected by Providence in no ordinary way. He survived death many times, yet was spared to serve a 40-year ministry. He served first at Lakeba and then at Rewa, and after that the station was closed because of the wars, at Viwa. John Hunt sent him to investigate possibilities of establishing the work in Vanua Levu, and to that field he was later appointed. He was the first Pacific islander to be placed alone in charge of a circuit ‚Äì Ono, in 1848, and also the first to be ordained (1850) as a Native Assistant Missionary. After this he served at Nadi (Vanua Levu), Bua and Cakaudrove where he pioneered the work before any white missionaries were established there. When the Cakaudrove station was finally established Joeli was found in charge of an institution for training catechists. Afterwards he was appointed to Bau, where he served as Cakobau‚Äôs own chaplain. Bulu died in May 1877. His grave is beside that of John Hunt at Viwa Island. He came to Fiji from his own land and gave himself wholly, and finally found his grave with the sons of her own soil. The Lelean Memorial School, a Methodist run school at Davuilevu, Nausori, Fiji honours his name by naming one its four houses after him. His remarks concerning his decision to convert to Christianity, \\"I will lotu (accept Christ as my Saviour) so that I may live among the stars\\", became the title of a book, \\"To Live Among the Stars\\", by John Garrett.

Distribution and habitat The plant is endemic to Austria, northern Italy (Friuli‚ÄìVenezia Giulia and Veneto), and Slovenia. It grows most readily in limestone crevices in the Julian, Kamnik‚ÄìSavinja Alps and the Peca Mountain, as well as in the dolomitic Alps of Italy and Austria. Favratia zoysii can survive in temperatures as low as . Garden pests include slugs and snails. Description Mature plant with a cross section of a flower and closeup of seeds The plant tends to grow low, reaching anywhere from in height, though some plants may grow as tall as . Tufts (or \\"cushions\\") of the plant tend to creep outward as it grows. Seedlings require two years to grow to flower. =Flowers= The genus is unique among its family of bellflowers. The mouth of F. zoysii's bell-shaped flower narrows, ending in a five-pointed star, while the flowers of Campanula species are likewise bell- shaped, but open. (The \\"pinched\\" shape of these flowers nonetheless manages to allow insects inside for pollination.) The flowers are arranged one to three for each stem. The plant's pale sky blue- to lavender-colored flowers bloom in June over a three- to four-week period. =Leaves= Leaves are crowded at the root, stalked, ovate and blunt; stem leaves are obovate, lance-shaped and linear. Cultural significance Favratia zoysii is held in high regard in Slovenia. It is considered a symbol of the Slovene Alps, and was called \\"the true daughter of the Slovene mountains\\" by the renowned botanist Viktor Petkov≈°ek (1908‚Äì1994). It is the symbol of the oldest (and the only one in the natural environment) alpine garden in Slovenia, Alpinum Juliana, established in 1926. Favratia zoysii is highly esteemed as an ornamental plant in rock gardens. The September 1905 issue of Gardeners' Chronicle praises F. zoysii as \\"choicest and most distinct ... of a genus comprising flowers of the greatest beauty and of the highest merit in the garden\\". The plant was named by the botanist Franz Xaver von Wulfen (1728‚Äì1805) in honor of its discoverer, the botanist Karl von Zois (1756‚Äì1799), who introduced it to him. It was first described by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1789.

Politically, African Americans have made substantial strides in the post‚Äìcivil rights era. Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson ran for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, attracting more African Americans into politics and unprecedented support and leverage for people of colour in politics. In 2008, Barack Obama was elected as the first President of the United States of African descent. In the same period, African Americans have suffered disproportionate unemployment rates following industrial and corporate restructuring, with a rate of poverty in the 21st century that is equal to that in the 1960s.

He also received overwhelming support from whites, a majority of Asians, and Americans of Hispanic origin.Why Asian Americans Voted For Obama . Obama lost the overall white vote, but he won a larger proportion of white votes than any previous non-incumbent Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter.  Economic situation  At some levels, African Americans have made real economic progress, moving into a variety of middle-class and professional positions. Although nearly 25% of black Americans in the early 21st century live below the poverty line, approximately the same percentage as in 1968, many more African Americans rank higher up the economic ladder and have achieved advanced educations. But the child poverty rate has increased among African Americans and their unemployment is disproportionately high in comparison to other ethnic groups. These sobering facts have been masked in the public opinion by the sometimes spectacular achievements of successful individuals. African Americans are underrepresented in the rapidly expanding and lucrative fields related to computer programming and technology, where innovations have led to some people making huge new fortunes. Economic progress for blacks' reaching the extremes of wealth has been slow. According to Forbes \\"richest\\" lists, Oprah Winfrey was the richest African American of the 20th century and has been the world's only black billionaire in 2004, 2005, and 2006. Not only was Winfrey the world's only black billionaire but she has been the only black on the Forbes 400 list nearly every year since 1995. BET founder Bob Johnson briefly joined her on the list from 2001 to 2003 before his ex-wife acquired part of his fortune; although he returned to the list in 2006, he did not make it in 2007. Blacks currently comprise 0.25% of America's economic elite; they make up 13% of the total U.S. population. Social issues Nonmarital birth rates by race in the United States from 1940 through 2014. Rate for African Americans is shown in purple. Data is from the National Vital Statistics System reports published by the CDC National Center for Health Statistics. Note: Prior to 1969, nonmarital births among African Americans were included with other minority groups as \\"Non-White\\". Despite the gains of the civil rights movement, other factors have resulted in African-American communities suffering from extremely high incarceration rates of their young males. Contributing factors have been the drug war waged by successive administrations, imposition of sentencing guidelines at the federal and state levels, cutbacks in government assistance, restructuring of industry since the mid-20th century and extensive loss of working-class jobs leading to high poverty rates, and government neglect, a breakdown in traditional family units, and unfavorable social policies. African Americans have the highest imprisonment rate of any major ethnic group in the United States and the world, and are sentenced to death at a rate higher than any other ethnic group. The southern states of the former Confederacy, which historically had maintained slavery longer than in the remainder of the country and imposed post-Reconstruction oppression, have the highest rates of incarceration and application of the death penalty.\\"One in 31: The Long Reach of American Corrections\\" , Pew Research Center, released March 2, 2009 See also * Timeline of African-American history * Timeline of the civil rights movement References Category:African-American history ","title":"Post‚Äìcivil rights era in African-American history"},{"id":"28278251","text":"Kurt Haseloff (1894‚Äì1978) was a German general during World War II.

While most sleepers with this condition will report not having slept in the previous night at all or having slept very little,Insomnia Causes. Healthcommunities.com. Original Publication: 01 Dec 2000. Updated: 01 Dec 2007. clinical recordings generally show normal sleep patterns. Though the sleep patterns found in those with SSM have long been considered indistinguishable from those without, some preliminary research suggest there may be subtle differences (see Symptoms and diagnosis: Spectral analysis). Patients are otherwise generally in good health, and any illnesses‚Äîsuch as depression‚Äîappear to be more associated with fear of negative consequences of insomnia (\\"insomnia phobia\\") than from any actual loss of sleep. Sleep state misperception was adopted by the ICSD to replace two previous diagnostic terminologies: \\"subjective insomnia complaint without objective findings\\" and \\"subjective sleepiness complaint without objective findings.\\" Classification Sleep state misperception is classified as an intrinsic dyssomnia.Dysomnia causes . Icantgetnosleep.info. November 4, 2009The International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Holisticonline.com While SSM is regarded a sub-type of insomnia, it is also established as a separate sleep-condition, with distinct pathophysiology. Nonetheless, the value of distinguishing this type of insomnia from other types is debatable due to the relatively low frequency of SSM being reported. Sleep state misperception can also be further broken down into several types, by patients who: * report short sleep (subjective insomnia complaint without objective findings) ** or no sleep at all (subjective total insomnia) * report excessive daytime sleepiness (subjective sleepiness complaint without objective findings) * report sleeping too much (subjective hypersomnia without objective findings) Symptoms and diagnosis Sleep waves (EEG highlighted above) recorded from those with SSM may appear indistinguishable from those without. This sleep disorder frequently applies when patients report not feeling tired despite their subjective perception of not having slept.Insomnia Information Sleepnet.com - Insomnia Information Generally, they may describe experiencing several years of no sleep, short sleep, or non-restorative sleep. Otherwise, patients appear healthy, both psychiatrically and medically. (That this condition is often asymptomatic could explain why it is relatively unreported.) However, upon clinical observation, it is found that patients may severely overestimate the time they took to fall asleep‚Äîoften reporting having slept half the amount of time indicated by polysomnogram or electroencephalography (EEG), which may record normal sleep. Observing such discrepancy between subjective and objective reports, clinicians may conclude that the perception of poor sleep is primarily illusionary. Alternatively, some people may report excessive daytime sleepiness or chronic disabling sleepiness, while no sleep disorder has been found to exist. Methods of diagnosing sleepiness objectively, such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test do not confirm the symptom\\"true\\" sleepiness is not observed despite the complaint. (It may be speculated that such reports of daytime sleepiness may be a result of the nocebo response ‚Äîthe reverse of the placebo effect‚Äîdue to patient expectations of adverse effects from their subjective perception of poor sleep.) Finally, on the opposite end of the spectrum, other patients may report feeling that they have slept much longer than is observed. It has been proposed that this experience be subclassified under sleep state misperception as \\"positive sleep state misperception\\", \\"reverse sleep state misperception\\", and \\"negative sleep state misperception\\". =Diagnostic criteria= The patient has a complaint of insomnia while sleep quality and duration are normal. Polysomnographic monitoring demonstrates normal sleep latency, a normal number of arousals and awakenings, and normal sleep duration with or without a multiple sleep latency test that demonstrates a mean sleep latency of greater than 10 minutes. No medical or mental disorder produces the complaint. Other sleep disorders producing insomnia are not present to a degree that would explain the patient‚Äôs complaint. =Detection and difficulties= Detecting sleep state misperception by objective means has been elusive. A 2011 study published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine has shown that sleep misperception (i.e., underestimation of sleep duration) is prevalent among chronic insomniacs who sleep objectively more than 6 hours in the sleep lab. The psychological profile of these chronic insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration is characterized by depressive, anxious- ruminative traits and poor coping resources. Thus, it appears that not all chronic insomniacs underestimate their sleep duration, and that sleep misperception is a clinical characteristic of chronic insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration. Furthermore, rumination and poor coping resources may play a significant role in sleep misperception.Fernandez-Mendoza J, Calhoun S, Bixler E, Karataraki M, Liao D, Vela-Bueno A, Ramos-Platon M, Sauder K, Basta M, Vgontzas A. \\"Sleep Misperception and Chronic Insomnia in the General Population: The Role of Objective Sleep Duration and Psychological Profiles.\\" Psychosomatic Medicine, 2011; 73(1): 88-97. doi:10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181fe365a. =Spectral analysis= According to a May 2014 article published in New Scientist, spectral analysis may help clinicians find objective evidence for sleep state misperception: =Distinction from insomnia= What is considered objective insomnia, unlike SSM, can easily be confirmed empirically through clinical testing, such as by polysomnogram. Those who experience SSM may believe that they have not slept for extended periods of time, when they in fact do sleep but without perceiving it. For example, while patients who claim little or no sleep may usually acknowledge impaired job performance and daytime drowsiness, sleep state misperceivers often do not.Paradoxical Insomnia Cases of objective total insomnia are extremely rare. The few that have been recorded have predominantly been ascribed to a rare incurable genetic disorder called fatal familial insomnia, which patients rarely survive for more than 26 months after the onset of illness‚Äîoften much less.Schenkein, Joyce Fatal Familial Insomnia. Part 1: What Is Fatal Familial Insomnia. Medscape. Treatment Behavioral treatment can be effective in some cases. Sedative hypnotics may also help relieve the symptoms.Hauri PJ. \\"Primary insomnia.\\" Principles and practice of sleep medicine. 2nd ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1994. Additionally, education about normal patterns of the sleep-wake cycle may alleviate anxiety in some patients. For patients with severe depression resulting from the fear of having insomnia, electroconvulsive therapy appears to be a safe and effective treatment. =Complications= A subject who is not being monitored (by a recording or other observer) may not have a way to tell if a treatment is working properly due to the amnesic nature of SSM. The condition may worsen as a result of persistent attempts to treat the symptoms through conventional methods of dealing with insomnia. The prescription of hypnotics or stimulants may lead to drug dependency as a complication. Nonetheless, chronic SSM may increase risk for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. It has also been noted that patients with this condition may sometimes opt to take medications over other treatments \\"for the wrong reasons (e.g. because of euphoriant properties).\\" Epidemiology SSM is poorly understood. As of 2008, there is little to no information regarding risk factors or prevention, though it is believed to be most prevalent among young to middle aged adults. Distribution among the general population and by gender is unknown. About 5% of the clinical population may be affected, though that figure is subject to sampling bias.

In 1966 the first International Clown Week chairman, Frank \\"Kelly the Clown\\" Kelly, was appointed by Ray Bickford, president of Clown Club of America. In 1967 Clown Club of America members were urged to write to their congressmen and senators requesting a presidential proclamation naming August 1‚Äì7 as National Clown Week. In 1969 a resolution was introduced. After clowns met with Senator John McClellan of Arkansas who was chairman of the United States Senate subcommittee on Observances and Holidays success was finally achieved. Concurrently, Bill \\"Boom-Boom\\" Baily, was an original member of Clowns of America when it was founded in 1967. Baily was named the U.S. Chairman of National Clown Week for that organization. Because each year a chairman had to be chosen in each state to ask their governor to issue a proclamation honoring National Clown Week, Bill pushed for National Clown Week publicity. He convinced Congressman Garmatz of Maryland and Congressman Myers of Indiana to introduce a joint resolution in Congress establishing National Clown Week as an annual event. He lobbied the United States Congress and organized a visit by clowns to the senate building in Washington, D.C.

In France he is usually known as Henri Scheffer. Personal life Scheffer was the younger brother of painter Ary Scheffer, son of Johann Baptist and Cornelia Scheffer and grandson of Arie Lamme. When his father died in 1809, his mother first moved to Brussels and in 1811 to Paris. His daughter Corn√©lie married French philosopher Ernest Renan. Their son Ary Renan also became a painter. Work Scheffers, like his brother Ary, was a pupil of Pierre-Narcisse Gu√©rin. His work was much sought after in his lifetime. He mainly painted genre pieces and portraits which were finely crafted. His work was exhibited at the Salon from 1824 onwards and was heavily criticised by Charles Baudelaire The 1845 Salon on the Litteratura website and Th√©ophile Gautier. The 1845 Salon on the Theophile Gautier website Scheffers best known work is probably a picture portraying the arrest of Charlotte Corday (now in the Mus√©e Lambinet), some selected others: * Louis-Joseph de Vend√¥me (now in the mus√©e de Vend√¥me) * Fran√ßois Arago, the basis for the well known engraving by Alexandre Vincent Sixdeniers * Armand Carrel * Casimir Delavigne (now in mus√©e national du ch√¢teau et des Trianons, in the Palace of Versailles) * Ernest Renan (now in the Mus√©e de la Vie Romantique) * Augustin Thierry Selected other works: *An Inundation in Rome *Joan of Arc entering Orl√©ans (now in Versailles) *Hermann and Dorothea *Madame Roland *Preaching after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes *The Battle of Cassel (now in Versailles) *The dream of Charles IX in the night of St. Bartholomew, based on the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre His work has been copied many times in engravings.

Parish's book Mirages of International Justice (2011) Matthew Parish, \\"Mirages of International Justice: The Elusive Pursuit of a Transnational Legal Order\\" (London: Edward Elgar 2011) advances a constructivist account of international law. He thinks sovereign states would never agree to create genuinely impartial and independent international courts that would enforce international law against themselves. Thus international courts are deliberately made powerless, and they occupy precarious roles in the balance of power in which they are liable to make decisions in accordance with Great Power interests. International tribunals proliferate not because states want to see international justice done but because they want to associate themselves with the ideals captured in discourse about international law without making any real commitments. The world of international relations remains an anarchy, but international courts (and indeed international organizations in general) are part of an illusion that the world is ordered in accordance with moral principles. Nevertheless, Parish is a defender of controversial investment treaty arbitration, a system of international law that allows investors to sue states. Parish was elected as a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum in 2013 and has also been named as one of the 300 most influential people in Switzerland by Bilan Magazine.

It was one of four pieces forming the television component of the $25m \\"Play\\" campaign, which had been running for several months. Tag was created by advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy. Production was handled by production company Gorgeous Enterprises, who assigned director Frank Budgen to oversee the project. Filming took place in Toronto, Ontario. The commercial premiered on American television on 25 June 2001, and ran until Labor Day (3 September). It was supported by three additional television and cinema commercials, titled Shaderunner, Tailgating, and Racing, which ran concurrently. There was also a significant offline campaign, comprising public events in the streets of major American cities, and invitation-only parties at Niketown stores attended by celebrities. Tag, and its associated campaign, were a huge critical success, garnering dozens of awards from the advertising and television industries, including the Grand Prix at the prestigious Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. Tag was one of the ten most-awarded commercials of 2002, and its impact was such that in 2010 it was voted one of the top ten advertisements of the decade by Campaign magazine. Sequence Tag opens with a sequence of shots of a modern metropolis, bustling with cars and pedestrian traffic. An unidentified person approaches a man on the street and places their hand on his shoulder, then flees before their target can turn around. The man looks exasperated for a moment as he realises that he has just been tagged as \\"It\\" in a citywide game of Tag. People begin to scatter in all directions away from him. He runs down the street to a bus, which promptly shuts its door on him and pulls away. People lock themselves into their cars as he approaches, while others duck into nearby buildings; one hides himself in the opposite side of a revolving door to avoid being tagged. Crowds empty off the streets, while others huddle in lines behind the partial cover given by wastebins, scattering when they are spotted. The tagged man chases a group into a subway station, where they cram themselves into a departing train. He manages to jam his arm between the closing doors, but the people in reach shrink away. He frustratedly pulls his arm out of the door and, after glancing to his left, begins strolling nonchalantly past the train, its occupants jammed against the window watching him. The camera cuts ahead to reveal a lone straggler who failed to make it onto the train. As he spots the tagged man, he turns to flee and the commercial ends with the pair continuing the chase outside of the view of the camera, a superimposed swoosh accompanying the campaign tagline, \\"Play\\".

The approach was successful; by 2001, Nike's U.S. sales were three times that of their nearest competitor, Reebok.Peacock, Kathy Wilson; \\"Nike: Play Campaign\\", The Encyclopedia of Major Marketing Campaigns, Volume 2, Thomson Gale, pp. 1144-1147 . However, Reebok had just launched an aggressive new campaign for their new RBK line of shoes, backed by celebrities such as Allen Iverson, Jadakiss, R. Kelly, and Missy Elliott. They also had just signed a 10-year deal to provide equipment and uniforms to the NBA, a contract previously held by Nike. Other companies, such as Adidas and New Balance were also eating away at Nike's market share. While Nike's campaigns (including 9000 Shots, Hello World, and Move, among others) were designed with no particular demographic in mind, they appealed more to personalities who took sports seriously. It was with this in mind that, in 2001, W+K proposed a new campaign aimed at those with a more lighthearted approach to sports, aiming to promote the wearing of Nike sportswear as fashionable in everyday life, as well as in athletic environments. =Production= This campaign, titled \\"Play\\", was handled by a five-man teamHeim, Sarah J;\\"Nike Exhorts the Public to 'Play'\\", Adweek, 2 July 2001.

While 400 extras were recruited from agencies for Tag, the actor playing the piece's protagonist was chosen from the street outside the set just before filming began. The crew shot on 16 mm film using three cameras to allow editors to cut to different perspectives while keeping each scene to one take.

Tag was supported on-air by its sister pieces Shaderunner, Tailgating, Racing, online by the \\"Play\\" website, and off- air by a significant outdoor and event campaign. For the outdoor component of \\"Play\\", W+K hired teams of street artists in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago to sketch playground games such as hopscotch on the pavement outside of prominent businesses, together with the Nike swoosh and the campaign name and website.Brannon, Keith; \\"Ad exec for Nike to return to job at local agency.\\", New Orleans CityBusiness, 25 February 2002.

The online component of the campaign, designed by Vancouver-based company Blast Radius, comprised a dedicated website, e-mail competitions and online games. It was the first Nike advertising campaign to make use of user-submitted video--people would upload clips of themselves or others at play, and the campaign team ran them on the \\"Play\\" website and invited others to comment. Tag, and its associated campaign, was a financial and critical success. Nike's profits for the quarter following the release of the campaign rose 8.3%, despite the fact that sales in the United States fell 2% in the same period, likely due to the economic turmoil following the September 11 attacks. Nike ended the fiscal year with sales up 5.5%. It was successful in shifting public and media perceptions of the brand.

It is part of a line connecting Berlin and Halle / Leipzig via Dessau. History  In 1841, the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company () completed its main line from Berlin to Dessau via Wittenberg. In 1879 the Berlin-Blankenheim railway, opened as part of the Cannons Railway (Kanonenbahn) project, was a link from the Berlin Stadtbahn via Belzig, Wiesenburg to G√ºsten and continuing to western Germany. Because of its primarily military function, this route mainly avoided all major towns. Only in the 1920s, very late for a major railway, was a connection built between Wiesenburg and Ro√ülau, closing the gap between two lines and significantly shortening the line between Berlin and Dessau. On 1 April 1921, the section was opened from Jeber-Bergfrieden to the connection with the Wittenberg line at Meinsdorf; on 1 June 1923 this was followed by the opening of the section from Wiesenburg to Jeber-Bergfrieden. The new route quickly carried a large amount of traffic from the Berlin-Blankenheim railway. In 1934 express trains operated between Berlin and Wiesbaden and Berlin and Frankfurt over the track. After the division of Germany in 1945, and especially after the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the line was unattractive for direct long-distance passenger trains from Halle and Leipzig to Berlin because eastern Berlin could only be reached indirectly via the Berlin outer ring; instead trains went via Wittenberg. However, the line via Wiesenburg was important for freight transport because it was the shortest route between the Halle/Leipzig industrial region and the large freight yard at Seddin. Passenger services in the 1970s and 1980s included express trains on the Rostock‚ÄìPotsdam‚ÄìKarl-Marx- Stadt and on the Berlin‚ÄìBelzig‚ÄìDessau‚ÄìAschersleben routes. Also, interzone trains ran between West Berlin and West Germany on this line. After German reunification, the importance of the line increased at first, since it was the fastest connection from southern and western Germany to West Berlin. A number of express trains‚Äîand in the second half of the 1990s, Berlin‚ÄìFrankfurt Interregio services‚Äîused the line. This changed gradually with the upgrading of the Berlin‚ÄìHalle line via Wittenberg and the opening of the Berlin North‚ÄìSouth mainline through the Tiergarten Tunnel in 2006. Since then, almost all long-distance trains use the faster route via Wittenberg; the last InterCity train stopped at Dessau in 2007. The only long-distance trains to use the line now are night trains. Regional-Express service RE7 between Berlin and Dessau runs on the line at two hourly intervals (with extra trains in the peak hour).

At the same time he also attended classes at the Antwerp Academy where he obtained a second prize for drawing after the Antique in March 1771. He specialized in landscapes and the rendering of the coat of animals in particular of sheep.Catalogue du Mus√©e d'Anvers, Second Edition, 1857, pp. 463‚Äì469 Landscape with figures On 26 June 1781 he married Petronilla Isabella Maria Jacoba Parrin in Antwerp.

In 1789 he became dean of the Guild of St. Luke of Antwerp, the penultimate dean as the Guild was dissolved by the French occupiers in 1794. In 1796 he was appointed professor at the Antwerp Acad√©mie de peinture, sculpture et architecture d'Anvers. Grazing cows, sheep, goats and horses In 1799 a painting of Ommeganck won the first prize for landscapes in Paris. Ommeganck had not wished to participate in the Paris competition but the painting was submitted by a friend without his knowledge. In 1809 he became a corresponding member of the Institut de France, which had been established on 25 October 1795 to group France's five acad√©mies. He was also a member of the Academies of Amsterdam, Brussels, Ghent, Munich and Vienna. In 1800 he was invited to become together with Willem Jacob Herreyns a teacher of the members of the newly established Genootschap der Kunsten ((Society for the arts')). This was an organisation set up at the initiative of Mattheus Ignatius van Bree and included initially Jan van Bree, Jean-Baptiste Berr√©. Lambrecht Dentijn, Jan Carpentero, Ferdinand Verhoeven, Peter Iven, Michiel Dierickxen, Jan Peeters and others. The members undertook to meet to show and discuss their works and enjoy the tuition of the older generation of painters. At the end of 1800 the Konstmaatschappij which had been established in 1788 was merged with the Genootschap der Kunsten. The merged organisation would organise an annual exhibition of its members' works. He was one of the commissioners who were appointed by the Dutch government in 1815 to recover from France the objects of art which France had stolen during the occupation. In 1816 he became fourth class member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. His students included Jan Baptiste de Jonghe, Fr√©d√©ric Th√©odore Faber, Pieter Martinus Gregoor, Jacob van Kouwenhoven, Hendrik Aarnout Myin, Ignatius Josephus van Regemorter, Adrianus de Visser, Eug√®ne Joseph Verboeckhoven, Julien-Joseph Ducorron and his sister Maria Jacoba Ommeganck. He died in Antwerp. Work Shepherd and flock Ommeganck was very successful during his lifetime and his works demanded high prices. His main contribution to landscape painting was the combination in his works of the light found in the work of the Dutch Italianate painters of the 17th century with detailed observation of nature. He was thus able to find a synthesis between realism and an idealized representation of nature. His work shows a painstaking attention to detail, a sure line and subtle use of colour. His preferred subjects were undulating landscapes. He painted mainly on panel. Ommeganck renewed the Belgian landscape tradition through his careful observation of the local picturesque landscape. This he combined with an interest in representing atmospheric conditions and the warm light of the rising or setting sun. The concept of the ideal landscape influenced the compositions of his works. This preoccupation was linked to a more direct curiosity for the landscape, which led him towards a topographical and descriptive representation of the landscape.Caroline van Eck, Het schilderachtige: studies over het schilderachtige in de Nederlandse kunsttheorie en architectuur, 1650-1900, Architectura & Natura Pers, 1994, p. 93 Ommeganck's style was widely followed in the 18th and early 19th century. Later art critics have not always been equally positive about the work of Ommeganck. Some have made the reproach that by embedding itself in the classic tradition and through its preference for the contrived, picturesque and the conventional, the landscape tradition of Ommeganck represents a 'hopeless traditionalism'.Lut Pil, Pour le plaisir des yeux: het pittoreske landschap in de Belgische kunst : 19de-eeuwse retoriek en beeldvorming, Garant, 1 Jan 1993, p.1-2 He also made a few portraits such as that of the Painter Jean-Baptiste Berr√© (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). He was a skilled draughtsman and also worked as a sculptor producing some clay models of sheep and cows.

A. Tolstoy. After Tolstoy's death in 1913, ownership devolved to his widow Countess Olga Tolstoy (born a princess of the Vasilchikov family, daughter of Prince Alexander Illarionovich Vasilchikov, a second in the famous 1841 duel between Mikhail Lermontov and Nikolai Martynov).Lermontov's duel with NS –ú–∞—Ä—Ç—ã–Ω–æ–≤—ã–º Martynov, ruslibrary.ru Architecture Tolstoy House, Fontanka Embankment viewThe building design shows elements typical of the creative work of Fydor Lidval: high Renaissance arches, balconies on the upper floors, restraint and refinement of decorative elements, respect for comfort, and an eye for natural lighting. From the first, the building was provided with a laundry, plumbing, and elevators. The structure was conceived as a home for all classes, with apartments for people of all incomes, from modest to luxurious. The complex layout of the building includes a sequence of three connected arched courtyards leading from Rubinstein Street to the embankment of the Fontanka River. The facades of the three main courtyards are decorated as carefully as the front of the building (although on either side of the building are less decorated courtyards into which the back doors of the apartments open). The facades use hewed limestone, brick, and stucco. In the central courtyard there was a Roman-style fountain designed and built by Lidval. This fountain was in place until the 1950s but was completely lost by the 1990s. Tolstoy House, view from courtyardInitially, there were passages in the center of the courtyards, and a small lawn which occupied only a very narrow strip along the original streets. In Soviet times, the appearance was significantly altered: in the middle of the yard, driveways were made, the lawns were planted with poplars, and a statue was installed in the fountain. Thus was lost Lidval's original concept of an internal street. Architectural monument In 2008, the house was made a protected art and cultural monument under the aegis of the HOA. In 2009, Marina Kolotilo was made chairman of the HOA Tolstoy House. HOA is making efforts to repair, restore, and preserve the Tolstoy House. Kolotilo has begun an effort to establish a museum in the Tolstoy House and is preparing a program celebrating its 100th anniversary. The building is designated an Architectural Monument of Regional Significance (number 7800770000). It is part of UNESCO World Heritage Site number 540, Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments. In 1988 it was given additional protected status as part of the Joint Security Area of St. Petersburg. However, in 2008, after reducing the buffer zone, the status of the building has been downgraded to Zone Controlled Building. In cinema The Tolstoy House appears as a setting in several Russian films. Most of Igor Maslennikov's 1985 film Winter Cherries takes place in the Tolstoy House, in its yards, or near it. In this film, the Tolstoy House serves as a kind of actor itself, playing up to the stars of the film and creating a certain mood.

It is a humoristic adventure strip about two friends, Piet Pienter and Bert Bibber and their female friend Susan. It was published in the Flemish dialect and notable for being one of the few comics series to never fully adapt the standard Dutch language and, apart from the final album, remained published in black-and-white. Creator Pom also enjoyed making puns and drawing funny signs in the background, often spoofing well known advertisements. For instance: \\"Oma wast beter\\" (literally: \\"Grandma does the laundry better\\", a pun on the detergent brand Omo). He was particularly notorious for adding ironic commentary about his own stories while narrating the story. Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber 's popularity was considerable, but proved to be mostly a local Flemish phenomenon; being published in Antwerp newspapers, it was above all popular in that area. Over the years Pom started to dislike his profession, causing new albums to appear less and less frequent. In 1995 the series was terminated, because a certain type of paper that he used for all his stories wasn't produced anymore. Since Pom strongly disliked giving interviews or providing any sort of media attention to himself or his characters Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber, the series faded somewhat out of public view over the decades, despite being fondly remembered by many comics fans. History The first story was published in 1951, in the Antwerp newspaper Het Handelsblad. From the tenth album on, in 1955, all stories were pre-published in the daily Gazet van Antwerpen. The albums were published by Uitgeverij De Vlijt, who also published that newspaper. In 1995 the final story was published by Standaard Uitgeverij, who took over the reprints of all the previous albums too. In 2010 comics artist Tom Bouden drew a homage album about Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber. He received official permission to use the characters, provided that it remained a one- shot album. Another homage album, \\"Op het spoor van Pom\\" (2011), contained contributions by 60 Flemish comics artists, with the money being spent for cancer research. Characters * Piet Pienter: Piet is the hero and straight man of the series. As his name implies he is very smart (\\"pienter\\" means \\"clever\\" in Dutch) and usually more calm and level-headed. He is furthermore notable for smoking pipe and according to \\"Het Vredeswapen\\" an engineer, especially into electronics, much like Pom himself. * Bert Bibber: Bert is Piet's best friend and shares house with him. As his name implies he is kind of a coward (\\"bibber\\" means \\"shiver\\" in Dutch). Due to his impulsive nature, tendency to panic or get aggressive, and general stupidity he provides most of the comic relief in the series. In \\"In het spoor van Sherlock Holmes\\" he is a private detective, while in early albums like \\"Het gestolen Vredeswapen\\". \\"De Incaschat der Cordillera\\" and \\"Het Raadsel van de Schimmenburcht\\" he is a travelling salesman. * Susan: Susan is the daughter of an American billionaire. She is a feisty and attractive young woman who has often helped Piet and Bert with their problems, especially when they lack money. Bert is secretly in love with her, as is Theo Flitser; but there is no mention of either scoring any real success with her, beyond her visiting the \\"Ice Revue\\" show with Flitser. Cruising the world in her private yacht initially, over the course of the series she moves in to live at Piet and Bert's house. * Professor Kumulus: A genius professor, who provides most of the inventions and formulas that get the stories started. He is a good friend of the protagonists. * Professor Snuffel: Another genius professor and archeologist, whose personality is mostly similar to Kumulus. In later stories he appears less frequently in favor of Kumulus. * Hilarius Warwinkel: A genius inventor and college friend of Kumulus. However, he suffers from alcoholism, which causes him to make stupid mistakes that bring his inventions into the wrong hands. His appearance was based on Albert Einstein. * Theo Flitser: A sensation-driven young photographer who always searches the latest scoop. Though a friend of Piet and Bert they see him as somewhat of a nuisance, especially Bert because Susan finds Theo attractive. His appearance is based on Pom's own. * Commissaris Knobbel: The head of the local police. He is arrogant, easily agitated and dumb, and disliking Piet and Bert he tends to unjustly jail them. Usually Piet and Bert solve the cases while Knobbel takes all credit for it.

The film was named one of the top 5 documentaries of 1943 by the National Board of Review.National Board of Review Awards for 1943 Retrieved 6 August 2010 It was inspired by the Lidice massacre in Czech Republic in June 1942. Plot The film opens with a title card outlining the story of Lidice. It then moves on to an image of the stream running through the village of Cwmgiedd (half a mile from Ystradgynlais in west Wales), and an eight-minute opening sequence interspersed with images and sounds of everyday life in a community in the Upper Swansea Valley; men are shown working at the colliery, women engaged in domestic tasks in their homes and the inhabitants singing in the Methodist chapel. Most of the dialogue in this section is spoken in Welsh, with no subtitles. The section closes with another title card stating \\"such is life at Cwmgiedd...and such too was life in Lidice until the coming of Fascism\\". The German occupation is heralded by the arrival in the village of a black car, blaring military music and political slogans from its loudhailer. Little is shown of the occupation itself, its violence being implied by a soundtrack of marching boots, gunfire and harshly amplified orders and directives, in the sound-as-narrative technique Jennings had previously developed in Listen to Britain. The identity of the community is eroded, with the Welsh language being suppressed and no longer permitted as the teaching medium in the school, and trade union activity being made illegal. The villagers resistance takes the form of covert activities including the publication of a Welsh news sheet. Eventually, even the singing of Welsh hymns in the chapel is outlawed. The catalyst for the systematic obliteration of Cwmgiedd in a reprisal is intended to parallel the consequence of the actual murder of the leading Nazi Reinhard Heydrich the previous year. The children of the village are marched out of school and join the womenfolk as they are loaded onto trucks. The men, defiantly singing \\"Land of Our Fathers\\" as they go, are lined up against the wall of the village churchyard. Background The murder of Reinhard Heydrich, whose assassination (Operation Anthropoid) by British-trained Czech agents in Prague led to the actual Lidice massacre. The film was designed as a tribute to the mining community of Lidice, Czechoslovakia, which had been the scene of the appalling Nazi atrocity on 10 June 1942 when its entire adult male population (173 men and boys over 16) was executed and all 300 women and children sent to Nazi concentration camps, which few would ultimately survive. News of the massacre caused much shock in the UK, particularly in the coal-mining areas of the country. The film recreates events in Lidice but transports them to a South Wales mining community to indicate that if the German invasion of Britain had been successful in 1940, then the kind of atrocities currently being perpetrated in German-occupied Europe would just as likely be happening contemporaneously in the UK; also as a reminder to the British people of what they were fighting against. Production By August 1942, Jennings was scouting for a filming location in a mining community with both a physical resemblance to Lidice, and a similar social/political history. According to one of the film's actors, Jennings asked the advice of Welsh miners' leader and South Wales Miners' Federation president Arthur Horner as to a suitable location. Horner advised avoiding the coal mining valleys of the Rhondda, and instead investigate the more rural anthracite area of west Wales. Jennings' travels brought him to the town of Ystradgynlais in Brecknockshire, and in particular its self-contained community of Cwmgiedd. Jennings discussed the project with the local mine workers and their families, and found them enthusiastic for the venture. He also gained the co-operation of Arthur Horner, who felt that the proposed film would be symbolic of the unity and solidarity felt by all mining communities with the people of Lidice. Filming began in September 1942 and continued through to December. Jennings had decided that no professional actors would be brought in, and his entire cast consisted of untrained local people, although he was careful to ensure that nobody appeared on screen without giving their permission and that anyone who felt uneasy or uncomfortable about being filmed was excluded from shots. People were filmed going about their actual daily lives in a largely improvised manner with no script having been prepared. In a letter to his wife, he wrote: \\"Down here I‚Äôm working on a reconstruction of the Lidice story in a mining community ‚Äì but more important than that really is being close to the community itself and living and working inside it, for what it is everyday. I really never thought to live and see the honest Christian and Communist principles acted on as a matter of course by a large number of British ‚Äì I won‚Äôt say English ‚Äì people living together.\\"Jackson, Kevin. Humphrey Jennings, Picador London, 2004, p.272 Critical reception On its release, the film gained a reputation as a particularly pertinent, powerful and moving short film. Contemporary opinion places it among the products of Jennings' most fruitful period as a director alongside Listen to Britain, Fires Were Started and A Diary for Timothy.The Silent Village Danks, Adrian. Senses of Cinema. Retrieved 6 August 2010 Dave Berry of the British Film Institute notes: \\"There's a civilised reticence about Jennings' treatment...but overall (he) instinctively finds the right tone. A constant fear of reprisals permeates the film. In domestic scenes, the locals' impassivity, listening to their radios, compounds the sense of oppression. Stilted acting makes its own contribution. There are no glib, articulate spokesmen here and Jennings, using light and shadow well, suggests a stunned community awaiting the decisive blow.\\" In a wider discussion of Welsh industry in film, BBC Wales said: \\"Jennings' penchant for understatement and striking imagery carried its own force ‚Äì and the film, calling for solidarity among miners faced with the German threat to freedom, was instrumental in forging enduringly strong relationships between Czech and Welsh miners, in particular.\\"\\"Industry in Welsh film\\" BBC Wales.

Accessed June 9, 2013.) was a Danish-born American long-distance swimmer who is best known as becoming the seventh person, third American and second woman to successfully swim across the English Channel. Earlier, Corson had completed the swim around Manhattan Island, a distance of 42 miles, and had also completed the swim from Albany, New York to New York City, swimming the distance in a total of 5 days, 3 hours and 11.5 minutes. The straight-line distance between the two points is 143 miles, but Corson swam an extra 10 miles due to various detours. Biography Born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1897. Her father was a physician who was sure that his daughter would become a musician or prima donna, but she was uninterested in piano and voice lessons. She started swimming at age six and rapidly became an expert swimmer and started a school of swimming instruction. Seeking greater opportunities, she came to the United States in 1919. She had much trouble getting established there. Trying to find a notable accomplishment to highlight her background, she asked a man standing on the Harlem River how far she could swim along the shore and he replied that it was between 30 and 40 miles. Not realizing that Manhattan is an island, she made the 42 mile distance in a time of 16 hours.Staff. \\"MRS. CORSON SELF-TRAINED.; She Has Swum Around Manhattan and From Albany to New York.\\", The New York Times, August 29, 1926. Accessed August 6, 2010. Corson had been an instructor for three years at the YWCA in Harlem and then taught swimming to sailors on the USS Illinois battalion armory of the New York Naval Militia, located on the Hudson River at the foot of 96th Street. In preparation for the Channel swim, Corson implemented a plan for daily exercise that she had received from racewalking champion Louis Leibgold, the physical director of the Illinois. She never had a swimming instructor and her preparatory steps for the English Channel swim were based on the guidance of an expert in the Channel's tides and weather conditions. Her next effort was the swim from Albany to New York City, a distance of 143 miles. She needed someone to shadow her in a rowboat while doing the swim, and received a volunteer in the person of Clemington Corson, assistant superintendent of the USS Illinois. She never left the water, but would stop at the nearest town along the shore and then set out again early the next morning. She swam 153 miles on the 143 mile straight-line route and covered the distance in a total of 5 days, 3 hours and 11.5 minutes, including 66 hours of swimming time. Becoming close from their relationship on the Albany-NYC trip she married Corson, and by 1926 she had two children, a two-year-old daughter and a son who was four years old. The children stayed with an aunt in Virginia while Corson worked on her record swims. Her first attempt to make the English Channel crossing came in 1923, when she had made the first 21 miles in 14.5 hours and had reached two miles from the coast of France, but was forced to concede failure after a tide carried her seven miles away from shore. In July 1922, she swam the 22 miles from Dover to Ramsgate in 6 hours and 20 minutes, with an hourly sugar cube providing her with the energy needed for the swim. Her time was only six minutes off the record set by Frank Perks. Leibgold introduced Corson to L. Walter Lissberger, a local businessman with an interest in sports who financed the $3,000 in expenses she and her husband incurred in preparing for the Channel swim. Lissberger made a wager with Lloyd's of London betting that she would succeed in crossing the Channel, and received a payout of $100,000 at odds of 20-1 when she completed her swim. She was one of three swimmers who were trying to make the swim across the Channel at the same time starting at 11:32 at night on August 28, 1926, leaving from Cape Gris Nez. The two men with her failed, Egyptian swimmer Ishak Helmy dropping out after three hours and an English swimmer failing one mile from Dover's Shakespeare Cliffs.Staff. \\"MRS.

Found in Africa, Asia, and Europe, the gong is a slab of rock that is hit like a drum. Other regional names for the rock gong include kungering, kwerent dutse, gwangalan, kungereng, kongworian, and kuge. These names are all onomatop≈ìic, except for \\"kuge\\" which is the Hausa word for a double iron bell and \\"dawal\\" which is the Ge\`ez word for a church's stone gong.  History  Rock gongs have been found in various African locations, such as sites in Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania in Siuyu and Ughaugha,also in Serengeti, (see Itambu, et.al 2018), Uganda, and Zambia. The Kupgal petroglyph site in India, which was originally discovered in 1892 (though lost and rediscovered in the 21st century), includes a large number of rock gongs alongside rock art. The site dates to the Neolithic period. Rock gongs were brought to the attention of the anthropological community in 1956 by archaeologist Bernard Fagg. Fagg identified that the first recorded discovery of rock gongs (or \\"ringing rocks used for the production of musical notes\\") was in Birnin Kudu, Nigeria, in June 1955. He drew a link between the geographic distribution of rock gongs and cave paintings, stating that the gongs' proximity to cave paintings \\"leaves little doubt that they are associated in some way\\".  Description  Rock Gong at Tombos (Nubia) Rock gongs are often large dolerite rocks; Fagg describes examples that weigh up to several tons. They are almost always entirely solid, as playing rocks in other such states would result in a hollow and less metallic tone. Fagg identifies that the tone produced by the vibrating rock is not necessarily influenced by the size of the rock, provided that the resonating stone is not dampened by the solid earth. Rock gongs would be played by striking the rock's surface with a hand-held stone. This beater would often be made of igneous stone, but examples of metamorphic quartzite beaters have been discovered. Although often played solo, gongs can be played as an ensemble, with evidence that gongs for four players were sometimes used. These larger stones can have up to 50 tuned depressions. When measured against a Ragg tuning fork, a depression on one particular gong was found to have a fundamental frequency of 216 Hz. Continuous playing of the instrument produces smooth indentations in the rock and a matt-like texture.

In its teaching and research it cooperates closely with the University of Bern.In Bern beliebt - auf der ganzen Welt beachtet It is visited by around 131,000 people yearly. History The museum is owned by the Burgergemeinde of Bern, so it is also known as . It was officially founded in 1832. It is located on Bernastrasse, in the Kirchenfeld quarter, in a building that was erected between 1932 and 1934, opened in 1936 and expanded several times since then. Previously the exhibits were kept in a building on Hodlerstrasse built from 1878‚Äì81 and demolished in 1936; and earlier still, in the library gallery of a former college building. In 2016, the museum was visited by around 131,000 people. Collection The museum is known for its set of over 220 life-sized dioramas, featuring preserved animals from Switzerland, Africa and Asia; it also owns a collection of minerals from the Alpine region, samples of gold discovered at various locations in Switzerland, meteorites, a large stock of invertebrates, and Switzerland's largest collection of animal skeletons and bones. =Mammal dioramas= The museum's panda diorama, located in Asian Mammals. The tiger diorama, located in Asian Mammals The dioramas originate from a collection of big game animals from Africa, bagged by the London-based Bernese painter and game hunter Bernhard von Wattenwyl (together with his daughter Vivienne) during an expedition in 1923‚Äì24. A total of 130 of these animals are on display, in 33 dioramas along two darkened corridors. The dioramas are designed and furnished according to the animals' natural habitat. There is a further section displaying native birds and mammals, with over 600 animals in 164 dioramas. This section was previously on display in the Heimatmuseum, opened around the outbreak of World War II. The upper basement contains five dioramas of Asian animals threatened with extinction: snow leopards, orangutans, giant pandas, Indian rhinoceroses, and tigers. A fourth section called \\"Nordic Animals\\" features stuffed bears, muskoxen, seals, moose and birds, in nine dioramas containing 66 individual animals. One of the museum's biggest attractions is the stuffed hide of Barry, the St. Bernard who is said to have saved the lives of over 40 people. A special exhibit dedicated to him was held in 2001.  The museum's largest exhibit draws on the four million items to explore the biological and psychological facets of live. Visitors are invited to use sight, smell and sound to discover the world's tremendous biodiversity and its greater implications in human existence. Films, tactile and audio installations attempt to not only present scientific answers to these basic questions, but illustrate philosophy into the metaphysics of studying life. The exhibit's first section repeats the phrase \\"There is no life without death.\\" Part of the exhibition's definition of life is that all living things die, and through their decomposition stimulate more life. This section presents the life inside a pig carcass (paradisaically living off of the pig's demise), the oldest living animal (the Antarctic glass sponge) and the human fascination with death (featuring many art installations including H.R. Geiger's original mask for the film Alien.) The museum is, in essence, a repository for dead animals, and this section pays homage to their collectors and exhibits. Visitors look onto treasures through a transparent floor in somewhat of a meta-mission: the museum too was founded on a fascination with the death of the world around us. The second section discusses gender and sexuality. Thus, the exhibit expands its definition to note that all living things must reproduce and pass along their traits. Avian mating displays show the advantages and disadvantages of this system: the decorated male bird may attract predators as well as an appreciative female and his elaborate plumage may make it hard to fly. Over in the corner, a life- sized blue whale head and an oversized sea turtle represent r/K selection theory. This cycle of risk and benefit hinders even human childbirth. Larger brains give humans a clear advantage, but complicate biophysical matters with an enlarged braincase. The \\"World in the Head\\" section looks at the senses, the brain and the idea of consciousness. A Gertrude Stein quote and small animatronic display illustrates the senses that humans do not have. A mirrored room metaphorically takes the visitor into an infinity and asks if vision requires an infinite amount of brain activity.  The largest collection of animal skeletons and bones in Switzerland is displayed under the name \\"The Big Bone Show\\" ().Die grosse Knochenschau Online magazine of the University of Bern, 31 May 2005. This room exhibits over 300 skeletons, including those of a fin whale and an Asian elephant. Eight of the larger skeletons sit upon a continually revolving carousel. The display cabinets contain numerous further exhibits, including 518 individual bones. =Albert Heim Foundation= The Albert Heim Foundation for the promotion of cynological research is based at the museum, and possesses the world's largest collection of canine skulls.Albert-Heim-Stiftung - Aktuelles Albert Heim Foundation website.

He fought 54 times between 1975 and 1982; winning 39 (24 by knockout), losing 13 and drawing 2. The highlight of Lastra's career came in 1977 when he won the WBA world featherweight title against Rafael Ortega. During his career he also became the Spanish champion and twice challenged for the EBU title. Professional career Lastra made his professional debut at the age of 24, with a six round points victory against Juan Barros in December 1975. As with the majority of his early fights, the bout took place in his hometown of Santander. Lastra won the first twelve fights of his career, including six first round knockouts, before losing for the first time, in September 1976, against Carlos Hernandez. Following this defeat, Lastra won eight successive fights in Santander, before beating Isidoro Cabeza for the Spanish featherweight title. He suffered his first knockout defeat in August 1977, losing in the eleventh round against Roberto Castanon in his first title defence. In December 1977 Lastra challenged Rafael Ortega for the WBA featherweight title in front of an estimated crowd of 6,300 in Santander. Ortega, a Panamanian who had won the title earlier in the year, was knocked down in the second round after a left jab to the nose. The champion rose from the canvas at the count of eight and lasted the full fifteen rounds. At the end of the contest the scorecards revealed a split decision in Lastra's favour. For the first defence of his title Lastra travelled to Panama City to fight Eusebio Pedroza in April 1978. The 22-year- old challenger knocked Lastra down three times en route to a thirteenth-round technical knockout victory. Although Lastra never fought for a world title again, he twice challenged Roberto Castanon for the EBU title; losing the first fight on points and the second by a fourth round technical knockout. After four losses in a row, including two Spanish title fights, Lastra fought for a final time in July 1982, losing in the fifth round against Amalio Galan.

Dated 1583 it bears initials TF and MF, for Thomas Fane and his wife Mary Neville. Note how it shows the original Fane crest According to tradition, and to the Heraldic Visitation of Kent 1574, the Fane/Vane family was descended from Captain Sir John Fane (or Ivon Vane as he was also known), a Welsh gentleman who captured King John II of France at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 and received a share of the huge ransom money, which took the French people eight years to raise. His descendants, the families of Fane (Earl of Westmorland) and Vane (Marquess of Londonderry), use for their heraldic crests a golden gauntlet which was awarded him at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356, and also three golden gauntlets in their coat of arms. However, according to The Complete Peerage (1959)Cokayne, G. E., Geoffrey H. White, ed. (1959). The Complete Peerage, or a history of the House of Lords and all its members from the earliest times, volume XII part 2: Tracton to Zouche. 12.2 (2nd ed.).

Complete Peerage also states that \\"the long line of Welsh descent, as given in the Heraldic Visitation of Kent 1574, is spurious\\" and their source (Fane (1897)) states it to be \\"rendered so doubtful by negative evidence as to be no longer capable of support\\".1574 Welsh pedigree of Fane, according to Fane, W.V.R: p.85 However Keith W. Murray (1897), published in the same source as Fane (1897)The Welsh Descent of the Fane Family, in the Geneaologist Magazine, New Series, Vol xiii, London, 1897, pp.209-213 vindicates the Welsh pedigree and severely criticises the methodology of Fane (1897), followed by Complete Peerage. Career After an education at Maidstone Grammar School Fane, who was a committed Protestant, was convicted of treason in 1554 for his involvement in Wyatt's rebellion and was sentenced to death. After four months of imprisonment in the Tower of London he was pardoned by Queen Mary on account of his youth and on the condition that he took the Oath of Loyalty. Fane went on to serve as High Sheriff of Kent in 1572 and in 1573 was knighted for services to the crown. A monument to Fane survives in St Lawrence's Church, Mereworth, Kent. Marriages and children He married twice: *Firstly to Elizabeth Culpepper who died in child-birth; *Secondly to Mary Neville, Baroness le Despencer, daughter and heiress of Henry Nevill, 6th Baron Bergavenny by his wife Frances Manners a daughter of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland. Mary Neville was a great heiress, the last one of the House of Neville, and was one of England's largest landowners. Mary Neville inherited suo jure the titles of Baron le Despenser and Baron Bergavenny from her father. The Barony of le Despenser was called out of abeyance in 1604 in her favour and accordingly she became 3rd Baroness le Despenser. She was also, by modern doctrine, 7th and 5th Baroness Bergavenny, having inherited the senior two Baronies of Bergavenny from her father on his death, as well as his estates in Kent centred on Mereworth Castle. Her son was granted the title Earl of Westmorland when he was raised to that rank by King James I. The original Neville Earldom of Westmoreland had been confiscated in 1571 from Mary Neville's cousin Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland due to his participation in the Rising of the North.

Habitat and ecology Atractaspis aterrima occurs in a wide range of habitats: coastal grasslands, dry and moist savannas, and forests. It is fossorial. Based on gut contents of a single snake, the prey include caecilian Scolecomorphus kirkii and lizards (an unidentified tail). The snake in question was in total length, whereas the caecilian was comparatively large at total length‚Äîan earlier study had indicated that A. aterrima eats smaller prey. However, this observation otherwise agrees with earlier ones for A. aterrima and other Atractaspis species, documenting that they eat elongated vertebrates (snakes, amphisbaenians, skinks, and geckos), some of these fossorial.

Evolving from both the Remount Service of the Quartermaster Corps and a general horse-breeding program under the control of the Department of Agriculture, the Remount Service began systematically breeding horses for the United States Cavalry in 1918. It remained in operation until 1948, when all animal-breeding programs returned to Department of Agriculture control.  Early history  Giesboro Point Remount station depot headquarters and stables, Washington, DC, circa 1865 The Remount Service had its roots in the expansion of the Union Army during the first days of the Civil War. It was determined that the Federal Government would provide horses for all cavalry and artillery units. This was in direct contrast to the Confederate practice of making each cavalry trooper provide his own horse. Once implemented, the existing system of regimental purchasing boards was quickly overwhelmed and unsuited for dealing with newly raised regiments. In response, the Quartermaster Corps created two different organizations, one for field artillery and another for cavalry, to purchase the large number of horses needed to equip both Regular Army units and state-raised volunteer units. The Quartermaster General's Office oversaw the purchase of draft horses and mules, while the newly created Cavalry Bureau did the same for all cavalry remounts.Cederwald, Major A.A. \\"The Remount Service Past and Present.\\" The Quartermaster Review, Nov-Dec 1928. The new Cavalry Bureau encountered a number of problems from the very beginning. Inadequate staff, poor leadership, and corruption on the part of many horse dealers and buyers combined to halt the flow of remounts to regiments. Command stability was a major issue. During the almost nine months of its existence (late July 1863 through mid-April 1864), the Bureau had no fewer than four commanders.Stephen Z. Starr. The Union Cavalry in the Civil War Vol. II: The War in the East from Gettysburg to Appomattox 1863-1865. Louisiana State University Press, 1981. pp 4-5. Of those four, only James H. Wilson could be considered successful‚Äîand he held the office for less than 60 days. The first commander, General George Stoneman, had led the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac prior to his posting. General Kenner Garrard, his successor, \\"held the post for less than a month.\\"Starr, 5-6. There was also confusion as to the role of the Bureau when it came to training horses, providing cavalry equipment, and serving as rest and recuperation points for horses turned in as unserviceable. Many problems were never resolved before the end of the war because the Cavalry Bureau had ceased functioning in a real sense before 1865. By mid-April 1864, the Quartermaster's Department regained control of horse purchasing for cavalry, while the Bureau's equipment procurement and inspection duties fell to \\"a cavalry officer especially assigned to that duty\\". That officer, in turn, reported to General Halleck, who assumed \\"the duties of chief of the Cavalry Bureau\\".Starr, 131. The Army's first experiment with centralized purchasing and organization for cavalry forces ended before the conclusion of the Civil War. In spite of its many organizational challenges, leadership issues, and brief existence, the Cavalry Bureau is noteworthy for what it did accomplish. Central remount depots were established at Giesboro Point, near Washington DC, and near Saint Louis, Missouri. Intended to serve mounted regiments in the Eastern and Western theaters of the War, respectively, the depots were supplied with horses purchased at markets in nine major locations. Each depot could handle between 10,000 and 16,000 horses, with General Stoneman suggesting the construction of a third depot during his time as Bureau commander.Starr, 7.  After the Civil War  Horse Cavalry detachment of the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry, demonstrating equipment and tactics of the 1880s Although the Cavalry Bureau ceased to function before the end of the War, the need for remounts did not end with Lee's surrender in 1865. With 10 cavalry regiments in the Regular Army, the decision was made to return to the contract system to obtain remounts. The Quartermaster's Department conducted the actual purchasing. Although required by Army Regulations, this system did little to remove the dual problems of quality control and corruption.Revised United States Army Regulations of 1861. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1863. p. 155. This system remained in use throughout much of time prior to the Remount Service, as documented on p. 190 of the Regulations for the Army of the United States published in 1911. During the Indian Wars period, this often took the form of boards of officers who traveled to various horse markets and made purchases on a local level after inspecting the stock on hand.Annual Report of the Quartermaster-General to the Secretary of War for the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 1874. Washington, DC: 1874. p. 82.  The 20th century  Henry of Navarre, a Thoroughbred race horse after retirement to stud with the Army Remount Service, 1917 Veterinary hospital at Fort Robinson, built 1909 Fort Reno, Oklahoma in 1908. Although the need for some sort of remount bureau or office had been recognized since the end of the Civil War, formal steps were not taken, or funding made available, until the first decade of the 20th century. In 1908, the Remount Service was officially activated as part of the Quartermaster Corps with Purchasing Boards set up in Boise, Idaho; Front Royal, Virginia; Lexington, Kentucky; Sheridan, Wyoming; San Angelo, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Sacramento, California. These Boards were intended to take the place of the earlier regimental boards. In May of the same year, the Quartermaster Corps took the next logical step and set up the Fort Reno Quartermaster Depot as a \\"processing/distribution center for military horses and mules\\".Phil Livingston and Ed Roberts. War Horse: Mounting the Cavalry with America's Finest Horses. Bright Sky Press, 2003. p. 267 There was also a determined attempt to engage professional horse breeders in the Remount Service, beginning in 1918 with the approval of a breeding plan for cavalry horses that combined the efforts of the Remount Service with the Bureau of Animal Industry.Cederwald. A 1921 issue of the Cavalry Journal contained an update from the \\"American Remount Association\\" calling for owners of \\"high-class registered Thoroughbreds\\" to add their stallions to the program. The author also mentioned a reduced-cost registry for \\"half-breed\\" Thoroughbreds.Hawkins, C.E. \\"The American Remount Association\\" Cavalry Journal v 30, no 123 (April 1921). pp 192-194. The number of horses involved in the program remained high even into the final years of the Remount Service. As late as 1945, between 450 and 500 stallions owned by the government and over 11,000 civilian-owned mares produced 7,293 foals. Miller, Everett. United States Army Veterinary Service in World War II. pp 512-513. Accessed online June 21, 2012 Thoroughbreds predominated in the stallion rolls, although a few Morgans, Arabians, and Standardbreds were also used. The number of Arabian stallions increased greatly in 1943 with the addition of the Kellogg Arabian Ranch (renamed the Pomona Remount Depot) to the program.Miller, Everett. United States Army Veterinary Service in World War II. pp 512-513. Online June 21, 2012 In 1942, the Remount Service (then called the Remount Division) printed a breakdown of its breeding program in the Cavalry Journal. According to the article, the primary breeding horse was the Thoroughbred (17,983 mares and 688 stallions), followed by Arabians (375 mares and 16 stallions), followed by Morgans, Saddlebreds, Anglo-Arabians, and the Cleveland Bay (trailing with eight mares and one stallion). Of the foals born in 1941, 11,028 of the 11,409 reported were Thoroughbreds.\\"Army Horse Breeding Program Progresses.\\" Cavalry Journal July-August 1942, p. 76.  List of remount depots and areas Camp Plauche Animal Remount Station, Louisiana, 1944 As noted above, the location of both remount depots and areas changed over time, expanding and contracting based on the needs of the Army and general development of the system.

These areas served to control both the breeding programs and purchasing functions of the Remount Service and worked in conjunction with the depots. The Areas had headquarters at Front Royal (Virginia), Lexington (Kentucky), Colorado Springs (Colorado), Sheridan (Wyoming), San Angelo (Texas), and Pomona Quartermaster Depot (California).Waller, Anna.

It was written by Bryan Elsley and directed by Minkie Spiro Michelle at e4.com/skins It premiered on E4 on 8 March 2007. skins at imdb It is told from the point of view of main character Michelle Richardson. Plot Michelle angrily watches Tony and Maxxie hang out together on the Green as if none of the events of the previous episode happened. She breaks up with Tony for not confessing to cheating on her. Jal attempts to comfort her and Maxxie attempts to apologise, but Michelle insists on being alone. Despite their huge argument, Tony is confident that Michelle will eventually forgive him. Later, Angie attempts to avoid Chris by hiding in the broom cupboard where she finds Michelle, drunk on vodka. The two have coffee and Michelle confides in her about her woes. Chris finds them and Angie agrees to give them both a ride home. After dropping off Michelle, Angie attempts to end her affair with Chris but they end up having sex in her car. At Michelle's home, there is little sympathy for her breakup‚Äîher mother, Anna, dismisses her problems while her stepfather, Malcolm, criticizes Michelle. At school, Tony reads aloud an essay about the role of sex in relationships, embarrassing Michelle. Angie berates him for his cruelty and Maxxie confesses to the group that Tony performed fellatio on him on the Russia trip. Jal informs Michelle about Tony's various flings with other girls during their relationship, including with Abigail Stock. Michelle picks a fight with Abigail in front of her friends, but Abigail's brother, Josh, breaks up the fight. He takes an interest in Michelle but she attempts to use Sid as a rebound instead. However, Sid realizes he cannot have sex with Michelle because he is in love with Cassie. Sid's father walks in on them in hugging on the bed together and is pleased to see that Sid is not gay. He and Michelle go to visit Cassie at the psychiatric hospital, but he is dismayed to find out that Cassie has a new boyfriend and is now celibate. At the hospital, Michelle runs into Josh and he asks her out. Michelle happily accepts, but her happiness is short lived when she gets into another argument at home with her stepfather. On her date with Josh, Michelle learns that he is mentally unstable and is on mood stabilisers. However, she has sex with him and excitedly makes plans to see him again. Back at home, Michelle finds Malcolm preparing to leave her mother and cynically notes that it is her mother's shortest marriage yet. Meanwhile, Tony finally realises Michelle is moving on from him and devises a plan to win her back. He meets up with Abigail and convinces her to let him take nude photos of her. He then has a friend steal Josh's mobile phone. Tony then uploads the nude photos onto it and sends the photos to Josh's contact list, including Michelle. Michelle is horrified and dumps Josh because she believes he is too crazy to date. Back at home, she finds her mother sobbing over Malcolm's desertion and comforts her. To cheer herself up over Josh, Michelle and Jal head to the bars together where they bump into Malcolm. He admits that he is contemplating returning and Michelle encourages him to do so and offers him some advice. At her house, Michelle bumps into Tony, who tells her he is sorry and that he loves her. He begs her to take him back and promises to change. Though she forgives him, she firmly refuses to take him back, saying she'll 'see him around'.

Michelle and Malcolm do not get on well. She is irritated by his childish mannerisms, such as slurping milk from his breakfast cereal. He and Anna bicker often and he criticises her about her \\"big arse\\". Michelle's mother, Anna is often too busy to listen to Michelle; their relationship seems relatively good, but they argue over Anna's choice in husbands. Michelle's series two feature will focus more significantly on her relationship with her father, who is unseen in this episode. Tony and Michelle break up in this episode, which leads to the group isolating Tony in favour of Michelle in the next episode.

The SPWC was best known for three programs: a literary magazine, The Journal of Wild Culture; artist-guided walks, \\"landscape readings\\"; and a series of cabarets, The Caf√© of Wild Culture. The organization was a unique hybrid. The oxymoron \\"wild culture\\" tweaked the interest of contrasting types: artists, scientists and activists, and the efforts made by the organization to develop creative projects and discourse around the term were well received. It was concurrently accepted as an arts organization by artists and an environmental organization by environmentalists. The organisation was resurrected in 2011 and is now producing an online magazine based in London and Toronto.  Art and ecology  The style of the organization was determined by how participating artists expressed themselves around the undefined idea of \\"wild culture\\" (also see \\"wildculture\\"). While calling for new articulations of wild culture through its projects, at its height the society filled the cultural vacuum in Toronto with an eclectic kind of \\"thinking man's\\" fun and provided a forum for experimentation amongst performance artists.Metropolis, March 30, 1989, Donna Lypchuk, \\"Mock on the Wild Side\\". The broader public was encouraged by the SPWC to engage with questions about nature and art, while frequently congregating in the outdoors. This audience was also attracted to the organization's ability to 'soft pedal doom and gloom while partying for the planet\\".Toronto Star, April 20, 1990, Vit Wagner, \\"Wild Culture artists party for the planet\\"., p. D1. During a landscape reading on the aboriginal history of downtown Toronto, poet M. T. Kelly offered a view of how the SPWC sought to affect its audience: \\"There is a bridge between history and landscape. To get people to change their view of the environment, you can't just argue in economic terms. It's an emotional thing. People act politically when they get emotionally involved\\".Globe and Mail, Sept 7, 1988, June Callwood, 'sunday morning landscape readings cultivate food for thought\\"., p. A2. The notion of \\"wild culture\\" grew out of multidisciplinary artist Whitney Smith's experience of \\"a spiritual updraft in the art spheres\\" while foraging wild foods in the Ontario forest that he sold to local chefs. From 1982 to 1985 a series of three performances, \\"Fern Policy\\", explored the possibilities of artistic growth in the nature-culture ecotone. In May 1985 Smith made the first public announcement on the formation of the society at a Toronto art event, \\"L'Affaire 'Pataphysique\\", that presented examples of 'pataphysics by local artists parodying theory and methods of modern science. Following this event Smith began recruiting artists to help develop The Journal of Wild Culture.  Defining wild culture  Though there were attempts by the organization to define \\"wild culture\\", there was never an accepted definition. Smith preferred his colleagues and audiences to find wild culture's meaning through the titles of the projects in which it appeared, where the social context was at play; that is, that there existed a serious-sounding and possibly genuine academic journal published by a preserving society with a long name, all devoted to a subject no one knew anything about.Toronto Star, April 20, 1990, Vit Wagner, \\"Wild Culture artists party for the planet\\"., p. D2. Negotiating the serious and the non-serious in a way that made sense and entertained became part of the artists' work. Before there was Smith's recent definition of wild culture (\\"the articulated ecotone between what humans do and what they can't control in nature\\"), no single explanation existed around which the S.P.W.C artists\\" work was done. Some said that it was the vagueness of the idea, the inability to pin it down, that made it so attractive. In the absence of concrete description, Smith offered a metaphor, which he has recently modified: On the surface of a transparent painting is the human geographic reality that is part of our everyday life, and in the background are elements of nature, seen and unseen, that are very much alive but that people aren\\"t always aware of, whether out of convenience, ignorance, apathy, or any state of unconsciousness or self-centeredness that contributes to the disconnection from our primal history and our present psychic hold on the home terrain. Wild culture is the two planes, foreground and background, seen together.  Programs  = The Journal of Wild Culture = The literary organ of the SPWC, its subtitle, ecology, and imagination, spoke to the notion of The Journal of Wild Culture being a platform for artists to express themselves through the lens, or mirror, of the natural world. Smith said that \\"one of the things wild culture is, is a tolerance for ambiguity and an acceptance that things cannot be defined\\".NOW Magazine, July 9‚Äì15, 1987, Ted Mumford, 'society mines wild culture\\". The \\"quirky and innovative\\" magazine carried on its discourse in a way that influenced the way more serious themes could be delivered with a sense of play and timeliness.Ryerson Review of Journalism, April 1991, Megan Park, \\"Call of the Wild\\", p. 52.  Organic start  Born out of the wild foods foraging of founder Whitney Smith, the magazine was conceived in 1986-1987 by an editorial team that included Smith and architect Peter Ferguson, public relations consultant Kim Obrist and filmmaker and publisher Christopher Lowry. Smith attributed his inspiration for the formation of the society to the National Geographic Society (which published its own journal) and FILE magazine, produced by the conceptual and media-based art collective, General Idea, and to the Utne Reader's use of other published materials. The SPWC was in production in Toronto from 1986 to 1991. Graphic designer Bernard Stockl became the art director and quickly established the look of the magazine, including the characteristic contents page. Smith and Lowry assembled a photocopied \\"Journal of Wild Culture\\" Preview Issue that was circulated in the arts community, and a donation of $5000 \\"from an anonymous angel\\" followed, just enough to pay for the printing of the first issue.  Recruitment through social events  The premier issue was launched on July 27, 1987 at the Wild Culture Hoedown on Toronto Island. It was described by Smith at the time as \\"a cross between a literary journal and an arty comic book with ecology as its theme\\".Toronto Sun, July 24, 1987, Marion Kane, \\"Get Down at Wild Culture Hoedown\\"., p. 62. Future Wild Culture events followed the format and spirit of the Hoedown by offering down-home high-end cuisine using wild foods and made on site by Chris Klugman, a well-known local chef, and featuring artists whose personae related to nature themes: the Marquis de Sod and Mr. Potatohead were the guests of honour at the launch. Poet Christopher Dewdney, an early contributor to the magazine, said that \\"half of the experience at \\"The Journal of Wild Culture\\" is the parties.) Volume I, Number 1 was sold for $3.95 and 3000 copies were widely distributed in Canada by Disticor, and the issue sold out; later distribution of increased numbers went into the U.S. It developed a small but devoted fan base, particularly in British Columbia. In 1990 its southwestern U.S. distributor reported that the magazine had \\"a cult following in Texas\\".  Visual language  Smith said that Stockl, who died of AIDS-related causes in 1992, was a significant contributor to JWC. \\"Bernie's deep sense of graphic taste and design intelligence struck the right tone with the first issue: serious like an academic journal but also accessible and visually engaging. In order for the quirkiness to work we needed the credible and elegant look that his gave us\\". Stockl said he modeled the JWC design after \\"Harper's\\" and \\"Arts and Architecture\\": \\"The trick was to create certain effects with what was available to us. Trying to cheat our way through it without it looking like that\\". The Bernard Franklin Stockl Memorial Scholarship is offered annually at the Alberta College of Design for \\"creative and innovative exploration in the use of typography for the purpose of communication\\".  Difficulties and demise  In the late 1980s, when advertisers were slow to embrace the few existing green magazines, and particularly one which the Utne Reader editor, Eric Utne, called \\"indescribable\\", low ad sales made it difficult to pay the bills and meet that quarterly schedule; only seven issues were published. Two Wild Culture auctions and funding from the federal and provincials arts councils helped take up the slack, but with a low subscription base and advertising revenue, a sudden drop in grant revenue, fund-raising and marketing fatigue, Smith's reluctance to step into the role of \\"a career publisher\\",Ryerson Review of Journalism, April 1991, Megan Park, \\"Call of the Wild\\", p. 57. the magazine decided to take a sabbatical. More recently Smith commented on his own burn-out keeping the magazine and the SPWC going, the dilemma of the artist-publisher, and the difficulty of keeping cultural magazines afloat in factors relating to demise of JWC. In early 1991, on CBC radio's \\"Arts Report\\", it was announced that the magazine was suspending publication. The plan was to pursue a more economically feasible course by following the format of Granta magazine, offering it as a trade paperback available in bookstores. A pilot issue of selections from past JWC issues was put out by Somerville House in 1992, Wild Culture, edited by Smith and Lowry, but sales were not encouraging; one explanation for this was that the book did not offer new material. An attempt by Smith and some new colleagues in 2002 to resurrect the Journal of Wild Culture online never got off the ground. Smith said that wild culture was \\"a notion with a mind of its own\\" and that \\"the ingredients for a re-launch in 2002 just weren't there\\". = Landscape Readings = Landscape Readings were public walking tours led by artists of outdoor environments that held an intellectual or personal interest for the artist. Landscape Readings were a hybrid that combined the attraction of authors reading their own works with a bracing picnic outing in a setting which combines the context for a lecture on ecology, geology, history or biography. The readings were a project initially conceived by Smith to provide a venue for writer and poet Christopher Dewdney to share his extensive knowledge of palaeozoic geology, among other things, and his sense of humour. In July 1987 he gave the first landscape reading of Toronto's High Park Carolinian forest,NOW Magazine, July 9‚Äì15, 1987, Ted Mumford, 'society mines wild culture,\\" p. ?. which was documented in the forthcoming issue of The Journal of Wild Culture.Christopher Dewdney, photos by David Hlynsky, Fall 1987, \\"Evidence Revealed During Walk in Park\\", The Journal of Wild Culture, Vol. I, No. 3., p. 40-43. Other artist guides included Gordon Rayner, Hank Hedges, M. T. Kelly, June Callwood, Larry Zolf, Joyce Weiland, and architect Donald Schmitt. The Readings were created to \\"give [SPWC participating] artists a new venue\\". = The Caf√© of Wild Culture = The Caf√© of Wild Culture was conceived in collaboration with bookseller and film programmer Marc Glassman, who recognized that the sense of humour that was so much a part of the 60s and 70s was missing in the 80s.Toronto Star, February 4, 1989, Ingrid Hamilton, \\"Scene and Heard\\", p. 41. The Caf√© was performed first in Toronto at The Rivoli, and later in New York at the Village Gate and at Goddard College in Vermont. Its legitimate non-theatre style played off the vaudeville and variety revue made up of several short unrelated acts (in the Caf√©'s case, no longer than 7 minutes) that caught the wild culture spirit of thoughtful irreverence. Acts ranged from tendentious 'pataphysical lectures, authentic scientific explanations, obtuse dance works, gentlemen's shirt- ironing contests, and wild food cooking demonstrations, in which small servings were provided for the audience, and a game called StorySlide where artists improvised a performed text based on a random photographic slide show. = Other programs = Smith met his match when he began a project called the Great Festival of the Lakes, which was to encourage the presentation of community arts festivals in Great Lakes cities. \\"I was very concerned about water quality issues at the time, and thought that the SPWC needed an activist project to sponsor. I was wrong. Organizing anything around the Great Lakes is like trying to organize Europe. I learned a lot about underestimating scale on that one, and spreading myself too thin\\". The project was abandoned after a couple of years. In 1990, the SPWC worked with an organization started by Michael Stadtlander and Jamie Kennedy, Knives and Forks, on Spring Feast, which became a precursor of future events promoting local chefs and wild and organic foods.  The Journal of Wild Culture 2.0  From September 2011 Smith's work on the SPWC focused on the online publishing platform, The Journal of Wild Culture. The project was beta-launched in December 2012 in London as www.wildculture.com by an editorial and design team including Smith, Joe Hedges of Branding by Garden, Tom Jeffreys, Sarah Lester, Rosie Jackson and Liam Desroy, continued with Smith, Jeffreys and designer Hedges from February to October 2013, at which time Smith took over sole editorial responsibilities, in collaboration, until 2016, with board members Lisa Wilson and Richard Stursberg; Stursberg continues to participate in an advisory role. The publication has no advertising, sends out a weekly newsletter, is supported by donations and the work of a growing community of international contributors. Current editors and contributing editors under publisher/editor Smith include Chellis Glendinning, Herbert Wright, Chris Lowry, Henry Giroux and illustrator Brad Harley.

The project features vocalist Michael Kiske (Helloween, Unisonic, Place Vendome) collaborating with American singer Amanda Somerville (Aina, HDK, Trillium, Epica). The project has released the debut album Kiske/Somerville on September 24, 2010 and the second album, City of Heroes on April 17, 2015. Biography Michael Kiske is a German singer best known for his early work with the German power metal band Helloween. He is the vocalist of the hard rock/heavy metal band Unisonic and has released several solo albums. Kiske has participated on various projects such as Place Vendome and Avantasia and has also recorded guest vocals for numerous rock and metal bands. Amanda Somerville is an American singer-songwriter and vocal coach who works mostly in Germany and was involved in many productions of German producers Sascha Paeth and Miro. Amanda is the vocalist of the band Trillium and provides vocals for the project HDK. She is featured on the symphonic metal project Aina and has also recorded guest vocals for the band Kamelot. In late 2009, Serafino Perugino (president of the Italian record label Frontiers Records) hired Mat Sinner (Sinner, Primal Fear) and Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear) to provide the songwriting for a duet project between Michael Kiske and Amanda Somerville. The majority of the songwriting for the debut album of the Kiske/Somerville project was supplied by Sinner and Karlsson, with further input from Sander Gommans (After Forever) and Amanda Somerville. The aforementioned musicians together with Jimmy Kresic (Voodoo Circle), Martin Schmidt and Ramy Ali also provided the instrumentation for the album. The self-titled debut album was released on September 24, 2010. Two music videos were filmed for the songs \\"Silence\\" and \\"If I Had A Wish\\", enabling most of the participants to actually meet in person. \\"I did a duet with a female singer on \\"Breathe in Water\\" by Indigo Dying. It was so nice that he offered me a chance to make an album of all duet songs with a famous female singer\\", explains Kiske. \\"When Mat Sinner asked me if I wanted to be the 'other half' of the face of the album, I was very honored and quite looking forward to working more closely with Michael Kiske\\" tells Amanda. \\"We‚Äôd both been involved in various projects over the years together, such as Aina and Avantasia, but it was always through third parties and we didn‚Äôt sing together like we do here. It‚Äôs not for nothing that Michael‚Äôs a legend in the scene. He‚Äôs got a very unique voice, a special delivery of his performance and is a wonderful person on top of it all. This has been a great experience all across the board!\\". Kiske adds \\"To sing together with the gifted and beautiful Amanda was another genius idea of Serafino! And it was a most pleasant experience to meet her. Amanda has by far the best female voice I have heard for ages. And the album is a killer.\\" The second Kiske/Somerville album entitled City of Heroes was released on April 17, 2015. The album once again features bassist Mat Sinner in a songwriting partnership with guitarist Magnus Karlsson, with one song written by Amanda Somerville and Sander Gommans. Karlsson is also in charge of the keyboards, while Veronika Lukesova is the drummer on the album. Two music videos were filmed for the songs \\"City Of Heroes\\" and \\"Walk On Water\\".

Formulation Let M be a closed, oriented manifold of dimension n, and let [M] \\\\in H_n(M) be its orientation class. Here H_n(M) denotes the integral, n-dimensional homology group of M. Any continuous map f\\\\colon M\\\\to X defines an induced homomorphism f_*\\\\colon H_n(M)\\\\to H_n(X). A homology class of H_n(X) is called realisable if it is of the form f_*[M] where [M] \\\\in H_n(M). The Steenrod problem is concerned with describing the realisable homology classes of H_n(X). Results All elements of H_k(X) are realisable by smooth manifolds provided k\\\\le 6. Any elements of H_n(X) are realisable by a mapping of a Poincar√© complex provided n e 3. Moreover, any cycle can be realized by the mapping of a pseudo-manifold. The assumption that M be orientable can be relaxed. In the case of non-orientable manifolds, every homology class of H_n(X,\\\\Z_2), where \\\\Z_2 denotes the integers modulo 2, can be realized by a non-oriented manifold, f\\\\colon M^n\\\\to X. Conclusions For smooth manifolds M the problem reduces to finding the form of the homomorphism \\\\Omega_n(X) \\\\to H_n(X), where \\\\Omega_n(X) is the oriented bordism group of X. The connection between the bordism groups \\\\Omega_* and the Thom spaces MSO(k) clarified the Steenrod problem by reducing it to the study of the homomorphisms H_*(\\\\operatorname{MSO}(k)) \\\\to H_*(X). In his landmark paper from 1954, Ren√© Thom produced an example of a non- realisable class, [M] \\\\in H_7(X), where M is the Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space K(\\\\Z_3\\\\oplus \\\\Z_3,1).

Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., Seventh Series 12: 350-354. (Miodon christyi, new species, p. 354).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Polemon christyi, p. 54). Geographic range Distribution of Polemon christyi include Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and western Kenya. The status of observations from Rwanda and Malawi is uncertain, whereas observations from Tanzania, Zambia, and possibly Burundi likely refer to Polemon ater described in 2019. Description The dorsum of the body of P. christyi is black. The ventral surface of the head is also black. The ventrals and subcaudals are white, broadly margined with black. The type specimen, a female, is in total length, which includes a tail long. The dorsal scales are smooth, without apical pits, and are arranged in 15 rows at midbody. The ventrals number 209. The anal plate is divided. The subcaudals number 20, also divided. The diameter of the eye is three fifths its distance from the mouth. The rostral is higher than wide, barely visible from above. The internasals are slightly shorter than the prefrontals. The frontal is slightly longer than broad, much broader than the supraoculars, as long as its distance from the rostral, much shorter than the parietals. The nasal is entire, in contact with the preocular. There are two postoculars. The temporals are 1+1. There are seven upper labials, the third and fourth entering the eye. There are four lower labials in contact with the anterior chin shield, the first lower labial forming a suture with its fellow behind the mental. There are two pairs of chin shields, the anterior pair larger than the posterior pair.

The resolution did not define terrorism, but unlike other previous resolutions, mentioned human rights for the first time. The Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism constituted one of the greatest threats to international peace and security, and was unjustifiable irrespective of the motivation. There was growing concern that nuclear, chemical or biological weapons would be used and sophisticated technology exploited. In this regard, measures to prevent the financing of terrorism had to be strengthened and terrorists had to be prevented from making use of drug trafficking, money laundering, arms trafficking and other crimes. Furthermore, it highlighted the Council's determination to combat such acts through a comprehensive approach involving all nations and organisations in accordance with the United Nations Charter and international law. All states had to comply with resolutions 1373 (2001), 1390 (2002) and 1455 (2003), become party to international conventions on terrorism, assist in terrorist investigations and implement sanctions against Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and their associates reflected in resolutions 1267 (1999), 1390 and 1455. The Council also required that all states bring those who perpetrate, support, finance or plan terrorist actions to justice and to co-operate with the Counter-Terrorism Committee. The adopted declaration also stated that measures taken to combat terrorism had to comply with international law, particularly international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law. Meanwhile, international organisations were to evaluate ways of improving the effectiveness of their actions against terrorism. The Council emphasised efforts to broaden understanding among civilizations and enhance dialogue to prevent the targeting of religions and cultures, concluding by stating its determination to intensify the fight against terrorism.

He was president of the New York City Bar Association from 1900 to 1901. Early life Parsons was born in New York City in 1829 to Edward Lamb and Matilda Parsons. His father was English and his mother was descended from a prominent Wallingford, Connecticut family. He was educated at New York University, where he earned a B.A. in 1848 and an M.A. in 1851. He also received an honorary M.A. from Yale Law School.\\"Parsons, John Edward\\" The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, Vol. XLVII, (1916) and was admitted to the bar in 1851 or 1852.\\"John E. Parsons, Noted Lawyer, Dead\\" New York Times (January 17, 1915) Career Parsons began his legal career as the New York County Assistant District Attorney, where he managed many of the city's prosecutions. This would be the only public position he would hold in his career. He was a founding member, and later president, of the New York City Bar Association and played an important role in the Bar's prosecution of corrupt judges Albert Cardozo, John McCunn, D.P. Ingraham, and George Barnard. Later in his career, he started several practices, ultimately founding the firm Parsons, Closson & McIlvaine in 1902. His largest client was the American Sugar Refining Company, the precursor to the Domino Sugar company. In United States v. E. C. Knight Co., Parsons successfully defended American Sugar Refining from an anti-trust suit by the United States government, preserving its over $90 million in assets.United States v. E. C. Knight Company, 156 U.S. 1, 15 S.Ct 249 (1895) In 1900, Parsons - who had said about trusts \\"I believe in trusts. They are economic necessities calculated to benefit the public\\" - was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in Washington, D.C. for restraint of trade in trying to monopolize the sugar industry. The case did not go to trial until 1912, and a jury could not reach a unanimous decision. =Social life and philanthropy= Parsons was a member of the board of a number of New York cultural institutions, including the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He served as a member of the Council of New York University, appointed in 1867, and for several years president of the NYU Alumni Association. He served as President of Cooper Union from 1905 to 1915.Cooper Union Annual Reports, 1905-1915 He was also a member of a number of gentlemen's clubs, including the University Club of New York, the Century Club, the Players Club and the Metropolitan Club, among others. Personal life He was married twice, first to Mary Dumesnil McIlvaine (1834‚Äì1896), daughter of Bowes Reed McIlvaine and granddaughter of Joseph McIlvaine, U.S. Senator from New Jersey. The Reverend Charles Pettit McIlvaine, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Ohio, was an uncle. His children by his first wife included: * Edith Parsons (1865‚Äì1942), who married David Percy Morgan, the treasurer of American Sugar Refining Company. * Herbert Parsons (1869‚Äì1925), a New York politician who married Elsie Worthington Clews (1875‚Äì1941), a daughter of financier and author Henry Clews. After her death, he was married to Florence Van Corltandt (n√©e Field) Bishop (1851‚Äì1922). Florence, the widow of David Wolfe Bishop, was the daughter of Benjamin Hazard Field, a merchant philanthropist, and the mother of David Wolfe Bishop Jr. and Cortlandt F. Bishop, the pioneer aviator. Parsons had a summer estate called \\"Stoneover\\" in Lenox, Massachusetts, and was a member of both the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York and the Protestant Episcopal Church in Lenox, Parsons died at his residence in New York City, 30 East 36th Street, on January 16, 1915.

Among the original windowpanes is one on which several of Nichols' children incised their names. Built by Thomas and William Nichols, the owner's brothers, the Nichols House soon became the core of Wapakoneta's oldest major residential section. Six other large brick houses were built immediately west of the city center between 1865 and 1875. Like the Nichols House, these structures were erected for prominent members of Wapakoneta society, including its social and political leaders. Since the Nichols family, the house has changed hands very rarely; it had only four owners in its first century. By the late 1970s, it had been purchased by a photographer, who used it for both home and studio. To expand its uses for photography purposes, the house has been slightly modified by the addition of a brick patio and a white picket fence. In recognition of its high quality of preservation, the Nichols House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, because of the significance of its architecture in local history.

It is one of the 26 historical sites that are operated by the Minnesota Historical Society. Located in what is now the city of Mendota, the site consists of four limestone buildings and a large lawn area. Three of the buildings are open for touring, including a fur company cold store from 1843 and the 1840 home of fur trader and hotelier Jean-Baptiste Faribault. The Sibley House The Sibley House, considered the oldest private residence in Minnesota, was built between 1835 and 1836 by a team of over 100 white and Dakota laborers, directed by John Mueller. It was made of limestone blocks cut from a nearby quarry. Sibley lived here as a bachelor for eight years, until his marriage to Sarah Jane Steele. After his marriage, Sibley turned the business office into a parlor, and an addition was built for a kitchen, dining room, two more rooms on the second floor, and an office on the east side. It was in this office that plans were drawn up for the Minnesota Territory, and it became the temporary territorial headquarters in May 1840, when Governor Alexander Ramsey was a guest of Sibley. When General Sibley moved to St. Paul in 1862, he sold his home to St. Peter's Catholic Parish. The Catholic Sisters used the home for a school and convent from 1867 to 1878, adding a belfry on the roof and remodeling the interior. For the next few decades, the house was leased to different parties, including the artist Burt Harwood, as a studio and art school during the summers of 1897-1899. The house was then used briefly as a storehouse, but was soon abandoned and became a lodging place for railroad transients. These new tenants tore up the floorboards and staircases for firewood, and the house fell into ruin. On April 19, 1910, the house was rescued from ruin by a joint effort from the St. Paul chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), Mrs. Lucy Shepard McCourt, and Archbishop John Ireland of St. Peter's Parish. The house was restored by DAR chapters throughout the state, and was opened to the public on June 14, 1910. In May 1997 the DAR turned the ownership of the Sibley Historic Site to State of Minnesota and the management to the Minnesota Historical Society. As of 2015, the historic is operated in partnership with the Dakota County Historical Society. The Faribault House The Faribault House, Mendota, Minnesota Adjoining the Sibley estate is the site of the historic home of Jean Baptiste Faribault, built in 1839. This Colonial house is built of local yellow sandstone with a red sandstone front. Faribault left the house after the death of his wife in 1847, and his grandson George Faribault conducted a hotel in the historic house. River travelers, priests, teachers, explorers, and government representatives all made stays at the inn. The house was sold and rented to various private parties, and eventually fell into disrepair. By the 1880s, Mendota had ceased to be a center of activity and became instead a quiet village. Eventually, the Faribault house was seen as having sufficient historic value to receive government aid in its restoration. In 1934, the State Highway Department began the restoration of the Faribault House through a Public Works Administration project. In 1935, the partially restored home was turned over to the DAR, who completed the restoration. The house and grounds were opened to the public on May 5, 1937. The Dupuis House The Dupuis House On the southeast corner of the historic site is the Dupuis House, built in 1854 for fur trader Hypolite Dupuis, who also served as private secretary to General Sibley for many years. This house is built of brick from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1869 the house was sold to Tim Fee and remained in the Fee family until it was purchased by the Minnesota DAR in 1924. In 1928 the house was remodeled to serve as a tea house. A verandah was built on the east side overlooking an old fashioned garden; and later a large, glass- enclosed porch was added to the west side. The Sibley Tea House became one of Minnesota's most popular tea houses and thousands of guests visited each season until it closed in the 1970s. The Dupuis House now houses the offices of the Sibley Historic Site and the Mendota Mdewakanton Dakota Tribal Community.

Eastham Oil Terminal is situated close to the small town of Eastham on the Wirral Peninsula, beside the Manchester Ship Canal. It was commissioned in 1954 close to the Queen Elizabeth II Dock and is a storage and export facility for oil products refined at Stanlow Refinery, to which it is connected by pipeline. The site is currently operated by Nynas.  History  Construction of the Eastham oil terminal began in 1949 in association with the Queen Elizabeth II Dock. These facilities were built near Eastham locks at entrance of the Manchester Ship Canal on the River Mersey. The new facilities at Eastham provided berthing for large tankers unable to access the ship canal. Pipelines were constructed from Stanlow Oil Refinery to the oil terminal and the dock. The construction cost of the terminal ¬£7 million. The facilities became operational in 1954. Tanker sizes increased rapidly during the 1950s, and as early as 1960 it was recognised that the Eastham terminal was limited as the water there was not deep enough for the 65,000 ton tankers that were then becoming commonplace. This led to the construction of the Tranmere oil terminal further downstream from where crude oil feedstock for Stanlow refinery is offloaded.  Other facilities  Other companies built processing and storage facilities at Eastham. Paktank built a bulk liquid tank farm (53¬∞18'51.5\\"N 2¬∞57'11.2\\"W) to the west of the oil terminal. In 1975 Tate & Lyle had a 50% stake in the terminal. The terminal was later owned and operated by NuStar Terminals Eastham Limited. In 2018 Inter Terminals acquired NuStar‚Äôs European storage terminal business. This facility is currently (2020) operated by Inter Terminals. There are 157 tanks with a total storage capacity of 325,198 m3. There are four jetties for vessels and the terminal receives from, and delivers to, sea and road. In 2015 there was a proposal by Hydrodec Re-refining (UK) Limited to construct a hazardous waste recovery facility at Power House Road, Eastham comprising a waste oil re-refining plant together with associated development. This has not been developed.  Eastham refinery  A small refinery, Eastham Refinery Ltd., was constructed at Eastham in 1966 to the east of the tank farm. This was a joint venture between Tarmac Ltd. and Phillips Petroleum of America (Philips 66) and traded under the name of Philmac Oil Ltd. The refinery took heavy naphthenic crude as a feedstock and produced bitumen and other distillate products such as gas oil, marine diesel, lubricating base stocks. The throughput in the 1970s was 400,000 tonnes per year. In 1989 the unit was expanded to provide a capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per year. Eastham refinery was later operated by Briggs Oil in a joint venture with Shell. Briggs Oil was acquired by the Swedish firm AB Nynas Petroleum in 1992 for ¬£70 million; Shell retained its interest in the plant. In 1992 the refinery comprised a vacuum distillation unit with a capacity of 10,500 barrels/day (1,669 m3/day) producing 8,000 barrels/day (1272 m3/day) of asphalt. The Energy Institute noted that the refinery closed in 2010.Energy Institute, EI Datasheet 07, UK refining distillation capacity, January 2019 However, Eastham Refinery Ltd still operated a bitumen plant in 2017. The plant produces bitumen by a 2-stage distillation process using crude oil and refinery residues as feedstock. Crude oil is received by pipeline from the nearby Tranmere terminal and the residues by pipeline from the Queen Elizabeth II dock. The raw materials and product are stored in a tank farm on the site. In 2015 the plant processed 978,472 tonnes of feedstock oil. The plant uses a combination of an atmospheric distillation column and a vacuum column to separate oil into various final components.

The epithet queletii was given in honour of Lucien Qu√©let. In 1796 Christiaan Hendrik Persoon described a type of bolete under the name Boletus erythropus and in the next 200 years the same name was widely used for a well-known species having red pores. But recently it was discovered that Persoon's mushroom had orange pores, that usage of the name B. erythropus was invalid, and now the red-pored species (after a separate change to the genus too) has to be called Neoboletus luridiformis). It is best not to use the ambiguous name Boletus erythropus any more, but according to Funga Nordica the fungus described by Persoon was actually Suillellus queletii. Description The cap is hemispherical, latter flattening out, appearing olive to reddish-brown, rarely also dark red. The flesh is yellow, turning blue when cut. The pores are initially yellow, soon become orange, and finally can be reddish. The stipe is smooth and golden yellow and the flesh has a slightly acrid taste. The spore powder is olive and under the microscope the spores appear somewhat spindle-shaped and measure about 10-14 ¬µm √ó 5-7 ¬µm.

In 1968, the Auburn City Schools ceased providing regular high school services for the Loachapoka area, and Loachapoka students were bused to Beauregard High School, so that students from the mostly African American Loachapoka area would have an opportunity to attend an integrated high school. Attendance at Beauregard, however, required some students to take round-trip bus rides of up to 96 miles daily; to limit this, the Lee County Schools Board of Education requested to expand the existing Loachapoka Junior High School (grades 7‚Äì10) to a full high school. The federal courts rejected this request to create Loachapoka High four times: in May 1970, July 1970, October 1970, and January 1971, arguing that opening Loachapoka High would \\"substantially decrease the desegregation in the Lee County School System\\".Lee v. Lee County Bd. of Ed, 639 F.2d 1243 (5th Cir. 1981). In October 1971, Lee County Schools again requested to create Loachapoka High, with the courts opposing the request yet again, but allowing that they would reconsider if all of the students in the Loachapoka area were required to attend the school. Auburn High School agreed to stop allowing transfers from the Loachapoka area by 1973 so that Loachapoka High would be allowed to open. In the fall of 1973, Loachapoka High School opened, offering a full high school education in Loachapoka for the first time in decades.

Named after the yellow golden color of its budding leaves and its unique flowery aroma, it is said to be reminiscent of Osmanthus. This oolong is similar to Tieguanyin, with only a little oxidation. Consequently, it has a very flowery, delicate aroma without the astringency of a green tea or the heaviness of a Red/Black Tea. Legends There are two legends behind this tea: the Wang/Marriage legend and the legend of farmer Wei. Both date its origins back to about the mid- nineteenth century. =Wang legend= The first legend is in 1860 that this tea originated from tea seedling given to Lin Ziqin by the bride Wang Dan from her home on their wedding day and planted next to their ancestral temple. The plants that grew were to represent the prosperity of their ancestors and families uniting. As a result, it is often given as a wedding present. The tea produced from these had a unique golden color and fragrance like osmanthus, so named as Huang Dan which has similar pronunciation to Wang Dan according to local language. =Wei legend= The other story is in 1850 that a tea farmer named Wei Zhen was strolling by a brook when he noticed a golden plant on the horizon. As a tea farmer he felt obligated to take a sample and cultivate it. To his surprise it had very powerful fragrance of osmanthus and light yet yellow color liquid remained, so together with neighbors they named it as Huang Dan (\\"Huang\\" is yellow in english while \\"Dan\\" is light). In 1900s tea merchant Lin Jintai got this tea very popular in South East Asia, even as precious as gold, but the old name Huang Dan was not attractive enough, so he changed to Huang Jin Gui(\\"Huang\\" is yellow, \\"Jin\\" is gold while \\"Gui\\" is osmanthus). Mother bush There are two Huang Jin Gui mother bushes corresponding to different legend. One is about Wang legend in Luo Yan village, one is about Wei legend in Mei Zhuang village. According to the government file, Mei Zhuang village was split up from Luo Yan village in 1961. Both locations got big protective change recently. The farm where Wang legend mother bush locate is made into a beautiful park in 2017, the mother bush is protective with introductory text about its story and history.

Life Dinnendahl was the son of a miller. As a youth he worked for two years as a swineherd and then for two years he earned his money selling coal. On the advice of his uncle he learnt to be a carpenter. It was here that his fascination for technology was born. When he received a contract to build a machine house out of wood, he became more interested in the machine than in the house. The first steam engine - conceived in Britain - was employed in the Zeche Vollmond in Bochum-Langendreer. This was built in his first works in the Essener Innenstadt, on the Trentelgasse. Steam engines were to be become extremely important for the extraction of coal in the Ruhr district. They were used, for example, for pumps to extract water from the lower levels. Dinnendahl established his own company and from 1801 to 1803 he constructed the first steam engine of his own construction. In 1807 and 1808, he associated with Friedrich Krupp during the latter's spell as proprietor of the Gute Hoffnungsh√ºtte in Sterkrade. In 1821 his works were burnt down and he built a new factory in Bergerhausen (later: Westfalia-Dinnendahl-Gr√∂ppel AG). Popular legend has it that although he was an excellent engineer, he lacked business qualities such that he died in poverty in 1826. Yet the metal industry in general was experiencing hard times in the period after the end of the Napoleonic Wars and in 1818, Dinnendahl's works was a notable exception in that it showed a modest profit and employed 60 menBlood and Steel - The Rise of the Krupps, Bernhard Menne, page 33 According to some sources,Blood and Steel - The Rise of the Krupps, Bernhard Menne, page 28 he was betrayed by the H√ºtte Gute Hoffnung, who appropriated his expertise and then ruined his business by introducing competition to his business. He was buried in the cemetery in Rellinghausen. In 1936, he was re-interred in an 'Ehrengrab' in the S√ºdwestfriedhof (South West Cemetery). On the grounds of his former works at Trentelgasse 4 in Essen, a main tax office was erected in 1907/08, a memorial plaque was put there in remembrance of him. In 2006, the building was acquired by a private investor erworben, lavishly re-furbished and given the name of \\"Villa Dinnendahl\\". Today a private health academy occupies the building. Dinnendahlstra√üe in Bergerhausen and Huttrop was named for Franz Dinnendahl in 1920. Elsewhere, the Franz-Dinnendahl-Realschule (school) in Essen-Kray bears his name.

It is the site of the city's earliest settlement and the heart of Downtown Newark that at one time was considered the busiest intersection in the United States. The area that radiates 22 square blocks from the crossroads is a state and federal historic district. The crossing became the center of the town soon after establishment in 1666;http://lasur.epfl.ch/revue/A&C;%20Vol%204%20No.2/GUBLER.pdf the home of founder Robert Treat was located at the southwest corner. During the next centuries it remained the focal point of the city which grew around it. By 1834 the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company had established a terminal to the south and in 1869 the Newark and New York Railroad had one to the north. During the period of massive expansion at the start of the 20th century, the district became the city's modern business district, and site of its first skyscraper built by the Firemen's Insurance Company at the southeast corner in 1910. The Newark Public Service Terminal on Broad Street opened in 1916. Though faded in its former glory, the Four Corners district remains Newark's traditional center for commerce and business and since the late 2000s (decade) the focus of much interest in revitalizing retail, residential, and restaurant activity downtown. Broad and Market The names and the crossing of streets named Broad and Market is seen in many of the colonial cities in New Jersey, such as Paterson and Trenton and the United States, such as Philadelphia. In Newark, Broad Street, as the name suggests, is a wide avenue which runs north to Military Park and Broad Street Station, while to the south it passes Government Center and Symphony Hall. Market Street to the east passes Gateway Center and Newark Penn Station, while to the west are the Essex County Courthouse and the university campuses located in the city. It has long been a busy crossroad. In 1915, Public Service counted over 280,000 pedestrian crossings in one thirteen-hour period. Eleven years later, on October 26, 1926, a State Motor Vehicle Department check at the Four Corners counted 2,644 trolleys, 4,098 buses, 2,657 taxis, 3,474 commercial vehicles, and 23,571 automobiles. Between 1925 and 1939 a manned traffic control tower stood at the intersection. Historic district The historic district is one of seven in Newark.Newark landmarks website The Four Corners Historic District is roughly bounded by Raymond Boulevard, Mulberry Street, Hill, and Washington Streets and University Avenue. The district established in 1999‚Äì2000 encompasses an area of and includes many buildings which themselves are listed on the national and state registers of historic places. The area is considered vital in the redevelopment of the city, located between city attractions, residential neighborhoods, educational and commercial institutions. In 2010, in order to promote the restoration of facades in the district the city has implemented stricter signage policy for any renovations. The northwest quadrant of the district has been home to Prudential Headquarters since its founding. Three buildings built by the finance company, including the Gibraltar Building on Halsey Street, are found there, as is the original flagship store of the department store Bamberger's. The city's two tallest buildings, the neoclassical National Newark and Art Deco Eleven 80, are found in the northeast quadrant near the abutting historic district of Military Park. The southeast quadrant is home to the Kinney Building, Old First Presbyterian Church, the First National State Bank Building, the Newark and New York Railroad terminal, Newark City Hall at Government Center and historic Grace Church (Episcopal). The Prudential Center borders this section at Mulberry Street. A new hotel (Mariott Courtyard) and retail complex at Broad and Lafayette Streets is located there. Several buildings in the southeast quadrant have been renovated for residential spaces. The southwest quadrant of the historic district is home to Teachers Village, a neighborhood in which since 2010s has undergone revitalization through new construction and renovation. New construction and renovations in the neighborhood such as the mixed-use buildings, the William Flats, the approved 19-story Vibe and the planned 40-story Halo. as well as new restaurants, shops, bank, and a planned Eataly-style food marketplace.

It is based upon the biography of a fictional personality called Shyamrav Pethekar, better known as Sikander. The novel is set in Ahmedabad and draws an excellent and realistic portrait of Gujarat underworld, that is unknown in Hindi fiction. There are actually two novels of same nameJust like Stephen King wrote \\"two\\" The Stands. The only difference is that in Pathak's case the name of the second avatar is different. It is Kamptaa Shahar ( ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ç‡§™‡§§‡§æ ‡§∂‡§π‡§∞ ). In a way this is cheating the reader, because unlike King, Pathak gives no warning to the reader that he is going to buy almost same stuff he already read years ago Plot In the first version the story starts with Sikander planning to take revenge on a guy called Ratan Shah, who has cheated and killed Sikander's friend Kundan Seth. The trio of Rattan Shah, Kundan Seth and another fellow called Latif Katta kidnapped a rich businessman's nine-year-old daughter for Rs 40 Lakh.In the first version Mawali, we are not shown the details the girl's kidnapping and the frameup of Kundan Seth, we are just told that Seth has been cheated of his woman (Rupali was one of Shah's motive) and his money by Shah and it calls for Sikander to do something about it. This actually gave the publisher an excuse to make the book a bit thicker, and the reader was tricked into thinking he is reading a new novel for beginning is significantly different The plan was not to kill her but Ratan Shah turned traitor, he killed not only the girl but also Latif Katta and had poor Seth framed for both the murders, with help of a semi-callgirl Rupali, a police inspector called Gokhle and the management and staff of Hotel Surya.(Later instead of killing Rupali Sikander will force her to become his keep, along with her two sisters Malti and Kanchan, and at the end the three sisters will play a vital role in bringing down the Sikander by helping his arch-enemy Chhota Dalvi.) One by one Sikander kills all. As almost all were part of Ahmedabad underworld, the underworld is shaken to its foundations and the ruthless Sikander, whose main area was only Lal Darwaza, becomes more and more powerful as he becomes the monopolist of bootleggingThe prohibition of Gujarat is backdrop of the whole story. The main competition among them all is the trade of illicit liquor in the city. Bootlegging makes Sikander, who was born in a slum in Surat, a rich man living in a luxury flat. Then one day he makes a mistake, he tells Rupali the story of Samson and Delilah, and also tells her that just like Samson's hair, his weak point is his .38 revolver, a gift from his guru, a ruthless gangster called Commander, who brought up and trained him. One day Rupali vanishes with the gun and all the money. Sikander almost goes mad. He was so attached to his .38 that without it he feels as weak and vulnerable as a baby. His enemies, mainly Chhota Dalvi who is actually behind all mischief Rupali is doing, take advantage of this situation and one by one Sikander starts losing his assets. The government is also trying to trap him just like they trapped Tony Montana in Scarface - by income tax strategy. But Sikander has a simple solution to that - blow up the Income Tax Officer with a bomb ! When the underworld hears that Sikander is planning to blow up an IAS, they strongly suggest him not to do that. A grand meeting is held where all big dons of Gujarat including Firangi, Tony Masalamix and Vijaysingh (based on character of Vijay Mallya) are present to talk to Sikander just like the five \\"families\\" do in end of The Godfather, but Sikander has nor level-headedness nor maturity of Don Corleone - he childishly threatens to kill them all by singing a song ...machinegun uthaaya sabko udaaya... as he loses his temper when they question him about the disappearance of one of his subordinates. This way Sikander signs his own death warrant. In the end his own, most trusted lieutenants kill him (under instruction and pressure of the syndicate's general consensus) . The Tandoor Scandal Sikander has an innovative solution when it comes to disposal of dead bodies of all people he kills. He has contacts with a fellow called Vinaayakrav Tambe who runs a foundry, and he lets Sikander use it to make corpses vanish without leaving a trace. A famous murder occurred in Delhi which according to BBC \\"shook all country\\". More sensational than murder itself (which was in fact an honour killing) was the attempt to dispose the body. The murderer had a contact with a restaurant owner, which had a Tandoor (a clay oven used in India). After his apprehension the guilty told the police that he got the idea from this novel.

Unlike other ATM groups like the Cash Group and CashPool, the ATM service network of Bankcard-Servicenetz is not free of charge ‚Äì the service fee is not waived but the compact restricts the service fee to a common low level (usually 1,02 Euro and in some locations 2,05 Euro). However, in most tariffs of checking accounts, the service fee is taken over by the bank making the usage of the Bankcard-Servicenetz to be effectively free of charge to the customers.

Since Abbott Avenue is the border between Marshall and Tama counties, the bridge is in two counties lengthwise. Many bridges span from one county to another, but few are lengthwise split. It necessitated a joint session of the two counties' Boards of Supervisors on June 29, 1896, to approve the project.

Plot It's Jim Stonem's birthday, but he is still as bad-tempered as ever. He tries to make a rude joke about their turkey dinner and becomes angry at Tony's snide remarks. He only quiets down when his wife, Anthea, requests that he and Tony don't argue in front of Effy. The family give up on playing a board game as the instructions were translated poorly into English from Korean. Effy takes the board game upstairs and melts some of the pieces with her lighter. She pretends to go to bed but sneaks out to go partying. Tony fondly watches her leave and pretends to be a sleeping Effy when their parents check on up them. When they leave, he tries to call his friends but they are all ignoring him in favor of Michelle. Fed up with being alone, Tony goes out into town. Meanwhile, Effy goes to a party with her talkative friend, Julie. She flirts with a boy named Spencer and shares an E with him. The group is caught by the police and they are all arrested. When Tony goes to bail Effy out of jail, he is told that someone pretending to be her brother already bailed her out. Tony sees Effy getting into a van and chases after her, but is attacked by guys with masks. Worried about Effy, Tony goes to Chris's and requests to speak to Sid.

He was then given command of the ironclad monitor and took part in the engagements with Forts Sumter, Gregg, Moultrie, and Battery Bee, at the beginning of September 1863, and in the attacks on Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie in November 1863. In 1864-65 he commanded the steamer of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Sassacus towed the powder boat from Norfolk to Fort Fisher in December, and was engaged during the First and Second Battles of Fort Fisher in December 1864 and January 1865. Davis also took part in attacks on Fort Anderson on the Cape Fear River on 18 February; and on Fort Strong on 20 and 21 February. His ship was struck under the waterline, but the leak was kept under control until dark, and then effectually stopped. He was commissioned commander on 25 July 1866, and commanded the sloop from 1871 on the North Atlantic Station. Davis was promoted to captain on 14 February 1873, and was a member of the Lighthouse Board in 1876, and of the Board of Inspection in 1882. He was promoted to commodore on 4 February 1882, and commanded the Asiatic Squadron in 1883, and on 30 October 1885, received his commission as rear admiral. In November 1886, Davis was relieved of his command of the Asiatic Squadron and placed on the retired list. Davis died in Washington, D.C., in 1889, and is buried at the Rock Creek Cemetery there. Personal life Davis married Francis Latta Robinson (1836‚Äì1920) on December 12, 1855, in Carlisle, Indiana. They had one child, Katherine L. Davis (1860‚Äì1950).

Teletext (or \\"broadcast teletext\\") is a television information retrieval service developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s. It offers a range of text-based information, typically including national, international and sporting news, weather and TV schedules. Subtitle (or closed captioning) information is also transmitted in the teletext signal, typically on page 888 or 777. A number of similar teletext services were developed in other countries, some of which attempted to address the limitations of the British-developed system, with its simple graphics and fixed page sizes. UK: Teletext Teletext was created in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s. Different systems existed, but by the end of the decade they converged, with the creation of the World System Teletext (WST). WST remained in use for analogue broadcasts until 2012. =Early tests= Ceefax Early Ceefax test transmission The first test transmissions were made by the BBC in 1972‚Äì74, with the name Ceefax (\\"see facts\\"). The Ceefax system went live on 23 September 1974 with thirty pages of information. Due to the adoption of a common teletext standard (WST), the Ceefax system ceased in 1976. The name was retained for the service itself, that continued after that year using the WST standard. Oracle ORACLE was first broadcast on the ITV network in the mid-late 1970s. Due to the adoption of a common teletext standard (WST), the ORACLE system ceased in 1976. The name was retained for the service itself, that continued after that year using the WST standard. =World System Teletext= World System Teletext (or WST) is the name of a standard for teletext throughout Europe today. Almost all television sets sold in Europe since the early ‚Äô80s have built-in WST-standard teletext decoders as a feature. It originally stems from the UK standards developed by the BBC (Ceefax) and the UK Independent Broadcasting Authority (ORACLE) in 1974 for teletext transmission, extended in 1976 as the Broadcast Teletext Specification. With some tweaks to allow for alternative national character sets, and adaptations to the NTSC 525-line system as necessary, this was then promoted internationally as \\"World System Teletext\\". It was accepted by CCIR in 1986 as CCIR Teletext System B, one of four recognised standards for teletext worldwide. France: Antiope Antiope system page In France, where the SECAM standard is used in television broadcasting, a teletext system was developed in the late 1970s under the name Antiope. It had a higher data rate and was capable of dynamic page sizes, allowing more sophisticated graphics. It was phased out in favour of standard teletext in 1991. Canada: Telidon The CBC ran a teletext service, IRIS, accessible only in Calgary, Toronto and Montreal. It ran from 1983 until about 1986, and used the Canadian-developed Telidon system, which was developed in 1980. Like Antiope, Telidon allowed significantly higher graphic resolution than standard teletext. United States Adoption in the United States was hampered due to a lack of a single teletext standard and consumer resistance to the high initial price of teletext decoders. Throughout the period of analogue broadcasting, teletext or other similar technologies in the US were practically non-existent, with the only technologies resembling such existing in the country being closed captioning, TV Guide On Screen, and Extended Data Services (XDS). =Early tests= A version of the European teletext standard designed to work with the NTSC television standard used in North America was first demonstrated in the US in 1978 by station KSL in Salt Lake City, Utah, premiered a teletext service using Ceefax. They were followed by American television network CBS, which decided to try both the British Ceefax and French Antiope software for preliminary tryouts for a teletext service, using station KMOX (now KMOV) in St. Louis, Missouri as a testing ground.Teletext: Soon You'll Be Punching Buttons And Talking Back To Your TV, Associated Press (syndicated), 16 May 1979KSL-TV's Teletext Testing Shows No Reception Problems, InfoWorld, 18 February 1980. Also includes a prescient analysis of the likely economics of teletext and videotex CBS decided on Antiope and mounted a large market trial in Los Angeles in partnership with NBC and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Public television. Services premiered simultaneously on station KNXT (now KCBS-TV), KNBC and KCET in Los Angeles.David Crook, Teletext information systems are taking over television sets, Los Angeles Times (syndicated), September 18, 1981Pictures from KCET's 1980 teletext trial using Antiope All three services included an array of local news and information services. KCET's service also included service components for use in schools. =NABTS= Later, an official North American standard of teletext, called NABTS (North American Broadcast Teletext Specification) was developed in the early 1980s by Norpak, a Canadian company. NABTS provided improved graphic and text capability over WST, but was quite short-lived. This was mainly due to the expensive cost of NABTS decoders, costing in the thousands of dollars upon their release to the public. NABTS, however, was adopted for a short while by American TV networks NBC & CBS throughout the early-to-mid 80s, CBS using it for their short-lived ExtraVision teletext service, which premiered after the early Antiope & Ceefax trials by CBS & KNXT, and NBC, who had a NABTS-based service called NBC Teletext for a very short time in the mid-1980s. NBC discontinued their service in 1985 due to the cost of NABTS decoders not dropping to an affordable level for the consumer public.NBC discontinues teletext, InfoWorld, 11 February 1985, p. 21 The NABTS protocol received a revival of sorts in the late 90s, when it was used for the datacasting features of WebTV for Windows under Windows 98, and for Intel's now-defunct InterCast service (also for Windows as well), using a proper TV tuner card (such as the ATI All-In-Wonder or Hauppauge's Win-TV). =World System Teletext= WST was also used for a short time in the US, with services provided throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s by several regional American TV networks (such as the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison's Infotext service in the mid-1980s, which was carried on several TV stations across Wisconsin, and Agtext, provided by Kentucky Educational Television and carried on KET's stations, both services providing agriculturally oriented information) and major-market U.S. TV stations (such as Metrotext, which was formerly carried on station KTTV in Los Angeles, and KeyFax, formerly on WFLD in Chicago). WST-based service Electra Perhaps the most prominent of American teletext providers was the Electra teletext service, using WST, which was broadcast starting in the early 1980s on the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of the American cable channel WTBS. Electra was owned and operated by Taft Broadcasting and Satellite Syndicated Systems (SSS). Electra ran up until 1993, when it was shut down due to Zenith, the prominent (and only) American TV manufacturer at the time offering teletext features in their sets decided to discontinue such features, as well as a lack of funding and lagging interest in teletext by the American consumer. Zenith manufactured models of television sets in the US in the 1980s, most notably their Digital System 3 line, that had built-in WST teletext decoders as a feature, much like most British/European TV sets. Teletext services in the US like Electra could be received with one of these sets, but these were mostly more expensive higher- end sets offered by Zenith, possibly causing Electra (and American teletext in general) to never catch on with the public. Australian company Dick Smith Electronics (DSE) also offered through their US distributors a set-top WST teletext decoder kit. The kit used as its core the same teletext decoding module (manufactured by UK electronics company Mullard) installed in most British TV sets, with additional circuitry to adapt it for American NTSC video, and to utilize it in a separate set-top box. A significant reason for the demise of American teletext was when Zenith introduced built-in closed captioning decoders in TVs in the early '90s, as mandated by the FCC. It was not practical for Zenith to re-design their TV chassis models that previously had teletext decoder support to have both teletext and closed captioning support. So Zenith decided to drop the teletext features, therefore ending teletext service in the US in the early 1990s, considering Zenith was the only major manufacturer of teletext-equipped sets in the United States. = 1990s: InterCast = InterCast was a modern teletext-like system created by Intel in 1996, using a TV tuner card installed in a desktop PC running Windows with the InterCast Viewer software. The software would receive data representing HTML pages via the VBI (Vertical Blanking Interval) of a television channel's video, while displaying in a window in the InterCast software the TV channel itself. The HTML data received would then be displayed in another window in the Intercast software. It usually was extra supplemental information relevant to the TV program being viewed, such as extra clues for the viewer during a murder mystery show, or extra news headlines or extended weather forecasts during a newscast. NBC, as well as The Weather Channel, CNN and M2 (now MTV2), utilized InterCast technology to complement their programming. InterCast, however, fell into disuse, and Intel discontinued support of InterCast a few years later. = WaveTop = Another service in the US similar in delivery and content to teletext was the WaveTop service, provided and operated by the Wavephore Corporation. It used the same types of InterCast-compatible TV tuner cards, and used an application that ran under Windows, like InterCast. In fact, WaveTop software was also bundled with TV tuner cards that had InterCast software bundled with them as well. However, Wavetop was an independent service from InterCast, and wasn't a complementary service to a television program or channel like the latter. In fact, viewing television with a TV card was not possible while the WaveTop software was running, since the software utilized the TV tuner card as a full-time data receiver. WaveTop provided content from several different providers in the form of HTML pages displayed in the WaveTop software, such as news articles from the New York Times, weather information provided by The Weather Channel, and sports from ESPN. It also delivered short video clips, usually commercials, that could be viewed in the software as well. When it was in operation, WaveTop's data was delivered on the VBI of local public TV stations affiliated with PBS through their PBS National Datacast division, that the WaveTop software tuned the TV card to in order to receive the service. =Guide+= Yet another service in the U.S. that relied on data delivery via the VBI like teletext, was the Guide+ (Guide Plus, also referred to as GuidePlus+ as well) service provided and developed by Gemstar. There were several models of television sets made throughout the 90s by Thomson Consumer Electronics under the RCA and General Electric brands that had built-in Guide+ decoders. Guide+ was an on-screen interactive program guide that provided current TV schedule listings, as well as other information like news headlines. Some Guide+ equipped sets from RCA even had an IR- emitting sensor that could be plugged into the back of the TV, to control a VCR to record programs which could be selected from the on-screen Guide+ listings. In some ways, this was very similar to the Video Programming by TeletextVideo Programming by Teletext (VPT), Video Program System (VPS), and Programme Delivery Control (PDC) features of British/European teletext. Guide+ was a free service, supported by advertisements displayed on-screen in the Guide+ menu and listing screens, not unlike banner ads displayed on web pages. Guide+ was delivered over the VBI of select local American TV stations. Guide+ was discontinued by Gemstar in June 2004, and soon afterwards, Thomson dropped the Guide+ features from all RCA and GE television sets made afterward. However, Guide+ in the United States has now been replaced by Gemstar with a similar service (delivered in the same fashion via VBI like Guide+), called TV Guide On Screen. A small number of televisions, DVD recorders, and digital video recorders are now being released with TV Guide On Screen capabilities. The Guide+ name & service is still used in Europe by Gemstar. (The same service is known in Japan as G-Guide). =Star Sight= Similar to Guide+ was Star Sight,http://www.starsight.com with its decoders built into TVs manufactured by Zenith, Samsung, Sony, Toshiba, Magnavox, and others. This was an electronic program guide service similar to Guide+, but was a service that relied on monthly subscription fees paid by the user, not from revenue gathered from on-screen advertisements like Guide+. Star Sight discontinued operations on July 21, 2003, due to a lack of subscribers to the service. Star Sight's data was also delivered on the VBI of local PBS stations through the PBS National Datacast division, much like how WaveTop was delivered as mentioned previously in this article.

He is known for having drafted the criminal Commissar order in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. Career Born in 1891, M√ºller enlisted in the army in 1912 and served during World War I. He was retained by the Reichswehr and then the Wehrmacht, reaching the rank of Colonel in 1935. On 1 April 1939, M√ºller was promoted to the rank of Generalmajor and took command of the War Academy. 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, M√ºller was assigned to the Headquarters Chief of Staff of the Army, under the command of Franz Halder. M√ºller was in charge of legal and criminal action relating to the occupied areas in Europe. He remained at the General Staff until the end of the war. Commissar order The first draft of the Commissar Order was issued by General Eugen M√ºller on May 6, 1941 and called for the shooting of all commissars in order to avoid letting any captured commissar reach a POW camp in Germany.Jacobesn, Hans-Adolf \\"The Kommisssarbefehl and Mass Executions of Soviet Russian Prisoners of War\\" pages 505-536 from Anatomy of the SS State, Walter and Company: New York, 1968 pages 516-517 The German historian Hans- Adolf Jacobsen wrote: > \\"There was never any doubt in the minds of German Army commanders that the > order deliberately flouted international law; that is borne out by the > unusually small number of written copies of the Kommissarbefehl which were > distributed\\". The paragraph in which General M√ºller called for Army commanders to prevent \\"excesses\\" was removed on the request of the OKW.Jacobesn, Hans-Adolf \\"The Kommisssarbefehl and Mass Executions of Soviet Russian Prisoners of War\\" pages 505-536 from Anatomy of the SS State, Walter and Company: New York, 1968 page 519. Brauchitsch amended the order on May 24, 1941 by attaching M√ºller's paragraph and calling on the Army to maintain discipline in the enforcement of the order. The final draft of the order was issued by OKW on June 6, 1941 and was restricted only to the most senior commanders, who were instructed to inform their subordinates verbally. The enforcement of the Commissar Order led to thousands of executions.F√∂rster, J√ºrgen \\"The Wehrmacht and the War of Extermination Against the Soviet Union\\" pages 494-520 from The Nazi Holocaust page 502 The German historian J√ºrgen F√∂rster wrote in 1989 that it was simply not true, as most German Army commanders claimed in their memoirs and some German historians like Ernst Nolte were still claiming, that the Commissar Order was not enforced. On September 23, 1941, after several Wehrmacht commanders had asked for the order to be softened as a way of encouraging the Red Army to surrender, Hitler declined \\"any modification of the existing orders regarding the treatment of political commissars\\".Jacobesn, Hans-Adolf \\"The Kommisssarbefehl and Mass Executions of Soviet Russian Prisoners of War\\" pages 505-536 from Anatomy of the SS State, Walter and Company: New York, 1968 page 522.

A bill to create the NCHRH was tabled in the Parliament of India in the monsoon session of August 2010, but was eventually withdrawn.  Planned functions  The agency was planned to increase overall transparency, eliminating the present, allegedly corrupt admission formalities in the field of medical education. There was planned to be a common MBBS entrance test (single PMT) National Eligibility and Entrance Test -UG replacing the over 17 All India Pre Medical Test (PMTs) conducted all over the country for over 35,000 undergraduate seats. But Tamil Nadu has moved the Supreme Court challenging this decision of single common test for all India. The second major change would have been the National Exit Examination National Eligibility and Entrance Test PG for students graduating from Indian medical colleges. The draft proposed a National Committee for Accreditation and a National Medical Education and Training Board that would register and accredit medical colleges and prepare curricula for all streams of education in the health sector. The powers of the existing councils, including the Medical Council of India, would have been substantially reduced and they would deal only with licensing, continuing education and ethics. These bodies, though under the general supervision of the NCHRH, would be entirely independent in their structure and functioning, and consist of senior professional, selected or nominated through a rigorous process. The NCHRH would be a 15-member body.  Discussion and withdrawal  The original NCHRH Bill was re-drafted after several States raised objections on the ground that the body was highly centralized and would usurp the powers of the States. The re-constituted task force on NCHRH held several rounds of consultations in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai before coming up with the revised version. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare approved the revised draft for the proposed NCHRH Bill which would have been an overarching body for the health sector. As of November 2019, the NCHRH bill had been withdrawn.  Subsequent legislation  Legislation to create a National Medical Commission with similar powers was passed in 2019, but failed to achieve its goals. In 2019, the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill 2019 was passed into law, allowing the Indian government to regulate the Medical Council of India for two years.

At Qin's prime, he controlled most of modern Henan and parts of modern Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu, but he was eventually repeatedly defeated by the Tang general Zhu Quanzhong. His subordinates turned against him and delivered him to the Tang capital Chang'an, where he was executed.  Background and seizure of Cai Prefecture  It is not known when Qin Zongquan was born. His family was from Cai Prefecture, which, at the start of his known career, was part of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), and Qin served as an officer at Zhongwu's capital Xu Prefecture ().New Book of Tang, vol. 225, part 3. In late 880, when the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao was poised to cross the Huai River north to attack the center of Tang Dynasty territory,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. then-military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhongwu, Xue Neng (), sent Qin to try to contain Huang's advance. However, Xue was then killed in a mutiny led by Zhou Ji. Hearing of Xue's death, Qin expelled the prefect of Cai Prefecture and seized it. When Emperor Xizong subsequently commissioned Zhou as Zhongwu's military governor, Zhou made Qin the prefect of Cai Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Subsequently, Huang captured the Tang imperial capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu. Huang established a new state of Qi as its emperor. Zhou initially submitted to Huang, but by summer 881 had been persuaded by the Tang eunuch general Yang Fuguang into redeclaring allegiance to Tang. Yang also persuaded Qin to send forces to participate in the campaign against Huang, and Qin sent 3,000 men, under the command of his officer Wang Shu () to join Yang's army. (Finding Wang insubordinate, however, Yang executed Wang and seized his troops.) Under Yang's suggestion, later in the year, Emperor Xizong created a new Fengguo Circuit out of Cai Prefecture and made Qin its defender (Èò≤Á¶¶‰Ωø, Fangyushi). At a later point, Emperor Xizong gave Qin the greater title of military governor.  As military governor and renegade  In 883, Huang Chao, under attack from a group of Tang generals led by Li Keyong, was forced to abandon Chang'an and flee east. He had his general Meng Kai () attack Cai Prefecture. Qin Zongquan engaged Meng but was defeated, and reacted by opening the city gates and submitting to Huang. He thereafter joined his forces to Huang's. They put Chen Prefecture (Èô≥Â∑û, in modern Zhoukou, Henan) under siege, but were unable to capture it due to the defense by Chen's prefect Zhao Chou. In winter 883, when Huang was still sieging Chen, Qin himself put Xu Prefecture under siege, but was also unable to capture it. In spring 884, he also sent one of his younger brothers to attack Lu Prefecture (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui), and occupied Shucheng (ËàíÂüé, in modern Lu'an, Anhui) for some time, before the prefect of Lu, Yang Xingmin, sent his officer Tian Jun to expel Qin Zongquan's brother.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. By summer 884, Huang had been defeated, and he was killed by his nephew Lin Yan (). However, Qin did not resubmit to Tang authority, and instead sent troops to pillage the surrounding circuits. In particular, he attacked Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), but with Zhu Xuan the military governor of Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, in modern Tai'an, Shandong) coming to Zhu Quanzhong's aid, Qin was defeated, and he withdrew. Meanwhile, in winter 884, when another renegade Tang general, Lu Yanhong, was set to attack Xiang Prefecture (Ë•ÑÂ∑û, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), Qin sent his officers Qin Gao () and Zhao Deyin to aid Lu, and they captured Xiang Prefecture. Lu subsequently attacked Xu Prefecture and captured it, forcing Zhou Ji to flee, while Qin's forces took over Xiang Prefecture. Around the same time, Qin was also sending other officers to attack surrounding circuits, with Chen Yan () attacking Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu); Qin Zongxian () attacking Jiangxi Circuit (Ê±üË•ø, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi); Qin Gao capturing Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered at Xiang Prefecture); Sun Ru capturing the Tang eastern capital Luoyang, as well as Shanguo Circuit (ÈôùËô¢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan); Zhang Zhi () capturing Ru (Ê±ùÂ∑û, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan) and Zheng (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) Prefectures; and Lu Tang () attacking Xuanwu. It was said that wherever Qin's army went, it slaughtered, burned, raped, and pillaged the territory, in even crueler ways than Huang's army did. Further, the army did not carry food supplies, and it committed numerous acts of cannibalism. As, at that time, Emperor Xizong was planning to return from Chengdu to Chang'an but feared the display of force that Qin was making, he issued an edict trying to get Qin to resubmit, but Qin took no action on it. In spring 885, Qin ordered a nearby prefect, Wang Xu the prefect of Guang Prefecture (ÂÖâÂ∑û, in modern Xinyang, Henan), to pay taxes to him. Wang was unable to due so due to lack of funds, and Qin, in anger, attacked him. Wang, in fear, forced the people of Guang and Shou (Â£ΩÂ∑û, in modern Lu'an) to follow him south of the Yangtze River. Qin also attacked Ying (ÊΩÅÂ∑û, in modern Fuyang, Anhui) and Bo (‰∫≥Â∑û, in modern Bozhou, Anhui), but Zhu Quanzhong repelled his attack.  As emperor  In spring 885, Qin Zongquan declared himself emperor. (The name of his state, as well as any era names he might have been used, was lost to history.) Emperor Xizong, in response, commissioned Shi Pu the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) as the overall commander of the operations against him, although initially neither Shi nor any other Tang general took much action against him. Qin, after declaring himself emperor, continued his campaign to increase his territory. He sent his brother Qin Zongyan () to attack Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), while he captured Xu Prefecture, killing Lu Yanhong. Of the 20 surrounding prefectures, only Chen Prefecture, defended by Zhao Chou, and Xuanwu's capital Bian Prefecture (), defended by Zhu Quanzhong, continued to hold out against him. As of spring 887, Qin, angry that he was continuously unable to defeat Zhu, prepared for a decisive attack on Bian Prefecture. Zhu responded by sending his officer Zhu Zhen () to recruit soldiers in the east; Zhu Zhen returned with reinforcements and horses, allowing Zhu Quanzhong to defeat Qin Zongxian. When Qin Zongquan launched his major attack in summer 887, Zhu Quanzhong gathered the troops of Xuanwu and Yicheng (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan, which Zhu had seized earlier in the year) Circuits, as well as the aid troops led by Zhu Xuan and Zhu Xuan's cousin Zhu Jin (who had seized Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) by that point). The four circuits' joint troops dealt Qin's troops a major defeat at Bianxiao Village () just outside Bian's walls, causing Qin to flee. Upon hearing that Qin had been defeated, his officers who had seized Luoyang, Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, in modern Luoyang), as well as Xu, Ru, Huai (Êá∑Â∑û, in modern Xinyang), Zheng, Shan (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia), and Guo (Ëô¢Â∑û, in modern Sanmenxia), abandoned the cities and fled as well. It was said that from this point on, Qin's strength began to wane. With Huainan recently thrown into a state of confusion and war due to internecine battles between the military governor Gao Pian and Gao's officers L√º Yongzhi, Qin Yan, Yang Xingmin (whose name had been changed to Yang Xingmi by this point), and Bi Shiduo, among others, which resulted in a Yang Xingmi victory but the capital Yang Prefecture () and surrounding regions being laid waste, Qin Zongquan sent his brother Qin Zongheng () and Sun Ru southeast to try to wrest the control of Huainan from Yang Xingmi. Soon, hearing of Qin Zongquan's defeat at Zhu Quanzhong's hands, Qin Zongheng tried to return to Cai Prefecture to aid Qin Zongquan, but Sun killed him and took over the army, subsequently taking over Huainan for some time but no longer following Qin Zongquan's orders. Meanwhile, in winter 887, Qin Zongquan recaptured Zheng Prefecture, while Zhao Deyin, whom Qin had made the military governor of Shannan East Circuit, captured Jingnan and killed the Tang military governor Zhang Gui, leaving his officer Wang Jianzhao in control of Jingnan's capital Jiangling Municipality. In fall 888, the Tang general Cheng Rui attacked Jiangling and recaptured it, forcing Wang to flee. Upon losing Jingnan and realizing that Qin was in trouble, Zhao decided to switch loyalty to Tang and to enter into an alliance with Zhu Quanzhong, who had been made overall commander of the operations against Qin by this point. At Zhu's recommendation, then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother, who had succeeded him in early 888 after Emperor Xizong's death) commissioned Zhao the military governor of Shannan East (which was renamed Zhongyi) and Zhu's deputy. Meanwhile, Zhu, after seizing Luoyang and Heyang earlier in the year, decided to launch a decisive operation against Qin. He defeated Qin in a battle just south of Cai Prefecture, and Qin withdrew into Cai Prefecture to defend it against Zhu's siege. With Zhu's food supplies running low, he withdrew. After Zhu's withdrawal, Qin's forces took Xu Prefecture again.  Removal and death  However, shortly after, around the new year 889, Qin Zongquan's officer Shen Cong () carried out a coup against him, seizing him, breaking his legs, and putting him under arrest. Shen submitted to Zhu Quanzhong, who commissioned him acting military governor. However, in spring 889, another officer, Guo Fan (), killed Shen (claiming to Zhu that Shen had considered reinstalling Qin) and delivered Qin to Bian Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. Zhu then delivered Qin to Chang'an. On April 1, Qin was executed by decapitation under a lone willow, with the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region) Sun Kui () overseeing the execution. Right before the execution, Qin yelled out to Sun, \\"Minister, I, Qin Zongquan, was not committing treason. It was just that my faithfulness was not expressed well.\\" Hearing those remarks, those who gathered to witness the execution burst out in laughter. His wife Lady Zhao was either decapitated with him, or whipped to death.

Thomas has to catch serfs like himself, who come to the forest to hunt or cut wood without the permission of the master. Unsurprisingly the villagers do not like him and nickname him \\"Biryuk\\" for his surly and unsociable character. But in reality Thomas is a kind and conscientious man who lives with his young daughter Ulithi a simple life. Utterly devoted to the woods and trying to protect every tree, the main character is mistakenly killed by a gentleman's bullet, who came to the woods to shoot birds and wild boars.

In the UK, it is known as rattan garden furniture, as the more traditional natural rattan has fallen out of fashion. Wicker is not actually a material, but a method of weaving. The word is said to be derived from the Scandinavian word \\"vika\\" which means \\"To bend.\\" Traditionally, natural plant materials were used to manufacture a variety of different products including baskets, trays, indoor and outdoor furniture. Wicker was originally made from natural fibers, such as rattan, a material derived from the so-called rotan tree, a vine like plant.Wicker Basketry, by Flo Hoppe The term rattan is sometimes used interchangeably with wicker, but in fact denotes the fiber used to create the wicker work. Rattan is somewhat elastic and often used to produce baskets, hampers and chairs. The branch-like material is woven together for the purpose of constructing various wicker items. Resin wicker is a similar looking material. Synthetic polyethylene fiber resin wicker is generally durable, resistant to the sun's UV radiation and water.

Life Damon was born in Honolulu on March 13, 1845. His father was early missionary Samuel Chenery Damon (1815‚Äì1885) and his mother was Julia Sherman Mills (1817‚Äì1890). They arrived in Honolulu in 1842. His maternal great-uncle was minister Samuel John Mills (1783‚Äì1818), who took part in the Haystack Prayer Meeting which led to the formation of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the group that sent the first American missionaries to Hawaii. He was educated at Punahou School from 1856 to 1863. On September 5, 1872 he married Harriet Melinda Baldwin (1846‚Äì1932), daughter of missionary Dwight Baldwin (1798‚Äì1886). =Family and business= The Damons had four children: Samuel Edward Damon (born June 1, 1873), Mary Mills Damon (born November 23, 1877), Henry Fowler Damon (born January 16, 1883) and Douglas Wilfred Damon. His wife's brother Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842‚Äì1911) founded Alexander & Baldwin. This was one of the \\"Big Five\\" corporations that dominated the economy of territorial Hawaii. Damon started work as a clerk in the W. N. Ladd store in Honolulu, run by the son of the founder of ill-fated Ladd & Co. In 1871 he went to work for the bank of Charles Reed Bishop, the only one in the Hawaiian Islands at the time. By 1881 he became a full partner in Bishop's bank. He invested in and served on the board of directors of sugarcane plantations and the Oahu Railway and Land Company, and was vice president of his brother-in-law's Hawaiian Sugar Company. In 1884, he inherited over of the area known as Moanalua from Bernice Pauahi Bishop. She was the wife of his business partner, and a Hawaiian princess who inherited the land from King Kamehameha I. Damon was executor of Princess Pauahi's will, and trustee of the estate through 1916. Most of her land went to fund the Kamehameha Schools. He successfully appealed a lawsuit to the supreme court to demand exclusive fishing rights to the area offshore of Moanalua. In an even more unusual case, Charles Brenig, who had come to Hawaii under the name Simeon Weibert, died and left much of his estate to Damon. The will was contested by Brenig's widow and son, but appeals were denied. When Bishop moved to San Francisco in 1893 Damon acquired all shares of the Bishop bank. The bank later became the First Hawaiian Bank, and Damon's share was sold to BNP Paribas in 2001. =Politics= On August 12, 1884 King KalƒÅkaua made Damon a member of the Privy Council, where he served until March 7, 1891. He became a member of the board of education on July 7, 1887 and board of Health December 28, 1887. He was appointed minister of finance on July 22, 1889, replacing amateur geologist and businessman William Lowthian Green. He served until being replaced by Godfrey Brown on June 17, 1890. He kept on good terms with Queen Liliuokalani (his father had performed her wedding ceremony). He was out of town when the Committee of Safety deposed her. Since he knew people on both sides, he helped negotiate a peaceful outcome, where Liliuokalani surrendered under protest to the US Government. After the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, he was vice president of the Provisional Government of Hawaii from February 4, 1893 to May 29, 1893 when he again became minister of finance. He was also on the executive council of Sanford B. Dole (which replaced the privy council of the monarchy) until May 22, 1895. When it was apparent that the United States was not going to annex the islands immediately, he continued in the Republic of Hawaii government to September 12, 1896. James A. King replaced him temporarily in June 1896. He was made a special envoy to attend the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria in London. On August 11, 1897 he held the post for a third time, until November 13, 1899. He was Hawaii's last minister of finance, serving once more from December 21, 1899 until June 14, 1900 after the Hawaiian Organic Act established the government of the Territory of Hawaii and the cabinet was abolished. =Legacy= Wife Harriet Melinda Baldwin Damon \\"Ned\\" Damon died in 1904 His son Samuel Edward \\"Ned\\" Damon graduated from Punahou and then Yale. He studied accounting in Glasgow, Scotland where he married Gertrude Valentine Marr MacKinnon, daughter of William Mackinnon, an accountant at McClelland, Mackinnon & Blyth, and Elisabeth 'Bessie' Kerr Mackinnon n√©e Marr on January 17, 1899. They had four children, although one died young. He returned to work in the family bank, but was stabbed to death on September 27, 1904. After S. M. Damon died July 1, 1924, his estate (then estimated worth over US$250 million) was left in trust to his grandchildren. At one time it was the fourth largest private landowner in Hawaii. Son Henry Fowler Damon graduated from Yale; he married his brother Samuel's widow Gertrude, they had four children: Harriet Damon \\"Haku\\" Baldwin (1913‚Äì2003), Frances (Damon) Holt, Joan (Damon) Haig, and Henry E. Damon, and died December 19, 1926. Douglas Wilfred Damon died September 21, 1936. The property became very valuable as Honolulu was developed in the 20th century. Parts of Moanalua became Fort Kamehameha, Honolulu International Airport, Tripler Army Medical Center, Moanalua High School, the Salt Lake, Hawaii development, and Moanalua Gardens. In 2003, the office buildings alone were sold to the Real estate investment trust HRPT for over $480 million. Trustees of the estate included retired General Frederick C. Weyand, great-grandson David M. Haig, former bank president Walter Dods, and local attorney Paul Mullin Ganley. His last surviving grandchild, Joan Damon Haig, died on November 9, 2004. The estate had about 20 beneficiaries with annual total income of over $34 million, as plans were made for its distribution. However, only one grandchild, (Samuel Renny Damon) survived from his son Samuel, while four descended from son Henry. A lawsuit was filed (appealed to the Supreme Court of Hawaii) to determine how to divide the shares: equal shares for each great-grandchild, five shares for each grandchild, or half for each set of descendants by his two children. The 1914 will had almost no punctuation in its ten pages. The US Supreme Court refused to hear the case, so the estate, estimated worth $900 million in 2006, was distributed with half to descendants of each son. The estate had bought Kahuku Ranch on Hawaii island for $1.3 million in 1958 from James W. Glover. It is located on the southwest rift zone of Mauna Loa volcano, with headquarters at . The estate sold about of the ranch in 2003 to the US Government (with financing from the Nature Conservancy) to expand Hawaii Volcanoes National Park for $22 million. It was the largest conservation land deal in Hawaii's history, enlarging the park by more than 50%. Some was sold for residences, and some remains as a tourist accommodation. In 2006 Damon's coin collection alone was auctioned off for $3,884,000 by Doyle New York. It included an 1876 proof set from the US centennial. In 2007, the estate donated a collection of artifacts to the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. Damon was a founding trustee of the museum.

The former church building and hall now house the Museum of American History. History The congregation was established in the mid 1880s. The church building was built as a memorial to Flora E. (Giddings) Whiting by her husband C.I. Whiting, a local banker. It was designed by Edward S. Hammatt from Davenport, Iowa. Trinity Memorial was one of at least seven churches he designed in the Diocese of Iowa. In addition, he also designed Kemper Hall, an Episcopal school for boys, and St. Katherine's Hall, a school for girls, both of which were located in Davenport. Albert and Edmund Jenkinson Contractors of Sioux City, Iowa built the building. The cornerstone was laid on May 28, 1896 by Bishop William Stevens Perry with the assistance of the Quarry Lodge No. 404 A.F. & A.M. of Mapleton. The church was consecrated on September 20, 1896. It cost approximately $15,000 to build the church and it was deeded to the Trustees of the Diocese of Iowa the year it was built debt free. with The stained glass windows were donated by St. Thomas Episcopal Church in Sioux City. They had been removed from their former church before it was torn down in 1892. A rectory, which is now a private home, had been built at the same time as the church. The Rev. William Frost was the parish's first resident priest to live in the house. The Guild Hall was built in 1926. The Rev. Vine Victor Deloria, first priest of Native American heritage to serve in the Diocese of Iowa, was priest-in-charge at Trinity Memorial, Trinity in Denison, and St. John's in Vail from 1951 to 1953. After working in Washington, DC he returned to the diocese to serve as vicar at St. Paul's in Durant from 1959-1960 after which he left the diocese. The funeral of Charles G. Whiting, son of C.I. and Flora Whiting, was the last liturgy celebrated in the church in 1984. Services to deconsecrate the church were held in 1988. The church building and hall were purchased that same year by Keith Robinson for the museum. His collection of political Americana provided the nucleus of the museum's collection, and remains its primary exhibit. The museum also has artifacts of local interest that appear in the context of significant national events. Architecture Church entryway The church building is basically rectangular in shape, and measures . It was designed in a combination of the Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival styles. The Gothic is found in the polychrome finish of the brick and stone, the pointed arch windows and doors, the wall buttresses, the battlements on top the corner tower, and the steeply pitched roof with steep cross gables. The Romanesque is found in the short bell tower, the broad roof plane, the rusticated stone on the foundation, the entryway, and the quoins on the corners. The main facade on the west side is dominated by a large stained glass window that is flanked by two smaller windows. In the gable peak is a trefoil window below a large stone cross. A small narthex is located at the main entryway in the tower. The sandstone pillars of the portico are connected by a sandstone arch. Wrought iron grill work is located in the arch. Trefoils are cut into the sandstone railings. Medium-sized windows dominate both side elevations. The small extension on the north elevation was designed to house a pipe organ that was never installed. The sacristy was in the extension on the south elevation. The rounded apse on the east side of the building has four windows and is where the altar was located on the inside. A small cross tops the gable on the east side of the church above the apse.

The monument was built in 1928, damaged during the Polish annexation of the territory in 1938‚Äì1939 and after the end of the World War II partially reconstructed.  Beginnings  Immediately after the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War started members of the Sokol in Orlov√° begun to organize material and financial gatherings to support wounded Czech soldiers and surviving relatives of the Czech soldiers fallen in the war.Matroszov√° (2005), page 27. As gathered finances have accumulated a loose association named \\"Fund for the survivors and for construction of a monument commemorating fallen for Tƒõ≈°√≠n Silesia with a seat in Orlov√°\\" () was created.Matroszov√° (2005), page 28. The goal of the Fund was the organisation of welfares the proceeds of which would be used to support families of the fallen soldiers and to maintain graves of the soldiers on the Orlov√° cemetery. In time the main goal of the Fund became construction of a representative monument commemorating the fallen soldiers. Already in 1919 a provisional wooden monument was erected on the Orlov√° cemetery. At the beginning of 1922 the Fund together with the \\"Sokol district of Tƒõ≈°√≠n Silesia of Jan ƒåapek\\" () initiated exhumation and transfer to Orlov√° of the remains of 22 legionnaries and soldiers buried in what was now the Polish part of Cieszyn Silesia (in Cieszyn and Pruchna). In July the remains of Jan ƒåapek were ceremonially buried on the Orlov√° cemetery. Next to Jan ƒåapek there were buried in total further 55 soldiers fallen in the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War or the following plebiscite period. Each year on 1 November a commemorative celebration took place next to the graves. In 1924 the Fund transformed into an association and its name changed to \\"Association to honour the fallen for Tƒõ≈°√≠n Silesia\\" (). Its goals remained unchanged.  Construction  In October 1924 the Association announced an anonymous competition for a proposal of a monument commemorating the fallen for Tƒõ≈°√≠n Silesia. Out of 39 proposals in total the five-member committee chose three. First prize went to the proposal \\"Green exclamation mark over Orlov√°\\" () of the architects Str√°nsk√Ω and ≈†l√©gl and the academic sculptor V√°clav ≈Ωaluda.Matroszov√° (2005), page 29. In March 1924 the Association obtained financial support from the Resistance Memorial in Prague. On 7 March a competition for construction works was announced. Financial gatherings were constantly taking place. In January 1927 the 34th infantry regiment of ‚ÄûGunner Jan ƒåapek‚Äú of the Czechoslovak Army became a founding member of the Association and it helped the Association by gatherings and organisation of military band concerts. The monument was erected in 1928. The sculpture with the Silesian eagle was made of sandstone by the sculptor Ferdinand Malina of Orlov√°. The architectural part was made by the constructor, architect and a former Italian legionnary ƒåenƒõk Voln√Ω of Doubrava. The construction oversight was conducted by the authors of the project Str√°nsk√Ω, ≈†l√©gl and ≈Ωalud. The monument was unfolded on 30 September 1928. The Association ceased its activities after settling all of its obligations by a decision of its liquidation general meeting on 26 May 1938. The administration of the monument was transferred to the \\"Sokol district of Tƒõ≈°√≠n Silesia of Jan ƒåapek\\" () and the \\"Moravian-Silesian district of the Czechoslovak Legionnary Community\\" ().  Damage  During the Polish annexation of Zaolzie in October 1938 ‚Äì August 1939 the monument was damaged,Martin Ju≈ôica: Ze vzpom√≠nek gener√°la Aloise Vicherka z let 1938‚Äì1939, Tƒõ≈°√≠nsko 1/2002, page 26.

It was established in 1696 by Father Fran√ßois Pinet, a French Jesuit priest. The mission was abandoned by 1700; its exact location remains unknown. Background In the 17th century the Chicago area was inhabited by a number of Algonquian peoples, including the Mascouten and Miami tribes, who had migrated into northern Illinois and Wisconsin as a result of the Beaver Wars. Jesuit missionaries exploring the Great Lakes region had first encountered these tribes in the 1650s. The Miami had established some villages on the Des Plaines and Chicago Rivers in the mid-17th century, but these were abandoned in the 1650s as they moved west of the Mississippi and then to Wisconsin. Father Jacques Marquette on his first encounter with the Miami at a large village near what is now Portage, Wisconsin during his expedition with Louis Jolliet to the Mississippi River in 1673 described them as \\"the most civil, the most liberal, and the most shapely [of the three nations that occupied the village].\\" In the 1690s the Miami returned to the Chicago area, establishing two villages; one at the mouth of the Chicago River, and another about upstream on the north branch of the river. Pinet's Mission Pierre Fran√ßois Pinet was born at P√©rigueux in France on November 11, 1660, and entered the Jesuit novitiate at Bordeaux in 1682. He travelled to Canada in 1694, arriving first in Quebec then travelling to Montreal, Ville-Marie, and Michillimackinac.Grover (1907), pp. 159‚Äì164 In 1696 Pinet established the Mission of the Guardian Angel at Chicago,Quaife (1913), p. 39 but he was soon forced to abandon the mission by Louis de Buade de Frontenac, the Governor General of New France. An appeal was made to Fran√ßois de Laval, bishop of New France, and the mission was re-established in 1698. Sometime after 1700, the Miamis started to move to the Maumee and Wabash valleys in Indiana, and the mission was permanently abandoned. After the closing of the Mission of the Guardian Angel at Chicago, Pinet moved to work amongst the Illiniwek tribes living at Cahokia. He then moved with the Illiniwek to join the Kaskaskia tribe on the north bank of the River des Peres in what is now St. Louis, Missouri. A letter by Father Bergier dated March 1, 1703 states that Pinet died at River des Peres on August 1, 1702.Garraghan (1921), p. 20-21 Location The exact location of the Mission of the Guardian Angel in unknown but various historians have proposed a number of sites in the Chicago area. The only contemporary source that gives any clues as to the location is a letter, dated January 2, 1699, from Jean-Fran√ßois Buisson de Saint-Cosme to Fran√ßois de Laval in which he relates a visit to the mission.Quaife (1913) p. 40 John Gilmary Shea published an English translation of the letter in 1861;Shea (1861), pp. 45‚Äì75 however, Chicago historian Milton Milo Quaife, writing in 1913, noted that Shea's translation \\"frequently departs from the original manuscript\\" and that differences in translation may account for some of the different sites proposed. Describing his visit to the Mission of the Guardian Angel, Saint-Cosme wrote: In 1907 Frank Reed Grover, used Shea's translation to propose that the mission had not actually been located at Chicago, but rather further north on the north branch of the Chicago River, near Skokie, Illinois.Grover (1907), p. 156 Quaife, working from a duplicate of the original manuscript concluded that the mission was built on the banks of the main stem of the Chicago River, somewhere between the forks and its mouth in what is now downtown Chicago.Quaife (1913), p. 42 Other locations proposed include Lake Calumet and a location near Goose Island.Garraghan (1921), p. 14 Other locations suggested have been Evanston by the Evanston Historical Society, Lake Calumet by Hurlbut, Churchill Woods by V. P. Web, Winnetka by the Saints Faith Hope and Charity Parish Winnetka, the Merchandise Mart by Swenson, Highland Park by Bower and Dooley, the area around LUMA (a Loyola University campus) by Loyola University Chicago, Gross Point by Grover, and Wilmette.

Designed in the Carpenter Gothic style of architecture, it was erected in 1881. It is one of the few remnants of the English era in Le Mars' early history. The church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. History After Fred and William Close of England opened a land sales office in LeMars in 1879, they began to plan an English colony. with Men from England were sent to the Le Mars area to study farming in the late 19th century. Over the years over 1,000 people would settle here as a part of this program. Some were the sons of established upper-class English families who returned home after they learned farm management techniques. Grace Mission was established in order to serve their spiritual needs. Its first building was located at Fifth and Hubbard Streets, now First Street SW and Fifth Avenue SW. They later moved to the Apollo Hall. The congregation reorganized itself as St. George's Church on October 4, 1881. The present church building was completed the same year for about $3,200. The money was sent from England to build the church. It was consecrated on June 9, 1882. The church's first rector was a Cambridge graduate, and his successor graduated from Oxford. By the 1890s the parishioners were mostly non-English residents as most of the English had left Le Mars. The church is one of the few structures left from the city's English era. The parish hall was built in 1963 and housed St. George's Preschool. St. George's is still an active parish in the Diocese of Iowa. Architecture The church building is built over a limestone foundation, and utilizes a unique board and batten border just below the horizontal clapboard. There are narrow hoods over the Gothic arched windows. The double-hung windows feature various designs of colored glass. The windows on the south side contain unique cut glass. The lancet arch over each window is pressed glass. There is an entrance tower on the main fa√ßade. It was originally capped by a small spire, but it was removed around the turn of the 20th-century and the roof gable was extended to cover the tower. The wooden exterior steps feature railings that were reproduced in the early 1990s to mimic the early banisters. The pews on the inside are original to the church. The altar is similar in appearance to the original and the pulpit dates from 1892.

It was built in 1615 by Sofi Sinan Pasha, bey of Budim. The mosque overlooks the main street of Prizren and is a dominant feature in the town's skyline. Sinan Pasha Mosque was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990 by the Republic of Serbia.–°–ø–æ–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ü–∏ –∫—É–ª—Ç—É—Ä–µ —É –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∏ - Sinan-pa≈°ina d≈æamija History Sofi Sinan Pasha started construction of the mosque in either 1600 or 1608. Sofi Sinan Pasha, a former beylerbey and kaymakam in Bosnia should not be confused with grand vizier Sinan Pasha, who built the Sinan Pasha Mosque in the nearby city of Kaƒçanik. It is widely considered that the stones used to build the mosque were taken from nearby Saint Archangels Monastery, a Serbian Orthodox monastery founded by Serbian Emperor Stefan Du≈°an. In fact, parts of the former monastery can be seen in the mosque. The monastery, which was abandoned after the arrival of the Ottomans in the 16th century, had fallen to ruins by the 17th century. Hasan Kaleshi, an Albanian historian, sustained in 1972 that Sofi Sinan Pasha couldn't have possibly ordered any monastery destruction as this was impossible without a Sultan decree, rather, he ordered the use of the spare stones to a better deed as ordered by the Sultan. Description The mosque covers roughly by and is square in shape. It has one large dome and another smaller half-dome that covers the mihrab, which is painted and has a stalactite hood. The mosque's walls are thick and its minaret, which is topped by a conical structure covered by lead, is in height. The walls and dome inside Sinan Pasha Mosque were painted in the 19th century, mostly of floral patterns and Qur'an verses. The minbar is painted with floral motives. Both the large dome and the half-dome of the mosque are covered with lead. The stone flooring of the mosque and the carpentry are original. Preservation concerns Rain, which over time has entered the mosque via holes in the roof, has caused the loss of some original paintings on the walls and has led to the detachment of some of the wall plaster. Stones of the fa√ßade have faced weathering. Abdullah G√´rguri worked on a series of repairs of the murals, particularly in the 1970s. In early 2000 the cost to rehabilitate the building was estimated at about ‚Ç¨500,000 by UNESCO. Manuscripts and use of building controversy The Prizren municipality intended to build a library within the mosque in order to preserve not only the original Ottoman manuscripts found in the mosque, but also other valuable ones that can be found all over Kosovo. However, the Islamic Union of Kosovo filed a lawsuit against the Prizren Municipality in order to not allow the mosque to become a museum, but instead to have it continue to be a religious building.

Skins on imdb.com Contrarily to the season's other episodes, it does not focus particularly on one character but on the group as a whole, a first for the show. Plot It's Anwar's 17th birthday. He receives a call from his best friend Maxxie, who wishes him a happy birthday. Anwar invites Maxxie to his party. Maxxie declines, however, saying he will only go if Anwar tells his very strict Muslim parents that Maxxie is gay. Anwar declines and begins his day by being told off by his father for missing prayer, and having to put up with his annoying uncle from Sutton Coldfield. In the meantime, Tony sadly watches his sister Effy head off to her new school, local independent school with fellow pupils such as shallow, unstable Abigail Stock for company. Chris is put-out, too, when his girlfriend (and psychology teacher), Angie's fianc√©, an Australian weatherman named Merve, turns up. Chris is furious at Angie for her infidelity, and something strikes him about Merve, but he can't quite put his finger on it. Sid attempts writing a love letter to Cassie, but gives up and decides instead to go see her at the hospital, leaving the love letter on his desk. Putting on the first clothes he could find, Sid marches to the private psychiatric hospital in mis-matched clothes with odd shoes and socks and tells the nurse he \\"needs to speak to someone\\" and that he has \\"stuff going on\\", and finds himself detained against his will into a padded cell. Cassie, meanwhile, writes Sid a letter saying she is moving to Elgin that night and leaves the hospital with her bulimic friend. Michelle meets Effy and asks her why she doesn't ever speak and why Tony hurt her. Later that day, Chris breaks into Angie's house and is horrified to find countless photos of her and Merve, and an engagement ring. He pockets the ring, and watches a video of Merve doing the Australian weather forecast, assuming from Merve's camp mannerisms that Merve is gay. Angie and Merve show up and Chris apologises for breaking into her house, but taunts Merve about his supposed hidden sexuality. Anwar's uncle is DJing for the birthday party; unimpressed with the tacky disco music, Anwar complains. His dad initially tells him his uncle should DJ because he has a proper ear for music so that Anwar's English friends don't burn the place down, however, once out of earshot of Anwar's mother, he confesses that Anwar's uncle is an \\"arsehole\\" and notes grimly that while he's DJing, he can't grope women. Anwar then expects to get the best birthday present ever as a friend of his sisters' shows interest in him. He begins kissing her, but leaves to gossip to Maxxie, who is waiting outside. While Anwar is begging Maxxie to come inside, his dad comes outside and the two boys reveal that Maxxie is gay. Anwar's dad doesn't seem to mind and invites Maxxie inside regardless. Tony and Effy rescue Sid from the hospital, bring clothes with them, and take him to find Cassie, assuming she'll be at Anwar's birthday party. Sid arrives at the party at roughly the same time as Merve, who demands his ring back off Chris. Chris gives the ring to Angie, who gives it back to Merve, turning down his proposal, but also breaking up with Chris. A fight breaks out in the club between the English and the Australians. Tony finds Cassie outside and gives her Sid's love letter. He then tries to call Michelle, who is crying in the bathroom. Struggling to find a good connection, Tony walks out onto the road and is hit by a bus, directly in front of Effy. Before being hit, he is able to leave a voicemail on Michelle's phone, proclaiming his love for her. Sid leaves the club to find Cassie and meets her by her favourite spot in the city, where she tried to commit suicide.

It is native to Eurasia, and it is known on other continents as an introduced species and in some areas a common roadside weed. It is an annual herb producing a hairy, erect stem which can exceed a meter in height. The leaf blades are divided into triangular, lance-shaped, and toothed linear lobes, and are borne on petioles. The top of the stem is occupied by a raceme of flowers with bright yellow petals each measuring just under a centimeter long. The fruit is a silique up to 3.5 centimeters in length containing tiny seeds. This plant is allelopathic against other species growing around it. It produces chemicals that inhibit the germination of seeds of other species, including bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) and Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis).Bainard, L. D., et al.

In 1858, he was ordained by the Bishop of Hipon, and went out to Canada under the auspices of the Colonial and Continental Church Society, but soon became assistant to the Bishop of Huron in the cathedral at London, Toronto. In 1866, the Bishop of Rupertsland, who had been at Aberdeen with Maclean, invited him to come into his diocese, and Maclean was appointed warden of St. John's College, rector of St. John's Cathedral, Winnipeg, and archdeacon of Assiniboia, a title afterwards altered to archdeacon of Manitoba. Maclean worked hard; the population increased greatly with the growth of Winnipeg, and consisted in the country districts of very poor settlers. Visiting England in order to raise money for a new bishopric, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts granted a certain income, and on 3 May 1874 he was consecrated bishop of Saskatchewan. His diocese consisted of 420,000 square miles of very poorly settled country, and no large subscriptions could be relied on from the inhabitants. However, Maclean managed, by energetically calling attention in England and Canada to the needs of the district, to secure a permanent endowment for the see and for Emanuel College at Alberta, which under his care became a university.

The Ross Institute, 364 F.3d 471 (2d Cir. 2004), was a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decision that held that the defendant's critical analysis of material obtained in bad faith, i.e., in violation of a non-disclosure agreement, was fair use since the secondary use was transformative as criticism and was not a potential replacement for the original on the market, regardless of how the material was obtained. NXIVM, (pronounced NEX-ee-um) a multi-level marketing company that offered a life- improvement seminar called the \\"Executive Success\\" program (ESP), sued the Ross Institute and several individuals for posting quotations from a NXIVM training manual on Ross Institute's website in the context of two written critiques of the manual and NXIVM's training program. NXIVM's lawyers attempted to argue that the fair use doctrine did not apply since Ross had obtained copies of the manuscript in bad faith, i.e., he obtained them from a former ESP participant who had signed a non-disclosure agreement. Both the district court and the appeals court ruled in Ross's favor. An appeals judge stated, \\"Certainly, no critic should need an author's permission to make such criticism, regardless of how he came by the original; nor should publication be inhibited by a publisher's anxiety or uncertainty about an author's ethics if his secondary work is transformative.\\" Facts NXIVM is a multi-level marketing company that offered a life-improvement seminar called the \\"Executive Success\\" program (ESP) that trained participants in a method NXIVM claimed would improve communication and decision-making. As part of the ESP seminar, NXIVM provided a training manual to paying participants who signed non-disclosure agreements that they would not discuss or release the manual to non-participants. As executive director of the nonprofit organization the Ross Institute, Rick Ross maintained two websites to provide information to the public about cults and other controversial groups that had complaints made against them for allegedly using deception and undue influence to manipulate participants. Ross received the NXIVM manual through a former ESP participant and commissioned reports from two mental health professionals who analyzed and critiqued the manual, quoting sections of it to support their analysis. The reports, which referred to the program as \\"expensive brainwashing,\\" were made available to the public on Ross‚Äôs websites. About 17 of 500 pages were republished on Ross's websites in the context of the critiques. In 2003, NXIVM filed a federal trade-secrets lawsuit against the Ross Institute, Rick Ross, the authors of the reports, and the former ESP participant who provided the manual to them, alleging copyright infringement for their use of quotations from NXIVM's \\"secret\\" manual in the online critical reports of the manual and training program, arguing that the fair use doctrine should not apply since the manual had been obtained through the violation of a nondisclosure agreement, constituting bad faith. Finding that the reports were likely protected by the fair use doctrine, the district court denied NXIVM's motion seeking a preliminary injunction, a court order mandating that Ross remove the material from his websites. NXIVM appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Issue The issue before the Court was whether a fair use defense was available where the materials used were obtained in bad faith.  Opinion of the Court  The Court noted that defendants‚Äô misconduct in obtaining unauthorized material is one of several relevant factors in a fair use defense as set forth by the Supreme Court in Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises, but that obtaining the manuscript in bad faith does not preclude a fair use defense. The Court weighed the four fair use factors to determine if Ross‚Äôs use was fair, and made the following findings: # The purpose and character of the use was transformative as criticism and favored the defendants even if the defendants‚Äô bad faith in obtaining the manual favored the plaintiffs. # The nature of the copyrighted work was unpublished and favored the plaintiffs. # The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole did not favor the plaintiffs as (1) it was reasonable for the defendants to quote liberally from the manual in order to critically comment on it and (2) there was no identifiable \\"heart\\" of the manual. # The market inquiry heavily favored the defendants because, \\"as a general matter, criticisms of a seminar or organization cannot substitute for the seminar or organization itself or hijack its market.\\" The Court ruled in favor of the defendants and affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction, stating, > If criticisms on defendants' websites kill the demand for plaintiffs' > service, that is the price that, under the First Amendment, must be paid in > the open marketplace for ideas...Certainly, no critic should need an > author's permission to make such criticism, regardless of how he came by the > original; nor should publication be inhibited by a publisher's anxiety or > uncertainty about an author's ethics if his secondary work is > transformative.

(6 April 1896 ‚Äì 20 September 1972) was a Romanian diplomat, most noted for his ambassadorship in the United Kingdom during the Second World War. He died in London. During the Second World War, Tilea lived at Holton Place, Oxfordshire, where he became a key representative of Romania's monarchist regime in exile. Early life He was born in Sibiu. He studied at the Hermannst√§dter Evangelisches Obergymnasium in Sibiu, before joining the University of Bratislava. However, in 1915, he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army. He completed his studies at the University of Vienna. Personal life In 1921, he married Eugenia \\"Gene\\" Pop in Cluj. After a short stay in London in February 1922, the two returned to Cluj. Tilea published two works, entitled Rolul diploma≈£iei √Æn politica de stat (\\"The role of diplomacy in state policy\\") and Ac≈£iunea diplomaticƒÉ a Rom√¢niei (\\"Romanian diplomatic action\\"), eventually translated into German, Hungarian, Croatian and Bulgarian. He had three daughters, Ileana Troiano, Ioana Ellerington and Stanca Lipton and a son Scotus Tilea, from his first marriage and a son Ioni Tilea and daughter Anca Tilea from his second marriage to Manuela Monroe. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (C.B.E.). Career = Early career = In October 1918, he joined the Romanian National Council, and was soon sent to Geneva, to meet Mr Herron, an American writer, and friend of US President Woodrow Wilson. Between February and October 1919, he served as the private secretary of Iuliu Maniu, and from October to December 1919 the private secretary of Alexander Vaida, attending the Paris Peace Conference. It was in that year he became attached to the Romanian Legation in London. He served as Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Envoy of Romania to London between 1938 and 1940. He was the first to work in 1 Belgrave Square, the current home of the Romanian Embassy in London. = Romanian war scare = In mid-March 1939, Tilea falsely reported to the British government that his country was under the verge of an immediate German attack, which led to a U-turn on British policy of resisting commitments of Eastern Europe, as part of the government's European policy, which became known as the \\"Romanian war scare\\". In fact, there was no German attack planned on Romania in March 1939, but faced with troops from Romania's archenemy, Hungary, concentrating on the border, and German efforts to secure control of Romania's oil industry, the Romanian government had concluded that there was a danger of a Hungarian- German invasion and had exaggerated the danger level to secure British support. Whether Tilea was deliberately exaggerating the German threat to Romania as a way of gaining British support against the German demands to surrender the control of their oil industry as claimed by the British historian D.C. Watt, or if the Romanians genuinely believed that they were about to be invaded by Germany in March 1939, as claimed by the American historian Gerhard Weinberg, is still unclear. = Second World War = In September 1940, a coalition of Horia Sima, leader of the Iron Guard, and General (later Marshal) Ion Antonescu had formed a National Legionary State in Romania, forcing King Carol II to abdicate in favour of his 19-year-old son Michael, who became a figurehead to the new fascist regime. DIning that period, Tilea was recalled from his post in the Romanian embassy in London, but he decided to stay in England, requesting political asylum. Resigning his post, he co-founded the Free Romanian Movement. In the meantime, Carol II fled to exile in Mexico, where he wrote to his distant cousin, George VI, hoping for British support for an overthrowing of the new government to return it to a monarchy. The British did not support that, however, and so Tilea would spend the war in planning the liberation of Romania by external means with the Allies. Tilea also played a role in assisting the efforts that the British government made to support monarchists in Romania.

His intention was that it should \\"tend to the improvement of the intellect\\". The magazine published articles on middle-class domestic issues, fashion and fiction. In 1867, Beeton expanded the correspondence section of the magazine. The contents of this \\"Conversazione\\", now included contributions by men, included material extolling the attractions of corsetry/tight-lacing, cross-dressing and flagellation; extracts on the latter were republished in pornographic compilations such as The Birchen Bouquet.  Social importance  The magazine was considered an essential tool for any Victorian woman looking to fit into society and keep up with the times, especially in terms of fashion. Beeton later published other journals, some specifically on Victorian fashion. Le Moniteur de la Mode and The Queen appeared in 1861. They emphasized what was already featured in the EDM. The magazine was a way for readers to write in and explain their own lives and problem remedies. It could be used as an encyclopedia, a correspondence between readers, and a place for women to share their thoughts on everyday issues.  Corsets  Corsets and tight-lacing were extensively explored by EMD. Tight-lacing was used as a way to enhance a women's figure, as it gradually added pressure on her waist to make it smaller over time. Some women slept in their corsets in hopes of tying it tighter in the morning. EDM had a correspondence column called, ‚ÄúThe Corset Correspondence‚Äù. Two columns ‚ÄúCupids Letter-Bag‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnglishwoman‚Äôs Conversazione‚Äù were later combined into ‚ÄúThe Conversazione‚Äù‚Äù. The editors ‚Äúdecided to create some detached volumes about the themes due to the profit that this topic brought in. The Corset and the Crinoline (later republished as The Freaks of Fashion) and a History of the Rod‚Äù. EDM became a source of information for Victorian women. It sparked controversy, especially in terms of fashion and the pressures it put on women to look a certain way in a society obsessed with appearance. Corsets became the rage. Young girls, sometimes under the age of ten, were forced to tighten their waists before puberty. For instance, ‚ÄúThe Englishwoman‚Äôs Domestic Magazine of September 1872 included a patter and sketch for a garment called baby stays, which were not boned but could be tied tightly‚Äù. ‚ÄúL. Thompson, a correspondent in the Englishwoman‚Äôs Domestic Magazine, not only recommended putting young girls in stays at an early age, but suggested that it was actually the common practice: ‚ÄùIt is seldom that girls are allowed to attain the age of fourteen or fifteen before commencing stays. The great secret is to begin their use as early as possible, and no‚Ä¶severe compression will be requisite. It seems absurd to allow the waist to grow large and clumsy, and then reduce it again to more elegant proportions by means which must at first be more less productive of inconvenience‚Äù‚Äù. The idea was to direct body growth to minimize the possibility of an unfashionable figure. Corseting girls and the health (mental and physical) problems it could create was a frequent discussion point. ‚ÄúIn 1867 an innocent letter from a mother worried about the use of corsets in her daughter‚Äôs school sparked a long discussion, in which the connection between tight-lacing, torture and pleasure was made explicit. Right when the ‚Äúcorset correspondence‚Äù ended, a more sadistic subject rose, concerning the habit of whipping to control female servants and girls‚Äù. Furthermore, ‚Äúa letter, which started the long discussion of tight-lacing, came from a mother complaining that she had left her ‚Äúmerry, romping girl‚Äù in a ‚Äúlarge and fashionable boarding school near London‚Äù when she went abroad. On her return four years later she saw a ‚Äútall pale young lady glide slowly in with measured gait and languidly embrace me‚Äù; her absurdly small waist explained her change in demeanor‚Äù.

Once one of the largest-acreage African American-owned properties in the United States, it was situated in Southwest Georgia.  Model for U.S. community land trusts  Instrumental in the forming of the partnership was Slater King (1927‚Äì1969), a community leader and Civil Rights activist from Albany. Working with such collective farm activists as Robert Swann and Shimon Gottschalk, several black leaders in Albany, Georgia, patterned the form of the organization after legal documents used by the Jewish National Fund in Israel. Group members traveled to Israel to study how the J.N.F. leases land for various uses. They chose to include leases for homesteads and cooperative farms. The group bought the farmland and leased it to members. The documents evolved to a degree after the 1960s and, , there were hundreds of community land trusts in the United States with more being planned. Swann later wrote (along with co-author Susan Witt, in their scholarly essay \\"Land: Challenge and Opportunity\\"): \\"The perseverance and foresight of that team in Georgia, motivated by the right of African- American farmers to farm land securely and affordably, initiated the CLT movement in this country [the U.S.].\\"  Collective's production, financial woes and civil suit settlement with USDA  The group used roadside stands to sell crops, built a roadside smokehouse for the hogs they slaughtered, and a roadside sugarcane mill, to attract customers. They pioneered the raising of Muscadine grapes, putting in of the crop ‚Äì now commonly grown in Southwest Georgia. On devoted to row crops, they raised area staples: corn, peanuts and soybeans. Yet in 1981 the region where the farms were located experienced severe drought. According to the findings of federal arbitrators in 2009, unlike similar requests from area farmers that were white, New Communities' application for an emergency loan from the United States Department of Agriculture for an irrigation system was denied with no clear explanation. In 1982, the drought continued and the operation sold lumber for $50,000 to remain viable. The USDA demanded its receipt of these funds as a condition for a loan. In 1983 the agency requested and received the deed to the holdings and provided nothing in return. In the aftermath of the Pigford v. Glickman class- action discrimination lawsuit, in 2009 New Communities received the largest of thousands of compensation awards from the USDA. It was chief arbitrator Michael Lewis's opinion that the USDA's demand for New Communities' timber proceeds \\"smack[ed] of nothing more than a feudal baron demanding additional crops from his serfs.\\" Lewis found the department's actions discriminatory, awarding the former land holders $12.8 million, of about $1 billion paid out to more than 13,300 black farmers ). Two of these land holders, Charles and Shirley Sherrod, received, in addition to their share of the above, $330,000 compensation for mental anguish.  See also  * Community Land Trust * Pigford v.

The church is located in Iowa Falls, Iowa, United States. The parish was established in 1886, and the church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Architecture The church was designed by Robert Layton who was an industrial arts teacher in Iowa Falls. He was born in England and when he visited his home country in 1912 he made sketches of several village churches. From these sketches he drew up the plans for St. Matthew's. Louis and Ernie Welden, two of his students, assisted with making the blueprints. The building is located along the Iowa River. Because of its rather precarious location, parishioners often refer to the church as St. Matthew's on the Brink. with It is a wood frame structure that is rectangular in shape and measures . The exterior is covered with stucco and the gable ends give a simple simulated half-timbered effect. An addition with a shed roof was added onto the rear of the church in the 1960s to provide space for the vicar's study, classrooms, and storage. The interior remains basically unchanged since it was first built. The altar is along the east wall of the sanctuary. The aisle is left of center with the pews along the north wall. The structural system on the inside consists of King posts, Queen posts, collar beams and struts which enhance the vertical character of the space. The stained glass window over the altar depicts the Ascension of Jesus and was added in 1965. Four other windows depicting Apostles were added between 1980 and 1987. The building is significant for its simple design in the Tudor Revival mode.

In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the medial graph of plane graph G is another graph M(G) that represents the adjacencies between edges in the faces of G. Medial graphs were introduced in 1922 by Ernst Steinitz to study combinatorial properties of convex polyhedra, although the inverse construction was already used by Peter Tait in 1877 in his foundational study of knots and links.  Formal definition  Given a connected plane graph G, its medial graph M(G) has * a vertex for each edge of G and * an edge between two vertices for each face of G in which their corresponding edges occur consecutively. The medial graph of a disconnected graph is the disjoint union of the medial graphs of each connected component. The definition of medial graph also extends without modification to graph embeddings on surfaces of higher genus.  Properties  isomorphic. * The medial graph of any plane graph is a 4-regular plane graph. * For any plane graph G, the medial graph of G and the medial graph of the dual graph of G are isomorphic. Conversely, for any 4-regular plane graph H, the only two plane graphs with medial graph H are dual to each other. * Since the medial graph depends on a particular embedding, the medial graph of a planar graph is not unique; the same planar graph can have non-isomorphic medial graphs. In the picture, the red graphs are not isomorphic because the two vertices with self loops share an edge in one graph but not in the other. * Every 4-regular plane graph is the medial graph of some plane graph. For a connected 4-regular plane graph H, a planar graph G with H as its medial graph can be constructed as follows. Color the faces of H with just two colors, which is possible since H is Eulerian (and thus the dual graph of H is bipartite). The vertices in G correspond to the faces of a single color in H. These vertices are connected by an edge for each vertex shared by their corresponding faces in H. Note that performing this construction using the faces of the other color as the vertices produces the dual graph of G. * The medial graph of a 3-regular plane graph coincides with its line graph. However, this is not true for medial graphs of plane graphs that have vertices of degree greater than three.  Applications  For a plane graph G, twice the evaluation of the Tutte polynomial at the point (3,3) equals the sum over weighted Eulerian orientations in the medial graph of G, where the weight of an orientation is 2 to the number of saddle vertices of the orientation (that is, the number of vertices with incident edges cyclically ordered \\"in, out, in out\\"). Since the Tutte polynomial is invariant under embeddings, this result shows that every medial graph has the same sum of these weighted Eulerian orientations. Directed medial graph A plane graph (in blue) and its directed medial graph (in red). The medial graph definition can be extended to include an orientation. First, the faces of the medial graph are colored black if they contain a vertex of the original graph and white otherwise. This coloring causes each edge of the medial graph to be bordered by one black face and one white face. Then each edge is oriented so that the black face is on its left. A plane graph and its dual do not have the same directed medial graph; their directed medial graphs are the transpose of each other. Using the directed medial graph, one can effectively generalize the result on evaluations of the Tutte polynomial at (3,3). For a plane graph G, n times the evaluation of the Tutte polynomial at the point (n+1,n+1) equals the weighted sum over all edge colorings using n colors in the directed medial graph of G so that each (possibly empty) set of monochromatic edges forms a directed Eulerian graph, where the weight of a directed Eulerian orientation is 2 to the number of monochromatic vertices.

The election plan was pared down to when Duncanville, Grand Prairie and Mesquite, which would have had rail lines, opted out of joining the agency. DART chose light rail transit as its primary mode of rail transportation. The plan was pared down again to after a bond vote. After that vote, the agency again pared down the regional rail system to . A DART Blue Line train enters Pearl/Arts District station. = Starter system = After years of scandals involving finances, delays in construction of the rail system, a failed bond election, and nine pull-out votes (two of which were successful), October 1990 was a turning point for the agency when DART first broke ground on its light rail system. In June 1996, the light rail system began service on time and on budgetKelley, Chris (June 16, 1996) \\"Last original staffer delivered train on time, within budget\\". The Dallas Morning News, p. 31A. inaugurating the first light rail system in Texas and the Southwest. Commuter rail service to Irving began in December, after some delays. To the surprise of critics, the new light rail system was embraced by Dallasites, with ridership exceeding expectations. The suburbs' confidence in DART was also expressed at the ballot box: four cities held highly publicized pullout elections in 1996 (with the financial assistance of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones who wanted DART's half-cent sales tax revenue for Texas Stadium in Irving, the Cowboys' home at the timeKeep DART in Irving - Dallas Business Journal), but all four voted to remain in DART (three of them by margins of more than two-to-one). The starter system opened on June 14, 1996, comprising the from the Westmoreland Road in West Oak Cliff through downtown Dallas to Pearl Street, and the from Pearl Street to Morrell Station and Illinois Avenue. The next stage of the starter line opened on January 10, 1997 when the was extended from Pearl Station to Park Lane Station. It includes the tunnel from Pearl Street to Mockingbird Lane, the latter being the site of Dallas's first modern transit village. The northern terminus of the remained Pearl Station at that time. The starter line was completed when the was extended from Illinois Station to Ledbetter Drive. This came on May 31, 1997, nearly one year after the first part of the starter system opened. The final change to the starter system came on December 18, 2000 when DART opened Cityplace Station (now called Cityplace/Uptown Station), the first subway station in the Southwest, in the tunnel between Pearl and Mockingbird Lane under the Tower at Cityplace skyscraper, providing access to the Tower as well as Cityplace West. It was the system's first in-fill stop. Commuter rail on the old Rock Island right-of-way began during the series of openings of the light rail starter system. On December 30, 1996 the opened the first segment as the South Irving Transit Center was connected to Union Station in downtown Dallas with a stop in the middle at Medical/Market Center Station. The agency had to lease rail cars due to a delay in the current stock until that March. Hampton Station. = Suburban expansion = After the success of the light rail starter system, voters approved DART's request to use long-term bonds to expedite the construction of the regional light rail system. While DART had originally planned single-track extensions of the Blue Line to Garland and the Red Line to Richardson and Plano, the starter system was so popular that the agency made plans to double-track the entire route. Work began on the extensions of both the and the on January 15, 1999. Later that same year, on September 27, the Blue Line designation was extended to Mockingbird Lane, for its eventual expansion to Garland. The first station since 1997 to open came on September 24, 2001, when the was extended from Mockingbird Station to the new White Rock. Later, the Blue Line was further extended east outside the LBJ Loop when the LBJ/Skillman Station opened on May 6, 2002. The first extension of the Red Line opened on July 1, 2002 when the line was extended 7 stations north from a newly rebuilt Park Lane Station to Galatyn Parkway. Richardson became the first Dallas suburb to be served by light rail. The Blue Line was completed to Garland on November 18, 2002, making it the second suburb to get light rail service. The two new stations of Forest/Jupiter Station and Downtown Garland Station were opened to the public. The final stage of north- central and northeast \\"suburban\\" light rail expansion opened six months ahead of schedule when the Red Line extension to Downtown Plano and Parker Road opened on December 9, 2002, providing light rail service to Plano for the first time, and completing the current configuration of the Red Line. = 2030 Plan = In October 2006, the DART Board of Directors unanimously approved a long-term \\"2030 Plan\\", which included the following proposals for its next round of rail expansion: *A light rail extension of the to Bonnie View Road and Interstate 20 to a new SouthPort intermodal port in southeast Dallas. *A light rail extension of the south to Red Bird Lane. *A light rail extension of the along Scyene Road to approximately Masters Drive. The line would branch off the Green Line east of Lawnview Avenue. *A light rail line in West Dallas along Fort Worth Avenue or Singleton to Loop 12/Jefferson Boulevard. No color designation was given for this planned line. *A station for the Lake Highlands neighborhood of northeast Dallas on the , between White Rock Station and LBJ/Skillman Station. This area previously opposed rail service, so the tracks were built through the area without a station. Lake Highlands opened on December 6, 2010, becoming the first component of the 2030 plan to be completed and the first infill station in DART's system.DART.org - Blue Line Lake Highlands Station (accessed November 27, 2010) This is a key component of the new Lake Highlands Town Center TOD development. *A nearly Silver Line commuter service in the east-west Cotton Belt corridor from the Red Line in Plano to DFW International Airport. This line would provide rail service to the bus transfer station in Addison and would intersect the at Downtown Carrollton Station. The final 2030 plan included several changes from the draft plan released in July 2006. Removed from the final plan was a branch of the from Forest Lane Station to the Addison Transit Center, which would have included several miles of subway under Interstate 635. DART officials cited the line's high cost, US$700 million, and lack of strong support from the city of Dallas. The extension to the Dallas Southport Center (intermodal terminal) was added after strong pressure from Dallas officials. Also, the proposed light rail line serving West Dallas was not originally considered as a priority for rail service. The Cotton Belt corridor plans continued to generate controversy right up to the day of the vote on the 2030 plan. DART leaned toward diesel powered commuter rail for the Cotton Belt corridor, similar to the . However, the line would pass through affluent Far North Dallas neighborhoods, which formed the Cotton Belt Concerned Coalition to fight the line in 1990. The group lobbied for electric light rail vehicles on the line to avoid perceived air and noise pollution associated with diesel rail, and also proposed that the line be placed in a below-ground trench. These proposals were accepted by the City of Dallas in June 2006 in a unanimous resolution. DART, however, balked at the cost of trenching the line, which they estimated at $250 million. This set up a confrontation between DART and the city of Dallas, which appoints eight of the board's 15 members. The final plan compromised by promising $50 million \\"to help address neighborhood concerns\\". The current Cotton Belt freight corridor runs just south of the Downtown Plano Station on the , but DART maps of the 2030 plan indicated that the commuter rail line would run to the nearby Bush Turnpike station, the nearest station to the south of downtown Plano. The Cotton Belt line would run through former DART member city Coppell between Carrollton and DFW Airport; although no station locations are included in the plan, the promise of a future station could entice Coppell, which withdrew from DART in 1989, into rejoining the agency. In 2010, citing deficits and drops in revenue, DART scrapped much of their 2030 plan. = Green and Orange Line expansion = On July 3, 2006, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) approved a US$700 million Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) -- the largest grant ever awarded to DART -- to kick-start a US$2.5 billion expansion of the light rail system. This phase included two new light rail lines that doubled DART's light rail mileage. Construction began in September 2006. Upon completion of the project in 2013, the size of DART's light rail system doubled to . In maps before 2006, DART labeled the Pleasant Grove to Carrollton route the \\"Orange Line\\", and the Irving route was the \\"Purple Line\\". Green was generally used on DART maps to denote the route of the . By the time construction started, DART was using the new Green Line designation as part of its marketing efforts, saying \\"Like the color green, this line is a symbol of our city on the move.\\" The began operation on September 14, 2009 with a route from downtown Dallas southeast to Fair Park; this short route was scheduled to open in time to service the 2009 State Fair of Texas. On December 6, 2010 the line extended further at both ends - to Pleasant Grove, as well as continuing northwest from Victory Station to Farmers Branch and Carrollton; both extensions, completing the Green Line. The Green Line's northern end connects with the A-train line run by the Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA). This line connects Denton to Carrollton, with stops in Lewisville and Highland Village. The commuter train may stop in other Denton County cities, should they choose to join the DCTA. The second line, the originates at LBJ/Central on the Red Line and runs concurrently with the Red Line to downtown, then with the Green Line to northwest of Love Field Airport at Bachman Lake, where it branches off toward Irving, then continuing to DFW International Airport. DART is cooperating with Love Field to link that airport to the Orange Line, but service is currently connected by a bus shuttle. The line runs through Las Colinas and connects to the Las Colinas APT System. DART had preliminary plans for the to run concurrently with the from downtown Dallas to LBJ/Central Station. The line ends at LBJ/Central Station with rush hour service to Parker Road Station. The first Orange Line stations opened on July 30, 2012, while service to Belt Line Station in Irving began on December 3, 2012. An extension of the Orange Line from Belt Line Station to DFW Airport Station opened on August 18, 2014. = Downtown Dallas (D2) Transit Study = In 2007, DART recognized that with Blue and Red Line trains sharing tracks through the Dallas Central Business District corridor, and the Orange and Green Lines also using this trunk segment through downtown, a single alignment would not have the capacity to support all four rail lines. Under a 1990 agreement with the City of Dallas, DART agreed to build a second rail alignment through downtown once certain operating or ridership figures were met, and DART projected that it would hit these targets by the early 2010s. As a result, DART commissioned its Downtown Dallas Transit Study, known as the D2 Study, to study the possibility of building a second rail alignment through downtown. In spring 2008, DART announced it had considered 16 possible plans for a second rail alignment, and selected four for more detailed consideration. All four proposals provided for an alignment between Victory Station and Deep Ellum Station, indicating the D2 alignment would be used for Green and Orange Line service while the Red and Blue Lines would continue to use the existing alignment. However, on April 27, 2010, DART announced financial problems would prevent it from funding construction of the D2 alignment, putting the plan in limbo. After a three-year hiatus, DART announced on February 6, 2013 that it would begin holding public hearings on \\"Phase II\\" of the D2 study, to discuss alternatives and refinements to its D2 options since it ended \\"Phase I\\" of the D2 study in 2010. At a public hearing on February 13, 2013, DART announced it was expanding to consider eight possible D2 alignments, some of which would connect to Union Station instead of Victory Station and thus provide Red and Blue Line service. While the D2 Study is being funded by a $700,000 grant, the $500 million to $1 billion alignment is unfunded, and construction is not expected to begin before 2025. In August 2015, the Dallas City Council voted to only recommend an alignment above-ground along Jackson Street, over the objections of DART officials, who requested the addition of a Young Street route as a fallback. The alignment along Young Street was opposed by the First Presbyterian Church of Dallas, as the light rail would run through its property. However, the church and local residents, along with structural issues (the local library would have to be demolished, and many historic buildings would be close to or within the path of the line), helped to form an opposition to the new Jackson locally preferred alternative (LPA). Due to this, the City of Dallas voted against the Jackson alignment and instead for the alignment to be in a subway for the majority of its time in downtown. This led DART to have to reconsider the alignment, and also balance funding for the Silver Line, which created tension between supporters of both rail lines, who believed that only one of the two could be built. However, DART eventually voted in favor of eventually funding the Cotton Belt and D2. DART is considering three alignments, all of which are underground for a majority of their routes. A decision will be made by 2018 as to which route will be pitched to the FTA, although city leaders have endorsed the Commerce subway route (along with a downtown streetcar design) to move forward into consideration. = Platform extensions = A two-car SLRV on the existing long platform at NL College on the Orange Line (the pantographs are each over the low floor sections of the train) To allow for more capacity the \\"platform extensions\\" will be completed before tunneling on the D2 corridor starts. This project allows for three-car trains during rush hour. There are 28 stations on the red and blue line that will be rebuilt at an estimated cost of $129 million. The planning for the platform extensions started in 2014 and the construction was approved in 2017. Regular operation of three-car trains is expected for 2022. In March 2018 the contract was awarded to Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam (LAN). Construction started in July 2019 to be finished in August 2022. Apart from capacity the project allows for barrier-free access to trains even on the oldest lines of the network. The platforms will be raised to the floor height of the low-floor middle section of the SLRV trains. This concept allows to get half of the funding from the Teax Mobility Funds. Almost another half of the funding comes from federal resources leaving mostly the planning costs to DART, which is below ten million. The project has accordingly two phases. In the first phase the platforms are raised by on their existing length. In the second phase the platforms are extendrd from their original to accommodate long trains. A common street-level station will have side platforms of length with a raised boarding area of . At each end crossings and ramps are built. The Orange and Green Lines had been constructed to that standard from the beginning. However they could not use that length in regular operation. The platform extensions were part of the initial planning of system with reserved space on each station since the 1980s. However, this concept was expecting a possibility of four-car trains with the LRV type vehicles of the time. The newer SRLV have that length with three-car trains already. The raised and underground stations had been constructed at from the beginning but it is a higher effort to rebuild them to a raised platform in the first phase due to existing stairs. Current lines Downtown Plano Station in Plano =Red Line= The runs from southwest to northeast, from Westmoreland Station, in southwest Dallas, to Parker Road Station in Plano. Heading north from Westmoreland, the line provides service to Dallas Convention Center, Union Station, and the Dallas Central Business District, then follows Central Expressway (US 75) through north Dallas, Richardson and Plano. =Blue Line= The runs from southwest to northeast, UNT Dallas, in southwest Dallas, to Downtown Rowlett Station in Rowlett. Heading north from UNT Dallas, the line provides service to Dallas Convention Center, Union Station, and the Dallas Central Business District, then turns northeast, providing service to White Rock Lake, Garland, and Rowlett. Green Line train passing The Traveling Man at Deep Ellum Station in Dallas =Green Line= The runs from Buckner Station, near Loop 12 in southeast Dallas, to North Carrollton/Frankford Station in Carrollton in the northwest. Heading north from Buckner, the line serves Fair Park, Deep Ellum, and the Dallas Central Business District, then turns northwest along the Interstate 35E (Texas) corridor, serving the American Airlines Center, Parkland Hospital, Love Field, Farmers Branch, and Carrollton, where a transfer is available to the A-train line run by the Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA). =Orange Line= The runs between Parker Road Station in Plano and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The Orange Line duplicates the Red Line along the Central Expressway (US 75) corridor from Parker Road to the Dallas Central Business District, then follows the Green Line along the Interstate 35E (Texas) corridor, serving the American Airlines Center, Parkland Hospital, and Love Field, before branching west along the Highway 114 corridor to Irving. The final leg of the Orange Line from Belt Line to DFW Airport opened on August 18, 2014.  Operation  The DART light rail system operates seven days a week from 4:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.http://dart.org/schedules/schedules.asp DART Schedules On each individual line, service operates Monday through Friday every 15 minutes during commute periods and every 20 minutes middays and early evening, while operating every 30 minutes after approximately 10 p.m. On Saturday and Sunday, service operates every 20 minutes between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m., and every 30 minutes early morning and at night. Portions of the system have headways cut in half where at least two lines share rail tracks, with all four lines which converge in downtown Dallas along the Pacific Avenue/Bryan Street corridor commanding headways of 3.5 minutes at the most to 5‚Äì7 minutes at the least.

Together We Stand, Harper Collins, 2005, pp 109-12, 135, 181-2, 499, 720, 728. Early life She was born, in the throes of the First World War, in Rudnik nad Sanem, a forested estate near Tarnobrzeg, a town in south-eastern Poland founded by her Tarnowski family in 1593. She was the granddaughter of Count Stanislaw Tarnowski (1837‚Äì1917), Professor and Rector at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow (his home, the Szlak, in the past having been the resting place of deceased Polish kings on the night before burial at Wawel), and direct descendant of Catherine the Great of Russia. Her family had held some of the highest offices in Poland. She spent her childhood roaming the freedom of the wide open spaces, the farms and the forests of the estate. In 1937, she married Andrew Tarnowski, a member of the senior branch of the family. Her first son was under two when he died (on the day she gave birth to her second) in July 1939.  World War II =Expulsion= At the outbreak of war, relentless bombing forced Tarnowska and her husband to leave their home. As a gesture of commitment never to leave Polish soil, she burnt her passport. Sadly, events forced a different outcome. Tarnowska and her companions, including her brother, determined to join the front-line troops' bid to expel the German army from Polish soil; for a fortnight they criss-crossed Poland by car, in this vain attempt, finally forced to cross the border into Romania, reaching Bucharest. As sympathy for the Nazi cause grew in Bucharest, they decided to leave and head for Belgrade. The Serbs made them welcome. They travelled through the Balkans, where her baby died. They travelled on, ending up in Palestine, where her marriage broke down. =Cairo= Separated from her husband, she left Palestine and travelled to Cairo where she and her sister-in-law were looked after by Prince Youssef Kamal ed-Dine (a visitor to Poland before the War) and made welcome by all. She began working for the International Red Cross, tracing missing Allied soldiers. General Sikorski, the Polish Prime Minister-in-Exile and Commander- in-Chief visited Cairo in November 1941. At his request, she set up the Cairo branch of the Polish Red Cross with the help of Lady Lampson, wife of Sir Miles Lampson, the British Ambassador and Sir Duncan Mackenzie of the British Red Cross. She became friends with King Farouk and Queen Farida. As Rommel advanced into Egypt in June 1942 after the fall to Tobruk, to within 100 km of Alexandria, Cairo was evacuated. She was living at the National Hotel. Many of her contemporaries left for Palestine but she refused to leave and carried on working for the Polish Red Cross until everyone else had left and there was nothing more that she could do. She was ordered to leave for Palestine by the Polish Legation. She refused and instead set off defiantly for the front, to Alexandria, to be near the troops within earshot of First Battle of El Alamein. There she stayed in an hotel, as the only guest, all others having fled. As Rommel's advance was halted, she returned to Cairo in July 1942 to welcome the returning evacuees. =Tara= In 1943, Capt Bill Stanley Moss had found, by sheer chance, a spacious villa in Gezira Island, boasting a great ballroom with parquet floors which four or five people might share rather than live in the SOE hostel, \\"Hangover Hall\\". He moved in alone at first, then bought his Alsatian puppy, Pixie (whose mother had been a POW), then Xan Fielding, who had worked in Crete, joined him. Next was Tarnowska, followed by Arnold Breene of SOE HQ. Finally Patrick Leigh Fermor, an SOE officer who had spent the previous nine months in Crete, joined the household.Moss, W. Stanley, Diary, 1944Moss, W. Stanley. Ill Met by Moonlight, George G Harrap and Co, 1950. The Folio Society, 2001 pp 19, 43, 57, 186 The villa's new inhabitants called it Tara ‚Äì the legendary home of the High Kings of Ireland.Cooper, Artemis, Cairo in the War 1939-1945, Hamish Hamilton 1989 Tarnowska and two other women had been asked to share the house with the SOE agents but the other two dropped out. The men pleaded with her not to let them down. So she moved in with her few possessions (a bathing costume, an evening gown, a uniform and two pet mongooses), her reputation in the all-male household protected by an entirely fictitious chaperone, Madame Khayatt, who suffered from \\"distressingly poor health\\" and was always indisposed when visitors called. They were later joined SOE agents Billy McLean, David Smiley returning from Albania, (\\"David deciding that it would be cheaper to live in Tara than to come in every day and be tapped by the cook or Abdul for money to pay for meals\\") and Rowland Winn (later Lord St. Oswald) also active in Albania. Tara became the most exciting place in the city, the centre of high- spirited entertaining of diplomats, officers, writers, lecturers, war correspondents and Coptic and Levantine party-goers, under the guiding hand of Princess Dneiper-Petrovsk (Countess Sophie Tarnowska) and the young buccaneers - Sir Eustace Rapier (Lt-Col. Neil (Billy) McLean), the Marquis of Whipstock (Col David Smiley LVO OBE MC), the Hon, Rupert Sabretache (Rowland Winn MC), Lord Hughe Devildrive (Major Xan Fielding DSO), Lord Pintpot (Arnold Breene), Lord Rakehell (Lt-Col Patrick Leigh-Fermor DSO) and Mr Jack Jargon (Capt W. Stanley Moss MC). Tarnowska drew on memories of liqueur-making on her father's estates to produce the party drinks, adding plums, apricots and peaches to raw alcohol (as a substitute for vodka) purchased from the local garage, in the bath. The results were disappointing as, rather than being left to mature for three weeks, the mixture was drunk after three days. At the end of their first ball, Leigh Fermor fell asleep on a sofa which ignited, before it was thrown burning into the garden below. Over the course of the winter of 1943, a piano was borrowed from the Egyptian Officers' Club, lightbulbs were shot out, On one occasion, King Farouk arrived at the villa with a crate of champagne. By the winter of 1944, the Tara household had to leave their rather battered villa and move into a flat. Their landlord finally secured their eviction on the grounds that the villa had not been let to Princess Dneiper-Petrovsk et al., as stated on the villa's name plate. Tarnowka's sojourn in North Africa features prominently in a book on the history of the period.James Holland, Together We Stand: North Africa 1942-1943: Turning the Tide in the West, 2006 Family Riverstown House, County Cork.

Bill Stanley Moss died in 1965 in Kingston, Jamaica. =Return to Poland= When Tarnowska left her father's home at Rudnik at the outbreak of war in 1939, he gave her for safe-keeping the personal standard, the \\"proporzec\\", of the seventeenth- century King Karl Gustav of Sweden, who with his army was famously defeated on the Tarnowski estate. In 1957 she and her brother (also living in London) decided to give this standard to the Wawel museum in Krakow (where it remains); the Communist government was keen to make as much as possible of this event, and granted them visas, but she refused all offers of expenses- paid travel and hospitality.Hickey, William, Daily Express, 20 April 1957 They both travelled to Poland and were allowed to revisit Rudnik, where they were given an emotional welcome. After the fall of communism, her nephew was eventually able to buy back Rudnik - sadly dilapidated, now gradually being restored - and she and her brother presided over several family gatherings there. =Later years= For much of the latter part of her life, she divided her time between London and spending her summer months returning to Ireland.

Mickie Finn's nightclub in 1968 Mickie Finn's (also known as Mickey Finn's) was a nightclub in San Diego, California, established in 1960 by piano player Fred E. Finn (Fred Soetje) and his wife Barbara, who used the stage name 'Mickie Finn'. Finn later extended the brand to a second club in Beverly Hills, a television show on NBC in 1966, a series of compilation record albums issued from 1966 on, and a stage show continuing on into the 21st century.  Nightclub  Fred and Barbara Soetje opened Mickie Finn's on October 28, 1960. They converted an old warehouse on University Avenue in the Hillcrest neighborhood of San Diego, into a \\"Gay '90s‚ÄìRoaring '20s‚ÄìSwinging '30s\\" nightclub. Finn was a piano player from San Francisco and had recently received a business administration degree from San Jose State College.Red Watson webpage from the Jazz Banjo website He considered Washington and Hawaii for his planned nightclub, but chose San Diego because of logistics ‚Äî he could not afford to transport his collection of old nickelodeons, 1890s pictures, and various turn-of-the-century items, which he planned to use as \\"atmosphere\\" for his new club, to the more distant locations. Mickie Finn's had seating for 600 people, but often had larger crowds. The nightclub grossed over $250,000 in its first year. Over the next fourteen years, four-million customers consumed 250,000 gallons of beer. Banjo player Red Watson, Finn's musical partner in San Francisco, played at the club until 1965, when he moved on to play in Las Vegas. Finn's wife then played banjo at the club until the couple divorced in 1973. Finn promoted the club with various publicity stunts. He raced a 1927 Seagraves fire engine at the El Cajon Speedway, and he fired an old cannon after every score by the San Diego Chargers football team at all home games.Churnin, Nancy \\"Recall Mickey Finn Show? It's Stomping Back to S. D.\\" San Diego Spotlight: Stage section of the LOS ANGELES TIMES (June 8, 1990) available online at the online Los Angeles Times archive In the early 1970s, the Finns opened a second Mickie Finn's nightclub in Beverly Hills on Restaurant Row, in the new Los Angeles Emporium. The San Diego location closed in 1974. Finn's second wife, Cathy, took over the banjo duties from 1980 on.  Summer TV show  In 1965, Finn he was approached by a television producer Bill Yagemann about doing a television series, which was named after the club.Mickie Finn's webpage on the HARMONIZE.COM website Mickie Finn's was a summer replacement series for the failed NBC sitcom Mona McCluskey, which had starred Juliette Prowse and Denny Miller on Thursday nights. The show's Nielsen ratings were better than for its sitcom predecessor, but were not competitive with ABC's hit Peyton Place in the time slot. NBC did not renew the show for the 1966-1967 Fall season.  Record albums and singles  Dunhill Records, run by Lou Adler, signed Fred E. and Mickie Finn in 1966, during the run of their television show. Up through the late 1970s, Dunhill issued their singles (sometimes in simultaneous batches of four or five), and several albums (Mickie Finn's Live, Mickie Finn's: America's #1 Speakeasy, The Now Sound of Mickie Finn's, and Saturday Night at Mickie Finn's). Neither the albums nor the singles ever \\"climbed the charts\\", but are sold today as collectors items worldwide.  Stage show  After the television show went off the air, the Mickie Finn stage show began headlining, in October, 1966, at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, and continued on to play other Las Vegas clubs until 1988. Fred Finn, with second wife Cathy on banjo, brought the show back to San Diego twice: first, in 1988, for four performances at the Fiesta Dinner Theatre, and again, in June 1990, for one month at the Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre produced in association with Scott Pedersen. From 1990 on, Fred Finn continued his stageshow presence throughout the US from a base in Florida, slightly changing the name from Mickie Finn's' to Mickey Finn's.Mickey Finn Stage Show website  References   External links  * Mickey Finn Stage Show * Mickie Finn's webpage on the Internet Movie Database website Category:Nightclubs in California Category:Culture of San Diego ","title":"Mickie Finn's"},{"id":"28280945","text":"Beatrice von Dovsky Beatrice von Dovsky (14 November 1866, Vienna ‚Äì 18 July 1923, Vienna) was an Austrian poet, writer, and actress. She is best known for writing the libretto for Max von Schillings's opera Mona Lisa which she presented to the composer in the spring of 1913. The subject was very topical at the time, because the painting by Leonardo da Vinci had been stolen from the Louvre in 1911, and rediscovered in Florence in 1913. The opera premiered successfully at the Staatsoper Stuttgart in September 1915, and, while not part of the standard opera repertory, has been commercially recorded three times and revived numerous times by major opera houses throughout the 20th century. Dovsky's other works include poems, short stories and works for children. Her fairy tales are among her more well known works, including Der Wiener Fratz, Die Gn√§' Frau, and Zw√∂lf M√§rchen aus der Ostmark among others. She was also active as a stage actress in Vienna.

Early life Blount was born on 15 June 1690 probably at the family seat, Mapledurham House at Mapledurham in Oxfordshire. She was educated first at Hammersmith in Middlesex, probably at the Roman Catholic convent there, and afterwards in the Rue Boulanger in Paris. Her father was Lister Blount, and her family had long been of the highest position among Roman Catholic gentry. Pope and literary society It is not known when Blount and Pope first met. Her family and his were in close friendship in 1710, in which year her father and her maternal grandfather died, both on the same day; from a story which she told Spence, it may be assumed that Pope and she were in the habit of meeting on easy terms as early as about 1705. Teresa Blount, portrait by Charles Jervas From 1710 to 1715 Blount continued to live at Mapledurham with her widowed mother, her brother, Michael, and her sister, Teresa. During this period she and her sister were prominent figures in the fashionable world. In 1712 Pope sent them his 'Rape of the Lock' and his ‚ÄòMiscellany‚Äô (Carruthers, p. 79); in 1713 the sisters were corresponding with James Moore Smythe, author of the comedy The Rival Modes, he as Alexis, Teresa as Zephalinda, and Martha as Parthenissa; in 1714 Pope wrote to Martha from Bath that if she would come she would be the best mermaid in Christendom; in 1715 he had two fans painted for the sisters. John Gay called them \\"two lovely sisters\\" (Gay to Pope, Welcome from Greece), Pope spoke of their \\"endless smiles\\" (Epistle to Jervas, line 61) and of Martha's \\"resistless charms\\" (his Epistle to her with Voiture's works, line 59). In their portraits, still at Mapledurham, where they appear arm in arm, they both look very charming. If Martha's brother had died unmarried, Mapledurham would have become her property. However, in 1715, Michael Blount married Mary Agnes, eldest daughter and coheiress of Sir Henry Joseph Tichborne, 4th Baronet, so Martha with her mother and sister thenceforth had a country residence at Petersham, costing ¬£20 a year, and a town house, at one time in Bolton Street, at another in Welbeck Street (Pope to Caryll, 6 May 1733). The change in her fortunes called out Pope's warm pity. He had reason, too, to think that her mother, sister, and brother treated her unkindly; and though at first he was the friend of both sisters, having even settled 40l. a year on Teresa in 1717 for six years (Carruthers, p. 75), he quarrelled with the latter lady before long, and showed so much preference and partisanship for Martha, that it was the cause of rumours which seriously affected her honour. His ‚ÄòBirthday Poem‚Äô to her in 1723 strengthened these rumours; his letters, however, vehemently declared them to be false (to Caryll, Christmas Day, 1725, &c.;), and he attributed the scandal to Teresa. Pope, indeed, advised Martha to leave her mother and sister altogether when this calumny was abroad, but she refused the advice. Alexander Pope In 1732 Martha Blount seems to have been seriously ill, under Dr. John Arbuthnot's care. In 1733 Pope's mother died, to whom Martha had always shown affectionate attention. In 1735 Pope dedicated his 'Epistle on Women' to her, telling her she had \\"sense, good humour, and a poet\\". In 1739 her brother died, leaving children to whom she was much attached. In 1743, after the death of her mother, she paid a memorable visit to the Allens at Prior Park, where Pope was staying. Ruffhead says she behaved during the visit in an arrogant and unbecoming manner; Warburton and Warton say she ‚Äòtook the huff‚Äô because the Allens, as Protestants, refused to let their carriage take her to a Roman Catholic chapel; she says (Mapledurham MSS., Carruthers, p. 378): ‚ÄòThey talk to one another without putting me at all into the conversation. ‚Ä¶ I'll get out of it as soon as I can.‚Äô Pope defended her; called Mrs. Allen ‚Äòa minx, and an impertinent one,‚Äô and, after his own departure, advised her to ‚Äòleave them without a word.‚Äô Pope was seized with his last illness a few weeks after this unhappy episode. Ralph Allen went to see him, to find him still eager in Martha Blount's defense. Samuel Johnson relates that during Pope's last illness he saw Miss Blount in his garden, and sent for her, and (what is incredible) that Martha met the messenger (Lord Marchmont) with a callous cry, ‚ÄòWhat! not dead yet!‚Äô Maynard Mack, Pope's definitive biographer, notes, \\"It is impossible to be sure whence Johnson had this story, so obviously intended to discredit Martha,\\" and adds that \\"It would come quite plausibly... from any source close to Warburton, who hated Bolingbroke\\" and \\"did not care for Martha Blount.(Mack, M. (1985). Alexander Pope: A Life. Yale University Press: London.\\" Mack takes a more sympathetic interpretation of Martha in this story, stating that, \\"To be sure, Martha may have made the remark in question and perhaps in these very words. One would still, before judging her, need to know how close in tone she came to 'What, is he not yet out of his pain?' - which is to say, 'Am I not out of mine? Mack, M. (1985). Alexander Pope: A Life. Yale University Press: London.'\\" Pope bequeathed to Miss Blount 1,000l., three score of his books, his household goods, chattels, and plate, the furniture of his grotto, the urns in his garden, and the residue after all legacies were paid. Post Pope life Miss Blount retained her place in the fashionable world after Pope's death. She lived at last in Berkeley Row, by Hanover Square, and there Henry Swinburne the traveller, her relative, visited her (Roscoe, i. 581 note). He found her a little, neat, fair, prim old woman, easy and gay in her manners. By her will she left the residue of her property to her \\"dear nephew,\\" Michael Blount, of Mapledurham. She died in 1762, aged 72. A pleasing portrait is in Ayre's Pope, vol. ii. facing page 17.

Trained in London, Hope moved to Knoxville in 1795, where he designed and built several of the city's earliest houses. At least two houses built by Hope-- the Ramsey House (1797) in East Knoxville and Statesview (ca. 1806) in West Knoxville-- are still standing, and have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Lisa Oakley, Thomas Hope. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 6 August 2010. Biography Hope was born in Kent, England, in 1757, and learned the house construction trade in London. During the 1780s, he moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he had been hired to build a house for South Carolina planter Ralph Izard. This house stood on Broad Street in Charleston for several decades. During the early 1790s, Hope lived in Cheraw, South Carolina, where he married his wife, Elizabeth Large, in 1793. Hope then moved to Knoxville, which at the time was the capital of the Southwest Territory, in 1795.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: The Society, 1972), pp. 428-429. Hope's first project in Knoxville was the Ramsey House, or Swan Pond, a two-story Georgian- style house completed in 1797. Hope found ample work in Knoxville, a burgeoning frontier town in need of professional builders. In the decade after completing the Ramsey House, Hope built a residence known as \\"Trafalgar\\" for planter John Kain, overlooking the Holston River in Knox County. Around 1806, Hope completed the Federal-style Statesview for surveyor Charles McClung in what is now West Knoxville. In 1812, Hope built a house, later known as \\"Maison de Sante,\\" for Knoxville physician Joseph C. Strong, which stood at the corner of State Street and Cumberland Avenue. In addition to house construction, Hope co-founded a carpenters' guild in Knoxville in 1801. The original design of the James Park House in Knoxville, built in approximately 1812, is sometimes attributed to Hope.William MacArthur, Jr., Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South (Tulsa, Oklahoma: Continental Heritage Press, 1982), p. 23. In 1816, Hope received several payments from Thomas Humes (1767-1816), builder of the Lamar House Hotel, suggesting that Hope may have played a role in the hotel's original design (although there is little else to support this).Dean Novelli, \\"On a Corner of Gay Street: A History of the Lamar House‚ÄîBijou Theater, Knoxville, Tennessee, 1817 ‚Äì 1985.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 56 (1984), p. 4. Hope's last project was the original Rotherwood Mansion, built for Presbyterian clergyman Frederick Augustus Ross in what is now Kingsport, Tennessee. After Hope's death in 1820, his son oversaw Rotherwood's completion. Style Hope's influences included English architect Christopher Wren (1632-1723) and contemporary American architect Charles Bulfinch.Elizabeth Bowman Skaggs and Stanley Folmsbee, \\"The Ramsey House: Home of Francis Alexander Ramsey,\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Vol. XXIV, No. 3 (Fall 1965), p. 204. Many of Hope's designs were inspired by William Pain's 1781 book, The Builder's Golden Rule, which Hope carried with him on his various projects. Hope typically used a mix of Georgian and Federal architectural styles, depending on his clients' needs. =Buildings= Hope is known to have built the following: *The Ralph Izard House, circa 1788, on Broad Street in Charleston, South Carolina; no longer standing. *The Ramsey House, or Swan Pond, in East Knoxville, Tennessee, completed 1797. Built of locally-quarried Tennessee marble and limestone around a central hall floor plan; contains hand-carved cornices. The house is now a museum. *Statesview, built circa 1806 in the Ebenezer community (now part of West Knoxville, Tennessee). Designed in the Federal style, this house's original layout was altered somewhat after it was damaged by fire in 1823. The house is now a private residence. *Trafalgar, built circa 1806 along the Holston River in Knox County; no longer standing. *Joseph Strong House, built circa 1812 in Knoxville; demolished in 1971 to make way for highway construction. *Rotherwood, built in 1820 in Boatyard, Tennessee (now Kingsport). This mansion burned in 1865, and was replaced shortly thereafter by the current Rotherwood Mansion. Furniture Hope supplied furniture for many of the houses he constructed. A ledger owned by War Department agent David Henley shows that Hope also supplied furniture for Tellico agent Silas Dinsmore in the mid-1790s.Ann McPherson, \\"Adaptation and Reinterpretation: The Transfer of Furniture Styles from Philadelphia to Winchester to Tennessee.\\" Chipstone Foundation website. Retrieved: 6 August 2010. In his Autobiography, historian J. G. M. Ramsey (1797-1884), the son of Francis Alexander Ramsey, for whom the Ramsey House was built, stated that Hope designed a bookcase and desk for the house's library. Since then, a number of furniture pieces from early Knoxville have been attributed to Hope, including a desk and bookcase once owned by early Knox County settler David Campbell. While Hope supplied furniture for some of his patrons, whether he made the furniture pieces or merely acquired them is disputed. Furniture historian Ann McPherson states that certain pieces attributed to Hope contain rococo elements unlikely to be used by Hope, and points out the pieces' resemblance to a cabinet-making style that originated in the Winchester, Virginia area in the late eighteenth century. Legacy The Ramsey House and Statesview are the only two surviving structures known to have been built by Thomas Hope. The James Park House, which still stands in downtown Knoxville, is sometimes attributed to Hope, although its original design has been modified numerous times. The destruction of the Joseph Strong House in 1971 sparked an outcry from preservationists, and was one of the events that led to the establishment of the Knoxville-area preservation group Knox Heritage. In 1868, Thomas Hope's great-grandsons, David James Hope and John W. Hope, opened Hope Brothers Jewelry, which operated out of a shop on Gay Street into the twentieth century. In 1897, the Hope brothers erected a street clock in front of their store that remained a landmark in downtown Knoxville for over a century. The Hope Brothers Jewelry Store became Kimball's Jewelry in 1933, and in 2004, Kimball's relocated to West Knoxville, and took the Hope clock with them. The City of Knoxville erected a new street clock to replace the Hope clock in 2007.Jack Neely, New Hope. Metro Pulse, 6 December 2007. Accessed at the Internet Archive, 2 October 2015. In 1924, Hope's great-great-grandson, Albert Guinn Hope (1869-1955), built a house, \\"Hopecote,\\" on what is now part of the University of Tennessee campus in Knoxville.

Completed in 1881, it was built by the contractor David S. Strover and master carpenter Joe Stevens. On September 22, 1977, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It serves a parish church in the Episcopal Diocese of Iowa. History The parish was formed on December 1, 1867, by the Rev. W. T. Currie from St. Paul's Church in Durant. It was incorporated the following year. Prior to this, worship services were held occasionally in the Jasper County Courthouse and in Union Hall. Some of the services were conducted by Iowa's first bishop, Henry Washington Lee, who encouraged the mission work in Newton. Property for the church was bought by Thomas Arthur for $825. David S. Stover designed the church and Joseph Stevens was responsible for construction, which began in 1871. The church was completed in 1874, with the exception of the bell tower. The first liturgy was celebrated in the church on April 19, 1874, by Rev. J. Sanders Reed of Des Moines. The building is Carpenter Gothic in design. The stained glass windows are a combination of English, Victorian and Arts-and-Crafts. The organ was bought by Col. Ryan, Thomas Arthur, and Lena Clark for $700. It was first used on Christmas 1874. It is the oldest church in continual use for worship in Newton. with By 1878 the parish had been reduced to 30 communicants. Between 1878 and 1911 the parish was too small to support a priest. With the exception of weddings and funerals, services were not being held. There was also no resident priest during the Great Depression. Rev. Joseph Gregori began to revitalize the parish beginning in 1949 and it became an independent parish in 1962. The education wing was completed the following year. The tower base, which serves as the narthex, was originally on the northeast corner of the main facade. It was moved to the other side in the 1960s and the second level of the tower and the spire were added at that time. They were part of the original plan for the church, but were not built because of a lack of funds. Architecture The sanctuary measures , and the education wing is . The exterior is of the entire complex is covered with board-and-batten siding. Even though the education wing was added almost 90 years after the sanctuary they conform stylistically.

Other architectural elements include short buttresses and small brackets beneath the narrow eaves. A small chancel extends off of the back. The altar, pews, choir stalls, and stained glass windows are from the early years of the church.

The IS-23 was an all-metal aircraft. It had a high cantilever wing with constant chord inboard and slight taper beyond with almost square tips. The wing was equipped with various high lift devices to achieve the required STOL capability. The tail surfaces were constant chord and straight tipped, though the fin and rudder were slightly swept. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage. The rudder was horn balanced, fitted with a trim tab and cut away at the bottom to allow movement of the single piece elevator, also horn balanced. It was powered by a compactly cowled 9-cylinder, 300 hp (220 kW) Ivchenko AI-14RF radial engine. Behind it, the fuselage was flat sided. The cabin stretched from forward of the wing to well behind it with almost continuous glazing on both sides and could accommodate up to six people including the pilot. It could also be configured to carry two stretchers plus attendant and pilot. There were doors to the front seats on both sides and a third, port side, passenger door. Beyond the cabin, the fuselage the straight upper fuselage line continued but sides and bottom tapered to the tail. The IS-23's tall, fixed tricycle undercarriage had each main wheel supported from the fuselage centre line by a pair of asymmetric V-legs with a separate damping strut, mounted on the outer fuselage bottom, attached to the aft one. The wheeled undercarriage could be replaced with either floats or skis. Trials of the IS-23 began in mid 1968. Take off distances, dependent on load, were between 120‚Äì185 m (395‚Äì610 ft) and landings took 60‚Äì80 m (195‚Äì260 ft). The aircraft was later developed into the ICA IS-24, chiefly by replacing the radial engine with a flat 6-cylinder Lycoming, reducing the cabin glazing and lowering and widening the undercarriage.

In 1943, with the help of the Dutch resistance and students of the nearby University of Amsterdam, he was instrumental in saving over 600 Jewish children from the nursery of the Hollandsche Schouwburg who were destined for deportation to Nazi concentration camps. For his humanitarian actions he received the Yad Vashem distinction Righteous Among the Nations from the State of Israel in 1973. Van Hulst served as Senator of the Netherlands from July 1956 to June 1981. He was elected to be the parliamentary leader of the Christian Historical Union (CHU) in the Senate from December 1968 until June 1977, when the CHU merged into the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). He then became the first CDA Leader in the Senate. Van Hulst previously served as the party chair of the CHU from September 1969 until February 1972. He also was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Christian Democratic Group from October 1961 until September 1968. He later was an emeritus professor of pedagogy at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and a prolific author with more than a hundred publications. He was also a noted chess player. Early life Van Hulst was born on 28 January 1911 in Amsterdam, the son of Gerrit van Hulst and Geertruida Hofman. He studied psychology and pedagogy at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In the meantime he worked as a teacher and mentor in Oudewater, Utrecht and Purmerend. Rescue of Jewish children In 1942 van Hulst was the director of the Reformed Teacher Training College, a Protestant religious seminary at Plantage Middenlaan 27, Amsterdam.The Righteous Among The Nations, Hulst van FAMILY at yadvashem.org, accessed 30 March 2018. Across the street at Plantage Middenlaan 24 was the Hollandse Schouwberg theatre, the main clearing site for the Jews living in Amsterdam who had been issued deportation notices by the Nazi government. Children who arrived at the Schouwberg were separated from their families and sent to the neighbouring cr√®che at Plantage Middenlaan 31 run by Henri√´tte Pimentel. The cr√©che shared a back garden with the college that van Hulst directed. Starting in January 1943, Pimentel and Walter S√ºskind, a German Jew who had been appointed by the Nazis to run the Hollandsche Schouwberg operation, began canvassing potential adoptive families for physical descriptions of children who could fit into their families without detection. Once the children's parents had agreed, the names of the children to be rescued were removed from the Nazi's registry of Jews who had passed through the Schouwberg theatre. Then, working with Pimentel, S√ºskind and dozens of other volunteers, Van Hulst arranged for the children to be spirited over the hedge separating the neighbouring back yards of the cr√®che and the teachers' college, often assisted by the teachers-in- training or local university students. When the time came to move the rescued children and babies away from the school, they would be hidden in containers such as bags, sacks or laundry baskets. Numerous methods were used to move the hidden children from the school. In one method, the operation's helpers would wait for the moment a tram passed, blocking the view of Nazi guards at the facing Hollandsche Schouwberg, to cycle away with the hidden child. The operation came to a halt on 29 September 1943 when the Nazis sent Pimentel and 100 children from the cr√®che to Nazi concentration camps. Decades later, Van Hulst described his experience: \\"Now try to imagine 80, 90, perhaps 70 or 100 children standing there, and you have to decide which children to take with you. [...] That was the most difficult day of my life. [...] You know for a fact that the children you leave behind are going to die. I took 12 with me. Later on I asked myself: ‚ÄòWhy not 13?'\\" Van Hulst thought twelve was the right number, otherwise the Germans would notice his plan and shut it down. In total, the operation had rescued between 500 and 1,000 Jewish babies and children. Van Hulst received the Yad Vashem distinction in 1973.statistics/netherlands at yadvashem.org During a visit to the Netherlands in 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said of Van Hulst: \\"We say, those who save one life save a universe. You saved hundreds of universes. I want to thank you in the name of the Jewish people, but also in the name of humanity.\\" Van Hulst replied, talking about the children he could not save: \\"I only can hope the angels may conduct them into paradise.\\" In 2016, the former Reformed Teacher Training College became the Dutch National Holocaust Museum. Shortly before his 107th birthday in 2018, Van Hulst gave an interview on Dutch television, talking about his experiences during the war.107-jarige redde honderden joodse kinderen in de oorlog (107-year-old saved hundreds of Jewish children in the war), NOS Political career =Senate= Van Hulst speaking in the Dutch Senate, February 1963 Van Hulst (centre) in 1969 Van Hulst served a member of the Senate of the Netherlands from 1956 to 1981 and from 1961 until 1968 he was a Member of the European Parliament.

A scheme X is called quasi-separated if the morphism to Spec Z is quasi-separated. Quasi- separated algebraic spaces and algebraic stacks and morphisms between them are defined in a similar way, though some authors include the condition that X is quasi-separated as part of the definition of an algebraic space or algebraic stack X. Quasi-separated morphisms were introduced by as a generalization of separated morphisms. All separated morphisms (and all morphisms of Noetherian schemes) are automatically quasi-separated. Quasi-separated morphisms are important for algebraic spaces and algebraic stacks, where many natural morphisms are quasi-separated but not separated. The condition that a morphism is quasi-separated often occurs together with the condition that it is quasi- compact. Examples *If X is a locally Noetherian scheme then any morphism from X to any scheme is quasi-separated, and in particular X is a quasi- separated scheme. *Any separated scheme or morphism is quasi-separated. *The line with two origins over a field is quasi-separated over the field but not separated. *If X is an \\"infinite dimensional vector space with two origins\\" over a field K then the morphism from X to spec K is not quasi-separated. More precisely X consists of two copies of Spec K[x1,x2,....] glued together by identifying the nonzero points in each copy. *The quotient of an algebraic space by an infinite discrete group acting freely is often not quasi- separated. For example if K is a field of characteristic 0 then the quotient of the affine line by the group Z of integers is an algebraic space that is not quasi-separated. This algebraic space is also an example of a group object in the category of algebraic spaces that is not a scheme; quasi-separated algebraic spaces that are group objects are always group schemes. There are similar examples given by taking the quotient of the group scheme Gm by an infinite subgroup, or the quotient of the complex numbers by a lattice.

Overall, 9000 people were directly affected by the event. History Leh is the largest town in the Ladakh region of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is on a plateau at around above sea level and usually receives very little rainfall, around per year. Described as a \\"high-altitude cold desert\\", the area has sparse rainfall and a heavy downpour is a rare occurrence. The average rainfall in Leh for the month of August is , with highest rainfall ever recorded during a single 24-hour period being , recorded on 22 August 1933. The town is predominantly Buddhist. Tourists are attracted by its natural environment. August is the peak tourist season when thousands of western backpackers come to the area. Leh receives about 60,000 foreign and 150,000 domestic tourists annually. Flooding and damage Condition of the Leh Airfield after the cloud burst, the Runway and required part for operation is already made clear. The flash floods happened after a night of heavy downpour. The cloudburst itself occurred between 0000‚Äì0030 hours IST on 6 August 2010, leading to flash flooding, debris flows, and mudflows over the region. The rainfall distribution was highly spatially variable. The most intense part of the storm was focused in a -wide band parallel to, and a few kilometers from, the river Indus. This band was centred over most of the major settlements in the area, including Leh. Outside the band, the rainfall intensity was unremarkable; the only weather station in the area, at Leh airport, recorded just of total rainfall for the night of 6 August.\\"Cloudburst over Leh\\", report of the Indian Meteorological Department, (url:http://www.imd.gov.in/doc/cloud- burst-over-leh.pdf ).

Estimates of the maximum total rainfall in some places were as high as .Warning from Leh, 15 September 2010. Down To Earth. Accessed 30 January 2011.) Note that the implied of rain over Leh during the most intense part of the storm is equivalent to around a year's worth of rain falling in 30 minutes. The rains occurred at night, and surprised everyone. In Leh, many buildings were destroyed including hospitals, the bus terminal, radio station transmitter, telephone exchange and mobile-phone towers. BSNL communication systems were fully destroyed. Communications were later restored by the Indian Army. The local bus station was severely damaged and some of the buses were carried more than a mile by the mud. The city's airport was damaged but was rapidly repaired to allow relief flights the following day. The village of Choglamsar on the outskirts of the city was particularly badly hit. In neighbouring valleys, large numbers of smaller villages which lay under the main rainfall band were also heavily damaged, with large numbers of casualties. As in Leh, much of the destruction was caused by debris flows coming from the rocky sidewalls of the valleys, not by the flooding itself. Notable impacts occurred in Sobu, Phyang, Nimu, Nyeh, and Basgo villages. In total, almost 1500 homes in 71 settlements across the area were reported to have been damaged. Detailed mapping and estimation of the entrapped sediment mass within the transverse stream valleys of various sectors of Himalaya is required to predict the style of mass transfer during such events.\\"Sedimentary and Geomorphic Signatures of a Cloud burst and triggered flash floods in the Indus valley of Ladakh Himalaya\\".

All of the estimated 3000 tourists in Leh, including 1000 foreigners were safe according to local officials. Outside the town, six tourists were reported killed. However, official documents indicate that at least 255 local residents were killed, with a further 29 never found. The true toll may have been significantly higher, perhaps more than 600 people. Response The rescue efforts were hampered by gushing water and mud which was 10 feet high in places. In addition many of the roads and bridges leading to Leh were damaged making it difficult to truck in relief supplies. Four hundred critically wounded people were evacuated and some were admitted to the army hospital in Leh. Indian Army soldiers launched a massive rescue operation. Home minister P. Chidambaram said that over 6,000 security personnel were deployed in Leh for rescue operations. Prime minister Manmohan Singh expressed grief and announced compensation of Rs. 100,000 to the kin of deceased and Rs. 50,000 for those injured. Chief Minister of the state Omar Abdullah directed the administration to undertake relief effort on a war footing.

Over the firm's 14-year history, the strategy has evolved from a \\"value strategy with a growth overlay\\" to a \\"valuation-sensitive growth strategy,\\" which selects growth stocks deemed as mispriced relative to their peers and their own price history. The expectation of the strategy is that a catalyst will eventually incite investors to re-evaluate such stocks, thereby causing prices of these equities to rise.[1] Profit in the Media Profit Investment Management has appeared on several financial media sources.

It is a lower-class residential neighborhood, whose borders are formed by the following streets, Calles Hern√°ndez y D√°valos in the north, Viaducto Piedad in the south, Calzada de la Viga in the east and Calzada San Antonio Abad in the west. Description The neighborhood is named after Parque Asturias, a football stadium constructed in the area by the Centro Asturiano de M√©xico, which existed on the corner of Calzada de Chabacano and Jos√© Antonio Torres street. The field was built in 1936 and had a seating capacity of 25,000 spectators, and was the first major football field in the history of the city. The first game held in the stadium was between a Brazilian team (Botafogo) and the Asturianos team. A publicity stunt for the event had the ball for the game dropped onto the field by an airplane. This field no longer exists and has been the site of a supermarket since the 1970s. History The origins of the neighborhood date from 1905, when √ç√±igo Noriega proposed the urbanization of what was then called Colonia La Paz.The plans for the construction of housing subdivisions were approved by the city in 1907, forming streets and blocks, but it did not officially establish the administrative division of colonia. The project then stalled. In 1913, the Agr√≠cola y Colonizadora Mexicana Company proposed a similar project, but this, too, ran into problems. By 1920, there were houses and blocks but only semi- organized, with houses and other properties encroaching on other private properties and colonias. At this time, a large canal still ran through the area. To the side of this canal, the Cuauht√©moc borough decided to build a large road to the side it, which is Calzada de Chabacano. At this time, the La Piedad River on the south border was still open, but today it is encased entirely in a cement tube. Education The neighborhood has three schools. Two are private:Centro de Educacion Especial y Rehabilitacion on Oriente Street and Colegio Americano Monarca on Ramon Fabie Street. There is one public primary school, Escuela de Participacion Social Num 6 on Jose Antonio Torres Street. This school is about 100 years old. While authorities try to conserve the building due to its historic and architectural value, its deteriorated condition has caused problems for school operations. Principal Mar√≠a Virginia P√©rez stated in 2008, that major reconstruction work is needed, but the borough has not provided the needed monies. A number of local families have tried to contribute, but the school serves a mostly underprivileged community. Transportation =Public transportation= The area is served by the Mexico City Metro.

Miles is an author and consultant to CEOs and corporate boards of directors. He is currently the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of The Miles Group, and is a director at CDK Global (NASDAQ: CDK; formerly ADP Dealer Services), where he serves as a member of the Compensation and Nominating & Governance Committees. Previously, he was a Vice Chairman at Heidrick & Struggles where he ran Leadership Advisory Services and was a member of both the Global CEO and Board Practice, and the firm‚Äôs management committee. Background Miles was born in Nairobi and lived a somewhat ‚Äúnomadic‚Äù childhood in places such as South Africa, Iraq, Argentina and Canada. Driven by the study of human psychology, Miles received his Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (1991) from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and a Masters in Psychology from the University of Victoria (1994). After working as a social worker counseling maximum-security inmates at the Kingston Penitentiary in Ontario, Miles turned his focus to management and leadership, receiving his Masters in Business Administration (1999) from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Upon receiving his MBA, Miles worked for about a year as a consultant at Anderson Consulting before he arrived at Heidrick & Struggles in 1999. After arriving at Heidrick & Struggles as a research analyst, Miles moved on to become a vice chairman and run Leadership Advisory Services within the Leadership Consulting Practice, overseeing the firm‚Äôs worldwide executive assessment/succession planning activities. Career Miles' research centers on CEO succession and leadership. Using the 360 degree evaluation process, Miles has helped companies such as BHP Billiton, Nokia, Best Buy, and Adobe assess their internal leadership capacity and develop emerging leaders within each company. Miles was mentioned in a 2018 Business Week article as the executive coach of Snap, Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel, and is credited with helping Snap move from a \\"hub-and spoke\\" to a \\"distributed\\" model of leadership. Miles was featured in Fast Company's 2020 article on the Most Innovative Company of the year, Snap, Inc., in which he recounts his work with CEO Evan Spiegel. Marshall Goldsmith, noted that Miles is ‚Äúnear the top, especially given his age, [and] probably has a broader knowledge base than [Goldsmith].\\" In November 2010, Business Week magazine published a feature article on Miles, calling him the ‚Äúrising star of CEO consulting‚Äù and ‚Äúthe CEO whisperer‚Äù and highlighting the successful work he has done in the area of CEO and executive coaching. Shantanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe Systems has described Miles as ‚Äúwicked smart,‚Äù while Marius Kloppers, CEO of BHP Billiton, has described him as ‚Äúfearless in a soft but determined sense.‚Äù Miles and Stanford University Graduate School of Business Professor David F. Larcker have collaborated on a Stanford Graduate School of Business case study on CEO succession planning, entitled ‚ÄúMultimillionaire Matchmaker.‚Äù In a 2010 research study, they found that 51% of companies could not name a CEO successor today, if needed. Miles and Larcker continued this thread of research in 2011, to examine whether active CEOs make the best board members. They found evidence to suggest that while active CEOs bring prestige to a board, they are often not the best choice because they are commonly too busy with their own businesses to be a fully effective director. Stephen launched ‚ÄúC-Suite Intelligence,‚Äù a podcast for senior executives in 2019. Aimed at helping leaders continuously up their game amidst complex business environments the podcast reveals the secrets of highest performers, and encourages listeners to leverage this intelligence to power their careers. In 2012 Miles was invited back to his alma mater of Queen‚Äôs University to deliver the convocation address to the 2012 graduating MBA class. He used this opportunity to pay homage to a university that was so important in his life, and to share lessons with graduates on the importance of finding the three mentors that will matter during the course of their careers as well as other steps they should take to develop their leadership abilities. Miles‚Äô 2006 book, Riding Shotgun: The Role of the Chief Operating Officer, was featured in the Harvard Business Review as one of the first in- depth studies of the COO‚Äôs role within a corporation and how the role can successfully intersect with that of the CEO. He is a regular contributor to the Management Blog at Bloomberg Businessweek, and is quoted regularly about succession planning and leadership issues in the press.

Halifax explosion The Halifax Explosion occurred on Thursday, December 6, 1917, when the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, was devastated by the huge detonation of the SS Mont-Blanc, a French cargo ship, fully loaded with wartime explosives, which accidentally collided with the Norwegian SS Imo in a part of Halifax Harbour called \\"The Narrows\\". About 2,000 people were killed by debris, fires, or collapsed buildings and it is estimated that over 9,000 people were injured. Ladd treated thousands of individuals injured in the explosion; including hundreds of children who had suffered burns and lacerations as a result of watching the explosion with their faces pressed against windows.Pediatric neuroscience: Volume 13 p. 283 S. Karger, 1986Lorene Newberry. Sheehy's Emergency Nursing p.379 Mosby, 2005. Pediatric surgical career Ladd's experiences in Halifax had a profound effect on him, and after returning to Boston, Ladd devoted himself entirely to the surgical care of infants and children. Ladd became the Surgeon-in-Chief at Boston Children's Hospital in 1927, and went on to establish the first pediatric surgical training program. In 1941, with his associate Robert E. Gross, he co-authored the first modern American pediatric surgical textbook, Abdominal Surgery of Infancy and Childhood. Ladd retired in 1947, and his position at Children's Hospital Boston was assumed by Gross. He is remembered as a pioneer in the field of pediatric surgery. Ladd's band Ladd's bands, sometimes called bands of Ladd is a fibrous stalk of peritoneal tissue that attaches the cecum to the abdominal wall, and creates an obstruction of the duodenum.Browne, Nancy Tkacz. Nursing Care of the Pediatric Surgical Patient. p. 334 Jones & Bartlett Publishers: Boston, 2006 This condition is found in intestinal malrotation. A surgical operation called a Ladd's procedure is performed to alleviate intestinal malrotation. This procedure involves surgical division of Ladd's bands, widening of the small intestine's mesentery, performing an appendectomy and correctional placement of the cecum and colon. Ladd's bands and the Ladd procedure are named after him.

It is a major landmark of Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street and Nikitskiye Vorota Square. It is named \\"greater\\" to prevent confusion with a nearby church of the same name. The church was commissioned by Prince Potemkin, the owner of a neighbouring messuage, shortly before his death. The yellow-colored Neoclassical building was erected between 1798 and 1816. The name of the architect is not known for certain. It has been attributed either to Matvey Kazakov, who built numerous Moscow churches in the reign of Catherine the Great, or Ivan Starov, who frequently worked for Potemkin. The edifice was overhauled to Osip Bove's designs after the 1812 Fire of Moscow. It stood unfinished for several decades and was not completed (under Afanasy Grigoriev's supervision) until 1848. The church holds historical significance for several reasons. It was in this church that Alexander Pushkin married Natalia Goncharova, a fact commemorated by their fountain statues on Nikitskie Vorota Square. It was also there that Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow held his last service;The Moscow Encyclopaedia this is commemorated by a side-chapel dedicated in his name. The church was closed during the Soviet period, between 1931 and 1990. A 17th-century tent-like belfry, the sole remnant of an earlier church on the site, was demolished in 1937 and replaced by a statue of Aleksey Tolstoy, the \\"Red Count\\". The current belfry, freely based on Kazakov's designs and similar in style to the main church building, is of recent construction. There is a chapel of ease on Arbat Square.

These hydrocarbon products are called terpenoids. The plants that produce terpenoids in large enough quantities to be harvested can be as big as trees or as small as single-cell algae. The family Euphorbiaceae has been studied in detail by Dr. Melvin Calvin, Nobel Laureate, and discoverer of the Calvin Cycle. One particular tree of the genus Hevea, more commonly known as the rubber tree, is probably the most famous hydrocarbon plant, supplying an estimated one third of the world‚Äôs rubber demand. It is still not as quick and cheap to make as petroleum-based rubber, which is why it does not occupy a larger portion of the market. Hevea naturally produces a latex substance which can tapped by cutting into the tree, and the latex can then be processed into rubber. Most hydrocarbon plants are not trees, however, so this technique of tapping the tree is no longer feasible. Instead of tapping the tree, the hydrocarbons are extracted using various organic solvents. This process is especially useful with single-cell algae, such as Botryococcus braunii. This algae has two forms, both of which live in brackish water. The first form is a red algae that produces odd-numbered carbon chains roughly 25-31 atoms in length. These carbon chains usually do not possess a large number of double bonds. The second type of B. braunii is green and produces even-numbered carbon chains that are between 34 and 38 carbons long, with many double bonds present. While the cause of this difference is not well-studied, the two different algae can be used for discrete purposes. Dr. Calvin began his studies of hydrocarbon plants in 1977 by looking at yields of Euphorbia lathyris over two years. While his results were limited, due to growing season complications,Calvin, Melvin, Esther K. Nementhy, and John W. Otvos. \\"HYDROCARBONS & ENERGY FROM PLANTS.\\" (1978): n. pag. eScholarship. University of California, 20 June 2011. Web. 16 Apr. 2013. he did find there to be a substantial amount of hydrocarbon products. Once the plant samples were separated using adsorption chromatography and column chromatography, they were analyzed via mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, and gas chromatography, 31-and-34-carbon-long alkane chains were found to be present in the hexane layer of the adsorption chromatography The PETRO project The PETRO project is a program started in 2011 that has tried to address creating petroleum products using plants. The program is made of 10 projects that are all aiming to extract petroleum directly from plants without affecting the U.S. food supply. The goal of the program is to make more oil per acre than what we have now, and with less processing before it gets to the pump. This results in a process that is cleaner, uses less energy, and is more sustainable than the system we have in place presently. The ten PETRO projects include: # Harvesting the sugar from sorghum and processing it into farnesene, which is an additive in diesel fuels. # Designing carbon fixation pathways to produce pyruvic acid. # Manipulating the oil producing plant Camelina so that it is drought and cold resistant, making it possible to grow in harsh environments. # Making photosynthesis more effective by changing chemical pathways. # Turning sugarcane and sorghum into oil-producing crops. # Engineering Camelina so that the topmost leaves reflect light onto the lower part of the plant, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the plant. # Modifying Camelina so that it produces copious terpenes and modified oils. # Engineering tobacco so that it produces fuel molecules in its leaves. # Increasing the turpentine harvest in pine trees. # Developing plants that produce vegetable oil in their leaves and stems as opposed to their seeds. All of these efforts are funded through the ARPA-E program available through the U.S. Department of Energy. The program, headed by Jonathan Burbaum, has received over $37,000,000 dollars of funding since its initial acceptance into the ARPA-E program.

The song that is about the unrest in Indian Kashmir and Human rights abuses in Kashmir and failures by Kashmiri politicians including the separatists. It became an immediate hit in the valley and outside. The song was sung during protests. The studio where the song was recorded was raided by the local police after the song was released and the staff was questioned about involvement of any separatist leader. Kash, who was emotionally disturbed by the deaths of youth, including his friend, in the unrest, wrote the song. According to Kash, he wrote this in English to spread awareness about the situation in Kashmir. Kash faced hard time in recording his songs after this song was released as most of the studios denied facilitating him and he felt considerable pressure to stop raising such issues in his songs after people close to him showed concern about his security.  Background  2010 Kashmir unrest was a series of violent clashes in Jammu and Kashmir between the state and the locals, who took to streets protesting against the killing of three locals in the state. 110 people were killed in protests by the indian forces, during this protest.  Composition  The lyrics to the song are graphic. The song's video begin with news clippings about the protests during the 2010 protest. Kash challenges the Indian occupation in the song by saying, \\"Tales from the dark side of a murderous regime, an endless occupation of our land an' our dreams\\", which is considered sedition according to Indian law, where no one can question India's claim over Kashmir. He also criticizes the local media of not fully covering the human right violations in the region by saying \\"sponsored media who hide this genocide\\". The song ends with the name of those 65 people who lost their lives during the struggle in 2010, up till September.  Influence  The song made Kash a popular among the people of the valley and it became a protest anthem for the Kashmiris who were protesting against the state. Kashmiri youth express their protest against the indian forces, by displaying \\"I Protest\\" banners in blogs, social networking sites, etc. Those who didn't come out of their homes usually also put \\"I Protest\\" as their status on social networking sites. Groups by the name of \\"I Protest\\" were also started on Facebook that was updated with the deeds of Indian security forces against the civilians by posting stories, pictures and videos. Kash influenced many other Kashmiri youngsters to express their feelings through the art of singing. A verse from this song (I Protest, Until My Freedon Has Come) became the title of the book Until My Freedom Has Come, a collection of essays on Kashmir, edited by Sanjay Kak.

After being imprisoned in the Fort Marion in Saint Augustine, Florida in 1875, Howling Wolf became a proficient artist in a style known as Ledger art for the accounting ledger books in which the drawings were done. Sand Creek Massacre Howling Wolf, along with his father Eagle Head (Minimic), were in the Southern Cheyenne camp on Sand Creek in Colorado Territory on the morning of November 29, 1864 when they were attacked by Colonel John Chivington and the First Regiment of Colorado Volunteers. The camp was caught off guard as Black Kettle was instructed to camp there by the U.S. Army and most of the braves were out on a hunt. Howling Wolf, who was only 15 at the time, and Eagle Head, were among the few warriors to defend against the unprovoked attack. The approximate number of deaths amongst the Southern Cheyenne and allied Arapaho (some of which were in Black Kettle's camp) is 137, most were women and children. The Americans committed numerous atrocities at what is known to history as the Sand Creek Massacre, including mutilating the corpses of the dead, such as cutting out the genitalia of a murdered Cheyenne woman and stretching it over the front of a hat.Smiley, B. \\"Sand Creek Massacre\\", Archeology magazine. Archaeological Institute of America. Retrieved February 8, 2010. Prisoner of war In 1875, Howling Wolf and Eagle Head were among a group of 33 Southern Cheyenne, 11 Comanche, 27 Kiowa and one Caddo imprisoned at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. They were then taken by eight prison wagons to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and placed upon a special train to carry them east to imprisonment in the old Spanish fort in St. Augustine, Florida renamed Fort Marion by the U.S. Army, along the way one Cheyenne, Suh-tai attempted suicide but was thwarted in his efforts only to be shot and killed attempting to escape.Cheyennes at Dark Water Creek: the last fight of the Red River War By William Young Chalfant, p. 173 Artwork At the Sand Creek Massacre, 1874-1875 by Howling Wolf While at Fort Marion, Howling Wolf became a proficient artist in what came to be termed Ledger Art, so-called as the drawings were done on paper from accountants ledgers, the most readily available source of paper at the time. The drawings were evocative of traditional Plains hide painting. The artwork was sold to tourists in St. Augustine who visited the fort. Howling Wolf's artwork along with the other ledger artists has risen in monetary value through the years and is valued as an expressive eyewitness account of the experiences of the artists and their tribes. Later life In addition to becoming an artist, Howling Wolf was made a sergeant in charge of the Indian guard at the fort, a unit made up of the Native American prisoners. While he was at Fort Marion he along with other captives under the tutelage and supervision of Captain Richard Henry Pratt received traditional American schooling in diverse subjects such as reading and writing English. Howling Wolf would spend three full years in captivity before he was released in 1878 and returned to Oklahoma to live upon the Cheyenne reservation. He originally intended to stay in the East to continue his education however his failing eyesight, (treatment for which he sailed to Boston for an operation) prompted his return to the reservation. In 1881, Howling Wolf became disillusioned with the habits and customs he had adapted of the white European Americans. He returned to wearing native Cheyenne dress and along with other Cheyenne such as Roman Nose became involved in the Native American Church. Death Howling Wolf died in 1927 in a car accident while on his way home to Oklahoma after performing in a Wild West show in Houston, Texas.SzaboEncyclopedia of the Great Plains By David J.

CB 3 that continued en route to the 1st Naval Battle of Guadalcanal Nov. 1942. In December 1941, Rear Admiral Ben Moreell, Chief of BuDocks, recommended establishing Navy Construction Battalions and on the 28th requested authority to carry this out. On 5 January 1942, he got the go-ahead from the Navy's Bureau of Navigation to recruit construction tradesmen for three Naval Construction Battalions. When those three Battalions were formed the Seabees did not have a base of their own yet. Look So, upon leaving Navy boot, those men were sent to National Youth Administration camps in Illinois, New Jersey, New York or Virginia to receive military training from the Marine Corps.Building the Navy's Bases in World War II, Dept. of the Navy Historical Center, 805 Kidder Breeze SE., Washington Navy Yard, Washington DC 20374, Chapter VI p. 138 The 3rd began arriving at the \\"newly\\" opened Camp Rousseau mid-May 1942 as the first CB at Port Hueneme.Historic California Posts: When the Navy came to Port Hueneme, Dr. Frank A Blazich, Seabee Museum From there the 3rd CB deployed by Company as Seabee detachments do today. An A Company detachment joined the Bobcats of Construction Detachment 1 on Bora Bora, B Company went to Noum√©a, New Caledonia and C & D Companies went to Fiji. A Co sent two officers and 100 men to Bora Bora that were \\"merged\\" into the Bobcats. In the fall of 1943 the Bobcats had completed their work and had received orders to join B Co at Noum√©a. Enroute those orders changed making the Bobcats and A Co. into the 3rd battalion 22nd Marines. At that time the remainder of A Co. (5 officers and 292 enlisted) was transferred to Samoa as well. A comment in the battalion record states: that there wasn't anything good to say about Samoa, but maybe they had been on the wrong island. When the Marines finished they took the Seabees back to Hawaii where the regiment received amphibious warfare training. With that completed the men were tasked as shore party, engineers and demolitions men for the landings in the Marshalls. When those operations were over the Bobcats were released by the Marine Corps with 2 officers and 225 enlistedNCB 3 History, NCB History List, NHHC, Seabee Museum Archives, Port Hueneme, CA returned to CB 3 as A Company. Of them, the two officers and 40 men were from the original A Company, the other men were what was left of the Bobcats. The 22nd Marines took part in the Battle of Eniwetok where the 3rd Battalion was heavily involved in securing the island and would land in the assaults on both Engebi and Parry Islands also. At Kwajalein and Roi Namur 3rd Battalion was the assault reserve. For its actions on Eniwetok the 22nd Marine Regiment received the Navy Unit Commendation.Navy Unit Commendation - Continued (GROUP III), Navy and Marine Corps Awards Manual [Rev. 1953] Part. 2 - Unit Awards, p.25, NHHC website, published: 29 July 2019 B Co On 30 October the USS Enterprise (CV-6) pulled into Noum√©a after taking two hits and two near misses during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and B Co. was tasked to help. The Big E was the only air craft carrier remaining in the Pacific West of Pearl Harbor, but had bomb damage to the flight deck at the bow and just aft of the forward elevator. The 500 pounder that struck there split in two upon penetrating the flight deck. The smaller portion detonated on the hangar deck putting a 30'x60' bulge in the flight deck. Part of the deck was raised four feet. The larger portion passed down to third deck blowing out bulkheads, killing the ships Repair Party Number 2 mustered below.Damage Report: 26 October 1942, Santa Cruz Battle Damage, USS Enterprise CV-6 Association website, 2003 A third bomb was a near miss, midships below the waterline, that broke ship frames 30, 31, and 34. The concussion cracked an after-bearing support on one of the ship's turbines. The jolt caused the fore- mast to rotate in its socket enough to disable all the electronics mounted on it. It also affected the midships elevator. The other 500 lb. miss was starboard below the waterline at elevator number 1. It caused rivet failure, ruptured an oil tank and flooded two more plus the machinery room for an ammunition elevator.Sections F & G, USS Enterprise (CV-6) War History, 7 December 1941 to 15 August 1945, War Damage Report 59, The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal 12-15 NOV. 1942, NHHC, U.S. Hydrographic Office, 1947, p. 17-26 (section G1-1) That forced Damage control to flood additional compartments to restore trim. Upon docking in Noumea the damage assessment Officer off the repair ship USS Vestal told Adm. Halsey repairs would take 3 weeks.Then There was One, The Jersey Brothers, Sally Mott Freeman, Simon and Schuster, 2017, p.184-7 Halsey replied that they could have some Seabees and they had ten days.

On day eleven they all remained aboard when Halsey ordered the Enterprise back to action for what would be the called the Battle of the Solomons. Underway to engage the enemy, the Seabees focused on effecting repairs even into the battle. They had worked round-the-clock under the Enterprise's damage control officer. They even had had Noum√©a harbor lit up during blackout to get the ship operational. The damage control officer wrote that on 11 November: \\"She made the open sea with her decks shaking and echoing to air hammers, with welders' arcs sparking... without watertight integrity...leaking oil...and with her forward elevator still jammed.\\" On 13 November the ship's Captain notified Halsey at SOPAC that \\"The emergency repairs accomplished by this skillful, well-trained, and enthusiastically energetic force have placed this vessel in condition for further action against the enemy\\". Those repairs enabled the Enterprise to take part in the sinking of the Japanese battleship Hiei that day during the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.ACTION REPORT - 13‚Äì15 November 1942, USS ENTERPRISE CV-6 Association website, 2003, p. 1.B.1. In the next few days the Enterprise would be involved in the sinking of another fifteen ships and damaging eight more. While it appeared to everyone that the forward elevator had been repaired the Ok to test it was not given until after the battle. It worked. When it was over Vice Admiral Bull Halsey (Commander SOPAC Noum√©a) knew what those Seabee repairs meant to the battle. He sent a commendatory letter to the OIC of B Company Lt. Quayle: \\"Your commander wishes to express to you and the men of the Construction Battalion serving under you, his appreciation for the services rendered by you in effecting emergency repairs during action against the enemy. The repairs were completed by these men with speed and efficiency. I hereby commend them for their willingness, zeal, and capability.\\" The Enterprise returned to Noum√©a on 16 November for the Seabees to complete the repairs. She departed again on 4 December.

B Co. set up operations on Ile Nou upon arriving in Noumea. It was originally tasked with building a tank farm which was cancelled. War developments led to the components of Cub 1 being delivered to them instead of New Zealand. In addition to building the destroyer base they set up a pontoon assembly facility utilizing the labor of a Company of buffalo soldiers from the 24th Infantry Regiment. They also setup an aviation motor rebuild facility on Ile Nou.Noumea, South Pacific, Building the Navys Bases in WWII, Vol II (Part III), GPO Washington DC, 1947 Over the next two years a number of smaller detachments were sent to islands in both the Samoan and Fijian groups.Seabee Unit Histories In 1944, the battalion was reformed in New Caledonia and departed Noum√©a on 22 May to return to Camp Parks, California where on 12 July it was ordered disbanded and then subsequently decommissioned on 16 August 1944. =Korean Era, MCB 3= An aerial view of Cubi Point The Battalion was re-activated as MCB 3 on 15 July 1950 at Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme, California. In November the battalion's first deployment was top secret on Amchitka, in the Aleutians. The DOD wanted to know the suitability of the island for the nuclear tests of upcoming Project Windstorm. The battalion drilled 34 test holes to learn the hydrology and cratering potential of the geologic strata on the island.Amchitka and the Bomb, Nuclear Testing in Alaska, Dean W.

The first problem encountered was moving the fishing village of Banicain, which occupied a portion of the site for the new airfield. The town and its residents were moved to Olongapo, which became New Banicain. The former village site is now under of earth. The next, and biggest, issue was cutting a mountain in half and moving the material to fill in Subic Bay to create a long runway. CBs 2, 3, 5, 9 & 11 all blasted coral to fill a section of the bay as well as adjoining swampland. They removed trees as large as tall and in diameter from the construction site. It was one of the largest earthmoving projects in the world, equivalent to the building of the Panama Canal. The construction took five years and an estimated 20 million man-hours. The $100 million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956 and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. Adjusted for inflation the cost in today's dollars would be roughly $934,229,168.10.Inflation Calculator, Morgan Friedman website The following four years were spent on Okinawa, Japan constructing Marine Corps Air Facility Futenma. The Battalion's next major construction job was an airstrip at Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, after which MCB 3 served on Okinawa and Guam. =Vietnam War, MCB 3= Ghost Battalion colors at Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. The Seabees had 11,000 graves to move in order to construct that airfield. (USN) MCB 3 bunker at Gia Le 1967-68(Seabee Museum) The Ghost Battalion was commanded by Cmdr. R.L. Foley who was TAD from NMCB 3. He received the Legion of Merit with V for combat for the job he did. (USN) In May 1965 MCB 3 made its first of three visits to Da Nang, Vietnam constructing more than 500 facilities for the Marine Corps. One of the projects was a tough road job to the Monkey Mountain Facility. MCB 3's second and third tours in Vietnam took them to Chu Lai and Gia Le. In 1966 NMCB- 3 received their First Battle \\"E\\", and while in Chu Lai, the Battalion was named Pacific Fleet \\"Best of Type\\" on 11 September 1966 by Rear Admiral W. M. Heaman, Commander Construction Battalions. In the summer of 1967, MCB 3 Deployed to Phu Bai to support projects for the Third Marine Division. This began with improvements to the air facility at MAG (Marine Air Group) 36. Following that was the development of a complete rock quarry, north of Phu Bai. Part of the battalion started construction of Camp Eagle in support of the 101st Airborne, while others built a 5000,000 gallon P.O.L. facility on Tan My island, east of the Imperial City of Hue. During this deployment an urgent airfield was needed at Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. The project was designated \\"top secret\\", site \\"X\\", and to be completed in under 45 days. MCBs 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 74, 121, and 133 all sent detachments of men and equipment to get the job done. Those detachments dubbed themselves the \\"Ghost Battalion\\" and chose the Jolly Roger for the Battalion's colors.Naval History and Heritage Command, U.S. Navy Seabee Museum, The Ghost Battalion MCB 3's commanding officer, Cmdr. R.L Foley was posted TAD as commander of the Ghost Battalion and would receive the Legion of Merit Medal with Combat V for the job he did. At the same time MCB- 3 built up a complete combat base surrounding their own camp. This became Gia Le combat base. It was finished just in time to withstand the 1968 Tet Offensive and the Battle of Hue City. MCB- 8 relieved MCB- 3 in January 1968 and while deployed with the Marines in Gia Le, assisted their adjacent units with all types of construction, along with general engineering support as well as mortar support. This effort earned the \\"Better than Best\\" a Presidential Unit Citation from President Richard Nixon upon their return to the States. In 1968 the Marine Corps requested that the Seabees make a name change from MCB as the Marine Corps was using MCB for Marine Corps Base, so the Navy created the NMCBs. In July 1968, NMCB 3 again deployed to Da Nang, Vietnam. They were first assigned to Camp Faulkner, to the south of the city, near Marble Mountain and next to the NSA (Naval Support Activity) Hospital. The battalion worked on \\"Igloo\\" bunkers at ASP-1 (Ammo Supply Point). NMCB 3 then became the first Seabee battalion to relocate while deployed to Vietnam when they moved north of the city to Camp Haskins South on Red Beach. While stationed at their new camp, NMCB 3 worked on building the NSA Bridge Cargo Ramp east of Da Nang city, to allow the offloading of LSTs. They also replaced the runway and turn-arounds with new matting at the An Hoa Marine combat base, made road improvements on highway 1 in the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass, north of Da Nang and built the \\"Golden Gate Bridge\\" to replace the \\"Liberty Bridge\\", which had been destroyed several times, on \\"Liberty Road\\" between Da Nang and An Hoa. After preparing for a 5th deployment to Vietnam in August 1969, the battalion orders were changed and NMCB 3 was deployed to Camp Kinzer (present day Camp Shields), Okinawa. While at Camp Kinzer, the battalion made numerous improvements to the camp itself, including the construction of a new subsistence building, barracks and roads. NMCB 3 also conducted major excavating projects at Marine Corp Air Station Futenma, which included baseball fields and a stadium. In October 1970, NMCB 3 again deployed to Camp Haskins South, on route one, north of Da Nang for a 5th deployment to Vietnam. =Seabee teams= *0301 Bon Sar Pa, Jul 63 ..The Regimental Insignia of the Special Forces.

Seabee Teams MEDCAP A component of the Civic Action Program was the Medical Civic Action Program or MEDCAP. In 1967 MCB3's medical personal would make visits twice a week to the villages and hamlets around Hue and Phu Bai. The team consisted of a Doctor, Dentist and several corpsmen. =Cold War, NMCB 3= In November 1971 NMCB 3 was deployed to Guam to start construction of a new Seabee camp. The Battalion lived up to its \\"Better Than Best\\" motto by constructing enough permanent facilities to have the dedication of Camp Covington on 4 May 1972. In October 1971, MCB-3 advance party arrived in Guam, equipment operators and builders were detached to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam under direction of Admiral Morrison, COMNAVMAR by the request of the Commander of Andersen Air Force Base; to build 76 B-52 pads in support of the Vietnam War. Working 24/7 mission was completed in six months. The Battalion was deployed to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico early in 1974 to construct barracks and other base improvements. In February 1975 the Battalion deployed to Diego Garcia, a British territory in the Indian Ocean. There, NMCB 3 contributed to the massive NCF construction effort. NMCB 3 was named \\"Best of Type\\" in 1976 and winner of the Peltier Award for providing emergency assistance to all military commands on Guam. The Battalion did so while maintaining it's projects timelines in the aftermath of Super-Typhoon Pamela. From April 1977 to August 1982, the Battalion was divided into two \\"teams\\" (Blue and Gold) which rotated between Port Hueneme and Camp Shields, Okinawa. The Battalion was named \\"Best of Type\\" and awarded the Battle \\"E\\" in 1978, 1980 and 1981. Upon returning to homeport from their third rotation of the \\"Split Concept\\" (January 1980), Blue Team was tasked to nearby NAWC Point Mugu where they assisted in flood disaster recovery efforts. The following homeport of 1981, NMCB 3's Iwakuni Det Blue 4 was assigned to \\"Project Rimstone\\" as the night crew, (subsidizing the 31st NCR), located in Santa Barbara, the Det commuted nightly, from CBC Pt Hueneme, to President Ronald Reagan's ranch. Completing the project on time, the Seabees of this detail received Presidential letters of Commendation, Presented by J.M. Dougherty Commanding Officer of NMCB 3, on 22 October 1982. In March 1983 the reunited Battalion deployed for the first time to Camp Mitchell, Naval Station Rota, Spain where it was again named \\"Best of Type\\" in the Pacific Fleet. In 1986 NMCB 3 deployed to Guadalcanal to aid the clean-up of Typhoon Namu. For this they received the Peltier award along with the Humanitarian service medal. From 1983 to 1989 the Battalion made routine deployments to the European and Pacific Theaters and was named \\"Best of Type\\" in the Pacific Fleet for FY 1987. In October 1989, while completing a homeport field exercise, the Battalion deployed its Air Detachment from Fort Hunter Liggett, California, to the San Francisco Bay area to provide earthquake recovery assistance. The Air Detachment personnel repaired severely damaged utilities at Naval Air Station Alameda and Naval Station Treasure Island. =The 1990s= 130922-N-VN372-102 (9949417156) CE2 Dwayne Watson uses his weapon to clear razor wire during an endurance course 22 September 2013, at the Marine Corps Jungle Warfare Training Center at Camp Gonslaves, Japan. NMCB-3 had a little more than a platoon participate the eight-day training. In January 1990, NMCB 3 returned to Rota. The Air Detachment was dispatched for disaster recovery operations in North Africa where they repaired flood-damaged rail lines, significantly aiding in Tunisia's economic recovery. In March 1991, NMCB 3 deployed to Guam and provided Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with Typhoon Owen disaster recovery assistance in Yap. NMCB 3 also cleared runways and repaired utilities at Naval Air Station Cubi Point in support of Operation Fiery Vigil following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. NMCB 3 returned to Guam in July 1993, sending a Civil Action Team to Palau and a short-term detail to Saipan to help make preparations for the 50th Anniversary of World War II. Five's Seabees repaired facilities, utilities and schools following the worst earthquake to shake Guam in more than a century, measuring 8.2 on the Richter Scale. In September 1994, NMCB 3 embarked upon a 14-country, four-continent deployment. The Battalion supported the United Nations protection force operation \\"Provide Promise\\" by maintaining the U.S. Hospital at Zagreb, Croatia. It also installed surveillance equipment in Baghdad, Iraq. In November 1995, NMCB 3 deployed details to stateside U.S. military installations for the first time. It also ended a chapter in Seabee construction by completing projects on Diego Garcia. In January 1997, the Battalion's main body returned to Camp Mitchell, Rota, Spain. NMCB 3 Bees broke new ground in deploying to two Baltic locations new to Seabees, Estonia and Uzbekistan. There they provided construction support during \\"Operation Baltic Castle and a U.S. Humanitarian Aid Program (HAP) Operation Provide Hope. On 23 April 1998, NMCB 3 participated in the exercise Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT '98). This was a first-time participation for Seabees in a combined fleet and multi-national exercise of this type. In Rayong, Thailand, NMCB 3 completed the construction of a second story addition to the Camillian Social Center. The center provides a place for Aids victims during their last days. The Battalion had the opportunity to show exactly how mobile they are when they received a call to action in 1998. A modified Air Detachment quickly deployed to Nairobi, Kenya, in support of Operation Resolute Response. The detachment assisted in disaster relief efforts, structural repair and the recovery of evidence and classified material following the U.S. embassy bombing. On 15 May 1999, NMCB 3 headed to Rota, Spain where shortly after arriving on station, the Battalion was called into action in support of Joint Task Force, Shining Hope. NMCB 3 repaired roads in Northern Albania that were weakened by the steady flow of more than 800,000 Albanian refugees from Kosovo and years of neglect. Shortly after Detachment Albania left, the mission changed and the Battalion sent an advanced party of 43 personnel into Kosovo. Within two weeks, the battalion integrated Detail Albanian's 150 personnel with an additional 184 Seabees from Camp Mitchell. The mission was to build 64 Davidson style Southeast Asia Huts (SEAhuts) in 90 days for an Army base camp at Camp Monteith, Gnjilane, Kosovo. Maintaining 24-hour operations for nearly two months, THREE stayed on schedule and completed the initial tasking in 89 days. By the time the Battalion departed for homeport in December 1999, they had built more than 80 SEAhuts and constructed more than of hardstand. In December 1999, the Battalion returned home after a successful deployment that once again earned them the \\"Best of Type\\" award for the Pacific Fleet and the right to wear the coveted Battle \\"E\\". They were also awarded the Navy Unit Commendation Medal for their work during the 1999 Pacific Deployment. In July 2000 saw the Battalion sent to Guam on a Pacific Deployment. The Battalion immediately tasked two Detachments for Training: one to the Seychelles to dismantle three ray domes, the other to Indonesia to build a road and repair a schoolhouse. =Post 9-11= SWCN Sanders, of NMCB 3, welds tubular steel for a gate at Kandahar Air Field, Afghanistan, December 2010.

Detachments went to Thurmont, MD; Tidewater, VA; Naples; Sigonella; Souda Bay; the Republic of Georgia; Stuttgart, Germany; and Gabon, Africa. With Camp Mitchell in Force Protection, Condition Delta, NMCB 3 deployed an air-Det there in December 2001. In support of Operation Enduring Freedom they built an Al Qaeda detention facility at Camp X-ray. The Det also constructed 65 SEAhuts for JTF 160 security forces and cleared a site to construct a 160-bed Fleet Hospital. In December 2002, NMCB 3 deployed to Camp Shields Okinawa with dets at 14 sites across the pacific and Southwest Asia. Despite changes in deployment schedules and preparations for Operation Enduring Freedom and with Operation Iraqi Freedom, NMCB 3 met all operational goals. The Okinawa deployment was followed by more support tasking for both \\"Operation Enduring Freedom\\" and \\"Operation Iraqi Freedom II\\". In April 2004 a new Pacific deployment began. The Battalion was made the lead in Task Force Sierra, a construction task force supporting several joint special operations commands. Detachments in support of OEF were in both the CENTCOM AO and the PACOM AO. In all, NMCB 3 had personnel at 36 different locations. The Battalion had two main body sites in Guam and Iraq with 8 primary detachment sites. July 2005 saw the unit returned to Iraq with 9 detachments in country. In addition Three had detachments to the Horn of Africa, Souda Bay, Guantanamo Bay, Andros Island, Bahamas, Rota, Spain, Bahrain, and the Setchelles. NMCB 3 was the only CB to be tasked to provide 6 Convoy Security Teams (CST) while providing over 11,000-man days of construction support to the II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF). NMCB 3'S CSTs safely executed more than 130 successful convoy missions resulting in 17 combat action ribbon awards. In November 2005, NMCB 3 was relieved by 133 in Fallujah, Iraq. The unit redeployed to Kuwait to set up main body operations in support of Combined Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) and Area Support Group, Kuwait. The new main body deployment site was completely undeveloped. Integrating with NMCB 3 were over 145 personnel from NMCB 21 and 139 personnel from the Army's 63rd Construction Support Element. The Seabees worked with the Army to develop a master plan for what would become a CB main body deployment site for almost five years. Prior to returning home in early 2006, NMCB 3 completed over 20,000-man days of tasking on 58 projects for the CFLCC mission. A deployment to the Far East began December 2006. The main body went to Camp Shields, Okinawa, with detachments to Atsugi, Iwakuni, Sasebo, Fuji and Yokosuka, Japan, Camp Pendleton and San Clemente Island, Chinhae, Korea and Diego Garcia. Additionally, a short-fused detail was stood up to support Special Operations Forces for Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. During the deployment, NMCB 3 aided the DOD's civil military operations focus with five civic action training detachments: three in the Philippines and one each in Korea and Thailand. April 2008 saw the Battalion return to Iraq and Afghanistan in support of the First Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF). They assumed control of Task Force Sierra for a second time. The Battalion supported I MEF as they pressed the remnants of Al Qaida and stood up the fledgling Iraq Security Forces to take control of that country's defenses. Task Force Sierra again supported the tip of Security Forces to take control of that country's defenses. Task Force Sierra again supported the American effort to take out or capture Al Qaida and Taliban insurgent leaders. The Battalion racked up 72,000 mandays of construction supporting OIF and OEF while deployed. After an abbreviated homeport, the Battalion became the first Main Body to deploy to Naval Station Rota, Spain since 2005. After relieving NMCB 11 in August they reopened and improved Camp Mitchell and Naval Station Rota infrastructure. Civic action Detachments were sent to Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Serbia to provide humanitarian aid in these Eastern European countries. Another 300 Seabees spread out across Africa drilling waterwells, renovating schools, training host national militaries and worked civic action Liberia, Cameroon, Djibouti, Kenya, Comoros and Uganda. From November 2010 to June 2011 NMCB THREE completed a deployment to Afghanistan where they supported US and Coalition forces spread across more than 30 different locations throughout Afghanistan. Key efforts included the completion of 110 tactical infrastructure projects, ranging from combat outpost builds to route construction, in support of I and II MEF, Special Operations Forces, and Task Force Helmand, a British Led Task Force. THREE's efforts contributed to improved counterinsurgency operations. From Feb-Aug 2012 NMCB THREE completed a deployment to Europe and Africa in support of EUCOM and AFRICOM. The Battalion had dets in 13 countries conducting HCA and ERC construction projects. The task was to sustain and improve international relationships with partner countries. They included: Djibouti, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, Spain, Italy, Croatia, Bosnia, Morocco, Togo, Ghana, and Liberia.

Education and career  Rohwer holds bachelor's degrees with emphases in biology, chemistry, and history from the College of Idaho and earned his doctorate in molecular biology from the San Diego State University/University of California, San Diego Joint Doctoral Program.  Contributions  =Shotgun metagenomics= In 2002, as a research scientist San Diego State University, Rohwer performed the first shotgun metagenome (Breitbart et al. 2002). This method of randomly sequencing DNA from the environment transformed the study of viruses and microbes in the environment and associated with macroorganisms. =Viral diversity= The first shotgun metagenome, also called virome, showed that there were thousands of viral species per liter of seawater (Breitbart et al. 2002; Angly et al. 2006). Working with Anca Segall, Mya Brietbart, Rob Edwards, and the SDSU Biomath Group, Rohwer performed the first virome studies of corals, soils, sediments and humans (Breitbart et al. 2003, 2005, 2008). Based on this work, he proposed that viruses, and particularly bacteriophage, are the most diverse biological entities on Earth. =Phage Proteomic Tree= Virome studies showed that most viral diversity was extreme and almost completely unknown. Rob Edwards and Rohwer proposed that a genome-based taxonomy was need to link the metagenomic data to the existing, morphology-based taxonomy. The controversial Phage Proteomic Tree was the resulting system and was featured in Life in Our Phage World (2015). =Holobionts= Working with Nancy Knowlton at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Rohwer showed that reef-building corals harbored hundreds of thousands of unique bacterial species (Rohwer et al. 2002). They proposed that these bacteria, viruses and other microbes were important for coral health and formed an ecological unit called the holobiont. Further, they hypothesized that changing membership of the holobiont was the primary mechanism of adaption to changing environmental conditions. =Microbialization of coral reefs= In 2005, Rohwer participated in the Northern Line Island expedition headed by Enric Sala and Stuart Sandin. The goal of this research cruise was to determine the effects of human populations on coral reefs. Rohwer performed the first shotgun metagenomes from these islands and proposed that overfishing by humans led to microbialization. Subsequent studies showed microbialization is a global phenomenon and a primary reason for the decline of coral reefs (McDole et al. 2012). This work was featured in Rohwer's book Coral Reef in the Microbial Seas. =Bacteriophage Attachment to Mucus (BAM) Immunity= While studying corals, Kristen Marhaver and Rohwer noted that bacteriophage, viruses that infect bacteria, were four to five times more abundant than the surrounding seawater. Building on this observation, Jeremy Barr and Rohwer (Barr et al. 2013; 2015) showed that bacteriophage bind to mucus through hypervariable protein domains displayed on the capsid. This effectively concentrates the bacteriophage in the mucus, where they kill bacteria and protect the underlying animal tissue. Rohwer has proposed that this Bacteriophage Attachment to Mucus (BAM) Immunity is the first example and origin of the specific immune response. =Piggyback-the-Winner= Microbialized coral reefs have relatively high bacteria abundances and reduced bacteriophage abundances. To explain this observation, Rohwer and colleagues (Knowles et al. 2016) proposed that the temperate life cycle was the predominant bacteriophage life cycle at high host abundances. The resulting bacterial lysogens would be protected from other bacteriophage via superinfection exclusion and protists via expression of virulence factors.  Work  He has authored more than 180 scientific papers and book chapters, as well as two popular science book, Coral Reefs in the Microbial Seas (2010) and Life in Our Phage World (2015). He pioneered the use of metagenomics as a means to characterize viral and microbial communities, such as those associated with coral reefs. His field work with colleagues includes expeditions to the Northern Line Islands in 2005 and 2010, and to the Southern Line Islands in 2009.  Awards  Rohwer has been named a Fellow of both the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). In 2008, he received the Young Investigators Award from the International Society of Microbial Ecology (ISME).  Personal life  Growing up in Idaho, Rohwer learned scuba diving in a frigid glacial lake. Later he took that skill to tropical waters where, for more than twenty years, he has been diving and doing research on coral reefs around the world. He lives in University Heights, San Diego, California, with microbial geneticist Anca Segall, and their daughter Willow.

It was built between 1948-1954, in difficult times for Poland. In June 1950 it became a parish church for a new parish in Niepokalan√≥w. Three-nave church can accommodate up to five thousand people. The height of the church tower is 47 m. Three massive, double winged doors hold symbols of the most famous places of Marian apparitions around the world. In April 1980, Pope John Paul II granted the church the title of the basilica minor.  Plans and construction of the church  The first idea to build a new church in Niepokalan√≥w (or at least a large chapel), appeared before the Second World War. In 1933 the magazine \\"Rycerz Niepokalanej\\" (\\"The Knight of the Immaculate\\") wrote: It is necessary to build a new chapel, or - as some of the readers want - the church, because there is no room to accommodate all of us. Unfortunately, at that time, the Franciscans did not have adequate funds to start the building. Construction plans were prepared and approved in December 1938 in Warsaw. An external company was hired for analysis of the land on which the church was to stand. In May 1939, there was blessed a cross on the square assigned for building the church. The outbreak of war in September 1939, stopped the work for a long time. After the war, in June 1948, the first brick was put for the building of a new church. The design was made by the architect Zygmunt Gawlik. The church, devoted to the BVM the Immaculate, the Omni-mediatress of All Glories, could hold up to 5000 people. It was consecrated on 3 October 1954 by Bishop Wac≈Çaw Majewski, who replaced the imprisoned cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski. Professional co-friars worked at decoration of the interior of the church: sculptors, stonemasons, blacksmiths and so on. Many of the sculptures were made by Artist-Friar Maurycy Kowalewski, with the help of Friar Abel Dzie≈Çy≈Ñski and the other friars. On the church tower there were mounted four clock bells, named: Knight of the Immaculata, Maximilian, Francis and Anthony.  Architecture and specifications  Entering the church, a visitor can see the statue of Our Lady Immaculate in the main altar. This statue is a work of Maurycy Kowalewski and Abel Dzie≈Çy≈Ñski, friars-sculptors from Niepokalan√≥w. In the chapel of St. Joseph (on the right side of the church) there are two important mosaics. The first of them (round mosaic) commemorates the baptism of Poland. The Latin inscription says: Mesco dux baptizatur - Polonia semper fidelis - 966-1966 (Prince Mieszko baptized - Poland is always faithful - 966-1966). The second, huge mosaic (placed on the wall) shows Jesus the Merciful and the Immaculate Heart of Our Lady. Main altar and the statue of BVM The chapel on the left side is dedicated to St. Maximilian Kolbe. A marble statue of the saint, placed in the central part of the chapel, offers the entire globe to the Mother of God. On the chapel walls there are hung many votive offerings, in thanksgiving for the graces received. A round mosaic, located next to them, presents a speech of St. Maximilian to the co-prisoners in the Auschwitz camp. Near, in the central part of the church there is situated a Carrara marble ambo. Bas-reliefs of the Holy Trinity, Christ teaching in the boat and the Evangelists, can attract the attention of visitors in the nave. The specifications of the basilica are: \\\\- the length from the beginning of the stairs to the end of the apse - 84,8 m. \\\\- the length of the interior of the basilica - 69 m. \\\\- the height of the main nave - 16 m. \\\\- the width of the church - 18 m. (the width with both side chapels - 33 m.) \\\\- the height of the tower clock - 47 m.  Pope John Paul II and other pilgrims  Since the time of the beatifications of Fr. Maximilian Kolbe (1971), many important guests visited Niepokalan√≥w and the local basilica. There were bishops, cardinals and high rank politic officials among them. Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, Primate of Poland, who visited Niepokalan√≥w several times, said once: \\"Before the war Niepokalan√≥w grew far and wide. After the war the hard times came, and then the Franciscans, unable to keep up their common job, did the wisest thing they could - they built a church.\\" On 18 June 1983, during the 2nd Pastoral Visit in Poland, Pope John Paul II visited the basilica and the monastery in Niepokalan√≥w. In the basilica he met the representatives of religious orders to which he gave a speech. Then, during the Holy Mass at the field altar he preached a sermon to over 300,000 people. The visit of the pope increased the number of pilgrims coming to Niepokalan√≥w. Many people wanted to visit the place, sacred by activity of St. Maximilian, and to pray in the local basilica.

Life  Leonard was born in Union City, Michigan and educated at Michigan State and the University of Michigan before going west in 1888. After brief periods in San Diego and Los Angeles, he settled in San Francisco. From 1889 he was employed there doing iron and steel engineering for various firms, including the Southern Pacific Railroad. Leonard opened his own consulting civil engineering office in 1904. Even in the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, resistance to fireproof reinforced concrete was strong. Leonard's analyses of concrete's superior performance in the earthquake and fire, especially Ernest L. Ransome's two buildings at Stanford University, and a constant stream of his articles and editorials in Architect and Engineer of California, changed the city's ordinances and gained national attention. As of 1913 Leonard was in partnership with William Peyton Day. Together they produced the pamphlet The Concrete Bridge, showing examples and analyses of Leonard's work. In 1916 Day left to form the noted San Francisco firm of Weeks & Day. Leonard would engineer about 20 buildings in post-1906 San Francisco, become increasing involved in building inspection, and ultimately design about 45 bridges in California.

Osgood, The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century, vol. III:145f. Both Samuel Pepys and William Berkeley, Governor of Virginia, railed at times against Povey's incompetencePepys found him a \\"wretched accountant\\". and maladministration. Life The son of Justinian Povey of London, he was educated at Gray's Inn. He was a cousin of Thomas Povey, Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, and of Sir John Povey, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. Povey became Member of Parliament for Liskeard in 1646, Bossiney in 1659 and held under Oliver Cromwell a high post in the Office of Plantations. Following the Restoration he was appointed in July 1660 Treasurer to the king's brother James, Duke of York, but the Duke's affairs falling into confusion, Povey was relieved of his office, 27 July 1668, for a consideration of ¬£2000.\\"Thomas Povey\\", The Diary of Samuel Pepys, 1893 text He was First Treasurer to the Lords Commissioner for Tangier, a lucrative post in which he was followed by the conscientious Samuel Pepys, organiser of the English navy. Povey made an agreement with Pepys in 1665, touching the profits expected from that office by 17th-century convention. Years later, in 1691, Povey brought suit against Pepys and William Hewer at the Court of Chancery with reference to a breach of the agreement; it seems to have been settled out of court.Eleanore Boswell, \\"Footnotes to Seventeenth-Century Biographies. Samuel Pepys\\" The Modern Language Review 26.2 (April 1931:176‚Äì178). Povey family interests in the English Caribbean were extensive: Thomas's brother Richard Povey looked after the family interests in Jamaica, where he was officially Commissioner General for Provisions, while another brother, William, attended to affairs in Barbados, where he was officially Provost- General.Bernard Bailyn, \\"Communications and trade: the Atlantic in the seventeenth century\\", Journal of Economic History, 1953. Povey was one of the original members of the Royal Society in May 1663 and had acted in the interests of its less formalised predecessor at Gresham College. Povey proposed Samuel Pepys for membership, 8 February 1665.Norman J.W. Thrower, \\"Samuel Pepys FRS (1633‚Äì1703) and the Royal Society\\" Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 57.1 (January 2003:3‚Äì13) p. 6. John Evelyn, a fellow member of the Royal Society, found Povey \\"a nice contriver of all elegancies and exceedingly formal\\". As a Fellow, Povey offered the Royal Society a dissertation in 1693 on the manufacture of brass.Povey, \\"The Method, Manner and Order of the Transmutation of Copper into Brass, etc. by Thomas Povey, Esq; Brought into the Royal Society, of Which He is a Fellow\\", Philosophical Transactions (1683‚Äì1775), Vol. 17, (1693:735‚Äì736). Povey presented a report on Louis XIV's H√¥tel des Invalides,C.I. Ritchie, \\"The hostel of the Invalides by Thomas Povey (1682)(Lambeth Palace Library MS. 745)\\", Medical History, 1966. which Charles II emulated in the Royal Hospital Chelsea, under a Royal Warrant of 22 December 1681. Povey had apartments in Whitehall Palace by virtue of his Crown posts. Robert Streater painted a ceiling in Povey's London house, on the west side of Lincoln's Inn Fields; there John Evelyn visited him in July 1664: > Went to see Mr Povey's elegant house in Lincolns-Inn-Fields , where the > perspective in his court, painted by Streater, is indeed excellent, with the > vases painted in imitation of porphy and fountains...Evelyn, Journal, 1 July > 1664.

Povey also inherited from his father Hounslow Priory, situated in a suburban village west of London; it was sold in 1671, and by the end of the 18th century only the chapel remained.Daniel Lysons, 'Heston', The Environs of London: volume 3: County of Middlesex (1795:22‚Äì45): accessed 6 August 2010. He donated to the Royal Society the portrait that he asserted was of the historian George Buchanan and by Titian.William Carruthers, \\"On the so-called portrait of George Buchanan by Titian\\", The Scottish Historical Review 6.24 (July 1909:337‚Äì342). In his court appointment as Master of Requests, 1675‚Äì85, he received petitions and presented them for consideration by the Privy Council. Povey advanced the early career of his nephew William Blathwayt, and it is surely due to his influence that his son- in-law Giles Bland was sent to Virginia as customs collector.Bland soon got into trouble with Governor Berkeley and in Bacon's Rebellion served as Bacon's lieutenant in the attack upon Berkeley at Accomack (Wilcomb E. Washburn, \\"Sir William Berkeley's 'A History of Our Miseries'\\" The William and Mary Quarterly, Third Series, 14.3 [July 1957:403‚Äì413]). Some of the paintings from Povey's collection, which hung in his London house or at Hounslow, remain in Blathwayt's house, Dyrham Park, Gloucestershire. Povey's letter books are conserved in the British Library.B.L. Add. Mss 11411. Family He married Mary, daughter of John Adderly and widow of John Agard of King's Bromley, Staffordshire. His daughter Sarah married another member of the Staffordshire gentry, Robert Leveson of Wolverhampton and had three sons, including the soldier and politician Richard Leveson. Another daughter Sarah married Giles Bland, who was executed for treason in Virginia in 1677, having played a leading part in Bacon's Rebellion the previous year.

The White Mountain Wilderness is located in the Sierra Blanca mountains of south central New Mexico, approximately north northwest of the town of Ruidoso. History The White Mountain Wilderness was established as a primitive area by the United States Congress in 1933 and was included in the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1964. The area originally consisted of approximately . In 1980, additional land was added to bring the overall total to over . Geography and climate This wilderness area contains approximately of land and is long and wide. It consists of mainly a long, northerly running ridge and its branches. The west side of this ridge is extremely steep and rugged, while the eastern side is more gentle with broader, forested canyons and some small streams. Elevations range from at Three Rivers Campground on the western side to near Lookout Mountain in the south. The summit of Sierra Blanca (White Mountain) is located on the Mescalero Indian Reservation and is reached by a 1.25 mile (2 km) trail from Lookout Mountain. Reaching , Sierra Blanca is the southernmost mountain in the continental United States to rise above timberline.Parent, Laurence, The Hiker's Guide to New Mexico. Helena, MT: Falcon Press, 1993, p. 162 There are four different life zones within this wilderness area: pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, and sub-alpine forest, plus alpine tundra found at the summit of Sierra Blanca just outside the wilderness boundary. Abrupt changes in elevation, escarpments, rock outcroppings, and avalanche chutes make for striking contrast and scenery. The area is also interspersed with meadows and grass-oak savannahs, which are the result of forest fires. The weather is dry and windy in springtime, with temperatures ranging from 32 ¬∞F/0 ¬∞C to 80 ¬∞F/26 ¬∞C. July and August are the rainy months with frequent afternoon showers and high temperatures averaging 85 ¬∞F/29 ¬∞C. Snows in winter do not typically begin until mid-November, and snowfall averages or more. Low temperatures during winter average around , but have reached as low as . Water sources are not abundant, but do exist in the form of small streams or springs scattered throughout the area. Trails with good water access include Big Bonito Trail and South Fork Trail. Although fishing is permitted within the wilderness area, few fish are found due to the small size of most streams. Although the streams run well most of the year, in times of severe drought, they may be non-existent. Wildlife and trails Wildlife includes mule deer, elk, black bear, turkey, porcupine, badger, bobcat, gray fox, coyote, skunk, spruce and rock squirrels, and numerous species of mice, moles, and birds. Feral hogs are also becoming abundant in this region. Hunting is permitted according to state game regulations. Additionally, as in all national forests, concealed carry of firearms for personal protection is permitted, provided the person has a concealed handgun license recognized by the state of New Mexico. The area contains a well maintained and developed trail system with more than fifty miles of trails and nine miles (14 km) of access trails. Most trails are well marked and follow ridgelines or canyon bottoms. These trails are easily negotiated by novice to advanced hikers and backpackers as well as horse riders. Park regulations prohibit the use of motorized vehicles and mountain bikes on trails. Major access points to the wilderness include: * Three Rivers Campground on the west side via Three Rivers Trail #44 * Ski Apache ski area on the southeast side via Lookout Trail #78 and Scenic Trail #15 * South Fork Campground via South Fork Trail #19 * Argentina Canyon via Big Bonito Trail #36 * Nogal Canyon via Forest Service Road 108 * Crest Trailhead below Monjeau Lookout off Forest Road 117 File:White Mountain Wilderness sign.jpgWilderness sign File:Camping Wilderness.JPGCampers in White Mountain Wilderness File:Nogal Peak.JPGView of Nogal Peak in the White Mountain Wilderness References External links * Lincoln National Forest, National Forest Service website Category:Protected areas of Lincoln County, New Mexico Category:Protected areas established in 1933 Category:Wilderness Areas of New Mexico Category:Lincoln National Forest ","title":"White Mountain Wilderness"},{"id":"28281816","text":"Walther Schroth (3 June 1882 ‚Äì 6 October 1944) was a general in the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany during World War II.

Royal American Shows out of Tampa Florida was one of the largest traveling carnivals and used 1928 to 1931 Scouts. This carnival attraction became a staple in the United States outdoor entertainment industry with the phenomenon reaching its zenith in the 1930s, with more than 100 motordromes on traveling shows and in amusement parks. The audience views from the top of the drum, looking down. The riders start at the bottom of the drum, in the centre, and ascend an initial ramped section until they gain enough speed to drive horizontally to the floor, usually in a counter-clockwise direction (the physical explanation behind this act is found at Banked turn and The turning car.) In the United States the American Motor Drome Company uses several vintage Indian Scout Motorcycles from the 20s to give the audience a view of how these shows were done in their heyday. The American Motor Drome Company is the only wall of death to have two riders Inducted into the Sturgis Motorcycle Hall of Fame Jay Lightnin' (2014) and Samantha Morgan (2006). In 2015 the Indian Motorcycle company chose the American Motor Drome Company to preview the new 2015 Indian Scout to the world by putting it on their wall along with the 1926 and 1927 Indians that were regularly used in their show. The newest wall of death show in the United States is the 'Wild Wheels Thrill Arena' which will be performing in the Traditional Style of the Carnival Midway Shows.

These acts feature original American Indian motorcycles which have been in use since the 1920s. A similar act called the \\"Globe of Death\\" has the riders looping inside a wire mesh sphere rather than a drum. This form of motorcycle entertainment had a separate and distinct evolution from carnival motordromes and derived from bicycle acts or \\"cycle whirls\\" in the early 1900s.

It was developed by Herman Zanstra in 1927. It is assumed that the nebula is optically thick in the Lyman continuum, which means that all ionizing photons from the central star are absorbed inside the nebula. Based on this assumption, the intensity ratio of a stellar reference frequency to a nebular line such as HŒ≤ can be used to determine the central star's effective temperature. NGC 7293, The Helix Nebula, a planetary nebula Credit: NASA, ESA, and C.R. O'Dell (Vanderbilt University) Zanstra method for a nebula of hydrogen For a pure hydrogen nebula, the ionization equilibrium states that the number per unit time of ionizing photons from the central star has to be balanced by the rate of recombinations of protons and electrons to neutral hydrogen inside the Str√∂mgren sphere of the nebula. Ionizations can only be caused by photons having at least the frequency u_0, corresponding to the ionization potential of hydrogen which is 13.6eV: \\\\int_{ u_0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{L_ u}{h u} d u = \\\\int_0^{r_1} n_p n_e \\\\alpha_B dV Here, r_1 is the radius of the Str√∂mgren sphere and n_p, n_e are the number densities of protons and electrons, respectively. The luminosity of the central star is denoted by L_ u and \\\\alpha_B is the recombination coefficient to the excited levels of hydrogen. The ratio between the number of photons emitted by the nebula in the HŒ≤ line and the number of ionizing photons from the central star can then be estimated: \\\\frac{L_{ u_{H\\\\beta}}}{\\\\int_{ u_0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{L_ u}{h u} d u} \\\\approx h u_{H\\\\beta} \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{H\\\\beta}^\\\\text{eff}}{\\\\alpha_B} where \\\\alpha_{H\\\\beta}^\\\\text{eff} is the effective recombination coefficient for HŒ≤. Given a stellar reference frequency u_s, the Zanstra ratio is defined by Z = \\\\frac{L_{ u_s}}{\\\\int_{ u_0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{L_ u}{h u} d u} = h u_{H\\\\beta} \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{H\\\\beta}^\\\\text{eff}}{\\\\alpha_B} \\\\frac{F_{ u_s}}{F_{H\\\\beta}} with F_{ u_s} and F_{H\\\\beta} being the fluxes in the stellar reference frequency and in HŒ≤, respectively. Using the second formula, the Zanstra ratio can be determined by observations. On the other hand, applying model stellar atmospheres, theoretical Zanstra ratios may be computed in dependence of the central star's effective temperature which may be fixed by comparison with the observed value of the Zanstra ratio.

SL 140 was one of the SL convoys from the South Atlantic to Britain, and MKS 31 was one of the MKS convoys between Britain and the Mediterranean. They were sailing together on the Gibraltar homeward route, having made a rendezvous off Gibraltar in late November 1943. They were the subject of a U-boat attack, as part of the Kriegsmarines renewed Autumn offensive. Background Following the renewal of the U-boat offensive in the Atlantic, convoys on the UK/Gibraltar routes had again come under attack, leading to clashes over Convoy SL 138/MKS 28 and Convoy SL 139/MKS 30. German U-boat Control (BdU) had subsequently re-organized its patrol lines off the coast of Portugal, so as to find and attack the next convoys on this route. As before, the Admiralty were running these in tandem, bringing together the South Atlantic and the Mediterranean routes at Gibraltar. Protagonists SL 140 left Freetown on 12 November 1943, arriving off Gibraltar on 24 November. It comprised 35 ships and was escorted by an Escort Group of four warships. MKS 31 sailed from Port Said on 13 November, similarly arriving off Gibraltar on 24 November to meet SL 140. The combined body of 65 ships then sailed for Britain. It was escorted by B-1 Escort Group, of seven warships, led by , (Commander EC Bayldon). Opposing this force was wolf pack Weddigen, consisting of thirteen U-boats, comprising boats already on station from the disbanded Schill group, with reinforcements from the North Atlantic and from bases in occupied France. Action The two convoys made their rendezvous at noon on 24 November 1943, a total of 65 ships initially escorted by the B-1 Escort Group, of seven warships. The combined convoys were sighted by German aircraft in the late afternoon of 26 November, west of Cape St Vincent, but were able to evade the shadow with a radical course change during the night. The convoy was reinforced by the destroyer Watchman, also on the 26th. On 27 November the convoys were found again by aircraft, which brought in . She commenced shadowing until other Weddigen boats could be homed-in. Also during the 27th the convoy was joined by 4 EG, a Support Group of five frigates led by (Cdr EH Chavasse). By evening the U-boats had gathered and started their assault. Franke, in U-262 was able to penetrate the escort screen into the convoy itself, he attacked the ships there from close range, a tactic used by aces Kretschmer and Schepke two to three years earlier. However his boldness was not rewarded by any success; he fired at, and claimed hits on, three ships, but no hits were confirmed. The three other boats that penetrated the screen, , , and , also failed to make any hits. During the night the convoy was again reinforced by the arrival of 2 EG, a Support Group led by Captain F.J. \\"Johnnie\\" Walker, Britain's most successful anti-submarine warfare commander, in . This brought the total number of escorts for the convoy to seventeen warships. On 28 November U-238 picked up two allied airmen whose aircraft had crashed. U-238‚Äôs skipper, Horst Hepp, radioed a long account of his interrogation of them, which was intercepted and tracked by HF/DF (radio direction finding). Hepp was meanwhile ordered to meet U-764, which was returning to base, in order to transfer the prisoners. Allied forces were sent to intercept the two U-boats, with a view to rescuing the airmen, and prevent the two boats from getting away. Both U-764 and U-238 were attacked the following day by aircraft from the escort carrier ; both were damaged, but both were able to escape. Also on 28 November, 2 EG located and subjected her to a prolonged attack, but she also was able to escape. But by now outnumbered by the convoy escort, Weddigen had little chance of achieving any success; BdU ordered a halt to the attack. SL 140 and MKS 31 continued their passage without further incident, arriving at Liverpool on 26 November 1943. Aftermath Despite the energy of the attack on SL 140/MKS 31 no ships were sunk, nor U-boats destroyed. The escort had successfully beaten off every attack, although the failure to destroy any of the attacking U-boats, despite the presence of two Support Groups, was disappointing to the Allies. Franke, of U-262 received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for this and previous actions on this patrol; significantly the citation commented on the toughness and tenacity shown as the reason for the award, rather than for any major success, as in previous years.

Biography Dan Kiesel is a Jew of German origin and is also a citizen of Germany. He was trained as a physiotherapist at the Assaf Harofe Hospital in Israel from 1956 to 1960. He served for three years in the Israeli Defense Forces, after which he proceeded to England to work at the Epsom Hospital and the Farnham Royal Rehabilitation Centre near Windsor. He moved to Frankfurt, Germany in 1967 to study medicine while continuing to work as a physiotherapist. He earned his degree in osteopathy from the London College of Osteopathic Medicine. Physiotherapy career While studying acupuncture in Sri Lanka, Kiesel treated Australian fast-bowler Dennis Lillee, who recommended Kiesel to the Sri Lankan cricket board. Kiesel served as the physiotherapist for the Sri Lanka national cricket team from 1993 to 1995. After falling out with the Sri Lankan cricket board, Keisel accepted a job offer from the Pakistan Cricket Board. He was appointed physiotherapist for the Pakistan cricket team, in which capacity he served until 1999. His appointment brought some controversy; Pakistani politicians unsuccessfully objected to the hiring an Israeli Jew in the Senate of Pakistan. Kiesel deposed before the Justice Qayyum Commission regarding allegations of match fixing surrounding Pakistan's defeat to India in the second quarter-final of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in Bengaluru. Questioned about the injury of Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, which resulted in Akram pulling out of the match on the day of the match, Kiesel confirmed that Akram was injured and had been treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. However, Kiesel said that Akram himself had to decide about his fitness to play in the match. According to Kiesel, Akram had been confident of playing on the day before the match. He resigned in December 1998 citing personal reasons, but also differences with the then- coach Javed Miandad, whom he claimed was interfering with his work. However, Kiesel continued to work with the team throughout the 1999 Cricket World Cup. During the time he lived in Lahore with his wife Kiesel claimed that he never hid his Israeli identity and despite raising some fundamentalist eyebrows, never encountered any problems.Dan Kiesel: Our man in Pakistan, Haaretz After his tenure with Pakistan, Kiesel continued to work as a physiotherapist and trainer for the cricket teams of Israel and U.A.E.. From 2004 to 2010, Kiesel worked chiefly with the Canadian cricket team.
