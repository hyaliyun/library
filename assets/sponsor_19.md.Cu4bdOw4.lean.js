He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 1979 and died in 1987. University of Michigan A native of Mayfield Heights, Ohio, Coode enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1969 and played college football as an offensive tackle for Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1970 to 1973. As a junior, he started every game at left tackle for the 1972 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10-1 record and was ranked No. 6 in the final AP Poll. As a senior, he started nine games at right tackle for the undefeated 1973 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10‚Äì0‚Äì1 record and was ranked No. 6 in the final AP Poll. Professional football Coode began his professional football career in 1974 with the Detroit Wheels of the World Football League (WFL).

After leaving the WFL, Coode joined the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) at the end of September 1974. played professional football for seven seasons in the Canadian Football League (CFL) as an offensive lineman for the Ottawa Rough Riders. He was a part of the Rough Riders' Grey Cup victory in 1976. He won the CFL's Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman Award in 1978 and the Tom Pate Memorial Award for community service in 1980. His jersey (#60) has been retired by the Rough Riders, and re-retired by the REDBLACKS. Coode was diagnosed with ALS in 1979 and appeared in four games for the Rough Riders in 1980 after the diagnosis. Family and later years Coode was married to Lisa Coode, and they had a son, Jamie. Coode continued to live in Ottawa after retiring from football. A tribute dinner for Coode in May 1983 drew 1,200 persons. Bo Schembechler spoke at the tribute.

This letter's former position in the alphabet was between letters Daviyani and Zaviyani.Bodufenvahuge Sidi. Divehi Akuru; Evvana Bai. Mal√© 1958. Pages 4‚Äì13. Naviyani stands for the retroflex \\"n\\" sound () common to most Indic languages (Sinhala, Gujarati, Hindi, Urdu, etc.). Letter Naviyani was abolished from official documents around 1953 by Muhammad Amin, the ruler of Maldives at that time. The reason why amongst all letters representing retroflex sounds, like Lhaviyani (ﬁÖ), Daviyani (ﬁë) or Taviyani (ﬁì), this particular letter was abolished is not known. The corresponding sound (phoneme ) is still pronounced in the Maldivian language. Nouns like \\"onu\\" (bamboo) or verbs like \\"bunung\\" (to say) have this phoneme. It sounds especially clearly in the speech of southern Maldivians. This letter is still seen in writing in reprints of traditional old books, written before the 1950s, like the Bodu Tartheebu, an ancient religious book. It is also used by Addu people when writing songs or poetry in their language variant. In 2000, when the TƒÅna script was put into Unicode, certain Maldivian government officials didn't see the need to include this letter. Now, however, there is a minor movement for the reinstating of this letter, especially among Addu intellectuals, whose goal is to bring letter Naviyani (ﬁ±) back into currency. Avoiding confusion This letter does not appear on Thaana tables printed after the 1950s and should not be confused with letter Gnaviyani or Nyaviyani, the 16th consonant of the present-day Maldivian alphabet, after which an administrative atoll was named.

Description  The weedy scorpionfish has a highly compressed body, can reach a maximum length of 23 cm, and can vary considerably in color as well as appendages depending on its environment. Specimens found in rocky, algae rich waters are covered in weed-like appendages, whereas specimens found in deeper soft-bottomed waters with soft corals and sponges have fewer appendages. Color can range vastly from dark red and purple to yellow and lavender. The variations differ so vastly that the specimens are often misidentified as between this species and two related species, Rhinopias aphanes and Rhinopias eschmeyeri. Indeed, some have argued Rhinopias eschmeyeri is a morphological variant of Rhinopias frondosa rather than a separate species. However, a 2006 study by Motomura and JohnsonMotomura, Hitoyuki and Johnson, Jeffrey W., Validity of the Poorly Known Scorpionfish, Rhinopias eschmeyeri, with Redescriptions of R. frondosa and R aphanes, Copeia, V. 2006, No. 3 (September 15, 2006), pp. 500-515. confirmed R. eschmeyeri's existence and distinguished it from other members of the genus Rhinopias. Distribution 250px The weedy scorpionfish lives in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean, from Japan to Australia and from South Africa to the Caroline Islands. They are found in depths ranging from 13 to 90 meters. Feeding and behaviour Like most Scorpaenidae, weedy scorpionfish are mostly nocturnal ambush hunters, using their camouflage to prey on unsuspecting fish and invertebrates. They rarely swim, but rather move along the bottom propelling themselves with their fins.Aquarium Fish In aquarium The weedy scorpionfish has no commercial value for fisheries, but commands a high price in the aquarium trade. Although they can be found in the U.S. and Europe, they are mostly exported to Japan where they fetch a very high price. Rhinopias are highly sought after by aquarists who collect rare and unusual species. For comparison, a specimen of the related species Rhinopias eschmeyeri.

The hydrocarbons these species produce can be chemically converted into fuels. Transesterification cannot be used to make biodiesel from botryococcenes, the major oil of Botryococcus braunii. This is because Botryococcene oil is not a 'vegetable oil' (which is a fatty acid triglyceride) but is instead a triterpene, and lacks the free oxygen for transesterification. It can be used as feedstock for hydrocracking in an oil refinery to produce octane (gasoline, a.k.a. petrol), and kerosene. Up to 86% of its dry weight can be long-chain hydrocarbons. Challenges There are several challenges which must be met in order to economically produce the desired alkanes such as gasoline. This will only be briefly covered in this article at this time, as it has only just begun. =Suitable strain= First, a suitable strain of Bb (Botryococcus braunii) must be found. Several strains are available from algae specimen banks, but there is no guarantee that these are high-producing strains. Some plant patent applications have been filed and patents granted, for high producing strains. It is not likely within reason for even a small scale producer of boytrococcenes to breed successively higher producing strains of Bb, due to the reasonably slow generation rate. However, in selecting Bb strains for high Botryococcene production, it is likely that other beneficial attributes may be bred out. For instance, resistance to disease, competitive advantages against other organisms, and survivability in less than ideal climates. In this case, a photobioreactor may be needed. Botryococcus Braunii are relatively cosmopolitan so this is not a major factor. The practice of farming algae is known as algaculture. However, there are properties of Botryococcus braunii which make its harvest a bit different from the harvest of other algae. Compared to other green algae species it has a relatively thick cell wall that is accumulated from previous cellular divisions; making extraction of cytoplasmic components rather difficult. Fortunately, much of the useful hydrocarbon oil is outside of the cell. This gives rise to the hope that the algae will not have to be killed in order to extract its useful oil. Several methods are available to extract the botryococcene. One that shows the most promise is the use of hexane as a solvent. If used at the proper molarity, it does not kill the majority of the Bb, while extracting the botryococcene.

The brief existence of the Kingdom was almost continuously troubled by warfare with the Second Bulgarian Empire; eventually, it was conquered by the Despotate of Epirus. * The County of Salona (1205‚Äì1410), centred at Salona (modern Amfissa), like Bodonitsa, was formed as a vassal state of the Kingdom of Thessalonica, and later came under the influence of Achaea. It came under Catalan and later Navarrese rule in the 14th century, before being sold to the Knights Hospitaller in 1403. It was finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1410. * The Marquisate of Bodonitsa (1204‚Äì1414), like Salona, was originally created as a vassal state of the Kingdom of Thessalonica, but later came under the influence of Achaea. In 1335, the Venetian Giorgi family took control, and ruled until the Ottoman conquest in 1414. * The Principality of Achaea (1205‚Äì1432), encompassing the Morea or Peloponnese peninsula. It quickly emerged as the strongest state, and prospered even after the demise of the Latin Empire. Its main rival was the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea, which eventually succeeded in conquering the Principality. It also exercised suzerainty over the Lordship of Argos and Nauplia (1205‚Äì1388). * The Duchy of Athens (1205‚Äì1458), with its two capitals Thebes and Athens, and encompassing Attica, Boeotia, and parts of southern Thessaly. In 1311, the Duchy was conquered by the Catalan Company, and in 1388, it passed into the hands of the Florentine Acciaiuoli family, which kept it until the Ottoman conquest in 1456. * The Duchy of Naxos or of the Archipelago (1207‚Äì1579), founded by the Sanudo family, it encompassed most of the Cyclades. In 1383, it passed under the control of the Crispo family. The Duchy became an Ottoman vassal in 1537, and was finally annexed to the Ottoman Empire in 1579. * The Triarchy of Negroponte (1205‚Äì1470), encompassing the island of Negroponte (Euboea), originally a vassal of Thessalonica, then of Achaea. It was fragmented into three baronies (terzi or \\"triarchies\\") run each by two barons (the sestieri). This fragmentation enabled Venice to gain influence acting as mediators. By 1390 Venice had established direct control of the entire island, which remained in Venetian hands until 1470, when it was captured by the Ottomans. =Minor Crusader principalities= * The County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos (1185‚Äì1479). It encompassed the Ionian Islands of Cephalonia, Zakynthos, Ithaca, and, from around 1300, also Lefkas (Santa Maura). Created as a vassal to the Kingdom of Sicily, it was ruled by the Orsini family from 1195 to 1335, and after a short interlude of Anjou rule the county passed to the Tocco family in 1357. The county was split between Venice and the Ottomans in 1479. * Rhodes became the headquarters of the military monastic order of the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John in 1310, and the Knights retained control of the island (and neighbouring islands of the Dodecanese island group) until ousted by the Ottomans in 1522. =Genoese colonies= Genoese attempts to occupy Corfu and Crete in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade were thwarted by the Venetians. It was only during the 14th century, exploiting the terminal decline of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty, and often in agreement with the weakened Byzantine rulers, that various Genoese nobles established domains in the northeastern Aegean: * The Gattilusi family established a number of fiefs, under nominal Byzantine suzerainty, over the island of Lesbos (1355‚Äì1462) and later also the islands of Lemnos, Thasos (1414‚Äì1462) and Samothrace (1355‚Äì1457), as well as the Thracian town of Ainos (1376‚Äì1456). * The Lordship of Chios with the port of Phocaea. In 1304‚Äì1330 under the Zaccaria family, and, after a Byzantine interlude, from 1346 and until the Ottoman conquest in 1566 under the Maona di Chio e di Focea company. =Venetian colonies= The Republic of Venice accumulated several possessions in Greece, which formed part of its Stato da M√†r. Some of them survived until the fall of the Republic itself in 1797: * Crete, also known as Candia, (1211‚Äì1669),Maltezou, Crete during the Period of Venetian Rule, p. 105 one of the Republic's most important overseas possessions, despite frequent revolts by the Greek population, it was retained until captured by the Ottomans in the Cretan War.Maltezou, Crete during the Period of Venetian Rule, p. 157 * Corfu (1207‚Äì1214 and 1386‚Äì1797), was captured by Venice from its Genoese ruler shortly after the Fourth Crusade. The island was soon retaken by the Despotate of Epirus, but captured in 1258 by the Kingdom of Sicily. The island remained under Angevin rule until 1386, when Venice reimposed its control, which would last until the end of the Republic itself. * Lefkas (1684‚Äì1797), originally part of the Palatine county and the Orsini-ruled Despotate of Epirus, it came under Ottoman rule in 1479, and was conquered by the Venetians in 1684, during the Morean War. * Zakynthos (1479‚Äì1797), originally part of the Palatine county and the Orsini-ruled Despotate of Epirus, it fell to Venice in 1479 * Cephalonia and Ithaca (1500‚Äì1797), originally part of the Palatine county and the Orsini-ruled Despotate of Epirus, they came under Ottoman rule in 1479, and were conquered by the Venetians in December 1500. * Tinos and Mykonos, bequeathed to Venice in 1390. * various coastal fortresses in the Peloponnese and mainland Greece: ** Modon (Methoni) and Coron (Koroni), occupied in 1207, confirmed by the Treaty of Sapienza, and held until taken by the Ottomans in August 1500. ** Nauplia (Italian Napoli di Romania), acquired through the purchase of the lordship of Argos and Nauplia in 1388, held until captured by the Ottomans in 1540. ** Argos, acquired through the purchase of the lordship of Argos and Nauplia but seized by the Despotate of the Morea and not handed over to Venice until June 1394, held until captured by the Ottomans in 1462. ** Athens, acquired in 1394 from the heirs of Nerio I Acciaioli, but lost to the latter's bastard son Antonio in 1402‚Äì03, a fact recognized by the Republic in a treaty in 1405. ** Parga, port town on the coast of Epirus, acquired in 1401. It was governed as a dependency of Corfu, and remained so even after the end of the Venetian Republic in 1797, finally being ceded by the British to Ali Pasha in 1819. ** Lepanto (Naupaktos), port in Aetolia, briefly seized by a Venetian captain in 1390, in 1394 its inhabitants offered to hand it over to Venice, but were rebuffed. Finally sold to Venice in 1407 by its Albanian ruler, Paul Spata, lost to the Ottomans in 1540. ** Patras, held in 1408‚Äì13 and 1417‚Äì19 in lease, for 1,000 ducats per year, from the Latin Archbishop of Patras, who thus hoped to thwart a Turkish or Byzantine takeover of the city. ** The Northern Sporades (Skiathos, Skopelos, and Alonissos), were Byzantine possessions that came under Venetian rule after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. They were captured by the Ottomans under Hayreddin Barbarossa in 1538. ** Monemvasia (Malvasia), a Byzantine outpost left unconquered by the Ottomans in 1460, it accepted Venetian rule, until captured by the Ottomans in 1540. ** Vonitsa on the coast of Epirus, captured in 1684 and held as a mainland exclave of the Ionian Islands until the end of the Republic. ** Preveza on the coast of Epirus, occupied during the Morean War (1684‚Äì99), recaptured in 1717 and held as a mainland exclave of the Ionian Islands until the end of the Republic. * The whole of the Peloponnese or Morea peninsula was conquered during the Morean War in the 1680s and became a colony as the \\"Kingdom of the Morea\\", but it was lost again to the Ottomans in 1715.

Two of the cemeteries were destroyed by the Soviet regime and the third is still active. The oldest and the largest Jewish cemetery was established in the 15th century in ≈†nipi≈°kƒós suburb, now in ≈Ωirm≈´nai elderate, across the Neris River from the Gediminas Tower. In Vilna Jewish culture, the cemetery was known as Piramont. It was closed by the Tsarist authorities in 1831. It was destroyed by the Soviet authorities in 1949‚Äì50 during the construction of ≈Ωalgiris Stadium. The Vilnius Palace of Concerts and Sports (Lithuanian: Koncert≈≥ ir sporto r≈´mai) was built in 1971 right in the middle of the former cemetery. In 2005, apartment and office buildings were built at the site. The project was condemned by international Jewish organizations and resulted in a motion being passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008, condemning Lithuania for its \\"failure to protect the historic Jewish cemetery in Vilnius.\\" In August 2009, the Lithuanian government reached an agreement with Jewish organizations on the boundaries of the cemetery and granted it protected status. Buildings already on the site will not be demolished. The second cemetery was located in U≈æupis. It was active from 1828 to 1943 or 1948. It was also destroyed by the Soviet authorities in the 1960s following the destruction of the Great Synagogue of Vilna. Tombstones from the two old cemeteries were used for staircases in various construction works around the city.

He was a member of the Country Party and served in the House of Representatives from 1958 to 1972. He was a long-serving government minister as Minister for Territories (1963‚Äì1968) and External Territories (1968‚Äì1972), holding office under five prime ministers.  Early life  Born in Einasleigh, Queensland to wealthy grazier and racehorse breeder JHS Barnes and his wife Sarah, Barnes was raised at farms near Hughenden and Warwick, Queensland.Hansard, House of Representatives, 10 November 1998. Accessed 10 January 2008. Educated in Sydney, Barnes left school at 17 to work for the Union Trustee Company. A cousin of Sir Michael Bruxner, a founder of the Country Party and its long-time leader in the New South Wales parliament, Barnes was also involved in the Country Party from a young age.Whitington, D. (1964) The Rulers. Lansdowne Press, Melbourne. Barnes formed a gold mining syndicate in 1939, re-opening two old mines, the Louisa and British Lion, on the abandoned Palmer Goldfield of North Queensland. Results were disappointing, and wartime fuel rationing closed the operation in 1941.Bell, P. (1987) Gold, Iron and Steam: the Industrial Archaeology of the Palmer Goldfield. James Cook University, Townsville, pp. 34‚Äì35. Barnes enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force on 9 November 1942, serving in Australia and New Guinea and reaching the rank of Flying Officer before his discharge on 13 September 1944.\\"World War II Nominal Roll\\", Commonwealth of Australia, 2002. http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=R&VeteranId;=1039929 Accessed 11 January 2008. Following World War II, Barnes purchased Canning Downs station from his father and developed it into a successful thoroughbred horse breeding operation. Barnes also became heavily involved in the local community, serving as a committee member of the Queensland Turf Club and president of the Warwick Show and Rodeo Society. Barnes found success on the racetrack, with one horse, Basha Felika, winning the 1951 Caulfield Cup and another, Tails, finishing third in the 1971 Melbourne Cup, and considered the second best galloper in the country, after Tulloch. During his parliamentary career, Barnes would credit his horses's success for his popularity with constituents.Royal Agricultural Society of Queensland, Equine Hall of Fame Accessed 10 January 2008.  Politics  With the imminent retirement at the 1958 election of former Prime Minister Arthur Fadden as the member for McPherson, the Country Party sought Barnes as Fadden's replacement for the safe Country seat. Apparently hesitant at first, Barnes had to be cajoled to stand and left his campaign launch early, leaving Fadden to make his own way home. Barnes was comfortably elected at the 1958 and 1961 elections and was appointed the Minister for External Territories (later renamed Minister for Territories) in the Menzies ministry in 1963. He was a member of Cabinet in the first Holt Ministry from January to December 1966. At the time, External Territories was one of the most powerful ministries as it had responsibility for Papua New Guinea, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. In this role, Barnes helped shepherd Papua New Guinea towards independence and worked on Indigenous Australian issues. By 1964 Barnes was considered the most likely successor to Country Party leader John McEwen, whose retirement from politics was thought to be imminent. As it was, McEwen continued as Country Party leader until 1971, including serving as Prime Minister of Australia following the death of Harold Holt.  Later life  Barnes retired from parliament at the 1972 election and returned to managing Canning Downs, where he lived until his death in 1998, aged 96, survived by his wife Barbara, two daughters and one son.

Much of Belgrand's work remains in use today. Civil engineering Prior to 1850, the water system in Paris was inadequate for its growing population. Waste water was discharged into the Seine, a primary source of the critically limited supply of drinking water. Baron Haussmann, tasked by Napol√©on III to modernize the city, appointed Belgrand as Director of Water and Sewers of Paris in March 1855. Hausmann had been impressed by the √âcole Polytechnique graduate's application of geology to water engineering during the design of a fountain in Avallon and he became an engineer from the Ponts et Chauss√©es School and integrated the Yonne technical services in Avallon in 1849. He studied the ancient languages. Belgrand embarked on an ambitious project. The tunnels he designed were intended to be clean, easily accessible, and substantially larger than the previous Parisian underground. Eug√®ne Belgrand took part in the renovation of Paris under the leadership of Haussman between 1852 and 1870: he created an innovating network of underground pipes to prevent Paris from being flooded. Under his guidance, Paris's sewer system expanded fourfold between 1852 and 1869. He also addressed the city's fresh water needs, constructing a system of aqueducts that nearly doubled the amount of water available per person per day and quadrupled the number of homes with running water. Belgrand remains famous for his works, consisting the Paris sewers, the aqueduct on the Vanne river between Arcueil and Cachan, the aqueduct on the Dhuis and a dam of Montsouris which stored the water. Public reaction to the improvements was overwhelmingly favourable, supported by tours of the newly constructed sewer system and a series of photographs taken by Nadar, pioneering the use of artificial lighting for photography. Belgrand shared his insights with others, writing \\"monumental publications\\" detailing his work and the science behind it. Belgrand's projects remain \\"one of the most extensive urban sewer systems in the world\\" and served as a \\"transitional phase\\" leading to modern wastewater processing. Belgrand wrote the history of Paris. Commemoration To commemorate his work in Parisian civil engineering, Belgrand's name is one of 72 names engraved on the Eiffel Tower, opposite the √âcole Militaire. The main gallery of the Paris Sewer Museum is also named in his honor, as is a street in Paris. Now his name is a school's name in the small town of Ervy-le-Ch√¢tel.

Jane Randolph was featured in a supporting role. The Falcon's Brother, the only one to feature two Falcons, was directed by Stanley Logan. Plot Sleuth Gay Lawrence (George Sanders), known as \\"The Falcon,\\" with his assistant, \\"Lefty\\" (Don Barclay), arrive at dockside to meet a Latin American cruise ship. On board is Lawrence's brother, Tom (Tom Conway) who is pronounced dead, a victim of suicide, by homicide inspector Timothy Donovan (Cliff Clark). Diane Medford (Gwili Andre), Tom's shipboard companion offers sympathy, but Lawrence has Lefty tail her, as he already knew the body in the cabin was not his brother. Tracking Diane to a fashion show at the salon of her employer Madame Arlette (Charlotte Wynters), Diane is greeted by her fianc√©, fashion editor Paul Harrington (James Newill). Two other ship passengers, Latin American dancers Carmela (Amanda Varela) and Valdez (George J. Lewis) are there. Reporter Marcia Brooks (Jane Randolph) recognizes the Falcon, who follows Diane into her office. A shot rings out and Diane falls dead. The Falcon runs into the alley behind the salon and encounters his brother, Tom. Inspector Donovan arrives at the scene and arrests Lefty while the Falcon is run down by a speeding car. Tom takes his unconscious brother to his apartment, where Marcia seeks information about the murder. Lefty is released with a suspended sentence, and learns that his boss will soon recover. Marcia informs Tom that the murder weapon is missing, prompting Tom to return to Arlette's salon to investigate. Seeing Arlette at a nightclub, Tom informs her that the police have the gun from the murder scene and are tracing its serial number. Arlette phones the Police Inspector and gives them Tom's whereabouts. Tom and Lefty search Arlette's, where they find the missing gun hidden in a mannequin. Donovan tracks them down at the salon, and when Tom introduces himself, the inspector arrests him for false impersonation, believing Tom Lawrence is dead. After proving his identity, Tom is freed and directs Marcia to investigate Harrington's photographer, Savitski (Andre Charlot). Tom confronts Arlette with the gun, forcing her to admit that she hid the weapon to protect her love, Harrington who denies murdering Diane and is exonerated by a ballistics expert. Marcia discovers that Savitski is an illegal alien. After smoking a cigar, and about to reveal a clue about mass murders to Tom and Lefty, Savitski falls dead, dropping a pile of magazines. Deducing that Savitski was killed by a poisoned cigar, the same way the suicide victim on the ship, was killed, Tom instructs Lefty to pose as the photographer when Valdez and Carmela enter his office with guns drawn. When Tom steps out of the shadows, the pair identify themselves as Mexican counter- espionage agents and explain that Diane was killed because she knew too much. After Tom notifies Donovan of Savitski's murder, he brings back the photographer's magazines. Certain that Harrington is involved in the murders, Tom and Lefty realize a magazine cover dated December 7, prophesying the Pearl Harbor attack and another magazine cover indicates an incident will take place that day at a New England inn. Tom and Marcia speed off to stop the sabotage, while The Falcon regains consciousness and joins Lefty on a trip to New England where German agents have been preparing for an attack, and Harrington is one of them. After capturing Tom and Marcia and locking them in a bell tower, the agents go ahead with their plan to assassinate a Latin American envoy as his aircraft lands. Tom manages to ring the bell, just as his brother steps in front of the diplomat, sacrificing his own life for that of an ally. With the spy ring smashed, Tom takes up where his brother left off, becoming the new Falcon.

Although he was being replaced by his elder brother, Tom Conway, Sanders who wanted out of the series, insisted that his character be killed off in The Falcon's Brother. RKO had wanted to have Sanders star in one more Falcon film with the enticement that having his brother take over the lead role would further his career.

Retrieved: September 4, 2016. p. 176 Reception In his review of The Falcon's Brother, Bosley Crowther wrote, in The New York Times, \\"... in this final encounter of the gay detective with the criminally inclined, Mr. Sanders only opens the snooping and then is conveniently retired while his true (as well as fictional) brother, Tom Conway, takes over the pursuit. And then, in the end, Mr. Sanders is unconditionally killed‚Äîkilled in heroic line of duty‚Äîwhile Mr. Conway is left to carry on. Thus one Falcon passes, but another is providentially fledged. It is too bad that as much ingenuity as was used to effect this interfraternal switch was not put into the further contrivance of a plot. As it is, \\"The Falcon's Brother\\" is just a moderately confusing mystery tale, boasting but three casual murders and the final disposition of Mr. S. Nazi spies, it turns out, are the villains, and that's pretty routine these days. And, ungraciously perhaps, it must be stated that Mr. Conway is only fair as a hero. His voice is like Mr. Sanders's, but his manners are not quite so suave.\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"Movie review: At the Rialto.\\" The New York Times, October 3, 1942.'The Falcon's Brother earned a profit of $128,000.Jewell 2016, p. 11.

This short highway was an important connector link during the construction of Highway 401. The road's main purpose was to link Highway 401 in London with Highway 2 in Lambeth, at a time when the London-area section of Highway 401 was only completed to the interchange with Highway 4 (Colonel Talbot Road). Highway 135 was designated in 1957, alongside the newly opened section of Highway 401 between London and Woodstock. It remained in place as the freeway network grew around it. With the completion of Highway 402 to Sarnia in 1982, Highway 135 no longer served as a long-distance route. As a result, it was decommissioned in 1995, and is now known as Exeter Road.  Route description  Highway 135 was a short route that travelled along today's Exeter Road on the south side of London. At its western terminus, the highway began at an intersection with Highway 2 and Highway 4 (Wharncliffe Road) near Lambeth. From there the route travelled east towards Wellington Road, passing White Oaks Road midway. At Wellington Road, the route turned south to meet Highway 401 at Exit 186\\\\.  History  The road was first designated as Highway 135 in 1957, and was just 6.6 kilometers in length. While Highway 401 continued west of Highway 135's interchange to Highway 4, it was suited for drivers that wished to head towards Windsor along the less-popular Highway 3, as Highway 2 was still the main trans-provincial highway at the time, and was quite busy. The usefulness of Highway 135 as a shortcut to Windsor had dwindled dramatically in 1964, when Highway 401 was completed from Tilbury to Highway 4 as a grade-separated Super two Freeway, finally linking Windsor to London and Toronto. This rendered travelling along Highway 2 to be obsolete, as Highway 401 was straight, did not have stoplights and towns to slow down travellers (though it did bypass several small towns just a few kilometers away, such as Ridgetown and Glencoe). The road was still a provincially significant highway, despite its short length, as it allowed motorists headed to and from Sarnia to travel to Highway 401, by using Highway 135, to Highways 4/2 (multiplexed in London for a while), then Highway 81, to Highway 7 to Sarnia, as Highway 402 was only completed in the Sarnia area. During the 1970s, Highway 402 would be extended in stages towards Strathroy and London. When Highway 402 was completed in 1983, Highway 135's significance was greatly reduced. The road was little more than a shortcut to Highway 4 and the western end of London by the end of the 1980s, and it was formally decommissioned in 1995 by the Ministry of Transportation, thus ending its career as a provincial Kings Highway. Today, the road is simply known as Exeter Road.

Based on the Charles M. Hudson map of 1997 Cofitachequi was a paramount chiefdom founded about 1300 AD and encountered by the Hernando de Soto expedition in South Carolina in April 1540. Cofitachequi was later visited by Juan Pardo during his two expeditions (1566‚Äì1568) and by Henry Woodward in 1670. Cofitachequi ceased to exist as a political entity prior to 1701. The town and ceremonial center of Cofitachequi was located near the present-day city of Camden, South Carolina. Cofitachequi ruled a large number of towns in an area of several thousand square miles in the northeastern part of South Carolina. It was the easternmost extension of the Mississippian culture that extended over much of the southern part of the future United States. Location The hunt for the location of Cofitachequi has been primarily stimulated by the century-old search for the route of Hernando de Soto in his 4-year traverse of much of the southeastern United States. The Spaniards described Cofitachequi as about 10 days travel eastward from Ocute through an uninhabited wilderness. Cofitachequi was situated on a large river about 100 miles from the coast. Several other towns were nearby, including Talimeco, said to be about 3 miles distant and situated on a bluff overlooking \\"the gorge of the river.\\" The description of Talimeco indicates that Cofitachequi was near the Atlantic Seaboard fall line where Atlantic coast rivers drop sharply from the hilly piedmont area to the flatlands extending inland form the coast. Another town, called Ilapi or Ilasi, was located on a second river to the east. Cofitachequi was a large town in addition to being a ceremonial center. The size of Cofitachequi is indicated by the fact that de Soto during his occupation took over about one-half the houses in the town to house his 600 men (and, in addition, to house probably several hundred Indian retainers and slaves). Thus, archaeological ruins of Cofitachequi should, therefore, be extensive.DePratter, Chester B. \\"Cofitachqui: Ethnohistorical and Archaeological Evidence\\" University of South Carolina Scholar Commons, pp. 138‚Äì139; http://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1122&context;=sciaa_staffpub, accessed 14 Oct 2013 The archaeological site which most closely corresponds to the description of Cofitachequi is believed, by most scholars, to be the Mulberry Site at the junction of Pine Tree Creek and the Wateree River, about two miles south of present-day Camden and just below the fall line.DePratter, pp. 143‚Äì144 The Mulberry site consists of three surviving mounds in an area of more than eight acres (3.5 ha). The Mulberry site is one of eight surviving mound centers along an 18 mile (30 km) stretch of the Wateree River both north and south of Camden. This was the heartland of the chiefdom of Cofitachequi.DePratter, Chester B. and Amer, Christopher, \\"Underwater Archaeology at the Mulberry Site\\" Nov 1988, http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/sciaa/mrd/documents/Mulberry_Site%20(38KE12).pdf , accessed 30 Oct 2013 First contacts Cofitachequi may have come to the attention of the Spanish as early as 1521 when two Spanish ships explored the South Carolina coast. At present day Winyah Bay, near the city of Georgetown, they captured and enslaved about sixty Indians who said they were subjects of a ruler called Datha or Duhare. Datha may have been the ruler of Cofitachequi, some 90 miles inland from Georgetown. One of the captives, called Francisco Chicora, learned Spanish and visited Spain. He described Datha to Peter Martyr as \\"white\\", tall, carried on the shoulders of his subjects, and ruling a large area of towns featuring earthen mounds upon which religious ceremonies were held. Large quantities of pearls and jewels, Chicora said, could be found at Xapira, a town or chiefdom near Datha.Hudson, Charles Knights of Spani, Warriors of the Sun Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1997, pp 33‚Äì35 Inspired by these stories, Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n led 600 people to establish a colony that would exploit the supposed riches of Datha. At Winyah Bay, one of his ships was wrecked and Chicora and other Indians escaped from the Spanish. Ayllon established a settlement near Sapelo Sound in present day Georgia, but he died and the colony was abandoned after three months, the 150 survivors returning to the Caribbean.Hudson, pp. 36‚Äì37 Ayll√≥n's colony was probably the source of items of European manufacture later discovered by De Soto in Cofitachequi.DePratter, pp. 134‚Äì135 De Soto and the \\"Lady of Cofitachequi\\" While de Soto was among the Apalachee Indians in Florida, a captured boy called Perico told him of a province named \\"Yupaha\\" ruled by a woman and rich in gold. De Soto decided to strike out for Yupaha‚Äîwhich turned out to be an alternative name of Cofitachequi. In the Spring of 1540, de Soto and his army traveled north through central Georgia to the Oconee River town of Cofaqui in present day Greene County, Georgia, in the chiefdom of Ocute. The people of Calfaqui were aware of Cofitachequi but did not know its exact location. De Soto impressed 700 Indians from Colfaqui and struck off eastward into a large uninhabited wilderness separating the chiefdoms of Ocute and Cofitachequi. He reached Coafitachequi only after two weeks of hard travel and near starvation.Hudson, pp. 165‚Äì171 De Soto was met by a woman the chroniclers call the Lady of Cofitachequi who was carried from the town to the river's edge on a litter that was covered with a delicate white cloth. They considered her the \\"chieftainness\\" of the villages. After spending several weeks in the village, the Spaniards took the \\"Lady\\" as a captive and hostage and headed to the next chiefdom to the northwest, Joara. She eventually escaped. The Spaniards found no gold in Cofitachequi, nor anywhere in its vicinity. Later expeditions Juan Pardo with a force of 125 Spaniards visited Cofitachequi (which he also called Canosi) on two expeditions between 1566 and 1568. Juan de Torres led 10 Spanish soldiers and 60 Indian allies to Cofitachequi on two expeditions in 1627‚Äì1628. He was \\"well entertained by the chief who is highly respected by the rest of the chiefs, who all obey him and acknowledge vassalage to him.\\" In 1670, an Englishman, Henry Woodward, journeyed inland from Charlestown, South Carolina to Cofitachequi. He called the chief \\"the emperor\\" and said the town counted 1,000 bowmen. The \\"emperor\\" of Cofitachequi visited Charleston in 1670 and 1672. Sometime after that, Cofitachequi was abandoned. By 1701, when John Lawson passed through, the area of Cofitachequi was inhabited only by small settlements of Congaree Indians.DePratter, pp. 133‚Äì138 Description Cofitachequi was typical of several Mississippian paramount chiefdoms in the American south at the time of de Soto: a town at the center of the chiefdom, often containing ceremonial mounds and temples and controlling a large number of smaller settlements with the influence of the center extending out many miles. The chiefdoms were often bordered by a uninhabited area as a buffer zone between warring chiefdoms. The basis of the economy was maize agriculture. Cofitachequi was perhaps the easternmost of the Mississippian chiefdoms and one of the latest, founded after 1300 A.D.Hudson, Charles The Juan Pardo Expeditions Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1990, pp. 68‚Äì73 There were three levels of political power at Cofitachequi. The orata was a lesser noble, seemingly in charge a village or a few villages. The mico was a great noble who occupied one of the administrative centers of the chiefdom, presumably complete with a mound. Above these was the gran cacique, the great chief or paramount chief. Lesser officials were ynihas, or ynanaes, who were chiefs' assistants, perhaps comparable to magistrates. The yatikas were interpreters and spokesmen. The culture of Cofitachequi was a variant of the Lamar culture that was broadly comparable to the people of Ocute in Georgia. The people of Cofitachequi are believed by most scholars to have spoken a Muskogean language; if correct, the chiefdom of Cofitachequi was the easternmost extent of this language family. However, the area of influence of Cofitachequi probably also included Siouan (Catawba) and Iroquoian (Cherokee) speakers. Although Cofitachequi's fame was widespread, its area of political control and influence is uncertain. Most likely, Cofitachequi politically controlled a cluster of towns around present-day Camden, an 80 to 100 mile (130‚Äì160 km) stretch of the Wateree River and vicinity in South Carolina, and a similar portion of the Pee Dee River. More distant towns in the piedmont of North Carolina and the coastal plains of South Carolina may have paid tribute to Cofitachequi, but retained a measure of freedom. The scholar Charles Hudson listed more than 30 towns that might have been under the control of Cofitachequi, indicating a population of the chiefdom of several tens of thousands of people.Hudson, The Juan Pardo Expeditions, pp 68‚Äì70, 75, 83 The chiefdom of Cofitachequi may have been in decline when visited by de Soto in 1540 and Pardo in 1566, much of the decline occasioned by the brutal passage of de Soto and his army. De Soto found little maize in the town to feed his soldiers and saw evidence that an epidemic, possibly European in origin, had wiped out the population of several settlements. Nevertheless, the fame and some of the influence of Cofitachequi endured another 100 years until the time of Woodward's visit. Why Cofitachequi disappeared, replaced by smaller communities of Indians, is unknown although the ravages of European diseases was probably a factor. The Muskogean speaking inhabitants of Cofitachequi were probably absorbed by the Siouan people who were inhabiting the area in 1701 when Lawson visited.Pratter, p 133 NotesReferences * Hudson, Charles M., Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun: Hernando De Soto and the South's Ancient Chiefdoms, University of Georgia Press, 1997. * Patricia Galloway, editor, The Hernando de Soto Expedition, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1997.

He founded The Peoples Church in Toronto in 1928. Smith attended the Toronto Bible Training School, the Manitoba Presbyterian College in Winnipeg, and the McCormick Seminary in Chicago. Smith was ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Canada in 1918.Kevin Kee, Marketing the Gospel: Music in English-Canadian Protestant Revivalism, 1884-1957, in R.J.

However, he resigned from the Presbyterian Church, set up his own church in Toronto, which merged with a small Christian and Missionary Alliance congregation in 1921. In 1928, he started another independent church in Toronto, the Peoples Church. Using his base in Toronto for fundraising, he traveled the world to recruit missionaries. Over the course of eighty years he preached more than 12,000 sermons in 80 countries, wrote thirty-five books (with translations into 128 languages), as well as 1,200 poems, of which 100 have been set to music,Richard J.

Paul B. Smith was the son of Oswald J. Smith, and Senior Pastor of The Peoples Church from 1959‚Äì1994. Early years Smith was born on November 8, 1889 near Odessa, Ontario, as the eldest of the ten children of Benjamin and Alice Smith. His early years were troubled by ill health and a delicate constitution. He was once out of school for two whole years after a bout of pneumonia. He said, \\"It was generally accepted that I hadn't many more days on this earth.\\" In spite of dire predictions, he did survive frightening illnesses and grew into a young manhood. On January 28, 1906, during a Torrey Crusade in Toronto, Smith committed his life to the Lord and from that time, his burning desire to preach the gospel became the focus of his life. Smith said, \\"I know as sure as I'm alive, I must preach the gospel. There's nothing else in the world for me.\\" Because of his early dedication to spreading the gospel, Smith offered himself several times for missionary service but his frail health prevented his acceptance. Deeply disappointed, he set about gaining more training and experience.Oswald J. Smith Hall of Mission. Toronto: The Peoples Church. Print. In 1908 he visited the lumber camps, the scattered settlements and Indian villages in the far interior of British Columbia (B.C.) and served as home missionary in other frontier areas of Canada. The hardships he encountered gave him a deep compassion for missionaries and this appreciation showed in his lifelong understanding of their difficulties. During the summer of 1913 he ministered as a home missionary in Cawood, Kentucky where \\"God saw fit to give him many souls.\\" It was during that time of service, far from home, that he wrote his \\"three fold dedication:\\" # I will think no thought, speak no word, and do no deed unworthy of a follower of Jesus Christ. # I will give my life for service in any part of the world and in any capacity God wills that I should labour. # I shall endeavour to do God's will from moment to moment as He reveals it to me. He prepared for further ministry by study. In 1912 he graduated from Toronto Bible college and in 1915 from McCormick Seminary in Chicago. As part of his ordination service by the Chicago Presbytery, Smith's song \\"Deeper and Deeper (hymn)\\" was sung. Missionary vision Smith, who was considered too frail to be a missionary made a commitment: \\"If I can't go myself, I will send someone else.\\" Since no opportunity opened for foreign service, Smith began to see that he could evangelize others who might go in his stead. He was gaining confidence as a speaker; he had spoken at numerous youth meetings and during his Chicago years had served effectively as student pastor in two different Presbyterian churches. as assistant pastor at Rev. Morrow's Dale Presbyterian church, he prayed and believed for revival. It was at this time that he wrote \\"A Revival Hymn\\" that has remained popular during the years. Even in those early years the evangelization of the world was the supreme challenge of his life. \\"Missionary work does not belong to any one organization, it is the work of the whole church,\\" he maintained. Oswald J. Smith and Daisy Billings were married on September 12, 1916 at Dale Presbyterian Church where she was a deaconess and he the assistant pastor. Daisy was considered the gracious and generous helpmate who made possible Smith's dedicated life. She was the one who \\"held the ropes,\\" \\"tarried by the stuff,\\" sublimating her career to his. In later years, when their children were grown, she often joined Smith on his travels until her death in 1972. Smith said \\"intercessory prayer is not only the highest form of Christian service, but also the hardest kind of work.\\" He believed in having a regular time and place for prayer and paced as he prayed to prevent distractions. Every decision of his life was guided by prayer. More than anything he wanted to be used of God. He prayed, \\"Lord, use me...\\" \\"What must I do?\\" He prayed to be a victorious, Spirit-filled man of prayer, a surrendered man of the word, and of one purpose. From the Bible, Smith found the qualifications which he lists in his book \\"The Man God Uses.\\" Prayer was a major component. In the book Smith says, \\"Prevailing prayer, prayer of travail such as Jesus knew, will lead to God being glorified in your ministry.\\" Church planting Besides his work in Toronto, Vancouver, and a year as Superintendent of the Alliance Church in Canada, Smith left for Los Angeles in 1927 as minister of the Gospel Tabernacle, another Alliance church. In 1928 he felt strongly that his call was to Toronto and the family drove back the 3000 miles in a new Nash car. Smith explained: \\"I knew I wasn't in the right place...I wanted to serve God, and serve Him in the place He would have me. It's that simple.\\" Several buildings and locations followed as his vision of an interdenominational church dedicated to missions and worship developed. In 1933, Smith named the work \\"The Peoples Church\\" and in 1934 the congregation moved to 100 Bloor Street East where they remained until the move to Sheppard Avenue in 1962 where the work continued. Smith's travels and ministries multiplied. During his life he made 21 world tours promoting evangelism and world missions. One of the results of his visit to the Baltic countries was the establishment of a Bible School in Riga for the express purpose of training local missionaries. Their success in evangelizing their own people proved to him their value. While leading his expanding congregation in a program supporting over 500 workers worldwide, Smith was instrumental in challenging others to follow his example. Champion of the Faith Smith considered training and education for the ministry essential. He himself read and was influenced by many prominent Protestants: Wesley, Luther, Spurgeon, Moody, Finney, and Brainerd, the \\"man of prayer.\\" Others, in turn, were encouraged by him and his single-minded focus. When Smith died on January 25, 1986, the accolades poured in. For example, Billy Graham said: > \\"I've lost a dear friend, the man who had more impact on my life than any > other - a great preacher, a great songwriter, a man who stands equal with > Moody and Torrey. As a Missionary Statesman he stands alone. There was no > equal.\\" Also, the Revell Company said: > \\"There is fire in his bones. Those who have heard him have seen fire in his > heart, his eyes, his speech - a fire which has lept out to set them afire.\\" Literature Throughout his life, Smith believed greatly in the printed page. He was the author of 35 books, printed in many languages. These books, such as \\"Passion for Souls,\\" \\"The Man God Uses,\\" and \\"The Enduement of Power\\" have changed lives and encouraged thousands of readers. Billy Graham said, \\"His books have been used of the Holy Spirit to sear into the very depths of my soul and have had a tremendous influence on my personal life.\\" As an editor, Smith published a magazine for 50 years. He also wrote innumerable pamphlets and tracts. On one occasion, Smith said that he may have \\"accomplished more by\\" his \\"books than any other way.\\" Emphases Music always played a major role in Smith's ministry and the continuing program of The Peoples Church. One of Smith's first moves when starting a new work was to have a capable music director so that a choir and orchestra would balance the program of evangelistic preaching. Smith felt that the music would not only be a form of worship in itself but set the tone for the service and encourage the speakers. Furthermore, Smith wrote 1200 hymns, poems, and gospel songs. Smith's emphasis on faith included his approach to financial giving, \\"The Faith Promise Offering.\\" He felt that most Christians would respond to a promise between themselves and God. They would be asked to make it in complete dependency that God would undertake. He was known for saying, \\"Cash isn't needed. In dependence upon God, I will endeavour to give. No one will ask you for it - it's between you and God.\\" Then he would call to sing \\"Step Out in Faith\\" as the money envelopes poured in with financial gifts. Sacrificial giving was encouraged as well as early habits of giving something regularly, no matter how small. Second or third gifts were called envelopes of repentance. Smith was also known for saying, \\"I know people who have two pairs of shoes!\\" People often \\"gave up\\" something to give to world missions. Last years Smith resigned as minister of the Peoples Church in favor of his son Paul on January 1, 1959; however, he retained the position of Minister of Missions and remained actively involved in church work. He died on January 25, 1986. See also * Fundamentalist Christianity#Canada Further reading * The official biography is Fire in His Bones, by Lois Neely. * David R.
