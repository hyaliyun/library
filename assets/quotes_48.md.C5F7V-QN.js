Map current as of 2019 The Islamic scarf controversy in France, referred to there as l'affaire du voile (the veil affair), l'affaire du voile islamique (the Islamic veil affair), and l'affaire du foulard (the scarf affair), arose in 1989, pertaining to the wearing of the hijab in French public schools. It involved issues of the place of Muslim women, differences between Islamic doctrine and Islamic tradition, the conflict between communitarianism and the French policy of minority assimilation, discussions of the \\"Islamist threat\\" to French society and of Islamophobia, and of strict secularity in state institutions. The 2004 headscarf ban led to reduced socioeconomic integration of Muslim women in France. History The controversy over the Islamic scarf (hijab) was sparked on 18 September 1989, when three female students were suspended for refusing to remove their scarves in class at Gabriel Havez Middle School in Creil. In November 1989, the Conseil d'√âtat ruled that the scarf's quasi religious expression was compatible with the la√Øcit√© of public schools. That December, minister of education Lionel Jospin issued a statement declaring that educators had the responsibility of accepting or refusing the wearing of the scarf in classes on a case-by-case basis.\\"Beneath the Veil: Muslim Girls and Islamic Headscarves in Secular France\\" by Nicky Jones, Macquarie Law Journal, 2009 In January 1990, three girls were suspended from Louis Pasteur Middle School in Noyon, a city in Picardy. The parents of one of the girls previously suspended from Gabriel Havez filed a defamation suit against its principal. Following these events, teachers at a middle school in Nantua held a general strike in protest against the scarf in school. A second government statement reiterated the need to respect the principle of secularity in public schools. In September 1994, a new memorandum, the \\"Fran√ßois Bayrou memo\\", was issued, delineating the difference between \\"discreet\\" religious symbols able to be brought into classrooms, and \\"ostentatious\\" religious symbols (including the hijab), which were to be forbidden in public establishments. In October of that year, students at Saint-Exup√©ry High School in Mantes-la-Jolie organized a demonstration of protest in favor of the right to wear the veil in classrooms. In November, 24 veiled students were suspended from the same high school as well as from Faidherbe High in Lille. Between 1994 and 2003, around 100 female students were suspended or expelled from middle and high schools for wearing the scarf in class. In nearly half of these cases, their exclusions were annulled by the French courts. Political and cultural context =Political positions= The most debated point is whether or not students have the right to wear the scarf in classes in public establishments such as primary and secondary schools, as well as universities. Meanwhile, the controversy has contributed to discussions of the principle of secularism, which is the foundation of the 1905 law of separation of church and state in France. The two principal positions that have emerged are: * A complete preservation of the \\"principle of secularism\\" as an element of freedom. This is the position taken most notably by Jacques Chirac as well as by certain leftists such as Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement. * An abandonment of the principle of secularity for the benefit of total religious freedom, and for the recognition of religious communities. This Anglo-Saxon-based community model was defended most notably by Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as some leftists and certain Greens. This debate has thus contributed in blurring the limits between the left and right on the traditional spectrum in France, and has revealed divergences on new political levels, especially between \\"republicans\\" (proponents of intervention by the secular Republic) and \\"liberals\\" (in an older sense of the French term referring to those who support the liberties of the individual). =Muslim tradition= The tradition of the headscarf itself has been in existence since before the advent of Islam, and depictions of Mary, mother of Jesus, show her wearing a hair covering. In Orthodox Judaism, many married women cover their hair with a form of headscarf, called a \\"tichel\\". The importance assigned to head covering varies, from that of colorful head scarves that do not conceal much hair in sub-Saharan Africa, to head scarves that cover the hair and neck to the extent that it should cover all hair, as worn in much of the world, to clothes that cover parts of the face (Yemen), and in Saudi Arabia, the entire body, must be covered by the veil (burqa), as is the case in some areas of Pakistan. In most Muslim societies, this obligation is not enforced by law.Map showing prevalence of Hijab wear across the world and indicating countries where there are restrictions on wearing it. In Egypt and Turkey, for example, wearing the scarf is controversially forbidden in certain professional contexts. In reality, un-veiled Muslim women are a common sight in cities such as Istanbul, Karachi, Islamabad, and Rabat. However, the obligation is legally enforced in certain countries such as Iran, and those who violate such laws are legally culpable for their dress. =Motivations of French Muslims who wear the scarf= The wearing of the scarf or hijab in France, and in the main countries of origin of French Muslims (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey), is a relatively recent phenomenon that is at its core a general movement toward the traditional values of communities in and from these countries. Movements of this kind are not limited to the Muslim world, and can be observed in many different cultures, including those of the West. This phenomenon has been coined \\"the new veiling\\" by A.E. MacLeod. This model does not always materialize perfectly or uniformly according to orthodox tradition; the veils of French Muslim women tend to be less austere in their use of color and material. Other perhaps more specifically France-centered arguments were voiced at the time of this controversy in order to justify students' wearing of the scarf in public schools: * \\"Respectability\\" and \\"discretion.\\" News, movies, and music aimed at young men often contain stereotypical \\"easy girl\\" characters who are sexually taken at will and who are always un-scarfed.Description of musical clips containing such stereotypes. Numerous analysts (example , another example , another example by the same author ) and coupled with 41% of French in an (ipsos survey ) consider the image of women in advertising to be degrading. This leads many to entertain the idea that women who show their hair are not respectable and are offered (or are offering themselves) sexually to everyone. More generally, advertising and the media present a standard model of how Western women may be assumed to be. This vision of Western women offered by media may lead French Muslim women to wear the veil to affirm their respectability and their independence in respect to their families.This argument (\\"the veil gets them out of the house\\") is taken in \\"Le Foulard et la R√©publique\\", by Fran√ßoise Gaspard and Farhad Khosrokhavar, ed. La D√©couverte, 1995. Some veiled women, while very independent, are using the traditional argument for discretion in order to insist on their right to wear the veil at school.Example of such a course: sisters Alma and Lila L√©vy seen in the newspaper \\"L'Humanit√©\\" . Sociologist Fran√ßoise Gaspard speaks of a \\"demanded veil\\". * Muslim identity in the face of what is considered French bigotry against Muslims.There are no objective givens on the level of racism felt by Muslims in France. As far as French people in general, a survey carried out in September 2003, by the BSA Institute gives an idea of the level of racism in France, real or felt. According to this survey, 87% of French people consider racism to be widespread in their country (see p.569 of the French version of the report). However, 14% of French people express racist ideas (p.576). Wearing the scarf is also a way for French Muslim women to guard their identity. * Avoidance of violence in poor neighborhoods, where unveiled women are not safe since they may be targeted for attack by Islamic morality patrols (a concept of the Wahhabi school of thought, a minorityA map of the schools of Islam. which is criticizedSchools of Islam, particularly Sunnis, the largest school of Islam, heavily criticizes Wahhabis for being radical and violent(see here). by other schools of Islam). According to a 2008 study by Stephen Croucher in the Journal of Intercultural Communication Research, \\"Muslims deem the Islamic veil or hijab to be a fundamental part of their identity.\\" Muslims believe that the hijab or veil is symbol of Islam that should not fall under the French idea of secularism. Thus, many French-Muslims claimed that the law banning the veil in public schools was aimed at \\"forcefully integrating\\" the Muslim population by restricting their identity. There also exists a notable minority of French non-Muslims who have expressed support for the right to wear the veil in public schools.There is no internet site representing this group. On the following sites, there can be found passages by and interviews with members of this group, entirely or partially on the scarf: (tout particuli√®rement les quatre derniers paragraphes) =Motivations of French people opposed to allowing hijabs to be worn in schools= Feminist arguments According to some feminist groups, as well as some human rights advocacy groups, wearing the scarf can symbolize a woman's submission to men. The theme of the scarf as a symbol of submission of the woman to the man is found in many a discourse. Among them are: \\"Les Chiennes de Garde\\": \\"It's the symbol of the oppression of women, of a demonization of the body and women's sexuality\\" (communiqu√© , 7 March 2005), \\"Les Penelopes\\": \\"Veiled, they are property of masters who designate them, to others and to the girls themselves, as that which is forbidden.\\" (article published on the website of this association) la Ligue des Droits de l'Homme: \\"The LDH recalls its hostility to the veil, a symbol of oppression for many women\\" (communiqu√© , 6 January 1997). These views are still held despite women being made free individuals from the advent of Islam, where they had previously been inherited property in pre- Islamic cultures. This is also expressed by individuals: Mohamed Kacimi , novelist of Algerian origin: \\"The veil is an antiquated alienation\\", Sylviane Agacinsky, philosopher: \\"The veil symbolizes submission to male authority\\" It is feared that permitting the veil in schools risks opening the door to other practices that exist in the Muslim world.Among them are: the burka used in Afghanistan and Pakistan. arranged marriages that exist, to varying degrees, in many countries of the Muslim world. female circumcision, practiced by Muslims in 28 countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in Egypt, Oman, Yemen, and the UAE. It is often speculated that forbidding the hijab would limit freedom. Rather, the argument put forward by some feminists is that the hijab is not a free choice, but a result of social pressures (i.e., if a law does not forbid the practice of wearing the hijab, social pressure may render it obligatory). This argument is put forward by many, including: Jean-Louis Debr√©: \\"Rare indeed must be the [phenomenon of] young women who spontaneously wear [the veil] spontaneously, outside any pressure from their family or from where they live.\\" (site of the National Assembly) Alain Madelin: \\"Certainly, one can hope that the prohibition of the Islamic veil in school will be dissuasive and that many young women will find in the application of this law a way to escape the social pressure more or less against their will.\\" (\\"Le Monde\\" , 7 February 2004) Fad√©la Amara , president of the Neither Whores Nor Submissive association: \\"I would also like to talk about the girls who don't wear the veil and who are threatened by this pressure that is brought on only by these [other] girls who wear the veil. You really have to understand that in a city today, a girl who wears the veil is respectable, and if she doesn't, she isn't.\\" These arguments are shared by some Islamic feminists. Thus, Fadela Amara, the former president of the organisation Ni Putes Ni Soumises, stated that: \\"The veil is the visible symbol of the subjugation of women, and therefore has no place in the mixed, secular spaces of France's public school system.\\" Another francophone Muslim influential for his work on public welfare, , shares the view of these Islamic feminists and similarly expressed support for Tunisia's ban on the veil in public workplaces in those terms: \\"If today we accept the headscarf, tomorrow we'll accept that women's rights to work and vote and receive an education be banned and they'll be seen as just a tool for reproduction and housework.\\" Secularism arguments Certain individuals and associations consider the scarf to be a symbol of belonging to the Muslim community. According to this line of reasoning, women who wear the veil display their religious and community affiliation, which harms the unity and secularism of the French Republic. Examples of texts which use this argument: an article from \\"l'Humanit√©\\" an interview with Bernard Stasi in the paper \\"La Croix\\". The position of the French government is that secularism in schools is incompatible with wearing ostentatious religious articles, whatever they be. However, in December 2003, President Chirac extended this policy for all public secondary education establishments, risking fanning the tensions between communities within the multicultural French society. France is home to both the largest Jewish and Muslim minorities in Western Europe. Educators A strong majorityAccording to a survey of teachers carried out from the 22nd to the 24th of January, 2004 by the CSA Institute; 79% of teachers consider the veil incompatible with public service and education of French educators opposes the veil in general, and particularly in classes. General public The majority of French people, according to a survey conducted in the last four months of 2003,On the same site are listed the results of four surveys carried out in October and December, 2003. In each of them, an absolute majority of persons questioned answer in favor of a law forbidding the veil in public schools. responded that they would be in favor of a law forbidding the veil in schools. In 2013, 86% of respondents in a poll for i-T√©l√© were in favour of a ban for headscarfs and other religious and political symbols in both public and private institutions for children. The poll was made after the Court of Cassation ruled that a private cr√®che did not have the right to fire a woman who wore an Islamic headscarf.Pascale √âgr√©: Loi sur le port du voile : le d√©bat relanc√© Le Parisien, 25 March 2013 =Motivations of French people who do not oppose the hijab= According to the same surveys, more than 30% (about 10% of the population of France is Muslim) of the French do not want a law forbidding the veil in schools. Conversely, more than 60% of the French population (about 10% of the population of France is Muslim) want a law forbidding the veil in schools. Many individuals and organizations have been opposed to the idea of a law forbidding the veil since it was first proposed. The collective \\"Les Bl√©dardes\\" sees the controversy over the veil as a manifestation of colonialist sentiments. In 2003, they demand: \\"Give the veiled girls back their status as students - democracy and the State of justice will come out of this more mature, just as they matured through the rehabilitation of the Dreyfus Affair.\\"Among authors of this text are Houria Boutelja, founder of the \\"Les Bl√©dardes\\" collective and Laurent L√©vy, father of Alma and Lila L√©vy (see 4). However, Laurent L√©vy himself cannot be considered in favor of the veil in schools: \\"The choice of young women to hide their hair, ears, and neck is decidedly regrettable - because of what it symbolizes.\\" Furthermore, some Islamic feminists have expressed offense at double standards implicit in some (non-Muslim) feminist arguments. Thus, when some feminists began defending the headscarf on the grounds of \\"tradition\\", Fadela Amara countered: \\"It's not tradition, it's archaic! French feminists are totally contradictory. When Algerian women fought against wearing the headscarf in Algeria, French feminists supported them. But when it's some young girl in a French suburb school, they don't. They define liberty and equality according to what colour your skin is. It's nothing more than neocolonialism.\\" Some would argue that the government attempting to protect Muslim women from the supposed repressiveness of the hijab is a form of paternalism. The banning of the hijab can be viewed as just another way of controlling how women dress by a patriarchal society. A third interpretation of the principle of secularity based on its original formulation recalls that, according to the law, \\"all are equal to show and express their religious opinions in public as well as in private\\", and that the French state has the responsibility to guarantee access to free, public education to all Frenchmen. Another argument is that making it illegal sends a message that hate crimes may be more tolerable. An obvious concern that arises is what would qualify as an offensive scarf. The Islamic requirement for a 'Hijab' is to cover the hair and neck in combination to not wearing tight fitting clothing. As such, Muslim women could wear a combination of a hat and scarf which would qualify as a 'Hijab' but would not be obviously religious. Law and its application =Vote= In December 2003, President Jacques Chirac decided that a law should explicitly forbid any visible sign of religious affiliation in public schools, \\"in the spirit of secularism\\". The law, sometimes referred to as \\"the veil law\\", was voted in by the French parliament in March 2004. It forbids the wearing of any \\"ostentatious\\" religious articles, including the Islamic veil, the Jewish kippa, and large Christian crosses. The law permits discreet signs of faith, such as small crosses, Stars of David, and hands of Fatima. =Education= In many cases, the exact extent of possible application of the law is hard to ascertain, and has led to further complications: For example, is the law applicable to something other than the Islamic veil which covers the hair, such as a bandana, which does not outwardly indicate religious affiliation? Eventually, the case was settled in court (see below). Would veiled parents be able to enter their children's schools? Former education minister Fran√ßois Fillon has stated that the law does not apply whatsoever to the parents of students. The Mediator of the Republic has agreed with this stance. However, in some cities, such as Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, where integration of large numbers of Muslims is an acute problem, veiled parents are frequently denied entry. In May 2005, the mother of a student was denied permission to run a stand at her son's school festival. After much publicity, the interdiction was lifted. On May 14, 2007, the High authority for the struggle against discrimination and for equality (HALDE) affirmed that veiled parents should be allowed to attend school activities. While the law forbidding the veil applies to students attending publicly funded primary schools and high schools, it does not refer to universities. Applicable legislation grants them freedom of expression as long as public order is preserved. However, veiled students are sometimes denied attendance. In 2019, controversy surrounding the law erupted when a Muslim woman chaperoning her son's school field trip was told to remove her veil, sparking a debate regarding the right of private citizens to wear the scarf while taking part in school activities. Far Right politicians pushed for a ban on the scarf in such situations, citing the fact that students had to adhere to a ban on all religious head-coverings, and thus mothers should abide by the same rules. French Prime Minister √âdouard Philippe defended the right of mothers to wear the hijab, claiming that secularism meant defending the religious freedoms of the people. However, French Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, despite acknowledging the right of women to wear as they pleased, expressed his wish that mothers would not wear the hijab on school trips. Others from Emmanuel Macron's centrist party also expressed some support for a ban on the hijab on school trips. Others within the party expressed their opposition to those sentiments. Public personalities also came out against the statements. In an open letter, 90 public personalities signed an open letter calling on Macron to come out in support of Muslim mothers wearing the ban on school trips. =Other situations= In public hospitals, employees are expected to respect the principle of secularism. In nursing schools, interviews are an official requirement for entry, during which applicants may be asked if they are willing to remove their veil either altogether or for the purpose of wearing a disposable cap, such as those worn in operating rooms. As far as patients are concerned, the rule is to respect religious preferences. =Jurisprudence= Some court decisions have clarified issues remained open by the law, and its legality. These jurisprudence were issued by the French administrative Supreme Court Conseil d'Etat, and by the European Court of Human Rights. Wearing items not outwardly indicating religious affiliation The Conseil d'√âtat affirmed on 5 December 2007 that the ban also apply to clothing elements that demonstrate a religious affiliation only because of the behaviour of the student. Wearing either a Sikh subturban or a bandana were then denied by the supreme court.Council of State decision Chain v. France Council of State decision Bessam v. France Infringement of right to practice a religion and right to education On 4 December 2008, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) affirmed the legality of the ban. Although the cases dated prior to the 2004 law, the Court rationale was consistent with the law: the ECHR held that the national authorities were obliged to take great care to ensure that (...) the manifestation by pupils of their religious beliefs on school premises did not take on the nature of an ostentatious act that would constitute a source of pressure and exclusion. In 2012, UN Human Rights Committee has found a violation of ICCPR in case of expulsion of a Sikh from a school based on the 2004 law.HRC views in case Singh v. France Communication No. 1852/2008 Controversies over legal prohibition Throughout the process of legislation banning religious head-scarves in France, it has been met with widely varied reactions. On 12 of August 2016, the mayor of Cannes in southern France banned full-body swimsuits known as \\"burkinis\\" from the beach, because it was considered as [a] symbol of Islamic extremism and might spark tensions, as France is the target of Islamist attacks. Since the mayor's decision, the French council of the state has fully endorsed the Burkini ban, so that the French police were tasked with forcing any Muslim woman who appears in public with a burkini to remove it. In France, particularly on Nice beach, near to the location of the terrorist lorry attack where 84 people killed on Bastille Day, four armed police officers holding handguns, batons, and pepper spray forced a Muslim woman, who seemed to be sleeping on the beach, to take off her burkini protecting her modesty. The woman was warned about the new dress code on the beach. In addition, she was fined 38 euro for wearing the swim wear, and four women were fined 38 euros for wearing their burkinis on the beach in Cannes. On the 25 August 2016, the Human Rights League and anti-Islamophobia groups described the ban as a dangerous and illegal threat on basic freedoms, particularly freedom of belief and religion. The UN, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Canada have criticised and ruled out France's ban on the burkini, claiming it is a very clear violation of human rights, and it does not respect Muslim women's dignity or modesty. The burkini bans have triggered a fierce debate about the wearing of the full-body swimsuit, women's rights, and the French state's strictly guarded secularism. After hearing the arguments from Human rights groups and some other countries, the France's highest administrative court was to rule on whether to overturn the ban on wearing the full-body burkini swimsuit. =Alma and Lila L√©vy= Alma and Lila L√©vy are sisters who rose to fame at the centre of the French controversy over the veil in 2003 when they were expelled from school. The controversial expulsion of the L√©vy sisters from Lyc√©e Henri-Wallon, in the suburb of Aubervilliers of Paris, ignited an international debate. The L√©vy sisters were expelled for wearing the hijab. The girls' father, Laurent L√©vy, a Jewish French lawyer, was quick to point out the anti-semitic furore regarding the media's focus on his ethnicity, \\"I am Jewish by Vichy rules.\\" In an interview with the BBC, he explained that his ex-wife, his daughters' mother, is a Muslim from Kabyle, Algeria. The sisters wrote a book about their experience. Practical consequences The veil controversy and its legislative consequences have revealed problems associated with the practice of the Islamic faith insofar as religion in French society and institutions (as opposed to the problems of integration of individuals). Partially fueled by the fear of a \\"communitarization\\" or \\"Islamization\\" of French society, the controversy has also fed off fears in certain sections of the Muslim community in France of \\"forced assimilation\\" and a slippery slope that would seek to ban more and more expressions of the Muslim faith. The controversy has also, however, brought the issue of the place of Islam in French society to the forefront of debate. The veil controversy has been used opportunely to promote the expression of a French form of Islam, distinct from the Islam in the French Muslims' countries of origin. The presence of Muslim Frenchwomen wearing tricolour veils and shouting, \\"I am French!\\" in protests in Paris against the law forbidding the veil is one example thereof. A survey conducted by the French polling organization CSA in January 2004, revealed that more than 90% of French Muslims claim to subscribe to culturally French principles such as the importance of the Republic and equal rights among men and women. The figure falls to 68% for respondents who believe in the separation of church and state. In contrast, a majority (50‚Äì60%) of those surveyed responded unfavorably to the law of la√Øcit√©, and would prefer to see their wife or daughter free to wear the veil. In 2004, a year after the law was voted in, one organization opposed to it, called the \\"Committee of the 15th of March and Liberty\\", published a report on the law's effects. The report cites the files of 806 students affected by the law. Of the 806 students, 533 have accepted the law and no longer wear their veils in class.On the beginning of the 2004 scholastic year, a very small minority of Muslim students chose to shave their heads in order not to show their hair while at the same time obeying the letter of the law. The report also gives an assessment of students who have left the French school system because of this issue. Among them, 67 have pursued their studies abroad. Another 73 of those 806 suspended or expelled from schools over the veil have chosen to take government-run correspondence courses in order to finish their studies. The number of those who have chosen to study via other, non-government forms of correspondence schools is unknown. The opening of the 2005 school year passed largely without incident, and opposition to the law seems to have given way to broader public opinion. However, the actual number of those who no longer attend French junior high and high schools over their veils is unknown. Banning of full face covering in public In 2010, a public debate arose and France passed a law that bans the wearing of full-face covering, including but not limited to burqas and niqƒÅbs, in public. The law was constitutionally cleared so that it came into force in April 2011. That debate and ban are separate from the above-discussed debate on the hijab in public schools, in that the new law does not pertain to Islamic scarves but rather to the much rarer full-face versions, as well as other full-face coverings (such as masks and balaclavas), and in that the new law applies to all citizens in public spaces regardless of religion or claimed tradition (and regardless of gender).

In 2012 Thomas Holtz gave a possible length of 11 meters (36 feet). History and description Holotype The partial braincase that became the type specimen of Piveteausaurus was first described in 1923 by French paleontologist Jean Piveteau in illustrations and photographs of the specimen (MNHN 1920-7). The braincase is comparable in size to that of a large Allosaurus, and resembles that of another megalosauroid, Piatnitzkysaurus from Argentina.Rauhut, 2004. Braincase structure of the Middle Jurassic theropod dinosaur Piatnitzkysaurus. Canadian Journal of Earth Science. 41, 1109-1122. Piveteau grouped this partial skull with other specimens found earlier in that locality and described in 1808 by French naturalist Georges Cuvier. In 1861 English paleontologist Richard Owen assigned the fragments to the species Streptospondylus cuvieri, and Piveteau included the skull he found in the same species. MNHN 1920-7 was found by local collector Dutacq in rocks thought to be Oxfordian (Upper Jurassic), of the Vaches Noires cliffs near Dives in Normandy, France, and was after being reported by amateur geologist Cazenave in 1920 acquired by Professor Marcellin Boule for the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle. Later these rocks were reevaluated as older (Upper Callovian, Middle Jurassic, ~164 million years old). Hypothetical restoration MNHN 1920-7 was reevaluated in 1964 by Alick Walker as part of his work on Ornithosuchus and the evolution of the Carnosauria. He assigned MNHN 1920-7 to Eustreptospondylus as the holotype, or type specimen, of the new species E. divesensis. The other bone fragments described by Cuvier and attributed to S. cuvieri by Owen were also transferred, as a \\"matter of convenience,\\" but without conviction on the part of Walker, to the new species, E. divesensis. It was given its own genus in 1977 by Philippe Taquet and Samuel Welles: Piveteausaurus, named after Piveteau. Taquet and Welles removed the postcranial bones, conveniently associated with the skull by Walker, from the species. Later the braincase would be regarded by Gregory S. Paul as a species of Proceratosaurus (P. divesensis), but this assignment was rejected by other researchers. While the braincase appears to be distinct, the limited remains mean Piveteausaurus has not been easy to classify. It has been compared to Ceratosaurus, Eustreptospondylus, and Proceratosaurus, and was interpreted as a species of the latter two genera at various times. Classification Piveteausaurus was originally regarded as a megalosaurid as a \\"matter of convenience\\", as its describers did not want to name a new family for such fragmentary remains. Tom Holtz and colleagues (2004) considered it to be an indeterminate member of Tetanurae, though they did not include it in a phylogenetic analysis. The first such analysis was performed by Benson in 2010. He found that while its exact placement was unresolved, it always grouped with a member of the clade Megalosauridae, and so most likely belonged to that family. The phylogenetic position of Piveteausaurus according to Carrano et al. (2012) is shown by this cladogram:M.T. Carrano, R.B.J. Benson, and S.D.

It is just a short distance north of the Cementerio de la Chacarita,Estaci√≥n Federico Lacroze - Tren Urquiza the city's largest cemetery. The station is named after Federico Lacroze, a prominent 19th century Argentine railway and transport pioneer who obtained the concession for building the Buenos Aires Central Railway in 1884. When the Argentine railway network was nationalised in 1948 the station became the Buenos Aires terminus for the lines that became part of the General Urquiza Railway (FCGU). History The station was named after railway entrepreneur Federico Lacroze. Former Chacarita station, terminus of Tramway Rural, c. 1880s. The building would be replaced by the current terminal. The first station to open was \\"Chacarita\\" terminus, a precarious building that served as terminal for the Buenos Aires Central Railway, originally a horse-drawn railway established by entrepreneur Federico Lacroze that built and operated a line to cities of Z√°rate in Buenos Aires and 4 de Febrero in Santa Fe.Ferrocarril Urquiza - Historia, Metrov√≠as website The station would be later demolished. The current underground station had been designed by the Lacroze Brothers with the intention of being a connection with the Buenos Aires Central Railway. The tunnels and parts of the original station are used for Line B to this day.Construcci√≥n de t√∫neles de subte - EnElSubte, 24 August 2008 The current terminal was designed by Argentine architect Santiago Mayaud-Maisonneuve and his son Carlos in 1951, following the Rationalist style of architecture.

The building received protected status in 2009.M√°s piezas para el cat√°logo - Pagina/12, 30 May 2009  Services  The station functions primarily as a commuter rail station but also handles some long-distance services. The local transit company Metrov√≠as, which also manages the Buenos Aires Underground system, operates regular electric commuter train services every 10‚Äì20 minutes into the nearby Buenos Aires suburbs along its Urquiza Line. Stations on this line include Villa Devoto, Mart√≠n Coronado (which also serves Ciudad Jard√≠n), Hurlingham and San Miguel amongst others. In the past, the station also served as the terminal for the long-distance service to Misiones Province, however this service has been suspended as of 2012. F. Lacroze - Ap√≥stoles - Posadas - Sat√©lite Ferroviario Following railway privatisation in Argentina, the private railway company Trenes Especiales Argentinos (TEA) operated long-distance passenger services to the city of Posadas in the very north of Argentina on the border with Paraguay. The service used the standard gauge network of the General Urquiza Railway which runs through the provinces of Buenos Aires, Entre R√≠os, Corrientes and Misiones. This train stopped at many places on the way including Z√°rate in Buenos Aires Province, Basavilbaso and Villaguay in Entre R√≠os Province, Monte Caseros and Santo Tom√© in Corrientes Province. In 2012 the service was briefly taken over by Trenes de Buenos Aires, however their concession was revoked by the National Government on the same year and remains without an operator to this day. There have been numerous calls for the return of the service given the large-scale reactivation of many of the country's railways since 2014, however as of 2015, the service remains suspended.¬øNo saben c√≥mo hacer a un pueblo fel√≠z?.

More atmospheric and brooding than its predecessor The Blurred Crusades jangling psychedelia and upbeat rock, it shows a greater use of keyboards, with the guitars taking largely textural roles on many songs. While numerous tracks have become fan favorites over the years, the album saw considerably less success in Australia than previous releases and had limited exposure internationally. Apart from the psychedelic noise experiment \\"Travel By Thought\\", which prefigures the band's extended improvised tracks of the 1990s and beyond, all songs were written solely by Steve Kilbey. The album's most notorious aspect, both amongst the fan base and the band members themselves, is the heavy use of gated reverb on the drum sound, particularly on the single \\"Electric Lash\\" where the snare fills have been likened to a \\"machine gun\\". This was the work of mixing engineer Nick Launay who refused to remove the effect despite the disapproval of the band. Despite this frequent criticism, the tracks \\"One Day,\\" \\"It's No Reason\\" and \\"Now I Wonder Why\\" are often considered stand-outs in the band's repertoire. The album yielded two minor hits - \\"It's No Reason\\" and \\"Electric Lash\\" - and stayed in the British independent charts for several months.

Waldo's career was often directed against a scientific/technical portrayal of bureaucracy and government that now suggests the term public management as opposed to public administration. Recognized the world over for his contributions to the theory of bureaucratic government, Waldo is only now taking his place as one of the most important political scientists of the last 100 years. Life and career Born in rural DeWitt, Nebraska, and trained first in a local Wesleyan college and then a Nebraska normal school as a teacher, Waldo was eventually educated in political theory at the University of Nebraska (MA) and Yale University (PhD) where he was advised by Francis Coker. He came to shape much of the future of scholarship in the field of Public Administration. His Yale dissertation was reworked after civil service during World War II into a classic work of public administration called The Administrative State, published in 1948. Waldo challenged mainstream scholars' view of public administration as a value-free, non-partisan social science that promised to make government more efficient and effective. Professor Camilla Stivers has observed, \\"Despite public administration's claim to be a science, Waldo declares, it is a political theory [....] Political theory looks to error in the world and aims to envision new possibilities. It is critical rather than objective, suggestive rather than conclusive.\\"\\"The Significance of The Administrative State\\", Public Administration Review, Jan/Feb. 2008, pp. 53‚Äì56. Retrieved on 2008-10-08. In short, \\"efficiency\\" itself is a value, and it can run counter to other values, such as democratic participation in governance. Waldo also is famous for the debate he had with Herbert A. Simon on the nature of bureaucracy in American Political Science Review just after World War II. Eventually he taught at the University of California, Berkeley and the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, and Virginia Tech where he influenced many future scholars of government. He had profound influence on a number of young academics in the late 1960s by organizing the Minnowbrook Conference. Others deeply indebted to Waldo for guidance and sponsorship include H.

An affiliate of the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins and New York Rangers, the Cubs were coached by former Bruin Bronco Horvath and they won the EHL's Central Division championship in their first year of play. When the EHL folded, the Cubs became founding members of the North American Hockey League for the 1973-74 season. A poor start on the ice and at the gate resulted in the firing of Horvath. Defenseman Mike De Marco replaced him on an interim basis until the team hired minor league defenseman Nick Polano of the Providence Reds to be player-coach for the remainder of the season. For 1974-75, the team changed its name, its affiliations and its coach, becoming the Cape Codders and signing working agreements with the World Hockey Association's New England Whalers and Cleveland Crusaders. Larry Kish, a former All-America defenseman at Providence College who previously had coached the Rhode Island Eagles and Suncoast Suns, was named coach. The franchise went out of business in 1977.

In the book, Waldo argues that democratic states are underpinned by professional and political bureaucracies and that scientific management and efficiency is not the core idea of government bureaucracy, but rather it is service to the public. The work has contributed to the structure and theory of government bureaucracies the world over and is one of the defining works of public administration and political science written in the last 75 years. The Administrative State was first published in 1948 and later reissued in a second edition with an extensively revised introduction by Waldo.  History of the concept  The phrase ‚Äúthe Administrative State‚Äù was widely used before Dwight Waldo adopted it in 1948, and the concept of administrative powers and responsibilities has been the subject of debate for as long as the structure of democratic government has been implemented. Where the current debate begins is with the United States Constitution, and arguments over the powers are and aren't legitimate under that constitution. The primary debate is over whether or not nonelected agencies of the government have the power to legislate as well as enforce. The argument for the power is that all federal agencies/ officials are subject to the President of the United States, who is elected accommodating the new power democratically so that it does not need to be voted on directly by the public; where the counter is that ‚Äúagencies remain inefficient, ineffective, and undemocratic;‚Äù attempting to justify that the public‚Äôs inability to vote for the policy that the agency adopts is undemocratic/unconstitutional (Harvard Law Review). Dr. Michael Greve, a law professor at George Mason University School of Law, defines the current implemented administrative state of the United States as, ‚Äúa power once known as 'prerogative'‚Äîthat is, the power to make binding rules without law, outside the law, or against the law, exercised by someone other than an elected legislature,\\" which he considers opposite to the intentions of the ‚Äúfounders.\\" Greve's position is that government entities (agencies) are power hungry and that citizens should adhere to the US Constitution with its emphasis on the public good and its safeguards against the despotism of unrestricted administrative agencies. Harvard Law Review notes ‚ÄúThe presidential control model of the administrative state, perhaps most definitively expounded by now- Justice Elena Kagan, suggests that top-down accountability affords agencies a measure of democratic accountability and assures effective administration,\\" i.e. that agency-implemented policy/law is subject to democracy by way of citizens' ability to hold the elected official at the head of the relevant chain of government responsible. They question whether top down responsibility and accountability are efficient enough to prevent government agencies' natural hunger for power from overriding their mandate to act in the best interests of the people.  Ideals of the book  The book posits that an \\"administrative state\\" contains a tension between democracy and bureaucracy that obliges career public servants to protect democratic principles. Waldo's position is that the political versus administrative dichotomy is false, that public servants hold political positions that require more than the mere implementation of policy set by elected officials. Rather, they must negotiate between efficient, scientific management and the demands for due process and public access to government. Government cannot be run like a business where efficiency and profits are highest prority. Honoring the Constitution and other democratic imperatives makes managing a unit of the government far more challenging than a comparable private-sector organization. Waldo introduces the concept of The Great Society which he argues is based upon the private sector. He also points out that in the U.S., business supports the state, while it should be the other way around. In addition, he states that with the evolution of social trends in the U.S., fundamental laws were eroded by modern ideas thus changing the entire concept of government and public administration. As these transitions occurred, new managerial styles emerged (Art Madsen, M.Ed.).  Significance of The Administrative State  Waldo's book had a long lasting effect on politics, administration, and serving the public. It added new dimensions to the study of public administration, including the traditions of democracy, the moral and natural laws guiding public thinking, progressivism, faith in science, and the \\"gospel of efficiency.\\" Waldo's arguments often deal with what government should do. While public administration is often considered as a science, Waldo declared it to be a political theory. Some theories of public administration are defined by tension and others by debate of two different kinds‚Äîscience and politics. Waldo proposes some essential questions about public administration with themes in political philosophy going back to ancient Greece: the nature of the good life, the bases of decision, who should rule, the separation of powers, and centralization of government versus decentralization of government, that still have relevance in the world today. The book's premise that administrators in the public arena must play a policy-making role in government has had a far-reaching impact in the field of public administration.

Childhood, school and university in Breslau (1870‚Äì1881) Czapski was the son of Simon Czapski (1826‚Äì1908) and his wife Rosalie Goldenring (1830-1916) on the Obra estate near Koschmin in the Province of Posen. His family was Jewish,Louis Gershenfeld, The Jew in Science, Jewish Publication Society of America (1934), p. 151 and he was related to the physician Albert Neisser.Paul Weindling, Health, Race and German Politics Between National Unification and Nazism, 1870-1945, Cambridge University Press (1993), p. 127 In 1870 Czapski's father suffered a serious accident which left him unable to work. The family sold their estate and moved to Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) where, in 1872, eleven-year-old Czapski began attending school at the Maria Magdalenen Gymnasium. In 1879 he completed his university entrance examination (together with Wilhelm Prausnitz, Richard Reitzenstein and Felix Skutsch) and spent a semester studying at the University of G√∂ttingen, attending lectures by Eduard Riecke (physics), Moritz Abraham Stern (mathematics) and Rudolf Hermann Lotze (philosophy). At the start of his second semester he switched to the University of Breslau, studying physics under Oskar Emil Meyer, Ernst Dorn and Felix Auerbach, mathematics under Jakob Rosanes and philosophy under Jacob Freudenthal. It was during this period that he embarked on a friendship with Arthur Heidenhain (1862‚Äì1941) which led to a lifelong exchange of letters.  University and doctorate in Berlin (1881‚Äì1884)  In 1881 Czapski switched to the University of Berlin to study under the physicists Hermann von Helmholtz and Gustav Robert Kirchhoff. Here he met Leopold Loewenherz and became interested in experimental physics, which prompted him to start attending more practical, hands-on courses. In 1882 Czapski began work for the Normal-Eichungskommission (Imperial Institute for Weights and Measures) which was headed by the astronomer Wilhelm Julius Foerster. In the autumn of that year he worked on his doctorate under the supervision of Hermann von Helmholtz, in which he conducted experiments to investigate one of Helmholtz's own theories. He submitted his doctoral thesis to Helmholtz and Kirchhoff in November 1883. In December he embarked on his doctoral exams which were held by Helmholtz and Kirchhoff in physics, Leopold Kronecker in mathematics and Eduard Zeller in philosophy. In February 1884 he took his Rigorosum oral examination (doctoral viva) to complete his doctorate.  Technical optics: Carl Zeiss in Jena (1884 onwards)  His interest in physical and technical optics (the design and fabrication of optics) enabled him to gain a position at Carl Bamberg's workshop for scientific precision instruments (subsequently known as the Askania works). Keen to explore these areas in more depth, he approached Ernst Abbe from the Zeiss works in Jena. Abbe soon appointed Czapski as his assistant ‚Äì a post he held until 1886 ‚Äì and involved him in his discussions with the physicist Leonhard Sohncke from the University of Jena. As Abbe's assistant, Czapski maintained a relatively loose connection to Zeiss as a company and continued to accept work from Bamberg, but all that changed in 1886 when he was hired to work full-time at Zeiss, becoming Abbe's most trusted employee with the approval of Carl and Roderich Zeiss). Abbe involved Czapski in his theoretical studies as early as 1885. It was Czapski who went on to publish these studies the following year because Abbe himself had neither the time nor the patience, being too occupied with his development projects. In 1893, after five years of work, Czapski finally completed his contribution to Adolf Winkelmann's Handbuch der Physik (Encyclopedia of physics) entitled Theorie der optischen Instrumente nach Abbe (Theory of optical instruments according to Abbe). The 300-page work was issued that very same year as a separate publication from volume II of the encyclopedia and was hailed as a key work in the field of technical optics. Working with Abbe and Otto Schott in Jena and with Leopold Dippel in Darmstadt, Czapski was involved in the design and fabrication of new microscope optical systems from the moment he started work in Jena. He subsequently worked on the technical implementation of a binocular microscope based on ideas put forward by the American biologist Horatio S. Greenough. As the company expanded, so too did its range of products: Zeiss started producing photographic objectives in 1890, optical measuring instruments in 1892/93, prism binoculars in 1893/94 (a development based on significant input from Czapski), astronomical instruments in 1897 and image measuring devices in 1901. Czapski steadily took on more and more responsibility as Zeiss increased its product portfolio and workforce and as its fame spread far beyond the borders of Germany. In 1891 he became one of the company's three managing directors.  Establishment of the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung  Founded in 1889 by Abbe, the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung (Carl Zeiss Foundation) took the entire Zeiss company and half of the Schott company under its wing in 1891. Czapski was subsequently appointed as an authorized representative of the Foundation. Working closely with Abbe and a foundation inspector from the Grand-Ducal Saxon State Ministry in Weimar (initially Karl Rothe and from 1899 onwards the Government Privy Council Max Vollert), Czapski played an ever greater role in managing the company, something that took an increasing toll on his health. Abbe already had the university trustee Heinrich Eggeling and the lawyer Eduard Rosenthal involved in drawing up the Foundation statutes and he soon included Czapski in that task ‚Äì even though by this point Czapski was increasingly overwhelmed by concerns and problems relating to the workforce. Work on the statutes was completed in 1895/96.  Siegfried and Margarete Czapski  Grave of Siegfried Czapski in Jena In 1885 Czapski's life changed dramatically when he met and fell in love with Margarete Koch. Margarete (officially spelled Marguerite) was the granddaughter of Abbe's teacher, the mathematician and physicist Karl Snell. Margarete's father was a professor at a grammar school in Paris and a nephew of Juliette Drouet, who was Victor Hugo's partner for much of his life. His wife Ottilie Koch (n√©e Snell) often brought their daughter to visit her father in Jena. Ottilie was also the sister of Abbe's wife, Else Abbe. It was inevitable that 24-year-old Czapski and 19-year-old Margarete Koch would eventually meet. Just weeks after getting to know each other they got engaged, secretly at first. They agreed that they would marry when Margarete turned 21. The wedding took place on August 11, 1887. Their marriage produced eight children: * 1888 Charlotte (\\"Lotte\\") * 1889 Hans * 1891-1968 Helene, married name Holzman * 1892 Ewald * 1894 Elisabeth, married Wilhelm Flitner * 1896 Dorothea * July 13, 1902 Reinhardt * December 22, 1903 Anna-Maria (\\"Anni\\") Czapski had long been suffering from ill health, and his huge workload made the situation even more difficult. On June 29 in Weimar, he died of a pulmonary embolism due to complications after an appendectomy. Having been the close working companion of his friend and mentor Ernst Abbe, and ultimately his successor, Czapski was only destined to outlive Abbe by a mere two-and-a-half years.  Honor  A street in Jena, near the Carl Zeiss works, is named after him: Siegfried-Czapski-Stra√üe, a few blocks off Zeiss Promenade.

The root tat is equivalent to the English word ‚Äúthat,‚Äù while the suffix -tva is used like our suffix ‚Äú-ness,‚Äù giving a sense of ‚Äúthat- ness,‚Äù commonly understood as truth or principle. Para is simply ‚Äúsupreme,‚Äù ‚Äútranscendental‚Äù or ‚Äúabsolute,‚Äù in this context describing the principles of truth in a wholesome context. Two very common conceptions in this day and age amongst students of the Vedas (which includes the core scriptures Rg, Sama, Yajur and Atharva, and may also extend into the vast body of associated peripheral works) are the Hindu tattvas of Brahman and Paramatman, which may be understood respectively as the witness-consciousness (Self as knower) and the Supersoul (supercontrolling Godhead). The mainstream Hindu social class in traditional Vedic culture is the functionary priesthood, and includes teachers and scribes as well as medical practitioners. Those Brahmanas who tend to be theonomous in nature but who relate to Deity more as the absolute Self in its wise or gnostic capacity may be called Brahma-vadis, meaning practitioners of Brahma-vada, the endorsement of Brahma-tattva. Brahmanas and Yogis (deeply meditative saints) who are more progressively theolatrous, whether exoterically or esoterically, may be called Paramatma-vadis. Their relationship with the Deity advances beyond theoretical knowledge of Self into the dynamics of what may be called absolute civilization. Their practice of cosmic consciousness comprehends ontological relationships between the Witness which is the relatively inferior Self and the supercontrolling Godhead, attunement with Whom is the prime requirement for entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven. The Vaishnava school of Vedic theology emphasizes a third significant phase of Para Tattva beyond Brahman and Paramatma. Positioning themselves (the Vaishnavas) as authoritatively superior both socially and spiritually to a non-Vaishnavite Brahmin class, they claim that the real goal of a theistic saint is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, known as Bhagavan. Where Brahma- tattva tends to be perception oriented and Paramatma-tattva concerned with absolute functionality, the tattva of Bhagavan expands into explorations of quality, including and especially the superlative quality of glory which is the feature that reveals the Kingdom of Heaven, known to the Vaishnavas as Vaikuntha. Once Bhagavan is recognized, reality may be comprehended sixfold, according to six essential qualities of divine personality. Where Vishnu is the Supreme Father, Lord of Vaikuntha, He actually has a qualitatively superlative aspect, where He is known as Lord Rama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as personification of the highest quality of glory, Whose mood is actually more intimate and friendly. On the other hand, where Vishnu's absolute fatherhood leans more toward the relatively impersonal functionality of Paramatma, He becomes represented as Shiva, Who may be compared to the Holy Ghost. This phase is recognized by the Vaishnavas in terms of the quality of strength. Backing down the qualitative ladder from Bhagavan Lord Rama's superlative glory, through the strength represented by Paramatma Shiva, our study returns to the quality of wisdom or knowledge personified by Brahma, who is the first created Son of Father Vishnu, and may therefore be compared to the Christ. Understanding this much, then, gives us half the picture of Para Tattva, and is the framework of what may be called the right-handed path. Lord Rama (the original Vishnu) as Bhagavan is all-glorious, Shiva as Paramatma is all-powerful, and Brahma who is Brahma-tattva is all wise. Three qualities, however, remain to be examined. The Vedic tradition initially portrays reality as fourfold, and this qualitative framework may gradually be comprehended in a broader context once the left-handed path is added to the relatively simplistic design which begins beneath Brahma's position and extends upwardly beyond Lord Rama's kingdom. The fourth aspect of Deity Whom we find beyond the glorious Rama is described by the Veda as the all-beautiful Krishna, Whose alluring pastimes are lovingly worshipped by many devotees all over the world. At the other extreme end of fourfold reality is a fifth entity known as Sudarshana, the original Chakra who is Lord Vishnu's weapon of absolute destruction and therefore represents the fifth quality of Bhagavan which is detachment. Thus far we have covered five of six qualities of Bhagavan, which outline the traditional fourfold path: beauty (Krishna), glory (Rama), strength (Shiva), knowledge (Brahma) and detachment (Sudarshana). Now one last principle can be observed as connecting the two ends of our envisioned framework of reality, this being the quality of possession, which is personified by a lesser-known aspect of Bhagavan whose name is Chaitanya. Chaitanya is connected negatively through possessiveness to Sudarshana's detachment through his exhibition of renunciation, and positively through possessiveness to Krishna's beauty through loving devotion. In this way, Bhagavan realization advances our initial studies of Para Tattva into a full- circle comprehension of quality.

The arena was originally owned by Yarmouth real estate agent William Harrison and cost $1.5 million to build. In 1976, the arena was sold to Ed Fruean who owned Coliseum for three years before selling it to Vince McMahon in 1979. In 1984, McMahon sold the building to Christmas Tree Shops who chose to utilize it as a warehouse. The final event, a World Wrestling Federation event, occurred on June 4, 1984. Sports Vince McMahon utilized the arena for World Wrestling Entertainment, then known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), events from 1979 through 1984. It was home to both the Cape Cod Cubs/Cape Codders of the North American Hockey League (1973‚Äì77), the Cape Cod Freedoms of the Northeastern Hockey League (1978‚Äì1979), and the Cape Cod Buccaneers of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League (1981‚Äì82).

It was first published in 1875 to great controversy. Background E√ßa finished the first draft of this novel in 1875. He sent it to some friends who ran a literary magazine, with the request that they return the proofs so he could edit them. However, they began to serialise the story without allowing him to see the proofs. He subsequently revised the novel and submitted it to a publisher in 1876 but it was barely noticed by the public. E√ßa then wrote Cousin Bazilio, returning to The Crime of Father Amaro only after the publication of Cousin Bazilio in 1878. The third version involved an extensive rewrite and was described by E√ßa as \\"an entirely new novel\\". Plot summary The novel concerns a young priest, Amaro, who serves as diocesan administrator at Leiria. Amaro lacks a vocation, having been pushed into the priesthood by his aristocratic patrons, the Marquesa de Alegros and, later, the Conde de Ribamar, and, owing to the vow of chastity he was obliged to take, is obsessed with women and deeply sexually frustrated. Upon arriving in Leiria, he falls for Am√©lia, the beautiful daughter of his landlady, a pious widow and the mistress of his superior, Canon Dias. After Am√©lia's fianc√©, Jo√£o Eduardo, publishes an expos√© of the local clergy's venal habits in the town's newspaper under a pseudonym, Amaro and his colleagues and parishioners expose Jo√£o Eduardo as the author of the piece, pressure Am√©lia to break off the engagement, and drive Jo√£o Eduardo out of town. Amaro begins a sexual relationship with Am√©lia, meeting first in his coal cellar and then in the bell-ringer's house, using charitable visits to his bedridden, mentally disabled daughter as a cover. His love affair with Am√©lia ends in tragedy when she becomes pregnant and is forced to seclude herself in the countryside for the duration of the pregnancy in order to prevent a scandal. Jo√£o Eduardo returns to Leiria, and there is talk of convincing him to marry Am√©lia and hence make the child legitimate, but this does not come to pass. Amaro and his maid, Dionisia, who also acts as a midwife, find a wet-nurse who, it is implied, kills babies in her care. Am√©lia gives birth to a healthy boy, who is handed over to the wet-nurse by Amaro and killed. Am√©lia suffers complications after the birth and dies of a burst aneurysm, or so the doctor tells everyone. She was in good health immediately after the birth, but became hysterical when she was not allowed to see her son. The actual paternity of Am√©lia's child, while the subject of gossip, never comes to light, and Amaro moves on to another parish. The novel leaves him in Lisbon, discussing the events of the Paris Commune. Characters *Father Amaro ‚Äì Amaro was born in Lisbon to parents who worked as domestic servants for the marquise of Alegros. After being orphaned at the age of six, he was adopted by the marquise, who decided to educate him at home. He became lazy and womanish thereafter. When Amaro was 13 years old, the marquise died, and he was sent to the seminary although he didn't have a vocation. After arriving in Leiria, where he managed to get a placement, he became involved in a romantic relationship with Am√©lia, the daughter of Senhora Joanneira with whom he is living, and the two embark on a passionate love affair. *Am√©lia ‚Äì Daughter of Joanneira, she didn't know her father and was educated in a very religious environment, because her mother received a lot of visits by 'beatas', exceedingly devout members of the Church. She is betrothed to Jo√£o Eduardo, a left-wing clerk, but she falls in love with Father Amaro, becomes pregnant by him, and ultimately dies following the delivery when her child is taken from her. *Jo√£o Eduardo ‚Äì A clerk at a notary's office, he is the fianc√© of Am√©lia, hates the clergy, and only goes to the church to impress Am√©lia and her mother. When he discovers that Am√©lia and Amaro are flirting, he publishes a letter in a newspaper, A Voz do Distrito (The District's Voice), revealing their involvement as well as the other sins of the clergy. When the people of Leiria find out that Jo√£o Eduardo was the one who wrote the letter, he loses his job, is excommunicated, and Am√©lia breaks off the wedding under Amaro's instruction. *Joanneira ‚Äì She is a fat, tall woman. The mother of Am√©lia, after becoming widowed, she started being visited by a lot of members of the clergy and became the lover of Canon Dias who frequently dines there and gives her money towards housekeeping. *Canon Dias ‚Äì He was Father Amaro's religious teacher during the seminary, is the lover of Joanneira, and also the owner of a large number of rented properties. *Abbot Ferr√£o ‚Äì The only likable priest in the whole story, who represents a new form of Christian love and whose voice is said to be synonymous with that of E√ßa. He comforts Am√©lia while she is pregnant and opens the way to her redemption, although Amaro's power over her proves to be too great. He is fond of hunting. *Doctor Gouveia ‚Äì The family doctor, a liberal. *Dionisia ‚Äì A procuress and midwife who helps Father Amaro arrange the affair. *Father Nat√°rio ‚Äì A dogmatic priest who finds out that Jo√£o Eduardo is responsible for the infamous article. He is rumored to have had an affair with his two nieces. *Father Brito ‚Äì A priest who is removed to a distant mountain parish after the article makes his affair with a noble lady known. *Uncle Esguelhas ‚Äì The church bell-ringer. In his house, Father Amaro and Am√©lia can secretly meet under the guise of teaching his invalid daughter, Tot√≥, to read. *Doctor Godinho ‚Äì A prominent liberal lawyer in Leiria. Reviews Writing in the Washington Post, Michael Dirda describes O Crime do Padre Amaro as a \\"terrific novel\\". Noting that the work is often compared with Emile Zola's La Faute de l'Abb√© Mouret, Dirda argues that \\"E√ßa's relentless and unforgiving satire is far more sweeping than Zola's often soft-focused pastoral\\". He adds that the novel employs every sort of comedy and that E√ßa is a writer \\"who understands sex\\". Translations * Dutch author J. Slauerhoff translated the work into Dutch in 1932 under the title De misdaad van pater Amaro. * An English translation by Nan Flanagan appeared in 1962 under the title The Sin of Father Amaro. The novel has also been translated as The Crime of Father Amaro, published in the UK in 2003 by Dedalus Books in a new version by Margaret Jull Costa. Film and TV adaptations In 2002, Carlos Carrera directed a Spanish-language version of O Crime do Padre Amaro (El crimen del padre Amaro) in Mexico. It starred Gael Garc√≠a Bernal as Father Amaro and was greeted with public outrage in Mexico, where Christian groups called for it to be banned. In 2002, it was one of the Best Foreign Language Film Nominees at the 75th Academy Awards. The film was criticized in Portugal as insufficiently faithful to the novel. It was said that Mexico in 2002 has little or nothing to do with the 19th century context in the novel; in addition, Amaro's motivation is different. In the novel his education steers him into the priesthood, whereas in the film he chooses to follow this path himself and has some anticlerical views. Finally, E√ßa's Am√©lia is older (aged 23) than her film equivalent, although the actress who played the part (Ana Claudia Talanc√≥n) turned 22 in the year the film was released.IMDb In 2005, Carlos Coelho da Silva directed a movie O Crime do Padre Amaro in Portugal. This was a production sponsored by the SIC television channel. Padre Amaro (Jorge Corrula) and Am√©lia (Soraia Chaves) were the main characters. According to the IMDb, this was (as of January 2006) the most successful Portuguese movie in Portuguese box office history.

He played for 15 seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a shortstop, for the Washington Senators (1961‚Äì1970), Detroit Tigers (1971‚Äì1974), St. Louis Cardinals (1975), Texas Rangers (1975), and New York Yankees (1975). Brinkman led the American League in games played twice, won a Gold Glove Award at shortstop, and had a career batting average of .224. He was named to the American League All-Star team in 1973. Early life Brinkman was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. He attended Western Hills High School, where he played alongside Pete Rose on the school's baseball team. Paul \\"Pappy\\" Nohr, the baseball coach at Western Hills, described Rose as \\"a good ball player, not a Brinkman.\\" Based on their performance in high school, scouts saw Brinkman rather than Rose as the future superstar. When he was a senior, Brinkman batted .460 and also won 15 games as a pitcher including a perfect game. Brinkman was paid a large (for the time) bonus of $75,000 by the Washington Senators in 1961. Brinkman later said: \\"Pete always kidded me that the Washington Senators brought me my bonus in an armored truck. Pete said he had cashed his at the corner store.\\" Major league playing career Brinkman began the 1961 season playing for the Senators' minor league teams in Middlesboro and Pensacola before making his major league debut with the Senators on September 6, 1961, at age 19. Although Brinkman was known as a good defensive player, he seldom provided much of an offensive contribution for a Senators team that routinely finished near the bottom of the final standings. His best batting average in the first eight years of his career was a .229 average posted in 1966 when he led American League shortstops with a 3.3 defensive Wins Above Replacement (WAR). In 1969, Ted Williams was named as the Senators' manager and, he worked to improve Brinkman's hitting skills. Brinkman responded with a career-high .266 batting average as well as 71 runs scored, also a career-high. Brinkman once again led the league's shortstops with a 3.3 defensive WAR rating in 1969. He continued to improve in 1970 with a career-high 162 hits in 152 games. He also led the league's shortstops in assists and in putouts. In 1971, Brinkman was part of an eight-player trade which sent himself, third baseman Aurelio Rodr√≠guez and pitchers Joe Coleman and Jim Hannan from the Senators to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Denny McLain, Don Wert, Elliott Maddox, and Norm McRae. He had his best season defensively in 1972. Playing in all of the Tigers' 156 games, he set American League fielding records for shortstops with the most consecutive games without an error (72), most consecutive chances without an error (331), fewest errors in 150 games or more (7) and the highest fielding percentage in 150 games or more (.990). He also produced a career-high 49 runs batted in, helping the Tigers clinch the American League Eastern Division championship by a half game over the Boston Red Sox. Brinkman only appeared in one game of the 1972 American League Championship Series before he was ruled out for the rest of the season due to a ruptured disc in his lower back. The Tigers lost the championship series to the eventual world champions, the Oakland Athletics, in five games. Brinkman's efforts during the regular season earned him the 1972 Gold Glove Award and he was named the recipient of the \\"Tiger of the Year\\" award by the Detroit baseball writers. He also finished ninth in voting for the 1972 American League Most Valuable Player Award. Brinkman earned his first and only All-Star Game appearance when he was named as an American League reserve in the 1973 All-Star Game. He hit a career-high 14 home runs in the 1974 season. On November 18, 1974, the Tigers traded Brinkman to the St. Louis Cardinals. He appeared in 24 games for the Cardinals before they traded him to the Texas Rangers ‚Äî the former Senators' franchise ‚Äî on June 4, 1975. After only one appearance with the Rangers, his contract was purchased by the New York Yankees on June 13, 1975. He played in 44 games for the Yankees before they gave him his unconditional release on March 29, 1976 as, he continued to be hampered by his back injury. Brinkman played his final major league game on September 28, 1975 at the age of 33. Career statistics In a fifteen-year major league career, Brinkman played in 1,845 games, accumulating 1,355 hits in 6,045 at bats for a .224 career batting average along with 60 home runs, 461 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .280. Defensively, he recorded a .970 fielding percentage as a shortstop. Brinkman holds the American League record for the fewest hits in a season while playing a minimum of 150 games, with 82 hits in 1965. Coaching career After his playing career he was hired by the Tigers as a minor league roving fielding instructor in 1976. Brinkman then became a minor league manager in the Detroit organization, leading the 1977 Montgomery Rebels to a first-place finish in the Southern League. He spent on the Tigers' MLB coaching staff. Later, he was a coach and scout with the Chicago White Sox for 18 years (1983‚Äì2000), initially as the ChiSox' MLB infield coach (1983‚Äì1988) and then special assignment scout. He retired after the 2000 season. Ed Brinkman died on September 30, 2008 at the age of 66, due to complications from heart failure. His younger brother, Chuck Brinkman also played in Major League Baseball as a catcher. Notes * William A. Cook, \\"Pete Rose: Baseball All-Time Hit King\\" * David M.

The campaign attempted to portray the recently elected opposition leader, David Cameron, as an ever-changing populist who will be whatever people want him to be. It was criticised as being a particularly negative form of campaigning, though some have disputed this. In particular, the BBC political editor Nick Robinson said \\"you say, the public hate negative advertising. To which I say ‚Äì nonsense, poppycock and balderdash\\", adding that \\"they remember it when it's good\\". In the event, Labour had a projected national share of the vote 13% behind the Conservatives. Broadcasts A short video was first aired on British TV as a party political broadcast on behalf of the Labour Party on 18 April 2006. A sequel aired on 27 April. The episodes were also available on the campaign's website, which also included ringtones and a podcast version, until the website was closed. Message Dave the Chameleon uses the chameleon's ability to change colour to mock the Conservative Party leader. They aim to show that Cameron will 'change his colours' to fit the opinions of the people he is speaking to at a certain time. The Labour Party claim that this is a trick to hide his conservative values from others. This is part of a longer campaign to portray Cameron as an indecisive populist ‚Äì indeed, John Prescott had used the term 'Chameleon' to describe Cameron some two months previously. The broadcasts were accompanied by the song Karma Chameleon by Culture Club. In particular, the line \\"I'm a man, without conviction\\" can be heard during the broadcast. Plot =Episode 1= The first episode details the biography of Dave. A blue David the Chameleon emerges from a blue egg ‚Äì royal blue being the Conservative party's colour ‚Äì and goes to school, wearing a straw hat, an allusion to his Etonian past. Dave, like David Cameron, joins the Conservative Party during its time in power under John Major, but when Major's government begins to collapse, Dave the Chameleon 'disappears' into the background to work in public relations (again reflecting Cameron's career). According to the story, Dave the Chameleon learns a number of 'sneaky' skills in PR, making him a master of spin. He changes his name to the more informal 'Dave' and learns that, as a Chameleon, he can change his colours at will. As the narrator says: \\"And Dave the Chameleon changed into every colour of the rainbow, as he told everyone just what he 'thought' they wanted to hear. But underneath it all he was still true blue, through and through.\\" Dave the Chameleon is then shown as very blue, accompanied with a quotation from David Cameron that 'I am Conservative to the core of my being, as those who know me best will testify' (taken from an interview with the Daily Telegraph). He then turns red ‚Äì reflecting the colour of the Labour Party ‚Äì and is accompanied by the David Cameron quote that he is the 'heir to Blair'. Next Dave turns yellow ‚Äì to reflect the UK's third biggest party, the Liberal Democrats ‚Äì alongside Cameron's quote that 'I am a liberal conservative'. Dave then becomes green (and visits a solar panel shop) ‚Äì mocking David Cameron's attempts to make the Conservative Party more environmentally friendly ‚Äì before finally turning blue. The campaign's tag line is: 'Available in any colour (as long as it's blue).' =Episode 2= The second episode of Dave the Chameleon's adventures was aired on 28 April, a week before the Local Elections (4 May). The plot of this episode is largely the same as that of the previous one; repeating a number of scenes and accusations. This second episode, however, twice links Dave to Black Wednesday, seen as being the low point in John Major's reign as Prime Minister. Ironically, the press had dubbed the previous day a 'Black Wednesday' for Tony Blair, after scandals involving John Prescott, Charles Clarke and Patricia Hewitt, three British Cabinet members. It also criticises the Tory manifesto for the 2005 general election, which Dave helped write, as a \\"little blue book ... which they loved, but nobody else did.\\" The second episode also makes references to Dave's trip to a glacier in Norway, parodying Cameron's similar visit; it makes the point that for an apparently pointless trip, the harm on the environment from Dave's flight would be high. Dave is shown \\"turning into his greenest green\\" and the Conservative election slogan, \\"Vote blue, go green\\" is highlighted to indicate Dave's colour changing tendencies. Dave the Chameleon's specific colour changes are then mentioned; all of these show that he is \\"True Blue, through and through\\" and refer to apparent position changes from David Cameron. These include changes in policy on the minimum wage and the Iraq War. The narrator then refers to David Cameron directly by name (as opposed to Dave the Chameleon), saying that: \\"David Cameron will tell you whatever he thinks he want you to hear, because he knows you will never give him your vote if you see his true colours.\\" The final scene shows the Vote Labour slogan, before ending. Criticisms The campaign's critics have commented that this is just a personal attack on the Conservative Party leader, especially since the Labour party have released a ringtone which impersonates David Cameron. Others have noted that the Conservatives, with their election slogan 'vote blue, go green' have not effectively combatted this approach. The Labour party claim that the campaign is meant to be humorous and re-engage voters. By using ringtones and podcasts, they claim to be campaigning to younger generations. However other creatures appealing to younger generations used for the sale of mobile phone ringtones, most notably the Crazy Frog, have been banned from appearing on British television before the watershed. Ann Treneman, writing in The Times, said Labour had \\"plumbed new depths.\\" Other critics have noted that Tony Blair, then leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister has done a number of the things for which Cameron is criticised in the campaign; for example, critics mention that: * Anthony Charles Lynton Blair shortened his own name to \\"Tony Blair\\". * He, and much of his party, have \\"gone green\\" * Blair was educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh (sometimes called the \\"Eton of Scotland\\"), so had a fairly privileged education himself. * Blair and 'New Labour' are often credited with introducing spin to the UK as an important element of political campaigning. Commentators have also noted that the campaign was flawed to the extent that it shows Cameron in a positive light. It has been said that Conservative MPs like the Chameleon tag, as it encourages the idea that Cameron does not stick steadfastly to bad policies, and that he thus listens to what people have to say. At a reception for Conservative Fastrack in May 2006, David Cameron himself said that his two-year-old daughter described the chameleon as \\"that nice frog on the bike\\" and refers to it as \\"my favourite video\\".Hugo Rifkind, \\"People\\", The Times, 17 May 2006, p. 14 References External links * BBC elections 2006 homepage * Labour party homepage * David Cameron homepage Category:History of the Labour Party (UK) Category:History of the Conservative Party (UK) Category:2006 in the United Kingdom Category:2006 in British politics Category:Fictional chameleons and geckos Category:Cultural depictions of David Cameron ","title":"Dave the Chameleon"},{"id":"4866424","text":"Frederick Camp \\"Fritz\\" Mosher (1913 ‚Äì May 21, 1990 in Charlottesville, Virginia)The New York Times: Frederick C. Mosher; Government Expert And Teacher Was 76 was a professor of government and foreign affairs at the University of Virginia who strongly influenced a generation of scholars in public administration with his many writings, and government administrator. Mosher was an important member of the second generation of public administration scholars along with his close friend, Dwight Waldo, and others who helped define the modern structure and function of the field as taught in hundreds of PA programs around the world.  Life  Mosher was a graduate of Dartmouth College. He has a master's degree from Syracuse University. He received his doctorate (Ph. D.) in public administration from Harvard University in 1950. He taught at Syracuse University, the University of California, Berkeley, and University of Bologna, before moving to the University of Virginia's Department of Government and Foreign Affairs. He served with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Public Administration Clearing House and the Los Angeles Department of Civil Service early in his career. Mosher, a specialist in budgeting and personnel administration, served as a consultant to several Government agencies and task forces and was editor in chief of Public Administration Review (1951‚Äì1954). Mosher wrote widely on the subject of governance and public administration. He authored, coauthored, and edited books on subjects such as government staffing, presidential transitions, government agency reorganization, city services management, and the federal government's General Accounting Office (now Government Accountability Office). Mosher perhaps is best known for his book, Democracy and the Public Service, published by Oxford University Press in 1968, a work that has influenced countless civil servants in governments around the world. According to Professor Jeremy F. Plant, a 1990 poll of public administration scholars \\"ranked Democracy and the Public Service as the fifth most influential book published between 1940 and 1990\\".Jeremy F.

Mathematically, it is represented as \\\\eta = \\\\eta_c \\\\eta_p,ch10-3 where \\\\eta_c is the cycle efficiency and \\\\eta_p is the propulsive efficiency. The cycle efficiency is expressed as the percentage of the heat energy in the fuel that is converted to mechanical energy in the engine, and the propulsive efficiency is expressed as the proportion of the mechanical energy actually used to propel the aircraft. The propulsive efficiency is always less than one, because conservation of momentum requires that the exhaust have some of the kinetic energy, and the propulsive mechanism (whether propeller, jet exhaust, or ducted fan) is never perfectly efficient. It is greatly dependent on exhaust expulsion velocity and airspeed. Cycle efficiency Most aerospace vehicles are propelled by heat engines of some kind, usually an internal combustion engine. The efficiency of a heat engine relates how much useful work is output for a given amount of heat energy input. From the laws of thermodynamics: :: dW \\\\ = \\\\ dQ_c \\\\ - \\\\ (-dQ_h) :where :: dW = -PdV is the work extracted from the engine. (It is negative because work is done by the engine.) :: dQ_h = T_hdS_h is the heat energy taken from the high-temperature system (heat source). (It is negative because heat is extracted from the source, hence (-dQ_h) is positive.) :: dQ_c = T_cdS_c is the heat energy delivered to the low-temperature system (heat sink). (It is positive because heat is added to the sink.) In other words, a heat engine absorbs heat from some heat source, converting part of it to useful work, and delivering the rest to a heat sink at lower temperature. In an engine, efficiency is defined as the ratio of useful work done to energy expended. ::\\\\eta_c = \\\\frac{-dW}{-dQ_h} = \\\\frac{-dQ_h - dQ_c}{-dQ_h} = 1 - \\\\frac{dQ_c}{-dQ_h} The theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine, the Carnot efficiency, depends only on its operating temperatures. Mathematically, this is because in reversible processes, the cold reservoir would gain the same amount of entropy as that lost by the hot reservoir (i.e., dS_c = -dS_h), for no change in entropy. Thus: ::\\\\eta_\\\\text{cmax} = 1 - \\\\frac{T_cdS_c}{-T_hdS_h} = 1 - \\\\frac{T_c}{T_h} where T_h is the absolute temperature of the hot source and T_c that of the cold sink, usually measured in kelvins. Note that dS_c is positive while dS_h is negative; in any reversible work-extracting process, entropy is overall not increased, but rather is moved from a hot (high-entropy) system to a cold (low-entropy one), decreasing the entropy of the heat source and increasing that of the heat sink. Propulsive efficiency Conservation of momentum requires acceleration of propellant material in the opposite direction to accelerate a vehicle. In general, energy efficiency is highest when the exhaust velocity is low, in the frame of reference of the Earth, as this reduces loss of kinetic energy to propellant. =Jet engines= Dependence of the energy efficiency (Œ∑) from the exhaust speed/airplane speed ratio (c/v) for airbreathing jets The exact propulsive efficiency formula for air-breathing engines is K.Honicke, R.Lindner, P.Anders, M.Krahl, H.Hadrich, K.Rohricht. Beschreibung der Konstruktion der Triebwerksanlagen. Interflug, Berlin, 1968Spittle, Peter. \\"Gas turbine technology\\" p507, Rolls-Royce plc, 2003. Retrieved: 21 July 2012. :\\\\eta_p = \\\\frac{2}{1 + \\\\frac{v_9}{v_0}} where v_9 is the exhaust expulsion velocity and v_0 is the airspeed at the inlet. A corollary of this is that, particularly in air breathing engines, it is more energy efficient to accelerate a large amount of air by a small amount, than it is to accelerate a small amount of air by a large amount, even though the thrust is the same. This is why turbofan engines are more efficient than simple jet engines at subsonic speeds. Dependence of the propulsive efficiency (\\\\eta_p) upon the vehicle speed/exhaust speed ratio (v_0/v_9) for rocket and jet engines =Rocket engines= A rocket engine's \\\\eta_c is usually high due to the high combustion temperatures and pressures, and the long converging-diverging nozzle used. It varies slightly with altitude due to changing atmospheric pressure, but can be up to 70%. Most of the remainder is lost as heat in the exhaust. Rocket engines have a slightly different propulsive efficiency (\\\\eta_p) than air-breathing jet engines, as the lack of intake air changes the form of the equation. This also allows rockets to exceed their exhaust's velocity. :\\\\eta_p= \\\\frac {2 \\\\frac {v_0} {v_9}} {1 + ( \\\\frac {v_0} {v_9} )^2 }George P. Sutton & Oscar Biblarz, Rocket Propulsion Elements, pg 37-38 (seventh edition) Similarly to jet engines, matching the exhaust speed and the vehicle speed gives optimum efficiency, in theory. However, in practice, this results in a very low specific impulse, causing much greater losses due to the need for exponentially larger masses of propellant. Unlike ducted engines, rockets give thrust even when the two speeds are equal. In 1903, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky discussed the average propulsive efficiency of a rocket, which he called the utilization (utilizatsiya), the \\"portion of the total work of the explosive material transferred to the rocket\\" as opposed to the exhaust gas.\\"Study of Outer Space by Jet Drives\\", Nauchnoe Obozrenie, May 1903. =Propeller engines= Propulsive efficiency comparison for various gas turbine engine configurations The calculation is somewhat different for reciprocating and turboprop engines which rely on a propeller for propulsion since their output is typically expressed in terms of power rather than thrust. The equation for heat added per unit time, Q, can be adopted as follows: : 550 P_e = \\\\frac{\\\\eta_c H h J}{3600}, where H = calorific value of the fuel in BTU/lb, h = fuel consumption rate in lb/hr and J = mechanical equivalent of heat = 778.24 ft.lb/BTU, where P_e is engine output in horsepower, converted to foot-pounds/second by multiplication by 550. Given that specific fuel consumption is Cp = h/Pe and H = 20 052 BTU/lb for gasoline, the equation is simplified to: : \\\\eta_c (\\\\%age) = \\\\frac{12.69}{C_p}. expressed as a percentage. Assuming a typical propulsive efficiency \\\\eta_p of 86% (for the optimal airspeed and air density conditions for the given propeller design), maximum overall propulsive efficiency is estimated as: : \\\\eta = \\\\frac{10.91}{C_p}.

Early life Princess Gabriele of Leiningen, born as Gabriele Renate Homey, is the daughter of a family of successful German entrepreneurs, (n√©e Kerkhoff) and Helmut Friedhelm Homey. Early in life she adopted the surname \\"Thyssen\\" from her stepfather Bodo Thyssen (a member of the Thyssen family). After attending the Schloss Salem School on Lake Constance and the √âcole des Roches in Normandy she read jurisprudence at the Universities of Munich and Cologne. In 1990, Gabriele graduated magna cum laude with a doctorate in International Law after completing her thesis on German-American commercial law. Her early career included working, whilst still at university, in the management of her mother‚Äôs company (at the time Austria‚Äôs largest hotel and restaurant chain) and later as an associate attorney for a German law firm. Marriages and children From (L) to (R) Musa Javed Chohan, Naela Chohan, the Aga Khan, Begum Inaara Aga Khan, and Sahibzada Yaqub Khan in Paris (2002). In 1991 she married Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen in Venice, Italy. She has one child with Prince Karl Emich, a daughter: * Princess Theresa of Leiningen (born 26 April 1992) After interrupting her career prior to the birth of her daughter, Princess Gabriele became a consultant for UNESCO in Paris, advising on the promotion of equality and improved conditions for women. The marriage between Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen and Gabriele Thyssen was dissolved early in 1998. In May 1998, she married Prince Karim Aga Khan (subsequently Aga Khan IV), the 49th hereditary Imam of the Nizari branch of the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims and became the Begum Aga Khan. Prior to her marriage to the Aga Khan and her conversion to Islam, the couple jointly chose the Muslim name \\"Inaara\\" for the bride. The marriage took place at the Aga Khan's walled compound and chateau, Aiglemont, in Gouvieux, France, on May 30, 1998. She has a son: *Prince Aly Muhammad Aga Khan (born March 7, 2000). However, a little over six years after the marriage - on October 8, 2004 - an announcement was made that the Aga Khan and Begum Inaara were to seek a divorce.Princess Inaara Foundation In September 2011, a divorce settlement was reached and Begum Inaara was to receive a settlement amount of ¬£50 million. It was revealed in the court that she had hired a private detective to track the Aga Khan's movements with an air hostess. An extra-marital liaison of the Aga Khan with Beatrice von der Schulenburg, whom the Aga Khan has been close to for five years and whom it is expected the Aga Khan would marry following completion of the divorce with Begum Inaara, was also highlighted by the Begum's lawyers. However, the ¬£50 million settlement was contested by the Aga Khan in France's highest court, shortly after being announced. As a result, divorce proceedings continued while the Aga Khan was said to remain legally married to his second wife. The divorce was finalized in 2014 with the final financial settlement not revealed. In April 2016, it was announced that part of Begum Inaara's jewellery collection was to be auctioned by Christie's. Charitable activities Since 1999, Princess Gabriele of Leiningen has been supporting micro-loans and third world development projects through the German foundation Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe. The foundation funds micro-loans to families and single parents to promote self- reliance and to end the cycle of poverty in developing countries, which include Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Montenegro, Pakistan, Romania, Thailand and Vietnam. Princess Gabriele of Leiningen has committed time to charitable causes; in particular those involving women‚Äôs rights, educational projects and the improvement of opportunities and living conditions for people of all faiths and origins in developing countries. In January 2002, Begum Inaara became the honorary president of Focus Humanitarian Assistance, the crisis response agency that is an affiliate of the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) and which provides relief and support services during and following natural and man-made disasters, primarily in Asia and Africa. In this capacity, the Begum supported a number of projects for the repatriation of Afghan refugees to their homeland and rebuilding civil society in Afghanistan. In addition she continued to contribute to numerous UNESCO projects, particularly in the area of welfare for women and children, for example UNESCO's \\"Passport for Equality\\" project.http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php- URL_ID=11550&URL;_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL;_SECTION=201.html Amongst others, she accepted the patronage of the Innocence in Danger Gala event for 2003 in Berlin in order to help victims of child sexual abuse. Together with her mother and stepfather, Ernst-Theodor Henne, Gabriele founded in 2003 the German aid organization \\"SOS Projects for People and Animals\\" to help mentally-ill, handicapped and traumatized children with the support of animals, particularly dogs, to bring fun and joy into the children‚Äôs lives, and to overcome their pain and suffering. Since 2004, Princess Gabriele of Leiningen has become intensively involved in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic and supports the German AIDS Foundation.http://www.aids-stiftung.de In order to respond in a more effective way to the above-mentioned humanitarian programmes Princess Gabriele of Leiningen founded an umbrella organization, The \\"Princess Inaara Foundation\\", in 2004. The purpose of the foundation is to provide philanthropic assistance to the causes and charitable organizations whose work represents the humanitarian goals that Princess Gabriele of Leiningen has long supported. In 2009, Princess Gabriele of Leiningen became an ambassador for FIFA Football for Hope to promote a high- quality, sustainable social and humanitarian development programme, centred on football, which focuses on the fields of health promotion, peace building, children‚Äôs rights and education, anti-discrimination, social integration and the environment.https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/worldwideprograms/releases/newsid=1140923.html Awards and recognition In September, 2006, Princess Gabriele of Leiningen was awarded \\"Reminders Day\\" award for her commitment, dedication and relentless effort in the fight against HIV and AIDS.

After Hot Springs High School moved to its current location on Emory Street in 1968, this building was used as the Central Junior High until 1992. An earlier Hot Springs High School building was located at the same site on Oak Street. This structure burned in the fire of September 1913 that destroyed a large part of Hot Springs.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 26, 2006. In the episode, Homer gets fired from the nuclear power plant yet again and takes over an ice cream truck business, while a depressed Marge creates Popsicle-stick sculptures to keep busy. The sculptures quickly become popular, and Marge is excited to have a purpose in life until a turn of events divides the Simpsons household. It was written by Carolyn Omine, and directed by Matthew Nastuk. In its original run, the episode received 10.90 million viewers.Ratings Plot During a chair hockey game at the power plant with office supplies, Mr. Burns chastises Homer for behaving unprofessionally during the game. Homer gets in more trouble when an ice cream truck passes by the plant, causing him to fantasize that Mr. Burns is an ice cream cone and try to lick him, resulting in Homer being fired as he runs towards the ice cream truck. Homer uses a $100 bill to buy a 25 cent ice cream from the ice cream man, Max, who collapses and dies of a fatal heart attack while changing the bill into coins. Max's widow sells the truck to Homer, and Homer has Otto remodel it a la Pimp My Ride. Meanwhile, the television series Opal ‚Äî Springfield's version of The Oprah Winfrey Show ‚Äî has a show about successful women, which sends Marge into a deep depression, as she feels she has not done anything memorable with her life. Marge is inspired by all the Popsicle-sticks Homer brings home, and makes sculptures out of them. Kent Brockman sees the sculptures and interviews Marge, who says she creates them so they will serve as a reminder of her when she is gone. Kent includes her on a news special, Kent Brockman's Kentresting People. Thanks to the publicity, Rich Texan creates an art show to showcase Marge's talent; however, it opens on Saturday, a day with high ice cream sales. Homer promises to return by 3 o'clock to see the art show. He loses track of time and hurries home, but accidentally crashes into his own lawn in the process, destroying all of Marge's sculptures. Marge says that Homer has ruined her dreams and locks herself in the bedroom. Homer tries to express how bad he feels by slipping pictures of himself under the door but falls asleep. When he wakes up, Marge is gone and Grandpa is looking after Bart and Lisa, who tell him that Marge left hours ago. Marge is on top of city hall, where she declares she will show the world how she feels about Homer. She reveals the largest Popsicle sculpture she has ever made, and the subject is Homer. Marge realizes that Homer tried to keep his promise to her and make it on time, not that he did not care, much to the shock of a nearby Opal. Marge apologizes to Homer for the way that she acted, Homer apologizes for ruining her sculptures, and the two reunite. The scene shifts 200 years into the future, where the Homer sculpture is the only remaining element of Western art in a world where iPods have conquered humanity, whipping them with headphones for a hobby.

Lo Piccolo rose through the ranks of the Palermo mafia throughout the 1980s and he became the capomandamento of the San Lorenzo district in the early 1990s, replacing Salvatore Biondino who was sent to prison. Lo Piccolo was a fugitive since 1983 and had been running his Mafia affairs in hiding. With the capture of Bernardo Provenzano on 11 April 2006, Lo Piccolo had been cementing his power and rise to the top of the Palermo Mafia until his own arrest on 5 November 2007. It is believed that his family spread across Europe due to rising tensions, settling in England, Portugal and southern Spain. Lo Piccolo is also known as (; ). In clandestine correspondence with former mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano, Salvatore Lo Piccolo used to identify himself by the number 30. Lo Piccolo's fortune came from the international cocaine trafficking, the extortion of businesses, and the theft of money allocated for public works projects. He invested much of his earnings in real estate. Lo Piccolo long supported Provenzano's policy of not directing violence toward the state and preferred arbitration as means to settle conflict between rival mafia factions.Changes in Mafia Leadership Reveal New Links to US-Based La Cosa Nostra, DNI Open Source Center, November 19, 2007 Mafia background A photofit of Mafia boss Salvatore Lo Piccolo was constructed in February 2007, based on the mugshot at the top of the article. The photofit did not really accurately reflect the change in Lo Piccolo's appearance as became clear when he was arrested in November 2007 (see image below). Lo Piccolo was in fact betrayed because he was arrested with his son of whom police did have a recent photograph. Lo Piccolo was born in the neighbourhood Partanna Mondello in Palermo. He was the driver of the local Mafia boss Rosario Riccobono, who was killed in the Second Mafia War. Lo Piccolo changed sides and became an ally of the Corleonesi. Una \\"carriera\\" con Riina e Provenzano, La Repubblica, November 5, 2007 L'ascesa di Salvatore Lo Piccolo: da guardiaspalle a boss di Palermo, La Stampa, November 5, 2007 Bosses like Pippo Cal√≤ and Nino Rotolo pleaded to save the life of Lo Piccolo. Nearly 25 years later Rotolo would regret his appeal when a conflict arose between the two. Rotolo was overheard on bugs installed by the police saying: \\"One who should have died. He was the ‚Äògodson‚Äô of Saro Riccobono and should have gone.\\" Il boss che sfid√≤ i corleonesi, Corriere della Sera, November 6, 2007 Having survived the Second Mafia War, Lo Piccolo gradually extended his influence in the area in and around Palermo in the 1980s and 1990s. His influence in Palermo extended to Capaci, Isola delle Femmine, Carini, Villagrazia di Carini, Sferracavallo and Partanna-Mondello. According to Italian DIA (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia), Salvatore Lo Piccolo and his son, Sandro Lo Piccolo, were in charge of most of the urban territory of Palermo. Their area of influence encompassed the \\"mandamenti\\" of San Lorenzo, Passo di Rigano and Gangi, including the coastal area up to Cefal√π, and part of the territory of Messina, including the towns of Mistretta and Tortorici.Report concerning the activities conducted and the results obtained by the Direzione Investigativa Antimafia (DIA), first half of 2000 Mafia cerca il confronto con lo Stato, Sebastiano Gulisano, Polizia e democrazia, September 2001 Lo Piccolo allegedly made his fortune with drug trafficking and skimming off public contracts. He forced the residents of the low-income housing projects in the ZEN area of Palermo to pay him to keep the building corridors lit. He allegedly has strong links with the American Cosa Nostra. Cosa Nostra cerca il nuovo padrino , La Stampa, April 13, 2006 In March 2005, the Lo Piccolo clan was subject of a police operation known as the \\"Notte di San Lorenzo\\". Eighty-four arrest warrants were issued. Nonetheless, Salvatore and his son Sandro Lo Piccolo remained at large. Mafia, 84 arresti a Palermo. Sgominato il clan Lo Piccolo, Girodivite, March 9, 2005 Successor of Provenzano? After the arrest of Bernardo Provenzano on 11 April 2006, Salvatore Lo Piccolo and Matteo Messina Denaro were thought to be the new leaders of Cosa Nostra.Prosecutors fear capture of mafia boss will spark bloody war of succession, by John Hooper, The Guardian, April 13, 2006 However, the pizzini (small slips of paper used to communicate with other mafiosi to avoid phone conversations) found at Provenzano's hide-out indicated that Provenzano's joint deputies in Palermo were Salvatore Lo Piccolo and Antonio Rotolo, capo mandamento of Pagliarelli, a Corleonesi loyalist in the days of Tot√≤ Riina. In a message referring to an important decision for Cosa Nostra, Provenzano told Rotolo: \\"It's up to you, me and Lo Piccolo to decide this thing.\\"Police strike at heart of mafia averts bloody power struggle, by John Hooper, The Guardian, June 21, 2006. Anti-Mafia prosecutor Antonio Ingroia of the Direzione distrettuale antimafia (DDA) of Palermo said that it was unlikely that there would be an all-out war over who would fill Provenzano's shoes. \\"Right now I don't think that's probable,\\" he said. Of the two possible successors, Ingroia thought Lo Piccolo was the more likely heir to the Mafia throne. \\"He's from Palermo, and that's still the most powerful Mafia stronghold,\\" Ingroia said.In Sicily, the end of 'Pax Mafiosa'?, International Herald Tribune, April 13, 2006 A 'pax mafiosa' initially had settled in after Provenzano's arrest because neither Lo Piccolo nor Matteo Messina Denaro appeared to have sufficient forces to seek control of Cosa Nostra, according to the Italian news agency ANSA. Subsequent investigation revealed that Lo Piccolo and Messina Denaro had reached an accommodation and that the real threat to Lo Piccolo came from Rotolo who was arrested in June 2006. According to ANSA, \\"police were concerned by a couple of top-level hits they feared might spark a full-blown war of succession. Police said Lo Piccolo had the upper hand because he had been Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo and his greater experience won him the respect of the older generation of bosses as they pursued Provenzano's policy of keeping as low as possible while strengthening their power network. These bosses had been reined in by Provenzano when he put an end to the Riina-driven war against the state that claimed the lives of Mafia crusaders Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.\\" Clash with other mafiosi The ensuing power struggle, following Provenzano's arrest, led not only to increased violence in Sicily but also to likely renewed cooperation between the Sicilian mafia and the US-based Gambino crime family. Their growing relationship may open new possibilities for the Sicilian Mafia to launder money through US institutions. On 20 June 2006, two months after Provenzano's arrest, authorities issued 52 arrest warrants against the top echelon of Cosa Nostra in the city of Palermo (Operation Gotha). Among the arrestees were Antonio Rotolo and his right-hand men Antonino Cin√† (who had been the personal physician of Salvatore Riina and Provenzano) and the builder Francesco Bonura, as well as Gerlando Alberti, the ageing pioneer of heroin refineries. The investigations showed that Rotolo had built a kind of federation within the Mafia, comprising 13 families grouped in four clans. The city of Palermo was ruled by this triumvirate replacing the Palermo's Mafia Commission whose members are all in jail. The investigation also indicated that the position of Salvatore Lo Piccolo was not undisputed. A clash between Lo Piccolo and Rotolo had been developing over a request from the Inzerillo family to be allowed to return to Palermo. The Inzerillo family had been one of the clans whose leaders ‚Äì among them Salvatore Inzerillo ‚Äì were killed by the Corleonesi during the second Mafia War in the 1980s and which had been in exile in the United States. Rotolo had been part of the Mafia clans that had attacked the Inzerillo clan. He was opposed to Lo Piccolo's permission for the return of the Inzerillo's, fearing revenge.\\"Pizzini\\" Notes Reveal New Mafia Bosses, by Felice Cavallaro, Corriere delle Sera, June 21, 2006 Lo Piccolo, l'erede di Provenzano. Cos√¨ sta conquistando Palermo, Corriere della Sera, June 30, 2007 With the arrest of Rotolo and others, authorities claim they avoided the outbreak of a genuine war inside Cosa Nostra. Rotolo had passed a death sentence on Lo Piccolo and his son, Sandro, even before Provenzano's arrest ‚Äì and had procured the barrels of acid that are used to dissolve the bodies of slain rivals. According to some observers, the arrest of the loyal Corleonesi triumvirate Rotolo, Cin√† and Bonura, has given Lo Piccolo a free rein in Palermo. Rising tensions In August 2006, two hitmen gunned down 63-year-old Giuseppe D'Angelo in broad daylight in the Palermo district of Tommaso Natale. The crime may have been a provocation by a rival mafia faction against Lo Piccolo and concerns about a renewal of violence between competing mafia groups were mounting. In September 2006, Bartolomeo Spatola, the 72-year-old boss of the Sferracavallo district of Palermo, disappeared. The press suggested Salvatore Lo Piccolo's men kidnapped and killed Spatola because he had allegedly supported Nino Rotolo's plan to murder Lo Piccolo and his son Sandro. In March 2007, police discovered a large arsenal of weapons in the countryside outside Palermo. The weapons \\"were ready to be used\\" and opined that the current absence of violence in Palermo \\"did not signify that the danger of a new mafia war had been averted.\\" On 13 June 2007, two hitmen killed 46-year-old mafia boss Nicola Ingarao ‚Äì an ally of Nino Rotolo. la guerra tra cosche ucciso il boss di Porta Nuova , La Repubblica (Palermo edition), June 14, 2007 Italy's domestic intelligence service SISDE, warned that the murder of Ingarao possibly marked a return to Mafia violence. An Antimafia prosecutor seconded this view stating that the murder \\"could be a sign of reorganization, stabilization, or potential war among gangs.\\" Lo Piccolo allegedly ordered Ingarao's murder for two reasons: 1) Ingarao opposed the return of the Inzerillo family; and 2) the elimination of Ingarao would enable Lo Piccolo to secure control of the central Palermo district of Porta Nuova for factions not hostile to him. Gaspare Pulizzi, one of Lo Piccolo's right-hand men who later became a pentito, revealed that Lo Piccolo's son Sandro was behind the murders of Spatola and Ingarao. Both murdered bosses allied with Rotolo. Mafia, si pente Gaspare Pulizzi colonnello del boss Lo Piccolo, La Repubblica, January 22, 2008 In a July 2007, hearing before the Italian Senate, the director of Italian State Police, Antonio Manganelli, warned that the chain of recent murders in Palermo was in part due to the return of the \\"so-called fugitives (Inzerillo family)... who have now returned... If they are back, it means that someone has authorized their return. This is not appreciated by the other side,\\" he added. Arrest On 5 November 2007, Lo Piccolo and his son Sandro, as well as two other top mafiosi, Gaspare Pulizzi and Andrea Adamo, were arrested in a villa in Giardinello, between Cinisi and Terrasini. Mafia, arrestato Salvatore Lo Piccolo, La Repubblica, November 5, 2007Italy arrests senior mafia boss, BBC News, November 5, 2007 Police fired several warning shots in the air as they moved in against the mafiosi, who were all armed but apparently did not put up a fight. Sandro Lo Piccolo, in tears, shouted \\"I love you dad!\\" several times as he was being handcuffed. The four were put into a police helicopter and flown towards Palermo's main police station. The operation was made possible by information provided by Francesco Franzese, who was arrested on 2 August 2007, who masterminded the Lo Piccolo clan's protection racket. His family has been moved to a secret hideout to prevent reprisals.'Boss of bosses' successor arrested at mafia summit, The Guardian, November 6, 2007Mafia head arrested, Ansa, November 5, 2007 Officers remarked that Lo Piccolo's face was entirely different from the photofit creation.Sicilian Mafia's boss of bosses arrested, Daily Telegraph, November 7, 2007 Lo Piccolo did not say a word and just smiled when prosecutors noted that he did not resemble the photofit released earlier this year.

The so- called \\"Ten Commandments\\" include prohibitions such as frequenting bars and looking at friends' wives, while members are urged to treat their own wives with respect. The Mafia Decalogue has been drawn up as a \\"guide to being a good mafioso\\".

The main reason for the update to the form was the standardization of names in SEVIS. The changes include: * More prominence to the SEVIS number. * Better separation of student information from dependent information. * Expandable field boxes that display information about cap gap extension, change of status, event history and other authorizations. * General design improvements that include moving the instructions to the third page of the Form I-20, as well as the removal of the barcode, and the blocks for visa and port of entry information. * The new Request Mass Reprint functionality that allows DSOs to reprint Forms I-20 for multiple students at a time.

Overall role  = SEVP-certified institution = The Form I-20 is issued by a Designated School Official (DSO) at the institution (college, university, or vocational school). Only institutions that are SEVP-certified can issue Form I-20s. An institution can acquire SEVP certification by filing Form I-17 with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (this is a one-time process). Note that an institution can be SEVP-certified despite not holding national or regional accreditation. Conversely, an institution may hold national or regional accreditation but may have chosen not to obtain SEVP certification if it does not intend to admit international students in the F, J, or M status. A large university typically has an international office that manages its participation in the SEVP, and all the DSOs work for this office. The international office manages updates to the SEVIS record and issuing of new paper Form I-20s. Students who have any change to their plans (such as program end date, course load, leave of absence, return from leave of absence) must communicate these changes with their international office. = Student SEVIS record and Form I-20 = At the time the first Form I-20 is issued to the student (after accepting the offer of admission from the institution) a record is created for the student in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). At any given time, the responsibility for keeping the student's SEVIS record up to date falls with the SEVP-certified institution the student is currently enrolled in. If the student transfers to a different SEVP-certified institution, the responsibility of updating the SEVIS record now falls on the new institution. The Form I-20 can be thought of as a paper representation of the most up-to-date SEVIS information on record for the student's current enrollment. Whenever there are substantive changes to the information, the SEVIS record is updated, and a new Form I-20 is issued to the student by the institution with the updated information. The student must use the most up-to-date Form I-20 when demonstrating student status.  Process  = Issuance of first Form I-20 = Once the prospective student has accepted the institution's offer of admission, the institution issues a Form I-20 to the student. Apart from biographical information about the student (including the student's name, date of birth, citizenship, etc.), there are two main pieces of information that must be entered in the student's SEVIS record and the initial Form I-20. * Program details: The program name, start date, and end date. * How the student intends to meet tuition and living expenses for the first year the student is in the program, or until the end date indicated on the I-20, whichever is shorter. Each international office may follow its own rules or guidelines regarding the type of documentation it requests from the student or from other departments in order to be able to issue the I-20. The jargon used for this documentation will also vary by institution. For instance, the University of Chicago and University of Michigan uses the term \\"Financial Resources Statement\\" for the statement that students need to submit to it regarding how they will meet their expenses, while the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign uses the term \\"Declaration & Certification of Finances for I-20/DS-2019 Application\\". After receiving information from the student and institution regarding the program length and end date, the international office creates the student's SEVIS record, gets a SEVIS number for the student, and issues a Form I-20. A physical copy of the form may be mailed to the student overseas. In the case that the student has a SEVIS record from previous student status, the existing SEVIS record should be transferred. The international office may refuse to issue a Form I-20 if the student is unable to demonstrate how he or she plans to cover expenses for the first year. = Use of Form I-20 while transitioning to student status = The Form I-20 is used in the following stages of the transition to student status in the United States: * The SEVIS number on the I-20 is needed while paying the SEVIS fee. * It is needed when applying for the F visa or M visa, both when filling the application form and during the interview. * It is needed when seeking admission to the United States. At the time of admission, a valid visa as well as a valid I-20 are needed. At the time of initial entry, the officer at the port of entry checks that the program start date is at most 30 days ahead, and that the I-20 has a valid travel signature. It is also necessary that, at the time of initial entry, the school the student intends to attend matches the school on the student's visa and the student's I-20, though this is not a requirement in the future. The officer at the port of entry also issues a Form I-94 with expiration date indicated as \\"D/S\\" (Duration of Status), which means that the student is in authorized status in the United States until the program end date indicated on the I-20 (and can stay in the United States for up to 60 days after that). * For those who are not seeking admission to the United States but simply changing status, a copy of the Form I-20 needs to be attached along with the Form I-539 application to change status. For those entering the United States in student status, the date of entry to the United States is treated as the start date for the student being in the F or M student status (even if this is before the program start date). For those transitioning to student status from another status, the date of transition indicated on the Form I-539 is treated as the start date.  Subsequent use of Form I-20  = Establishing legality of status and stay = The Form I-20 serves as evidence of the legality of the student's current presence in the United States. Note that a valid visa is not necessary for being in lawful student status; a valid visa is only needed when entering or re-entering the United States. = Documentation of student status for United States government purposes = The Form I-20 may be used to demonstrate student status when applying for United States government documents and benefits such as Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) and Social Security Number. It is also required to demonstrate authorization to work for students on Curricular Practical Training. = Travel and travel signatures = Whenever the student re-enters the United States after traveling, the student must have all of these at the time of arrival at the port of entry: * A valid passport (valid for at least six more months) * A valid F or M visa * A valid I-20 (i.e., an I-20 whose program end date has not yet arrived) * A travel signature on the I-20 (page 3) from the DSO that is at most one year old (six months in the case of students currently on post-completion Optional Practical Training) Since travel signatures are valid for only a year, students need to periodically get updated travel signatures on their I-20 from their international student office. The purpose of this requirement is to avoid cases where people who are no longer enrolled as students at an institution keep using an outdated Form I-20 to get in. In particular, when adding a new travel signature to the OPT, it is the responsibility of the international student office to make sure that the student is still enrolled at the institution. In case the Form I-20 runs out of space for travel signatures, the international office may print out a new Form I-20 for the student. In the special case of automatic visa revalidation, whereby the student returns to the United States after a trip to Canada, Mexico, or a nearby island for at most 30 days, it is not necessary to have a valid visa at the time of re-entry. However, it is still necessary to have a valid Form I-20 and a travel signature.  Changes to Form I-20  In general, whenever there are changes to the information in Form I-20, a new Form I-20 is issued. The student is advised to keep all historical Forms I-20 for the record but only the most recent copy should be used for travel or as proof of current student status. =Changing the program end date = It may happen that the student's actual program end date falls earlier or later than what the student expected. It is necessary that a new I-20 be issued reflecting the current program end date, both prior to the program's actual end and prior to the stated program end date on the Form I-20. If the Form I-20 is being shortened, the international office may require the student to submit evidence showing that the student has enough academic credits to graduate early. If the Form I-20 is being extended, then, in addition to any evidence from the student about changed academic plans, the international office also needs an updated statement of financial resources for the new I-20 to cover up to one year of the I-20 extension. After the change to the program end date is made in the student's SEVIS record, the new Form I-20 is issued to the student. It is important to note that the program end date on the Form I-20 need not coincide with the graduation date. Rather, it is the end date of the student's enrollment in courses. It is not possible to extend the program end date simply in order to be able to stay around till the graduation ceremony. If the graduation ceremony falls outside the 60-day grace period of completion of coursework, then the student must find some other way to be legally present for it (for instance, by staying around on Optional Practical Training, or getting a B visa for the graduation ceremony). = Other changes = The following are some other types of major updates to the student's SEVIS record that require changes to the Form I-20. In all cases, the student must contact the international office beforehand and have a new I-20 issued in advance: * Reduced Course Load: This means that the student is not enrolled as a full- time student. Reasons for granting RCL include final quarter/semester, medical condition, and academic difficulties. Academic difficulties in turn include improper course level placement, academic difficulties with the English language, or unfamiliarity with American teaching methods. * Practical Training, including Optional Practical Training (pre-completion and post- completion) and Curricular Practical Training * Leave of Absence and Withdrawal See also *College admissions in the United States *F-1 visa *J-1 visa *M-1 visa References Category:United States Department of Homeland Security Category:United States government forms ","title":"I-20 (form)"},{"id":"4866481","text":"Spin Chemistry is a sub-field of chemistry and physics, positioned at the intersection of chemical kinetics, photochemistry, magnetic resonance and free radical chemistry, and dealing with magnetic and spin effects in chemical reactions. The examples of phenomena that Spin Chemistry deals with are Chemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear and Electron Polarization (CIDNP and CIDEP), magnetic isotope effects in chemical reactions, as well as the environmental, health effects of static and oscillating electromagnetic fields, and avian magnetoreception, particularly as radical-pair reaction kinetics are dependent on the direction of magnetic fields.  The Radical- Pair Mechanism  The radical-pair mechanism explains how a magnetic field can affect reaction kinetics by affecting electron spin dynamics. Most commonly demonstrated in reactions of organic compounds involving radical intermediates, a magnetic field can speed up a reaction by decreasing the frequency of reverse reactions. = History of the Theory and Circumstances of Proposal = The radical-pair mechanism emerged as an explanation to CIDNP and CIDEP and was proposed in 1969 by Closs; Kaptein and Oosterhoff. = Radicals and Radical-Pairs = thumbExample radical: Structure of Hydrocarboxyl radical, lone electron indicated as single black dot 145x145px A radical is a molecule with an odd number of electrons, and is induced in a variety of ways, including ultra-violet radiation. A sun burn is largely due to radical formation from this radiation. The radical-pair, however, is not simply two radicals. This is because radical-pairs (specifically singlets) are quantum entangled, even as separate molecules. More fundamental to the radical-pair mechanism, however, is the fact that radical-pair electrons both have spin, short for spin angular momentum, which gives each separate radical a magnetic moment. Therefore, spin states can be altered by magnetic fields. = Singlet versus Triplet Spin States = The radical-pair is characterized as triplet or singlet by the spin state of the two lone electrons, paired together. The spin relationship is such that the two unpaired electrons, one in each radical molecule, may have opposite spin (singlet; anticorrelated), or the same spin (triplet; correlated). The singlet state is called such because there is only one way for the electrons‚Äô spins to anticorrelate (S), whereas the triplet state is called such because the electron‚Äôs spin may be correlated in three different fashions (T+1, T0,T‚àí1). Simple diagram of bonding between electrons with opposite spin = Relevance to Reaction Kinetics and the Zeeman Interaction = Spin states relate to chemical and biochemical reaction mechanisms because bonds can be formed only between two electrons of opposite spin (Hund‚Äôs Rule). Sometimes when a bond is broken in a particular manner, for example, when struck by photons, each electron in the bond relocates to each respective molecule, and a radical-pair is formed. Furthermore, the spin of each electron previously involved in the bond is conserved, which means that the radical-pair now formed is a singlet (each electron has opposite spin, as in the origin bond). As such, the reverse reaction, i.e. the reforming of a bond, called recombination, readily occurs. The radical-pair mechanism explains how external magnetic fields can prevent radical-pair recombination with Zeeman interactions, the interaction between spin and an external magnetic field, and shows how a higher occurrence of the triplet state accelerates radical reactions because triplets can proceed only to products, and singlets are in equilibrium with the reactants as well as with the products. Zeeman interactions can ‚Äúflip‚Äù only one of the radical‚Äôs electron‚Äôs spin if the radical-pair is anisotropic, thereby converting singlet radical-pairs to triplets.367x367pxThe Zeeman interaction is an interaction between spin and external magnetic field, and is given by the equation, ‚àÜE=hvL=g¬µBB where ‚àÜE is the energy of the Zeeman interaction, in Joules, vL is the Larmor frequency, in hertz, B is the external magnetic field, in teslas, ¬µB is the Bohr magneton constant, h is Planck‚Äôs constant, and g is the g-value of a free electron, 2.002319, which is slightly different in different radicals. It is common to see the Zeeman Interaction formulated in other ways. = Hyperfine Interactions = Hyperfine interactions, the internal magnetic fields of local magnetic isotopes, play a significant role as well in the spin dynamics of radical-pairs. = Zeeman Interactions and Magnetoreception = Because the Zeeman Interaction is a function of magnetic field and Larmor frequency, it can be obstructed or amplified by altering the external magnetic or the Larmor frequency with experimental instruments that generate oscillating fields. This is interesting because migratory birds lose their navigational abilities in similar conditions where the Zeeman interaction is obstructed in radical-pairs, and researchers can control these conditions to probe the importance of Zeeman Interactions in Magnetoreception, implicating the presence of a radical-pair mechanism.

He finished 12th (of 50) in his event,Olympic results and was considered a possible medal threat at the Montreal Games of 1976. Tsobari was the sole survivor of the six athletes housed in Apartment 3 at 31 Connollystra√üe, which was the second apartment taken by Arab terrorists in the early morning hours of 5 September 1972 in an event called the Munich massacre. Although he was originally taken hostage by the Black September terrorists, Tsobari was able to escape with the help of his already-wounded coach, Moshe Weinberg, who attacked the terrorists and received fatal gunshot wounds in the process. As Tsobari and his fellow Israelis were herded in single file, down the stairs to the ground floor, a terrorist wearing a balaclava at the foot of the stairs, gestured with his weapon the direction Tsobari was to go. At that moment, Tsobari pushed the terrorist's weapon aside and dashed down a flight of steps into the underground car park, pursued by a terrorist who shot two or three rounds at the fleeing Tsobari but missed. Tsobari carried on sprinting for seventy metres until he came to the Olympic Village fence which he jumped over and ran into the nearby Olympic press center. He was ignored for the first few seconds until taking a journalist aside and calmly explaining what had happened and who he was. After being escorted under police guard, Tsobari found a woman that spoke Hebrew and German. Over the next five hours he sketched on maps what had happened, how he had escaped, what kind of people, how many people were injured and how many terrorists. Nearly 18 hours later, Tsobari and the rest of the Israeli Olympians not taken hostage watched the helicopters take off for F√ºrstenfeldbruck airbase, where the remaining Israeli athletes taken hostage would be shot dead by the Palestinian terrorists, five of whom themselves were shot dead by German police snipers on 6 September.

The temple is located in the village, surrounded by mountains and canals. The temple was known originally as Irumpudayaan Kandan Sasthan kovil. The current temple complex was built in 1981 and the first Amman Kudai Vizha (annual celebration of the Devi) was conducted on 9 November 1981 (24th Aippasi 1157 of Tamil Calendar). The Nakshatra on this day was Revatƒ´. Thereafter, every year, celebrations are conducted on the month of Aippasi on the day of Revatƒ´ nakshatra. There are three main buildings in the temple: the renovated Nagaramman temple, the Amman Temple (built in 1981), and Shiva Maadan Temple (built later), which houses the deity Boothathan. The Temple complex consists of the main campus, which houses the main deities, and the surrounding area. These areas also hold bases for some deities, a spring (ootrukuzhi) where fresh water flows year round, the temple pond, rocks and trees. The pond is also known as irumpudayaan kulam. Legend tells that iron was melted and poured into this pond. The temple is currently maintained by the Elur Chetty community. History Although the exact origins of the temple are not known, it is believed the temple was worshipped for more than 8000 years. The Nagaramman (The Snake Goddess) temple and the centre lamp post are the only structures remaining from the original temple. There are broken remains of baked mud statues around the temple. These remains tell us that the temple was worshipped by many devotees during those days. During the early days of the complex, the entire area was covered with wild bushes and trees. Devotees had to make way through the bushes to reach the temple. The Nagaramman temple itself was fully covered with bushes. Later, the complex was cleared of these bushes.  Location  The Temple is situated in the area of Perumchilampu, in Velimalai village, Kalkulam taluka in Kanyakumari district of South Tamil Nadu. It is situated near Padmanabhapuram town and Nagercoil city, the administrative headquarters of the area.

Its annual conference is an important meeting for those interested in bureaucracy, civic engagement, program evaluation, public management and other public administration topics, such as budgeting and budget theory, government strategic planning, policy analysis, contract administration, personnel management, and related topics. American Society for Public Administration was founded in 1939, following growing concerns about the management of federal government and the report of the Brownlow Committee. It was formally incorporated on September 13, 1945.\\"American Society for Public Administration\\". Corporation File Detail Report. Illinois Secretary of State. Accessed on April 6, 2016. American Society for Public Administration owns the journals Public Administration Review and Public Integrity and sponsors several others via its subject-matter Sections, including Journal of Health and Human Services Administration, Public Budgeting and Finance, and others. History American Society for Public Administration was founded in 1939 by Louis Brownlow, William E. Mosher, Donald C. Stone, Charles A. Beard, Harold D. Smith, Luther Gulick, and others. During its early years, American Society for Public Administration was housed in the Public Administration Clearing House (PACH) in Chicago. Significant events in American Society for Public Administration's history include: * Sponsorship of Public Administration Review since 1939. * After a developmental grant from the Ford Foundation in 1956, independence from PACH. * A move of the headquarters to Washington, D.C., in 1964. * Establishment of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) as part of ASPA in 1967, and formal separation of NAPA from ASPA in 1970. * Reformulation of ASPA's Council on Graduate Education for Public Administration to the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA) within ASPA in 1970, and formal separation of NASPAA from ASPA in 1975. * In 1981, creation with NAPA of National Public Service Awards. * A 50th Anniversary Conference in 1990. * Approval of the American Society for Public Administration Code of Ethics in 1994. American Society for Public Administration's membership declined from about 14,000 members in 1990 to 8,383 members in 2007. However, during that period the Society took \\"steps to address its most serious issues: attracting and retaining members, dealing with structure and funding, developing a coherent mission, strengthening chapters and sections, sponsoring successful conferences, enhancing its publication offerings, and working effectively with other organizations concerned with public administration and public service.\\" American Society for Public Administration membership was affected by the tendency of government to hire local governmental personnel, and the change from government provision of services to contracting to the private and non-profit sectors. However, the field of public administration is the sole academic field given the responsibility for areas ranging from government budgeting at the United States budget levels, community development throughout all localities and states in the United States, and personnel management of all United States workforces, among others.  Programs  ASPA Annual Conference is a yearly conference held to connect administrators and scholars from across the globe to share experiences and information with one another. There are a series of guest panelists and presentations that are presented during this event. The Founders' Fellows Program was launched in the early 2000s; it was created for early young professionals entering the field of public service. The program contains a series of developmental webinars, mentorships and other events they must attend. The fellows present their research from this event at the Annual Conference and submit a paper that is related to their area of expertise, which will then be published in the online PA TIMES. It was originally open to graduate students, but the fellowship program has since then expanded to include new administrators entering the field. In 2015, the program had a change in content and now the fellows compete in year-long mentoring and webinar sessions.

It uses alternate reality-style gameplay, in which the player receives emails from other in-game characters, including the game's main antagonist. The player needs to find information and clues to the games' puzzles on the Internet, both from real websites, and from specially-created websites that have been mixed in with other \\"real-world\\" domains. According to director Eric Viennot, the game was a commercial success, with sales above 300,000 units worldwide by late 2006. Plot The game centers around the disappearance of journalist Jack Lorski, and his young female companion, Karen Gijman, in Europe while investigating a series of bizarre murders. Some weeks later, the agency they work for receives a package containing a CD-ROM. On this CD-ROM is a mixture of disturbing footage and reports made by Jack, but also some other data including puzzles and messages, created by someone referring to themselves only as \\"The Phoenix.\\" The agency then decides to release the CD-ROM to the public in the hope of finding out what happened to Jack and Karen. This is where the player comes in. In 1975, a beach goer accidentally witnesses the murder of Peter Volker, a German professor of epigraphy. Years later, Jack Lorski randomly purchases the video camera with the film still inside. He tracks down Karen, the daughter of the cameraman who went missing the same year, presumably in connection to the murder. The two decide to track down the killers. It turns out a group called Manus Domini, a solar cult, murdered Volker to prevent him from releasing the \\"cursed codex\\" of the Nag Hammadi. The Phoenix in turn, is murdering the members of Manus Domini, in order to fulfill the initiation ritual of Giordano Bruno, whom he claims to be the reincarnation of. After realizing he is being tracked by Karen and Jack, he kidnaps them both in order to bring attention to the murders, and reveal the existence of Manus Domini. Upon completing the primary games, the player is given the opportunity to play a game with the Phoenix for Karen's and Jack's life. Regardless of the outcome, a member of SKL, the paper investigating Jack's disappearance, hacks the Phoenix's site and locates Jack and Karen, who are found and rescued. Development In Memoriam was developed by Lexis Num√©rique and directed by Eric Viennot. This group had previously created the successful Uncle Albert's Adventures game series for children, whose three entries had reached combined sales above 500,000 units. In Memoriam cost ‚Ç¨1 million to develop, a budget that Lexis Num√©rique paid by itself. The game took four years to create. Reception =Sales= In Memoriam was a commercial success. The game sold 15,000 units in its initial 15 days of release in Europe, which the French newspaper Lib√©ration described as a favorable sign. To combat software piracy in the European market, the game retailed at a price of ‚Ç¨30, as Lexis Num√©rique believed that a lower price would encourage purchases rather than theft. However, piracy remained a problem in Europe. Just Adventure's Randy Sluganski reported that In Memoriam had reached 85,000 registered users by the time its European sales hit 35,000 units, and that certain registrants were based in countries where the game was not available for purchase. In Memoriam nevertheless became profitable and \\"a hit\\" for Lexis in Europe by mid-2004, according to Sluganski, but profits lost to piracy slowed the developer's growth. The game reached 100,000 registered players by September 2004, following its release in the United States.https://web.archive.org/web/20051017160723/http://www.afjv.com/press0409/040927_in_memoriam.htm In December 2006, Eric Viennot announced that In Memoriams sales had reached 300,000 units worldwide. Of this number, France accounted for 30,000 units and the United States for 80,000. Viennot noted that the game's audience was 40% female, and that 50% of players were below the age of 25. =Critical reviews= The review aggregation website Metacritic reported its critical reception as \\"generally positive\\". The editors of Computer Gaming World named In Memoriam their 2004 \\"Adventure Game of the Year\\". They wrote, \\"Missing: Since January isn't just Majestic done right, it's Majestic done.\\" In 2011, Adventure Gamers named In Memoriam the 56th-best adventure game ever released. Expansion and sequel An expansion, titled The 13th Victim, was produced and released in late 2005.

Classic theorists in Public Budgeting include Henry Adams, William F. Willoughby, V. O. Key, Jr., and, more recently, Aaron Wildavsky. Notable recent theorists include Baumgartner and Jones--Frank R. Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones, Richard Fenno, Allen Schick, Dennis Ippolito, Naomi Caiden, Irene Rubin, James D. Savage, Thomas Greitens and Gary Wamsley. Budget theory was a central topic during the Progressive Era and was much discussed in municipal bureaus and other academic and quasi- academic facilities of that time such as the nascent Brookings Institution. The executive budget in United States was a financial innovation designed to empower city mayors and city managers with the capacity to implement needed policy reforms in the Progressive Era. Since that time, the executive budget has become a tool by which the president of the United States has been able to substantively shape policy and draw power to the president from Congress, which was originally charged with \\"holding the purse\\" (and still is constitutionally, as there is no federal-legislative authority to change the constitution outside the amendment process or for congress to legislate away their authority). This has resulted in an ever increasing role and power base for what is now called the Office of Management and Budget. Budget, Civil society and Constitutional economics Constitutional economics is a field of economics and constitutionalism which describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy including budget process. The standards of constitutional economics when used during annual budget planning, as well as the latter's transparency to the society, are of the primary guiding importance to the implementation of the rule of law. Also, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society. The term ‚Äúconstitutional economics‚Äù was used by American economist ‚Äì James M. Buchanan ‚Äì as a name for a new academic sub-discipline that in 1986 brought him the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his ‚Äúdevelopment of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision- making.‚Äù Buchanan rejects ‚Äúany organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members.‚Äù This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. Buchanan believes that a constitution, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions and to balance interests of the state and society against those of individuals and their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1986/buchanan.html The Russian school of constitutional economics was created in the early 21st century with the idea that CE allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis in the legislative, first of all, budget process, thus helping to overcome arbitrariness in the economic and financial decision- making and to open entrance to civil society into budget process. This model of CE is based on the understanding that it is necessary to narrow the gap between practical enforcement of the economic, social and political rights granted by the constitution and the annual (or mid-term) economic policy, budget legislation and administrative policies conducted by the government. In 2006, the Russian Academy of Sciences has officially recognized constitutional economics as a separate academic sub-discipline.Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova, The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform, edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007 Constitutional economics studies such issues as the proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary, which in many transitional and developing countries is completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the principle of powers' ‚Äúchecks and balances‚Äù, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and various privileges ‚Äì being the most dangerous), and the private. The state corruption of the judiciary makes it almost impossible for any business to optimally facilitate the growth and development of national market economy.Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009 See also * public budgeting * budget deficit * budget surplus * budget crisis * Canadian federal budget * Comprehensive income * Constitutional economics * Corporate finance * Crony capitalism * Form 10-K * Federal Accountability Act (Canada) * Government Accountability Office * Government Accountability Office investigations of the Department of Defense * Government-owned corporation * public administration * public finance * United States budget process * Civil society Notes  References  *Henry C.

Mahina is located on the island of Tahiti, in the administrative subdivision of the Windward Islands, themselves part of the Society Islands. Mahina is the 5th most populous commune in French Polynesia with a population of 14,764 (2017 census),Recensement 2017 in an area of 52 km2.Communes of French Polynesia, statoids.com Mount Orohena is a nearby mountain.  History  The area of Mahina was first settled by early Polynesians from Asia. Canoes out of tree trunks were used to transport to Tahiti. The Polynesians had built houses out of grass on the beach and lived off of Fish and Bananas. They had hunted fish with spears and rocks. They had also picked up bananas from the land high above mean sea level. Captain James Cook had arrived on his expedition to chart Pacific Islands. He later sailed off to nearby Moorea and a few years later, he sailed to New Zealand and Australia. Charles Darwin had later come to Tahiti on his expedition. Don the Beachcomber had lived in Tahiti until his house was destroyed by a cyclone. Later on, the Faaa International Airport in Faaa was built in 1962. Many people from Mahina had used the airport. In 2007, Air Moorea crashed when it went to Moorea.  Transportation  Tahiti's west coast freeway ends in nearby Arue and small roads lead to the ending of the freeway. Other small roads lead in other directions. Most of the roads in Mahina are paved, while some are dirt and lead to the nearby mountains of Tahiti.  Geography  Point Venus is marked in this annotated Landsat image Mahina is on the northern coast of Tahiti about 9 meters above mean sea level. The commune of Arue is located to the west of Mahina. Mount Orohena is the tallest mountain in French Polynesia at 7,300 feet. Point Venus is a nearby lighthouse on the coast and people are able to view Moorea. Papenoo is a nearby comune that is home of the mouth of the Papenoo River.  Education  The University of French Polynesia is the only university in all of French Polynesia. Students from many other islands come to this university. The University of French Polynesia is a relatively small university with around 2,000 students. High schools are found throughout Tahiti. Some students in Mahina take classes in other countries such as the United States or New Zealand.  Economy  Many supermarkets are found throughout Mahina and mainly sell fruits such as bananas and apples. Banana trees grow in the mountains and delivery trucks bring the fruit down to Mahina's main supermarket. Mahina's supermarket has a larger variety of goods. The large Papeete supermarket in Papeete is nearby in the busy town center. Faaa has a big mall with clothing stores and Tahitian restaurants with a view of the Pacific Ocean. Mahina has a few industrial valleys that are home to factories. Some hardware stores such as Polybuild, Polymat, and Polywood are found in these valleys.  Safety  Mahina is close to the Faaa International Airport which has a few military planes. There are tests each day when they fly around Tahiti and other islands. In the airport terminal, Security guards check the passengers bag if they had brought along weapons of any kind. Police cars patrol the streets of Mahina to see if any drivers are speeding.

Z. Sakall, and Betta St. John. The film is an adaptation of the 1924 operetta of the same name composed by Sigmund Romberg with lyrics by Dorothy Donnelly, with the screenplay by Sonya Levien and William Ludwig. Based on the stage play Old Heidelberg by Wilhelm Meyer-F√∂rster (itself an adaptation of his obscure 1898 novel Karl Heinrich), the film is about a brash young prince of a small German kingdom, who must choose between his romance with a barmaid and his impending royal duties. It was filmed and released in CinemaScope and Ansco Color. The film gained some infamy during production when original star Mario Lanza left the project before principal photography, necessitating his last-minute replacement by the lesser-known Purdom. Due to the contractual agreement between studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lanza, songs that the actor had already recorded were used in the film, dubbing over Purdom's actual voice. Plot Young Prince Karl, of a small kingdom within the German Empire, is sent off near the turn of the 20th century to get a university education in the university city of Heidelberg. His grandfather was one of a handful of petty kings within German-speaking central Europe. Fictional Karlsburg is small, but fiercely proud of its history and traditions. Karl has been raised most of his life for the military, but when it comes time for him to marry, the princess picked for him cannot stand his stiff formality. This would not be such a problem but for the fact that Karlsburg has no great wealth, only good breeding. His tutor recommends that he be sent to a university to develop an easier, more sociable manner. He (eventually) slips into the social mix, becomes accepted as a \\"good chap\\" by his student peers, and falls deeply in love with Kathie, a pretty, popular, and musically inclined barmaid, who holds \\"court\\" in the local biergarten. Love notwithstanding, when his old grandfather dies unexpectedly, the young prince must marry the princess and take his place in the small kingdom that he is destined to rule. He returns for one last time to Heidelberg to bid Kathie a poignant farewell. Cast * Ann Blyth as Kathie Ruder * Edmund Purdom as Prince Karl ** Mario Lanza as Karl's singing voice * John Ericson as Count Von Asterburg * Louis Calhern as King Ferdinand of Karlsburg * Edmund Gwenn as Prof. Juttner * S.Z. Sakall as Joseph Ruder (credited as S.Z. \\"Cuddles\\" Sakall) * Betta St. John as Princess Johanna * John Williams as Lutz * Evelyn Varden as Queen * John Hoyt as Prime Minister * Richard Anderson as Lucas * Roger Allen as Von Fischtenstein * Steve Rowland as Feuerwald * Chris Warfield as Richter * Gilbert Legay as Von Buhler * Archer MacDonald as Head Corps Servant * Charles Davis as Hubert * John Qualen as Willie Klauber Production The film featured, as the credits read, \\"the singing voice of Mario Lanza\\". Lanza had originally been cast as Prince Karl, but the singer was fired from the picture (some sources state that Lanza voluntarily walked off the film). Under the terms of the eventual settlement between MGM and Lanza, the studio retained the rights to use the songs for the film's soundtrack that Lanza had already recorded. The songs (including \\"Beloved\\" ‚Äì written specially for the movie ‚Äì and the well-remembered \\"Serenade\\", from the original show) would become some of those most identified with Lanza, even though they were mouthed in the film by Edmund Purdom, who took over the role of Prince Karl. Ann Blyth co-starred as Kathie. Blyth had played opposite Lanza in the 1951 blockbuster The Great Caruso. The film also featured Louis Calhern, John Ericson, Edmund Gwenn, S.Z. Sakall, Betta St. John, John Williams, Evelyn Varden and John Hoyt. The picture was directed by Richard Thorpe (who replaced the original director, Curtis Bernhardt) and produced by Joe Pasternak. The screenplay was by Sonya Levien and William Ludwig and was based on the operetta The Student Prince by Sigmund Romberg and Dorothy Donnelly which was in turn based on the 1901 play Old Heidelberg by Wilhelm Meyer-F√∂rster. New scenes and rewritten dialogue not found in the stage production were also added, although the basic plot remained the same. Additional songs were specially written by Nicholas Brodszky and Paul Francis Webster. Many of Ms. Donnelly's original stage lyrics were completely changed for the film. Owing to the story's popularity it has been turned into films on numerous occasions, including the American silent film Old Heidelberg (1915), the German silent film Old Heidelberg (1923), Ernst Lubitsch's The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg (1927), and Ernst Marischka's Old Heidelberg (1959). Reception The film was a big hit - according to MGM records it made $2,528,000 in the US and Canada and $2,813,000 in other countries, resulting in a profit of $451,000. Soundtrack RCA Victor issued two different recordings with Lanza of the songs from the film. The first, in 1954, was a genuine film soundtrack recording in monophonic sound. Rather than reissuing the original soundtrack in stereophonic sound (which would have been possible since the movie was filmed using 4-track stereo, and stereo records were released starting in 1958), RCA Victor recorded and released an all-new album in 1959. The original Dorothy Donnelly lyrics were restored to this album. Both the 1954 and 1959 albums, however, also included the three additional songs written specially for the film version (\\"Summertime in Heidelberg\\", \\"I'll Walk With God\\", and \\"Beloved\\"), and both albums omit the solo for Kathie, \\"Come Boys\\".

It was formed following the merger between the Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Masal) when their respective fronts Samyukta Janamorcha Nepal and the Rashtriya Jana Morcha joined together on July 10, 2002.http://www.nepalnews.com.np/archive/2002/july/arc427.htm A Central Committee of Janamorcha Nepal was constituted, with 46 members (23 from each of the merged fronts). At the time of its foundation, JMN had six Members of Parliament: *Lila Mani Pokhrel *Hari Acharya *Chitra Bahadur KC *Pari Thapa *Navraj Subedi *Dilaram Acharya During the Loktantra Andolan uprising of 2006 Janamorcha Nepal joined the Seven Party Alliance. After the defeat of the regime of King Gyanendra, Janamorcha Nepal was divided. As of December 2006, there were three separate organizations calling themselves Janamorcha Nepal. One group was led by Amik Sherchan, one was led by Chitra Bahadur KC and a third was led by Chitra Bahadur Ale. Each of the three factions had parliamentary representation. Chitra Bahadur KC's group counted with himself, Dilaram Acharya and Hari Acharya. Pari Thapa and Navraj Subedi sided with Chitra Bahadur Ale. Amik Sherchan's sole follower amongst the original RJM/SJM MPs was Lila Mani Pohkrel, but the group got three more nominated members as the interim legislature was formed (Asarphi Sada, Anjana Bisankhe, and Kaman Singh Lama). The Sherchan-led JMN retained the membership in the ruling Eight Party Alliance, and when the interim government was formed Giriraj Mani Pokharel and Shashi Shrestha of the JMN(Sherchan) were appointed as Minister and Minister of State of Health respectively. The Amik Sherchan-group was able to register themselves with the Election Commission as 'Janamorcha Nepal'. The Chitra Bahadur KC-group changed the name to Rashtriya Jana Morcha whereas the Chitra Bahadur Ale-group joined the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified). In August 2008, Sherchan was deposed as chairman of Janamorcha Nepal and suspended for three months, after having urged support for Ram Baran Yadav in the presidential vote. Lila Mani Pokhrel was appointed acting chairman by the Central Committee of Janamorcha Nepal. In October 2008, the Janamorcha Nepal led by Amik Sherchan merged with CPN(Maoist). Then, Amik Sherchan, Lilamani Pokhrel, and Giriraj Mani Pokharel were inducted in the Standing Committee of the Party.

It is a sequel to drama series Sunehrey Din (Golden Days) with some of the different cast. The series ran on PTV from May till July 1998. The last shooting was completed at PMA Kakul on 4 December 1997. The drama was produced by PTV Lahore centre and Shoman Productions. The events in the drama involve romance and comedy, while reflecting the Pakistan Army's operational involvement in the Bosnian War and Siachen conflict.  Story  The drama is based on the life and times of three characters ‚Äî Faraz, Kashif, and Gulsher also known as Alpha Bravo Charlie. The drama starts when the three friends have just passed out from PMA (Pakistan Military Academy) and enter the army as officers. Faraz enters first, and he comes in with his brand new Mercedes car which his father (a very rich landlord) gifted him for winning the sword of honour. He is bashed for this, and he is even fooled by the batman, who happens to be the Major. The day after, Kashif comes in as well and he is also fooled by the batman. But Kashif already knew because of his father who was a General in the army. A couple of days later, Gulsher joins as well. The three slowly get settled down into the army. In the 2nd episode, when Gulsher takes the seat of the Adjutant, he gets 2 calls from the same girl who is claiming that the call mistakenly goes to this number, and she is trying to reach another number. Gulsher tries to flirt with her and says if you want to talk to me, just be honest. The girl didn't like this at all and tells him that she is the daughter of the General in the Army, and he will have to pray a price for this. Gulsher is very scared. He is told that the General will be meeting him at 8PM at the park. He goes there, stands there for 4 hours and eventually returns. This happens for 6 days back-to-back. In the first holidays, Faraz goes for a jog in the jogging park and sees a girl. He stops jogging, and turns around. The girl tells Faraz that she noticed what he has done. Faraz is very suprised about the facts that the girl is so bold and not shy at all. He is also very impressed, and starts liking her a little bit. The girl also told Faraz her name. Her name is Shahnaz. Faraz and Kashif are sent to Mona Depot, to get a horse-riding course. At a nearby mansion, Faraz sees the same girl. Kashif is talking to the man that is with her (her adoptive father) and Faraz asks him how he knows them. Kashif tells him that they are his family friend. Back to Gulsher, the girl calls for him again, and he insists to meet her so he can apologise. They meet, and it is revealed that the girl that Gulsher had been talking to on the phone, is the same girl that Faraz is in love with: Shahnaz. Shahnaz take Gulsher to a restaurant because she realises that Gulsher is a decent guy, and he didn't mean to flirt with her. But Gulsher can't afford the food and it will hurt his pride if he lets a girl pay for his food, so he runs away from the restaurant. The next morning Shahnaz calls for Gulsher again, but he is too afraid to talk to her so tells the adjutant to make an excuse. The same night, Gulsher receives a letter in which is written that he needs to be at a certain place on a certain time. He goes here, and Shahnaz appears, very angry. She was angry that he made an excuse and that the adjutant must be thinking wrong about her. She also tells Gulsher to be more confident, and not so shy. Faraz, Kashif and Gulsher are now going to be sent to another exercise. Before going, Kashif tells his father to go to Shahnaz's house and ask for her hand in marriage. At the exercise, Kashif is playing games with the tank for which he is punished. Eventually, he tells the Major he wants to leave the army because he thinks he is a mis-fit and he was forced to join the army anyways. But the major has other plans. Back from the exercise, Faraz gets to know from his dad that Shahnaz refused the proposal. When Faraz confronts Shahnaz, she tells him that he is Mr.Perfect, which is why she refused him. She will have pretty much no impact on his life whatsoever, because he will achieve whatever he wants to, and she wants someone who does lack things, and has flaws, so she can fix those flaws. As a joke, Faraz says: I think i have someone in mind for you, he is our Mr. Charlie. He says Gulsher. Although he meant it as a joke, Shahnaz thought it was a very good idea and tells him to talk to Gulsher about this. Gulsher and Shahnaz get married. Kashif is being sent to Siachin, and he tries his best to stop this. He takes the wives of high officers on shopping, and talks to his father who is a general. He says: i will not survive in any way. Or the enemy will kill me, or i will die of cold. But nothing works out. He goes to Siachin. Shortly after this, Gulsher gets sent to Bosnia. Kashif and Gulsher both experience a lot of adventures in their spot. When situation gets tense at Siachin, the officers are making a plan to reach the peak to have control over the area and be prior to the enemy. Kashif comes out with an outstanding plan, and also volunteers for the mission. He and one other man get sent to the peak, but they still have to climb. While climbing, Kashif's partner gets shot. He doesn't die, but he weakens a lot. Kashif shoots the enemies. The both now go ahead to reach the top. Kashifs partner reaches the top first, and he is almost passed out when Kashif reaches. But still he tells Kashif to proceed and let him be. Kashif moves further, and then a group of enemies come. Kashif shoots them all, and then comes back to check on this partner. He also tries to reach out to the headquarters, but nothing works. The next scene is at the Hospital, where the parents of Kashif are informed that their son has survived and that it is a miracle, but he has had an awful frost bite and both his arms and both legs are cut off. In the very same scene, we see Gulsher and Shahnaz's son being born. his name is Sher Jaan. In Bosnia, a very big conflict breaks out. Gulsher goes out with a tanks and a couple of other men. Gulsher goes away from the tanks, where he is surrounded by Serbs. The tank explodes, and the army is informed that Gulsher has martyred. Shahnaz is told the same. But in reality, Gulsher is caught by Serbs who want him to state lies, so they have proof against the Muslims. But Gulsher doesn't do this. In Pakistan, Shahnaz slowly get's over Gulsher's death. Her son is growing up. Kashif gets artificials Arms and Legs, and proceed to serve the army. He is promoted to Major, from Captain. Faraz and Shahnaz start getting very close to each other. They open a hostel for special children. Faraz's father tells him to marry Shahnaz. Even Shahnaz's Uncle and Aunt think that Shahnaz likes Faraz. In the last episode, Shahnaz tells Faraz that she wants to marry Kashif. But Kashif refuses. When Shahnaz is convincing Kashif, her Uncle gets a phone call that Gulsher is alive. They are all very happy. In Bosnia, Gulsher finally escapes from the camp he was locked up in. While escaping, he is chased by a couple of men, and shot dead. Flash forward to 20 years later. Faraz is now Brigadier and lives with 2 daughters and his wife. Kashif is Colonel and lives with a son, a daughter and his wife. After the war in Bosnia, Shahnaz went to Bosnia in search of Gulsher. She couldn't find him. The end. Cast and characters =Main= * Faraz Inam as Captain / Brigadier General Faraz Ahmed: A captain in the army and son of a rich landlord in Punjab.

A Spanish mercenary army surprised a band of rebels and killed or captured almost all of them. Background Beginning in 1566, Protestant mobs in the provincial states of the Netherlands began destroying Catholic art and images to protest lack of legally mandated ponies under the rule of Philip II of Spain, sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands. In March 1567, under the leadership of a young nobleman, Jean Marnix, rebels gathered and built a fortified compound at Oosterweel, approximately one mile from Antwerp. Battle Attempting to deal with the gathering of the rebels, Margaret of Parma, the Spanish Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, employed a mercenary army to confront the rebels. The army was provided in large part by the loyalist Count Egmont and led by Philip de Lannoy, Seigneur De Beauvoir, who served as the commander of the Governor's bodyguards. On 12 March the Spanish mercenary army prepared for the battle in secret. The troop of eight hundred men was split into small groups and quietly placed for deployment. Helmets, bucklers, arquebuses, corselets, spears, standards, and drums were distributed silently. Before daybreak on 13 March the soldiers were advised that they would advance on the rebels with banners furled and no drumbeat. Once the enemy was in sight, the soldiers were told that they should fire upon the rebels in volleys. When the battle started, the rebels were caught completely by surprise. Although Jean Marnix exhibited bravery, most of the rebels were panic-stricken and shot wildly. The Spanish mercenaries easily broke into the rebel encampment, killing hundreds of the rebels and causing hundreds more to flee. The killing, however, continued as the Spanish mercenaries hunted down and shot the fleeing rebels. Jean Marnix was killed and sliced to pieces. Hardly any rebels escaped and those that were taken as prisoners were eventually executed. In the nearby city of Antwerp, William the Silent, the Burggraaf of the city, attempted to block those Protestants of Antwerp that desired to go to the aid of the rebels as he said that he was bound by oath to support Philip II. Those citizens that defied the Burggraaf to go to the aid of the rebels quickly retreated for the most part when they saw the dominance and ferocity of the Spanish mercenaries. Aftermath The slaughter caused Calvinists to immediately cease the open defiance of Spanish authority. Calvinist worship all throughout the Netherlands was affected, and many dissidents including William the Silent fled to other countries. In literature The battle and its aftermath are depicted in Cecelia Holland's novel The Sea Beggars - seen through the eyes of an idealistic young Calvinist from Antwerp who tries to join the rebels but arrives too late.

The Centris 610 was introduced alongside the larger Centris 650 as the replacement for the Macintosh IIsi, and it was intended as the start of the new midrange Centris line of computers. Later in 1993, Apple decided to follow an emerging industry trend of naming product families for their target customers Quadra for business, LC for education, and Performa for home and folded the Centris 610 into the Quadra family. The 610 is the second Macintosh case design (after the Macintosh LC family) to use a pizza box form factor; it was later used for the Centris / Quadra 660AV and the Power Macintosh 6100. The Quadra 610 was also sold in a \\"DOS compatible\\" model with an additional 486SX processor at 25 MHz on a Processor Direct Slot card. A server variant, the Workgroup Server 60, was introduced in July 1993 with a 20 MHz processor, which received the same 25 MHz upgrade in October. A \\"DOS Compatible\\" version was introduced in February 1994 as a way for Apple to judge whether the market would be interested in a Macintosh that could also run DOS. The product was deemed by Apple a success, selling all 25,000 units that were produced in two months. The Quadra 610 was replaced with the Quadra 630 in July 1994, and the Workgroup Server 6150 replaced the Workgroup Server 60 as Apple's entry-level server offering.  Hardware  Standard equipment on all Centris 610 models includes onboard video (with VGA support via an adapter), two ADB and two serial ports, and an external SCSI connector. There are two SIMM slots that support 4, 8, 16, and 32 MB SIMMs, allowing for a 68 MB of RAM. Ethernet-capable models have an AAUI port. There are no NuBus slots; an optional expansion card was offered that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot and allows a single 7-inch NuBus card to be installed in a horizontal orientation. This arrangement initially precluded the use of the full 68040 processor as there was insufficient clearance for a heat sink, something the 68LC040 does not require. This was no longer an issue by the time the Quadra 610 DOS Compatible was released, which included a full 68040 CPU. When the Centris 610 was first introduced, only a few 7-inch NuBus cards existed; most were 12 inches. The smaller size was part of an upcoming update to the NuBus standard. System 7.1 was included as standard, with Mac OS 8.1 being the highest supported version. Versions with a full 68040 can also run A/UX with the appropriate Enablers.  Models  Introduced February 10, 1993: * Macintosh Centris 610: Sold in four configurations: ** 68LC040, 4 MB RAM (onboard), 512 KB VRAM (onboard), 80 MB HDD, no Ethernet ** 68LC040, 8 MB RAM (4 MB onboard + 4 MB SIMM), 512 KB VRAM (onboard), 80 MB HDD, Ethernet ** 68LC040, 8 MB RAM (4 MB onboard + 4 MB SIMM), 512 KB VRAM (onboard), 230 MB HDD, Ethernet ** 68LC040, 8 MB RAM (4 MB onboard + 4 MB SIMM), 1 MB VRAM (512 KB onboard + 512 KB SIMM), 230 MB HDD, Ethernet, AppleCD 300i and microphone Introduced July 26, 1993: * Workgroup Server 60: 68040 at 40 MHz, 8 MB ram (onboard), 250 or 500 MB HDD. The 500 MB model was sold for US$2,699 as of early 1994. Introduced October 21, 1993: * Macintosh Quadra 610: 68LC040 or 68040 at 25 MHz, 160 or 230 MB HDD. Introduced February 28, 1994: * Macintosh Quadra 610 DOS Compatible: 68040 at 25 MHz, 160 or 230 MB HDD; the DOS card occupies the PDS slot and includes an Intel 486SX-25 and has a 72-pin SIMM slot which supports up to 32 MB RAM.

The river is part of the Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta and is mostly fed by the river Rhine. At first, a disconnected branch of the Meuse joins the Waal at Woudrichem to form the Boven Merwede (Upper Merwede). A few kilometers downstream it splits into the Beneden Merwede (Lower Merwede) on the right and the Nieuwe Merwede (New Merwede) on the left. All these rivers are tidal. The Nieuwe Merwede joins the Bergse Maas near Lage Zwaluwe to form the Hollands Diep estuary, and separates the Island of Dordrecht from the Biesbosch National Park. The Beneden Merwede splits into the Noord River and Oude Maas near Papendrecht. History In medieval times the name Merwede (or \\"Merwe\\" in Middle Dutch) was the name of a continuous stretch of river, considered to be the lower part of the river Waal (a major distributary branch of the Rhine), and carried on its name all the way to the sea. Later on, the name Merwede was discarded downstream of the town of Papendrecht and replaced with Noord river and, even further downstream, Nieuwe Maas. Only the part of the river between Woudrichem en Papendrecht retained its name. The confusing river names are the result of two major flood events, which both resulted in a significant shift in the course and flow of the lower rivers. The first of these events forced the river Meuse (Maas) to take a more northerly course and created a direct connection between the Meuse and the Merwede at the town of Woudrichem. The names of several stretches of the lower rivers were then changed to reflect this, for example the Oude Maas and Nieuwe Maas. During a second flooding event (the St. Elizabeth floods) a major breach in the coastal dunes of Holland created an inlet that would eventually reach the Merwede, thus creating a new, more southerly and shorter path to the sea. Most of the flow of the river Meuse, and a considerable part of the flow of the Rhine (by means of the Waal), were rerouted to this new pathway (the current Biesbosch, Hollands Diep and Haringvliet). From that time on, the Oude Maas and Nieuwe Maas received little water from the Meuse. In recent centuries the influence of the Meuse has decreased even further, to the point that the major stretches of river called Oude Maas and Nieuwe Maas have been essentially cut off from the river Meuse completely. Both the current Merwede and all of its lower stretches (now called Noord river, Oude Maas and Nieuwe Maas) are now consequently almost exclusively fed by the Rhine, while the Meuse has been given its own artificial mouth, Bergse Maas, and the two rivers Rhine and Meuse are now mostly separated to reduce the risk of flooding. This separation of the rivers Rhine and Maas is considered to be the greatest achievement in Dutch hydraulic engineering before the completion of the Zuiderzee Works and Delta Works. The Merovingian dynasty probably derived its name from this river.

KMIK would also change its call letters to KHEP. Gabrielle consummated the purchase on October 20, 2015. On October 15, 2015, KMIK signed off the air to allow for a transmitter relocation. While off the air, Gabrielle Broadcasting asked the FCC to change its call letters to KHEP, which were the longtime call letters of 1280 from 1956 until 1999. AM 1280 is now known as KXEG. Gabrielle began work on downgrading 1580 from a Class B to a Class D station, along with a tower relocation and a major nighttime power decrease from 50,000 watts directional to 95 watts non-directional, diplexed with KXEG west of central Phoenix. In November 2016, it was announced that KHEP was sold by Gabrielle Broadcasting to CRC Broadcasting Company, Inc., owners of business news KFNN, with the sale closing on May 1, 2017 at a price of $450,000. CRC owner Ron Cohen tapped Mike Muraco, who had been hosting a brokered sports talk show on crosstown KDUS (which he would later return to on a brokered-time basis in 2019) to develop a brand new sports station. On February 14, 2017, KQFN filed an application for a Federal Communications Commission construction permit to increase night power to 700 watts. The application was accepted for filing on February 17, 2017. The station returned to the air on February 13, 2017, under a local marketing agreement with CRC, airing an all-sports format. On March 16, 2017, following the closing of the station's sale to CRC, KHEP changed their call letters to KQFN. =K257CD translator history= K257CD is one of Phoenix's oldest translators, having rebroadcast a number of different stations since going on air in 1984. It initially provided a simulcast of KSTM in Apache Junction, but by the mid-90s it was dependent on KRIM which itself was one of several transmitters for KBZR/KPTY. After a stint simulcasting KNRJ, it most recently served as a translator for KFNN prior to being transitioned to KQFN; at that time, KFNN built a new translator on 105.3 MHz.

Quiller, whose one-word name is a pseudonym,Schickel, Richard (27 January 1967). \\"The Most Dour Spy of Them All: The Quiller Caper\\". Life. \\"Under the pseudonym of Adam Hall, he created Quiller, the monomial secret-agent hero of The Quiller Memorandum ...\\" works as a spy, and he is the hero of a series of 19 Cold War thrillers written under the pseudonym Adam Hall, and became Trevor's most popular character. The books focus on a solitary, highly capable operative who works, usually on his own, for a British government organization, referred to as \\"The Bureau\\", which \\"doesn't exist\\". Quiller narrates his adventures in first person, addressing the reader in an informal tone. He was named for the real-life Cornish writer Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. Characterisation Quiller is a highly skilled driver, pilot, diver, linguist and martial artist. In his choice of self-defence methods, he favours Shotokan karate, much like Trevor himself. Additionally, Quiller has knowledge of Chin Na‚Äîa related, complementary art focused on advanced joint manipulation. He does not carry a firearm \\"in peacetime\\". Indeed, this may mean that he has not carried one since World War II, reasoning that if he were caught, he would be able to explain anything he was carrying except a gun. He also believes that guns give their carriers a dangerously false sense of security, and dislikes the noise they make. His resistance to interrogation is exceptional and he has managed to keep the \\"suffix-nine\\" designation indicating he is \\"reliable under torture\\". He has a morbid dislike of dogs, especially guard dogs.Hall, Adam (pseud). The Striker Portfolio. Fontana 1975, p. 114 During times of extreme stress, he develops a nervous tic in his left eyelid.Hall, Adam (pseud). The Quiller Memorandum, Pyramid, 1966, p. 176 Quiller's narration of the tradecraft he routinely employs is one of the defining elements of the novels. There are detailed descriptions of \\"shadowing,\\" the art of following targets and evading surveillance. Certain other common factors appear. First, he is almost always reluctant to take on a mission and he regularly tells the reader all Bureau operatives have an option to refuse. Manipulation to get him to agree to the mission is usually necessary.Hall, Adam (pseud). The 9th Directive. Fontana, 1975, p. 10 Second, there is nearly always an explosion somewhere in the novel. Third, at least one car chase can be expected, with Quiller as pursuer or pursued. Fourth, in contrast to the glamorous lifestyles depicted in the James Bond canon, Quiller's operational locations are almost always unfriendly (Warsaw in winter, the Sahara Desert under the blazing sun, etc.) and he is aware his expenses will be scrutinised minutely. Most of the books feature an extended, detailed scene of hand-to-hand combat. His missions are organised under the control of a director in the field, and a control operating from the bureau in London. A number of these characters recur in the books; some are heartily disliked by Quiller, and he comments on how much he doesn't want to work with them.

It is located in a 1970s industrial building in Marzahn-Hellersdorf district of Berlin. Built for the ORWO company which produced photographic film, by 1990 the building was owned by the property company TLG (Treuhandliegenschaftsgesellschaft), and was mostly empty, with some floors used by other companies for storage. From 1998 it was increasingly used by bands for rehearsal space, thanks to its isolation in an industrial estate. In June 2004 the lack of statutory fire protection meant that the owners had to close the building. By that time approximately 400 musicians had found a place for rehearsals, and had extensively adapted and furnished their rooms. By use of protests and the occasional occupation they generated publicity for the project, and gained support from the press and local politicians. Berlin senator Thomas Flierl negotiated with the TLG and achieved an agreement. A non-profit association \\"ORWOhaus\\" was created that gained financial support from the National Lottery, and recognition from the \\"Germany - Land of Ideas\\" initiative. On 30 April 2005, the ORWOhaus association signed a sales contract, which was confirmed at the end of May 2006. Repairs to bring the building up-to-date were begun and in July 2006 a music festival mounted. In mid-2007 -- after two years of campaigning by ORWOhaus musicians to have the street's name changed -- their street (Street 13) was renamed \\"Frank-Zappa-Stra√üe\\" after American composer and musician Frank Zappa. Sheik Yerbouti -- a Frank Zappa cover band; Napoleon Murphy Brock; and sixteen other bands celebrated the renaming with an all-night concert. More than 2,800 people attended the concert, which was held on the final weekend of July, 2007. As the reason for their efforts to rename the street, a spokesperson for the ORWOhaus association is quoted by the AP as saying: \\"...he was without taboo, musically versatile, provocative, and didn't allow himself to be captured by capitalistic enterprises.\\". Facilities The ORWOhaus is a unique facility for musicians and artists in Berlin. It offers meeting places, studios, and music services in approximately 2500sq.m. of space, open around the clock. In addition there are booking agents, companies providing event management and promotion, graphic and web design, equipment rental and artist management. On the ground floor concerts and workshops can be organized. A caf√© with a roof terrace is planned in which musicians can meet, exchange ideas and make contacts.

It was broadcast on ITV2 and on TV3 in the Republic of Ireland, on Saturday and Sunday nights after the main ITV show from 4 September 2004 to 11 December 2016. It featured behind-the-scenes footage of The X Factor and shows the emotional responses of the contestants after the judges comment on their performances. Background and overview The commissioning of The Xtra Factor was prompted by the success of Big Brother's Little Brother, a former Big Brother companion show screened on E4. The Xtra Factor featured extra auditions, bootcamp performances and judges' houses performances and behind-the-scenes footage. There were sometimes competitions and games featuring the judges and presenters. During the live shows the programme featured behind-the-scenes footage and answered live video and phone calls for the judges and contestants. Facebook statuses and tweets were read out as well. It also showed the emotional responses of the contestants after the judges comment on their performances. A celebrity panel was usually featured, who gave their opinions on the contestants. Voiceovers from series 1‚Äì6 were done by Peter Dickson, and by Brian Blessed in series 7. Dickson returned in series 8 and continued his role until the show ended after series 13. Redd Pepper only featured in one episode ‚Äì series 12‚Äôs judges houses. Broadcast The Xtra Factor usually aired on ITV2 directly after the ITV broadcast of The X Factor. Therefore, from series 1 to 5, The Xtra Factor aired once a week. From Series 6, with the introduction of the Sunday results show, The Xtra Factor aired twice a week, during weeks that there were two episodes of The X Factor. In series 12, initially The Xtra Factor aired directly after every show (Saturday and Sunday for the first four weeks during the auditions, then every Sunday for the next five weeks during bootcamp and the six-chair challenge, before returning to both Saturday and Sundays, live for judges' houses). From the live shows, the Saturday episode was replaced by a live episode on Thursdays for the remainder of the series, starting on 29 October 2015. For series 13, it reverted to airing directly after each ITV broadcast of The X Factor, though the episode after the live performance shows was 30 minutes long instead of an hour. Up to the live shows, episodes of The Xtra Factor were pre-recorded, and during the live shows, they were broadcast live from the Fountain Studios, however, for series 13, The Xtra Factor became The Xtra Factor Live which aired live from The Hospital Club after every pre-recorded X Factor show. The live editions after the live shows were still filmed at the Fountain Studios On 18 January 2017, it was announced that The Xtra Factor would be axed after 13 years and would be replaced by an online show instead. Presenters Until series 3, The Xtra Factor was hosted by Ben Shephard. Shephard did not return for series 4, and Fearne Cotton took over as presenter, for series 4 only, before leaving the show to concentrate on her career in America. Allegations of a falling-out with Cowell were also reported.\\"TV Holly Willoughby's nice F-earner\\", News of the World For series 5, Cotton was replaced by presenter and close friend Holly Willoughby. Willoughby first presented The Xtra Factor on 9 August 2008, a week before series 5 was broadcast. Konnie Huq replaced Willoughby as the new Xtra Factor presenter for series 7. However, Huq decided to depart from the series in March 2011 because of work commitments. On 31 May 2011, Caroline Flack and Olly Murs were confirmed as the new co-presenters for series 8 by The X Factor official Twitter page. Both Flack and Murs returned in 2012, however, due to touring in America with One Direction, Murs only presented the live shows though he did recorded interviews with the contestants earlier in the series, while guest presenters such as Jedward and Westlife helped Flack with the audition stages. In April 2013, it was confirmed that Murs would not be returning for series 10 as he wished to concentrate on his own music career. Comedian Matt Richardson was later announced to replace Murs. On 4 June 2014, it was announced that Richardson would not return as co-presenter for series 11. Flack confirmed on 11 June 2014 that she would not be returning to present the 11th series of The Xtra Factor. The next day, it was confirmed that Sarah- Jane Crawford would replace Flack and Richardson as presenter. On 11 May 2015, Crawford confirmed via Twitter that she would not return for a second series in 2015. On 18 June 2015, it was confirmed that The Saturdays singer Rochelle Humes and Kiss FM DJ Melvin Odoom would be the hosts. On 27 June 2016, it was confirmed that Matt Edmondson would be the host of The Xtra Factor. It was confirmed on 1 July 2016 that Rylan Clark-Neal would co-host alongside Edmondson. The same day, it was announced that Roman Kemp would join the show as the new digital online presenter and social media reporter. Spin-offs and specials Cameras follow the finalists during their day, and in early series some of the footage was aired in a spin-off show called The Xtra Factor: The Aftermath, which was broadcast in the middle of the week on ITV2. The Xtra Factor: Xcess All Areas was a live show in which there were interviews, games and trips around the contestants' homes. The show also let viewers know which songs the contestants would be singing in the next live show. Both shows were axed after series 3 due to ITV2 cutting back on spin-off programing. For the series 12 live shows, both formats were revived under a single Thursday night live edition of The Xtra Factor as a replacement for the Saturday edition. Until Series 10, after the series has come to an end, The Xtra Factor has a week of special programmes titled Best and Worst, featuring the best and worst auditions from the previous series, ranging from one to five episodes each year. A 60-minute special titled The Winner's Story is broadcast each year over the festive period, featuring the winner of that year's X Factor. Cameras follow the winner from the announcement of the result through the lead-up to the Christmas number one. As from 2010, one week before each series due to start, there features a special called X Factor Rewind looking back at the previous year's contestants and what happened to them during The X Factor and what has happened to them since the show ended. In Series 12, these programmes aired in late afternoon slots on weekends. They started two weeks before the show began, and finished the day the show started, for the first time on ITV. In 2016, the same format was used, but with only 2 episodes, and airing on ITV2.

The book contains eight chapters and numerous illustrations. Though the book was one of Potter's last publications in 1930, it was one of the first stories she wrote.  Overview  Potter introduces the story as her explanation of how the pig from Edward Lear's poem, \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\" comes to travel to the \\"land where the Bong-Tree grows\\". Little Pig Robinson's aunts, Miss Porcas and Miss Dorcas, send him to the market to sell produce from their farm and purchase certain items they need. On his way home from the market, Little Pig Robinson is stopped by a sailor who offers him an array of goods and an opportunity to travel. Little Pig Robinson agrees to the sailor's offer and goes with the sailor to the ship. There, the sailor tells Little Pig Robinson to go down and help himself to \\"muffins and crumpets\\". The sailors then leave the dock and Little Pig Robinson quickly realizes he has been kidnapped. He further realizes that the sailor he had met at the market was in truth the ship's cook who had planned to turn Little Pig Robinson into a fine feast for the ship's men. With the help of the ship's resident cat, Little Pig Robinson escapes in a rowing boat and finds his way to \\"the land where the Bong tree grows\\". Some time later Pig Robinson meets the Owl and the Pussycat there. Composition history Potter began writing The Tale of Little Pig Robinson in 1893 after a holiday to Falmouth and other coastal towns, in particular Hastings where she gained inspiration from the landscape. Pig Robinson was written as a prequel to Edward Lear's poem \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\", which Potter would illustrate in 1897. Potter also used elements of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and her own stories about her pet pigs. While writing The Tale of Little Pig Robinson, Potter drew some of her first drawings in her journal, including character sketches and literary portraits. The book was initially rejected by the publisher Frederick Warne & Co. due to its length and lack of illustrations‚Äîa result of the story's division into chapters. The story was first published in September 1930 in Britain by Frederick Warne & Co. and in America by David McKay Publications after both companies encouraged her to release a new book in 1929. After receiving the request, Potter revised the manuscript and illustrations for the publication, but her story faced delays due to Potter having a case of bronchitis. When the book was finally published, it was much more popular in Britain than America and required several reprints to meet demand. Potter took the income from the sales of The Tale of Little Pig Robinson to purchase the Monk Conniston Estate as an investment. Critical response The Tale of Little Pig Robinson has been called a conventional narrative when compared to some of Potter's latter literary efforts lacking the concentrated intensity of her other writing. Due to the book being illustrated after Potter wrote it, the story has been criticized for being unnecessarily long. The elements of social criticism in the text have been seen to contrast against the humorous nature of the book. Adaptations A 1990 British television movie adaptation of The Tale of Little Pig Robinson was produced by Dreamscape Company.

Rod the roadie, is a modern-day hobo. He dosses in squats and never settles anywhere for long, although he does return to Albert Square several times. Rod is a sucker for female hopeless cases and he tries to help out several 'women in need' over the years, although he is rarely thanked for his efforts. Storylines  Rod is first seen in Albert Square in July 1987 as an acquaintance of fellow punk, Mary Smith (Linda Davidson). Rod is a greasy layabout, but underneath his scruffy appearance lies a kind-hearted, genuine guy, who will go out of his way to help anyone in need. Mary becomes the first lady who Rod takes under his wing. Mary is going through a hard time around the time of his arrival. She has been arrested for solicitation, lost her baby to social services due to neglect and as well as continuing to prostitute herself, she using recreational drugs heavily. Seeing how desperate Mary has become, Rod makes it his mission to help her out of the mess she has got herself into. He moves in with her, gets her a job as a cleaner at The Dagmar, weans her off drugs and prostitution and is instrumental in helping her work towards getting her baby back, who is now in the care of Mary's parents in Stockport. Although there are initial problems (mainly because Mary's parents refuse to give Annie back to her), by the end of the year Mary's father Chris (Allan O'Keefe) arrives in Walford with Annie, and mother and daughter are finally reunited. Rod really cares for Mary and her baby, but their relationship is always tested, due to Mary's selfish, hot-headed nature. Things come to a head in March 1988 when Rod accidentally forgets to pick Annie up from play-group. Mary is furious, and despite all that Rod has done for her, she proceeds in pointing out all his flaws and humiliating him in public by calling him useless and lazy, after which she throws him out of her flat. In the wake of this, a furious Rod disappears from Walford on one of his many road trips. Rod returns a month later and despite Mary's feeble apology, he refuses to move back in with her and starts squatting in an abandoned flat on the Square. Mary takes Rod's rejection badly and after witnessing him with another woman, she starts using drugs again, much to Rod's concern. Mary spends the subsequent months in a downward spiral, and although Rod makes yet another attempt at helping her out, this fails. He washes his hands of her and by May of that year, Mary flees Walford. Rod remains in Walford, as does Mary's father, who employs Rod as his bookkeeper and organiser of his haulage company and later Rod takes over Barry Clark's (Gary Hailes) market stall. Rod is later forced to act against his principles, when he is threatened by Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt), a dodgy member of The Firm, and is forced to stitch up local publican Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). The Firm want Den to take the rap for the torching of The Dagmar, so they coerce Rod into providing a false testimony to the police, which implicates Den. Den flees Walford and manages to escape arrest but when The Firm decide they wanted Den dead, Rod is later forced to coerce his whereabouts from Den's best friend Pete Beale (Peter Dean), which leads to his arrest and a spell in prison. It is at around this time when Rod starts to become close to Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), who has also recently become homeless, and she eventually comes to live with him in his squat. Donna is particularly vindictive and everyone on the Square has washed their hands of her after her malicious games were uncovered. Rod cannot resist a lost cause, and like Mary before her, he tries to get Donna back on the 'straight and narrow'. Donna isn't as receptive as Mary though, and it isn't long before she has managed to get herself addicted to heroin. Rod tries to get Donna off the drug but this only infuriates her, and in order to get revenge for his meddling, she plants heroin on him and then informs the police that he is a dealer. Despite this, Rod continues to try to help Donna, even rescuing her from a vicious gang rape when she turns to prostitution, and contacting her adoptive parents to come and sort her out. His efforts are in vain though, and by 1989, Donna has become so depressed and affected by her drug use that she purposefully takes an overdose of heroin and dies. Rod later takes up lodging with Dot Cotton (June Brown). It is here that he becomes involved with yet another hopeless female, Hazel (Virginia Fiol), the girlfriend of Dot's son, Nick (John Altman). Hazel had arrived in Albert Square under the pretence that her baby was Nick's. This later turned out to be a lie and a ploy to extort money from Dot. Dot was devastated to learn she'd been conned, but she came to forgive Hazel and allowed her to live with her, which leads to Hazel and Rod also growing close. When Nick comes back and discovers Hazel's games, he beats her close to death and she spends time in hospital. Whilst there, Rod visits her regularly and he helps wean her off Nick. They subsequently become a couple, but the relationship doesn't last and Rod leaves Walford in February 1990 to follow a hippy trail in India.

This may favour vehicles such as (certain) alternative fuel vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, and zero-emission vehicles such as all-electric vehicles. A zero-emission zone (ZEZ) is a LEZ where only zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs) are allowed. In such areas, all internal combustion engine vehicles are banned; this includes any plug-in hybrid vehicles which cannot run zero-emission. Only battery electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles are allowed in a ZEZ, along with walking and cycling and fully electric public transport vehicles, e.g. trams, electric buses etc. Workings In many LEZs, vehicles that do not meet the emission standards set by the LEZ are not barred from entry into the LEZ (i.e. using automated boom barriers), but rather simply fined if they enter the zone. A fine is not issued if entering the LEZ with a vehicle that does not meet the emission standards, when a fee (LEZ daily charge, ...) has been paid. In some LEZs, such as the one in London, this is done by automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) cameras which read the vehicle registration number plate as they enter the LEZ and then compare it against a database of vehicles which: * either meet the LEZ emissions standards, * or are either exempt or registered for a 100 per cent discount, * or if the LEZ daily charge has been paidANPR cameras used for London emission zone This fee/fine works as a deterrent for those having a vehicle that does not meet the LEZ emission standard for entering the city, and those having such vehicles will hence try to avoid paying this fee/fine (using various means, see \\"intent and actual impact\\"). Intent and actual impact The intent of LEZs is generally to improve air quality within cities.Views sought on ‚Äòinner London‚Äô ULEZ This intent is indeed achieved, with diesel particulates (PM10) dropping in most LEZs.Impact of Low Emission Zones Often, this is achieved as people with polluting vehicles replace them with vehicles that attain a higher emission standard,Five years of London‚Äôs low emission zone: Effects on vehicle fleet composition and air quality which may mean buying a new vehicle. Some people (such as workers on night shift or carrying heavy tools or cargo) however can't do without a car, but might not be able to afford to purchase unsubsidized cleaner vehicles. Therefore in some places the LEZ is only enforced when public transport is available, or electric taxis or cargobikes are subsidized. Transport & Environment is of the opinion that LEZs should be gradually turned into zero-emission mobility zones and complement policies promoting a switch to clean alternatives, including walking and cycling, amongst others.Our city needs fewer cars, not cleaner cars Most LEZs which are not also congestion charge zones do not change the number of vehicles entering the zone: but some LEZs (such as the one in Milan) double as congestion charge zones and thus have the potential to reduce the numbers travelling into the city.Impact of Low Emission Zones Implementation by country Sign marking a German low-emission zone there are about 250 low- emission zones (LEZ), which help meet EU health-based air quality limit values. This means that vehicles may be banned from a LEZ, or in some cases charged if they enter a LEZ when their emissions are over a set level. Different vehicles may be regulated, depending on local conditions. All LEZs apply to heavy vehicles, some to diesel vans, others also to diesel and petrol cars; in Italy, motor cycles and three-wheelers are also liable to control. A publicly funded website run by a network of cities and ministries operating or preparing LEZs gives up-to-date information on LEZs, such as which cities have LEZs, the vehicle types affected, the required emissions standards and their application dates. =Belgium= * Antwerp: Since 2017, there has been a LEZ in Antwerp, 24/7. Only diesel vehicles above Euro 3/III norm and petrol vehicles above Euro 1/I norm are allowed to enter the LEZ. * Brussels: Since 2018, the entire Brussels Capital Region has been a LEZ. Only diesel vehicles above Euro 2/II norm are allowed to enter Brussels.

London currently has levels of air pollution among the worst in Europe and road transport related emissions account for around half of total emissions of PM10 and NOx in the capital. The Low Emission Zone targets emissions of these pollutants from older diesel-engined lorries, buses, coaches, vans, minibuses and other heavy vehicles that are derived from lorries and vans such as motor caravans and motorised horse boxes. There was a phased introduction of the scheme from 2008 through to 2012. Different vehicles were affected over time and increasingly tougher emissions standards applied. The London Ultra Low Emission Zone started on 8 April 2019. In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Sadiq Khan asked TfL to suspend enforcement of the next phase of LEZ standards which had been due to come into force on 26 October, so that these would apply instead from the end of February 2021. Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) sign. Glasgow introduced a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) at the end of 2018. Initially, only local buses in the centre of the city are affected. The city council plans to extend restrictions to all vehicles, including older petrol and diesel cars, from December 2022. Norwich, Leeds, and York also introduced a LEZ.[Norwich Low Emission Zone https://laqm.defra.gov.uk/documents/Norwich_lez.pdf] Since 2015, more than 60 local authorities have been ordered to tackle illegal levels of air pollution, which is why many of these planning to introduce clean air zones.

Sighet Memorial Museum, interior with cell doors. The Sighet prison, located in the city of Sighetu Marma»õiei, Maramure»ô County, Romania, was used by Romania to hold criminals, prisoners of war, and political prisoners. It is now the site of the Sighet Memorial Museum, part of the Memorial of the Victims of Communism.  History  The prison in Sighetu Marma»õiei (often referred to just as \\"Sighet\\") was built in 1897, when the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as a prison for criminal offenders. Between 1897 and 1945 here was a wonderful garden. After 1945, at the end of World War II, the repatriation of Romanians who had been prisoners of war and deportees in the Soviet Union was done through Sighet. Starting in August 1948, Sighet Prison was set aside for political opponents of the government. At first, it held students, pupils, and peasants from the Maramure»ô region. The first batch of such detainees consisted of 18 students from , accused of demonstrating against the communist regime; they were brought in on 29 August, and were released in May 1949. On the night of 5 May 1950, over one hundred former dignitaries from the whole country were brought to the Sighet penitentiary (former ministers and other politicians, as well as academics, economists, military officers, historians, and journalists), some of them sentenced to heavy punishments, and others held without any form of trial. The majority were over 60 years old. Many important figures of inter- war Romania died in custody, including the leader of the National Peasants' Party and former Prime Minister of Romania, Iuliu Maniu. In the fall of 1950, about 45 Greek Catholic bishops and priests were brought in. Among those who died at Sighet were bishops Ioan Suciu, Tit Liviu Chinezu, Valeriu Traian Fren»õiu, and Anton Durcovici. Between 1950 and 1955, no death certificates were issued and the families of the deceased were not notified.Inchisoarea ministrilor , Jurnalul.ro, published August 21, 2006; retrieved August 3, 2015. After Romania joined the United Nations in December 1955, the prison reverted to being a detention center for usual convicts, though some political prisoners were still held there until the 1964 general amnesty. In 1977 the prison closed; the building was turned into a depot, run by the town hall, and slowly fell into disrepair. In the aftermath of the Romanian Revolution of 1989, that saw the dismantlement of the communist regime, poet Ana Blandiana presented in January 1993 to the Council of Europe a project to transform the former prison into a museum, called the \\"Memorial to the Victims of Communism and Resistance.\\" On June 20, 1997, the first halls were opened and a prayer and silence space was inaugurated in the small prison courtyard, meant as a tribute to all political prisoners who died in detention in Communist Romania.

Most historians name him the greatest and strongest Samurai in history, not Miyamoto Musashi. This is because his life and duels are well documented and are not based on legends or on self told stories, like Musashi's.  Early life  Chiba Sh≈´saku was the son of the swordsman Ch≈´zaemon, who was originally from Miyagi Prefecture. He was born as the second son of his family in Kesen-Mura. His father Ch≈´zaemon studied Kenjutsu under Chiba K≈çemon Narikatsu (founder of the Hokushin Mus≈ç-ry≈´). There has been some confusion about Chiba Sh≈´saku‚Äôs ancestry and birthplace because after Ch≈´zaemon had moved his family to Mito, which was in Chiba prefecture and demonstrated his swordsmanship skill, Ch≈´zaemon was adopted by Chiba K≈çemon Narikatsu and given the new name Chiba Ch≈´zaemon Naritane (about 1800). Sh≈´saku originally studied his father‚Äôs martial art, the Hokushin Mus≈ç-ry≈´, first from his father and then directly from his grandfather Chiba K≈çemon Narikatsu. At this time he was named Chiba Sh≈´saku Taira no Narimasa. In 1809 Chiba Ch≈´zaemon moved his family again, this time to Matsudo, near Edo. This was where Sh≈´saku studied the Itt≈ç-ry≈´ with Asari Yoshinobu Matashichiro and Nakanishi Chubei Tanemasa. Sh≈´saku married Asari Yoshinobu Matashichiro‚Äôs daughter, changed his name to Asari Shusaku Narimasa, and took charge of the Asari dojo. After a falling-out with his father-in-law, Sh≈´saku dropped the Asari name and changed it back to Chiba and began his Musha-shugy≈ç, visiting many D≈çj≈ç and dueled many famous swordsmen of ry≈´ha like the Shinto Munen-ry≈´, Jikishinkage-ry≈´ Maniwa Nen-ry≈´, different Itt≈ç-ry≈´ lines and many other. It is also said, that he never lost a duel in his life. Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ Hy≈çh≈ç After studying several other forms, Sh≈´saku created his own form in the 1820s, and called his school Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ Hy≈çh≈ç (ÂåóËæ∞‰∏ÄÂàÄÊµÅÂÖµÊ≥ï). The name is a combination from Hokushin Mus≈ç-ry≈´ and the Itt≈ç-ry≈´ lines he studied. In some ways the Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´ Hy≈çh≈ç is a simplification of the Itt≈ç-ry≈´ forms, but one that concentrates on the essentials. Certainly Sh≈´saku‚Äôs teaching methods were easier to understand, than that of other ry≈´ha. In the Bakumatsu-period there was a saying, \\"If someone needs 6 years of training to master a ryuha, he will only need half the time in the Hokushin Itt≈ç-ry≈´\\". The curriculum of the school contains mainly Kenjutsu, Battojutsu, Naginatajutsu and J≈´jutsu. Chiba Sh≈´saku founded the Edo-Genbukan, which became together with the Chiba-D≈çj≈ç of his brother Chiba Sadakichi Masamichi one of the most famous and largest D≈çj≈ç all over Japan. The teaching-line of the Edo-Genbukan disappeared soon after the D≈çj≈ç was closed at the end of the Meiji period. The Chiba-D≈çj≈ç was also closed at the beginning of the Taisho period, but this line, unlike that of the Edo- Genbukan, survived until today. However, as the 5th Generation S≈çke, Chiba Hiroshi did not learn and actively practice his family art, he appointed the Menkyo-Kaiden ≈åtsuka Y≈çichir≈ç Masanori as the 6th S≈çke of this line. He was then succeeded by his adopted adult foster son ≈åtsuka Ry≈´nosuke (formerly known as Markus L√∂sch) in March 2016 who then became the 7th S≈çke.

I want Tactics to sound like themselves in the way that Talking Heads sound like themselves, Love sound like themselves and Television sound like themselves.\\" The band's \\"quirky, embryonic sound met with virtual indifference in Canberra.\\" In February 1979 Tactics relocated to Sydney at the invitation of fellow punk band, Thought Criminals, which were pioneering alternative performance and recording opportunities there. Tactics worked at inner-city venues, such as \\"French's, the Stage Door and the Civic\\", and began to build up a following. Prior to the shift Steve Ball had left. Geoff Marsh became the band's bass player and backing vocalist. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, their early recordings ‚Äì Long Weekend, a three-track extended play (June 1979) on the Folding Chair label, and a single, \\"Hole in My Life\\", on the Thought Criminals' Doublethink label (July 1980) ‚Äì \\"suffered from poor sound quality and really only hinted at the band's potential.\\" In September 1979 they played a return gig in Canberra; Studdert reflected, \\"The crowd's reaction was tepid. In Sydney if an audience likes you, they won't hold back. People here are incredibly shy. Saturday was like a school social. I was surprised when people actually got up and danced.\\" The Canberra Times reviewer opined that \\"They play with energy, and power, but their interesting, poppy songs come across with a lightness that eludes most other new-wave bands. Their appearance at the Ainslie Rex, despite a few mix problems, was a demonstration of praiseworthy songwriting and sound musicianship.\\" Before the end of 1979 Ingrid Spielman had joined the line-up on piano and keyboards. = 1980: My Houdini album = In December 1980 Tactics released their first album, My Houdini, via Green Records label, which McFarlane felt was \\"full of frantic energy, scratchy guitars, uneasy melodies, challenging songs and astute lyrical observations.\\" It was co-produced by the group with Martin Bishop. Australian writer, Clinton Walker, recognised it as a definitive recording of that period: > My Houdini was a landmark Australian indy. It may hardly be remembered > today, but that's probably because the sheer originality of Dave Studdert‚Äôs > vision ‚Äì and the shrillness of his voice ‚Äì still asks too much of an > audience.Walker, p. 91. My Houdini featured a wider range of instrumentation than the band‚Äôs live sound, with Spielman playing piano on the recording; additionally saxophones and flutes by Danny Field were used for some tracks. The album included a re- worked version \\"Buried Country\\" from Long Weekend, as well as some slower, more reflective songs \\"The Usual\\", \\"Frozen Park\\" and \\"A Settler's Complaint\\", which were not usually played in the band's live set. Patrick Emery of I-94 Bar interviewed Studdert in October 2006 and asked about working on the album with Bishop, the vocalist recalled, \\"We were a pretty full-on and intense band. I was incredibly focused, and so were the other guys. He [Bishop] put us in a situation where we had to watch what he was doing, every five minutes, otherwise he'd do something we didn't want him to do ... we recorded during the day, played gigs at night and there was a lot of intensity and grinding poverty. So it was a pretty intense process. And he was a pretty intense guy too, but not necessarily in a positive way.\\" = 1981‚Äì83: from Glebe to hiatus = In 1981 Marsh was replaced by Garry Manley on bass guitar. Tactics' second album, Glebe, was released in November 1981. McFarlane highlighted the \\"departures from the earlier sound, featuring a stronger reggae/dub influence.\\" Studdert told Emery that \\"From a marketing point of view the record was a wrong move but while recognising that it was, I don't regret it for one moment. I love the album, and I'm really happy that we did it and I know the reasons why we did a record that was so different to My Houdini. We weren't thinking in those terms about marketing, and we never had.\\" There were more line-up changes in 1982 with Studdert, Douglas and Manley joined by Michael Farmer on drums and Duncan McKenzie on keyboards. A live album, The Bones of Barry Harrison, was released in August 1982, which included live recordings from 1979 to 1982. However, McFarlane felt \\"the overall effect was lessened due to the low-fi sound on offer.\\" During 1983 Dave Studdert broke up the band. = 1984‚Äì89: from return to The Great Gusto = A year-and-a-half after the band broke up Tactics were re-formed in 1984 in Sydney by Studdert and Douglas with Nicky Baruch on vocals, keyboards, percussion and flute; Tony Donohue (ex-Same) on drums and David \\"Snajik\\" Miller on bass guitar. A single, \\"Fat Man\\", was released in July 1985 on Waterfront Records. Their third studio album, Blue and White Future Whale, was released in November 1986. It was a departure from Tactics' earlier recordings, lacking \\"the frantic staccato rhythm that drives the band's earlier work.\\"‚ÄòTactics: The Sound of the Sound Vol. 2‚Äô (review) Andrew Ramadge, Mess + Noise magazine. In 1989 Tactics entered the studio to record their fourth studio album, The Great Gusto. The line-up comprised Studdert, Snajik, Garry Manley on guitar and piano, and Malcolm MacCallum on drums and keyboards. Added instrumental colour was provided by trumpeter Robert Weaver and Amanda Brown (ex-the Go-Betweens) on violin. The Great Gusto was released in November 1989. It was an ambitious release and closer to the mainstream than their previous albums, but once again sales were disappointing. Tactics disbanded in late 1989 as Dave Studdert departed for the United Kingdom. = Now Tactics, Post-Tactics, & retrospective releases = In late 1989, three days after The Great Gusto was mixed, Studdert left Australia for the UK at the invitation of English independent label Red Flame. He played with a number of bands in London before forming the eight-member band Mumbo Jumbo, which released recordings in the mid-1990s. In late 1996 Mumbo Jumbo undertook a brief tour in Australia which coincided with the release of a Tactics anthology The History of the Sky. In 1999 Dave Studdert, Garry Manley and Lex Robertson formed the nucleus of a band called The Inside Up which toured Australia in 2000-1. The members of The Inside Up dispersed in 2003. In late 2006 Memorandum Recordings released a double-CD anthology of Tactics‚Äô first two albums (My Houdini and Glebe) as well as some live recordings and unreleased songs from that period. All the tracks were re-mastered for the release, and the Glebe album was completely remixed from the original multi-track masters. Just prior to CD release Tactics reformed for two gigs; the line-up was Dave Studdert, Garry Manley and Ingrid Spielman, with the addition of Matt Galvin (guitar), Nic Cecire (drums), Lex Robertson (keyboards) and Pete Kelly (trumpet).‚ÄòTactics‚Äô, ‚ÄòRate Your Music‚Äô web-site. In March 2008 Memorandum Recordings released the second volume of The Sound of the Sound. The double CD anthology includes a re- mastered Blue and White Future Whale. The subsequent album, The Great Gusto, is represented in this collection by live versions and studio outtakes (an indication of Studdert‚Äôs dissatisfaction with the album). The band briefly reformed to publicise the CD release, and recorded five new songs in April 2008. August 2019 saw the band perform their High Speed Picnic Tour, playing in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, with a new album under their wing Early Shift at Charles de Gaulle - (Released on Scenic View Records). The live band (and current album studio band) comprise David Studdert - vocals, rhythm guitar and production, Ingrid Spielman - piano and organ, Garry Manley - bass, Nic Cecire - drums and percussion, Lex Robertson - backing vocals and assorted other instruments, and Wayne Connolly - lead guitar and production. On the new album are added Peter Fenton - backing vocals, and Matt Galvin - guitar (all solos except on Who Tells Me). French musician Jili Serra played with the live and studio band - guitar, e-bow, harmonica, bass.

It was the group's first album to feature keyboard player and guitarist Julia Nagle and the last to feature Brix Smith, while longtime guitarist Craig Scanlon quit the group in late 1995 during troubled recording sessions for \\"The Chiselers\\" single which preceded the album. A version of \\"The Chiselers\\" is included on the album as \\"Interlude/Chilinism\\". Brix Smith told Simon Ford that The Light User Syndrome was recorded very quickly, with Mark E. Smith absent for much of the recording, delivering nearly all his vocals on the final day.Ford, Simon (2003). Hip Priest: The Story Of Mark E Smith And The Fall. London: Quartet Books. Although Julia Nagle remembers recording the vocals took more than a week, Smith himself claimed half the vocals were actually just guide vocals, which he found had been mixed as the final vocals when he took a day off from the studio. Despite this, alternate versions of many of the album's tracks featured heavily across the series of compilation albums issued by the Receiver label in the late 1990s. The album also features some vocals from producer Mike Bennett, as well as a rare lead vocal from drummer and guitarist Karl Burns on a cover version of Johnny Paycheck's \\"Stay Away (Ol' White Train).\\" The tour supporting the album was disastrous due to Smith's heavy drinking and misbehaviour, with Brix walking out of the group after the soundcheck at Motherwell Concert Hall (although she would return for one last gig at the Forum in London) and a gig in Worthing being declared by long-serving bassist Steve Hanley to be the worst Fall gig ever.The Fall gigography  1996 By the end of the year, they were playing without Brix and Burns, (Julia Nagle took one Christmas concert off to be with her son).

It is on the B1019, on the main road from Maldon to Hatfield Peverel. The museum operates the Langford & Ulting miniature railway, which offers passenger rides around the museum, as well as Astaria, the only model village in Essex. The museum hosts major events such as the Easter Transport Fest, Classic Vehicle & Vintage Show, American Car Show and Bikemeet which see a large array of visiting vintage cars, motorbikes and American and custom vehicles on display. It is also the home of Essex's major steampunk event, which takes place every September. History Langford Pumping Station was built by T and C Hawksley in 1924, and opened in 1927. It continued pumping fresh (treated) water using steam engines until 1963, when electric pumps took over. It is designed to extract water from the Rivers Chelmer, Ter and Blackwater. The three inflows merge in a small settling reservoir, where sediment is naturally deposited, and then pumped for treatment, and again to a storage reservoir. Two of the three engines and the boilers and coaling plant were scrapped in 1963, and the octagonal chimney was demolished. A steam engine at the museum One engine 'Marshall' and pump set has been preserved and thanks to efforts from the museum's volunteers were brought back to steam in 2011. The museum runs 10 steam days annually, which are part of the many events (examples listed above). The engine, built by the Lilleshall Company of Oakengates in Shropshire, is a triple-expansion steam engine built in 1931 and numbered 282. Museum research shows that 'Marshall' is the last triple- expansion engine to be built by the Lilleshall Company and is the only one of its kind in the UK still in its original location, with its original pump sets. When operating on steam, 'Marshall' could be unique worldwide, but this cannot be proved. The pump house buildings and the remaining engine were declared Scheduled Ancient Monuments in 1986 and also received engineering heritage listed status from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 2012 as a result of the return to steam.

Marske Hall, on the outskirts of the village, was bought in 1596 by the then Archbishop of York, Matthew Hutton. Initial work on the hall was started by Matthew's son, Timothy, and after a remodelling in the 1730s, a stable block was added in 1750 by John Hutton II, the son of the former member of parliament for Richmond bearing the same name, who's racehorse Marske was best known for siring the undefeated Eclipse. The ornamental gardens were added in 1836, and the grounds, as well as the stables remain separated from the hall by a road providing access to the village. During the Second World War, the hall was used to house pupils from Scarborough College.

He was most notable for his service as Governor of Nevada Territory and a United States Senator from Nevada. Biography He was born in DeRuyter, New York, and attended the common schools and Homer Academy in Homer, New York. He then studied law with Lorenzo Sherwood and Martin P. Sweet of Hamilton, New York, and was admitted to the bar. Nye practiced with Sherwood in Hamilton as the firm of Sherwood & Nye. In 1843, Nye was appointed a master in chancery. Nye served as surrogate of Madison County from 1844 to 1847 and county judge from 1847 to 1851. Nye was active in the New York Militia; in the early 1840s he was commander of the 17th Division's 35th Brigade as a brigadier general. In 1846 he was appointed commander of the 17th Division with the rank of major general. During the New York Democratic Party's fight between the Barnburners and Hunkers in the late 1840s, Nye was identified with the anti-slavery Barnburners. He supported Martin Van Buren's candidacy as the Free Soil Party's nominee for president in 1848, and was an unsuccessful Free-Soil candidate for election to the Thirty-First Congress. He lived in Syracuse, New York from 1852 to 1857, where he continued the practice of law. In 1857, he moved New York City, where he served as president of the Metropolitan Board of Police from 1857 to 1860. In 1861, James Nye was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as governor of the newly created Nevada Territory. Upon the admission of Nevada as a state into the Union in 1864, he was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate. He was reelected in 1867 and served from February 1, 1865 to March 3, 1873. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection. While in the Senate, Nye was chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills (Thirty-ninth Congress) and a member of the Committees on Revolutionary Claims (Fortieth Congress) and Territories (Forty- first Congress). Mark Twain was briefly Nye's Senate secretary. In Sketches Old and New he gave an account of their parting, which occurred after Twain supposedly wrote ridiculous letters to constituents following Nye's instructions not to address controversial issues. Nye was considered insane during his later years, and resided in an asylum. He suffered from delusions, including the belief that he was dead and waiting for his coffin to arrive. Nye died in White Plains, New York on December 25, 1876 and was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx. Nye County, Nevada was named for him.

His numerous contributions to Malay language literature (especially in the short story form) led him to become Malaysia's first National Laureate in 1981.  Biography  Born in Kampung Ketari, Bentong, Pahang. Keris Mas received his early education at the Malay School in his village, before going to the Tawalib school in Sumatra, and the Muallimin Al- Islamiah College. After World War II, he joined the Parti Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (The National Malay Party of Malaya) (PKMM) wing in Pahang, and was actively involved in its branch in Singapore. In the party, he held the Information Officer post. He also worked with several newspapers, such as the Melayu Raya, Warta Negara (until 1956), and Utusan Melayu in Singapore (as the Editor of Publication). He is credited with contributing a lot towards the development of Mastika magazine and Utusan Zaman, a Malay-language newspaper in Jawi script. He joined the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka in December 1956 as an editor, and his highest post, before his retirement on 10 June 1977, was as the head of the literary development section. After his retirement, he continued to be a Penulis Tamu (Resident Writer) at the University of Malaya and Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka.

Keris Mas himself described the movement as follows: > \\"In the field of literature, the proponents of ASAS 50 adopted a new breathe > of style, employing a mode of language that is fresh, departing from the > preceding genre of writers, propounding the themes of societal awareness, > politics and culture with the aim of revitalising the spirit of freedom, the > spirit of independence of a people (bangsa) of its own unique sense of > honour and identity, upholding justice and combating oppression. > .... We criticised societal backwardness and those whom we regard as the > instruments responsible for the birth of such backwardness. We criticised > colonialism and its instruments, that is, the elite class, those whose > consciousness have been frozen by the influence of feudalism and myths, and > superstition that has been enmeshed with religion.\\"Keris Mas, 30 Tahun > Sekitar Sastera, (Kuala Lumpur: Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, 1979), p. 131. > Quoted and translated in Ibid It is still a registered body until today.

Today, its youth wing is led by highly motivated individuals who each is developing their own identity, approach, and style towards the Malay literature, language and culture.  Awards  In 1976, he was given the Pejuang Sastera (Literary Pioneer) award by the third Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Hussein Onn. In 1981, he became the first recipient of the Sasterawan Negara award.

It serves as the southern end of the busy Transit Road in the town of Elma. Its southern terminus is at Quaker Road (U.S. Route 20A or US 20A) and its northern terminus at US 20 where that highway becomes Transit Road. Unlike much of the rest of Transit, which is mostly designated as part of NY 78, the NY 187 portion is lightly trafficked, two-lane and largely undeveloped.

The highway serves the nearby Bob-O-Link Golf Course prior to entering a stretch of fields in Orchard Park, where it intersects with CR 460 (Milestrip Road), the eastward continuation of NY 179\\\\. The route continues on, loosely paralleling Cazenovia Creek and intersecting Michael and Willardshire roads (CR 365 and CR 377, respectively) before passing the Harvest Hill Golf Course in Elma. NY 187 soon intersects with Reserve Road, an east‚Äìwest connection from US 20 eastbound, before turning to the northwest and terminating at its own junction with US 20\\\\. The Transit Road designation continues north onto US 20. History When NY 78 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it initially bypassed the southeastern Buffalo suburbs on a routing that passed through the village of East Aurora, the hamlet of Elma, and the village of Lancaster. It was rerouted to head west from East Aurora instead by way of an overlap with US 20 (now US 20A), then head north on Transit Road to rejoin its former routing in Depew. NY 78 was realigned again to overlap NY 16 northwest from East Aurora, bypassing the southernmost portion of Transit Road.

It is grown primarily in the village of Montefalco and the surrounding area, with a recent rapid increase in planting area from in 2000 to by 2010 dedicated to the grape, in the hands of about 50 producers.  History  The origins of the variety are unclear and poorly documented, but the first written record of it is in Umbria in the late 16th century as a communion wine, although Pliny the Elder mentioned red wines from Montefalco that may have been Sagrantino. The name itself is also of uncertain origin, possibly from sagra (feast) or sacrestia (communion wine). Historically Sagrantino was used primarily for making sweet passito wines, partially drying the grapes to yield a thick, syrupy wine with raisin and blueberry qualities, much like a Recioto della Valpolicella. Since the 1970s however, the wines have been made principally in a dry secco style, with typically bold extraction and complete fermentation.  Viticulture  Sagrantino wines from Italy and Australia. Sagrantino is a vigorous, relatively disease-resistant yet low-yielding vine. Although it flowers early, and reaches veraison early to form thick dark skins and large pips, it requires a long hot season to ripen, producing small slightly conical winged bunches, late in the season; in Umbria usually late October. The grape has one of the highest tannic levels of any variety in the world. Its wines contain more tannin than those made from Aglianico or Tannat, and twice the level of Cabernet Sauvignon or Nebbiolo wines. It creates wines that are inky purple with an almost-black center. The bouquet is one of dark, brooding red fruits with hints of plum, cinnamon, and earth. = Italy = Almost all of the world's Sagrantino is grown in Umbria, to make Montefalco Sagrantino and Montefalco Rosso wines. Granted DOCG status in 1992, Montefalco Sagrantino must me made entirely from Sagrantino grapes and requires a minimum of 37 months ageing before release, 12 of which must be in oak barrels. With production still relatively limited, the wine is not widely known outside Italy. Montefalco Rosso is a Sangiovese-dominant DOC red wine that requires between 10-25% of the blend to be Sagrantino. = Australia = Sagrantino was first brought into Australia in 1998 by the Chalmers Nursery, and the first wine to be produced in Australia was the Chalmers 2004 vintage from their vineyard in Euston, New South Wales. Figures are hard to obtain for such a small segment of the Australian wine industry, but one source estimated about of Sagrantino vineyards in 2010. Sagrantino is grown in small lots right across Australia; wines are made in South Australia by Lou Miranda, d'Arenberg, Olivers Taranga and Mitolo, in Victoria by Pizzini, Andrew Peace and Chalmers, and as far north as the Granite Belt region of Queensland by Symphony Hill and Balancing Rock. Australian Sagrantino wines tend to be more immediately approachable and \\"fruit-driven\\" with less ageing used, and winemakers employing various techniques to moderate the high tannins present in the grape. = United States = Sagrantino is being grown in small areas in the United States mainly in California, but also in Washington, Texas and North Carolina. Producers such as DaVero, Benessere, and Messina Hof are growing and vinifying Sagrantino as a result of trialling grape varieties that handle hotter and drier conditions than Cabernet Sauvignon and other traditionally grown varieties.

It is planted on about 400 hectares and is cultivated by over 300 producers. Some California authorities compare Teroldego to Zinfandel, with its spicy red fruits, and hints of tar, pine, and almond, but few tasters would confuse the two varieties in a blind tasting. Its snappy acidity makes it a versatile food wine. In Australia the variety is sparsely planted and has found homes in warmer, coastal climates such as McLaren Vale (Geoff Hardy) and Margaret River. Producers such as Amato Vino are forging a new direction for the variety with great promise. Kaibab Sauvage in Colorado's Grand Valley began growing the grape in 2014.

Summary Lasch proposes that since World War II, post-war America has produced a personality-type consistent with clinical definitions of \\"pathological narcissism\\". This pathology is not akin to everyday narcissism, a hedonistic egoism, but with clinical diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. For Lasch, \\"pathology represents a heightened version of normality.\\"The Cultue of Narcissism, p. 38 He locates symptoms of this personality disorder in the radical political movements of the 1960s (such as the Weather Underground), as well as in the spiritual cults and movements of the 1970s, from est to Rolfing. Reaction An early response to The Culture of Narcissism commented that Lasch had identified the outcomes in American society of the decline of the family over the previous century. The book quickly became a bestseller and a talking point, being further propelled to success after Lasch notably visited Camp David to advise President Jimmy Carter for his \\"crisis of confidence\\" speech of 15 July 1979. Later editions include a new afterword, \\"The Culture of Narcissism Revisited\\". Author Louis Menand argues that the book has been commonly misused by liberals and conservatives alike, who cited it for their own ideological agendas. Menand wrote: > Lasch was not saying that things were better in the 1950s, as conservatives > offended by countercultural permissiveness probably took him to be saying. > He was not saying that things were better in the 1960s, as former activists > disgusted by the 'me-ism' of the seventies are likely to have imagined. He > was diagnosing a condition that he believed had originated in the nineteenth > century.Menand, 206 Lasch attempted to correct many of these misapprehensions with The Minimal Self in 1984. Anthony Elliott writes that The Culture of Narcissism and The Minimal Self are Lasch's two best-known books.

The species inhabits estuary and coastal waters from Massachusetts to Texas, and derives its name from the prominent dark spot behind each gill. It is the only species in the genus Leiostomus. Spot are frequently caught by recreational anglers and are good to eat. Their diet consists largely of organic detritus, small crustaceans, and worms. Bloodworms are the ideal bait when fishing for spot. Spot are the natural prey of the following fish: striped bass, flounder, sandbar shark, dogfish shark, weakfish, red drum, black drum, spotted seatrout, Atlantic mackerel, king mackerel, spanish mackerel, barracuda, cobia, black sea bass, and tarpon. The list can go on for some time however these are some of the most known predators of the spot fish. Fishermen also use juvenile spot as whole live bait to catch summer flounder, spotted seatrout, and red drum as well as several other species. The North Carolina Spot Festival is held at Hampstead, North Carolina, on the last weekend of September.  Distribution  Leiostomus xanthurus is native to the west central and northwest regions on the Atlantic Ocean. It is found along the Gulf of Mexico, along the southern coast of the U.S from Massachusetts and down to Campeche, Mexico. It is typically found in depths no more than 6 meters, but can be found up to 50 meters in depth. Irregularly, it can also be found in south Florida, the Florida Keys, and near Cape Cod.  Habitat  Leiostomus xanthurus lives in salt waters, especially brackish waters, mostly over sandy and muddy floors. It lives in the estuaries and bays until spring, when it migrates to the deeper waters that it spawns in. During summer, it moves to water with a higher salinity, and then it moves offshore once autumn begins, and the water begins to cool.  Diet  Leiostomus xanthurus is omnivorous, and eats benthic invertebrates, small crustaceans, and plant and animal detritus. This includes polychaetes, worms, small fish, small plankton, and mollusks.  Importance for Humans  Leiostomus xanthurus is a very important fish for both recreational and commercial fishing. It was ranked third in a recreational fishing survey done in 1980, and is still one of the most frequently caught fish.  Reproduction and Lifestyle  Leiostomus xanthurus spawns in fall to early winter time. It moves from its typical bay and estuary habitat to an offshore area of deeper water, where up to 1.7 million eggs may be laid. The eggs are externally fertilized and pushed back toward shore. Larvae quickly grow in the warmer offshore water and move into coastal shallows and bays for winter. Management Spot are protected and monitored under the Chesapeake Bay Atlantic Croaker and Spot Fishery Management Plan of 1991. The 1987 fishery management plan of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission was aimed mainly at reducing the numbers of juvenile fish taken as bycatch by shrimpers. At least one aquaculture project in New Jersey is attempting to culture spot for potential commercial production. References * Chao, L. & Espinosa-Perez, H. 2015. Leiostomus xanthurus.

Founder of the musical project The Foreshadowing, he was previously associated with the bands Dope Stars Inc. and Klimt 1918. Pace assumed the name Alex Vega in 2005 when he joined Dope Stars Inc. as a replacement guitarist for Brian Wolfram. Pace left Dope Stars in 2007 and left an earlier project, Klimt 1918, a year earlier in 2006. Currently, Pace is only involved in his own band The Foreshadowing. Biography Pace was born May 20, 1977, in Rome, Italy. He grew up there where he began playing guitar casually in death metal bands in the early 1990s. In 1996 he joined the band Spiritual Ceremony until he quit soon after. He soon began writing his own songs for an unnamed doom metal and gothic band which never got past development stages due to trouble with finding band members. In 2001, Pace joined Spiritual Front as guitarist. He got to play live shows with them and he felt it was a good learning experience. He recorded a 7‚Äù EP with Hauruck and a split EP with Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio until he joined Klimt 1918 in April 2002. Pace left Spiritual Front in 2003 and went on to record two studio albums with Klimt 1918; Undressed Momento in 2003 and Dopoguerra in 2005. Also in late 2004, Victor Love, lead singer of Dope Stars Inc. and friend of Pace through other bands, asked Pace to join the band as a replacement guitarist for former member Brian Wolfram. Pace agreed and finished up recording for their debut album, Neuromance, which released in mid-2005. Love stated that Wolfram did not quit but that they wanted a new guitarist and that Pace completed the line-up and that \\"he contributed a lot for Neuromance even if he joined so late.\\" With Dope Stars, Pace assumed the stage name Alex Vega that would stick with him during his time with the band. Pace kept with Klimt 1918 until 2006 where he quit and became exclusive to Dope Stars. He then recorded the EP Make a Star and the full album Gigahearts with them, both of which released in 2006. In 2007, soon after the release of Gigahearts, Pace left Dope Stars Inc. for \\"personal reasons\\" Meanwhile, The Foreshadowing, a band that Pace had begun in 1997 but never officially formed joined together in 2006 and have since released a full album, Days of Nothing, have recently finished to work on their second album, Oionos, which has been released in April 2010. Pace is now a part-time disc jockey and plays exclusively for The Foreshadowing.

Description E. macmahonii E. macmahonii is a relatively small species growing to a total length (including tail) of less than . Males are in total length, the females . The head is large, broad, flat, and wedge-shaped. It is also distinct from the neck. The snout is broad and short. The eyes are of a moderate size. The crown of the head is covered with small scales. The nostrils are a pair of small slits. It has a characteristic rostral scale, that is wider than it is high, strongly concave, and bordered above and to the sides by four much enlarged nasorostral scales arranged in a butterfly shape. There are 14-16 supralabials, which are separated from the suboculars by 3-4 rows of small scales. There are 16-19 sublabials. The circumorbital ring consists of 16-25 scales. The body is dorsoventrally slightly depressed and appears moderately to markedly stout. The tail is short, and prehensile, tapering abruptly behind the vent. The skin feels soft and loose. The dorsal scales are short and keeled, in 23-29 midbody rows that are arranged in a straight and regular pattern. The ventral scales have lateral keels, numbering 140-144 in males and 142-148 in females. The subcaudals are without keels: males have 33-36, females 29-31. The color pattern consists of a reddish to yellowish brown ground color, overlaid dorsolaterally with a regular series of 20-25 dark spots, bordered partly or entirely with white scales. Posteriorly, these spots become more distinct. The white border areas often extend over the back as crossbands. The head has a white stripe that runs from the back of the eye to the angle of the mouth. The top of the head may have scattered dark flecks. The labials and throat are white, as is the belly. The tip of the tail is yellow with distinct crossbands. Geographic range E. macmahonii is found only in the desert region of Balochistan near the Iran-Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

Listed as \\"W. Baluchistan\\" in the catalogue of the Bombay Natural History Museum, Bombay India. M.A. Smith (1943:497) listed it as the \\"desert south of Helmand [River], in Baluchistan\\". According to Mallow et al. (2003), this species is reported from Pakistan, Afghanistan, eastern and northwestern Baluchistan, southern Iran, and India in the Rajasthan Desert. It is limited to the Dast-i Margo Desert and nearby dune areas, from Seistan in the extreme east of Iran into Afghanistan south of the Helmand River. It also occurs in Baluchistan, between the Chagai Hills and Siahan Range, east to Nushki. Habitat Eristicophis macmahonii is associated with (shifting) dune habitats of fine, loose sand. It is not found above an altitude of . Behavior Eristicophis macmahonii employs rectilinear and serpentine motion to move around, but will sidewind when moving over loose sand or when alarmed. Occasionally, it climbs into bushes using its prehensile tail. This species is mainly nocturnal, but may also be crepuscular. It is also said to be bad-tempered, hissing very loudly and deeply. It will raise the front part of its body off the ground in a loop and strike aggressively. E. macmahonii buried in sand. Eristicophis macmahoni can appear to sink down into the sand using a rocking or peristaltic motion. Following this, it will usually shake and rotate its head along the longitudinal axis to cover its head, leaving only its snout and eyes free of sand. It is thought that the enlarged nasorostral scales keep sand from entering the nostrils. Diet Eristicophis macmahonii preys upon small lizards, small rodents, and sometimes birds. Mice are held in the mouth until dead, or nearly so. Reproduction The species E. macmahonii is oviparous, laying up to a dozen eggs. These hatch after 6‚Äì8 weeks, with each hatchling being about 6 inches (15 cm) in total length.Mehrtens JM (1987). Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Venom Relatively little data are available regarding the venom of E. macmahonii, but it is regarded as a potentially dangerous species by the United States Navy (1991) with venom similar to that of snakes of the genus Echis.United States Navy (1991). Poisonous Snakes of the World. New York: United States Government/Dover Publications Inc. 203 pp. .

It is being superseded by the Kh-31. The NATO reporting name is \\"Kilter\\". Development The Bereznyak design bureau had developed the liquid-fuelled Kh-28 (AS-9 ‚ÄòKyle‚Äô) and the KSR-5P (AS-6) anti-radiation missiles. They merged with Raduga in 1967, so Raduga was given the contract in the early 1970s to develop a solid-fuel successor to the Kh-28 to equip the new Su-24M 'Fencer-D' attack aircraft. Consequently, the project was initially designated the Kh-24, before becoming the Kh-58. During the 1980s a longer-range variant was developed, the Kh-58U, with lock-on-after- launch capability. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Raduga have offered several versions for export. Design It was designed to be used in conjunction with the Su-24's L-086A \\"Fantasmagoria A\\" or L-086B \\"Fantasmagoria B\\" target acquisition system. The range achieved depends heavily on the launch altitude, thus the original Kh-58 has a range of 36 km from low level, 120 km from , and 160 km from . Like other Soviet missiles of the time, the Kh-58 could be fitted with a range of seeker heads designed to target specific air defence radars such as MIM-14 Nike-Hercules or MIM-104 Patriot. Operational history The Kh-58 was deployed in 1982 on the Su-24M 'Fencer D' in Soviet service. The Kh-58U entered service in 1991 on the Su-24M and Mig-25BM 'Foxbat-F'. The Kh-58E version can be carried on the Su-22M4 and Su-25TK as well, while the Kh-58UshE appears to be intended for Chinese Su-30MKK's.

Fossils of the genus have been found in Africa, Asia, Europe and North and South America. Its first discovery and naming was found by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1859. Hyperodapedon was a herbivore that used its beaked premaxilla and hindlimbs to dig for plants in dry land.  Description  Life reconstruction of H. sanjuanensis Hyperodapedon was a heavily built, stocky, animal around in length. Apart from its beak, it had several rows of heavy teeth on each side of the upper jaw, and a single row on each side of the lower jaw, creating a powerful chopping action when it ate. It is believed to have been herbivorous, feeding mainly on seed ferns, and died out when these plants became extinct at the end of the Triassic. The diagnosis of Hyperodapedon relies on many features of the cranial and postcranial traits which include a longer than wide basipterygoid process, a crest-shaped maxillary cross section next to the main longitudinal groove, deep excavated neural arches on the mid dorsal vertebrae, a long scapular blade, a pronounced deltopectoral crest, and a proximal humeral end which is broader at the distal end. The maxillary tooth plates are easily seen in Hyperodapedon and there are seven cranial, six postcranial, and three dentition synapomorphy traits. Hyperodapedon had jaws that allowed them to have a precision-shear bite to break down the tough plants that they ate. The beak-like premaxilla and hind limbs were used for digging up food. Teeth along the maxilla and dentary had open roots which could not be replaced like other reptiles. The forelimbs, on the other hand, were used for movement due to the rotation of; the humerus, however, the femur was not able to rotate. Another unique feature of Hyperodapedon was the large eyes with sclerotic plates, which allowed for good sense of vision. They had large nasal capsules to sense smell. Since Hyperodapedon lacked a tympanum, it was believed that they could sense sound by the skin near the quadrate.Benton, M. (1983). The Triassic reptile Hyperodapedon from Elgin: Functional morphology and relationships. Royal Society. Hyperodapedons also appeared to have transverse rows of cone- shaped teeth along the lateral area of the maxilla.Huxley, T. (1887). Further Observations upon Hyperodapedon gordoni. Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, 43, 675-694. Hyperodapedon's closest relative is Rhynchosaurus, and they both share a synapomorphy that the dentary is half the length of the lower jaw.Benton, M. J. (1990). The Species of Rhynchosaurus, A Rhynchosaur (Reptilia, Diapsida) from the Middle Triassic of England. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 328(1247), 213-306. doi:10.1098/rstb.1990.0114 Hyperodapedon had a longitudinal stapedial canal on the posterior side of the spatulate paroccipital process which the lagenar crest extended laterally to limit the posterior end.Langer, M. C., & Schultz, C. L. (2003). A New Species Of The Late Triassic Rhynchosaur Hyperodapedon From The Santa Maria Formation Of South Brazil. Wiley Online Library, 43(4). Above the ventral margin of the orbit was the upper temporal bar which faced dorsally. A non-directional exploitation of morphospace from smaller ancestors with a smaller size restriction is responsible for a large body size in Hyperodapedon. Hyperodapedon have a single row of teeth in mandible bites between their two rows of teeth fixed to a plate which is formed by a union of the maxilla with the palatine. Other key traits are the two maxillary grooves and a single dentary blade, along with missing the infraorbital foramen. The supraoccipital and opisthotics are fused together. Hyperodapedon had a pair of ridges which are absent on the pterygoid, they are missing the palatal dentition, and the prefrontal is concave deeply on the dorsal side.  Discovery  Reconstruction The first discovery was from Thomas Henry Huxley in 1859, who named Hyperodapedon gordoni in honor of Rev. Dr. Gordon's contributions in Elgin County.Burckhardt, R. (1900). I.‚ÄîOn Hyperodapedon gordoni. Geological Magazine,7(12), 529. doi:10.1017/s0016756800183529 T.H. Huxley found many series of subcylindical palatal teeth which was the main trait of Hyperodapedon. Huxley was able to distinguish Hyperodapedon from Rhynchosaurus articeps by the maxillary tooth rows. Later on, Lydekker realized that Hyperodapedon have more than two rows of teeth in both the maxilla and palatine. The type species of Scaphonyx (meaning canoe claw), Scaphonyx fischeri that was once thought to be a dinosaur, is now known to be based on dubious material and therefore should be a nomen dubium. The name Paradapedon was elected for the Indian species H. huxleyi (Lydekker, 1881). Benton, 1983, concluded that this rhynchosaur should be considered a species of Hyperodapedon. Hyperodapedon is known from several species and has been found in many areas of the world, due to the continents being joined together in the supercontinent Pangaea during the Triassic. Fossils from the various species have been identified from Argentina, Brazil, India, Scotland, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and possibly from Canada, and Wyoming (United States).  Classification  H. huxleyi (formerly Paradapedon) Langer et al. (2000) defined Hyperodapedon as a stem-based taxon that includes all rhynchosaurs closer to Hyperodapedon gordoni than to \\"Scaphonyx\\" sulcognathus (now Teyumbaita). The cladogram below follows their phylogenetic analysis of Mukherjee & Ray (2014).Mukherjee, D., Ray, S. (2014), A new Hyperodapedon (Archosauromorpha, Rhynchosauria) from the Upper Triassic of India: implications for rhynchosaur phylogeny. Palaeontology. doi: 10.1111/pala.12113 Valid species that were first assigned to Scaphonyx. A quantitative phylogenetic analysis found a paraphyletic genus Rhynchosaurus, with Rhynchosaurus brodiei more closely related to hyperodapedontines than to Rhynchosaurus articeps. Hyperodapedon is the most commonly found tetrapod along the oldest dinosaur lineage which results in a broad biostratigraphic correlation.Ezcurra, M. D., Montefeltro, F., & Butler, R. J. (2016). The Early Evolution of Rhynchosaurs. Front. Ecol Rhynchosaurs are archosauromorph diapsids which is believed to Trilophosaurus, and sister group to Prolacetiformes and Archosauria. A cladistic analysis of Rhynchosauria reveals that Hyperodapedontinae is a major subgroup of the late Triassic. Stenaulorychus and Rhynchosaurus are close outgroups to Hyperdapedontinae during the middle Triassic. They share the synapomorphy of the dentary is well over half the length of the lower jaw. Rhynchosaurs were basal archosauromorphs that were herbivorous on dry land in Triassic Pangea. Some rare forms are Mesosuchus and Howesia. Hyperodapedon and Scaphonyx are included in the subfamily of Hyperodapedontinae.Huxley, T. (1869). On Hyperodapedon. Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, 25, 138-152. Hyperodapedontinae consist of Hyperodapedon huxleyi and Scaphonyx sulcognathus.  Palaeoecology  A late 19th century illustration of Mastodonsaurus and Hyperodapedon in their environment Hyperodapedon are commonly found in aeolian sand in Elgin, India, Brazil, and Argentina. They are a widely distributed tetrapod during the Upper Triassic and are present in locations where phytosaurs are absent. Hyperodapedon localities are found in the Popo Agie Formation in Wyoming and the Wolfville Formation in Nova Scotia that date to the Otischalkian. They are also found in Scotland in the Lossiemouth Sandstone dating to the Adamanian, Maleri Formation in India, Pebbly Arkose Formation in Zimbabwe, Isalo II Beds in Madagascar, Ischigualasto Formation in Argentina, and Santa Maria Formation in Brazil that vary between Otischalkian and Adamanian.Lucas, S. G. (2002). The Hyperodapedon Biochron, Late Triassic of Pangea. Albertiana. Similarly, Rhynchosaurus is found in fluvial-intertidal deposits with desiccation along with aeolian deposits with common flash floods.Benton, M. J. (1990).

Course The river has its headwaters on the north slopes of McAfee Peak in the Independence Mountains of northeastern Nevada. It quickly exits the mountains and turns southward for approximately , joining its waters with numerous other streams. Making a sharp bend to the east, it flows through a small gorge called Devil's Gap, and then combines with Beaver Creek before resuming its southward course. The river, often with no more than a trickle of water left after its long journey through the dry hills of north-central Elko County, finally flows into the main branch of the Humboldt River about northeast of the city of Elko. History The North Fork watershed is remote. Some mining activity in the area took place in about 1870, followed by cattle ranching, and later sheep ranching in the 1890s. Problems of overgrazing and erosion in the Independence Mountains, which form the headwaters of the North Fork, prompted the federal government to establish the Independence Forest Reserve in 1906. This reserve has since been incorporated into the Mountain City Ranger District of the Humboldt- Toiyabe National Forest. North Fork of the Humboldt River at Devil's Gap.

Mass The Benedictine Order never had a rite of its own celebrating Mass. Since the reform of Pope Pius V (see Quo primum), it always uses the Roman Rite of Mass; earlier, its monks often used local rites, as did those who served the cathedral of Durham. Liturgy of the Hours However, the Order has always had its own form of celebrating the Liturgy of the Hours, in accordance with what was called the Breviarium Monasticum. The founder, St. Benedict devotes thirteen chapters (8-20) of his rule to regulating the canonical hours for his monks (and nuns). Chapter 18 specifies how they should pray the psalms: > :In What Order the Psalms Are to Be Said Let this verse be said: \\"Incline > unto my aid, O God; O Lord, make haste to help me,\\" and the \\"Glory be to the > Father\\" then the hymn proper to each Hour. Then at Prime on Sunday four > sections of Psalm 118 are to be said; and at each of the remaining Hours, > that is Terce, Sext and None, three sections of the same Psalm 118. At Prime > on Monday let three Psalms be said, namely Psalms 1, 2 and 6. And so each > day at Prime until Sunday let three Psalms be said in numerical order, to > Psalm 19, but with Psalms 9 and 17 each divided into two parts. Thus it > comes about that the Night Office on Sunday always begins with Psalm 20. At > Terce, Sext and None on Monday let the nine remaining sections of Psalm 118 > be said, three at each of these Hours. Psalm 118 having been completed, > therefore, on two days, Sunday and Monday, let the nine Psalms from Psalm > 119 to Psalm 127 be said at Terce, Sext and None, three at each Hour, > beginning with Tuesday. And let these same Psalms be repeated every day > until Sunday at the same Hours, while the arrangement of hymns, lessons and > versesis kept the same on all days; and thus Prime on Sunday will always > begin with Psalm 118. Vespers are to be sung with four Psalms every day. > These shall begin with Psalm 109 and go on to Psalm 147, omitting those > which are set apart for other Hours; that is to say that with the exception > of Psalms 117 to 127 and Psalms 133 and 142, all the rest of these are to be > said at Vespers. And since there are three Psalms too few, let the longer > ones of the above number be divided, namely Psalms 138, 143 and 144. But let > Psalm 116 because of its brevity be joined to Psalm 115. The order of the > Vesper Psalms being thus settled, let the rest of the Hour - lesson, > responsory, hymn, verse and canticle - be carried out as we prescribed > above. At Compline the same Psalms are to be repeated every day, namely > Psalms 4, 90 and 133. The order of psalmody for the day Hours being thus > arranged, let all the remaining Psalms be equally distributed among the > seven Night Offices by dividing the longer Psalms among them and assigning > twelve Psalms to each night. We strongly recommend, however, that if this > distribution of the Psalms is displeasing to anyone, he/she should arrange > them otherwise, in whatever way she/he considers better, but taking care in > any case that the Psalter with its full number of 150 Psalms be chanted > every week and begun again every Sunday at the Night Office.

May we, lukewarm that we are, perform it at least in a > whole week! St. Benedict thus wished the entire Psalter to be recited each week; twelve psalms to be said at Matins when there were but two Nocturns; when there was a third Nocturn, it was to be composed of three divisions of a canticle, there being in this latter case always twelve lessons. Three psalms or divisions of psalms were appointed for Prime, the Little Hours and Compline (in this latter hour the \\"Nunc dimittis\\" was never said), and always four psalms for Vespers. Many minor divisions and directions were given in St. Benedict's Rule. Influence The Psalter in the Breviarium Monasticum formed the basis of most forms of the Liturgy of the Hours until the Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X in 1911. Benedictines may not substitute the Roman Liturgy of the Hours for the Monastic Breviary, because their obligation is to say the longer monastic form. In fact, the Benedictine Liturgy of the Hours would occupy some four to five hours of a monk's day; with gradual and sometimes intense elaboration, the daily office at one point grew to where it was absorbing an astonishing ten to twelve hours, especially on the most important feasts. Reform was, obviously, a frequent refrain in those orders who split away from traditional Benedictine monasticism.Celebrating the Liturgy's Books.

The series was told from the point of view of Mark Hollander, a British teenager who is enlisted as the sidekick of superhero of Ace Lightning and do battle against Lord Fear and his minions. The series combined live actors with computer animated characters. Protagonists The series' protagonists were its principle teenage cast, and a group of superheroes known as the Lightning Knights, who come from the game world the Sixth Dimension. The main character is Mark Hollander, who shares the role of protagonist with Ace Lightning. =Teenage Protagonists= * Mark Hollander (Thomas Wansey): The main protagonist and point of view character, Mark is a 13-year-old British teenager who moves to Conestoga Hill in the United States with his parents. His life is turned upside-down when a bolt of lightning strikes his house, and the characters from his game come to life. He reluctantly agrees to be a sidekick to Ace Lightning, whom he develops a strong, trusting friendship with. Mark wears the central piece of the Amulet of Zoar as a necklace. He juggles the two sides to his life, which has severe effects on his grades and social life. He wants to return to normality, but displays bravery and daring around the villains. He dates Samantha Thompson through half the first season, and then Heather Hoffs, but both break up with him due to his constant excuses when running off to help Ace. In the second season, he falls in love with Kat Adams, but remains on good terms with Samantha. He lacks superpowers, but gains his own arm-mounted gauntlet which can fire out lightning. * Chuck Mugel (Marc Minardi): Mark's best friend. An overweight, jovial nerd and avid fan of the game, Chuck has an optimistic view on life and would like to beat the game. He is often bullied by Wayne Fisgus, and has a nasty habit of projectile vomiting. However, he is very intelligent, constructing his own working robot to win a science competition. He dates Wayne's cousin Jessica towards the end of the first season. He becomes Ace's secondary sidekick in the second season, wears glasses, and works as a delivery boy for Rick Hummel. Chuck provides his computer technical skills and knowledge of the game to upgrade Ace and Sparx. * Samantha Thompson (Shadia Simmons): Mark's next door neighbour and girlfriend for most of the first season. She is a popular girl in school, is a cheerleader, and dates Brett Ramirez early in the series but breaks up with him to date Mark, though they remain friends. Samantha is a pragmatic, sensible and forward girl who has a determined attitude. She is fascinated Mark's odd behaviour and pursues an answer, though never gets one. They break up after a disguised Lady Illusion ruins their relationship, though by the end of the first season they reunite. However, Samantha goes to a boarding school in the second season and dates a boy named Jeremy. She returns home and supports Mark dating Kat, ending their romance on good terms. * Kat Adams (Ashley Leggat): The lead heroine of the second season, Kat replaces Samantha after she moves to a boarding school. Kat moves into town with her parents but is not thrilled to leave the city life and considers running away. She can be moody, brash, and argumentative, but is chatty and inquisitive, pursuing a career as editor of the school newspaper. She strikes up a friendship with Mark, perplexed by his odd behaviour and they eventually start dating. She shows talent in playing basketball and commonly wears flatcaps. She decides to investigate the mysterious events in the carnival, and discovers the existence of Ace and co., taken prisoner by the villains in the finale but is rescued by Mark. =Lightning Knights= The heroes of the video game, the Lightning Knights are a group of superheroes who guard the Sixth Dimension from evil. The Lightning Knights operate from the Thunder Tower, an unoccupied observatory in Conestoga Hills. They need to constantly recharge their energy using a transformer or will fade away back to the Sixth Dimension. The Lightning Knights search for the Amulet of Zoar's fragments, a triangular- shaped magic artefact which can open portals and summon characters from the game. * Ace Lightning (Michael Riley): The titular hero of the series and the main hero of the video game. Ace is 32 years old, and has a courageous and witty demeanour, but is confused by the human world. Early in the series, he often enters Mark's house and destroys appliancs after accidentally turning them on. He is able to fly, has superhuman strength, and can project blasts of lightning from the wrist cannons he wears. In combat, he can wield the Lightning Lance, and the Shield of Justice which can absorb an attack and redirect it. In the second season, he gains a new pyrokinetic ability called \\"Ring of Flame\\". As the series progresses, he develops more a personality and begins secretly dating Lady Illusion. In the second season, Lady Illusion infects Ace with actual human emotions, destroying his original programming, and making him emotionally unstable. However, he manages to adapt and develops an intuition that Kilobyte is controlled by someone. In the last episode, he discovers that he is from the video game, but Mark brings him around. He and Lord Fear join forces and banish Kilobyte to the Sixth Dimension, only for Lord Fear to mortally wound him. It is revealed that the wounded Ace is Lady Illusion in disguise, the real Ace chasing off Lord Fear. Lady Illusion dies in Ace's arms, with Ace expressing sorrow with a single tear. * Sparx (Deborah O'Dell): A young, enthusiastic Lightning Knight, Sparx is summoned midway through the first season by Mark, but her arrogant and rude attitude causes him to briefly quit the hero business. Sparx is a very gung-ho hero, often charging into battle without a plan, leading to her defeat and capture. Hot- headed, fearless, but loyal to her friends, Sparx is a skilled gymnast and martial artist. She wields the double-edged Sword of Jacob which can emit pink-coloured lightning, and travels around on the Lightning Flash, an aircraft resembling a jetski. She has an aggressive rivalry with Lady Illusion throughout the series. * Random Virus (Cathal J. Dodd): A 35-year-old cyborg who is Ace's old friend and teammate. Six years prior to the game's storyline, Random was wounded in an accident of some kind that cost him much of his body and damaged his programming. His new body included caterpillar tracks for legs and a large claw in place of his right arm. Random has a split personality with a good and evil side that interswitched, based on the colour of his right eye (red being evil, green being good). His good side fears he will harm his friends, so he hides away in Conestoga Hills' junkyard, while his evil side wants to wipe out everything he considers weak like kindness and heroes. Ace and Lord Fear often vie to recruit him, though he can go so out of control that the two join forces to defeat him. Random was summoned by Dirty Rat using two stolen Amulet pieces. His cybernetic parts allow him superhuman strength and power over machinery. Antagonists The villains of Ace Lightning, referred to as the \\"Evil Gang\\" in some materials all originate from the Sixth Dimension, save Kilobyte. Led by Lord Fear, the villains operate in the Carnival of Doom, an eerie amusement park. Their goal is to conquer the world using the Amulet of Zoar, though Lord Fear would prefer to destroy the human world. Unlike the Lightning Knights, the villains are blasted into an item located around the carnival that symbolise them, until they recover and emerge again. In the show, they take over the rundown Kent Bros. Carnival. * Lord Fear (Juan Chioran): The main antagonist of the series, Lord Fear is Ace's nemesis. A 352-year-old lich, Lord Fear is an intelligent but temperamental supervillain who wants to take over the world. He is able to extend his neck and arms like a boa constrictor, and is a powerful magician. He was accidentally crippled by Ace years ago, walking with a limp, and he uses his minion Staff Head as a walking stick and weapon. In his spare time, he plays a pipe organ in the carnival's haunted house and miniature golf. He has a romantic relationship with Lady Illusion, referring to her as \\"snookums\\", but she has an affair with Ace that is exposed at the end of the first season. He is defeated after Mark breaks the Amulet, but returns in the second season where his position of power is usurped by Kilobyte. He torments Lady Illusion throughout the season. Kilobyte gives Lord Fear a mode of transport called the Doom Wagon, a motorcycle-hovercraft with a chainsaw mounted on the hood. In the series finale, he joins forces with Ace to defeat Kilobyte but turns against him, mortally wounding Lady Illusion before going on the run. * Staff Head (Michael Lamport): Lord's Fear loyal minion, Staff Head is a frog-like gargoyle who sits on the end of a bone-shaped stick holding a crystal ball than can shoot energy blasts. He received a character redesign in the second season, becoming an actual frog. He speaks with a Cockney accent, and has a snobbish, cruel personality. He learns of Lady Illusion's relationship with Ace and blackmails her to serve Lord Fear in exchange for his silence. * Kilobyte (Ted Atherton): The main antagonist of the second season, Kilobyte is known as the Cyber Stalker, and was created by Rick Hummel to defeat Ace and prove his genius. Kilobyte is a bald, tattooed man who can extend four octopus tentacles from his back, which can absorb another character's energy or even upgrade them with new powers as he does with Lady Illusion, giving her the ability to infect Ace with human emotions. He has a cold, grim mind who thinks like a hunter and plots to destroy Ace slowly and painfully. He materializes from the carnival's ferris wheel. Needing a mode of transport, Kilobyte allows a wasp to sting him and take on his powers, causing it to mutate into a giant which Kilobyte can fly on. Kilobyte names it Fred, and is the only character he shows genuine affection for. Kilobtye is eventually freed of Rick's control, and plots to remove humanity from the world and trap them in the game. Ace and Lord Fear join forces and blast Kilobyte into the Sixth Dimension, where he plots to use the imprisoned Rick to escape and return to the real world. * Lady Illusion (Tamara Bernier Evans): Lady Illusion is introduced as Lord Fear's evil partner and lover. A green-skinned, elf-like woman with an actual spider for hair, she is able to shapeshift into any person or animal. She can also teleport, create bombs resembling crystal balls, and has spider-like agility and reflexes. At first she is obedient and quiet, but quickly grows to hate Earth and strikes out on her own. She is found by Ace, and they quickly fall in love, keeping their relationship a secret with only Mark knowing. Staff Head witnesses Lady Illusion kissing Ace, and blackmails her into stealing Mark's Amulet pieces. She ultimately betrays Lord Fear for Ace in the season one finale. In the second season, she is left behind by Ace when he returns to game, leading her to believe he has abandoned her, so she returns to Lord Fear and steals the Amulet pieces from Mark's house, disguised as a housekeeper named Felicity Fury. Kilobyte gives her the ability to infect Ace with human emotions, which she later comes to regret. Her loyalties are tested throughout the season, until she disguises herself as Ace in the finale and is mortally wounded by Lord Fear after defeating Kilobyte, dying in Ace's arms. * Anvil (Howard Jerome): The muscle of the group, Anvil is an anthropomorphic rhinoceros dressed in medieval-styled clothes and has a large anvil in place of a right hand. Anvil speaks in third person, is not very intelligent, and has a short temper. He possesses superhuman strength and is on par with Ace when it comes to physical power. However, he is afraid of the dark and becomes cowardly. He is often seen in the company of Pigface. Anvil materializes from the carnival's high striker game. * Pigface (Keith Knight): A grotesque anthropomorphic boar or warthog, Pigface is 12 years old and a common enemy of Ace. He is able to devour anything, and despite his weight, is fast and strong. He gains an ability to fire a spray of snot from his nose in the second season. Pigface is childlike, unintelligent, and is often seen eating anything he can, usually from the carnival's trash cans. He is sensitive to Ace's wisecracks, and often the first to attack and be defeated. Pigface materializes from a trash can in the carnival. * Dirty Rat (Adrian Truss): A winged rat dressed as a clown, Dirty Rat acts as Lord Fear's spy, and is the most recurring antagonist after Lord Fear. Sneaky and deceptive, Dirty Rat enjoys spying on others, but is cowardly by nature, hiding behind other antagonists during battles or avoiding conflict all together. Along with flight, he has enhanced senses of smell and hearing, and can create bombs identical to Lady Illusion's. He materializes from a gargoyle that sits outside the haunted house. He strikes up a friendship with Duff Kent, and enjoys Earth's technology. Lord Fear often abuses him, to the point he starts a rebellion against him after he obtains the last piece of the Amulet, but rejoins Lord Fear when he obtains the other fragments. He becomes Kilobyte's minion, but is abused by him as well. In the finale, Dirty Rat flees the carnival with Lord Fear after Kilobyte's defeat. * Googler (Richard Binsley): A 33-year-old insane, maniacal jester, Googler is summoned by Lord Fear after obtaining an Amulet fragment in the first season's seventh episode \\"Only Human\\". Imprisoned in a place called White Hot Oblivion by Ace, Googler seeks revenge against Ace. He speaks in third person and creates his own vocabulary of words like \\"googlerize\\" (an alternate use of \\"pulverise\\"). He wears a spiked shell on his back, which he can curl into, turning him into a dangerous, fast-moving bouncing ball. Googler wears two talking sock puppets named Zip and Snip (voiced by the series' character designer Matt Ficner), who are able to fly, can chew through any surface, absorb powers, and zombify Ace in one episode. Googler materializes from the carnival's puppet show theatre. * Rotgut (Robert Tinkler): An undead but stereotypical cowboy introduced in the second season, Rotgut is a fairly useless and clumsy villain. His body parts often fall off, forcing Rotgut to crawl around after them. He speaks with a Southern accent, and has a sensitive nature, preferring to be called the \\"walking dead\\" rather than a zombie. He materializes from the carnival's miniature golf course. Rotgut develops a one-sided friendship with Chuck, and stalks him so he can turn him into a zombie. Rotgut shows an ability to possess people, hijacking Chuck's body, forcing Mark to babysit him until he is removed. He becomes friends with Dirty Rat and Duff. * Duff Kent (Philip Williams): The owner of the Kent Bros. Carnival, Duff becomes a slave of Lord Fear after they invade the funfair. He tolerates Lord Fear's presence, often grovelling in front of him for his own safety, and only wants to run his business normally. He forms a close friendship with Dirty Rat, bonding over their misery in life and desire to make money. Duff drives an ice cream truck called the \\"Dairy Wagon\\", which the villains use for transport. Duff rebels against Lord Fear in the season one finale, aiding in the fight against him, but ends up working with him again in the second season, though on a more even level. He refers to the game characters as cartoons. * Giant George Wayne: A large cowboy-like golem who appears in the series' tie-in video game and the second season. In the series, Sparx encounters him when trapped in the game but defeats him with help from Chuck. In the PC and PlayStation 2 version of the game, he acts as part of a boss battle with Dirty Rat. Supporting characters * Pete Burgess (Devon Anderson): Mark's best friend who lives in England. They communicate through webcam messages at the start of most episodes, and he is the first person who learns about Ace Lightning after Mark and Duff. Pete often gives advice to Mark regarding his social life and superhero work. He visits Mark in the first season, but is captured by Lord Fear as a hostage, and decides it would be better to remain as a bystander in the characters' conflict. * Wayne Fisgus (Jorgan Hughes): A teenager in Mark's class who bullies Chuck. He maintains an intimidating attitude but is easily frightened, wears a baseball cap at all times, and refers to Chuck as \\"Upchuck\\" due to his nauseous nature. Wayne's father appears in the first season, being a boastful hunter who exaggerates his adventures in the wild. Wayne often goes looking for Lord Fear, who he refers to as the \\"Bone Man\\", and is frightened by him. * Jessica Fisgus (Megan Park): Wayne's cousin who debuts near the end of the first season. She and Chuck meet at a school gathering of the Ace Lightning fanclub, revealing they have unknowingly been in contact for months under internet aliases. They start dating in the second season, Jessica wishing for a sturdy relationship and often refer to Chuck by his full name when he does something wrong. She is talented with computers. * Brett Ramirez (Brandon Carrera): Samantha's boyfriend in the first season. He is a popular boy in school, on the soccer team, and is implied to come from a rich family. He is shown to be a friendly, understanding guy and listens to Samantha when she expresses her concerns for Mark, even after Samantha and he break up. He dates Heather in the second season, putting up with her snobbish attitude, but eventually breaks up with her due to her vendetta against Mark. * Heather Hoffs (Petra Wildgoose): Samantha's best friend. She is a chatty, enthusiastic girl who pursues Mark after Samantha breaks up with him. Heather attends karate lessons, and enjoys martial art films starring Jackie Chan. Heather is not as forgiving towards Mark as Samantha, and dates Brett in the second season. However, she maintains a grudge against Mark, becoming very snobbish and mean til Brett breaks up with her in the season finale. * Simon and Fiona Hollander (Ned Vukovic and Susan Danford): Mark's parents who moved from England to America. Simon is an excitable man who is fascinated by America's gadgets but has a habit of damaging them or ruining his wife's garden with them. He works as an accountant. Fiona works as a real estate agent, and is very protective of her garden, believing something in their life should remain British. She is particularly fond of her garden gnomes. * Ashley Hollander (Kayla Perlmutter): Mark's young cousin. She learns of Ace's existence early on in the series, promising to keep her discovery a secret. In the second season, she wants to get involved in Mark's adventures but is rejected, but she helps Chuck escape from the game world. * Rick Hummel (Brett Heard): A central figure in the second season, Rick Hummel runs a computer repair store in Conestoga Hills and employs Chuck. Rick is actually a programmer on the game who developed an ability to bring the characters to life, only to be mocked and fired from the development company. Beforehand, he programmed the software into one of the game discs, namely the one Mark purchased. He appears in the second season, observing the characters as the Master Programmer, operating from the backroom of his store where he owns a large mainframe that contains the Sixth Dimension. Rick creates Kilobyte after Lord Fear's defeat, intending to use him to defeat Ace and prove to the world of his apparent genius. Mark and Chuck discover Rick's actions, but a blackout causes him to lose control of Kilobyte. Kilobyte then imprisons Rick in the game, where he joins him in the finale, plotting to use him to escape the game world. * Mr. Cheseborough (R.D. Reid): Horace Cheseborough is a science teacher who teaches Mark. He is a grouchy man who has little faith in his students, taking pleasure in marking their daily quizzes incorrectly and wears badges flattering himself. He is kidnapped by Lord Fear as part of a plot to defeat Mark, and replaced temporarily by Lady Illusion. He is released but has his memory erased. However, he recalls his imprisonment and becomes convinced he was abducted by aliens. In the second season, he encounters Lord Fear again, who manipulates him into creating a formula that can drain Ace of his powers. Mark convinces him he has been tricked, and they make an agreement that Mark must protect him from the \\"aliens\\". Kilobyte captures Mr. Cheseborough and traps him in the game, but Chuck manages to free him. Mr. Cheseborough is so terrified he goes on a panicked rampage around the carnival, and is declared a madman by the authorities. * Nettie Kutcher (Diane Douglass): The lunchlady at the middle school, Mrs. Kutcher is very motherly towards Chuck, often creating for him special meals since he is the only one who appreciates her cooking. * Coach (David Huband): The unnamed gym teacher and soccer team coach at the middle school. He strives to train his team well, is easily impressed, but a bit bumbling at times. He is a secret fan of Ace Lightning.

Throughout a long career he was an eminent researcher, writer, teacher, administrator and organiser, who had a profound effect on the development of African Studies in the United Kingdom.  Biography  Oliver was born in Srinagar, Kashmir, India in 1923. Following his undergraduate and doctoral studies at the University of Cambridge between 1941 and 1948, Roland Oliver joined the staff of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at the University of London, where he was successively Lecturer, Reader and Professor until his retirement in 1986. His appointment as a Lecturer in African history marked the beginnings of the contemporary academic field of African history. The African History Seminar that he founded and chaired at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) became the most important venue for the advancement of the academic discipline of African history anywhere in the world, and has profoundly influenced all subsequent scholarship on the subject. He travelled extensively throughout Africa in 1949-50 and 1957-58 and visited the continent almost every year since then. In 1953, 1957 and 1961 he organised international conferences on African history and archaeology, which did much to establish the subject as an academic discipline. He was a founding editor, with John Fage, in 1960 of the Journal of African History and, again with John Fage, in 1960 of the Cambridge History of Africa which appeared in eight volumes between 1975 and 1986. In 1963, he carried out a survey of 250 working Africanist academics in the United Kingdom and founded the African Studies Association of the UK (ASAUK) itself. He became its fourth President in 1966-67. Oliver was Visiting Professor at the University of Brussels (1961), Northwestern University (1962), and Harvard University (1967). From 1979 to 1993 he was president of the British Institute in Eastern Africa. The Cambridge History of Africa, and his influential Oxford History of East Africa, were produced in a decade between the late 1970s and late 1980s. These histories recognised and celebrated the long, rich history of Africa, which for the first half of the 20th Century was previously thought by historians to have only a history \\"created\\" by white travellers, administrators and settlers. In 2004, Oliver was awarded the Distinguished Africanist Award of the African Studies Association of the UK (ASAUK) and in 1993 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. He died on 9 February 2014 at the age of 90 in Frilsham, Berkshire, England.http://www.royalafricansociety.org/analysis/obituary-roland-oliver  Books  *The Missionary Factor in East Africa, 1952. *Sir Harry Johnston and the Scramble for Africa, 1957. *A Short History of Africa (with John Fage), 1962, 6th edition 1988. *Africa since 1800 (with Anthony Atmore) 1967. *Africa in the Iron Age (with Brian Fagan) 1975. *The African Middle Ages (with Anthony Atmore) 1981. *The African Experience: From Olduvai Gorge to the 21st Century, 1991, Revised 1999. *In the Realms of Gold: Pioneering in African History, 1997.

During his life, he served as a military commander, feudal lord, historian, and playwright. He is also remembered as a great tea connoisseur, a zither player, and composer. Other names In addition to Prince of Ning, Zhu Quan was also known as the Strange Scholar of the Great Ming (, Da Ming Qi Shi). As part of his Taoist attempts to avoid death, he adopted the aliases the Emaciated Immortal (, Q√∫xiƒÅn), the \\"Master who Encompasses Emptiness\\" (, H√°nx≈´zi), \\"Taoist of the Mysterious Continent\\" or \\" Taoist of the Mysterious Island\\" (, Xu√°nzh≈çu D√†oren), and \\"Perfected Gentleman of the Marvelous Way of the Unfathomable Emptiness of the Southern Pole\\" (, N√°nj√≠ Ch≈çngx≈´ Mi√†od√†o Zhƒìnj≈´n). History Zhu Quan was initially a military commander in service to his father, the Hongwu Emperor who founded the Ming dynasty. He was granted the frontier fief of Ning with his capital at Daning in present-day Chifeng, Inner Mongolia in 1391. He was famous for his mastery of art and war and played an important role during the unrest surrounding the ascension of his teenage nephew, Jianwen Emperor, in 1399. Under the advice of his Confucian advisors, the Jianwen Emperor summoned his uncle to an audience in the imperial capital Nanjing. Wary of the emperor's intentions, as other uncles were demoted or executed the same year, Zhu Quan refused and lost three of his divisions for insubordination. Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, was preparing for his own uprising against the emperor and considered it a major point to neutralize Zhu Quan, a talented leader of well-trained troops located behind his lines. Taking advantage of Wu Gao's attack on Yongping near modern Shanhaiguan, the Prince of Yan after crushing Wu Gao's force rode hastily to Daning and feigned defeat and distress. After several days, his forces were in position and successfully captured Zhu Quan as he was seeing his brother off. The official history of the Ming records Daning's evacuation, with Zhu Quan's harem and courtiers removed to Songtingguan and the prince himself kept in the Yan capital at Beiping, but passes over Zhu Di's setting of the entire city to the torch and the destruction of Zhu Quan's extensive library.Wang, Richard G. The Ming Prince and Daoism: Institutional Patronage of an Elite. Oxford Univ. Press, 2012. . Accessed 14 Oct 2012. From that point, Zhu Quan assisted his brother in his uprising, with the History of Ming recording that the Prince of Yan offered to split the entire empire between them. After his elevation as the Yongle Emperor in 1402, however, he swiftly reneged and refused to appoint his brother to lordship over Suzhou or Qiantang, instead giving him a choice only of backwater appointments. He settled upon Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi. After a scare where he was accused of practicing wugu sorcery,A kind of Chinese black magic where poisonous insects were kept together in a small container until only the deadliest was left. The last surviving insect was then burned and used in the preparation of a potion. Zhu Quan essentially retired from any interference with the realm, devoting his time instead to cultural pursuits.\\"Zhu Quan\\". History of Ming, Folio 117, p.14a. Taiwan ed, p. 3591. Accessed 14 Oct 2012. Meeting daily with local or visiting scholars, he pursued immortality. He treasured and revised his Secret Book of Origins (, Yu√°nsh«ê M√¨sh≈´), a text which survived the fire of Daning and sharply attacked Buddhism as a foreign \\"mourning cult\\" at odds with Chinese culture and proper governance. His encyclopedia of Taoism, the Most Pure and Precious Books on the Way of August Heaven (, TiƒÅnhu√°ng Zh√¨d√†o T√†iqƒ´ngy√π C√®), was so esteemed it joined the Taoist canon. His brother ordered him to complete the Comprehensive Mirror of Extensive Essays (Tongjian Bolun) and was also credited with writing Family Advice (Jia Xun), Ceremonial Customs of the Country of Ning (Ningguo Yifan), The Secret History of the Han and Tang (, H√†n-T√°ng M√¨sh«ê), History Breaks Off (Shi Duan), a Book of Essays (, W√©n P«î), a Book of Poetry (, Shƒ´ P«î), and several other annotated anthologies. His most successful was his Tea Manual (, Ch√° P«î). In addition, he personally funded the publication of many rare books and composed several operas. Zhu Quan is an important figure in the history of the Chinese zither, or guqin, for his compilation of the important Manual of the Mysterious and Marvellous (, Sh√©nq√≠ M√¨ P«î) in 1425.

Levitate became the last album to feature two long-time Fall members, drummer Karl Burns and bass player Steve Hanley (whose playing was once described by Smith as the defining element of the group's music). The album remained out of print for a long time, as Artful went bankrupt in the early 2000. An expanded, remastered 2CD/3LP version of the album was released by Cherry Red Records in May 2018. Recording background Levitate was recorded amidst a difficult period for the group, described by personnel turmoil and financial troubles due to a VAT bill incurred in the 1980s and early 1990s for nearly ¬£200,000. Simon Wolstencroft left after a disagreement about the recording of 'Everybody But Myself'; also having received financial advice about the group's VAT bill, he resigned from being a co-director of The Fall business. Karl Burns was fired in 1995 after the recording of The Light User Syndrome but reluctantly brought back in during the recording of Levitate, after Simon Wolstencroft left. Julia Nagle programmed computers using Logic Audio software, played guitar and keyboards on most of Levitate, and contributed vocals on songs \\"Doc Shanley's Quartet\\", \\"I'm A Mummy\\" and \\"Scareball\\". Her young son Basil contributed a spoken part on 'The Masquerade'. The album was initially going to be produced by Keir Stewart and Simon Spencer (who previously collaborated with Smith under the moniker D.O.S.E. on the 1995 single \\"Plug Myself In\\"). Most of the recordings took place at Edwyn Collins's studio in West Hampstead. However, Stewart and Spencer soon fell out with Smith over payments and left after a week, taking most of the tapes with them. The only tracks from these sessions to make the album were \\"4¬Ω Inch\\" (allegedly edited out of samples of a rehearsal recording), \\"Spencer\\", later re-dubbed by Smith as \\"Spencer Must Die\\", and \\"The Quartet of Doc Shanley\\". Scottish artist Tommy Crooks joined the group towards the end of recording Levitate, playing guitar. The album features several covers ‚Äì \\"I'm a Mummy\\" by Bob McFadden & Dor and \\"Jungle Rock\\" by Hank Mizell, as well as an interpretation of the song \\"I Come and Stand At Every Door\\", based on a poem by Nazƒ±m Hikmet and a traditional tune, previously performed by Pete Seeger, The Misunderstood and The Byrds (\\"Jap Kid\\" is an instrumental version of this track). Another track, \\"Tragic Days\\", is a poorly recorded fragment of a jam session at Martin Bramah's flat back in 1990, when Bramah still played in The Fall. \\"Masquerade\\" was re-recorded from the album version and released as a single in February 1998 to coincide with the group's leader Mark E. Smith receiving the Godlike Genius award at the NME Awards. It reached number 69 in the UK charts. The \\"Masquerade\\" sessions also produced a b-side \\"Calendar\\", a collaboration with then-unknown Damon Gough (aka Badly Drawn Boy) which came about after a chance meeting when Smith allegedly mistook Gough's car for a taxi outside the pub. The album was followed by another shambolic tour. Smith sacked the whole group in Ireland in November, although they were re-instated within days. The situation was caused by the group's sudden debt crisis because of the VAT bill, which left Smith and Steve Hanley in danger of their houses being repossessed. It was during the US tour in 1998 that the group essentially fell apart, leaving Smith with only Nagle's support in rebuilding the group for their next album The Marshall Suite.

They formed in California, United States, in 1992. The core members of the group are ambient musician Robert Rich and guitarist/bassist Rick Davies. Rich and Davies have worked together since 1979. Davies had just returned to the United States after working with several experimental rock groups in the United Kingdom and Spain. During the next five years, Rich and Davies worked on several collaborative projects. The style of these projects was an aggressive blend of art rock and pure avant-garde composition. In 1983 Rich and Davies formed a trio with bassist Andrew McGowan called Urdu. Urdu performed several concerts in the San Francisco Bay Area. One of their last performances was a live radio broadcast in 1984. Some of their recorded material was released as a self-titled album on cassette in 1985. In 1992 the first version of Amoeba formed. It was a quartet featuring Robert Rich, Andrew McGowan, guitarist David Hahn and drummer Matt Isaacson. They released a five- song EP-CD in 1993 titled Eye Catching. This lineup dissolved soon after the release of Eye Catching. In 1994 Rick Davies came to Rich with some of his new musical ideas. They were slow folk inspired pop compositions with strong ambient sensibilities. They decided to incorporate these ideas into a new version of Amoeba. This lineup featured Rich on vocals, synthesizers, percussion, lap steel guitar and flutes and Davies on guitars and bass. They developed a style consisting of slow, hypnotic and largely acoustic pop compositions and Rich's classic ambient textures and acoustic recordings. Their lyrics range from abstract to darkly emotional. This form of Amoeba has released two albums, Watchful (1997) and Pivot (2000). Each of these albums features a number of guest performers including cellist and multi- instrumentalist Hans Christian. After the release of Pivot Davies went on to pursue his solo career in Tucson, Arizona. Rich continues to release ambient solo albums and tour at a prolific rate. Both musicians continue to hold a future Amoeba project as a possibility, though there are difficulties due to the geographic distance between them.

His father, son of William Duff of Dipple, co. Banff, was M.P. for Banffshire 1727‚Äì34, was created Lord Braco in the peerage of Ireland 28 July 1735, and was advanced to the dignity of Earl of Fife and Viscount Macduff, also in the peerage of Ireland, by patent dated 26 April 1759, on proving his descent from Macduff, Earl of Fife.. Politics In 1754 he became Member of Parliament for Banffshire, was re-elected in 1761, 1768, 1774, and 1780, and in 1784 elected to represent Elginshire until 1790. He gave the Banff town of Macduff its name, having changed it from Doune in 1783. He extended the town and built a harbour at a cost of ¬£5,000 ensuring economic prosperity. Duff was one of the most powerful and influential men in Aberdeenshire, Banffshire and Morayshire due to his massive estate. Due to his political commitments in Westminster, the running of the Estate was largely left to his factors - in particular William Rose of Ballivant. For his service to Duff, Rose was awarded many political favours. First, Duff gave Rose a vote in three different constituencies (Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, Morayshire), he appointed him the first Provost of Macduff, and latterly the Sheriff Clerk of Banffshire. He was created a British peer by the title of Baron Fife, 19 February 1790. He held the appointment of lord-lieutenant of county Banff. Estates He succeeded his father in the title and estates in September 1763, and devoted himself to the improvement of the property, which he largely increased by the purchase of land in the north of Scotland. He was twice awarded the gold medal of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, for his plantations, with which he covered fourteen thousand acres. He offered the farmers on his estate every inducement to cultivate their land on the most approved principles, and himself set the example by instituting near each of his seats a model farm, where agriculture and cattle-breeding were carried on under his personal supervision. In 1782 and 1783, when all crops failed, he allowed his highland tenants a reduction of twenty per cent. on their rents, and disposed of grain to the poor considerably below the market price, importing several cargoes from England, which he sold at a loss of ¬£3,000. In 1787 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Family James Duff married on 5 June 1759, Lady Dorothea Sinclair, only child of Alexander, ninth earl of Caithness, but he had no issue, and his British peerage became extinct on his death. He was succeeded in his Irish earldom by his next brother, Alexander. However he had three children by his mother's personal maid, Margaret Adam of Keith, all of whom were born before his marriage to Sinclair. Death He died at his home, Fife House, Whitehall, London, on 24 January 1809, and was buried in the mausoleum at Duff House, Banffshire.

Although an F2 tornado did hit the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station in Ohio on 24 June 1998 resulting in the loss of off-site power, and this appears to be the inspiration for the film, the film bears no resemblance to the actual events at Davis-Besse. The film originally premiered on TBS Superstation on June 9, 2002. Plot A series of tornadoes in West Tennessee cripple the Hellman-Klein Nuclear Power Plant by damaging a power transformer and a generator. This leaves the plant with very little power to operate. As an operator shuts down non-vital systems, which include the electric pumps, a second tornado hits the plant, damaging the diesel pumps. Meanwhile, Campbell Maguire (Daniel Costello), the plant supervisor's young son, is caught in the twisters. His babysitter is killed and he runs away towards the plant on his bike. When the diesel pumps fail, the staff try to restart the electric pumps, but they won't respond. The nuclear reactor overheats, causing coolant to evaporate from the waste pool, threatening to expose radioactive material. The staff attempt to initiate SCRAM procedures to try to shut down the nuclear reactor, but the computer fails to respond. An operator named Neville goes in to manually shut down the reactor, but is exposed to large amounts of radiation. He is successful, though, and the reactor is shut down, although he is presumably fatally injured by the radiation. Coolant is still rapidly evaporating from the waste pool, meaning the radioactive material will be exposed in half an hour. A local police officer named Jake (Mark-Paul Gosselaar), a friend of Corrine, searches for Campbell and finds him. Together they make their way to safety at Corinne's request. On the way they discover Jake's girlfriend, Ashley (Charmaine Guest), trapped on a steep hillside in her car. Jake goes down to rescue her. Both Jake and Ashley are nearly killed when her car slides over the cliff but Campbell saves their lives, risking his own to do it when he is given an option to escape. Jake lauds Campbell as a hero and lets a relieved Corrine know of her son's survival and heroism. Firemen spraying water into the pool only slows the evaporation, however a disused diesel generator is found and they plan to hook it up to the electric pumps. They order some diesel fuel for it but the truck driver panics at the idea of driving in the adverse weather. Jake, a former truck driver, intercepts the fleeing truck driver and delivers the diesel to the plant himself. At the plant the heat is starting to prove too much for the firemen and they start to pass out while the water from the hoses is having very little effect. It is mere minutes before the waste pool will be completely exposed. Jake helps the firefighters while Corrine hooks up the fuel and attempts to start the generator. With the generator running the pumps restart and the waste pool starts to refill, and the crisis is averted. The plant is damaged, but stable. Campbell and Corrine are finally reunited as Jake and Ashley set a date to get married. Corrine and Neville look at each other while Corrine holds her son closely. She says \\"thank you\\" to him for his self-sacrifice of his life to shut the reactor down. Neville is led away, eventual fate uncertain although he likely dies of radiation poisoning as the characters said anyone who entered the reactor chamber would get a fatal dose.

Education and career He received his BA from the University of Oxford and his PhD from Princeton University under the direction of Richard Rorty. He taught at Yale University, the University of Maryland, and Northwestern University prior to joining the faculty at Johns Hopkins.http://philosophy.jhu.edu/directory/michael-williams/ He is married to philosopher and Wittgenstein scholar Meredith Williams, a recently retired member of the Johns Hopkins philosophy faculty. In 2007, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.http://pages.jh.edu/news_info/news/home07/may07/williams.html Philosophical work Williams is best known as an epistemologist, but he also has significant interest in the philosophy of language, Wittgenstein, and the history of modern philosophy. Other scholars know him particularly for his work on philosophical skepticism. In his books (1992) and (2001), Williams performs what he calls a \\"theoretical diagnosis\\" of skepticism, according to which the soundness of skepticism presupposes a realist view of knowledge itself; that is, skepticism presupposes that knowledge is a context-invariant entity rather like a natural kind. By dispensing with this realist assumption that distinguishes the epistemological context from other contexts, the skeptical argument becomes unsound and can therefore be rejected. With this solution to the skeptical problem, Williams thereby defends a contextualist view of knowledge, but one that differs considerably from other contextualists such as Stewart Cohen and Keith DeRose. In addition to working on skepticism as a theoretical problem, Williams has a strong interest in the historical development of the skeptical tradition and defends the view that skeptical arguments in modern and contemporary philosophy differ in fundamental ways from similar or related arguments developed in antiquity. Williams in his article entitled Why (Wittgensteinian) contextualism is not relativism? makes a distinction between Wittgenstein's contextualism and relativism. He argues that the first doctrine does not consider the agent's system of epistemic beliefs, whereas the latter considers it. The author postulates that the absolute justification in this system is refutable. He purposes to explain why the rejection of absolute justification does not raise objections to relativism. Considering that the set of epistemic beliefs are found in a system in a justified way, even if we suppose that this system of beliefs is coherent, one can have the problem of the circularity of justifications. Williams makes a distinction between inferential justification and non- inferential justification.

Modeled, like other Union and Confederate infantry regiments, on the French Zouaves of Crimean War fame, its tactics and uniforms were different from those of the standard infantry. Even the uniforms of the 5th New York's were modeled closely on those of French Zouaves: a dark blue Zouave jacket with red trim, a dark blue shirt with red trim, a red Zouave sash with sky blue trim, extremely baggy red pantaloons, a red fez with a yellow tassel, white gaiters and leather jambi√®res (\\"leggings\\"). The 165th New York Volunteer Infantry was regarded as a sister regiment and known as the \\"Second Battalion, Duryee Zouaves\\". The 165th wore the same uniform as the 5th with the exception of the tassel of the fez, which was dark blue instead of yellow-gold. Photographic evidence suggests that later in the war the 165th was given replacement sashes that were a solid red color without the light blue trim. Formation Duryea Zouaves, Regimental Mess, Fort Schuyler, May 18, 1861 The regiment was formed on April 12, 1861, by a group of military enthusiasts in Manhattan and deployed from Fort Schuyler at Throgs Neck, New York Harbor.The Zouaves at Fort Schuylers, The New York Times, May 5, 1861. Colonel Abram Dury√©e was appointed as the commander of the regiment. The majority of the soldiers were educated and above average height. On May 24, the regiment boarded a transport to reach the Virginia Peninsula. Immediately at Fort Monroe, the regiment began making scouting expeditions. By the end of May, the regiment moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where they built and garrisoned an earthen fort at the summit of Federal Hill. Dury√©e was promoted to general rank, so Gouverneur Kemble Warren took over command of the regiment.https://catalog.archives.gov/id/92309027 There, the regiment continuously drilled, until General George McClellan ordered the regiment to join the Army of the Potomac in the campaign to capture Richmond, Virginia. McClellan said that, upon seeing the colorful New York regiment, \\"the Fifth is the best disciplined and soldierly regiment in the Army.\\" Fighting Big Bethel, in a sketch by Thomas Nast. At the Battle of Hanover Courthouse on May 27, 1862, the regiment played only a minor role. However, they fought in a more major role in the Battle of Gaines' Mill of the Seven Days Battles. As McClellan moved his base to the James River on June 27, 1862, the regiment fought against Gregg‚Äôs South Carolina brigade. In a counterattack, the regiment defeated the initial Rebel attack. In August 1862, the regiment fell under the control of General John Pope. At the Second Battle of Bull Run (also known as the Second Battle of Manassas), the 5th New York Volunteer Infantry regiment was forced to withstand the advancing forces of General James Longstreet. In underestimating the size of the Confederate army, Pope ordered the regiment to support Hazlett‚Äôs Battery. Longstreet‚Äôs soldiers easily outnumbered the small regiment, and the Texas Brigade quickly inflicted over 330 casualties in the regiment. One hundred twenty Zouaves were killed within eight minutes, the greatest single battle fatality of all Federal volunteer infantry regiments in the entire Civil War. The entire Color Guard was killed, except for one man. The only officer to survive the battle was Captain Cleveland Winslow. Later, at the Battle of Antietam, September 17, the unit was held in reserve. On December 15, the unit fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg, covering the Union retreat. At the Battle of Chancellorsville under Joseph Hooker, the unit saw its final combat. In the fall of 1862, officers of the 5th detailed on recruiting duty had organized the 165th New York Volunteer Infantry, or \\"Second Battalion Duryee's Zouaves.\\" The 165th served with the 19th Corps in Louisiana, in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, and on occupation duty in Charleston, South Carolina, at war's end.http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/civil/infantry/165thInf/165thInfMain.htm Colonel Cleveland Winslow of the 5th organized the 5th New York Veteran Volunteer Infantry after the original 5th mustered out. After a long and difficult recruiting period, the 5th Veterans joined the V Corps and fought in the final campaigns of the Virginia front.http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/civil/infantry/5thInfVet/5thInfVetMain.htm Legacy The memorial of the 5th New York Volunteer Infantry, erected at Manassas September 29, 1906. Following the conclusion of the war, members of the 5th New York Veterans Association continued to hold monthly meetings. The veterans' association funded the creation of a statue to General Warren, their first commander, on Little Round Top at Gettysburg. They also erected a monument to the regiment at the scene of their greatest sacrifice on the battlefield of Second Bull Run (Manassas). The association was also contributed to a monument to the Army of the Potomac's 5th Corps in Fredericksburg National Cemetery in Virginia.

Biography James was the elder son of the Hon. Alexander Duff, who succeeded his brother as third Earl Fife in 1809. He was educated at Edinburgh and was not intended for the army. On 9 September 1799 he married Mary Caroline Manners (second daughter of John Manners and Louisa Tollemache, 7th Countess of Dysart), who died on 20 December 1805 without children. Thereupon Duff sought distraction in 1808 by volunteering to join the Spaniards in their war against Napoleon. His assistance was gladly received, especially as he came full of enthusiasm and with a full purse, and he was made a major-general in the Spanish service. He served with great distinction at the battle of Talavera, where he was severely wounded in trying to rally the Spanish runaways, and was only saved from becoming a prisoner by the gallantry of his lifelong friend, Major (afterwards Lieutenant-general Sir) S. F. Whittingham. In that year, 1809, he became Viscount Macduff on his father's accession to the Irish earldom of Fife, but he still continued to serve in Spain, and was present during the defence of Cadiz against Marshal Victor, and was again severely wounded in the attack on Fort Matagorda in 1810. On 17 April 1811 he succeeded his father as fourth Earl Fife, and as Lord Lieutenant of Banffshire, and returned to Britain, after being made for his services a knight of the order of St. Ferdinand. He was elected M.P. for Banffshire in 1818, and made a lord in waiting in the following year. He was created Baron Fife in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 27 April 1827, in which year he was also made a knight of the Thistle. He soon afterwards retired altogether to Scotland, where he lived at Duff House, Banffshire, much beloved by his tenantry and greatly interested in farming and cattle raising, and there he died, aged 80, on 9 March 1857. His influence was instrumental in the passage of Jos√© de San Martin -a Spanish captain at this time- to South America in 1812, who would freed Argentina, Chile and Per√∫ of the Spanish rule. In 1824 the General Jos√© de San Martin -today national hero of Argentina and Per√∫- visited him at Duff House (see external link below). He was succeeded by his nephew, James Duff, the elder son of his only brother, General the Hon. Sir Alexander Duff, G.C.H., who was a most distinguished officer, and commanded the 88th regiment, the Connaught Rangers, from 1798 to 1810, serving at its head in Baird's expedition from India to Egypt in 1801, and in the attack on Buenos Ayres in 1806, and who had predeceased the 4th Earl in 1851.

It started operation in November 2002 at Metro do Porto stations and is now a cross-network ticket used on the Porto Metro, selected bus and train routes and the Funicular dos Guindais cable railway. Two types of card are currently in use: *Occasional or Azul (blue): This card is a rechargeable ticket intended for occasional riders, and contains a small, flexible memory card within the laminated ticket. The card has an estimated life-span of about one year. *Season or Gold: Similar to a credit card in shape and material, it has a memory chip on the surface. Gold tickets also feature the holder's name and laser-scanned photograph. It has a life-time of several years. Occasional tickets can be bought at the terminals in stations. Ticket machines can recharge both kinds of ticket, although Gold tickets can only be purchased in Lojas Andante (Andante Shops). Tickets can also be recharged at MultiBanco ATMs. When purchasing tickets, passengers must select how many zones the card will allow travel within. The minimum Z2 (2 zone) ticket allows travel for 1 hour after validation, with allowed travel time increasing for each valid zone purchased. Unlike others ticket zoning systems, Andante zones are not concentric. This makes the system slightly fairer, but also slightly more complicated. To travel within the same zone or up to one neighbouring zone you need Z2 ticket, the more zones you need to cross, the higher the Z ticket you need. Although with Andante Occasional you can use your tickets in any zones, with Andante Gold you must choose in advance which zones you will be travelling in. The system uses ISO/IEC 14443 type B for communication between card readers (check-in points, automatic vending machines, vending stores and controller handsets) and the card itself. The system is entirely contactless, with validation activated by holding the ticket a short distance in front of the reader for about a second. Teams of ticket inspectors make random checks across the network with hand-held ticket readers.

Vang is a former municipality in Hedmark county, Norway. Vang was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city of Hamar was separated from Vang in 1849. Furnes was separated from Vang in 1891. Vang was merged with Hamar on 1 January 1992. Prior to the merger of Hamar its administration center was located in Hamar (i.e., outside of its own municipality). Vang had 9,103 residents and an area of 327 km2. There was strong local opposition -- a referendum held 22 and 23 April 1990 showed 95% of the Vang residents opposed incorporation into Hamar, with a 64,7% turnout. Support in Hamar was stronger as Vang was a prosperous farming municipality, while Hamar suffered from urban decay. The sponsor for the consolidation was Odd Aspeli (of the Arbeiderpartiet). He took over as Mayor in Hamar after consolidation and remained as Mayor until 1999. Another chief sponsor against consolidation, Einar Busterud, then assumed the position of Mayor. G√•sbu Ski Center lies in Vang Almenning, and has served as the backup venue for the Holmenkollrennene.The Holmenkollen ski arena has been described as the cradle of all Nordic ski competition, with more than 112 years of international ski competition. The national cross-country skiing championship was last held here in 2002. The name The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old farm Vang (Old Norse: Vangr, \\"field\\" or \\"meadow\\"), since the first church was built there. √òvre Vang is the common local name for the area outside Hamar that used to be the now merged municipality Vang, Hedmark. Early history Archeological evidence provides ties between the Vendel era culture in Uppland and Vang in the period from 600 to 800 AD. Most notable is finding of a fine examples of a Vendel Culture style ring sword in Vang burial mounds; each sword's hilt is adorned with a heavy gold ring upon which oaths were sworn.The use of the ring sword is also mentioned in Beowulf and the Eddas. √Öker g√•rd (Aaker farm) in Vang was the site of an ancient Thing (ting) place; it was there that Magnus I agreed to share power with his uncle Harald Hardr√•de and the two became co-rulers. In the 11th century the Thing was moved to Eidsvol. It remained a king's farm during the Viking period, as well as a local headquarters for the military. At the end of the Hannibal War General Georg von Reichwein was granted √Öker g√•rd as his residence. During the following years it continued to be the residence of senior military officers. J√∏rgen Otto Brockenhuus, founder of the Brockenhuss ‚ÄìSchack family, resided there in the early 18th century. The 19th century Vang municipality was established in 1837, when the municipality law came into effect. The municipality borders were those which had been established by a border commission in 1730. It was named after Vang church; since the early Iron Age the region had been known as Ridabu. In 1847 the executive council majority agreed that Hamar should be restored to city status, but the decision was controversial and some believed the basis for the decision was illogical. When Hamar achieved city status in 1849 0.4 km2 of land was reassigned to it from Vang. Vang gave up additional land to Hamar in 1878, 1946, 1947 and 1965. In 1891 the district of Furnes was separated from Vang to create a municipality of its own. The earliest village was Hjellum - a contraction of ¬´Hjellum-by\`n¬ª. It was there that the train station for the R√∏rosbanen line between Elverum and Hamar stopped. In the same place Sanderud asylum (now hospital) was located. During the Second World War, especially after 1944, many resistance fighters hid in Vangs√•sa. About 70 persons found refuge in the Norwegian resistance Milorg's district 77 rural huts. On 26 October, German troops assaulted one of the huts and two resistance fighters were killed. A third escaped miraculously. After 1947 the √òstland District Commandos had their headquarters at √Öker g√•rd. After the Second World War more villages developed: Ridabu, Ingeberg, Vangli and Wik.

It was originally intended to have flanking pavilions linked by colonnaded quadrants but these were never completed. David Bryce Junior was later commissioned to provide a 3-storey pavilion and corridor block, but this was damaged by a bomb in 1941 and subsequently demolished. The Earls of Fife moved out of Duff House in 1903, gifting the property to Banff Burgh in 1906.

Within each house there are designated positions of a sports prefect, performing arts prefect and a charities prefect. Structure of the school There are six forms per year group, denoted by their house initials, A, C, F, P, R and S- Austen (red),Curie(green), Franklin(Blue) Parks(yellow) Rossetti(Purple) and Shelley(light blue) (prior to 2006 they were denoted using the number system and prior to 1997 they were denoted A, alpha, B, Beta, P and pi). This switches in Year 9and then are furthur mixed in year 10,at the start of GCSEs, from having lessons with the form, to having lessons with a teaching group. For this, 2-5 students from each form are allocated, alphabetically, into a new teaching group. This remains the same for all core lessons (maths, sciences, English), and special groups according to choices are made for each student's individual choice of languages, humanities and arts. On Friday afternoon, year 11 have options in PE that include yoga and kickboxing. On a Wednesday afternoon the Sixth form have a Complementary Activities block in which many outside PE classes are run, including yoga, golf, urban funk and basketball. Students also spend time on work experience placements and doing work in the local community. House system Since September 2006 a House system was reimplemented (it had existed when the school was located at the Landsdown site, before moving to its current position on Castle Lane). The Houses were named after influential women with assigned house colours, as follows: Jane Austen (red), Marie Curie (green), Rosalind Franklin (blue), Rosa Parks (yellow), Christina Rossetti (purple) and Mary Shelley (turquoise). The emblem of the school is a snowdrop, which features on all the House badges. Productions The school has an award-winning handbell team, who have played at the Royal Albert Hall. Every other year the school performs a musical which involve the whole school. In recent years these have been West Side Story, Les Mis√©rables, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, Little Shop of Horrors, The Sound of Music, and Grease and Hairspray. The girls also participate in Bournemouth School's productions such as Bugsy Malone, Jesus Christ Superstar, and in 2014, a musical written by sixth form students based upon Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. In the years where a musical is not performed, members of staff participate in a staff pantomime, with all proceeds going to charity. Other extra curricular activities Bournemouth School for Girls enters teams every year in the Mock Trial Competition, MACE debating, ESU public speaking, Rotary public speaking and Schools' Challenge competitions. There are also friendly debates fortnightly between BSG and BS, held in Bournemouth School's lecture theatre at lunchtime. There is a lower school debating competition sponsored by local solicitors, HG Walker. Also running are sports clubs for table tennis, a gym club, trampolining and ultimate frisbee; as well as Junior Drama club, History club, Science club, and various support clubs for students having difficulty with subjects. There is also now a comedy club, and in 2011, the Science club won a competition called \\"seeITgrow\\" run by the IT company Viglen, gaining first place in the tallest sunflower category for secondary schools with a height of 3 metres. A small group of students have also recently sent off their entry for Kid Witness News, an international documentary competition for schools. Sport Sports are an important part at Bournemouth School for Girls, which was recognised when in 2012, the school was selected by LloydsTSB to be a part of the National Olympic Torch Relay, in which 10 pupils carried an Olympic torch through Bournemouth. =CCF= The school also has an active Combined Cadet Force, a rarity for a state-funded school. The CCF currently has over 150 members from both Bournemouth School and Bournemouth School for girls. The CCF is run mostly by senior cadets in the 6th forms at both schools. The CCF is open to pupils in year 9 (age 13) upwards with an annual recruitment usually in February. The CCF is split into three sections; Army, Navy and RAF. Each has its own uniform (Green for the Army, Royal Blue for the RAF and Navy Blue for the Navy). The structure follows a military system, with four senior cadets, four section ICs and other ranks, including Flight Sargeant, Private, Sniper and Wingman. Activities that cadets are able to take part in include gliding, flying, shooting, the Ten Tors walk, national exchanges and camps including Penhale central camp in the summer term. There is also a Band section that rehearses every week, also run by sixth form cadets, with each member choosing which uniform they wish to wear according to the section they want to be affiliated with. Ofsted Bournemouth School for Girls has won praise from Inspectors following their recent visits, achieving 'Outstanding' in all aspects of school life in October 2012. Inspectors noted 'the very good teaching and good leadership at all levels that enable pupils to achieve very well and develop into confident young adults.' They comment that 'staff are knowledgeable and supportive; they transfer their love of learning to the pupils and help them to achieve very well.' Pupils at the school also come in for high praise, not only for 'their very high levels of determination to succeed' but also for their 'exemplary behaviour'. The sixth form is described as ‚Äòhighly effective'. 'Provision is very good in academic subjects and for students' personal development.'

Named Wikolia Kamehamalu Keawenui Ka ªahumanu-a-Kek≈´ana≈ç ªa and also named Kalehelani Kiheahealani, she was mainly referred to as Victoria KamƒÅmalu or Ka ªahumanu IV, when addressing her as the Kuhina Nui.  Family  Born at the Honolulu Fort, on November 1, 1838, she was the only daughter of Elizabeth Kƒ´na ªu (Ka ªahumanu II) and her third husband Mataio Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa. Through her mother she was granddaughter of King Kamehameha I, founder of the united Hawaiian Kingdom. Her two brothers would later become kings of Hawaii as Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V. She was named after her maternal aunt Queen KamƒÅmalu, the consort of Kamehameha II, who died in London from the measles. The Christian name Victoria was after Queen Victoria and signified the close friendship of the British monarchs and the Hawaiian monarchs. Having given away her previous four sons, Kƒ´na ªu refused to give her only remaining daughter in hƒÅnai to John Adams Kuakini who wanted to take her to be raised on the Big Island. Kƒ´na ªu defied the customs of the time and personally nursed her daughter. Kƒ´na ªu died from the mumps a few months after Victoria's birth. She would become the highest female chief in Hawaii at the time. Her kahu (attendants) were John Papa  ªƒ™ ªƒ´ and his wife Sarai. They later accompanied Victoria to school due to her age.  Early life  Victoria KamƒÅmalu and her father Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa Victoria was educated at Chiefs' Children's School (later renamed Royal School) along with all her cousins and brothers. Along with her other classmates, she was chosen by Kamehameha III to be eligible for the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii. She was expected from birth to one day succeed to the position of Kuhina Nui if not the office of monarch, so she was educated by the Cookes with full attention to what political roles she might play in the near future. In the school, the students were permitted to visit with relatives from time to time. When the students fell ill, their kahu and families went to the school and stayed for a while to attend to them. Victoria's kahu, John Papa  ªƒ™ ªƒ´, was eventually appointed kahu for all of the students at the Chief's Children's School and visited in that capacity, though his political services were in such demand by the court that he was often absent. Victoria's father Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa raised her. He was the royal governor of Oahu. In Honolulu her father built her a Greek-revival mansion which was the largest house in the town of Honolulu, or anywhere in Hawaii, at the time. Her father was in debt to foreigners, however, so Kamehameha III bought the palace from him. He made it his royal palace and called it Hale Ali ªi (House of the Chiefs) and it was the first  ªIolani Palace. Victoria was two months younger than the future queen Lili ªuokalani. At her birth, the High Chiefess Laura K≈çnia went to Kƒ´na ªu with her adoptive daughter Lili ªu. Kƒ´na ªu would nurse Lili ªu while handing her own daughter to a nurse. According to Lili ªuokalani, both girls would share everything from a young age and when Victoria visited her aunt KekƒÅuluohi, Lili ªuokalani would be invited too. Victoria was destined from a young age to become a sovereign like her siblings, but it would be Lili ªuokalani who would later become the first Queen of Hawaii due to Victoria's early death. Bernice Pauahi Bishop, another classmate at the Royal School, was hƒÅnai to Kƒ´na ªu and Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa. Originally betrothed to Victoria's brother Lot, Pauahi married American businessman Charles Reed Bishop on May 4, 1850 against the wishes of her biological parents PƒÅkƒ´ and K≈çnia and Victoria's father. A year later, in August 1851, the twelve year-old Victoria helped reconciled Pauahi with her parents and Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa.  Kuhina Nui  Personal Flag of Princess Victoria KamƒÅmalu as Kuhina Nui It was intended that Victoria would succeed her mother Kƒ´na ªu in the position of Kuhina Nui (premier), but her mother died while she was still an infant. Her aunt KekƒÅuluohi became a place-holder for her niece using the name Ka ªahumanu III, but she died when Victoria was seven. Subsequently her uncle Kamehameha III appointed John Kalaipaihala Young II, also known as Keoni Ana, the son of John Young, as Kuhina Nui. Princess Victoria KamƒÅmalu was appointed as Heiress Presumptive to the title of Kuhina Nui in 1850, to be the successor to Keoni Ana. Since 1845, by legislative act, the office of Kuhina Nui had been joined with that of the Minister of the Interior. Given her young age, it was clear to the King, Privy Council, and Legislative Council that Victoria was not suited to be Minister of the Interior. Therefore, on January 6, 1855, an act was passed to repeal the earlier legislation. In 1854, her uncle Kamehameha III died and her brother Alexander Liholiho succeeded him as King Kamehameha IV. According to Robert Crichton Wyllie, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and a trusted friend of the royal family, opponents of the new king were planning to overthrow him and place his sister Princess Victoria on the throne instead. However, the conspiracy never culminated in anything. She became Kuhina Nui in 1855 mainly due to her brother's ascension to the throne after the death of her uncle. It is probable that Kamehameha III had meant for Keoni Ana to hold the office until his death; Keoni Ana did retain the role of Minister of the Interior. Victoria presided over the King's Privy Council. In 1862, Victoria and her brother Lot were officially added to the line of succession in an amendment to the 1852 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Lot and his heirs, follow by Princess Victoria and her heirs, would succeed in the case their brother died without any legitimate heirs. The change was made shortly before the death of Prince Albert Kamehameha, the only son of Kamehameha IV, on August 23, 1862. Victoria constitutionally assumed the power of state for a day when her brother Kamehameha IV died leaving no designated heirs in 1864. Section II Article 47 of the 1852 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom provided that the Kuhina Nui (Premier), in absence of a monarch, would fill the vacant office. > Whenever the throne shall become vacant by reason of the King's death, or > otherwise, and during the minority of any heir to the throne, the Kuhina > Nui, for the time being, shall, during such vacancy or minority, perform all > the duties incumbent on the King, and shall have and exercise all the > powers, which by this Constitution are vested in the King. After consulting with the Privy Councilors, she proclaimed in front the Legislature: > It having pleased Almighty God to close the earthly career of King > Kamehameha IV, at a quarter past 9 o'clock this morning, I, as Kuhina Nui, > by and with the advice of the Privy Council of State hereby proclaim Prince > Lot Kamehameha, King of Hawaii, under the style and title of Kamehameha V. > God preserve the King!  Betrothal  Princess Victoria (right) socializing with other members of the royal court. Victoria was betrothed to William Charles Lunalilo. Their parents had planned out their marriage from infancy and it was popular among the Hawaiians. The date was set, but they were forbidden to marry by her brothers Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V, and the wedding was cancelled. The reason was because the children of Victoria and Lunalilo would have a higher rank or mana than the brothers' own lines. In fact Kamehameha IV had tried to split them apart by engaging Victoria to David KalƒÅkaua, and Lunalilo to Lydia Kamaka ªeha.  Scandal  In 1857, a scandal involved Victoria and Marcus Cummins Monsarrat (1828‚Äì1870), a married English auctioneer. Monsarrat had been a friend to her two brothers and was a frequent dinner guest. One night, Prince Lot was informed that Monsarrat was in the Princess' bedroom. He immediately went to her room and caught him in the act of \\"arranging his pantaloons\\". The enraged Prince told him to leave or he would kill him. When Kamehameha IV found out about the incident, he blamed Lot for not \\"shooting Monsarrat down like a dog.\\" As Kuhina Nui she actually had to sign the papers that would banish Monsarrat from Hawai ªi: > Whereas, Marcus C. Monsarrat, a naturalized subject of this Kingdom, is > guilty of having perpetuated a grievous injury to Ourselves and to Our Royal > family, And Whereas, such injury is of such a character as in Our judgement, > to authorize and require the expulsion of the said M. C. Monsarrat from Our > Dominions...Now, therefore, know that We, in the exercise of the Power > vested in Us by virtue of Our office as Sovereign of this Kingdom...do > hereby order that the said Marcus C. Monsarrat be forthwith expelled from > this Kingdom; and he is hereby strictly prohibited forever, from returning > to any part of Our Dominions, under penalty of Death. Monsarrat did, in fact, return and the King had him imprisoned and exiled again. Often accounted as Princess Victoria KamƒÅmalu's misbehavior and a love affair between the two, the contemporaneous Charles de Varigny defended the princess by saying Monsarrat's \\"insolence reached a point at which the princess was obliged to cry for help\\".; Her brother attempted to marry her to KalƒÅkaua. For the last few years of her life, she was rarely seen in public. She remained a spinster for the remaining part of her life.  Crown Princess  Princess Victoria in 1865, photographed by Charles L. Weed Victoria was an expected heir to the throne throughout her life because both her brothers were unable to leave surviving issue of their own. In fact, she was appointed as Heiress Apparent and crown princess by her brother King Kamehameha V in 1863. She would have become queen of Hawaii upon her brother's death, but she predeceased him. Considered pro-American, the princess had a close friendship with the American missionaries. Musically gifted, she was an accomplished pianist and vocalist, and she sat at the melodeon and led the choir of Kawaiahao Church for many years. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Robert Crichton Wyllie, considered it improper that a royal princess would sing in a choir and tried to convince her to stop, but she stayed loyal to the American missionaries at Kawaiahao. When the royal family switched from the Congregational Calvinist faith to the Anglican Church of Hawaii (originally known as the Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church), Victoria refused to abandon her previous faith. She was also a poet and chanter and composed chants and mele in the traditional Hawaiian style including many on her nephew Prince Albert Kamehameha. In 1863, Victoria founded the Ka ªahumanu Society, an organization concerned with the welfare of the ill and elderly Hawaiians, originally to nurse the victims of the smallpox epidemic.  Death  KamƒÅmalu became ill during a party given at the Bishop's residence in HaleƒÅkala, Honolulu, in February 1866. The illness continued and resulted in paralysis in early May. She became bedridden for the last three weeks of her life. The physicians Seth Porter Ford and Ferdinand William Hutchison were consulted although not much hope was given to her recovery. Her brother Lot wrote to Queen Emma who was abroad in Europe at the time, \\"But thanks to a vigorous constitution and still young, she has rallied\\", and he wished Emma would see Victoria alive when she returned. The princess was suffering from much pain, swelling in the body, and was unable to move without assistance. She was nursed by her ladies-in-waiting Nancy Sumner and Lili ªuokalani. The Honolulu English language newspaper The Pacific Commercial Advertiser reported, \\"On Sunday she was better, but her disease took an unfavorable turn soon after\\". KamƒÅmalu did not recover and died at 10 a.m. on May 29, 1866, at Papakanene house at Moku ªaikaua, at the age of 27. The exact illness that caused her death has never been discussed in detail. The official statement was that she died \\"imprudently bathing while heated\\". Mark Twain was in Honolulu at the time and wrote favorably of her in his public correspondence to the Sacramento Daily Union. However, privately in his notebook, he wrote, \\"Pr. V. died in forcing abortion ‚Äî kept half a dozen bucks to do her washing, & has suffered 7 abortions\\" and later described how she kept a harem of \\"thirty-six splendidly built young native men\\" who were present at her funeral. Victoria's childless death left her brother the king without obvious heirs. Her brother, a bachelor throughout his life, had intended that she should be his heir. Her death left her brother without an obvious successor. After his brother's death in 1872 an election was held between KalƒÅkaua and Lunalilo, both former suitors of the princess. Lunalilo easily won the election, yet his reign lasted less than a year. Victoria died without a written will, so her vast landholdings, including much of the original private lands of her mother and Queen Ka ªahumanu, were inherited by her father and eventually passed to her half- sister Ke ªelik≈çlani who willed them to Bernice Pauahi Bishop and from whence they became part of the Kamehameha Schools. The Ka ªahumanu Society went to the wayside after her death, but Lucy Kaopaulu Peabody reorganized the club in 1905, and it continues to this day. Funeral Illustrations of Hawaiian funeral rites during Princess' lifetime, from Roughing It, a book chronicling Twain's travels. The Legislature had to raise $6,000 for her funeral expenses including a coffin made from fine kou and koa wood. Her funeral ceremony also revived many funeral rites of the Native Hawaiians including the kanikau (grief wailing) and public hula performances. The wailing lasted for weeks. Many loyal Hawaiians walked as far as 50 miles to pay their last respects to their princess. Writing in high revolutionary fervor of the days immediately following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Professor William DeWitt Alexander remarked: > It is true that the germs of many evils of Kalakaua's reign may be traced to > the reign of Kamehameha V. The reactionary policy of that monarch is well > known. Under him the \\"recrudescence\\" of heathenism commenced, as evidenced > by the Pagan orgies at the funeral of his sister Victoria KamƒÅmalu, in June, > 1866, and his encouragement of lascivious hula hula dancers and the > pernicious class of Kahunas or sorcerers. Closely connected with this > reaction was a growing jealousy and hatred of foreigners. Mark Twain, a spectator to the events, also labeled the acts of the grieving Hawaiians as \\"pagan orgies.\\" Twain had his letters sent to his newspaper in Sacramento and he later published his observations in the book Roughing It. He didn't understand that for the last years of the Princess' life, she had become disillusioned with Western modernization and retreated to the ancient Hawaiian traditions, and the funeral ceremonies were her brother's way of honoring her dying wishes.

In 1939, Williams married Jessie Wanda Crupe, a singer who soon adopted the stage name Chickie Williams (February 13, 1919 - November 18, 2007). The Williams' were popular performers. Although the couple and their band the Border Riders recorded, performed live and appeared on the radio for over five decades, they never had a national hit.

He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise on 24 June 1999. He grew up in Paris, studying at the Lyc√©e Condorcet before being mobilised for the army in 1940. Taken prisoner, he was sent to Stalag VIII C (in Sagan). He was then sent to the lighter making area in Kransdyhernfurt on the 26 June 1940, then to a commando at Auras-sur-Oder to clear a forest. Even in the worst moments of this ordeal, he kept his special sense of humour. He was repatriated in 1944. He began his career in 1960, thanks to Jacques Vilar, who presented his first major play, \\"G√©nousie,\\" at the Th√©√¢tre national populaire. This was followed by Le Satyre de la Villette, with Andr√© Barsacq at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Atelier, a comedy which ranked him with his literary forebears Jacques Audiberti, Ionesco, Beckett. He has been, for more than fifty years, one of the most-produced French playwrights on the planet, as well as the most internationally renowned (having been translated into 28 languages). Critics have admired the remarkable ease of Obaldia's style. His plays always take place within a framework of contemporary times and concern modern subjects, treating these in a comical manner. In La G√©nousie, for example, Obaldia replaces normal speech (in French) with Genousian, a language of fantasy, dreams, and love. In 1985 he was awarded the Grand Prix du Th√©√¢tre de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie Fran√ßaise.

It was discovered on 8 August 1923, by Soviet astronomer Sergey Belyavsky at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. The asteroid was named after German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Gauss computed the orbit of Ceres, and 1001 Gaussia was named along with 1000 Piazzia, and 1002 Obelersia in part for their work on Ceres, with names for Giuseppe Piazzi, who found Ceres, and Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers, who recovered it later that year.  Orbit and classification  Gaussia is a background asteroid that does not belong to any known asteroid family. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8‚Äì3.6 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,100 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 9¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first identified as at Taunton Observatory () in December 1907. The body's observation arc begins at UNSO in January 1908, more than 15 years prior to its official discovery observation at Simeiz.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Gaussia has an ambiguous spectral type. Its type is closest to the primitive P-type asteroids, followed by the common carbonaceous C-type asteroids. = Rotation period = In November 2005, a rotational lightcurve of Gaussia was obtained from photometric observations. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 20.99 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.11 magnitude (). Lower-rated lightcurves with a divergent period of 4.08 and 9.17 hours were previously obtained in 2005 and 2009, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Gaussia measures between 67.80 and 80.07 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.036 and 0.05. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0417 and a diameter of 74.71 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.7.  Naming  This minor planet was named by Swedish astronomer Bror Ansgar Asplind after Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777‚Äì1855), German mathematician and director of the G√∂ttingen Observatory (), who also rediscovered Ceres using a new orbital computing method by Franz Xaver von Zach. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (). He is also honored by the lunar crater Gauss. 1001 Gaussia was named as part of trio honoring the events surrounding the discovery of Ceres in 1801. Carl Friedrich Gauss who computed the orbit of Ceres was for 1001 Gaussia, 1000 Piazzia for Giuseppe Piazzi and 1002 Olbersia for Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers. Olbers recovered Ceres after it has passed behind the Sun and returned. In the next few years only three more astronomical bodies were found between Mars and Jupiter, Pallas, Juno, and 4 Vesta, however it would be 37 years before another asteroid was found, 5 Astraea in 1845.

Both Drew and Natalie have creative input on Married to the Sea but the comic is not strictly collaborative. Each has a personal webcomic project: Drew is also the author of Toothpaste for Dinner and Natalie Dee produces NatalieDee. There is one new comic on Married to the Sea daily. According to the site, it updates at midnight EST, \\"without exception\\". The comics themselves are composed of public domain images (Victorian or otherwise) combined with new captions written by the authors. Despite its dated appearance, frequent anachronistic references to current events, as well as modern technologies and concepts, make it apparent that the comic itself is being written in the present day. Married to the Sea has been described by New York magazine as \\"brilliant\\" and \\"lowbrow\\". The comic draws its inspiration from many different domains, including popular music and entertainment, science, history, government, politics and philosophy. The intentions of the characters are frequently ambiguous, and their actions and words are frequently (and often bizarrely) at odds with the opinions expressed in actual Victorian-era America. The first Married to the Sea comic was posted online on February 13, 2006. The site now sells several T-shirts and prints based on comics from Married to the Sea'. In March 2012, Drew and Natalie created three new websites full of non-comic content. These are @drewtoothpaste, The Worst Things for Sale, and Stuff I Put on Myself.  NatalieDee NatalieDee is a webcomic created by Natalie Dee Fairweather, one of the authors of Married to the Sea. There is a new comic added daily to NatalieDee.com.

At this point the comic was not regularly updated. The comic began being updated on weekdays from 29 December 2003 and then daily as of 9 May 2005. Since these first comics the overall look of the illustrations has become more professional and polished. Natalie Dee has moved away from paper drawings and now uses software to create her signature hand-drawn style. She sometimes blends photographs or stock imagery with illustration. As of December 5, 2013, NatalieDee.com is no longer being regularly updated. The front page randomly shuffles comics from previous dates. In February 2014, Natalie Dee launched NatalieDeeMachine.com, a random comic generator in the style of classic Natalie Dee comics.

It was greatly changed by the construction of the Ville-Marie Expressway in the 1970s. The square is divided into three sections. It is bordered to the west by Saint Denis Street, to the east by Saint Andr√© Street, to the north by Viger Street and to the south by Saint Antoine Street. History Force sculpture fountain by Claude Th√©berge. In the 1840s, the city of Montreal acquired several parcels of marshland permitting for its development. Trees were planted and pathways were traced. Prior to 1851, a hay market and public scale operated on the site on the east side of Saint Denis Street. The hay market moved a few times on the site, but was always to the east. Viger Square was inaugurated on September 11, 1860. In 1865, greenhouses were added, although were moved to La Fontaine Park in 1889. In 1870, Viger Square was the only public place in Montreal to hear live music. Ernest Lavigne directed his orchestra in Viger Square from 1885 to 1889, before he moved to Sohmer Park. In 1892, to enlarge the square at the request of citizens, the cattle market was demolished near Saint Andr√© St. Some members of the French-Canadian elite moved near the square, which experienced a boom with the construction of prestigious buildings such as Place Viger (700 Saint Antoine Street) by architect Bruce Price in 1898 and the √âcole des hautes √©tudes commerciales (535 Viger Avenue) in 1908-1910. In the mid-20th century, several redevelopment projects were suggested for this vast space. Among them were plans to build a municipal library, an auditorium (to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Montreal in 1942) or to accommodate a large parking lot (in the 1950s). It was the development of road infrastructure that ended up taking over the space. The park was destroyed when the underground Ville-Marie Expressway was built in the 1970s. Once the highway was finished, a new Viger Square was created on its concrete roof in three parts, delimited by Saint- Denis, Berri, Saint-Hubert and Saint-Andr√© Streets. The development of the three sections was entrusted to sculptors Charles Daudelin, Claude Th√©berge and Peter Gnass and was completed in 1985. The artist-run centre Dare-Dare was based in Viger Square from August 2004 to July 2006 and presented more than a dozen exhibitions, events and performances. The main social and entertainment location for non-sporting events during the inaugural 2006 World Outgames was located at the west side of Viger Square. Future plans As it stands now, Viger Square holds little resemblance to what it once was. It is criticized because of the strong presence of concrete structures and especially of homeless people. The Centre hospitalier de l'Universit√© de Montr√©al project will bring many changes to the neighbourhood. Public consultations will take place that will lead a significant restructuring of Viger Square. Jean- Olivier Ch√©nier Monument The Jean-Olivier Ch√©nier Monument on Saint Denis Street, opposite Viger Square. The Jean-Olivier Ch√©nier Monument is a memorial designed by Alfonso Pelzer located on Saint Denis Street opposite Viger Square. A committee created in 1893 authorized the monument on April 24, 1895.

It is included in the Bridgnorth civil parish; the civil parish of Oldbury (covering 817 acres) was abolished in 1967.Vision of Britain Oldbury CP The village remains separated from the town however and has a distinct character. The village is linked to the town by the modern B4363 road, though the original route linking the two settlements is now cut in half by the Bridgnorth by-pass (the A458 road). However, as there is a footbridge crossing the A458 it is still possible for pedestrians and cyclists to follow the old route, which goes up Manor Farm Lane, splits to the right down the hill towards the by-pass, and continues on the Bridgnorth side down Oldbury Wells towards Hollybush Road. The Mercian Way (National Cycle Route 45) follows part of this route, from Manor Farm Lane, over the bypass and then through Oldbury Wells. Oldbury also contains an old church, dedicated to Saint Nicholas, which features beautiful stained-glass windows depicting Biblical scenes, with a west window, dedicated in 1919 as a parish First World War memorial depicting St Alban and St Martin of Tours and accompanied by a wooden board listing 13 men who died serving in that war. From the church there is an old raised pathway across fields towards Bridgnorth, now rarely walked upon though still visible, known traditionally as the \\"Coffin Way\\". Coffins were brought from Bridgnorth by mourners, as at one time they could be buried at St Nicholas's for free whereas there was a fee in Bridgnorth churchyards. The village lies on a notable hillside, which slopes down from Henley Lodge (at 102m above sea level) towards the River Severn, which flows to the east of the village, with the lower parts of the settlement at approximately 60m.

In Hawaiian, her name KekƒÅuluohi means the vine growing with shoots. She adopted her secondary name Auhea, meaning Where, oh where, in memory of the death of Kamehameha I. Life She was born on July 27, 1794, the only daughter of her father High Chief Kalaimamahu (half-brother of Kamehameha I) and her mother KalƒÅkua KaheiheimƒÅlie of Maui, who herself was married Kamehameha I. She was hƒÅnai to (adopted by) her grandparents Namahana and Keeaumoku, who \\"fondled her as if she were a feather lei from the precious mamo bird.\\" Through her mother she was a step-daughter of Kamehameha I, founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and through her father she was a cousin of Kamehameha I. She was also half-sister of KamƒÅmalu and Kƒ´nau. She was betrothed to a prince of the Tahitian P≈çmare Dynasty at birth, but never married him because of the prince's early death. In 1809 she was chosen along with Manono II by Kamehameha I \\"to warm his old age\\". When Kamehameha I died in 1819 she gave herself the name Auhea (where has he gone) in memory of her first husband. She would later marry her cousin Liholiho (who took the throne as King Kamehameha II) as one of his five consorts. She had no children from her first two marriages. And in 1821 was given by Kamehameha II to his friend Charles Kanaina on Kauai in marriage. She became Kuhina Nui of Hawaii on April 5, 1839 and she took the name Kaahumanu III, after the two preceding holders of the office. As Kuhina Nui she signed, with the king, all official documents; conducted all executive business affecting the Crown; received and transferred government lands; and served as special Councilor to the king, with exclusive veto power over his decisions. She and Kamehameha III signed the first constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1840. It provided for an elected representative body, a first step toward the common people gaining political power. She served in the House of Nobles from its founding. The constitution also codified for the first time the responsibilities and authority of the kuhina nui. She held both positions until her death. She and Kanaina had one child. KekƒÅuluohi gave birth to a son January 31, 1835. When a name for the prince was about to be selected, his mother chanted: \\"I luna, i luna, i lunalilo, the highest, the highest, the highest of all\\". Although given the Christian name William Charles, he became King Lunalilo of Hawaii in 1873. KekƒÅuluohi died of influenza at Pohukaina, Honolulu, June 7, 1845. Initially buried in the Pohukaina Tomb, located on grounds of  ªIolani Palace, her remains were not amongst those transported in 1865 to the newly constructed Royal Mausoleum at Mauna  ªAla in the Nu ªuanu Valley.

The earning yield is quoted as a percentage, allowing an easy comparison to going bond rates. Applications The earning yield can be used to compare the earnings of a stock, sector or the whole market against bond yields. Generally, the earnings yields of equities are higher than the yield of risk- free treasury bonds. Some of this may result in dividends, while some may be kept as retained earnings. The market price of stocks may increase or decrease, reflecting the additional risk involved in equity investments. The average P/E ratio for U.S. stocks from 1900 to 2005 is 14, which equates to an earnings yield of over 7%. Adjusted versions Earning yield is one of the factors discussed in Joel Greenblatt's The Little Book That Beats the Market. However, Greenblatt uses an adjusted earning yield formula to account for the fact that different companies have different debt levels and tax rates. Earning Yield = (Earnings Before Interest & Taxes + Depreciation ‚Äì CapEx) / Enterprise Value (Market Value + Debt ‚Äì Cash) This tells you how expensive a company is in relation to the earnings the company generates. When looking at the Earning Yield, we make certain adjustments to a company‚Äôs market capitalization to estimate what it would take to buy the entire company. This involves penalizing companies carrying much debt and rewarding those having much cash.\\"Euclidean Technologies Review of The Little Book That (Still) Beats the Market\\"  See also  * Dividend yield References Category:Financial ratios Category:Factor income distribution ","title":"Earnings yield"},{"id":"4868226","text":"Sambasiva Rao Kosaraju is a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, and division director for Computing & Communication Foundations at the National Science Foundation.Staff Announcement ‚Äì CCF, Farnam Jahanian, NSF, retrieved 2014-01-14.

It states that for every real number x and for every positive integer n the following identity holds:.. : \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\\\left\\\\lfloor x+\\\\frac{k}{n}\\\\right\\\\rfloor=\\\\lfloor nx\\\\rfloor . Proof Split x into its integer part and fractional part, x=\\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor+\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}. There is exactly one k'\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\} with :\\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor=\\\\left\\\\lfloor x+\\\\frac{k'-1}{n}\\\\right\\\\rfloor\\\\le x<\\\\left\\\\lfloor x+\\\\frac{k'}{n}\\\\right\\\\rfloor=\\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor+1. By subtracting the same integer \\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor from inside the floor operations on the left and right sides of this inequality, it may be rewritten as :0=\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}+\\\\frac{k'-1}{n}\\\\right\\\\rfloor\\\\le \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}<\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}+\\\\frac{k'}{n}\\\\right\\\\rfloor=1. Therefore, :1-\\\\frac{k'}{n}\\\\le \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}<1-\\\\frac{k'-1}{n} , and multiplying both sides by n gives :n-k'\\\\le n\\\\, \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} Now if the summation from Hermite's identity is split into two parts at index k', it becomes : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\\\left\\\\lfloor x+\\\\frac{k}{n}\\\\right\\\\rfloor & =\\\\sum_{k=0}^{k'-1} \\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor+\\\\sum_{k=k'}^{n-1} (\\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor+1)=n\\\\, \\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor+n-k' \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & =n\\\\, \\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor+\\\\lfloor n\\\\,\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}\\\\rfloor=\\\\left\\\\lfloor n\\\\, \\\\lfloor x\\\\rfloor+n\\\\, \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} \\\\right\\\\rfloor=\\\\lfloor nx\\\\rfloor. \\\\end{align} Alternate Proof Consider the function :f(x) = \\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor + \\\\left\\\\lfloor x + \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + \\\\ldots + \\\\left\\\\lfloor x + \\\\frac{n - 1}{n} \\\\right\\\\rfloor - \\\\lfloor nx \\\\rfloor Then the identity is clearly equivalent to the statement f(x) = 0 for all real x. But then we find, : f\\\\left(x + \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\right) = \\\\left\\\\lfloor x + \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + \\\\left\\\\lfloor x + \\\\frac{2}{n} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + \\\\ldots + \\\\left\\\\lfloor x + 1 \\\\right\\\\rfloor - \\\\lfloor nx + 1 \\\\rfloor = f(x) Where in the last equality we use the fact that \\\\lfloor x + p \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor + p for all integers p. But then f has period 1/n. It then suffices to prove that f(x) = 0 for all x \\\\in [0, 1/n). But in this case, the integral part of each summand in f is equal to 0.

After private schooling he joined an advertising agency, then joined an estate agency and switched to property development. Career Hyams made much of his fortune developing office space in London at a time in the 1960s and 1970s when rents there were rising significantly. He preferred to find single, blue-chip tenants for his properties, having them fully repair and insure the buildings they occupied, as is now common with commercial property in the UK. This approach enabled Hyams to manage a valuable and sizable property business with a staff of just six. It was also used by him as justification for keeping his 33-storey Centre Point development empty for years after its completion: he claimed he could find no tenant willing to lease all of space.

Pouton was a product of Newcastle United's youth team but was signed as a professional by Oxford United. He signed on pro terms at the beginning of the 1995‚Äì96 season but soon after joined York City where he remained for two years. In 1999, he signed for Grimsby Town where he arguably spent the best years of his career. Pouton notched up 120 league appearances and 12 goals in his four and a half-year stay with the club. In 2004, he was sold to Gillingham but soon after he spent time on loan with Hartlepool United. His time with the Gills was dogged by injury woes and he eventually retired in 2007. A few months after retiring Pouton signed on a semi-professional terms for Dover Athletic and later went on to play for Maidstone United and Sutton United before eventually hanging his boots up permanently in 2010. In 2011, he returned to Maidstone as assistant manager. He left the club in January 2012 as part of budget cuts within the club. Playing career =Oxford United= Pouton came through the youth ranks at Newcastle United, his hometown club, but was not retained, and tried his luck at Oxford United. Again, he was never presented with an opportunity to play during his time there and was released at the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season. =York City= Pouton was snapped up on a free transfer by York City in time for the 1996-97 season. His debut came early on in the season as a substitute in the 2‚Äì1 home defeat against Bournemouth. He produced some good performances in the reserves and was eventually rewarded with his first start in the 3‚Äì0 home win against Hartlepool United. Pouton went on to make 25 appearances that season, three of which were in the FA Cup. His first career goal was an 80th minute consolation goal in the 4‚Äì2 home defeat to Brentford. The following season saw Pouton firmly establish himself as a tough tackling midfielder, although his over-exuberance led to six bookings that season (to add to the six he had received the previous season). The highlight of the 1997/98 season for Pouton undoubtedly came at Roots Hall in a 4‚Äì4 draw with Southend United in which he scored twice. Pouton only scored once the following season, but he managed to pick up nine bookings as he started to pick up a reputation as a tough tackler. =Grimsby Town= At the beginning of the 1999-2000 season, Grimsby Town made an approach to take Pouton on loan. Despite not starting a game during his month-long loan spell, Pouton impressed sufficiently in his six substitute appearances to prompt Grimsby to pay ¬£150,000 to secure him on a permanent basis. Upon signing, Pouton became a first team regular and went on to play in the majority of Grimsby's games that season. Surprisingly, in hindsight, Pouton only picked up two bookings that season in 41 games. His first goal for Grimsby (and only goal of the season) was an equaliser at Blundell Park, Pouton volleyed in at the far post after Nicky Weaver parried Lee Ashcroft's cross in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Manchester City. Over the next three seasons, Pouton was booked 18 times and sent off twice. Despite his occasional lapses in discipline, Pouton was generally a success at Grimsby, and although he was not noted for his goals, he still managed eleven goals including a hat-trick in the 6‚Äì2 home win against Wimbledon (although two of those goals were penalties). He became a cult hero for his Never Say Die attitude, and his repeat step-overs, although he suffered increasing disciplinary problems, missing many games through a combination of injury and suspension. In the 2002-03 season, Grimsby were relegated to Division Two after finishing bottom of Division One. Injury prevented Pouton from playing until December and he only then played five times before leaving the club to free up finances. =Gillingham= Gillingham signed Pouton initially on loan, they eventually paid ¬£30,000 to sign him on a permanent basis. Pouton did reasonably well in a season in which Gillingham narrowly survived relegation, staying up by one goal whilst Walsall were relegated instead. The next season was poor by Pouton's standards. He started the season on loan to Hartlepool United, for whom he played six times and scored in the 3‚Äì3 draw with Hull City in the Football League Trophy (Hartlepool won 4‚Äì1 on penalties). He returned to Gillingham, but only played a handful of games (twelve) as Gillingham were finally relegated. The 2005-06 season was better for Pouton as he re- established himself in midfield. He played in the opening day victory over Colchester United and were it not for a succession of injuries perhaps would have played in more than the 24 games in which he appeared. Injuries continued to bedevil him in the following season, and on 31 January 2007 it was announced that he had opted to retire. =Dover Athletic= Pouton came out of retirement in June 2007 to sign on a semi-professional basis for Dover Athletic, however injuries again restricted him in claiming a regular first team place. During his spell at Dover Athletic, Pouton gained two promotions to the Isthmian League Premier Division and then the Conference South. =Maidstone United= At the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season Pouton decided against signing a new contract with Dover due to work commitments and further travelling. He subsequently signed for fellow Kent side Maidstone United where he was soon appointed vice captain. =Sutton United= In late August 2009 Pouton left Maidstone after just four appearances to join Isthmian League Premier Division rivals Sutton United. Pouton made his debut for Sutton on 5 September 2009 against Boreham Wood and played for the rest of the 2009‚Äì10 campaign at the Gander Green Lane club before retiring from playing at the end of the season. Coaching career On 18 March 2011 Pouton was named caretaker assistant manager at Maidstone United, who at the time were 8 points adrift at the bottom of the Isthmian League Premier Division. Pouton joined up with former Maidstone teammate Jay Saunders who had just been given the role of player-caretaker manager at the club.

H. New, ed. Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002: 1028. is a Canadian-born poet, academic, and former diplomat. A son of the Canadian poet and constitutional lawyer F. R. Scott and painter Marian Dale Scott, he is best known for his critiques of deep politics and American foreign policy since the era of the Vietnam War. Although trained as a political scientist, Scott holds an atypical academic appointment as a poet-scholar in an English department. After receiving undergraduate degrees in philosophy (first-class honours) and political science (second-class honours) from McGill University in 1949, he studied at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques (France, 1949) and University College, Oxford (1950-1952) before receiving a Ph.D. in political science from McGill (with a dissertation on the social and political philosophy of T.S. Eliot) in 1955. He briefly taught in McGill's political science department and spent four years (1957‚Äì1961) with the Canadian diplomatic service before joining the speech department of the University of California, Berkeley as a lecturer in 1961. He was subsequently promoted to assistant professor of speech (1962), associate professor of English (1968), and professor of English (1980); since his nominal retirement in 1994, he has served as professor emeritus of English. Notably, he was a signatory in 1968 of the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, in which participants vowed to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\", New York Post, January 30, 1968 Literary works In terms of poetry, he is best known for his book-length epic poem Coming to Jakarta (subtitled \\"a poem about terror\\"), which describes in measured, prosodically regular verse the 1965 crisis in Indonesia that resulted in the Indonesian Civil War and the deaths of as many as half a million people, in which he believed the CIA to have played a role. Scott is far from a stridently political poet, working always to connect the polemical to the personal. In Coming to Jakarta he writes: :To have learnt from terror to see oneself as part of the enemy :can be a reassurance In the context of this emotional and psychological side of conflict, Scott alternates between descriptions of his own life‚Äî\\"dressed up in polished / gaiters with a buttonhook\\"‚Äîand the massive violence of his principal subject. Somewhere between confessional and scholarly, his poems often contain citations in the margins. Scott has described the book-length Minding the Darkness (2000) as his most important poetic work, though he concedes that \\"Like other long poems by older men. . . it toys dangerously with abstract didactic principles.\\"Introductory matter to excerpts from Minding the Darkness, . The work is intended as the culmination of a trilogy (also including Listening to the Candle [1992]) of which Coming to Jakarta was the inception. Contemporary politics Scott has written about the role of the \\"deep state\\" (as opposed to the \\"public state\\"). Rejecting the label of \\"conspiracy theory\\", he has used the phrase \\"deep politics\\" to describe his political concerns. His interest in contemporary history has spilled over into his works of poetry, some of which must contain marginal notes to explain to readers which documents or real-world news events are being referred to. His book, The Road to 9/11 (2007), deals with geopolitical context of events leading to 9/11, and argues \\"how U.S. foreign policy since the 1960s has led to partial or total cover-ups of past domestic criminal acts, including, perhaps, the catastrophe of 9/11.\\" His books The Road to 9/11 and American War Machine are available in French under the titles La Route vers le Nouveau D√©sordre Mondial and La Machine de Guerre Am√©ricaine. La Route vers le Nouveau D√©sordre Mondial, La Machine de Guerre Am√©ricaine, Editions Demi-Lune official website The latter was reviewed in March 2011 by Bernard Norlain, a retired French five-star General of the Air Force. Review of La Route vers le Nouveau D√©sordre Mondial (The Road to 9/11) by French Air Force general Bernard Norlain In all, his books have been translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and Bahasa Indonesia. His articles have been translated into 16 languages, including Turkish, Arabic, Persian, Chinese, and Japanese. Of Scott's book, American War Machine: Deep Politics, the CIA Global Drug Connection, and the Road to Afghanistan (2010), Daniel Ellsberg commented: \\"I said of Scott's last brilliant take on this subject, Drugs, Oil and War, that 'It makes most academic and journalistic explanations of our past and current interventions read like government propaganda written for children.' Now Scott has written an even better book. Read it!\\" An aspect of Scott's work that combines both his investigating interests and his poetry is illustrated by The Global Drug Meta-Group: Drugs, Managed Violence, and the Russian 9/11.The Global Drug Meta-Group: Drugs, Managed Violence, and the Russian 9/11, Books =War Conspiracy= In 1972, Bobbs-Merrill Company published Scott's The War Conspiracy. The book describes Scott's theories of why the United States went to war in Vietnam. Kirkus Reviews said War Conspiracy is \\"undoubtedly one of the most important overviews to date of the subterranean reaches of the U.S. intelligence machine in Southeast Asia.\\" =Deep Politics and the Death of JFK= Scott's Deep Politics and the Death of JFK was published in 1993 University of California Press. Promotional reviews of the book were provided by Bruce Cumings, Gaeton Fonzi, and Oliver Stone. Kirkus Reviews called the book a \\"[s]taggeringly well-researched and intelligent overview not only of the JFK assassination but also of the rise of forces undermining American democracy\\". The Kirkus review also described the book as a \\"kind of Rosetta stone for cracking open the deepest darkness in American politics.\\" Publishers Weekly said that Scott's \\"thoughtful, extremely (and sometimes excessively) detailed book promises more than it actually delivers\\" and that \\"the 'facts' on which he relies are often the result of other people's not necessarily accurate reporting\\". According to PW, \\"[t]he book's most useful feature is a careful discussion of how U.S. Vietnam policy changed abruptly after Kennedy's death.\\" In a 2004 review for The Wilson Quarterly, Max Holland wrote that \\"Deep Politics is an unreadable compendium of 'may haves' and 'might haves,' non-sequiturs, and McCarthy-style innuendo, with enough documentation to satisfy any paranoid.\\" Shortly thereafter, Holland reiterated similar comments in a second piece written for Reviews in American History and criticized the University of California Press' editorial committee for approving the publication of the book: \\"This peer approval by a major university press illustrates the boundless and utter disbelief in the Warren Report that exists even in the highest reaches of the academy, and it also reveals the gross inattention given to the subject by serious historians.\\" Scott responded with a letter to the editor stating: \\"I was disappointed to see those who have published me attacked vigorously for doing so by a major historical journal. I continue to believe that it is the job of the academy to open minds, not to close them.\\" In 2013, former Salon editor-in-chief David Talbot included Deep Politics in his list of top seven \\"best books on the subject\\", describing the work as a \\"masterpiece, a meticulously detailed examination of the deep network of power that underlies the events in Dallas.... filled with provocative insights about how the upper circles of U.S. power actually operate.\\" Bibliography =Political Books= *The War Conspiracy: JFK, 911, and the Deep Politics of War.

Life Klein was born on 15 August 1685 in K√∂nigsberg, Duchy of Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). He studied natural history and history at the University of K√∂nigsberg. Between 1706 and 1712, Klein travelled through England, Germany, Holland and Austria in an educational journey, before returning to K√∂nigsberg. He moved to Danzig after the death of his father, where he was elected city secretary in 1713. Between 1714 and 1716 he served as the city's representative, or ‚Äúresident secretary at court,‚Äù (residierender Sekret√§r) in Dresden and then Warsaw. Klein began his scientific works in 1713 and began publishing his findings by 1722, as a member of the Institute of Sciences in Bologna. Influenced by Johann Philipp Breyne, his works dealt with matters of zoological nomenclature, and he set up his own system of classification of animals, which was based on the number, shape, and position of the limbs. He used his position as secretary to found a botanical garden there (now called Ogr√≥d Botaniczny w Oliwie). For his work in the natural sciences, Klein had been rewarded with membership of several scientific societies, including the Royal Society in London, the Academy of in St. Petersburg, the Deutsche Gesellschaft in Jena, and the Danzig Research Society. One of Klein's daughters, Dorothea Juliane Klein, married physicist Darniel Gralath, who would become mayor of Danzig. Gralath inherited Klein's library, which was praised by Swiss mathematician Jogann Bernoulli. Klein died on 27 February 1759 in Danzig.Armin Geus: \\"Klein, Jacob Theodor\\". In: Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB). Band 11, Duncker & Humblot, Berlin 1977, pp. 740ff.  Botanical garden and \\"Museum Kleinianum\\"  An illustration of Klein's botanical garden by Johann Mentzel (1750), featured on the title page of Klein's Historiae Avium Prodromus Using his position as secretary of Danzig and with the help of other scholars, Klein set up a botanical garden in 1718, which was one of, if not the largest of its time. The garden was expanded to include live animals, zoological, fossil and amber collections, the shell collection of the mayor of Amsterdam Nicolaus Witsen, as well as a greenhouse which he used for experimentation with exotic plants. The collection became known as the Museum Kleinianum. It was sold to Margrave Friedrich of Brandenburg-Kulmbach in 1740. After the Margrave's death in 1763, the collection was donated to the Friedrich-Alexander Universit√§t Erlangen- N√ºrnberg (FAU). It was praised by prominent Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli, who visited the museum in 1777 or 1778.  Scientific works  = System of classification = Inspired by Johann Phillipp Breyne, Klein developed an interest in science as early as 1713 and began publishing in 1722. He was especially interested in the systematic classification of living organisms, but excluded insects from his classifications. His system was based on external, easily identifiable traits, such as the number, shape and position of limbs. This put his work in opposition with that of Carl von Linn√©, of whom he was critical, and whose work has since garnered more widespread recognition, though some of Klein's classifications are still in use, for example, in the naming of echidnoderms. His work on sea urchins was the most prominent source of information on the species at the time. His essay Tentamen Herpetologiae (1755) featured the first mention of the term herpetology - the study of amphibians. However, his system of classification meant that species such as frogs and lizards, which belong to amphibians and reptiles respectively, were not distinguished as belonging to separate classes. Klein was critical of Linnaeus' system of classification, believing only easily recognisable features could be used to classify animals, as Adam had done when naming animals according to the Biblical story of creation. Illustrations from Historiae Piscium Naturalis = Historiae Piscium Naturalis = A portrait of Klein, from his time as Secretary of Danzig, featured in Historiae Piscium Naturalis Klein published Historiae Piscium Naturalis promovendae Missus primus Gedani in 1744. The publication, dedicated to the Royal Society, focused on understanding the auditory capacity of cartilaginous and spinose fishes. According to John Eames, until the publication of the work, it was believed to have been understood that only cetaceous fish were known to have auditory passages, or ear holes, and that the question of whether fish could hear was still not understood. Aristotle claimed, in his \\"History of Animals,\\" that fishes possessed no evident auditory organs, but believed that nonetheless they must hear. In the Preface, Klein cites the work of Giulio Casare Casseri, who discovered bones in the heads of Pike or Jack fish, which he understood to be their organs of hearing, though he did not discover any manifest external auditory passages. In section of the essay titled De Lapillis, eorumque Numero in Craniis Piscium (roughly translated as ‚ÄúThe bones, their number in the skull of Fish‚Äù) Klein considers what parts of the head of fish serve as the organ of hearing, and by what passages the sensation of sound is communicated to them. He refers to these bones as Ossicula ‚Äì little bones ‚Äì and considers them essential parts of the head, generated with the brain itself. He notes that the bones scale proportional to the size of the fish, and are most easily discovered in the heads of Spinose fish. Klein identifies three pairs of bones to which he attributes the sense of hearing, and he takes to correspond to the Incus, Malleus and Stapes of other animals. The first are the two largest, which he explains are easily found; the other two pairs, he explains, are small, difficult to find, enveloped in distinct fine membranes. Klein believed one could determine the age of fish by analysing the number and thickness of the Laminae and fibres of these bones. The bone to which Klein was referring, now called the otolith, acquires a growth ring every day for at least the first six months of its life. Klein inquiries into the nature of the passages by which vibrations produce a sense of hearing. He inspects the head of a Pike fish and observes several holes with bristles which lead to the auditory bones. He later dissected a Sturgeon fish and traced the auditory duct to the membrane in which the three bones are placed. Klein concludes that fishes do indeed have hearing organs and passages, communicated to through slight vibrations, though these passages are not easily demonstrable in many species. He observes that the auditory organs of cetaceous, cartilaginous and spinose fish differ from one another in structure and substance. The auditory organs of cetaceous fish are bony, while they are more fragile for cartilaginous fishes, he explains. He adds that water does not act as an impediment to hearing, but rather is the ‚Äúintermedium‚Äù by which sound is communicated.  Honours  Klein had been awarded the membership of several scientific societies, including the Royal Society in London, the St. Petersburg Academy, and the Danzig Research Society. The name of the genus Kleinia was given to the plant family of Compositae (Asteraceae) by Linnaeus in honour of Klein's works. He was described as the most important natural philosopher of his century by Professor Johann Daniel Titius.  Criticism  Although well respected by his colleagues, Klein was nonetheless accused by some contemporaries of being unscientific, alleging that he based his beliefs on the hearsay and the claims of ‚Äòcredulous‚Äô people. The 1760 edition of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London published a letter by 18th Century botanist and Fellow of the Royal Society, Peter Collinson, criticizing Klein for his belief that swallows (sand martins) are not migratory birds, and instead ‚Äòretire under water‚Äô during winters. Collinson accused Klein's assertion as being ‚Äúcontrary to nature and reason,‚Äù and provided observations of Marine officers, such as Sir Charles Wager, to further his claim.

Life Her father was King Kamehameha I and her mother was KalƒÅkua KaheiheimƒÅlie. She was born probably in 1805 on the island of Oahu at Waikiki. She was given in hƒÅnai to her stepmother Peleuli and her second husband Kawelookalani, her father's half- brother. Peleuli named her Kƒ´nau after her son Kah≈çanok≈´ Kƒ´nau (her half- brother) and took her back to the island of Hawaii after Kamehameha moved his capital back to Kailua-Kona. Kƒ´nau was first married to her half-brother Liholiho (1797‚Äì1824) who ascended in 1819 as King Kamehameha II. In 1824, at around 19 years of age, she became Dowager Queen when Kamehameha II died in London with his favorite wife (her sister) Queen KamƒÅmalu. Her second husband was Kahalaia Luanuu, a grandson of Kamehameha I. She had two children, one who was adopted by another high-ranking chiefly familyKe Kumu Hawaii newspaper. Buke 3, Pepa 6, Aoao 21. Augate 16, 1837. (August 16, 1837): p. 21 and the other a son who perished along with his father in the whooping cough epidemic of 1826. Her third husband was Mataio Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa (1791‚Äì1868), from 1827. Queen Kaahumanu was furious over their union because of his inferior rank and her wish that she married Kamehameha III in accordance with their father's wish that his children by Ke≈çp≈´olani would continue his line with his children by KaheiheimƒÅlie. Kek≈´anƒÅoa was governor of Oahu (1834‚Äì1868). To him she bore four sons: David Kamehameha (1828‚Äì1835), Moses Kek≈´ƒÅiwa (1829‚Äì1848), Lot KapuƒÅiwa (1830‚Äì1873), and Alexander Liholiho (1830‚Äì1873), and one daughter Victoria KamƒÅmalu (1838‚Äì1866). She became the Kuhina Nui (an office somewhat like prime minister or co-regent) styled as Kaahumanu II June 5, 1832, when Queen Kaahumanu died. She acted as the regent for her brother Kauikeaouli when he became King Kamehameha III, from June 5, 1832, to March 15, 1833. She ruled with him until her death. She was responsible for enforcing Hawaii's first penal code, proclaimed by the king in 1835. She adopted Protestant Christianity like many of the chiefs and chiefesses. She persecuted many of the Catholic missionaries and tried to expel the French Jesuit priests, which would later lead into diplomatic troubles with France. During the early years of Kamehameha III, he was seen to be indifferent to his duties as king and spend his time pursuing leisure instead of ruling, according to the missionaries. She felt she had to take full duty of a monarch, but soon became disheartened and at length came to Laura Fish Judd, the wife of Gerrit P. Judd, and said: \\"I am in sore straits and heavy hearted, and I have come to tell you my thought. I am quite discouraged and cannot bear this burden any longer. I wish to throw away my rank and title and responsibility together, bring my family here, and live with you; or, we will take our families and go away together.\\" Mrs. Judd referred her to the story of Esther, and pointed out to her that she must be strong and accept the responsibility of Regent of the nation for the sake of her people. Kƒ´nau and Kamehameha III argued over government policies. Kƒ´nau favored the policies recommended by the missionaries and was not as tolerant of other religions as her predecessor, Kaahumanu. She strengthened the land tenure of the Crown Lands by written and official proclamation. Kamehameha III resented the lessened power of the king who no longer had sole power to give and take land at will. He wanted the old ways for his people. Eventually they resolved their differences and formed a new government. Now there was a King, a Kuhina Nui, and a Counsel of Chiefs. Her two sons from her third husband who had survived to adulthood ascended as kings of Hawaii: the younger Alexander Liholiho as Kamehameha IV and then Lot KapuƒÅiwa as Kamehameha V. Her only daughter Victoria KamƒÅmalu became Kuhina Nui as Kaahumanu IV. Her widower Mataio Kek≈´anƒÅoa became Kuhina Nui from 1863 until August 24, 1864, the last holder of that position when it was dissolved by the 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Kaahumanu II died of the mumps at Honolulu, Oahu on April 4, 1839. Her funeral was held on July 7 at Kawaiaha ªo Church and she was buried in the Pohukaina Mausoleum on the grounds of  ªIolani Palace. British Admiral Edward Belcher attended and described her funeral in detail. Her remains were later transported along with those of other royals in a midnight torchlight procession on October 30, 1865, to the newly constructed Mauna  ªAla Royal Mausoleum up in the Nu ªuanu Valley.

URL accessed 1 July 2008. It was granted city status in 1926. History =Free Borough and Police Commissioners= In about 1230, the vill of Salford, Lancashire, was created a free borough by charter granted by Ranulph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester. The borough's government was in the hands of a borough-reeve and portmote court. The reeve was elected by the burgesses at large, while the head of the Molyneux family of Sefton presided over the court as hereditary steward of the Hundred of Salford. In 1791 the first modern local government was established in the area, when the Manchester and Salford Police Act created commissioners to administer the two towns. In 1843 the inhabitant householders petitioned the Privy Council for a charter of incorporation under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 The charter was granted on 16 April 1844, and the Municipal Borough of Salford came into existence on 1 November. =Municipal borough= The borough originally consisted of the township of Salford and the part of Broughton township south of the River Irwell. It was divided into four wards (Blackfriars, Crescent, St Stephen's and Trinity), with a town council consisting of a mayor, eight aldermen and twenty-four councillors. In 1853 the borough was extended to include the rest of Broughton and Pendleton township. The wards of the borough were redrawn and increased in number to sixteen. Salford township was divided into seven wards, Broughton into three and Pendleton into six. Each ward was represented by three councillors and one alderman, and the size of the council consequently increased to forty-eight councillors and sixteen aldermen. The names of the wards were as follows: Albert Park, Charlestown, Crescent, Grosvenor, Hope, Islington, Kersal, Ordsall, Regent, St Matthias's, St Paul's, St Thomas's, Seedley, Trafford, Trinity and Weaste. =County borough and city= Under the Local Government Act 1888 all municipal boroughs with a population of 50,000 or more were designated as \\"county boroughs\\" with the powers of both a municipal borough and a county council. In 1889, therefore, the town became the County Borough of Salford.Local Government Act 1888 C.41, S.31 Although independent of Lancashire County Council, Salford remained part of the county for certain purposes such as lieutenancy, shrievalty, custos rotulorum and administration of justice. The size of the borough council did not change, although the wards were reorganised in 1921. The wards, which remained until the borough's abolition were as follows: No.1 or Charlestown, No.2 or Kersal, No.3 or Mandley Park, No.4 or Albert Park, No.5 or St Matthias's, No.6 or Trinity, No.7 or Crescent, No.8 or Regent, No.9 or Ordsall Park, No.10 or Docks, No.11 or St. Thomas's, No.12 or St Paul's, No.13 or Langworthy, No.14 or Seedley, No.15 or Weaste and No.16 or Claremont. Following a campaign supported by William Joynson-Hicks, Home Secretary and MP for a neighbouring constituency of Manchester, city status was granted to the county borough by letters patent dated 21 April 1926. This was in spite of the opposition of civil servants in the Home Office who dismissed the borough as \\"merely a scratch collection of 240,000 people cut off from Manchester by the river\\".Beckett, J V, City status in the British Isles, 1830‚Äì2002 Aldershot, 2005 The City and County Borough of Salford was abolished in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 and its territory transferred to Greater Manchester to form part of the metropolitan borough and City of Salford. At abolition the county borough was surrounded by the City and county Borough of Manchester to the east, the Municipal Borough of Swinton and Pendlebury to the northwest, the Municipal Borough of Eccles to the southwest, and the Municipal Borough of Stretford to the south. The corporation progressively accumulated increased powers and responsibilities through government legislation and by the promotion of private parliamentary bills. The range of activities in which it was involved can be ascertained by the large number of committees of the borough council in 1909: Buildings and Bridges; Cemeteries; Education; Electricity; Health; Highways and Paving; Improvement; Lighting and cleaning; Museums, Libraries and Parks; Parliamentary and Public Trusts; River Irwell Consevancy; Town Halls and Markets; Tramways; Watch (police) and Water. =Political control= Elections to the borough council were held annually, with one third of councillors being elected each year. Aldermen had a six-year term of office, with one half of their number being elected by the council every three years. As was common in borough elections throughout England, early elections were often uncontested, with agreed candidates being elected unopposed.Albert shaw, Municipal Government in Great Britain in Political Science Quarterly, Vol.4, No.2, June 1889, pp. 197‚Äì229 As late as 1883 only two wards were contested.The Municipal Elections, The Times, 2 November 1883, p.6 Although party labels were not used, there were in fact two groupings on the council, aligned to the parliamentary Conservative and Liberal parties. Conservatives were in a majority until 1892 when the two groups reached parity, with an independent councillor holding the balance of power.The Municipal Elections, The Times, 2 November 1892, p.6 The Conservatives regained power in 1893, and by 1894 the Liberal grouping had divided into \\"Gladstonians\\" and \\"Radicals\\", with the Independent Labour Party contesting seats in their own right.The Municipal Elections, The Times, 2 November 1894, p.6 Conservatives and other Unionist members maintained a large majority until 1919. In that year the Labour Party gained five seats, leaving the council evenly divided between Conservatives and Liberal-Labour.Borough Council Elections, The Times, 3 November 1892, p.7 There was thereafter no single party in power for a number of years, with Conservative, Labour, Liberal and Independent groups represented. In 1931 the Conservatives gained control for three years, before the council returned to no overall control.The Municipal Elections, The Times, 4 November 1931, p.6The Municipal Elections, The Times, 3 November 1934, p.7 Following the cancellation of elections for the duration of World War II, a Labour landslide saw the party gain a majority for the first time.The Municipal Elections, The Times, 2 November 1945, p.8 Labour held the council with a large majority for more than twenty years until the Conservatives returned to power in 1968.Tories reap reach harvest from Labour, The Times, 10 May 1968, p.8 Three years later the Conservatives lost power.Tories lose ground in face of Labour upsurge in local polls, The Times, 14 May 1971 p.5 The final election prior to abolition was held in 1972, and saw Labour regain a majority.Widespread Labour gains in borough elections, The Times, 5 May 1972 Coat of arms The Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Salford was granted arms and crest on 5 November 1844, and on the following day received a further grant of heraldic supporters. The blazon was as follows:A C Fox-Davies, The Book of Public Arms, 2nd edition, London 1915 Azure semee of bees volant a shuttle between three garbs Or on a chief of the last a bale corded proper between two millrinds sable; and for a Crest: On a wreath of the colours a demi lion argent supporting a lance proper therefrom flowing to the sinister a flag azure charged with a shuttle Or. Supporters: On the dexter side a wolf Or around the neck a chain and pendent therefrom an escocheon gules charged with a millrind also Or on the sinister side an heraldic antelope argent armed crined and unguled Or around the neck a chain and pendent therefrom an escocheon gules charged with a rose also argent. The basis of the shield are the three gold wheatsheaves on a blue field of the Earldom of Chester. To this were added a bale for the cotton industry, millrinds for the production of iron, a shuttle for weaving and bees for industry in general. The crest was a half-lion supporting a banner bearing a shuttle. The supporters were a wolf, an emblem of the early Earls of Chester; and an heraldic antelope from the arms of the Beaufort family, representing the Duchy of Lancaster. The arms granted to Manchester two years earlier had a similar supporter for the same reason. The motto was Integrity and Industry.C Wilfrid Scott-Giles, Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition, London, 1953 On 15 September 1959 the corporation received the grant of an heraldic badge: Within a collar argent fimbriated Or set thereon four roses gules barbed and seeded proper and as many letters S also gules alternately a hurt thereon issuant from a wreath of sallow a demi lion also argent. The \\"collar of SS\\" was derived from the insignia of the Duchy of Lancaster, while the red rose of Lancaster was from Lancashire. The sallow leaves referred to the derivation of the name \\"Salford\\" from \\"Sallow Ford\\". The lion was taken from the crest.Geoffrey Briggs, Civic and Corporate Heraldry, London, 1972 Police force As required by the Municipal Corporations Act, one of the first actions of the newly created town council was to appoint a Watch Committee to establish a police force, Salford Borough Police, and appoint a chief constable.Jenifer Hart, Reform of the Borough Police, 1835‚Äì1856 in The English Historical Review, Vol. 70, No. 276, (July 1955), pp. 411‚Äì427 In 1928 the force introduced police boxes to the streets of Salford.Police Telephone Boxes, The Times, 24 April 1928, p.13 Following inspection by the Metropolitan Police, similar boxes were erected in London. The Police Act 1964 allowed for the compulsory amalgamation of police forces, and on 1 June 1968 the Manchester and Salford city constabularies formed the Manchester and Salford Police. Salford Corporation Transport In 1875, the corporations of Manchester and Salford gained powers under the Tramways Act 1870 to construct a horse tramway network. Services started on 17 May 1877, with a private company, the Manchester Carriage Company (later Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company) operating services on a 21-year lease. The lease was eventually extended until 1901, with Manchester taking over their portion of the network on 27 April and Salford on 2 May. The lines were quickly electrified, with work completed by 1903, and the system was extended to Worsley in 1906. Through services were operated over the lines of neighbouring municipalities, reaching Middleton and Swinton and Pendlebury In 1920 Salford commenced motorbus operation, and the first tram routes were withdrawn in 1932. The last tram went out of service on 31 March 1947. By this time the undertaking had been renamed Salford City Transport. On 1 November 1969 SCT was merged into the SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive.

This commonly refers to a personal finance process of individuals addressing high consumer debt. Debt management plans help reduce outstanding, unsecured debts over time to help the debtor regain control of finances. The process can secure a lower overall interest rate, longer repayment terms, or an overall reduction in the debt itself. Overview DMPs for consumers are often negotiated by a credit counseling agency on behalf of the debtor. Credit counseling agencies often address the debt by working with the debtor to set a budget based on their regular income and expenditures that will then include one regular bill payment that is allocated across the creditor(s). Agencies will negotiate on behalf of the debtor to lower payments and interest rates with creditors. Some of the agencies are non-profits that charge no or non-fee rates, while others can be for-profit and include high fees. The effect on the debtor's overall credit score will vary. In the United Kingdom, as well as DMPs, residents can also apply for an Individual voluntary arrangement (IVAs), which can give the debtor a discount on their debt. Regulations =United States= In the United States, credit counseling agencies are loosely regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's consumer protection agency, which can sue companies that have deceived consumers about the cost, nature, or benefits of their services. Different states may regulate DMPs individually and attorneys general are empowered to protect state citizens from fraud. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority is responsible for the regulation of consumer credit and has established a Debt Management Plan Protocol. It can impose fines for improper conduct. =European Union= Elsewhere in the European Union, regulation and non- regulation of credit counseling agencies and their approaches, including DMPs, are widely varied. In Sweden, guidelines for credit counseling are loosely provided by the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (TCO) and creditors are encouraged to use them in lieu of the court system. In Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) provides debt resolution information directly to debtors. In Latvia, a debt advisory company called LAKRA works with employers to assist indebted employees.

Carson and her family remained in this home until she completed her studies at the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) in 1929. She continued her studies in Baltimore at Johns Hopkins University. Her family soon followed her to Baltimore. The house was sold to a local high school English teacher who updated utilities and added rooms, extending the footprint of the original home. The original four rooms used by the Carsons remain substantially unchanged. The grounds are reduced to a little more than a half-acre, but a small hiking trail accesses adjoining municipal property. A springhouse, still standing, was the source of water for the Carsons. The homestead is managed by the Rachel Carson Homestead Association, Inc. (RCHA), a nonprofit organization. Established in 1975, the RCHA maintains the home, and welcomes visitors to tours and events. The mission of the Rachel Carson Homestead Association is to preserve, restore, and interpret Rachel Carson's birthplace; to design and implement environmental education programs; and to educate the community, guided by her environmental ethics and sense of wonder. The organization established the Rachel Carson Legacy Challenge, which challenges individuals, government, industry and institutions to lessen their ecological footprint. The challenge uses Carson's environmental ethic as the benchmark for permanent and measurable change. The Rachel Carson Challenge, a 35-mile wilderness hike on the Saturday closest to the summer solstice, was established in honor of Rachel Carson's contribution to the environment and passes by the Homestead. The Rachel Carson Trail is managed by the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy. Rachel Carson wrote her influential book Silent Spring at Rachel Carson House (Colesville, Maryland).

Like many stations that were owned by Equity Broadcasting, the stations were operated remotely by satellite; their programming could be seen free-to-air on Galaxy 18.Lyngsat FTA channel listings for Equity on Galaxy 3C (C-band, 95¬∞W) and Galaxy 18 (Ku, 123¬∞W) History The Las Vegas station was founded on January 12, 1993 as K63FD, and later gained the call sign KTVY-LP in 1997. In April 2002, the Goldfield station signed on as KTVY- TV, matching the station in Las Vegas. Finally, in late May 2005, both stations changed their call sign to the current KEGS. Until May 30, 2007, KEGS was affiliated with ImaginAsian. On that day, the station switched to the Retro Television Network (RTN).RTN/Equity Broadcasting website, accessed 4/20/08 On January 4, 2009, a contract conflict between Equity Media Holdings Corporation and RTN interrupted the programming on many RTN affiliates.What‚Äôs Wrong with MyTV? As a result, Luken Communications, LLC (who had purchased RTN in June 2008), restored a national RTN feed from its headquarters in Chattanooga, Tennessee, with individual customized feeds to non-Equity-owned affiliates to follow on a piecemeal basis. As a result, KEGS lost its RTN affiliation immediately, though Luken vowed to find a new affiliate for RTN in the Las Vegas market.TV Newsday: \\"Financial Dispute Disrupts RTN Diginet\\", 1/5/2009. Viewers in the Reno area could still watch RTN on the digital subchannel of local Fox affiliate KRXI-TV, while KGNG-LP's DT4 subchannel took the affiliation in Las Vegas in June 2009. At auction on April 16, 2009, KEGS- LP was sold to Mako Communications, while KRRI-LP and KELM-LP were sold to Ngensolutions LLC. In June 2013, Mako planned to sell what had become KEGS-LD to Landover 5 LLC as part of a larger deal involving 51 other low-power television stations; the deal fell through in June 2016, and in 2017 Mako's stations, including KEGS-LD, were acquired by HC2 Holdings. The full-service KEGS signal never found a buyer, and signed off permanently on June 12, 2009; its license was finally canceled on July 6, 2010. Digital television Because it was granted an original construction permit after the FCC finalized the DTV allotment plan on April 21, 1997,http://www.transmitter.com/FCC97115/chanplan.html the station did not receive a companion channel for a digital television station. Instead, at the end of the digital TV conversion period for full-service stations, KEGS would have been required to turn off its analog signal and turn on its digital signal (called a \\"flash-cut\\"). The station's owner, Equity Media Holdings, declared bankruptcy in 2008 and was unable to construct digital facilities, leaving the station to go dark in 2009. According to the station's DTV status report, \\"On December 8, 2008, the licensee's parent corporation filed a petition for bankruptcy relief under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code... This station must obtain post-petition financing and court approval before digital facilities may be constructed. The station must cease analogue broadcasting on February 17, 2009, regardless of whether digital facilities are operational by that date. The station will file authority to remain silent if so required by the FCC.\\"FCC DTV status report While the DTV Delay Act extended this deadline to June 12, 2009, Equity had applied for an extension of the digital construction permit in order to retain the broadcast license after the station became silent. Equity Broadcasting also held a construction permit to construct a digital companion station to KEGS-LP on channel 24 in Las Vegas; that station, as a low-power broadcasting operation, was not required to cease analog transmission due to DTV transition in 2009. While the majority of Equity's assets were sold in a 2009 liquidation, neither the digital KEGS transmitter nor the new Las Vegas station were ever constructed.

Prewar routes Railway Air Services DH.89 Dragon Rapide G-ACPR at Manchester (Ringway) Airport in 1938 The airline's main operating and maintenance base was at London's Croydon Airport pre- and post-war, and at Liverpool Airport during World War Two. The most important RAS route flown was between London and Scotland (London-Birmingham-Manchester/Liverpool-Belfast-Glasgow).Stroud (1987) pp.37-40 The trunk service commenced on 20 August 1934, using the airline's newly delivered DH.86 Express biplane airliners, which operated once daily in each direction. The service was mainly aimed at passengers wishing to connect at Croydon Airport with IALs flights to the Continent. RAS were unhappy with winter operations at Manchester's small airfield at Barton Aerodrome and the flights switched to the larger Liverpool (Speke) from the late October, resuming through Barton on 15 April 1935. Routes operated from Cardiff Municipal Airport included Cardiff to Plymouth and Cardiff to Liverpool and commenced in 1934. Second World War In 1939 the operation of civil aircraft was restricted and part of the RAS fleet was placed under government control. The aircraft were involved in communications flights for the military within the British Isles. By 1940 the Royal Air Force had taken over all the military communications tasks and the airline returned to flying routes 'of national importance'. In practice, wartime operations were restricted to the Liverpool-Belfast-Glasgow route carrying government and other 'priority' passengers and mail.Stroud (1987) pp.70-75. Postwar operations RAS Avro Anson at Manchester (Ringway) in 1946 operating the schedule to Belfast Railway Air Services resumed peacetime flights in early 1946, now also using their newly acquired Avro Ansons and ex-RAF Douglas DC-3 Dakotas. A number of ex Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 52 trimotor aircraft were used during 1946/47 before retirement and scrapping. The airline operated its Dakotas, with their higher passenger carrying capacity, on their non-stop flights from Croydon to Glasgow (Renfrew) Airport. A new twice-daily RAS scheduled service commenced on 29 July 1946, using the Avro Ansons, which linked linking Croydon with Manchester Ringway and Belfast (Nutts Corner) Airport. Nationalisation In August 1946, the UK government formed the British European Airways Corporation (BEA) a state-owned airline. The airline was given a monopoly of scheduled air services within the United Kingdom and to continental Europe. From 1 August 1946 RAS operated all its services on behalf of BEA until it ceased operations on 31 January 1947 with BEA acquiring the RAS aircraft, staff and routes.Stroud (1987) pp.91-92 A memory does live on however.

It was discovered on 30 August 1981, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Anderson Mesa Station, Arizona, United States. The asteroid was named after comic-book illustrator Carl Barks.  Orbit and classification  Barks orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.4‚Äì3.1 AU once every 4 years and 6 months (1,640 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Johannesburg Observatory in 1935. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in 1954, or 27 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS taxonomy, Barks is characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In August 2012, a rotational lightcurve of Barks was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at the Oakley Southern Sky Observatory () in Australia. Lightcurve analysis gave a well- defined rotation period of 6.084 hours with a brightness variation of 0.26 magnitude (). This concurs with observations taken at the Palomar Transient Factory in January 2011, which gave a period of 6.087 hours and an amplitude of 0.28 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Barks measures between 9.87 and 15.830 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.162 and 0.415. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 24.30 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.8.  Naming  This minor planet was named for American cartoonist Carl Barks (1901‚Äì2000), best known for the fictional character Scrooge McDuck he created while working at Walt Disney in the late 1940s. In many of his stories, he described space exploration and adventure. Barks was one of the first to use the term \\"rubble pile asteroid\\". Peter Thomas, an assistant of Cornell University, proposed the idea of naming an asteroid after Barks. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 28 January 1983 (). A week later, Thomas informed Barks by mail about his initiative.

In the first novel, the character Garric or-Reise discovers that he is, in fact, the direct descendant of the last king to rule the Isles, exactly a millennium ago. Then, as now, the power that fueled all magic in the world rose precipitously, allowing the use of spells so powerful that they shattered the cohesion of nations, driving them apart and in the process killing Garric's ancestor, Carrus, and sinking the island of Yole. The novels deal with Garric's claim to the throne of the Isles, and his attempts to unite them once again. In the process, he and his companions are challenged by foes both physical and supernatural, which they must overcome. The basic outline of many of the novels deals with the characters being split apart, often taken to parallel universes or distant periods in time, by some hostile entity or group, which they must then defeat before, or in the process of, re-uniting. Magic in the series is based on a now-dead language, the Old Script. Its characters are usually drawn using an athame (made of a variety of substances including iron, twigs and ivory) and the words spoken aloud. The introduction states that these are actual incantations from the Classical world.

Born in Cambridge in 1911, he was largely self-educated, and developed an early interest in books and natural history. His initial work experience was at a Cambridge bookshop, but he also had a position as an assistant in the university botany department. At the age of 29 he married Eldwyth Ruth Alford, who later became his collaborator. He died in London in 2001. While at the bookshop, he was offered a position as a librarian at the Royal Horticultural Society in London (1933‚Äì1952). From there he moved to the Natural History Museum as a scientific officer in the botany department (1952‚Äì1976). After his retirement, he continued working there, writing, and serving on a number of professional bodies related to his work, including the Linnean Society, of which he became president. He also taught botany at Cambridge University as a visiting professor (1977‚Äì1983). Stearn is known for his work in botanical taxonomy and botanical history, particularly classical botanical literature, botanical illustration and for his studies of the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus. His best known books are his Dictionary of Plant Names for Gardeners, a popular guide to the scientific names of plants, and his Botanical Latin for scientists. Stearn received many honours for his work, at home and abroad, and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1997. Considered one of the most eminent British botanists of his time, he is remembered by an essay prize in his name from the Society for the History of Natural History, and a named cultivar of Epimedium, one of many genera he produced monographs on. He is the botanical authority for over 400 plants that he named and described. Life = Childhood = William Thomas Stearn was born at 37 Springfield Road, Chesterton, Cambridge, England, on 16 April 1911, the eldest of four sons, to Thomas Stearn (1871 or 1872‚Äì1922) and Ellen (\\"Nellie\\") Kiddy (1886‚Äì1986) of West Suffolk. His father worked as a coachman to a Cambridge doctor. Chesterton was then a village on the north bank of the River Cam, about two miles north of Cambridge's city centre, where Springfield Road ran parallel to Milton Road to the west. William Stearn's early education was at the nearby Milton Road Junior Council School (see image). Despite not having any family background in science (though he recalled that his grandfather was the university rat-catcher) he developed a keen interest in natural history and books at an early age. He spent his school holidays on his uncle's Suffolk farm, tending cows grazing by the roadside where he would observe the wild flowers of the hedgerows and fields. Stearn's father died suddenly in 1922 when Stearn was only eleven, leaving his working-class family in financial difficulties as his widow (Stearn's mother) had no pension. That year, William Stearn succeeded in obtaining a scholarship to the local Cambridge High School for Boys on Hills Road, close to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, which he attended for eight years till he was 18. The school had an excellent reputation for biology education, and while he was there, he was encouraged by Mr Eastwood, a biology teacher who recognised his talents. The school also provided him with a thorough education in both Latin and Greek. He became secretary of the school's Natural History Society, won an essay prize from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and spent much of his time at the Botanic Garden. Stearn also gained horticultural experience by working as a gardener's boy during his school holidays, to supplement the family income. Stearn attended evening lectures on paleobotany given by Albert Seward (chair of botany at Cambridge University 1906‚Äì1936), and Harry Godwin. Seward was impressed by the young Stearn, giving him access to the herbarium of the Botany School (now Department of Plant Sciences‚Äîsee 1904 photograph) and allowing him to work there as a part-time research assistant. Later, Seward also gave Stearn access to the Cambridge University Library to pursue his research. =Later life= Stearn was largely self-educated and his widowed mother worked hard to support him while at school but could not afford a university education for him, there being no grants available then. When not at the Botany School, he attended evening classes to develop linguistic and bibliographic skills. His classes there included German and the classics. He obtained his first employment at the age of 18 in 1929, a time of high unemployment, to support himself and his family. He worked as an apprentice antiquarian bookseller and cataloguer in the second-hand section at Bowes & Bowes bookshop, 1 Trinity Street (now Cambridge University Press), between 1929 and 1933 where he was able to pursue his passion for bibliography. During his employment there, he spent much of his lunchtimes, evenings and weekends, at the Botany School and Botanic Garden. This was at a time when botany was thriving at Cambridge under the leadership of Seward and Humphrey Gilbert- Carter. On 3 August 1940, he married Eldwyth Ruth Alford (1910‚Äì2013), by whom he had a son and two daughters, and who collaborated with him in much of his work. Ruth Alford was a secondary school teacher from Tavistock, Devon, the daughter of Roger Rice Alford a Methodist preacher and mayor of Tavistock. When their engagement was announced in The Times, Stearn was vastly amused to see that he was described as a \\"Fellow of the Linen Society\\", a typographical error for Linnean Society. Stearn was brought up an Anglican, but was a conscientious objector and after the Second World War he became a Quaker. In his later years, following official retirement in 1976 he continued to live in Kew, Richmond. His entry in Who's Who lists his interests as \\"gardening and talking\\". He died on 9 May 2001 of pneumonia at Kingston Hospital, Kingston upon Thames, at the age of 90. His funeral took place on 18 May at Mortlake crematorium. He left three children (Roger Thomas Stearn, Margaret Ruth Stearn and Helen Elizabeth Stearn) and an estate of ¬£461,240. His wife, whose 100th birthday was celebrated at the Linnean Society in 2010, lived to the age of 103. Professor Stearn had a reputation for his encyclopedic knowledge, geniality, wit and generosity with his time and knowledge, being always willing to contribute to the work of others. He had a mischievous sense of fun and was famous for his anecdotes while lecturing, while his colleagues recalled that \\"he had a happy genius for friendship\\". He was described as having a striking figure, \\"a small man, his pink face topped with a thatch of white hair\\", and earned the nickname of \\"Wumpty\\" after his signature of \\"Wm. T. Stearn\\". Career = Cambridge years (1929‚Äì1933) = While working at the bookshop he made many friends among the Cambridge botanists and participated in their activities, including botanical excursions. In addition to Professor Seward, those influencing him included the morphologist Agnes Arber, Humphrey Gilbert-Carter the first scientific director of the Botanic Garden, John Gilmour then curator of the university herbarium and later director of the Garden (1951‚Äì1973), the horticulturalist E. A. Bowles (1865‚Äì1954), who became his patron, Harry Godwin, then a research fellow and later professor and Tom Tutin who was working with Seward at that time. Seward gave him full research facilities in the herbarium. He continued his research, visiting the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, in 1930, at the age of 19, and also spent two weeks at the herbarium of the Mus√©e National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, with the aid of a ¬£15 grant from the Royal Society to study Epimedium. Also in 1930, the Fifth International Botanical Congress was held at Cambridge, and Stearn was able to attend. During this time he commuted between the bookshop, the Botany School, Botanic Garden and home by bicycle, his preferred means of transportation throughout his life. = Lindley Library, Royal Horticultural Society (1933‚Äì1952) = In 1933, H. R. Hutchinson, who was the Librarian at the Lindley Library, Royal Horticultural Society's (RHS) in London, was due to retire. John Gilmour, now assistant director at the Kew Gardens, put forward Stearn's name, together with Bowles, a vice-president of the Society, who had discovered Stearn at the bookshop. Stearn was 22 when he began work at the library, initially as assistant librarian, before taking over Hutchinson's position after six months. He later explained his appointment at such a young age as being the result of World War I: \\"All the people who should have had those jobs were dead.\\" There he collaborated with Bowles on a number of plant monographs, such as Bowles' Handbook of Crocus and their work on Anemone japonica (Anemone hupehensis var. japonica). Written in 1947, it is still considered one of the most comprehensive accounts of the origins and nomenclature of fall-blooming anemones. Stearn was one of the last people to see Bowles alive, and when Bowles died, Stearn wrote an appreciation of him, and later contributed the entry on Bowles to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Much of his spare time was spent studying at the Kew Gardens. The Lindley Library, the largest horticultural library in the world and named after the British botanist John Lindley (1799‚Äì1865), was established in 1868 by the acquisition of Lindley's 1,300 volumes upon his death. It had recently undergone considerable change. In 1930, the library had been rehoused in a new floor added to the society's Vincent Square headquarters, but the role of the library was somewhat downgraded. Frederick Chittenden had been appointed as Keeper of the Library (1930‚Äì1939), and Hutchinson reported directly to him. Stearn related that when he reported for duty, Hutchinson was completely unaware of the appointment of his new assistant. Lindley was one of Stearn's inspirations, also being a librarian who had a long association with the RHS. Lindley also bequeathed his herbarium to the Cambridge University Herbarium, where it now forms the Lindley Collection. As Stearn remarked \\"I came to know his numerous publications and to admire the industry, tenacity and ability with which he undertook successfully so many different things\\". Later Stearn would publish a major work on Lindley's life and work. Lindley's contributions to horticultural taxonomy were matched only by those of Stearn himself. Stearn soon set about using his antiquarian knowledge to reorganise the library, forming a pre-Linnean section. Not long after his arrival the library acquired one of its largest collections, the Reginald Cory Bequest (1934), which Stearn set about cataloguing on its arrival two years later, resulting in at least fifteen publications. While at the library he continued his self-education through evening classes, learning Swedish, and travelling widely. Stearn used his three-week annual leaves in the pre-war years to visit other European botanical libraries, botanic gardens, museums, herbaria and collections, as well as collecting plants, with special emphasis on Epimedium and Allium. His travels took him to Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and Sweden.  War years (1941‚Äì1946)  The only break from this employment was the war years 1941‚Äì1946, leaving his assistant Ms. Cardew as acting librarian. Initially Stearn served as an air raid warden, before enlisting. As a conscientious objector, he could not serve in a combatant role, but was accepted into the Royal Air Force (RAF) Medical Services, as he had previously worked with the St John Ambulance Brigade. He served in the RAF in both England, and Asia (India and Burma, where he worked in intelligence, and was awarded the Burma Star). While there he undertook studies of Indo-Malayan and Sikkim-Himalayan tropical vegetation, carried out botanical explorations, taught biology to troops and began work on his Botanical Latin. His wartime observations led to collaborative publications such as An enumeration of the flowering plants of Nepal (1978‚Äì1982), Beautiful Indian Trees (2nd ed. 1954), as well as works on Himalayan species of Allium. On returning from the war, Stearn and his new wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, were obliged to live in the Lindley Library for a while till they found a more permanent home, due to the acute housing shortage in London. =Natural History Museum (1952‚Äì1976)= From the Lindley Library, Stearn (see 1950 Photograph) moved to the Botany Department at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington in 1952, and by the time he retired in 1976, he was the Senior Principal Scientific Officer there. He had now achieved his aim of becoming a research scientist, despite lack of formal qualifications, enabling him to spend more of his time collecting and studying plants. During this time the museum was undergoing steady expansion, with new staff and programmes. At the museum he was put in charge of Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the Dicotyledons in the Bentham & Hooker system, i.e., Monochlamydae) and floristic treatment of the regions of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including work on the museum's Flora of Jamaica and the Nepal flora he started work on during the war. Seven volumes of the Flora of Jamaica had appeared prior to the Second World War. Although the project was revived after the war, and Stearn carried out six months of field work in Jamaica, it never came to fruition; no further volumes appeared. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the footsteps of Sir Hans Sloane (1660‚Äì1753), whose collection had been left to the Natural History Museum. Stearn's generic work at the museum concentrated on Allium, Lilium and Paeonia. He continued to travel widely, with field work in Europe (particularly Greece), Australia, and the United States, and published 200 papers during his twenty-four years at the museum, and although the library was not his responsibility, he spent much time there adding written notes to many of the critical texts. While at the museum, Stearn became increasingly involved in the work of the Linnean Society during his Kensington years. He was also offered the George A. Miller professorship of botany at the University of Illinois (1966), but felt he would be unable to leave his commitments in London. At the time of his retirement in 1976, he was still using a fountain pen as his only means of communication and scholarship, a fact commemorated by his retirement present of a Mont Blanc pen capable of writing for long periods without refills. =Retirement (1976‚Äì2001)= Following his retirement on 30 November 1976 he continued to work, both at the museum and at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, where his home at 17 High Park Road, Kew Gardens, Richmond (see image), gave him access to the herbarium and library, a short bicycle trip away. Indeed, 35 percent of his total publications appeared in the quarter century of his retirement. He was commissioned to write a history of the museum for its centenary (1981), although he did so with some difficulty, due to deadlines and budget constraints. The task, which took three years, was made more difficult for him by the museum's decision to censor his critical comments. He continued his association with the Lindley Library all his life, being an active committee member and regularly attended RHS flower shows even after he was barely able to walk.  Sojourn in Greece  alt=Goulandris Natural History Museum, Athens As a student of the classics he was passionate about Greece, its mountains and plants (such as Paeonia) and all things Greek, both ancient and modern. The Stearns had formed a friendship with Constantine Goulimis and Niki and Angelos Goulandris, founders of the Goulandris Museum of Natural History in Kifissia, Athens. Stearn first met the Goulandris' in 1967, and offered practical help with their museum. He also stayed with them when he and his wife visited Greece. Niki Goulandris illustrated both Wild Flowers of Greece that Goulimis and Stearn wrote in 1968, as well as his Peonies of Greece (1984). The latter work typified Stearn's encyclopedic approach, including topics such as mythology and herbalism in addition to taxonomy. Stearn then took on the editorship of Annales Musei Goulandris, the scientific journal of the museum (1976‚Äì1999), succeeding Werner Greuter, the first editor, having been instrumental in getting the journal launched in 1973. Eldwyth Ruth Stearn took on the job of compiling the indexes. When he retired from this position he was 88, and was succeeded by John Akeroyd. He was a liberal contributor to the journal, and during this time he and Eldwyth Ruth Stearn undertook their translation of The Greek Plant World in Myth, Art, and Literature (1993). =Societies and appointments= Stearn was a member of the Linnean Society for many years, becoming a fellow as early as 1934. He served as botanical curator 1959‚Äì1985, council member 1959‚Äì1963 and as vice-president 1961‚Äì1962 and president 1979‚Äì1982, producing a revised and updated history of the society in 1988. He also served as president of the Garden History Society and the Ray Society (1975‚Äì1977). The Royal Horticultural Society had made him an honorary fellow in 1946 and in 1986 he became a vice-president. Stearn became a member of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) in 1954, joining the Maps Committee the following year to prepare their Atlas of the British Flora (1962). He remained on that committee till 1968, when it became the Records Committee. For 40 years he was the BSBI referee for Allium. While at the Lindley Library, he became a founding member of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History (later, the Society for the History of Natural History) in 1936, was one of its most active publishing members based on his cataloguing work at the library, and published a history of the society for their 50th anniversary in 1986. Other societies on which he served include the British Society for the History of Science (vice-president), the British Society for the History of Medicine (Council), the Garden History Society (president 1977‚Äì1982) and was a corresponding member of the Botanical Society of America. Stearn was appointed Sandars Reader in Bibliography, University of Cambridge in 1965 and from 1977 to 1983 he was visiting professor at Cambridge University's Department of Botany, and also Visiting Professor in Botany at Reading University 1977‚Äì1983, and then Honorary Research Fellow (1983‚Äì). He was also a fellow of the Institute of Biology (1967) and honorary fellow, Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. Work William Stearn was the author of nearly 500 publications, including his autobiography. These included monographs, partial floras, books on botanical illustration, scholarly editions of historical botanical texts, dictionaries, bibliographies and botanical histories. =Early years= alt=Flowers and leaves of Epimedium alpinum alt=Flowers of Allium farreri During Stearn's initial four years in Cambridge (1929‚Äì1933), he published twenty-four papers, predominantly in the Gardeners' Chronicle and Gardening Illustrated and the Journal of Botany, his first in 1929. While working as a gardener's boy during school holidays he had observed a specimen of Campanula pusilla (Campanula cochleariifolia) with a distorted corolla. He then described and published the first appearance of the causative agent, the mould Peronospora corollaea, in Britain, using the facilities of the Botany library. At the Botanic Garden he developed a special interest in Vinca, Epimedium, Hosta and Symphytum, all of which he published monographs on. A series of botanical publications followed, starting with a new species of Allium (A. farreri Stearn, 1930). Stearn repeatedly returned to the genus Allium, and was considered a world expert on it; many species bear his name. 1930 would also see his first bibliographic work, on the botanist Reginald Farrer, whom he named Allium farreri after, and also described Rosa farreri (1933) and other species named after Farrer. It was while he was compiling Farrer's works in 1930 that he came across the latter's work, The English Rock-Garden (1919) and its account of Barren-worts (Epimedium), and kindled a lifetime interest in the genus. From 1932, he produced a series of papers on this genus, studying it at Cambridge, Kew and Paris. It became one of the genera which he was best known, and many species of which now bear his name. Epimedium and the related woodland perennial Vancouveria (Berberidaceae) would be the subject of his first monograph (1938) and were genera to which he would return at the end of his life. At the time the taxonomy of this genus was very confused, and with the help of the Cambridge Herbarium he obtained specimens from all over Europe to produce a comprehensive monograph. The work was so thorough that it was mistakenly considered a doctoral thesis by other botanists. He also began a series of contributions to the catalogue of the Herbarium, together with Gilmour and Tutin. =Later work= After moving to London, Stearn produced a steady output of publications during his years at the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library (1933‚Äì1952). These covered a wide range of topics from bibliography to plant nomenclature, taxonomy and garden plants, with a particular emphasis on Vinca, Epimedium and Lilium. Within two years of joining the library in 1933, he had produced his first major monograph, Lilies (1935), in collaboration with Drysdale Woodcock and John Coutts. This text, in an expanded and revised edition, as Woodcock and Stearn's Lilies of the World (1950) became a standard work on the Liliaceae sensu lato. While at the library he also continued his collaboration with his Cambridge colleagues, publishing catalogues of the Herbarium collections, including the Catalogue of the Collections of the Herbarium of the University Botany School, Cambridge (1935). The second task imposed on him at this time involved the RHS role in maintaining revision of the Code of Botanical Nomenclature (see Botanical taxonomy). After his return to London in 1946, at the end of the Second World War, a number of major publications ensued, including Lilies of the World in 1950. The RHS also imposed two major tasks on their librarian. In 1950, Frederick Chittenden, a previous director of RHS Wisley and Keeper of the Library, died leaving unfinished the four volume RHS Dictionary of Gardening that the society had commissioned from him before the war. The war had interrupted the work as many of the expected contributors were unavailable. Stearn, together with Patrick Synge, the RHS Publications Editor, undertook to complete the work, particularly volume IV (R‚ÄìZ), a task he completed within six months, with 50 new articles. The finished work was published in 1951 and not only did he undertake the role of editing this large work but his contributions covered 50 genera, 600 species and complex identification keys such as Solidago and Viola. Since Stearn's entries in volume IV extended from Soldanella to Zygotritonia, he would jest that he was but \\"a peculiar authority on plants from 'So-' onwards\\". He issued a revised version in 1956 with Synge in which he added a further 86 articles. His recollection of this task was that he acquired \\"that occupational hazard of compilers of encyclopaedias\\", encyclopedic knowledge. Many of Stearn's collaborative works used his bibliographic skills. While his genus monographs largely concentrated on Mediterranean flora, notably Epimedium, Allium and Paeonia, he was also the author of species articles both popular and technical as well as a number of classical treatises. In addition he produced floristic treatments of a number of regions such as Jamaica and Nepal. He also contributed to many national Florae as diverse as Bhutan and Greece, as well as major regional florae including the Flora Europaea and European Garden Flora. While his output covered a wide range of topics, he is best known for his contributions to botanical history, taxonomy, botanical bibliography, and botanical illustration. Botanical Latin (four editions 1966‚Äì1992), is his best known work, having become a standard reference and described as both the bible of plant taxonomists and a philological masterwork. It was begun during the war years and the first edition was basically a guide to Latin for botanists with no or limited knowledge of the language, which he described as a \\"do-it- yourself Latin kit\\" for taxonomists. Later, the work evolved into an etymological dictionary, but then Stearn learned that such a work had already been published in the Netherlands before the war. He then continued to expand it with the assistance of his wife and son, systematically collecting botanical terms from botanical texts. It is said that only he could have written this work, which explains not just the derivation of plant names but also the philological principles involved in forming those names. The work is considered responsible for the continued survival of Latin as the lingua franca of botany. In addition to this seminal text, he frequently delighted in the illumination that the classics could add to understanding plants and plant lore, such as his Five Brethren of the Rose (1965). His best known popular work is his Dictionary of Plant Names, which found its way into the libraries of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses of his work at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including Botanical Latin and Dictionary of Plant Names and translating German botanical history into English. Just before his death he completed a revision of his original Epimedium monograph. Botanical history alt=Portrait of John Lindley c. 1865 William Stearn wrote extensively on the history of botany and horticulture, from Ancient Greece to his own times. He collected together J. E. Raven's 1976 J. H. Gray Lectures, editing and annotating them as Plants and Plant Lore in Ancient Greece (1990). In 1993, he and Eldwyth Ruth Stearn translated and expanded Baumann's Die griechische Pflanzenwelt in Mythos, Kunst und Literatur (1986) as The Greek Plant World in Myth, Art, and Literature. Stearn compiled a major work on the life of John Lindley and produced an edited version of the classic book on herbals by Agnes Arber, one of the influences of his Cambridge years, and whose obituary he would later write for The Times. He also wrote a number of histories of the organisations he worked with as well as a number of introductions and commentaries on classic botanical texts such as John Ray's Synopsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum (1691), together with historical introductions to reference books, including Desmond's Dictionary of British and Irish Botanists (1994). In his Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century (1961), Stearn provides some insight into his interpretation of botanical history: > The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of > so many factors that undue emphasis on any one can give a very distorted > impression of the whole, but certainly among the most important of these for > any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the > assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends the extent > to which a particular study attracts an unbroken succession of men of > industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and > communicating it successfully to others of like mind. =Linnaeus= alt=Linnaeus in 1775 Stearn's historical research is best known for his work on Carl Linnaeus (1707‚Äì1778), which he began while at the Natural History Museum, and which won him a number of awards at home and abroad. Between 1953 and 1994 he produced more than 20 works describing Linnaeus' life and work. Of Stearn's writings on Linnaeus, the most well known is his edition of the 1753 Species plantarum, published in facsimile by the Ray Society in 1957, for which he wrote both a 176-page introduction and an appendix. Concerned that Linnaeus' methods were imperfectly understood by his contemporaries, Stearn wrote that his introduction \\"provided concisely all the information about his Linnaeus' life, herbaria, publications, methodology etc. which a botanical taxonomist needs to know\\". The Times stated that no other botanist possessed the historical knowledge and linguistic skills to write, what is considered one of the classic studies of the Swedish naturalist and a highpoint of 20th century botanical scholarship. Subsequently, Stearn became a recognised authority on Linnaeus. Stearn produced similar introductions to a number of other editions of Linnaeus' works, including Genera Plantarum, Mantissa plantarum and '. Later, he would produce a bicentenary guide to Linnaeus (1978) for the Linnean Society. Although Stearn spent much of his life studying and writing about Linnaeus, he did not admire the man's character, describing him as mean‚Äî\\"a jealous egoist, with a driving ambition\\". When asked which botanists in history he did admire, he cited John Lindley, Carolus Clusius (1526‚Äì1609) and Olof Swartz (1760‚Äì1818). Botanical taxonomy Stearn made major contributions to plant taxonomy and its history. In 1950 the Seventh International Botanical Congress was held in Stockholm, and the RHS would have been represented by Chittenden, but he had been taken ill. Bowles then arranged for Stearn and Gilmour to represent the society in his stead. The congress appointed a special committee to consider nomenclatural issues related to cultivated plants, which became known as the Committee for the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants (the \\"Stockholm Committee\\"), with Stearn as secretary (1950‚Äì1953). Stearn then proposed an International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (the \\"Cultivated Code\\"), producing the first draft that day. The code was accepted in principle by the committee, conditional on its approval by a parallel committee of the International Horticultural Congress (the Horticultural Nomenclature Committee), which would next meet in London in 1952 (the \\"London Committee\\"). Later that year Stearn was also appointed secretary of the London Committee so that he now represented both organisations. The two committees then met jointly on 22‚Äì24 November 1951 at the RHS building in London to draft a final joint proposal that was published by Stearn as secretary of an editorial committee and adopted by the 13th International Horticultural Congress the following year. The resulting code was formulated as a supplement to the existing International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Stearn introduced two important concepts, the terms \\"cultivar\\" and \\"grex\\". Cultivar, a term first proposed by L. H. Bailey in 1923, refers to a distinctive genus or species variety raised or maintained in cultivation, such as Euphorbia dulcis \\"Chameleon\\". Grex (Latin for \\"flock\\" or \\"herd\\") refers to a group of hybrids of common parentage, such as Lilium Pink Perfection Group. These concepts contributed a similar clarity to the nomenclature of garden or agricultural plants that Linnaeus had brought to the naming of native plants two centuries earlier. Stearn continued to play an active part in the International Botanical Congresses over many years, where he was remembered for his rhetorical persuasion on nomenclatural matters. He was also a pioneer in the application of computer-aided technology to (numerical taxonomy), as in his work on Columnea (1969). Botanical bibliography Motivated by his interest in botanical history and taxonomy, Stearn devoted a considerable part of his output to botanical bibliography, including numerous papers and catalogues establishing the exact publication dates of books on natural history, particularly from the early nineteenth century, including William Herbert's work on Amaryllidaceae (1821, 1837) and complete bibliographies of botanists such as John Gilmour (1989). At the RHS library he transformed the minimalist card indexing by introducing British Museum rules and adding extensive bibliographic information. He quickly realised that one of the major deficits in contemporary taxonomic nomenclature was a lack of precise dates of all the names, and set about rectifying this over a fifteen-year period, resulting in 86 publications, which was a major step in stabilising nomenclature. The importance of this lay in the rules of botanical nomenclature, which gives botanical names priority based on dates of publication. He considered his most important contribution in this regard to be his elucidation of the dating of the early 19th century collection of studies of Canary Islands flora by Webb and Berthelot (1836‚Äì1850). Another important work from this period was on Ventenat's Jardin de la Malmaison (1803‚Äì1804), also published in the new Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History. In a number of instances his contributions to others' work went unacknowledged, particularly when he was younger, even though his introductions (often with the title \\"Revised and enlarged by W. T. Stearn\\") could be as lengthy as the texts they preceded. His contributions to botanical bibliography and in particular the correct interpretation of historical texts from Linnaeus to Arber are considered of central importance to the field of taxonomy. Botanical illustration alt=Black and White engraving of Acacia cunninghamii in the Florilegium Within a few years after Stearn returned from the war, his Art of Botanical Illustration (1950) was published, remaining the standard work on the subject to this day. There was, however, some bibliographic confusionCollins, the publisher, had planned a book on botanical art for its New Naturalist series, but mistakenly commissioned both Stearn and the art historian Wilfred Blunt independently to produce the work. After the error was discovered the two decided to collaborate; Blunt wrote the work while Stearn edited and revised it. When it was published, Blunt's name was on the title page, while Stearn was only acknowledged in the preface. The omission was not rectified till he prepared the second edition in 1994, although the preface reveals Stearn's extensive contribution. His continuing interest in botanical illustration led him to produce work on both historical and contemporary artists, including the Florilegium of Captain Cook and Joseph Banks from their first voyage to the Pacific on the Endeavour, the similar account of Ferdinand Bauer's later botanical expedition to Australia with Matthew Flinders on the Investigator (1801‚Äì1803), and the work of illustrator Franz Bauer (the brother of Ferdinand). Stearn's studies of Ferdinand Bauer's Flora Graeca (1806‚Äì1840) enabled him to combine his passion for Greece with that of illustration. Other illustrators of this period that he wrote about included William Hooker. Awards William Stearn received three honorary doctorates during his lifetime, from Leiden (D.Sc.1960), Cambridge (Sc.D.1967), and Uppsala (Fil.Dr.1972). He was the Masters Memorial Lecturer, Royal Horticultural Society in 1964. In 1976 the Linnean Society awarded him their Gold Medal for his contributions to Linnean scholarship and taxonomic botany. In 1985 he was the Wilkins Lecturer of the Royal Society, entitled Wilkins, John Ray, and Carl Linnaeus. In 1986 he received the Founder's Medal of the Society for the History of Natural History and in 1993 he received the Engler Gold Medal from the International Association for Plant Taxonomy. The Royal Horticultural Society awarded him both their Veitch Memorial Medal (1964) and Victoria Medal of Honour (VMH, 1965). In 2000 he received the Asa Gray Award, the highest honour of the American Society of Plant Taxonomists. Stearn was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1997 Birthday Honours for services to horticulture and botany. He was well regarded in Sweden for his studies on Linnaeus, and possessed a good grasp of the language. In addition to his honorary doctorate from Uppsala, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded him their Linnaeus Medal in 1972, he was granted the title of Commander of the Swedish Order of the Star of the North (Polar Star) in 1980 and admitted to membership of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1983. Stearn was also elected to membership of the Swedish Linnaeus Society. Legacy Stearn is considered a preeminent British botanist, and of equal stature with botanical scholars such as Robert Brown, Darwin, the Hookers (William and Joseph) and Frans Stafleu. He has been variously described as a Renaissance man, a polymath, \\"the modern Linnaeus\\", \\"the great Linnaean scholar of our day\\", \\"one of the world's greatest botanists\\" and a giant among botanists and horticulturalists. On his death, The Times noted his encyclopedic grasp of his field, stating that he was \\"acknowledged as the greatest botanical authority of the twentieth century\\". One description that Stearn rejected, however, was \\"the complete naturalist\\"an allusion to the title of his biography of Linnaeus. His contribution to his field was far greater than his extensive bibliography suggests, since he was known for his input into many of his colleagues' work, leading Professor P. B. Tomlinson to observe \\"he left no tome unstearned\\". The Society for the History of Natural History of which he was a founding member has created the William T. Stearn Student Essay Prize in his honour. =Eponymy= Stearn is the botanical authority for over 400 taxa that bear his name, such as Allium chrysonemum Stearn. Many plants have been named (eponymy) after him, including the orchid nothogenus hybrid √óStearnara J. M. H. Shaw. A number of species have been designated stearnii after William Stearn, including: *Allium stearnii Pastor & Vald√©s *Berberis stearnii Ahrendt *Epimedium stearnii Ogisu & Rix *Justicia stearnii V.A.W. Graham *Schefflera stearnii R.A.Howard & Proctor In light of his work on Epimedium, a cultivar was named in his honour in 1988, Epimedium 'William Stearn'.

History of Freemining For hundreds of years, mining of the Forest of Dean Coalfield and iron reserves has been regulated through a system of Freemining, with the Free Miner's Mine Law Court sitting at the Speech House from 1682. The earliest known existing copy of Dean Miners‚Äô Laws and Privileges, known locally as the Book of Dennis, dates from 1610 but the copy itself contains references to much earlier origins. It also claims that Freemining rights were granted to Foresters by Edward I who, in so doing, also confirmed that such 'customes and franchises' had existed since 'tyme out of mynde'. Freeminers had been instrumental in recapturing Berwick-upon-Tweed several times (1296, 1305 and 1315) and it is thought that these privileges were granted as a reward for their endeavours. A plaque bearing the engraved coat of arms of the Freeminers is on the Greyndour tomb in the Clearwell Chapel in Newland church, and other important medieval and modern mining emblems are in the Freeminers Guild church of St. Michael in Abenhall. Towards the end of the 18th century, as the industrial revolution began to take hold, increasing demand for coal and iron led to conflicting mining interests and the Mine Law Court became bogged down with disputes. Deep coal and iron reserves could not be mined without substantial investment and the Crown became determined to introduce the free market into the Forest. In 1777 Mine Law Court documents mysteriously disappeared from the Speech House where they were stored and the Court fell into disarray. Most of the Court documents were later found to have been in the possession of local Crown officials (Deputy Gavellers), and they were produced as evidence at an Inquiry some 50 years later. A Royal Commission was appointed in 1831 to inquire into the nature of the mineral interests and freemining customs in the Forest of Dean, leading to the passing of the Dean Forest Mines Act 1838, which now forms the basis of Freemining law. It confirmed the Freeminers' exclusive right to the minerals of the Forest of Dean, but also allowed Freeminers to sell their gales to a non-Freeminers, weakening the Freeminer's control and opening up the Forest to outside industrialists. The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, of 1946, specifically exempted the Forest of Dean, due to its unique form of ownership and history, allowing Freemining privileges to continue intact. Some large colliery gales were subsequently compulsorily purchased by the National Coal Board (NCB), but these remained under the Freemining system, with a royalty paid to the Freeminers, by the NCB, as a share of the minerals extracted. The last of the NCB deep mines closed in 1965.  Eligibility  > \\"All male persons born or hereafter to be born and abiding within the said > Hundred of St Briavels, of the age of twenty one years and upwards, who > shall have worked a year and a day in a coal or iron mine within the said > Hundred of St Briavels, shall be deemed and taken to be Free Miners.\\" the > Dean Forest (Mines) Act 1838. This qualification has recently been challenged on the grounds of sex discrimination and although legal opinion advised that the 1838 Act was not subject to Equal Rights legislation, the Forestry Commissioners who act as Gaveller of the Forest of Dean made the decision to enter females onto the register for the first time in 2010. It is now understood that the qualification of \\"male\\", also incorporates \\"or female.\\" The ancient administrative district, known as the \\"Hundred of St Briavels\\", is generally considered to be the whole of the statutory Forest of Dean and each parish adjoining it. And, as of 2010, the gender requirement has been recognised as archaic and women are now allowed to become freeminers. Present day The Dean Forest Mines Act is the basis for Free Mining today and Freemining is administered by the Deputy Gaveller; a post established in Medieval times, recently held by Chartered mining engineer John Harvey MBE (retired March 2011), and succeeded by Daniel Howell. There are probably still around 150 Freeminers alive today, although only a handful of collieries are still operating, due to the demanding nature and relatively high costs of small- scale extraction; the closure of maternity hospital facilities at the Dilke Hospital - so that it has become unusual to be born within the \\"Hundred of St Briavels\\" - and attempts by the UK government to exact commercial coal mining licence charges under the 1994 Coal Act adds further difficulties. Despite the modest level of activity, some Freemines do operate successfully, especially through diversification into non-traditional areas such as tourism and ochre mining. Freemining continues to be an important aspect of Forest of Dean culture and an important part of local identity.

In reality he may be a fictional character created by Karl Decker for an article that ran in a 1932 issue of the Saturday Evening Post, and passed off as a real person. There is also very little evidence that Valfierno actually existed, or if he did, that he was involved in the theft of the Mona Lisa at all. Theft of the Mona Lisa The Mona Lisas vacant space at The Louvre after its theft in 1911. Valfierno's account was relayed by reporter Karl Decker, in the Saturday Evening Posts ‚ÄúWhy and How the Mona Lisa Was Stolen,‚Äù June 25, 1932.' According to Decker, Valfierno had provided details of the theft in confidence; to be published only after his death.The Lost Mona Lisa by R. A. Scotti (Random House, 2010) According to that account, in 1910, Valfierno had conspired with Chaudron to steal the Mona Lisa and produce copies of the painting which would then be sold to private buyers as the genuine painting. The plan had been to sell each copy as the \\"original\\" while the location of the real painting was unknown.Leonardo's Lost Princess: One Man's Quest to Authenticate an Unknown Portrait by Leonardo Da Vinci by Peter Silverman & Catherine Whitney (John Wiley & Sons, 2011) Chaudron, \\"spent the winter of 1910 creating clones of Leonardo's great portrait\\" while Valfierno made arrangements to steal the real painting.The Man Who Stole the Mona Lisa Robert Noah (St. Martin's Press, 1998) In the early hours of 21 August 1911, Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia and two accomplices carried the Mona Lisa out of the museum covered in a painter's smock.The New Encyclopedia of American Scandal by George C. Kohn (Infobase Publishing, 2001) Chaudron's copies Decker asserts that six Chaudron copies had already been sent to the United States ahead of the theft and while the stolen original remained in France, Valfierno followed his fakes and sold each for up to 300,000.Leonardo. Ediz. inglese by Enrica Crispino (Giunti Editore, 2002) The original remained hidden for two years until Peruggia, presenting himself as Leonardo Vincenzo, tried to sell it in Florence, Italy. A museum administrator there was suspicious, reported the attempted sale and Peruggia was arrested. The original Mona Lisa was returned to the Louvre in 1913. More than 100 years later, none of these six paintings has ever surfaced, bringing into question if they ever in fact existed. Further, the only evidence that the \\"famed forger\\" Yves Chaudron even existed is Karl Decker's 1932 Saturday Evening Post article. There are no known photos of the man or relatives or any biographical details outside of this incident. None of his other forged works has ever come to light, and it is quite impossible to be a 'famed forger' if none of your forgeries is discovered. Decker's entire 1932 article may be a work of fiction that, much like forgeries in the art world, has fooled many who have read it. Later life According to Valfierno's account, the mysterious Chaudron retired to the countryside only months after the theft and the completion of the forgeries. He is said to have continued to produce forgeries of other artists' work , but never to the same scale as his work related to the Mona Lisa theft. Again, no works by Chaudron, forged or otherwise, have ever been located. As Valfierno's account was only released in 1932 (some years after the supposed death of Chaudron), there was no arrest or trail of the mysterious forger and his role in the theft was effectively unknown during his lifetime, only being revealed in the 1932 article. Yves Chaudron was most likely a creation of Karl Decker that fit well into a story of a criminal mastermind and his associates, that readers of the article assumed was genuine. His name still pops up in lists of the top forgers of the 20th century, despite there being no forged works of art found that can be attributed to anyone named Chaudron.

On account of the valiant conduct of his father, Thomas, who died in 1339 in battle at the storming of Hunycourt in Vermandois, France, the King received Michael's homage, though the latter was under age, and granted him livery of his lands and full benefit of his marriage, taking security for the payment of the relief. Rayment stated that Thomas de Poynings was summoned to Parliament 23 April 1337, Leigh Rayment: Peers - Poynings which would indicate that he was the first baron, but Cokayne held a contrary position, which is that Thomas was summoned to 'a council of prelates and magnates'. The leadership of Thomas at the storming of Hunycourt and the Michael's direct feudal obligations to the king are evidences of a prior feudal barony. So some historians number the first barony from Thomas, while most consider Michael to be the first baron.

They received 20,504 votes. Marra had also been a candidate in the Republican and Democratic parties' United States presidential primary in New Hampshire. In the former he received six write-in votes and in the latter received 142 votes. Biography Dr. William A. Marra was born in Jersey City, New Jersey on February 20, 1928 of Italian immigrant parents. He grew up in Jersey City, but attended the Jesuit Regis High School in New York City. He was a graduate of the University of Detroit Mercy School of Engineering and Fordham University, serving as a professor of philosophy at the latter for nearly four decades. Marra was an active lecturer, opposing topics such as abortion, atheism and sex education. For 17 years, Marra hosted a radio program called \\"Where Catholics Meet\\" on 710 WOR-AM in New York City. On the show, he addressed issues facing orthodox Catholics in the post-Vatican II world. He often had guests. In the early 1990s, Marra hosted a TV program on the EWTN Global Catholic Network called \\"The Roman Forum.\\" This program ran for two seasons and addressed many of the same issues as \\"Where Catholics Meet\\", but involved fewer guest hosts. Marra founded Catholic Media Apostolate, an organization dedicated to the propagation of the Roman Catholic faith through the media. He was also heavily involved in Keep the Faith, an organization similar to CMA. In 2003 his daughter Lorretta Marra Malvasi was convicted of assisting James Charles Kopp subsequent to Kopp's killing of Barnett Slepian, a physician who legally performed abortions in New York State.

He attended Tufts College in 1943, and became part of the V-12 program stationed in Honolulu, Hawaii from 1943 to 1945. He returned to Tufts at the end of WWII and attended Tufts University School of Medicine, graduating there in 1952.Highes, P (2000) 'Victor A. Prather'. http://dca.lib.tufts.edu/features/nrotc3/8.html In 1954, Prather rejoined the United States Navy in the Navy Medical Corps. He was stationed in Pensacola and then transferred to San Diego, CA. While at San Diego, Prather completed courses in Aviation Medicine and qualifications in fixed wing and helicopter aircraft. He was stationed as a medical doctor aboard the aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La until 1957, when he was assigned to the U.S. Naval Air Station in Port Lyautey, Morocco as Flight Surgeon for VR-24. In 1959, Prather was reassigned to the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. Project RAM In 1960, Prather was transferred to Project RAM, a government program to test prototype space suits, at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. He was commissioned to test how the suits worked underwater, and later commissioned to see how the suits would function at extremely high altitudes. The flight On May 4, 1961, at 7:08 am, Victor Prather, along with Cdr. Malcolm Ross, ascended in Strato-Lab High V from the flight deck of the USS Antietam (CV-36) to an altitude of 113,720 feet (34,668 meters) to test the Navy's Mark IV full-pressure suit.National Archives (1961) 'USN 1054273'. https://www.history.navy.mil/our- collections/photography/numerical-list-of-images/nhhc-series/nh- series/USN-1054000/USN-1054273.htmlRyan, C (2012) 'Daredevil descents: Free- falling from space  New Scientist'. https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528741-700-daredevil-descents-free- falling-from-space/ The balloon, built by Winzen Research Inc. of Minneapolis, Minnesota, was constructed of polyethylene plastic only thick. The balloon envelope was the largest that had ever been successfully launched, expanding to in diameter when fully inflated. Beneath the balloon hung a large parachute and then the gondola. To control temperature, the gondola was protected by special venetian blinds, but otherwise open to space. Balloon, parachute, gondola, and a trailing antenna made a craft close to tall. The primary objective of the flight was to test the Mark IV full-pressure suit. The suit was manufactured by B. F. Goodrich of neoprene and weighed only . The Mark IV suit overcame problems of weight, bulk, ventilation, air and water tightness, mobility, temperature control, and survival capabilities so well that NASA selected a modified version for use by the Project Mercury astronauts. Malcolm Ross and Victor Prather were exposed to temperatures as low as when they passed at 8:10 am. Strato-Lab V reached maximum elevation of at 9:47 am, where the temperature was and the air pressure was . At that altitude without a space suit, a person would lose consciousness in seconds. The May 4 flight was the most severe test of the Mark IV suit that was ever conducted. The flight lasted 9 hours 54 minutes and covered a horizontal distance of . As they descended, the balloonists opened their face masks when they reached an elevation where they could breathe. Strato-Lab V landed at 4:02 pm in the Gulf of Mexico. The mission plan was to use a boat to retrieve the balloonists in the event that the gondola landed in the water instead of on the flight deck of the carrier. This had been rehearsed. However, without orders to do so, the crew in a hovering helicopter lowered a hook. Commander Ross invited Prather to go first, but he declined. Ross stepped into the hook contrary to proper procedure and slipped partially out of it, but he was able to recover without falling completely into the water. A few minutes later, when a hook was lowered to retrieve Prather, he stood on a float attached to the gondola and grasped the rescue line. When he stepped into the hook, the trailing foot pushed the gondola away, and he fell backwards three feet into the water. The helicopter crew assumed that the flight suit was watertight, which it would have been if the face plate was still closed, and did not effect an immediate rescue. Because the face plate was open, Prather's flight suit flooded, and he drowned before Navy divers could rescue him.Balloon Ride to the Edge of Space, by Malcolm Ross and Walter Edwards, National Geographic Magazine, November 1961 After the flight Shortly after Prather's death, President John F. Kennedy phoned Prather's widow, Virginia Merritt, and she arrived at the White House with her children, Marla Lee Prather and Victor A. Prather III. Kennedy posthumously awarded Victor Prather the Navy Distinguished Flying Cross for 'heroism and extraordinary achievement'. The balloonists were also awarded the 1961 Harmon Trophy for Aeronauts. The altitude record for a manned balloon flight set by Prather and Ross in 1961 is still officially recognized by F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale. three people have traveled higher into the stratosphere. Nicholas Piantanida, claimed to have reached 123,800 feet (37,643 m) with his Strato Jump II balloon on February 2, 1966 and Felix Baumgartner, reached 128,100 feet (39 044.88 meters) on 14 October 2012 as part of the Red Bull Stratos project. In ballooning, as in mountain climbing, completing the descent by the same method is required to set a record. Piantanida did not claim the balloon altitude record because he jettisoned his balloon at the flight ceiling and returned to Earth in the gondola without the balloon. Similarly Baumgartner jumped at the apex of his flight. The third person, Alan Eustace, reached an altitude of 136,000 ft where he then performed a supersonic jump in 2014.

Plot The show stars Fraidy \\"Nine\\" Cat (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer), an unlucky and miserable cat who, like all cats, has nine lives, but has used up eight of them and is on his ninth and last life, where he wants to make it last. The main joke of the series is that as if Fraidy's life was not miserable enough, every time Fraidy inadvertently says out loud any single- digit number (from one to eight), or any word or any part of a word that rhymes with or sounds the same as the number's name in any language, a ghost from one of his former lives will appear and mistakenly tend to make things even worse for the hopeless cat. The ghosts are: # Elephunt Cave \\"One\\" Cat (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) - A prehistoric saber-toothed tiger with a caveman motif. He owns a huge pet Apatosaurus named \\"Ant\\" (voiced by Lennie Weinrib). # Kitty \\"Two\\" Wizard (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) - A befuddled magician whose wand was often on the wrong setting. # Captain \\"Three\\" Kitt (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) - A pirate who is the self-proclaimed \\"buccaneer's buccaneer\\". # Sir Walter \\"Four\\" Cat (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) - A foppish Elizabethan nobleman who is also an expert swordsman. # Billy \\"Five\\" the Kit (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) - A western cowboy. He is a small guy with a very loud voice. # Jasper \\"Six\\" Catdaver (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) - An undertaker who actually prefers to expedite Fraidy's passing to the \\"Other Side\\", though not out of spite. He is ironically the least troublesome of the ghosts. # Captain Eddie \\"Seven\\" Kittenbacker (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) - A pilot who is a very erratic flier. # Hep \\"Eight\\" Cat (voiced by Lennie Weinrib) - A zoot-suited jive-talking street cat. # Cloud Nine (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer) - As accidentally saying a number from one to eight gets Fraidy a ghost, as if to fill the void towards his last life, saying \\"nine\\" calls forth an ominous, malevolent storm cloud (shaped like the number nine) which immediately gives chase after Fraidy, attempting to blast him with bolts of lightning until Fraidy manages to either outrun the cloud or its (supposedly) limited time it can stay expires. Each short begins with all eight ghosts appearing around Fraidy who says to the audience about his life: \\"Every kitty has nine lives. But eight of mine went fast. Now there's only one life left, and I want to make it last!\\" Cloud Nine appears and he starts running. Then he morphs into the yellow-lined cat's name which its letters said it was at the end of the intro. Whenever terrified by some dangerous situation, Fraidy often exclaims: \\"This kitten's splitting!\\" Episodes The last six episodes were never made, due to the cancellation of Uncle Croc's Block. Production One of the few original series (outside of an adaptation) to be produced by Filmation; Fraidy was later syndicated as part of the Groovie Goolies and Friends series. Home media All 12 Fraidy Cat episodes were released by Boulevard Entertainment on two DVD volumes in the 2000s, and later by BCI on a compilation DVD called Frightfully Funny: Volume Two, which also included episodes of Groovie Goolies and Filmation's Ghostbusters.

Band history and the American Recordings era  Initially playing gigs for free at New York City's famed Continental nightclub, their occasional shows became a residency and by the following year, Kennedy Lustig and Snyder had signed a record deal with American Recordings. Their debut 1995 album was titled Laughing Gallery, which was seen with critical acclaim from those who heard it. The album was co-produced by Ted Nicely, who has produced Fugazi, Girls Against Boys and Kennedy separately. The song \\"Uninvited\\" from the album gained them some success, including alternative radio play and a few months of MTV rotation. The band then toured nationally with Everclear and No Doubt while also headlining shows and making several television appearances in the United Kingdom. Unhappy with the label's handling of their album, in 1996 the band began to break away by releasing a 45 single on Deep Elm Records titled \\"Brainiac\\" with the flipside \\"Love Potion No. 10,\\" produced by Kennedy, as well as a critically acclaimed EP from Epitaph Little Death, again produced by Kennedy and Brett Guerwitz. Before the EP was released, however, Snyder left the group, replaced by drummer Christian Nakata. A video created for the song \\"Jerome\\" remains unreleased. Headline tours and support tours with Spacehog, Everclear and Samiam followed.  The RCA records era  In 1997, the band recorded new material while still under contract to American. RCA Records A&R; rep Brian Malouf, after seeing the band play a show at the Continental, expressed interest in signing the group. RCA paid American for the unreleased masters and they resurfaced in 1998 on RCA with Are You My Friend? with the addition of Michael Kotch of the band Eve's Plum on rhythm guitar. The title of the album was a direct, if unflattering quote from their A&R; contact at American, and a song from the album titled \\"Kaboom\\" (with lyrics such as \\"now you're dead and I'm happy\\") was said to have been written in celebration of their escape from their relationship with American Recordings. The song \\"Condition\\" was featured in the film Urban Legend. AYMF? was co-produced by Kennedy and Chris Shaw.  The 2000s and a new name - 'Ultra-V'  In 2000 the band recorded new material for RCA which was released under the band name Ultra-V. The album, Bring on the Fuego, co-produced by Kennedy and Matt Wallace represented a departure stylistically from Ruth Ruth. Bassist Maggie Kim joined the group for a handful of shows. The song \\"Shut Your Mouth\\" was featured in the film Joyride. \\"Can I Crash Here Tonight?\\" was featured in the TV show Roswell. Shortly after the album's release, however, the group disbanded. In 2010, Kennedy collaborated with Kid Rock on a re-write of the Ultra-V song, \\"Playboy Mansion,\\" entitled \\"Cucci Galore.\\" \\"Cucci Galore\\" is on Kid Rock's album, Rebel Soul, released November 19, 2012.  Return to Ruth Ruth  In 2004, Kennedy, Lustig and Nakata reunited and released the album Right About Now, produced by Kennedy and released on their own label Flaming Peach Records. The album was critically well received and the band performed a handful of shows in New York City as well as the 9:30 Club in Washington D.C. with Everclear, but shortly thereafter, the group inexplicably disbanded once again. In 2009 the Ruth Ruth album Live in Toronto was released on In Music We Trust Records, a live recording culled from a 1996 CBC broadcast and was also very well received. Although there has been some mention in passing by Kennedy on the band's Facebook page about reformation, only they know if the band will get together. In 2016 Ruth Ruth decided to reform and recruit longtime friend and drummer Johnny Powers and continue to play shows in the NYC area.

The maleo is endemic to Sulawesi and the nearby smaller island of Buton in Indonesia. It is found in the tropical lowland and hill forests, but nests in the open sandy areas, volcanic soils, or beaches that are heated by the sun or geothermal energy for incubation. Names It is known as Tabonan (in M'ranaw language) or igwuk in the Abinomn language of Papua, Indonesia. Description The maleo ranges from long with blackish plumage, bare yellow facial skin, reddish-brown iris, reddish-orange beak, and rosy salmon underparts. The crown is ornamented with a prominent, bony, dark casque - which is the origin of its genus name Macrocephalon (Macro meaning \\"large\\" and cephalon meaning \\"head\\"). The greyish blue feet have four long sharp claws, separated by a membranous web. The sexes are almost identical with a slightly smaller and duller female. Juvenile birds have largely brownish and paler heads with short blackish-brown crests and browner upperparts.  Behaviour and ecology  The maleo's egg is large, about five times as large as that of the domestic chicken's. The female lays and covers each egg in a deep hole in the sand and allows the incubation to take place through solar or volcanic heating. After the eggs hatch, the young birds work their way up through the sand and hide in the forest. The young birds are able to fly and are totally independent. They must find food and defend themselves from predators such as monitor lizards, reticulated pythons, wild pigs, and cats. The maleo is monogamous and members of a pair stay close to each other all the time. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, seeds, mollusks, ants, termites, beetles, and other small invertebrates.  Breeding and habitat  This species is endemic to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It is usually not present on altitudes exceeding 1,000 meters and is usually found in lowland hills or rain forests. Ideal nesting locations include river banks, lake shores, and coastal areas of the island. Maleos are communal nesters. Maleos breed all year round, but peak breeding season varies depending upon the location on the island. When prepared to lay her eggs, the female maleo, accompanied by her mate, will leave the cover of the Sulawesian forest in search of historic coastal breeding grounds. Females can lay anywhere between 8-12 eggs over the course of a year. Once an optimal spot is chosen, the maleos dig a deep hole and lay the egg inside. After the egg is laid, the parents bury the egg securely in sand, sometimes covering the sand with other debris to better camouflage the hole. After the egg has been securely buried, the parents leave and never return, leaving the maleo chick to fend for itself. The hot sand of Sulawesi acts as an incubator for maleo eggs, which are warmed with geothermal heat or solar heat. A maleo chick is completely self-sufficient only hours after hatching. For this reason, maleo eggs are approximately five times the size of a domestic chicken's, as they contain nearly full-formed maleos inside. It must dig its way up through the sand immediately after birth and subsequently has the ability to fly and feed itself.  Current threats and conservation  A large number of former nesting sites have been abandoned as a result of egg poaching and land conversion to agriculture. Of the 142 known nesting grounds, only 4 are currently considered non-threatened. The shrinking and fragmentation of forest habitats on the island pose serious threats to the surviving and future populations of the species. Wildfires in 2000 and 2004 cleared large areas of forest and what grew as a result of these fires was not a suitable habitat for the maleo. There has also been increasing isolation between non-breeding habitats and coastal breeding grounds as a result of human urban development. Because of this, mortality risk associated with moving to breeding grounds has drastically increased. Since 1972, this species has been protected by the Indonesian government. As of 2005, it is estimated that only 4,000-7,000 breeding pairs currently exist in the wild and these numbers are rapidly declining. Due to aforementioned threats, current population numbers, and deemed value of the species, the maleo is evaluated as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. In 2009, US-based Wildlife Conservation Society worked with local government to purchase 36 acres (150,000 m2) of Indonesian beach front property where approximately 40 nests are located in an effort to further conservation efforts and protect this bird. Thanks to Alana O'Sullivan, a Senior Keeper of Ornithology, the Bronx Zoo is the only place in the world where the maleo exists outside of Indonesia and breeding efforts are currently taking place there as well. A breeding pair of maleos at the Bronx Zoo were featured in an episode of the Animal Planet show The Zoo. O'Sullivan appeared and talked about the species and the threats they face. She also lamented that most people don't know they exist. Details about the maleo not yet mentioned include having an elaborate courtship ritual and loving peanuts. It's easy to tell when the female will lay her egg because she will lose interest in everything else, including peanuts, and at that point the keepers know she will lay her egg within the next 24 hours. The Alliance for Tompotika Conservation works with communities in Sulawesi to educate locals about the maleo's endangered status and prevent the harvesting of eggs. The eggs are not a staple food source, but are a popular delicacy.

The divided highway extends from the Sawgrass Expressway in Coral Springs to State Road A1A in Pompano Beach. It serves as the latitudinal baseline for the street grid for the city of Pompano Beach. The portion of the boulevard west of U.S. Route 441 is locally maintained as County Road 814. Route description =County Road 814= Atlantic Boulevard begins its eastward journey from the Sawgrass Expressway in Coral Springs. The road meanders through residential zones before it arrives at its intersection with University Drive, where Coral Square is located. Afterward, SR 814 borders the former CDP of Ramblewood East. Ramblewood Middle School is located there, from the SR 817 intersection. The road continues eastward, passing by apartment buildings and a golf course before its intersection with US 441 (SR 7) in Margate. Conflicting signage on Atlantic Boulevard does not clearly show the location of SR 814's western terminus. County Road 814 shields still exist at the US 441 intersection, but State Road 814 shields were erected at the Sawgrass Expressway interchange upon the exit's opening. In 2009, overhead signs were erected at the intersection of University Drive and Atlantic Boulevard, which designate the road as County Road 814. The official FDOT county highway map also shows SR 814's western terminus and CR 814's eastern terminus located at US 441\\\\. There are similar conflicts with other east-west roads which terminate at the Sawgrass Expressway; however, there are no County Road shields present on those roads, and they are thus unsigned. =State Road 814= SR 814 begins at US 441, and has an intersection with Lyons Road, another major north-south corridor, later. Soon after, the road accesses an interchange with Florida's Turnpike south. Drivers who wish to take Florida's Turnpike north are directed to SR 849, the extension of Atlantic Boulevard. After the interchange with the Turnpike, SR 814 enters Pompano Beach, where the road becomes the latitudinal baseline for the city's street grid. Soon after, SR 814 intersects Andrews Avenue (which has the hidden designation of County Road 811A) and Interstate 95, followed by Florida State Road 811 (Dixie Highway. The intersection with Dixie Highway is the center of Pompano Beach's street grid. Immediately paralleling Dixie Highway is the Florida East Coast Railway, which carries the Virgin Trains USA service. One block north of Atlantic Boulevard is the site of a proposed Tri-Rail station. Afterward, SR 814 has one more major intersection with US 1 (Federal Highway) before its eastern terminus at SR A1A (Ocean Boulevard), just before the Atlantic Ocean. History From 1945 until the early 1970s, all of Hammondville Road (State Road 912) was the original State Road 814, which continued eastward to State Road A1A on Atlantic Boulevard after a short zigzag involving North Dixie Highway (State Road 811). From the early 1970s to about 1983, State Road 814 between Florida's Turnpike and Dixie Highway was rerouted along the entirety of Atlantic Boulevard. This alignment of State Road 814 lasted about a decade, before the western end of State Road 814 was rerouted onto a westward extension of Atlantic Boulevard. The north-south section along Northwest 31 Avenue was redesignated State Road 849 by Florida Department of Transportation, and Hammondville Road became Coconut Creek Parkway (State Road 912). Around the year 2000, State Road 912 was returned to Broward County control and converted to County Road 912. In 2016, Atlantic Boulevard east of Blanche Ely Avenue was transferred to the City of Pompano Beach, with the exception of the S.C. Fox Memorial Bridge, along with SR 811 within the city limits, in exchange for a $4,562,065 fee paid by FDOT.

Initiated after the War of 1812, it became most famous for its production of Parrott rifle artillery and other munitions during the Civil War, although it also manufactured a variety of iron products for civilian use. The increase of steel making and decreasing demand for cast iron after the Civil War caused it to become bankrupt gradually and cease operations during the early 20th Century. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs History =Founding and early products= The establishment of the foundry was encouraged by President James Madison, who, after the War of 1812, wanted to establish domestic foundries to produce artillery. Cold Spring was an ideal site: timber for charcoal was abundant, there were many local iron mines, and the nearby Margaret's Brook provided water power to drive machinery. The site was guarded by West Point, across the Hudson River, and the river provided shipping for finished products. The West Point Foundry Association was incorporated by Gouverneur Kemble, who was of a merchant family in New York City (his mother's family had associations in Putnam County), and the foundry began operation in 1817. Artillery was tested by shooting across the Hudson at the desolate slopes of Storm King Mountain (which would later have to be swept for unexploded ordnance as a result after some of it exploded during a 1999 fire). The platform used for mounting artillery for proofing was uncovered during Superfund work in the early 1990s. Besides artillery, the foundry also produced iron fittings for civilian uses, such as pipe for the New York City water system and sugar mills for shipment to the West Indies. A number of early locomotives were built at the foundry, including the Best Friend of Charleston (the first to be put into commercial service), the West Point (the third built for service in the United States), the DeWitt Clinton (the fourth, and first to operate in New York state), Phoenix, and Experiment. =Parrott years and the Civil War= In 1835, Captain Robert Parker Parrott, an 1824-graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, was appointed as an inspector of ordnance at the foundry for the U.S. Army. The following year he resigned his commission and on October 31, 1836, was appointed superintendent of the foundry. It prospered over his long tenure, and was the site of numerous experiments with artillery and projectiles, culminating in his invention of the Parrott rifle cannon in 1860. In 1843 the foundry also manufactured the USS Spencer, a revenue cutter which was the first iron ship built in the U.S.A.. The foundry was busiest during the American Civil War due to military orders: at that time it had a workforce of 1,400 people and produced 2,000 cannon and three million shells. Parrott also invented an incendiary shell which was used in an 8-inch Parrott rifle cannon (the \\"Swamp Angel\\") to bombard Charleston. The importance of the foundry for the war effort can be measured by the fact that President Abraham Lincoln visited and inspected it in June 1862. The fame of the foundry was such that Jules Verne, for his novel From the Earth to the Moon, chose it as the contractor for the Columbiad, a spaceship-launching cannon. =Decline and demise= In 1867, Parrott resigned as superintendent, although he continued to experiment with artillery designs until his death in 1877. Business of the foundry decreased due to competition from more modern techniques of iron and steel production. It had discontinued the use of charcoal and begun to purchase coal from Pennsylvania about 1870. However, it was unable to avoid receivership in 1884 and bankruptcy in 1889. It was sold in 1897 to the Cornell brothers, makers of sugar mills, and ceased operation in 1911.

The current scientific name of \\"Ipomopsis\\", Latin for \\"similar to Ipomoea\\" or morning glories, refers to its similarities between the morning glories' similar red tubular flowers. \\"Aggregata\\", \\"brought together\\" in Latin refers to its petal growing pattern. Common names include scarlet gilia, scarlet trumpet, and skyrocket.. The potent smell from glands within its basal leaf formations grant it the name skunk flower. In some areas it is also called honeysuckle, owing to the shape of the flower and the droplet of nectar that can be enjoyed by picking off the flower and sucking it out of the basal end. The common name of Gilia (once a component of its scientific name) is pronounced \\"Jee-lee-uh\\", an Italian pronunciation, after its original namesake, Italian scientist and clergyman Filippo Luigi Gilii. Distribution Ipomopsis aggregata is characterized by the USDA as a native species for the continental United States and Canada.It is native to western North America, growing mainly in the central to western regions and ranging from as far north as British Columbia to Mexico. Physical characteristics Ipomopsis aggregata has characteristic red, trumpet-shaped flowers and basal leaves stemming from a single erect stem. Depending on elevation, height can range from 12 inches, in Rocky Mountain alpine areas, to over 5 feet, in areas of southern Texas. Trumpet flowers can range from white, red, orange-red, and pink. Pink flowers are especially common in high mesa areas of Colorado, such as the Flat Tops, Grand Mesa, or the Uncompahgre Plateau. Yellow flowers have been reported for plant but are extremely rare. Fernlike leaves are low to the ground, helping encourage warmth in colder areas, and have silver specks and a fine white pubescence. A well known delicacy in nature, Ipomopsis aggregata is well adapted to herbivory, as it can regrow multiple flowering stalks once lost. Although herbivory initially reduces seed and fruit count of the plant, intermediate herbivory and its stimulating factors could lead to the plant growing larger over time. Elk and mule deer are common herbivores on Ipomopsis aggregata. Ipomopsis aggregata Wildflower Identification Page, Photos Life history Ipomopsis aggregata is pollinated most commonly by long-tongued moths and hummingbirds, although others can be seen. Basal leaves overwinter, even in subalpine areas of the Rocky Mountains. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer, and into fall if weather conditions are favorable. Optimal growing conditions include little water, part shade, and sandy soil. Although defined as hermaphroditic, Ipomopsis aggregata has shown sex allocation in flowering months, with phenotypic sex reaching a proportion of 0.77 female components to male. Current research The plant is currently being used to better understand pollination factors. Researchers used fluorescent particles on flowers to create pollen analogs to track pollinating hummingbirds. This ultimately gains insight into cross pollination techniques carried out by pollinating bodies. Further, it is a model for pollinator- mediated selection and spatial genetic patterns.

Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 155  Early life and academic career  Although the place where Sanches was actually born is still disputable, it certain he was baptised in Braga, Portugal, on July 25, 1551, and spent his childhood there. Despite this official document of birth implies he was born in Portugal, Sanches lately would have stated he was born in Tui, in Galicia, Kingdom of Galicia (now Spain). His father was the Spaniard Antonio Sanches, also a physician; and his mother Filipa de Sousa was Portuguese.Francisco Sanches (ca 1551-1623) Fil√≥sofo, matem√°tico e m√©dico ‚Äì Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal (in Portuguese) Being of Jewish origin, even if converted, he was legally considered a New Christian. He studied in Braga until he was 12 years old, when he moved to Bordeaux with his parents, escaping the surveillance of the Portuguese Inquisition. There he resumed his studies at the College de Guyenne. He went on to study medicine in Rome in 1569, and, back in France, in Montpellier and Toulouse. He ended up, after 1575, as a professor of philosophy and medicine at the University of Toulouse. His house in Toulouse  Main work and thought  In his Quod nihil scitur (That Nothing Is Known), written in 1576 and published in 1581, he used the classical skeptical arguments to show that science, in the Aristotelian sense of giving necessary reasons or causes for the behavior of nature, cannot be attained: the search for causes quickly descends into an infinite regress and so cannot give certitude. He also attacked demonstrations in the forms of syllogisms, arguing that the particular (the conclusion) is needed to have a conception of the general (the premises) and thus that syllogisms were circular and did not add to knowledge.Popkin, Richard H., The History of Scepticism, from Erasmus to Spinoza, University of California Press: Berkeley, 1979, Statue of Francisco Sanches, by Salvador Barata Feyo in Braga. Perfect knowledge, if attainable, is the intuitive apprehension of each individual thing. But, he then argued, even his own notion of science (perfect knowledge of an individual thing) is beyond human capabilities because of the nature of objects and the nature of man. The interrelation of objects, their unlimited number, and their ever- changing character prevent their being known. The limitations and variability of man's senses restrict him to knowledge of appearances, never of real substances. In forming these last argument he drew on his experience of Medicine to show how unreliable our sense experience is. Sanches' first conclusion was the usual fideistic one of the time, that truth can be gained by faith. His second conclusion was to play an important role in later thought: just because nothing can be known in an ultimate sense, we should not abandon all attempts at knowledge but should try to gain what knowledge we can, namely, limited, imperfect knowledge of some of those things with which we become acquainted through observation, experience, and judgment. The realization that nihil scitur (\\"nothing is known\\") thus can yield some constructive results. This early formulation of \\"constructive\\" or \\"mitigated\\" skepticism was to be developed into an important explication of the new science by Marin Mersenne, Pierre Gassendi, and the leaders of the Royal Society.

Released in Germany for Microsoft Windows in February 2001, in the United Kingdom in March, and in North America in August, it is the fourth game in The Settlers series, following The Settlers (1993), The Settlers II (1996) and The Settlers III (1998). In August, Blue Byte released an expansion, The Settlers IV Mission CD, featuring new single- player campaign missions, new maps for both single-player and multiplayer modes, a random map generator and map editor, gameplay improvements, and bug fixes. In December, they released a second expansion, The Settlers IV: The Trojans and the Elixir of Power (), containing new single-player campaigns, additional single and multiplayer maps, improved graphics, and additional gameplay tweaks. In March 2002, The Settlers IV: Gold Edition was released, containing the original game and both expansions, plus fan-made maps for multiplayer mode, and two minigames. In November 2009, Gameloft ported the original game to iOS, under the title The Settlers. Although featuring updated graphics and utilising touch controls, the gameplay, game mechanics and storyline are identical to the original. In April 2010, The Settlers was released for webOS, specifically optimised for the Palm Pre. Gameloft later released HD versions for iPad, bada, Symbian and Android. In 2013, the Gold Edition was released on GOG.com. In 2018, the game was re-released as The Settlers IV: History Edition. In the game's single-player campaign, the player controls three races (Romans, Vikings and Mayans) as they initially fight one another, before joining forces to combat the much greater threat posed to each of them by the exiled god Morbus, who has been banished to Earth after instigating a failed rebellion against the great god, HE. Unable to bear touching foliage, Morbus leads the mysterious Dark Tribe as he sets about attempting to erase all natural greenery from the planet's surface. The Trojans and the Elixir of Power takes place many centuries later, when the war against the Dark Tribe has faded from memory, and the three victorious civilisations have returned to fighting with one another. However, when Morbus once more proves a threat, attempting to permanently cure his allergy of greenery by creating a powerful elixir, it falls to the Trojans to unite the others, and stand against him and the Dark Tribe. Acting on feedback from fans who had felt Settlers III was too focused on combat, the designers aimed for a return to the core supply and demand-based gameplay of the first two titles in the series. As a result, the game was designed to strike a balance between economic planning and military conquest. Although the basic gameplay remains relatively unchanged from Settlers III, some of the game mechanics have been altered. For example, for the first time in the series, the offensive strength of the player's military is tied to the economic value of their settlement; the player has access to each rank of soldier from the beginning of each mission, with the ability to select the rank of every soldier prior to recruitment; the game's single-player campaign focuses on a race that cannot be defeated solely by military means; and specialty units and squad leaders have been added to enhance the tactical aspects of combat, with warships also made available, allowing for combat at sea. The Settlers IV received mixed reviews, with most critics feeling it was too similar to The Settlers III, and many opining that Blue Byte had failed to steer the gameplay away from an over-reliance on combat. Although the graphics and animations were generally praised, the AI, mission variety, and limited combat strategy were criticised, with reviews comparing the game unfavourably to titles such as Age of Empires II and Zeus: Master of Olympus. The handheld version received more positive reviews, and was lauded for replicating the original game on a portable device, and for successfully adapting the controls to a touchscreen. The most common criticism concerned the lack of free play and multiplayer modes. Gameplay The Settlers IV is a real-time strategy game with city-building elements, controlled via a point and click interface. The general gameplay and game mechanics are very similar to The Settlers III, and the primary goal on most maps is to build a settlement with a functioning economy, producing sufficient military and/or specialist units so as to conquer rival territories. To achieve this end, the player must engage in economic micromanagement, construct buildings, and generate resources. =Game modes= The game can be played in one of two modes; single-player or multiplayer. In single-player mode, the player can play either campaign missions or individual non-campaign games (\\"Free Maps\\"). In campaign mode, the player must complete a series of missions, the goal of most of which is to defeat the computer controlled opponent or opponents by gaining possession of their territory, or, in the case of the Dark Tribe, by destroying their temple using gardeners. In the original release of the game, there were three separate campaigns of three missions each (one campaign each for the Romans, Vikings, and Mayans), and a fourth campaign of twelve missions in which the player controls all three races as they fight against the Dark Tribe. The Mission CD expansion added three additional campaigns of five missions for each race, plus three \\"Settlement\\" missions and three \\"Conflict\\" missions. The Trojans and the Elixir of Power expansion added three campaigns of four missions for each of the original three races, four Settlement missions, and a new campaign of twelve missions in which the player controls the Trojans against the Dark Tribe. In Free Maps and multiplayer mode, which can be played via a LAN or online, the player chooses the map on which to play, and then refines the game in various ways, such as adjusting the number of computer controlled opponents, the amount of raw materials available at the start of the game, and/or the victory conditions. The player can also select the type of game to be played, choosing from \\"Conflict Mode\\" (each player/race competes against one another), \\"Ranking List\\" (players receive points at the end of the game for ranking on Blue Byte's online league table); \\"Cooperation Mode\\" (players combine forces to achieve a predetermined objective against computer controlled races), \\"Economic Mode\\" (the winner is the player to produce the most goods in at least four out of seven categories within a time limit), \\"Settlefest\\" (players compete on separate, but identical, single-player maps to be the first to reach a given objective), or \\"Free Settle Mode\\" (one player/race). =Settlers and transportation= Whether playing single-player or multiplayer mode, each game begins the same way; the player has a small settlement, a set amount of raw materials and tools, and a predetermined number of settlers. The basic gameplay revolves around serfs (the titular \\"settlers\\"), who transport materials, tools and produce, and who populate and perform the requisite task of each building. As in The Settlers III, new settlers can only be acquired by the construction of residences. At no point does the player directly control any normal settler - instead, general orders are issued (such as ordering the construction of a building), with the AI handling the delegation of orders to specific settlers. However, the player can control specialist settlers, of which there are four types; pioneers (extend the player's territory by digging at the border), thieves (scout enemy territory and steal resources), geologists (test mountainous ground for raw materials), and gardeners (reclaim terrain corrupted by the Dark Tribe). When playing a multiplayer game, the player also has access to a fifth specialist unit; the Saboteur, who can attack and destroy all enemy buildings, not just military installations. As in The Settlers III, players do not have to construct a road network. Instead, settlers can walk freely around the player's territory, with the AI handling pathfinding. Like all previous games in the series, The Settlers IV has an adjustable goods priority system, which determines the order in which items are transported. Players can also build marketplaces, which allow for the establishment of trade routes between areas on the same geographical region, and shipyards, which allow for the manufacture of warships, ferries (can transport specialist settlers, soldiers and war machines) and trade ships (can transport items from a landing dock to a different geographical region). =Races and economy= In the original game, the player controlled three races; Romans, Vikings and Mayans. The Trojans and the Elixir of Power added the Trojans as a fourth race. As in Settlers III, each race has a slightly different economic model. For example, the Romans' and Trojans' construction industries require roughly equal amounts of wood and stone, the Vikings' more wood than stone, and the Mayans' more stone than wood. Each race also has specific skills; for example, only the Romans can produce manna using only two buildings; only the Vikings can build war machines and warships which use manna rather than physical ammunition; and only the Mayans can utilise desert terrain (to grow agave plants necessary for the production of tequila). The economy is under the player's control throughout the game. For example, the player can control the distribution of goods by selecting which percentage of a given resource is transported to a given building. In a similar manner, the player can select what tools are made when. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a mine, and the building is still empty despite the presence of idle settlers, a pickaxe will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith. The game also uses a notification system that alerts the player if a building cannot be occupied either due to a lack of the right tool or the absence of available settlers. As in The Settlers III, the game features magic, whereby each race can call upon their deities for economic and/or military assistance. Once the player has both manna and priests, they have finite access to a number of spells, the nature of which depends on the race. These spells include tuning fish to stone, turning enemy soldiers to allies (Romans), turning stone to iron, temporarily freezing enemies (Vikings), turning wood to gold, turning enemy bowmen into butterflies (Mayans), turning sulphur to iron, and turning enemy soldiers into normal settlers (Trojans). =Military= The player's territory can only be expanded by using pioneers or building a military complex near the territory border. Each complex must have at least one soldier garrisoned for the territory to expand. To recruit soldiers, the player must build a barracks, with each individual soldier requiring their requisite weapon to transition from settler to soldier. The player can also build lookout towers, which are manned by regular settlers, and which can see for great distances, but don't grant new territory. Screenshot of The Settlers IV, showing terrain corrupted by the Dark Tribe, which can only be reclaimed by using gardeners on the affected areas. The context menu on the left shows the player has selected a single level 2 bowman, and their army's offensive strength is at 111%. There are three classes of soldier common to all races: swordsmen, bowmen and squad leaders. The level of swordsmen and bowmen is set by the player prior to recruitment, with both types of soldier having three ranks, determined by the amount of gold necessary for recruitment (no gold for Level 1, one gold bar for Level 2 and two gold bars for Level 3). Squad leaders are available in only one rank, and require a sword, a suit of armour and three gold bars to recruit. As well as being stronger and having more health than a Level 3 swordsman, they also affect the troops around them; improving their formations, increasing their combat strategy, and enhancing their abilities. Additionally, if the player assigns a squad leader to a group of soldiers, orders need to be issued to the squad leader only; the squad will automatically follow him to the destination ordered by the player. Each race can also produce warships, war machines (catapults for the Romans, magical lightning generators for the Vikings, canons for the Mayans, and ballistae for the Trojans), and special military units (medics for the Romans, axe warriors for the Vikings, blowgun warriors for the Mayans, and backpack catapultists for the Trojans). As with swordmen and bowmen, special military units have three levels of recruitment. In order for the player to attack an enemy building, they must click near that building with soldiers selected. If the player's units defeat all soldiers stationed in the building, they will occupy it, with the player's territory increasing according to the building's radius. Defense of the player's military buildings is automatic; as enemies attack, any soldiers stationed in the building defend. Any nearby soldiers will also defend the building, unless ordered not to. When soldiers are fighting within their own territory, their strength is always 100%. When they are fighting outside, their strength is tied to the economic value of the settlement itself. Of especial importance in improving the strength of one's army are \\"Eyecatchers\\" (decorative monuments), which are worth double their construction value in relation to the player's military strength. Plot The game begins shortly after the failure of a rebellion instigated by the dark god Morbus against the great god HE. For his treachery, HE banishes Morbus to Earth, Morbus's most hated place in the universe, due to its vast amounts of greenery. Unable to bear touching foliage, Morbus determines to destroy all of Earth's plant life. His dark gardener eventually develops a substance known as shadow-weed, which sucks the energy out of the land, killing all nearby foliage, and transforming the terrain into a blackened wasteland; the Dark Lands. Meanwhile, unaware of the presence of Morbus, a war is raging between three races who have recently come into contact with one another; the Romans, the Vikings and the Mayans. The first to encounter the Dark Lands are the Romans, whose scouts return word of the effects of shadow-weed, which they initially believe to be a new Mayan weapon. As a result, the Romans attack and destroy a nearby Mayan colony, but quickly realise the Dark Lands are not the Mayans' doing. When the Mayans, who have also encountered the Dark Lands, suggest a temporary alliance, the Romans reluctantly agree. However, as they begin to investigate the Dark Lands further, the Mayans turn on them. Elsewhere, the Vikings also encounter the effects of shadow-weed, when they discover one of their most sacred burial grounds surrounded by the Dark Lands. Setting out to reclaim their territory, they are attacked by an army of mindless soldiers. Nearby, the Romans learn the secret of how the Dark Army is created - human settlers are converted by Shamans into servants of Morbus, thus forming the Dark Tribe. They are then put to work on mushroom farms, converting mushroom spores into manna, which is transported to the nearest Dark Temple, where it is used to create the Dark Army. With this clearer understanding of the Dark Tribe, the Romans ally with the Vikings, and determine to destroy the farms. However, the Mayans see the alliance between the Romans and the Vikings as a direct threat. Only after attacking colonies belonging to both do they realise the alliance was not focused on attacking them, but on combating the Dark Tribe. By this time, however, they find themselves surrounded by the Dark Lands. Despite their previous animosity, the Romans and the Vikings save the Mayans, and the three unite, going on the offensive in an effort to wipe out the Dark Tribe. Eventually, the Vikings locate what they believe to be the final Dark Temple. They destroy it, but the remnants of the Dark Tribe survive, and rally for a final battle. Secure in the knowledge that one more victory is all that is required, the Mayans launch an attack. They prove victorious, and with all of the Dark Tribe's temples and farms eradicated, and no way of breeding new troops, Morbus retreats to his lair. Begging HE for mercy, Morbus is horrified to see vines infesting the building, quickly wrapping themselves around him, and turning him to stone. =The Trojans and the Elixir of Power= The Trojans and the Elixir of Power begins many centuries after the events of the main game. Morbus remains in a petrified state in territory now controlled by the Trojans, who are unaware of the other races, of Morbus's identity, or of the war against the Dark Tribe. The story begins when Morbus's assistant, Q'nq√ºra, spreads shadow-weed around the statue, releasing him. When the Trojans discover the statue gone and the effects of shadow-weed spreading, they elect to abandon the area. Landing on a new island, they encounter friendly Romans and hostile Mayans. Allying with the Romans, the Trojans tell them of the disappearance of Morbus's statue, and the Romans tell them the history of the war, and call a meeting of all four races. They are all shocked, however, when they learn the Dark Tribe are now using aerial vehicles, dubbed manacopters, to easily infiltrate their lines and inflict huge losses. After the Romans, Vikings, and Mayans are all attacked, the Trojans are tasked with destroying the Dark Tribe's research lab and, with it, the manacopter blueprints. When they raid the lab, however, they discover Morbus's plan; his dark gardeners are attempting to create an elixir to cure his inability to touch greenery by using a complex combination of herbs, and are only one herb from a final breakthrough. The four races divide the land up into sectors to search for the final herb, and shortly thereafter, the Vikings locate it. Their priests begin to harvest it, but the Dark Tribe soon arrive, and the Trojans develop a poison to use on the herb should the Vikings be unable to harvest it in time. The Viking priest is ambushed and killed, and the Dark Tribe acquire the herb. However, it remains unclear if the priest was able to use the poison before his death. Meanwhile, Morbus's temple is located, and the Trojans lead an assault. They succeed in destroying it, but not before Morbus is able to create and drink the elixir. Emerging from the ruins of his temple to see the greenery surrounding it, he laughs and declares \\"nothing can stop me now.\\" The game then cuts to some time later; on the site of the temple now stands a small cottage with a garden full of blooming flowers. Morbus then emerges from the cottage and happily attends to his garden, fully cured of his hatred of foliage. Development =Announcement and gameplay= The Settlers IV was announced by Blue Byte at the ECTS in August 1999. However, Volker Wertich, who had created The Settlers series, and designed and programmed both the original Settlers and The Settlers III, would not be involved in development, because, as he later explained, \\"Blue Byte wanted to have it ready for release by Christmas 2000, which, in my opinion, was not sufficient time to create a worthy title.\\" The game was first shown at the E3 event in May 2000, where Blue Byte stated that gameplay would emphasise economic planning over military conquest. Citing negative feedback from fans who felt Settlers III was too combat-orientated, the designers intended the new game as a return to the core supply and demand- based gameplay of The Settlers and The Settlers II. They also revealed the game would feature three playable races (Romans, Vikings and Mayans) and a new non-playable race (the Dark Tribe). Speaking of the importance of the Dark Tribe to the economic-based gameplay, project manager and co-designer Hans- J√ºrgen Br√§ndle explained, In an interview with GamesZone, Br√§ndle further stated, \\"we have made sure there is a balance between settling and combat with virtually every rule change and new feature.\\" Addressing why the game would feature nearly identical economic processes as Settlers III despite the refocused gameplay, he explained, \\"the majority of the feedback gave us a clear understanding that the economy in Settlers is simply great as it is, and that the game should not be artificially inflated with new goods or people. The fun, the ease of playing, should not be overwhelmed by unnecessarily complex contexts.\\" Speaking to IGN later in the year, Br√§ndle reiterated the designers' hopes that the game would more fully integrate economic-based settling with combat than had the previous title; Of the three races in the game, Br√§ndle explained the developers chose the Romans as they were a \\"traditional\\" Settlers race, the Vikings as they were the most fan-requested race, and the Mayans as they needed a race than used more stone than wood in their construction industry, and because the developers felt that the Mayans are a somewhat historically mysterious culture. =Graphics= In the GamesZone interview, Br√§ndle also addressed the issue of the similarity in graphics between the new game and Settlers III, explaining, \\"we have deliberately programmed an engine that is very much like the previous one. We wanted to make the fans feel like they were back in the familiar world of The Settlers.\\" As with Settlers III, the buildings in the game were created using 3D Studio Max, with Adobe Photoshop used to create the textures. Each race was assigned their own specific artist, who worked on nothing except the buildings for that particular race. According to lead artist/co-designer/co-writer Torsten Hess, this was done \\"so that the style of the buildings within a people is uniform.\\" However, there were certain overriding rules to which the individual artists had to adhere. One of the most important was a technique Hess had employed on Settlers III; after the textures were applied, they were \\"dirtied\\" so as to create a lived-in, real-world sense. Hess explains, \\"rigid and straight edges should be avoided. Beautiful curves and moving lines are instead used to suggest life in the settlers world. For the textures, this means stronger colours, a slightly higher contrast than the figures, as well as a lot of detail and the use of many different colour families. We definitely want to avoid a sterile look. We also draw all the textures by hand.\\" For the settlers themselves, the designers also used the same basic techniques as developed on Settlers III; the figures couldn't be too graphically complex, since small details would be lost, given their size (32 pixels in height). However, at the same time, the designs had to be detailed enough so as to seem at least somewhat realistic, even at such a small size. To solve this problem, the settlers' proportions were exaggerated, and their weapons and tools designed so as to be proportionally too big, as correctly sized implements would be far too small to be seen. For the process of animating the settlers, character animator/co-writer Thorsten Wallner explains, \\"we place a skeleton behind each settler, which controls the movement sequences. Each skeleton dictates the standard movements, such as bending, running or standing. Additional animations can then be added to individual characters. With this technology, we do not need to animate every settler anew, but only add additional animations.\\" =Promotion and delay= In July 2000, Blue Byte advertised for 5,000 participants for an online closed beta. However, the beta was postponed in early August, due to \\"technical issues related to the lobby software causing disruption to Battle Isle: The Andosia War.\\" In late August, Blue Byte revealed it would be at least mid- September before the beta began. In October, Blue Byte released \\"Smack a Thief\\", a minigame designed to promote the main game. A variation on Whac-A- Mole, in \\"Smack a Thief\\", the player must click on Viking thieves before they can raid the Roman stores and escape. Available as a free download from Blue Byte's website, the game allowed players to upload their high scores to a global high score table. In early November, the online beta was cancelled, with Blue Byte stating, \\"we have decided to take this step to concentrate on completing the game. Conducting a large, public beta test requires a lot of additional resources, which we now want to invest more specifically in development. Quality assurance will instead be ensured by our own internal testing department.\\" In an interview with Planet of Games, Br√§ndle further explained, \\"we do not have the resources to filter and sort all of the anticipated feedback from a beta test. We are currently concentrating exclusively on completion of the product.\\" The following week, Blue Byte announced the slated December release had been pushed back to January 2001, with Thomas Hertzler (Blue Byte CEO and the series producer) explaining, \\"we know that many gamers were particularly looking forward to The Settlers IV this year and, of course, we understand if Settlerss fans are disappointed. In the end, however, we made our decision with the players in mind. The Settlers IV will not be on shelves before Christmas, but fans will receive a game that corresponds to Blue Byte's high quality standard.\\" =Release and Ubisoft takeover= In January, the German release date was pushed back to February 15. On February 6, Ubi Soft announced their acquisition of Blue Byte, revealing their plans to publish the game internationally, with president and CEO, Yves Guillemot, stating, On February 15, the game was released in Germany as planned. However, it suffered from numerous bugs, leading to a negative reaction from fans, and criticism of both the game and Blue Byte in the German gaming press. Although Blue Byte issued a patch the same day the game was released, it introduced additional problems, leading to further negative press. A second patch was released four days later to correct the problems introduced by the first patch. According to German magazine PC Games, 76% of players experienced technical difficulties with the release version of the game. Co-designer Thorsten Mutschall later admitted it had not been ready for release in February and should have been held back for additional playtesting and programming. On March 19, Ubi Soft announced the game would be released throughout Europe at the end of the month, explaining \\"the reasons behind the unfortunate delay of the product were essentially quality assurance issues.\\" Screenshot of The Settlers HD on Symbian, showing how the game's controls and HUD have been ported to a touchscreen device; the mail icon on the top left is for notifications, the building icon on the bottom left brings up the building menu (which is further subdivided into different menus for different types of building), the greyed out image on the bottom right is to select any speciality settlers, and the star icon on the top right is to display the mini-map. =Portable versions= In November 2009, working in conjunction with Blue Byte, under license from Ubisoft, Gameloft ported the game to iOS, released under the title The Settlers. In April 2010, the game was ported to webOS, specifically optimised for use with the Palm Pre. In September, Gameloft released HD versions for iPad and bada (optimised for the Wave S8500). The Settlers HD was later released for Symbian in January 2011, and for Android in May. Although the handheld versions of the game feature updated graphics, the gameplay and game mechanics are identical to the original, with the storyline including the full twenty-one single-player missions from the original release (three Roman missions, three Viking missions, three Mayan missions, and a twelve mission Dark Tribe campaign). The main change to the game involves the HUD, which was redesigned so as to accommodate touchscreen controls. For example, rather than the building menu always present onscreen, it is accessed by pressing an icon which opens the \\"Build Menu\\". From within this menu, the player then has access to various submenus, such as \\"Basic Buildings\\", \\"Food Buildings\\" and \\"Military Buildings.\\" Similarly, to access the menu to control specialist settlers, the player touches another icon, which is only available if the player has any such settlers available. Pressing down on any icon for two seconds brings up a brief help screen for that icon, and pausing the game allows the player to access a full help menu, replacing the \\"Extended tool tips\\" which appeared on-screen in the original. Reception The Settlers IV received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, with an aggregate score of 74 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on five reviews, and 71% on GameRankings, based on seventeen reviews. The iOS version was received more positively, with an aggregate score of 79% on GameRankings, based on six reviews. PC Players Damian Knaus scored the original game 85 out of 100, giving it a \\"Gold Player\\" award. Although he was impressed with the Dark Tribe, he criticised the integration of gardeners into the gameplay, calling them an \\"unnecessary extravagance.\\" He was also critical of the lack of any \\"real innovations\\" and the absence of female settlers. However, despite these reservations, he felt the game was the best Settlers title thus far, and was especially impressed with the graphics. PC Games R√ºdiger Steidle scored it 77%, the lowest score the magazine had ever given to a Settlers title. The issue in which the review appeared had both an editorial justifying the score, and a text box within the review, titled \\"Why only 77%\\", in which the magazine stated, In his review, Steidle criticised the game's similarity to Settlers III, writing, \\"Blue Byte has not altered the concept at all.\\" Although he praised the graphics, the tutorials, and the variety of mission objectives, he was critical of the bugs, writing, \\"in typical Blue Byte fashion, the game has appeared in time for the first patch.\\" He concluded, \\"anyone who is, like me, a fan of the series, will be disappointed.\\" PC Gamers Jim Preston scored it 72%. Although he praised the economic system on which the game is built, he criticised the lack of variety within it, writing, \\"you're forced to create the entire supporting infrastructure for your settlement the same way every time.\\" He also referred to the gameplay as \\"complication masquerading as depth.\\" IGNs Dan Adams scored it 7 out of 10, comparing it unfavourably to Zeus: Master of Olympus. His biggest criticism concerned the lack of differentiation from Settlers III, writing \\"aside from some improved graphics and small additions, it's hard to tell this is really a new game.\\" He was also critical of the AI, pathfinding, and repetitive missions, and he felt the designers had failed to steer the gameplay away from an over-reliance on combat. Although he praised the graphics, animations, and the game's \\"great personality,\\" he concluded, \\"Blue Byte hasn't managed to find [any] new ideas that might keep the series from becoming the serious pool of stagnant gaming that it is quickly becoming.\\" GameSpys Bernard Dy scored it 67 out of 100, comparing it unfavourably to Age of Empires II. Like Adams, he felt it was too similar to Settlers III, and although he praised the \\"appealing\\" graphics and \\"fascinating\\" animations, he felt Blue Byte had failed to return the gameplay to an economic focus, writing \\"nearly every scenario is a race to build a military.\\" He also criticised the AI, lack of combat strategy, and mission variety. He did, however, praise Free Settle and multiplayer modes. He concluded, \\"Settlers: Fourth Edition has charming moments, but has been long surpassed by games with better character and superior combat.\\" GameSpots Ron Dulin scored it 6.4 out of 10, finding similar problems to Adams and Dy, and comparing it unfavourably to Impressions Games' City Building series. Finding it too similar to Settlers III, he felt Blue Byte had failed to move away from a reliance on combat. He also criticised the mission variety and the lack of combat strategy, writing, \\"it's never more complex than moving all of your units slowly through enemy territory, hoping you'll have some left after your opponent doesn't.\\" Although he praised the basic supply and demand-based gameplay and the graphics, he concluded, \\"The Settlers: Fourth Edition is really just the same old game with the same old problems.\\" Computer Gaming Worlds Mark Asher scored it 3 out of 5, criticising \\"scenarios that differ in only minor ways,\\" and arguing the best part of the game was Free Settler mode. Although he praised the graphics, and called the game a \\"pleasant enough experience,\\" he noted it offered no major differences from previous Settlers titles, and would interest only the existing fanbase, who, he opined, may be getting bored of the same formula. =Sales= The game was a commercial success, and 2001's highest selling German-developed game. In February 2002, it was awarded the \\"Platinum Award\\" by the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland e.V. (VUD); an award given to titles costing DM55 or more, which sell over 200,000 units nationally within the first twelve months of their release. By August 2002, the game had sold over 300,000 units in Germany. =Portable= AppSpys Andrew Nesvadba scored the iOS version 5 out of 5, praising the graphics and touchscreen controls, and writing, \\"The Settlers is everything great about strategy games. It's easy enough to jump in and muck around while progressing, but ultimately there's a complex and amazingly detailed set of interactions for players to learn.\\" Arron Hirst of 148Apps scored it 4 out of 5. Although he was critical of the lack of free play and multiplayer modes, he praised the controls and the replication of the original game mechanics, concluding, \\"the game is both immersive and addicting.\\" TouchArcade also scored it 4 out of 5, criticising the lack of free play, but praising the graphics and sound effects, and calling the game \\"a solid experience.\\" Pocket Gamers Tracy Erickson scored it 8 out of 10, giving it a \\"Silver Award\\", and calling it \\"surprisingly good\\" and \\"largely positive.\\" Although he was critical of the lack of free play and multiplayer modes, and felt the playing area was oftentimes too cluttered with icons and menus, he concluded by praising the \\"deep economic strategy gameplay.\\" Pocket Gamers Wayne Turton scored the bada version of The Settlers HD 7 out of 10, giving it a \\"Bronze Award\\" and praising the tutorials, controls, and graphics. However, he was critical of the absence of non-campaign missions and multiplayer mode, and of the combat system, writing victory \\"usually comes down to which side can field the most units.\\" He concluded, \\"there's a magical quality to The Settlers HD that draws you in, and a depth that will keep you playing.\\" All About Symbians Ewan Spence scored the Symbian version 76%. Although critical of the AI, and feeling that the screen becomes too cluttered, especially during combat, he concluded, \\"it hits all the required marks in a game like this.\\" Pocket Gamers Brendan Caldwell scored the Android version 8 out of 10, giving it a \\"Silver Award\\", and calling it \\"an almost resounding victory.\\" Although critical of the tutorials, which he felt didn't adequately explain the intricacies of the game, and the controls, which he argued \\"don't quite have the accuracy or speed to truly emulate the traditional mouse and keyboard setup,\\" he concluded, \\"with a depth not often enjoyed by Android titles, Settlers HD can be an enthralling game.\\" Expansions =Mission CD= The game's first expansion was The Settlers IV Mission CD, released in Germany in August 2001, and featuring three five-mission single-player campaigns, three \\"Settlement\\" missions (focusing on building up the player's settlement and achieving economic goals, as opposed to military conquest), three \\"Conflict\\" missions (focusing on combat), sixteen new maps for single-player mode, and eighteen new maps for multiplayer mode. In terms of gameplay, the Mission CD features improved AI, more varied mission objectives, more sophisticated scripting within missions, and higher difficulty in single-player games. The expansion also features a random map generator, and map editor, and numerous bug fixes and stabilisations. =The Trojans and the Elixir of Power= Blue Byte released a second expansion, The Settlers IV: The Trojans and the Elixir of Power, in December, featuring thirteen new maps for single-player mode, thirteen new maps for multiplayer mode, three new four-mission single-player campaigns for each of the original three races, four Settlement missions, and a new twelve-mission campaign, in which the player controls a new race, the Trojans. The expansion also features improved graphics, adjustable difficulty, and the random map generator and map editor included with the Mission CD. In terms of gameplay, the importance of eyecatchers has been modified. Whereas in the original game, the player could increase their offensive strength beyond 100% by building enough eyectachers, or by building large numbers of a single eyectacher, in The Trojans and the Elixir of Power the maximum offensive strength achievable is 100%, which can only be reached if the player builds at least one of every eyecatcher. =Gold Edition= Released in March 2002, The Settlers IV: Gold Edition contains the original game, the Mission CD and The Trojans and the Elixir of Power. It also features fan-made maps for multiplayer mode, the \\"Smack a Thief\\" minigame, a new minigame (\\"The Dark Side\\"), Microsoft Windows wallpapers, and Settlers-themed skins for Winamp and ICQ. In 2013, the Gold Edition was released on GOG.com. =Die Neue Welt and Community Pack= Blue Byte later released two German-language expansions. In November 2002, they released Die Siedler IV: Die Neue Welt (). Set shortly after the Vikings discover America, the game begins with the Mayans organising a feast for the Vikings, before travelling to Europe with the aim of taking possession of the Wonders of the World, beginning with the Colossus of Rhodes. The Vikings, meanwhile, discover a map amongst the Mayans' possessions leading to a mythological island inhabited only by women, which they promptly set out to find. The Trojans, having been expelled from Troy by the Romans, are searching for a new homeland, and so head west. At the same time, the Romans are attempting to reconquer the world, beginning with the newly discovered continent. The expansion features four five-mission single-player campaigns (one for each of the three original races, and one for the Trojans), each with multiple objectives, many of which are optional, and most of which are economic-based rather than military-based. There are also two new single- player maps, and three new multiplayer maps, all with enhanced graphics and textures. In November 2003, they released Die Siedler IV: Community Pack. The expansion features four fan-created single-player campaigns based on real historical conflicts; the Roman attack on Carthage during the Third Punic War, the Viking invasion of England, the Huaxtec resistance against Spanish Conquistadors, and the battle for Troad during the Wars of the Diadochi. =History Edition= In November 2018, Ubisoft re-released the game as both a standalone History Edition and as part of The Settlers: History Collection. Optimised for Windows 10, the re-release contains the original game, and the Mission CD, The Trojans and the Elixir of Power, Die Neue Welt, and Community Pack expansions, and features autosave, 4K monitor support, dual monitor support, adjustable resolutions and texture quality, vsync, and online multiplayer. Available only on Uplay, the History Collection also includes re- releases of The Settlers, The Settlers II, The Settlers III, The Settlers: Heritage of Kings, The Settlers: Rise of an Empire, and The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom.

Born in Salins in 1650, Ma√Ætre married C√©cile de Winssinkercke, who had been born in Louvain on 7 September 1670. Ma√Ætre was the seigneur of Laer, near Tirlemont. Between 1696 and 1701 he volunteered his service as a cavalry colonel with the Dutch Republic. In 1701 he offered his services to Philip V of Spain, and became general of cavalry serving in Flanders. He distinguished himself in the War of Spanish Succession, especially during the Battle of Ekeren on 30 June 1703, fighting alongside the duc de Villeroy, at the head of the cavalry and the dragoons. On 23 July 1704 Philip V granted Ma√Ætre the dignity of Marquis de Bay and Captain-General of Extremadura. He was at this time described as lieutenant general of Philip's armies and first lieutenant of his bodyguards. On the night of 14‚Äì15 December 1706 he captured Alcantara with 800 infantry and 200 cavalry. In June 1707 he seized a fort defending the bridge at Olivenza, then demolished the bridge. On 4 October he stormed Ciudad Rodrigo, capturing the city after three-quarters of an hour. For this victory he was created a Knight of the Golden Fleece by the King of Spain, a title gazetted in France on 10 December 1707, and was named Viceroy of Extremadura. Ma√Ætre led the Spanish armies at the Battle of La Gudina on 7 May 1709, defeating a combined Anglo-Portuguese force, and commanded at the Battle of Saragossa on 20 August 1710.

There has been significant controversy in the academic community about the heritability of IQ since research on the issue began in the late nineteenth century. Intelligence in the normal range is a polygenic trait, meaning that it is influenced by more than one gene,Alice Marcus. 2010. Human Genetics: An Overview. Alpha Science section 14.5 and in the case of intelligence at least 500 genes. Further, explaining the similarity in IQ of closely related persons requires careful study because environmental factors may be correlated with genetic factors. Twin studies of adult individuals have found a heritability of IQ between 57% and 73% with the most recent studies showing heritability for IQ as high as 80%. IQ goes from being weakly correlated with genetics, for children, to being strongly correlated with genetics for late teens and adults. The heritability of IQ increases with age and reaches an asymptote at 18‚Äì20 years of age and continues at that level well into adulthood. This phenomenon is known as the Wilson Effect. However, poor prenatal environment, malnutrition and disease are known to have lifelong deleterious effects. Although IQ differences between individuals have been shown to have a large hereditary component, it does not follow that mean group-level disparities (between-group differences) in IQ necessarily have a genetic basis. The current scientific consensus is that there is no evidence for a genetic component behind IQ differences between racial groups.  Heritability and caveats  \\"Heritability\\" is defined as the proportion of variance in a trait which is attributable to genetic variation within a defined population in a specific environment. Heritability takes a value ranging from 0 to 1; a heritability of 1 indicates that all variation in the trait in question is genetic in origin and a heritability of 0 indicates that none of the variation is genetic. The determination of many traits can be considered primarily genetic under similar environmental backgrounds. For example, a 2006 study found that adult height has a heritability estimated at 0.80 when looking only at the height variation within families where the environment should be very similar. Other traits have lower heritabilities, which indicate a relatively larger environmental influence. For example, a twin study on the heritability of depression in men calculated it as 0.29, while it was 0.42 for women in the same study. = Caveats = There are a number of points to consider when interpreting heritability: * Heritability measures the proportion of variation in a trait that can be attributed to genes, and not the proportion of a trait caused by genes. Thus, if the environment relevant to a given trait changes in a way that affects all members of the population equally, the mean value of the trait will change without any change in its heritability (because the variation or differences among individuals in the population will stay the same). This has evidently happened for height: the heritability of stature is high, but average heights continue to increase. Thus, even in developed nations, a high heritability of a trait does not necessarily mean that average group differences are due to genes. Some have gone further, and used height as an example in order to argue that \\"even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability.\\" * A common error is to assume that a heritability figure is necessarily unchangeable. The value of heritability can change if the impact of environment (or of genes) in the population is substantially altered. If the environmental variation encountered by different individuals increases, then the heritability figure would decrease. On the other hand, if everyone had the same environment, then heritability would be 100%. The population in developing nations often has more diverse environments than in developed nations. This would mean that heritability figures would be lower in developing nations. Another example is phenylketonuria which previously caused mental retardation for everyone who had this genetic disorder and thus had a heritability of 100%. Today, this can be prevented by following a modified diet, resulting in a lowered heritability. * A high heritability of a trait does not mean that environmental effects such as learning are not involved. Vocabulary size, for example, is very substantially heritable (and highly correlated with general intelligence) although every word in an individual's vocabulary is learned. In a society in which plenty of words are available in everyone's environment, especially for individuals who are motivated to seek them out, the number of words that individuals actually learn depends to a considerable extent on their genetic predispositions and thus heritability is high. * Since heritability increases during childhood and adolescence, and even increases greatly between 16‚Äì20 years of age and adulthood, one should be cautious drawing conclusions regarding the role of genetics and environment from studies where the participants are not followed until they are adults. Furthermore, there may be differences regarding the effects on the g-factor and on non-g factors, with g possibly being harder to affect and environmental interventions disproportionately affecting non-g factors. * Polygenic traits often appear less heritable at the extremes. A heritable trait is definitionally more likely to appear in the offspring of two parents high in that trait than in the offspring of two randomly selected parents. However, the more extreme the expression of the trait in the parents, the less likely the child is to display the same extreme as the parents. At the same time, the more extreme the expression of the trait in the parents, the more likely the child is to express the trait at all. For example, the child of two extremely tall parents is likely to be taller than the average person (displaying the trait), but unlikely to be taller than the two parents (displaying the trait at the same extreme). See also regression toward the mean.  Estimates  Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States. It may seem reasonable to expect that genetic influences on traits like IQ should become less important as one gains experiences with age. However, that the opposite occurs is well documented. Heritability measures in infancy are as low as 0.2, around 0.4 in middle childhood, and as high as 0.8 in adulthood. One proposed explanation is that people with different genes tend to seek out different environments that reinforce the effects of those genes. The brain undergoes morphological changes in development which suggests that age-related physical changes could also contribute to this effect. A 1994 article in Behavior Genetics based on a study of Swedish monozygotic and dizygotic twins found the heritability of the sample to be as high as 0.80 in general cognitive ability; however, it also varies by trait, with 0.60 for verbal tests, 0.50 for spatial and speed-of- processing tests, and 0.40 for memory tests. In contrast, studies of other populations estimate an average heritability of 0.50 for general cognitive ability. In 2006, The New York Times Magazine listed about three quarters as a figure held by the majority of studies. = Shared family environment = There are some family effects on the IQ of children, accounting for up to a quarter of the variance. However, adoption studies show that by adulthood adoptive siblings aren't more similar in IQ than strangers, while adult full siblings show an IQ correlation of 0.24. However, some studies of twins reared apart (e.g. Bouchard, 1990) find a significant shared environmental influence, of at least 10% going into late adulthood. Judith Rich Harris suggests that this might be due to biasing assumptions in the methodology of the classical twin and adoption studies. There are aspects of environments that family members have in common (for example, characteristics of the home). This shared family environment accounts for 0.25-0.35 of the variation in IQ in childhood. By late adolescence it is quite low (zero in some studies). There is a similar effect for several other psychological traits. These studies have not looked into the effects of extreme environments such as in abusive families. The American Psychological Association's report \\"Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns\\" (1996) states that there is no doubt that normal child development requires a certain minimum level of responsible care. Severely deprived, neglectful, or abusive environments must have negative effects on a great many aspects of development, including intellectual aspects. Beyond that minimum, however, the role of family experience is in serious dispute. There is no doubt that such variables as resources of the home and parents' use of language are correlated with children's IQ scores, but such correlations may be mediated by genetic as well as (or instead of) environmental factors. But how much of that variance in IQ results from differences between families, as contrasted with the varying experiences of different children in the same family? Recent twin and adoption studies suggest that while the effect of the shared family environment is substantial in early childhood, it becomes quite small by late adolescence. These findings suggest that differences in the life styles of families whatever their importance may be for many aspects of children's lives make little long-term difference for the skills measured by intelligence tests. = Non-shared family environment and environment outside the family = Although parents treat their children differently, such differential treatment explains only a small amount of non-shared environmental influence. One suggestion is that children react differently to the same environment due to different genes. More likely influences may be the impact of peers and other experiences outside the family. For example, siblings grown up in the same household may have different friends and teachers and even contract different illnesses. This factor may be one of the reasons why IQ score correlations between siblings decreases as they get older. = Malnutrition and diseases = Certain single-gene metabolic disorders can severely affect intelligence. Phenylketonuria is an example, with publications demonstrating the capacity of phenylketonuria to produce a reduction of 10 IQ points on average. Meta-analyses have found that environmental factors, such as iodine deficiency, can result in large reductions in average IQ; iodine deficiency has been shown to produce a reduction of 12.5 IQ points on average. = Heritability and socioeconomic status = The APA report \\"Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns\\" (1996) also stated that: > \\"We should note, however, that low-income and non-white families are poorly > represented in existing adoption studies as well as in most twin samples. > Thus it is not yet clear whether these studies apply to the population as a > whole. It remains possible that, across the full range of income and > ethnicity, between-family differences have more lasting consequences for > psychometric intelligence.\\" A study (1999) by Capron and Duyme of French children adopted between the ages of four and six examined the influence of socioeconomic status (SES). The children's IQs initially averaged 77, putting them near retardation. Most were abused or neglected as infants, then shunted from one foster home or institution to the next. Nine years later after adoption, when they were on average 14 years old, they retook the IQ tests, and all of them did better. The amount they improved was directly related to the adopting family's socioeconomic status. \\"Children adopted by farmers and laborers had average IQ scores of 85.5; those placed with middle-class families had average scores of 92. The average IQ scores of youngsters placed in well-to-do homes climbed more than 20 points, to 98.\\" Stoolmiller (1999) argued that the range of environments in previous adoption studies was restricted. Adopting families tend to be more similar on, for example, socio-economic status than the general population, which suggests a possible underestimation of the role of the shared family environment in previous studies. Corrections for range restriction to adoption studies indicated that socio-economic status could account for as much as 50% of the variance in IQ. On the other hand, the effect of this was examined by Matt McGue and colleagues (2007), who wrote that \\"restriction in range in parent disinhibitory psychopathology and family socio-economic status had no effect on adoptive-sibling correlations [in] IQ\\" Turkheimer and colleagues (2003) argued that the proportions of IQ variance attributable to genes and environment vary with socioeconomic status. They found that in a study on seven-year-old twins, in impoverished families, 60% of the variance in early childhood IQ was accounted for by the shared family environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero; in affluent families, the result is almost exactly the reverse. In contrast to Turkheimer (2003), a study by Nagoshi and Johnson (2005) concluded that the heritability of IQ did not vary as a function of parental socioeconomic status in the 949 families of Caucasian and 400 families of Japanese ancestry who took part in the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition. Asbury and colleagues (2005) studied the effect of environmental risk factors on verbal and non-verbal ability in a nationally representative sample of 4-year-old British twins. There was not any statistically significant interaction for non-verbal ability, but the heritability of verbal ability was found to be higher in low-SES and high-risk environments. Harden, Turkheimer, and Loehlin (2007) investigated adolescents, most 17 years old, and found that, among higher income families, genetic influences accounted for approximately 55% of the variance in cognitive aptitude and shared environmental influences about 35%. Among lower income families, the proportions were in the reverse direction, 39% genetic and 45% shared environment.\\" In the course of a substantial review, Rushton and Jensen (2010) criticized the study of Capron and Duyme, arguing their choice of IQ test and selection of child and adolescent subjects were a poor choice because this gives a relatively less hereditable measure. The argument here rests on a strong form of Spearman's hypothesis, that the hereditability of different kinds of IQ test can vary according to how closely they correlate to the general intelligence factor (g); both the empirical data and statistical methodology bearing on this question are matters of active controversy.Ashton, M. C., & Lee, K. (2005). Problems with the method of correlated vectors. Intelligence, 33(4), 431‚Äì444.Flynn, J. R. (2010). The spectacles through which I see the race and IQ debate. Intelligence, 38(4), 363‚Äì366. A 2011 study by Tucker-Drob and colleagues reported that at age 2, genes accounted for approximately 50% of the variation in mental ability for children being raised in high socioeconomic status families, but genes accounted for negligible variation in mental ability for children being raised in low socioeconomic status families. This gene-environment interaction was not apparent at age 10 months, suggesting that the effect emerges over the course of early development. A 2012 study based on a representative sample of twins from the United Kingdom, with longitudinal data on IQ from age two to age fourteen, did not find evidence for lower heritability in low-SES families. However, the study indicated that the effects of shared family environment on IQ were generally greater in low-SES families than in high-SES families, resulting in greater variance in IQ in low-SES families. The authors noted that previous research had produced inconsistent results on whether or not SES moderates the heritability of IQ. They suggested three explanations for the inconsistency. First, some studies may have lacked statistical power to detect interactions. Second, the age range investigated has varied between studies. Third, the effect of SES may vary in different demographics and different countries. A 2017 King's College London study suggests that genes account for nearly 50 per cent of the differences between whether children are socially mobile or not. = Maternal (fetal) environment = A meta-analysis by Devlin and colleagues (1997) of 212 previous studies evaluated an alternative model for environmental influence and found that it fits the data better than the 'family-environments' model commonly used. The shared maternal (fetal) environment effects, often assumed to be negligible, account for 20% of covariance between twins and 5% between siblings, and the effects of genes are correspondingly reduced, with two measures of heritability being less than 50%. They argue that the shared maternal environment may explain the striking correlation between the IQs of twins, especially those of adult twins that were reared apart. IQ heritability increases during early childhood, but whether it stabilizes thereafter remains unclear. These results have two implications: a new model may be required regarding the influence of genes and environment on cognitive function; and interventions aimed at improving the prenatal environment could lead to a significant boost in the population's IQ. Bouchard and McGue reviewed the literature in 2003, arguing that Devlin's conclusions about the magnitude of heritability is not substantially different from previous reports and that their conclusions regarding prenatal effects stands in contradiction to many previous reports. They write that: > Chipuer et al. and Loehlin conclude that the postnatal rather than the > prenatal environment is most important. The Devlin et al. (1997a) conclusion > that the prenatal environment contributes to twin IQ similarity is > especially remarkable given the existence of an extensive empirical > literature on prenatal effects. Price (1950), in a comprehensive review > published over 50 years ago, argued that almost all MZ twin prenatal effects > produced differences rather than similarities.

Research > subsequent to the 1978 review largely reinforces Price‚Äôs hypothesis (Bryan, > 1993; Macdonald et al., 1993; Hall and Lopez-Rangel, 1996; see also Martin > et al., 1997, box 2; Machin, 1996). = Dickens and Flynn model = Dickens and Flynn (2001) argued that the \\"heritability\\" figure includes both a direct effect of the genotype on IQ and also indirect effects where the genotype changes the environment, in turn affecting IQ. That is, those with a higher IQ tend to seek out stimulating environments that further increase IQ. The direct effect can initially have been very small but feedback loops can create large differences in IQ. In their model an environmental stimulus can have a very large effect on IQ, even in adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues. This model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition in early childhood, that may cause permanent effects. The Flynn effect is the increase in average intelligence test scores by about 0.3% annually, resulting in the average person today scoring 15 points higher in IQ compared to the generation 50 years ago. This effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that programs aiming to increase IQ would be most likely to produce long-term IQ gains if they taught children how to replicate outside the program the kinds of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains while they are in the program and motivate them to persist in that replication long after they have left the program. Most of the improvements have allowed for better abstract reasoning, spatial relations, and comprehension. Some scientists have suggested that such enhancements are due to better nutrition, better parenting and schooling, as well as exclusion of the least intelligent people from reproduction. However, Flynn and a group of other scientists share the viewpoint that modern life implies solving many abstract problems which leads to a rise in their IQ scores. = Influence of genes on IQ stability = Recent research has illuminated genetic factors underlying IQ stability and change. Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that the genes involved in intelligence remain fairly stable over time. Specifically, in terms of IQ stability, \\"genetic factors mediated phenotypic stability throughout this entire period [age 0 to 16], whereas most age-to-age instability appeared to be due to non-shared environmental influences\\". These findings have been replicated extensively and observed in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands. Additionally, researchers have shown that naturalistic changes in IQ occur in individuals at variable times. = Influence of parents genes that are not inherited = Kong reports that, \\"Nurture has a genetic component, i.e. alleles in the parents affect the parents' phenotypes and through that influence the outcomes of the child.\\" These results were obtained through a meta-analysis of educational attainment and polygenic scores of non-transmitted alleles. Although the study deals with educational attainment and not IQ, these two are strongly linked.  Spatial ability component of IQ  Spatial ability has been shown to be unifactorial (a single score accounts well for all spatial abilities), and is 69% heritable in a sample of 1,367 twins from the ages 19 through 21. Further only 8% of spatial ability can be accounted for by a shared environmental factors like school and family. Of the genetically determined portion of spatial ability, 24% is shared with verbal ability (general intelligence) and 43% was specific to spatial ability alone.  Molecular genetic investigations  A 2009 review article identified over 50 genetic polymorphisms that have been reported to be associated with cognitive ability in various studies, but noted that the discovery of small effect sizes and lack of replication have characterized this research so far. Another study attempted to replicate 12 reported associations between specific genetic variants and general cognitive ability in three large datasets, but found that only one of the genotypes was significantly associated with general intelligence in one of the samples, a result expected by chance alone. The authors concluded that most reported genetic associations with general intelligence are probably false positives brought about by inadequate sample sizes, but see.Weiss, Volkmar: Das IQ-Gen - verleugnet seit 2015: Eine bahnbrechende Entdeckung und ihre Feinde. Ares Verlag, Graz 2017, Arguing that common genetic variants explain much of the variation in general intelligence, they suggested that the effects of individual variants are so small that very large samples are required to reliably detect them. Genetic diversity within individuals is heavily correlated with IQ. A novel molecular genetic method for estimating heritability calculates the overall genetic similarity (as indexed by the cumulative effects of all genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms) between all pairs of individuals in a sample of unrelated individuals and then correlates this genetic similarity with phenotypic similarity across all the pairs. A study using this method estimated that the lower bounds for the narrow-sense heritability of crystallized and fluid intelligence are 40% and 51%, respectively. A replication study in an independent sample confirmed these results, reporting a heritability estimate of 47%. These findings are compatible with the view that a large number of genes, each with only a small effect, contribute to differences in intelligence.  Correlations between IQ and degree of genetic relatedness  The relative influence of genetics and environment for a trait can be calculated by measuring how strongly traits covary in people of a given genetic (unrelated, siblings, fraternal twins, or identical twins) and environmental (reared in the same family or not) relationship. One method is to consider identical twins reared apart, with any similarities that exist between such twin pairs attributed to genotype. In terms of correlation statistics, this means that theoretically the correlation of tests scores between monozygotic twins would be 1.00 if genetics alone accounted for variation in IQ scores; likewise, siblings and dizygotic twins share on average half alleles and the correlation of their scores would be 0.50 if IQ were affected by genes alone (or greater if there is a positive correlation between the IQs of spouses in the parental generation). Practically, however, the upper bound of these correlations are given by the reliability of the test, which is 0.90 to 0.95 for typical IQ testsJensen, Arthur (1998). The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability. Westport, Connecticut: Praeger Publishers If there is biological inheritance of IQ, then the relatives of a person with a high IQ should exhibit a comparably high IQ with a much higher probability than the general population. In 1982, Bouchard and McGue reviewed such correlations reported in 111 original studies in the United States. The mean correlation of IQ scores between monozygotic twins was 0.86, between siblings 0.47, between half-siblings 0.31, and between cousins 0.15. The 2006 edition of Assessing adolescent and adult intelligence by Alan S. Kaufman and Elizabeth O. Lichtenberger reports correlations of 0.86 for identical twins raised together compared to 0.76 for those raised apart and 0.47 for siblings. These number are not necessarily static. When comparing pre-1963 to late 1970s data, researches DeFries and Plomin found that the IQ correlation between parent and child living together fell significantly, from 0.50 to 0.35. The opposite occurred for fraternal twins. Every one of these studies presented next contains estimates of only two of the three factors which are relevant. The three factors are G, E, and GxE. Since there is no possibility of studying equal environments in a manner comparable to using identical twins for equal genetics, the GxE factor can not be isolated. Thus the estimates are actually of G+GxE and E. Although this may seem like nonsense, it is justified by the unstated assumption that GxE=0. It is also the case that the values shown below are r correlations and not r(squared), proportions of variance. Numbers less than one are smaller when squared. The next to last number in the list below refers to less than 5% shared variance between a parent and child living apart.

The Flynn effect is one example where there is a large difference between groups (past and present) with little or no genetic difference. An analogy, attributed to Richard Lewontin, illustrates this point: > Suppose two handfuls are taken from a sack containing a genetically diverse > variety of corn, and each grown under carefully controlled and standardized > conditions, except that one batch is lacking in certain nutrients that are > supplied to the other. After several weeks, the plants are measured. There > is variability of growth within each batch, due to the genetic variability > of the corn. Given that the growing conditions are closely controlled, > nearly all the variation in the height of the plants within a batch will be > due to differences in their genes. Thus, within populations, heritabilities > will be very high. Nevertheless, the difference between the two groups is > due entirely to an environmental factor‚Äîdifferential nutrition. Lewontin > didn't go so far as to have the one set of pots painted white and the other > set black, but you get the idea. The point of the example, in any case, is > that the causes of between-group differences may in principle be quite > different from the causes of within-group variation. Psychologist Arthur Jensen has written that while this is technically correct, a high heritability among individuals suggests to him that genetics play a role in average group differences. However, in contrast to Jensen's view, geneticist and neuroscientist Kevin Mitchell explains why \\"systematic genetic differences in intelligence between large, ancient populations\\" are \\"inherently and deeply implausible\\": > Because most random mutations that affect intelligence will reduce it, > evolution will tend to select against them.

Plot  Scientists have developed a weapon, called the \\"Super H-bomb\\", which if detonated will wipe out the human race entirely. A \\"High Tribunal\\" in \\"The Great Court of Outer Space\\" is called upon to decide whether divine intervention should be allowed to stop the bomb's detonation. The devil (Vincent Price), who goes by the name of Mr. Scratch, prosecutes Mankind while the Spirit of Man (Ronald Colman) defends it. Scratch and the Spirit of Man are allowed to take the tribunal to any period of time to present evidence for Mankind's salvation or damnation. They take the tribunal from prehistory through Egyptian, Greco- Roman, Medieval, Renaissance, Enlightenment, and modern times, looking at historical figures. Ultimately the tribunal is asked to rule. The high judge, facing Mr. Scratch and the Spirit, with a large assemblage of peoples in their native costumes behind them, declares that the good and evil of Mankind is too finely balanced. A decision is suspended until they return. When they do come back they expect to see a resolution of humanity's age old struggle with itself.  Cast  * Ronald Colman ...

Adolf Hitler Production background The film was former publicist Irwin Allen's first attempt at directing live actors after his documentaries The Sea Around Us and The Animal World. In May 1955 Allen announced he would write, produce and direct a film based on the book. Warner Bros agreed to distribute. Jack Warner announced 42 nations would be represented. Allen said securing the rights was \\"very complicated\\". In March 1956 Allen said the film had been in preproduction for a year and that filming would start in June. The original intention was for only two actors to appear in the film, a man and a woman representing mankind through the ages. The movie would take over two years to shoot in 18 countries and Warner Bros invited several prominent theologians, historians and philosopher to sit on an advisory board for the production. This plan was soon jettisoned. Allen finished a script with Charles Bennett by August 1956. =Casting= Allen wanted an all-star cast to play various people in history. All-star casts had just proved very popular in Around the World in 80 Days. \\"Where we can't do justice to a time and place we won't just brush them off summarily,\\" said Allen. \\"We just won't use them. There have been 400 or more giants of history in all our fields. Our big problem has been to bring them down to about 50, asking about each: was what he or she did lasting - and how long did it last? Telling history on the screen can be like telling a bad joke twice. You first have to find a handle, a gimmick.\\" The first four names cast were Vincent Price, Cedric Hardwicke, Diana Lynn (as Joan of Arc) and Peter Lorre. Next were Ronald Colman, Yvonne de Carlo (as Cleopatra), and Charles Coburn, plus Hedy Lamarr who replaced Lynn as Joan of Arc. Groucho Marx and Cesar Romero joined. Virginia Mayo ended up replacing de Carlo. Screenwriter Charles Bennett recalled that Allen paid each of the stars US$2000, though Greer Garson turned down the role of Queen Elizabeth I.p. 17 Charles Bennett Interview in Words into Images: Screenwriters on the Studio System Univ. Press of Mississippi =Shooting= Filming started 12 November 1956. Like Allen's previous two films, it features vast amounts of stock footage, in this case, battles and action scenes culled from previous Warner Bros. costume films, coupled with cheaply shot close-ups of actors on much smaller sets. This was the last film picture to feature the three Marx Brothers (and their only film in Technicolor), although they are seen in separate scenes rather than acting together. This was also the last film of star Ronald Colman and character actor Franklin Pangborn, and the last American film of Hedy Lamarr. Reception The Story of Mankind was listed in the 1978 book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. Home media Warner Home Video released the film as part of its Warner Archive made-to-order DVD line on July 20, 2009 in the United States.

Kison won two World Series championships with the Pirates, both over the Baltimore Orioles, and is perhaps best remembered for throwing scoreless innings of relief to win Game 4 of the 1971 World Series. He batted and threw right-handed. Kison grew up in Pasco, Washington, and was drafted by the Pirates in the 14th round of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. He reached the major leagues in 1971 and relieved Luke Walker in the first inning of Game 4 of the World Series, throwing scoreless innings as he enabled the Pirates to come from behind to win the game, and ultimately the Series. Bothered by a sore shoulder the next two years, Kison adjusted his delivery in the 1973‚Äì74 offseason, becoming a full-time starter by the middle of 1974. In 1976, he set career highs in wins (14) and earned run average (ERA) (3.08). He had a disappointing 1977 season, partly because of hangnail problems, and in 1978, he was moved back to the bullpen to start the year. He regained his rotation spot halfway through the season, though, and proved an important member of the Pirates' rotation once again in 1979, winning the season's final game to send the Pirates to the playoffs. He struggled in his only start of the World Series but won his second World Series ring as the Pirates defeated the Orioles again. A free agent after the 1979 season, he signed a five-year contract with the Angels, but struggled with injuries his first couple of seasons and even tried to give the team back some of his contract money. In 1982, though, he helped the Angels reach the playoffs and won a game for them in the American League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. A herniated disk suffered in 1983 threatened to end his career, but he returned to the Angels late in 1984 and pitched one final season for the Boston Red Sox in 1985 before retiring. During a 15-year career, Kison compiled 115 wins with 88 losses, 1,073 strikeouts, and a 3.66 ERA. After his playing days were over, he served as a coach for the Kansas City Royals and the Baltimore Orioles, with whom he later served as a scout. He died June 2, 2018, at the age of 68. Early life Kison was born February 18, 1950, in Pasco, Washington. His father, Fred, worked as a building supplier, while his mother, Bertha, focused on homemaking. Kison started playing baseball in elementary school and was a pitcher and outfielder by the age of 12. At 14, an injury in a PONY League game caused him to start throwing sidearm. At Pasco High School, Kison threw three no-hitters, before getting selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 14th round of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. Career =Pittsburgh Pirates (1971‚Äì79)= Kison credited Harvey Haddix, a coach he had in the Gulf Coast League, as his most influential mentor. While pitching for the Waterbury Pirates of the Double-A Eastern League in 1970, Kison was picked by Sports Illustrated to be the subject of an article (released the following year) on life in the minor leagues. He had a 4‚Äì4 record at the time; he would not lose another game for Waterbury in 1970. An infected tendon in his pitching hand kept him from throwing in spring training in 1971, but he won 10 of 12 starts for the Charleston Charlies of the Triple-A International League. That strong start earned him a call-up to Pittsburgh for the first time in July, when Bob Moose had to serve a two-week stint in the United States Army Reserve. Kison made his debut on July 4 at Wrigley Field, allowing four runs over six innings in a no-decision against the Chicago Cubs. On July 23, he threw a complete game shutout against the San Diego Padres; Ed Spiezio remarked after the game that \\"Kison had the best stuff I've seen this season.\\" He ended his rookie season 6‚Äì5 with a 3.40 earned run average (ERA) in 18 games (13 starts) and was part of the Pirates' playoff roster as a relief pitcher. Though not used as a starter during the playoffs, Kison earned a couple of victories. During Game 4 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS) against the San Francisco Giants, Kison relieved Steve Blass after Blass had given up five runs in the first two innings. He threw scoreless innings of relief, then picked up the win as the Pirates prevailed 9‚Äì5, earning a spot in the World Series. \\"Chills ran down my back,\\" he said after the game. \\"If you don‚Äôt go out to the mound scared, you better get out of the game.‚Äù Kison then went on to be the winning pitcher in the first night game ever played in the Fall Classic. After Luke Walker gave up three runs to the Orioles in the first inning of Game 4, Kison entered, retired Davey Johnson on a groundout to end the inning, and threw six more scoreless innings as the Pirates came from behind to win the game 4‚Äì3, before ultimately winning the Series in seven games. Earl Weaver, manager of the Orioles, said of Kison's performance, \\"Kison turned the Series around.\\" After the 1971 season, Kison threw 92 innings for San Juan in the Puerto Rican Winter League. This led to a \\"tired arm,\\" which caused him to begin the 1972 season on the disabled list for the Pirates. After returning, he joined the bullpen for the Pirates, posting a 2.22 ERA through the end of May. In June, he replaced Bob Johnson in Pittsburgh's starting rotation. In 32 games (18 starts) for the Pirates, he had a 9‚Äì7 record and a 3.26 ERA. Again used as a reliever in the playoffs, he made two appearances in the 1972 NLCS, earning the win in Game 3 by pitching scoreless innings over the Cincinnati Reds. However, the Reds would win the series over the Pirates in five games. Shoulder troubles continued to plague Kison in 1973, and he started the season on the 21‚Äìday disabled list. Sent to Charleston to get used to pitching again, Kison was optimistic after throwing against the Pirates in a charity benefit game on July 3: \\"I definitely think I can come back this season.\\" In 20 starts at Charleston, he had an 8‚Äì6 record and a 4.66 ERA. Kison was called back up in September and, in his first start back on September 1, threw eight shutout innings in a no-decision, 1‚Äì0 Pirate victory over the Chicago Cubs. He would make seven starts for the Pirates to finish the year, going 3‚Äì0 with a 3.09 ERA. Three Rivers Stadium was where Kison's home games occurred during his nine years with the Pirates. Hoping to help his shoulder troubles out, the Pirates had Kison work with Don Osborn in the offseason. With Osborn's help, Kison adopted a three-quarter delivery instead of the sidearm approached, which gave him better control and relieved tension on his shoulder. He was back on the Pirates' roster in 1974, but in the bullpen; supposedly, Pirates' manager Danny Murtaugh wanted to protect Kison's arm from the early-season cold weather. He joined the Pirates' rotation on May 23, replacing Moose, who moved to the bullpen. After going 0‚Äì2 in three starts with a 6.28 ERA, though, he went back to the bullpen in favor of Larry Demery. He rejoined the rotation July 14, though, and stayed in it for most of the rest of the year. The 1974 season saw Kison set what would be a career-high in games (40, only 16 of which were starts). He had a 9‚Äì8 record and a 3.49 ERA, though blister problems during the year started affecting him in the sixth inning of his starts. Pittsburgh won the NL East, and Kison started Game 3 of the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching shutout innings in Pittsburgh's 7‚Äì0 victory. The win was Pittsburgh's lone victory of the series, as the Dodgers defeated them in four games. In 1975, Kison was the third starter for the Pirates. Through July 17, he had a 9‚Äì4 record and a 3.23 ERA. After that, he lost seven starts in a row before getting moved to the bullpen at the end of August. In one of those losses, on August 17 to Cincinnati, Kison allowed Pete Rose's 2,500th career hit. While in the bullpen, he snapped his losing streak on August 31 in a 9‚Äì6 victory over the Houston Astros. Used as a starter again in September, he won two more games, finishing the year with a 12‚Äì11 record and a 3.23 ERA in 33 games (29 starts). He had more walks (92) than strikeouts (89) on the season. The Pirates reached the playoffs again, but Kison made no starts for them, his lone appearance in the series coming in relief of Game 2 of the NLCS, as the Pirates were swept in three games by the Reds. The relief appearance snapped a streak of scoreless innings in the playoffs for Kison. Kison was the Pirates' number two starter in 1976, behind Doc Medich. After posting an ERA close to 6.00 in his first five starts, he changed his position on the mound. \\"I used to pitch from the third-base side of the rubber. My fastball was tailing away from left- handed hitters. The good ones were taking the pitch because it wasn‚Äôt a strike.‚Äù Through August 20, he had a 9‚Äì8 record. Then, on August 25, he threw a complete game shutout against the Padres, the first of six wins in a row for him. In 1976, Kison posted the best numbers of his career. He had the most wins (14, with 9 losses) and his lowest ERA (3.08). Once again, Kison was the Pirates' number two starter in 1977, this time behind Jerry Reuss. On July 8, Kison hit Mike Schmidt with a pitch during a game. Schmidt charged the mound, started a fight, and broke a finger, while Kison escaped without injury. He was bothered by a hangnail that year and tried numerous remedies to alleviate it, even resorting to fan mail suggestions such as packing it in salt and ice‚Äî\\"It gave me frostbite,\\" was how he described the effectiveness of that remedy. The nail trouble made it difficult for him to throw his fastball and slider, and he had to rely more on slower pitches, which limited his effectiveness. He had a losing record for the first time in his career in 1977, going 9‚Äì10 as his ERA ascended to 4.90, well below the league average. He summarized his season, \\"It was not an exceptionally good year.\\" However, Kison did have a career-high 122 strikeouts that season. The Pirates' additions of Bert Blyleven and Don Robinson relegated Kison to the bullpen for the first time since 1974. His first start of the season did not come until July 17, but it was not until the middle of August that he got back into the rotation regularly. From August 17 through the end of the season, he had a 4‚Äì3 record and a 2.50 ERA in seven starts. He finished the season with a 6‚Äì6 record and a 3.19 ERA in 28 games (11 starts). Though not expected to make the rotation in 1979, Kison began the year as a starter after Reuss was traded. He had a 1‚Äì1 record and a 3.94 ERA in his first six games, but in the middle of May, he lost his rotation spot to Ed Whitson. Moving to the bullpen, he had an 0.84 ERA in six games. Then, on June 3, Don Robinson had trouble warming up, and Kison had to make a spot start against the Padres; the start would be one of the best of his career. He pitched a one-hitter against the Padres, losing his no-hit bid when San Diego's Barry Evans doubled down the left field line with two out in the eighth. The Pirates won 7‚Äì0. After the game, Kison complained publicly about Charley Feeney and Dan Donovan's decision to give Evans a double; the incident led to the resignation of both Feeney and Donovan, and a new policy by Pittsburgh newspapers that their sportswriters would not serve as official scorers. He had another memorable game against San Diego on August 26, when he hit a grand slam against Bob Shirley in a 7‚Äì0 victory. From July 6 through the end of the year, he had a 9‚Äì3 record and a 2.93 ERA, finishing up with a 13‚Äì7 record and a 3.19 ERA. His most important start of the season came in the Pirates' last game of the year, a contest against the Cubs that had been scheduled because of an earlier tie against the New York Mets; the game was needed to determine whether the Pirates needed to play a tie-breaker against the Montreal Expos. Kison allowed one run over six innings, winning the game and the NL East pennant for the Pirates. \\"This is the most emotional situation I‚Äôve ever been in, because we had to work so hard to get there,‚Äù Kison said about returning to the playoffs. ‚ÄúOther years we ran away with it, but not this year. And it‚Äôs even more meaningful because the last two years we played our hearts out and came up empty.‚Äù Because Kison started the final game of the season, he did not make an appearance in the NLCS against the Reds, which the Pirates won in three games. He was the Pirates' choice for Game 1 of the World Series, which was postponed for a day because of snow at Memorial Stadium. Kison struggled in the game, giving up five runs in less than an inning in a 5‚Äì4 loss to the Orioles, his only loss in his postseason career. Developing forearm trouble during the game (perhaps because of the cold weather), Kison did not pitch again in the series, his rotation spot for Game 5 taken by Jim Rooker. However, he earned his second World Series ring as the Pirates defeated the Orioles in seven games. After the season, he became a free agent. =California Angels (1980‚Äì84) and Boston Red Sox (1985)= Multiple teams were interested in Kison over the offseason. Rich Gossage, closer and future Hall of Famer for the New York Yankees, tried to convince Kison to sign with his team, while the California Angels needed a replacement for Nolan Ryan, who had signed with the Houston Astros. Angels' general manager Buzzie Bavasi said that the team could replace Ryan with a couple of 8‚Äì7 pitchers. Both teams were reported to offer over $2 million, and Kison ultimately chose the Angels, signing a five-year contract with them. Kison opened 1980 as the number two starter in the Angels' rotation (behind Dave Frost). He had a second no-hit bid broken up in the ninth on April 23. With his team leading the Minnesota Twins 17‚Äì0 at Metropolitan Stadium, Kison had the no-hit bid broken up by a Ken Landreaux double with one out; the hit was the only one Kison would allow. A nerve problem in his pitching elbow limited him to one game after June 11, and he finished the year 3‚Äì6 with a 4.91 ERA in 13 games (all starts). The elbow injury required surgery; Kison was so embarrassed at being unable to fully fulfill his contract, he went to Bavasi and tried to give the money back. Initially, Kison complained of paralysis in his hand and a lack of feeling in three of his fingers after undergoing surgery on his ulnar nerve. Though the injury jeopardized his career, he managed to return to the Angels' bullpen in August 1981. In September, he was used for four starts. In 11 games (four starts), he had a 1‚Äì1 record and a 3.48 ERA. Entering 1982, Kison was the fifth starter in the Angels' rotation. He won his first four decisions of the year and had a 2.06 ERA through May 25, then had a 6.75 ERA over his next five starts. After Johnny Grubb of the Texas Rangers hit a line drive off his shin on June 22, the Angels moved Kison to the bullpen in favor of Dave Goltz. Used as a reliever for much of the rest of the season, he did not rejoin the rotation until September 14, but when he did, it was similar to the time he rejoined the Pirates' rotation in 1979. Kison threw nine shutout innings in a 7‚Äì0 victory over the Chicago White Sox, then held on to his rotation spot for the remainder of the year. He finished the season 10‚Äì5 with a 3.17 ERA in 33 games (16 starts) and made the playoffs for the sixth time as the Angels won the American League West. Tabbed to start in Game 2 of the ALCS against the Milwaukee Brewers, Kison allowed two runs over nine innings in a 4‚Äì2 Angel victory. He also started Game 5, giving up two runs (one earned) in five innings and leaving with the Angels ahead, but the Brewers came back and won 4‚Äì3 to win the Series in five games. In 1983, Kison was the Opening Day starter for the Angels, the first time in his 13 seasons he got a chance to start his team's first game of the year. His season started strong, as he won six of his first seven decisions. He missed a month from May 27 to June 27, then was moved to the bullpen in August after posting an 8.31 ERA in July. Shut down in September with injuries, he had surgery on September 26 to repair a herniated disk in his back; manager John McNamara feared his career was over. In 26 games (17 starts), he had an 11‚Äì5 record and a 4.05 ERA. Kison's career was not over; though he spent the beginning of 1984 on the disabled list, he returned to the team on June 13 as a reliever. In August, he rejoined the team's rotation after Geoff Zahn had surgery on bone chips in his knee. In 20 games (seven starts), he had a 4‚Äì5 record and a 5.37 ERA, the highest of his career. After the season, he became a free agent. Kison joined the Boston Red Sox in 1985, rejoining McNamara, who had managed him the previous two seasons with the Angels. He began the year in Boston's starting rotation but pulled a hamstring and went on the disabled list after his first start. He returned to the rotation in May, then was moved to the bullpen at the end of June after relinquishing six runs in three starts in a row. In 22 games (9 starts), he had a 5‚Äì3 record and a 4.11 ERA. McNamara praised the veteran Kison's influence on Boston's young pitchers. Diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff, he retired after the season. \\"I think what I will miss most is the competitiveness of the game,\\" Kison said upon retiring. \\"I‚Äôll also miss the camaraderie of my teammates.‚Äù During a 15-year career, Kison compiled 115 wins with 88 losses, 1,073 strikeouts, and a 3.66 ERA. In postseason games, he had a 5‚Äì1 record with 27 strikeouts and a 1.98 ERA in 36‚Öì innings. =Coaching= Following his playing career, Kison rejoined the Pirates as a minor league pitching instructor. He later spent time as the Kansas City Royals' bullpen coach (1992‚Äì93), the Royals' pitching coach (1994‚Äì98), and the Baltimore Orioles' pitching coach (1999). He was later a scout for the Orioles for more than ten years, retiring after the 2017 season. =Pitching style= Kison threw a fastball, a hard slider, and offspeed pitches, though he was at his best when he could rely on the fastball and slider. When he first reached the major leagues, he had a sidearm delivery. However, after he battled injuries from 1971 through 1973, he changed to a three-quarter delivery, which gave him better control and relieved pressure on his shoulder. He was not a strikeout pitcher; in a 15-season career, he only had more than 100 strikeouts three times in a season, and in 1975, he had more walks (92) than strikeouts (89). Despite that, Kison had an ERA above the league average most years, and he finished his career with more than a hundred more innings pitched () than hits allowed (1693). He tended to hit a lot of batters in his career; once, in the minor leagues, he hit seven in a game. Pat Jordan of Sports Illustrated attributed the hit-by-pitches to a late-breaking fastball and the need to throw inside pitches to keep his curveball effective. Personal life Kison married the former Anna Marie Orlando after Game 7 of the 1971 World Series, flying straight from the game to the wedding in a helicopter and a Learjet. The couple had two children, Robbie and Jennifer. During his time with the Pirates, Kison became good friends with Rich Gossage. Some of Kison's hobbies were hunting and fishing. In the early morning of June 2, 2018, Kison died at age 68 after a battle with cancer.

Early career James Morrison was a native of Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland where his father was a merchant and land entrepreneur. He joined the navy at 18, serving as clerk in the Suffolk, midshipman in the Termagant, and acting gunner in the Hind. In 1783, he passed his master gunner's examination. The Bounty James Morrison was the boatswain's mate on board the Bounty. The master gunner's position having been filled two days prior to his application, he may have taken the lesser post because of his eagerness to go along on the 'scientific expedition.' After the mutiny, Morrison was one of 16 mutineers who returned to Tahiti after the failed attempt to build a colony on Tubuai, while Fletcher Christian and 8 others sailed the Bounty on to Pitcairn Island. Along with the others who then lived as 'beachcombers' in Tahiti, he was captured here by Captain Edward Edwards of HMS Pandora on 29 March 1791, and brought back to England for court martial. While on Tahiti, he led an eight-month effort to build a schooner from local timber with which he secretly hoped to get to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies and from there return to England. He kept this to himself until the project was nearing completion, when he took a few others into his confidence. The schooner completed and christened Resolution, they spent many days boiling seawater to get salt sufficient to cure hundreds of pounds of pork for which they in turn had to build casks. They departed from Tahiti the day before the Pandora dropped anchor in Matavai Bay; but in the end the voyage was given up as impracticable owing to their lack of navigation instruments, problems with the schooner's rigging and their inability to carry sufficient water. Captain Edward Edwards confiscated the schooner, ordered her re-rigged with canvas and rope from Pandora's stores and renamed her Matavai. Pandora departed with the mutineers locked up in \\"Pandora's Box\\", and the schooner, manned by some of the Pandoras, was taken along as a tender. Six weeks later Pandora and Matavai became separated, and after waiting for her for several weeks at the agreed rendez-vous Anamooka, Edwards, giving her and her crew up for lost, sailed on. The Pandora was later wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, and the surviving crew and prisoners, 99 men in all, had to use the ship's boats to continue on. When they reached Samarang, Java, the Matavai and her crew were there. Having arrived in Surabaya five weeks earlier, they were making their way to Batavia (Jakarta) under a military escort, the Dutch governor suspecting them of being pirates from the Bounty. Pleased to see their 'lost' shipmates again, they had a happy reunion. The schooner was eventually sold to a local merchant in Batavia. Court-martial At the court-martial judgment, delivered on 18 September 1792, Morrison was sentenced to be hanged. However the court recommended mercy to the King, and, perhaps aided by a letter testifying to his good character from Captain Stirling of the Termagant, he and Peter Heywood were pardoned on 26 October 1792. While incarcerated, Morrison wrote an account describing the Bounty's journey and the island and customs of Tahiti. He was very critical of Bligh's behavior toward his officers. He was even more critical of the officers at the time of the mutiny, writing \\"The behaviour of the Officers on this Occasion was dastardly beyond description none of them ever making the least attempt to rescue the ship...\\" Following his pardon, Morrison returned to naval service. He reached the rank of master gunner, and saw action in the Mediterranean. After serving as a gunnery instructor in Plymouth, he joined Admiral Sir Thomas Troubridge in his flagship HMS Blenheim, in which he had served as a young gunner's mate before his Bounty experience. Blenheim sank sometime in February 1807 in a tropical cyclone off Madagascar with the loss of all on board. In popular culture *Morrison's life was the subject of a novel in Scottish Gaelic, Iain F.

It was founded in 1805 and is the oldest publicly funded school in Canada. History On March 5, 1805, the New Brunswick Legislature passed, \\"An Act for encouraging and extending literature in the province.\\" The passage of this act led to the creation of The Saint John Grammar School to meet the needs of a \\"... proper and adequate educational institute\\" (SJHS) for boys. On March 19, 1805 Common Council granted ¬£100 towards the creation of a school building on Germain St. on land purchased from Mr. Thomas Horsfield. In 1819, Dr. Patterson started his fifty-one year reign as principal of the Grammar School. \\"The Commons Schools Act\\" of 1871 led to the Grammar School coming under the supervision of the School Board and the creation of the Girls' High School. By 1874 the closing exercises of the Grammar School and the Girls' High School were a joint venture. Victoria Girls School In 1876 the Victoria Building was opened as the girls' high school. Unfortunately, a year later the Great Fire destroyed both this new school and the \\"... ancient looking wooden building on the corner of Germain and Horsfield\\" (St. John High). A new Victoria School for girls was opened in 1878 but the Grammar School was located in a variety of buildings until a new high school building was erected on Union Street for both boys and girls. It opened as Saint John High School in 1897. Even though the students were housed in the same building, segregation of the sexes was an entrenched idea. Few students experienced academic instruction from members of the opposite sex. A few activities however, such as the school orchestra created in Saint John High School on Union Street 1898, were co-educational. This building served the students of SJHS until the 1930s when academic demands and curricular innovations necessitated the building of a new school. The school's current facility, designed by the architect Herbert Stanley Brenan, opened in 1932 with over 1100 students. Segregation of the sexes continued as a tradition, with the boys using the Duke Street entrance and the girls the Canterbury Street one. It was not until Dr. A. T. G. Harrison's tenure that classes became co-ed. Two additions have been made to this building since its opening. The \\"New Wing\\" added in 1964 houses the science labs, a double gymnasium and a swimming pool. In 1986 the school underwent major renovations updating its electrical needs, outfitting it with new windows, creating new computer labs and adding an enlarged modern library. Mr. Barry Harbinson, who retired as principal in June 2008, has included in the School Improvement Plan further requirements for the building. He has articulated the need for a fourth floor on the New Wing to house technology labs, thus freeing up desperately needed classroom space in the old building. Throughout its two-hundred-year-old history, numerous traditions have been established. The school colours, originally brown and blue, were changed to red and grey in 1903, and the school motto, \\"Vita Vitalis - A Life Worth While\\" was adopted in 1932. However, the school dress for graduation (ladies in white and gentlemen in suits) is as old as the school itself. The Alumni Association also has a long legacy since its establishment in 1897. One of their most noticeable ties with the past is their collection of class photographs dating back to 1896. Playing \\"find the ancestor\\" is a sport for many students, parents and visitors. International Baccalaureate In 1983, Dr. Jack Wagstaff, Mr. Richard Thorne and Mrs. Sandi Thorne initiated the research that led Saint John High to become the first accredited International Baccalaureate school in New Brunswick. Since its inception, Saint John High has witnessed a number of students fulfill the demanding schedule of the Diploma Programme or complete the internal and external assessment of the IB courses. Saint John High is the only public school in New Brunswick to currently offer students these courses. Hounds football Saint John High school's football team, coached by David Grandy, made it to the 2008 NBIAA high school football championship game after defeating Riverview Royals 21-8. It was the first time since 1981 for the Hounds. The Hounds lost the provincial game against the Bernice MacNaughton Highlanders.

Career Brooker, a former trapeze artist, started his career in acting in a casting magazine, \\"Dramalogue\\". The casting call was for a big man to play a role in an upcoming movie directed by Steve Miner; however it wasn‚Äôt until after Richard‚Äôs tryout that he found out it was for the role of Jason Voorhees in Friday the 13th: Part III. During filming of the series, Richard had to undergo hours of makeup work to play the role of Jason, as depicted in online photographs. According to the fan-made documentary, Friday the 13th Part III: The Memoriam Documentary, Brooker was at this point in the series the fittest Jason to be played. Notably, he is the first actor to don the now iconic hockey mask as Jason, which would later become the series trademark. He did all his own stunts and wore blue jeans and a sweatshirt for the duration of filming. Brooker also wore white foam padding under his sweatshirt throughout filming to give him a more stocky appearance due to Brooker‚Äôs slim and toned body. After his iconic role as Jason in Friday the 13th Part III, he made appearances in small film roles such as Deathstalker, Deep Sea Conspiracy, and the television series Trapper John, M.D.. Brooker later became a director for such notable series such as Bill Nye the Science Guy, and worked as producer on several sports channels and programs such as Fox and 20th Century FOX. He later shifted from filmmaking and acting to business, creating his own website design company, Production Access Network. Brooker had also patented a device that is used in mobile phone devices and in the movie industry, which led him to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development in 2006. Personal life He was in a relationship with Shannon McMurray from 1995 to 2000, with whom he had two daughters, Madison and Cameron. The two amicably split in mid-2000. He also had a passion for riding horses and the sport of Polo. Also had an avid passion for sailing, and for a time lived on his sail boat with his daughters. Adored by his fans, Brooker was a constant sight at the horror conventions throughout the country during the 2000s and 2010s; always happy to grant visitors a wish of an autograph or a photo opportunity. Along the way, he befriended fellow Jason alums Warrington Gillette, Ted White, C.J. Graham, Dick Wieand and Kane Hodder; as well as a host of cast members from different Friday the 13th films. His last convention appearance was in March 2013 at the Full Moon Tattoo and Horror Festival in Nashville, TN. Death Richard Brooker died of a suspected heart attack (the cause of death was later found to be undetermined) on 8 April 2013 at a hospital in Los Angeles, California at age 58; less than one month after his final convention appearance. His name appeared in episode 7 of Hell's Kitchen's 11th season, which paid tribute to him at the end of its 18 April 2013 broadcast. On 26 May 2017, Friday the 13th: The Game was released as a digital copy in the United States and certain parts of the world. Though Part III Jason‚Äôs motion capture work was done by Jason Veteran Kane Hodder, the image of Jason‚Äôs face behind the mask was of Brooker‚Äôs likeness as Jason; paying homage to his contribution to the series. On 13 January 2018 a fan-made documentary entitled Friday the 13th Part III: The Memoriam Documentary was published on YouTube. In the documentary, Brooker was memorialized by the people he worked with on the set of Friday the 13th Part III and remembered by friends and a cousin as a caring man who loved his fans and the people he worked with. Dick Wieand, who played Roy Burns in Friday the 13th: A New Beginning ended Brooker‚Äôs tribute with: \\"He was one of the good guys, and I am glad to have known him. And if I ever saw him again I‚Äôd say: ‚ÄòHey Richard, I know this little bar down in Santa Monica. Let‚Äôs go have a drink.\\" The documentary included interviews with Friday the 13th Part III stars David Katims, Larry Zerner, and Paul Kratka. Also interviewed was Adrienne King, actresses Eileen Dietz, Tracie Savage, Caroline Williams; as well as C.J. Graham and Dick Wieand the men who played Jason in Part VI and Part V respectively.

Both forms are recorded in Ayrshire and in Glasgow between the 13th and 16th centuries. The name means \\"smooth grassy place\\" in Northern Middle English.Snodgrass Family History from Ancestry.co.uk, accessed 14 August 2016. In 1528 a charter from the King lists the lands of \\"Snotgerss\\" as being one of the confirmed possessions of Hugh, third Earl of Eglinton;Metcalfe, page 88. the next record seen of the name is in the late 17th century. Snodgrass in America The first records of the Snodgrass family in the new world are in the early 18th century in Virginia. The Virginia town of Hedgesville (now West Virginia) was founded by William Snodgrass, who arrived in the American colonies in 1700. William Snodgrass is buried in the cemetery of Tuscarora Presbyterian Church in Berkeley County, West Virginia. Closer examination reveals a wave of immigrants from Scotland during the Highland Clearances, Highland Potato Famine (1846‚Äì1857), and Lowland Clearances; increasing family sizes probably prompted many Snodgrasses to leave when the land could no longer support all of them. From Pennsylvania and other ports-of-entry, they have spread across the North American continent and today there are in excess of 6,000 Snodgrass families in the United States and Canada. Snodgrass Clan In April 1979, a Certificate of Incorporation was granted to the Snodgrass Clan, Inc. by the state of Indiana. This was brought about by Scott F. Hosier, Jr. and Laurence E. Snodgrass. Through Hosier's efforts a \\"grant of arms\\" was granted to the Clan on March 15, 1984 by the Chief Herald of Ireland; however, the petition to be granted a \\"grant of arms\\" by Scotland was never finalized. In 1979, Hosier ordered and received the first order of the official Snodgrass tartan. The weave code for the Snodgrass tartan is \`K6 R2 Y2 B22 G26 B10 R2 Y2\`, which was sourced to Dgn. T. S.
