The armies of Spain and France, advancing into Kingdom of Sardinia, unsuccessfully attacked entrenched positions at the pass of Villafranca, defended by Anglo-Sardinian forces. Because of the high losses incurred, the defenders were forced to leave the harbour of Villafranca two days after the battle (22 April 1744). Situation in Italy 1744 had opened bleakly for the Spaniards in Italy. To the south the Austrians were steadily driving back General Montemar's army. Naples was threatened. Britain, boasting naval superiority in the Mediterranean, intervened on the side of Austria, and the Royal Navy everywhere harassed Spain's allies and frustrated Spanish war shipping. Genoa was blocked off by a British squadron, and Switzerland kept her borders closed to the passage of troops. Marching overland through allied France, the Infante Philip had easily conquered Savoy, but, starved of supplies, had been unable to advance against the Sardinians in the Alps. On 22 February, the Bourbon navies defeated the British off the coast of Toulon. The retreat of Admiral Matthews' fleet left the sea lanes temporarily under French and Spanish control. Supplies poured into Philip's camp. 20,000 Frenchmen under Louis Fran√ßois I, Prince of Conti were then dispatched to combine with Philip's 20,000 Spaniards, their goal being to force a passage into Lombardy and to unite with the Spanish army in the south. On 1 April, the allies crossed the Var and advanced into Nice, which fell without a fight. Villafranca lay before them. The battle The Sardinians led by Vittorio Francesco Filippo di Savoia, Marquis of Susa, the brother of the King Charles Emmanuel III, entrenched themselves along the heights of Villafranca. Their natural defences were formidable: the attackers, hemmed in by cliffs and precipices, faced a difficult climb up over rocks and boulders, in plain sight of Sardinian guns. The fortified camp was equipped with more than 80 guns of all calibres, landed from English ships stationed in the harbor, which were arranged in eleven batteries. Sardinian forces counted fourteen battalions of infantry. Admiral Matthews, meanwhile, had returned to the area and landed a contingent of British regulars, marines, and artillery specialists to bolster the Sardinian defence. This force joined the Sardinians on the heights, their guns bearing down on the French against whom they had only recently declared war (Britain had been fighting a war against Spain since 1739). Voltaire would later quip, \\"even in the Alps we could still find Englishmen to fight us.\\" Conti's first attack was launched the 14 April, but was suspended because of a storm. Finally Conti gave the assault on the fortified camp of Villafranca on the night of 19 to 20 April 1744. In the early stages of the battle the French and the Spaniards were able to immediately gain the position of the collet de Villefranche, capturing or destroying five Sardinian battalions. Even the commander in chief, the Marquis of Susa, was taken prisoner and he had to be replaced by the Knight of Cinzano. The French and Spanish forces moved to conquer the positions of Mont Gros, Mont Rouge and Mont Leuze, the keys of the defensive perimeter of Villafranca. However, led by their new commander, the defenders were able to contain the attack. In particular, the regiment Kalbermatten, a Swiss unit in Sardinian service, was able to develop a magnificent defensive action to hold the position of Mont Leuze. At four in the afternoon the situation was restored and Conti had now exhausted all the forces at his disposal. The Cinzano had the opportunity to launch an assault on the collective Villefranche and reoccupy the position, which is crucial as it allowed the transit of the road to Nice. This operation, conducted by principally by companies of grenadiers, achieved a complete success. In the evening the Sardinians were again deployed on the positions of the morning. Aftermath The defenders had suffered heavy losses. There were over 1,000 dead and wounded and 1,500 prisoners, compared to less than 3,000 losses of Spaniards and French, who counted among their ranks 433 men held captive. With only 5,000 men fit to fight, Cinzano preferred to abandon the fortified camp of Villafranca with the help of the British navy. On the evening of 21 April, in the dock of Villafranca, the garrison was shipped aboard 33 ships escorted by four British warships. At the dawn of the 22 April the fleet left the port. The fort of Montalbano had been abandoned, but Cinzano had left a garrison of 340 soldiers in the Citadel of Villafranca, who surrendered on April 27. The Prince de Conti realized that the conquest of the Ligurian Riviera would cost several months of combat. He then preferred to attack the Alps in July, an action that allowed the breakthrough of the Italian front and the siege of the city of Cuneo.

He is best remembered as the friend and mentor of the famous naturalist and author Gerald Durrell, having appeared in such books as My Family and Other Animals, Birds, Beasts and Relatives, The Garden of the Gods and Fillets of Plaice by Gerald Durrell, Prospero's Cell by Lawrence Durrell, or The Colossus of Maroussi by Henry Miller. A polymath, Stephanides was respected as a scientist and doctor, and acclaimed as a poet in the English language. He also translated a sizeable body of Greek poetry into English, notably a significant body of work by Greek poet Kostis Palamas,\\"Editor's Introduction\\" (by Richard Pine), in Autumn Gleanings: Corfu Memoirs and Poems, pp. 9‚Äì11. the Greek near-epic work Erotocritos, and dozens of short poems of Sappho and other Ancient Greek authors.Sweet-Voiced Sappho: Some of the Extant Poems of Sappho of Lesbos and Other Ancient Greek Poems (translated by Theodore Stephanides). Stephanides was a noted biologist who has four species named after him. Three of them, Cytherois stephanidesi, Thermocyclops stephanidesi and Schizopera stephanidesi, are microscopic water organisms discovered by Stephanides in 1938,Peter G. Sutton, \\"Durrellian Odyssey: An Entomological Journey to the Island of Corfu\\", Antenna, 36 (4), 2012, pp. 224‚Äì233. and the fourth is Arctodiaptomus stephanidesi, a crustacean (copepod), described as Diaptomus stephanidesi by Otto Pesta in 1935.Arctodiaptomus stephanidesi (Pesta, 1935) on Fauna Europaea. Stephanides wrote A Survey of the Freshwater Biology of Corfu and of Certain Other Regions of Greece (1948), a definitive biological treatise on the freshwater life in Corfu, which is still cited today. His autobiographical account of the Battle of Crete, Climax in Crete (1946), and his half-fictional account of Corfu and the Ionian Islands, Island Trails (1973), were widely read in the past, but are now out of print.  Biography  = Childhood in Bombay and Corfu = Theodore Stephanides in Bombay, 1901 (apparently on the left, probably with his mother and brother). Theodore Philip Stephanides was born in Bombay, present-day India, to Philip (Philippos) Stephanides, a native of Thessaly, Greece, and Caterina Ralli, born and educated in London. His father worked for the international company of Ralli Brothers, whose family was originally from Chios, Greece, and married the boss‚Äôs daughter. Theodore spent his early years in Bombay, and accordingly, his native language was English, which he spoke with a clear British accent.The Garden of the Gods (BBC documentary, 1967). When his father retired in 1907, they moved to Corfu, where the Rallis family had an estate. It was only then that he began to learn Greek, at the age of eleven. = World War I and the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922) = Theodore Stephanides in the Greek Army on the Macedonian front, 1917 (he describes this period in his book Macedonian Medley). During the First World War, which began when Stephanides was eighteen years of age, he served as a gunner in the Greek army on the Macedonian front, following which he saw service in the disastrous Anatolian campaign of 1919‚Äì1922.Anthony Hirst, \\"Theodore Stephanides at the Macedonian Front, 1917‚Äì1918\\", presentation (Saturday 12 May 2018) at the Conference \\"The Macedonian Front 1915‚Äì1918: Politics, Society & Culture in Time of War\\", Thessaloniki, May 10‚Äì13, 2018. Subsequently, Stephanides wrote an account of his participation, in 1917The 1917 year is given by Anthony Hirst. However, as mentioned elsewhere by the same Hirst, Stephanides started to serve on the Macedonian front in June 1916.‚Äì1918 (at the age of twenty-one to twenty-two), in Greek artillery brigades in the Macedonian campaign. He deposited a copy of the unpublished typescript in the Imperial War Museum in London in the 1970s. First started in the 1920s, completed in 1931, revised in the 1960s, and entitled Macedonian Medley, it was based on a diary that he kept on a daily basis during his two periods of duty on the Macedonian front (June 1916 to February 1918, and August to October 1918). Stephanides served for eighteen months in a sector of the Macedonian front where no major battles took place over this time. This was the area to the south of Ghevgheli (in Bulgarian hands) and close to the towns of Kilkis and Isvor (in Allied territory) where the front lines scarcely shifted at all in this period. Stephanides moved about a lot within the sector, since much of his work involved laying telephone and power lines between positions, and, speaking English and French (in addition to Greek), he was also often sent to liaise with nearby British and French units. In 1921‚Äì1922, Stephanides was detained and court-martialed for \\"insulting\\" King Constantine I of Greece. It was caused by his political views and his frustration with the Greek military authorities. Plans exist to publish Macedonian Medley. Although Stephanides' wartime experiences were not very successful, the accounts of his service are typical not only of his own wry humour in reporting them, but also of the way in which his acquaintances relished the bizarre situations in which he found himself. Thus, Alan G. Thomas, a close friend of both Stephanides and Lawrence Durrell, the editor of the latter's book Spirit of Place, mentions the following amusing incident which occurred during the war: > From time to time Theodore reminisces about his days as a gunner. No man, it > seems, could be commissioned as an artillery officer unless he had directed > the fire of a gun at least once. At that time the allied armies were cooped > up within a narrow territory, each unit almost on top of another. Theodore > was given the relative data the night before the test, and, determined to > succeed, worked out the bearings over and over again with his habitual > scientific accuracy. The great moment came, the gun fired, and the > projectile landed upon a tent, belonging to the medical corps, in which a > surgical operation was in progress. Absolutely certain that his calculations > were correct, Theodore insisted that they be investigated; he was proved > right, the data being based on true north, while the gun had been \\"laid\\" by > magnetic north. \\"I am probably the only doctor,\\" Theodore is accustomed to > recall with a smile, \\"who has dropped a shell into an operating > theatre.\\"Lawrence Durrell, Spirit of Place: Essays and Letters on Travel, > edited by Alan G. Thomas, first published in 1969, Open Road Integrated > Media, 2012. Stephanides' experience in the Anatolian campaign was no less undistinguished. Gerald Durrell reports the following story as narrated by Stephanides himself. His commanding officer gave him the task of leading the entry into Smyrna on a white horse. This is what followed: > As I was riding along at the head of the column, an old woman darted out of > a side street and started to hurl eau-de-Cologne about. The horse did not > mind that, but most unfortunately a small quantity of the scent must have > splashed into his eye. Well, he was quite used to parades and so forth, and > cheering crowds and things, but he was not used to having his eye squirted > full of eau-de-Cologne. He became... er... most upset about it and was > acting more like a circus horse than a charger. I only managed to stay on > because my feet had become wedged in the stirrups. The column had to break > ranks to try to calm him down, but he was so upset that eventually the > commander decided it would be unwise to let him take part in the rest of the > triumphal entry. So while the column marched through the main streets with > bands playing and people cheering and so forth, I was forced to slink > through the back streets on my white horse, both of us, to add insult to > injury, by now smelling very strongly of eau-de-Cologne.Gerald Durrell, My > Family and Other Animals, in The Corfu Trilogy, London: Penguin Books, 2006, > pp. 111-112. = 1920s: study of medicine in Paris, translation of poetry = During 1922‚Äì1930, Stephanides studied medicine at the University of Paris (specialization of radiology), where one of his professors was Marie Curie.Marios-Byron Raizis, \\"Lawrence Durrell and the Greek Poets: A Contribution to Cultural History\\", in Anna Lillios (Ed.), Lawrence Durrell and the Greek World (Susquehanna University Press, 2004), pp. 250‚Äì252. In Paris, he also discovered and developed his passion for astronomy, which remained his chief interest right up to his death, a fact reflected in many of his poems. He was encouraged in this pursuit by one of the leading French astronomers, Camille Flammarion, who wanted to make Theodore his chief pupil and heir. In the 1920s, Stephanides began his work as a translator of Greek poetry into English. In 1925 and 1926, he published two volumes of Greek poems belonging to Kostis Palamas and other modern Greek poets. These translations were coauthored with George Katsimbalis (also known as Georgios Konstantinou Katsimpales), the man portrayed (along with Stephanides himself and Lawrence Durrell) in Henry Miller's novel The Colossus of Maroussi. They met during World War I and would become lifelong friends and collaborators. = 1930s: return to Corfu, meeting the Durrell family = In the 1930s, Stephanides practiced in Corfu as a radiologist and married Mary Alexander (a granddaughter of a former British consul in Corfu), with whom he had one daughter, Alexia Stephanides-Mercouri (1931‚Äì2018).Catherine Brown, \\"Athens Diary 2018\\". Alexia was a close friend of Gerry Durrell as a child in Corfu.Alexia Stephanides-Mercouri: \\"My father always hoped that Gerry and I would marry\\".Alexia Stephanides-Mercouri, the daughter of Theodore Stephanides, died on 28 October 2018. Later, she married Spyros Mercouris (1926‚Äì2018), brother of Greek actress Melina Mercouri.\\"RIP Spyros Mercouris (1926‚Äì2018), political activist, curator and organiser of the first European Capital of Culture programme; brother of Melina Mercouri\\". They had two children, Pyrrhus and Alexander Mercouris.Catherine Brown, \\"Corfus of the Mind\\". In the 1930s, Stephanides also developed his skills as a freshwater biologist and as a microscope expert. During 1938‚Äì1939, he conducted significant work for the anti-malaria campaign in Salonica and Cyprus, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, returning occasionally to Corfu.Theodore Stephanides, Autumn Gleanings, p. 75. At this stage Stephanides had already written his scientific magnum opus, a treatise on the freshwater biology of Corfu, commissioned in 1936 by the Greek government, which was eventually published in 1948, and had been credited with the discovery of three microscopic water organisms, Cytherois stephanidesi, Thermocyclops stephanidesi and Schizopera stephanidesi. As is evident from his memoirs of Corfu, Stephanides was also an astronomer, and is the only person to have named after him not only three of nature's smallest water creatures but also a crater on the moon (\\"R√∂mer A\\" is unofficially named ‚ÄòStephanides crater‚Äô). Stephanides started Corfu field work in 1933, based on directives from the Corfiot health authorities to prepare a report on the principal localities where anti-malarial measures would be necessary. In 1935, he was introduced to the Durrell family by their common friend George Wilkinson.Theodore Stephanides, Autumn Gleanings, pp. 25‚Äì26. Gerald and Lawrence Durrell would remain his lifelong friends. He was a meticulous proof-reader for Gerald Durrell's My Family and Other AnimalsDouglas Botting, Gerald Durrell: The Authorised Biography, p. 229. and Lawrence Durrell's The Greek Islands. Theodore Stephanides in Corfu, about 1938. In March 1973, in the introduction to Stephanides' book Island Trails, Gerald Durrell recorded: > I have known Theodore Stephanides since I was the tender age of ten, on the > enchanted island of Corfu. He strolled into my life, tweed-suited, trilby- > hatted, his walking stick with its tiny net on the end, his bag of test > tubes and bottles slung on his hip, his beard twinkling in the sun; a sort > of walking hirsute encyclopaedia. The effect of Theodore's erudition on a > budding naturalist of ten was enormous. To me, just starting to explore and > learn about the world I lived in, to have Theodore as guide, philosopher and > friend was one of the most important things that have happened to me in my > life. Not many young naturalists have the privilege of having their > footsteps guided by a sort of omnipotent, benign and humorous Greek god. So > closely did Theodore resemble my heroes of that period (the great > naturalists like [Charles] Darwin, [Alfred Russel] Wallace, [Jean-Henri] > Fabre, Gilbert White) that it was as though he had stepped straight out of > the pages of their books. Theodore had and has all the best qualities of the > Victorian naturalists: insatiable interest in the world he inhabits, and > that ability to illuminate any topic with his own observations and thoughts. > This, coupled with a puckish sense of humour, a prodigious memory and an > ability to pack forty-eight hours into twenty-four, makes up a very > extraordinary man. Theodore's wide interests are, I think, summed up by the > fact that ‚Äì in this day and age ‚Äì he is a man who has a microscopic water > crustacean named after him as well as a crater on the moon.Theodore > Stephanides, Island Trails, Introduction by Gerald Durrell, pp. ix‚Äìxi. In My Family and Other Animals, Gerald wrote of their first meeting with Stephanides as follows: > He had a straight, well-shaped nose; a humorous mouth lurking in the ash- > blond beard; straight, rather bushy eyebrows under which his eyes, keen but > with a twinkle in them and laughter-wrinkles at the corners, surveyed the > world.Gerald Durrell, My Family and Other Animals, in The Corfu Trilogy, > London: Penguin Books, 2006, p. 75. In Prospero's Cell, Lawrence Durrell gave the following description of Stephanides: > For Theodore's portrait: fine head and golden beard: very Edwardian face ‚Äì > and perfect manners of Edwardian professor. Probably reincarnation of comic > professor invented by Edward Lear during his stay in Corcyra [Corfu]. > Tremendous shyness and diffidence. Incredibly erudite in everything > concerning the island.

When Henry Miller met Stephanides in 1939, he thought: > Theodore is the most learned man I have ever met, and a saint to boot.Henry > Miller, The Colossus of Maroussi, London: Seeker and Warburg, 1942, p. 15. Introducing Stephanides' \\"A Synoptic History of Corfu\\", John Forte referred to him as \\"an integral part and parcel of the island of Corfu\\", adding that Stephanides \\"could in fact be described as a Corfiot institution\\".\\"A Synoptic History of Corfu\\", in John Forte (ed.), Corfu: Venus of the Isles, Essex: East Essex Gazette, 1963. In June 1940, Stephanides left for Cyprus to join the Royal Army Medical Corps of the British Army.Theodore Stephanides, Autumn Gleanings, pp. 76‚Äì77. Although Stephanides had left Corfu at the outbreak of the Second World War, returning only infrequently, the island had been an inspiration to the young Stephanides, as it was in turn to the young Gerald Durrell (they were of very similar ages when they made their \\"landfall\\" here), and this is clear in the many references to the island in Stephanides' poems, and, of course, explicit in his memoir of Lawrence Durrell at Kalami and Palaeocastritsa (Corfu Memoirs, published in Autumn Gleanings). = World War II, memoir Climax in Crete= During World War II, due to his dual Greek and British nationality, Stephanides served as a medical officer (lieutenant, and later major) in the Royal Army Medical Corps in Greece, Crete, Sicily and the Sahara. In May 1941, Stephanides was in Crete with the Allied troops when the Germans suddenly attacked the island by air. After several days of heavy bombings and machine-gunning by the Stukas, the Allies started retreating across the island, from Souda to Sfakia, to be evacuated by sea. Theodore had to walk about sixty kilometers in boots several sizes too large, which caused him great pain and badly chafed his feet. During the last stage of their march, he and another medical officer took charge of a group of about one hundred walking wounded, and they had to walk in open under the protection of the Red Cross flag. Eventually, they succeeded to reach the embarkation beach and were evacuated by H.M.A.S. Perth to Alexandria.Theodore Stephanides, Climax in Crete. In 1946, Stephanides published Climax in Crete, a vivid eyewitness account of the Battle of Crete. Lawrence Durrell wrote the foreword to it, where he remarked: > This sober and factual account of war experience in Greece and Crete can > claim none of the journalistic virtues of immediate topicality, > sensationalism, or inaccuracy. It was not written for publication, and it is > completely free from literary inflation of any kind. But for clearness, > accuracy, and unselfconsciousness it is quite fit to rank beside the > compilations of any modern Purchas. ... In the solid virtue of observed > detail it evokes the atmosphere of Greece and Crete during the German attack > with a fidelity I have not seen elsewhere equalled; and to those who were > there it will no doubt come as a refreshment after the scrappy sensational > prose works of the professional journalists. Certainly as a record of an > epoch-making campaign it must outlive, by its very humility and simplicity > and probity, more pretentious books.Theodore Stephanides, Climax in Crete, > Foreword by Lawrence Durrell, pp. 5‚Äì6. Lawrence's brother, Gerald Durrell, wrote on Climax in Crete as follows: > One of the best war books written and now [in 1973], alas, out of print. > Retreating across Crete with the Allied Army in World War Two, Theodore, the > most unwarlike of men, was bombed and machine-gunned with the rest by the > Germans. Yet who but Theodore would relate how, when the Stukas dived and > machine-gunned the road, he flung himself face downwards in a ditch and was > ‚Äòinterested to note‚Äô two species of mosquito larvae he had not ‚Äòpreviously > encountered‚Äô? Who but Theodore would observe that the exhausted troops, > sleeping under the olive trees, would all cease snoring without waking, as > soon as they heard the drone of an aeroplane, and would recommence snoring > as the sound died away?

Climax in Crete was quoted extensively by English military historian Antony Beevor in his book Crete: The Battle and the Resistance (1991). During his stay in Crete, Stephanides did an English translation of the famous German song Lili Marleen, which, according to him, \\"is far better than any of the others I have heard, as it is closer to the original and can be fitted more snugly to the tune\\". He included this translation in Climax in Crete.Theodore Stephanides, Climax in Crete, pp. 47‚Äì48. Stephanides' parents and numerous friends died in Corfu as a consequence of German strafing and bombing. Stephanides' wife Mary and daughter Alexia, who were living in London, were sent to live with the Durrells in Bournemouth during the London Blitz of 1940‚Äì1941. Stephanides' experiences in the Western Desert are described in his two memoirs, Western Desert Scramble and Western Desert and Beyond, which are kept, along with Macedonian Medley; 1917‚Äì1918, in the Imperial War Museum in London.Private Papers of Dr Theodore Stephanides in the Imperial War Museum. Neither of these three memoirs have been published yet. = Postwar period: moving to London = St Thomas' Hospital in London where Theodore Stephanides worked as an assistant radiologist after World War II. Shortly after the end of World War II, Stephanides retired from the British Army and rejoined his family in London, working as an Assistant Radiologist at St. Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth district of London, from 1945 until his retirement in 1961. The publication of Climax in Crete in 1946 was followed by two noted scientific works: The Microscope and the Practical Principles of Observation (1947), a detailed guide to microscope operation and use, and the seminal A Survey of the Freshwater Biology of Corfu and of Certain Other Regions of Greece (1948). In the epilogue to Island Trails, Stephanides describes how his books, scientific collections and most of his notes were destroyed during World War II in air attacks on Corfu town. However, A Survey of the Freshwater Biology of Corfu and of Certain Other Regions of Greece was saved by a happy chance and was published in 1948 by the Hellenic Institute of Freshwater Biology. Stephanides adds humorously: > I have never heard of it becoming a best seller in spite of the fact that it > contains, among other good things, a suggestive account of the sexual > aberrations of the water-flea Cyclops bicuspidatus Claus var. lubbocki > Brady.Theodore Stephanides, Island Trails, pp. 253‚Äì254. In 2012, Peter G. Sutton, a British biologist and science teacher, highly praised A Survey of the Freshwater Biology of Corfu and of Certain Other Regions of Greece: > It is no surprise that the studies of this remarkable man [Stephanides] made > their way into The Bulletin of Entomological Research ... and I have been > astonished by the fact that so many pathways of knowledge, from the > completion of a modern checklist for the Odonata, to the investigation of > water beetles, and even the study of the freshwater crab, Potamon > fluviatile, must all proceed through his original work on the freshwater > biology of the island, or risk error. ...

Theodore Stephanides visiting Corfu with the BBC in 1967. Stephanides continued to write and undertake research, appearing with Gerald Durrell in the BBC documentary on Corfu, The Garden of the Gods (1967). He wrote on this as follows: > Since the Second World War I have only revisited Corfu for a few months > during the summer season. The last time was in 1967, when I helped Gerald > Durrell and Christopher Parsons to complete the B.B.C. television travelogue > Corfu, Garden of the Gods.Theodore Stephanides, Island Trails, p. 253. Stephanides also worked on a proposed but unrealised collaboration with Lawrence Durrell on the history of the Karaghiozis shadow theater, which they had first encountered in Corfu in the 1930s. Stephanides describes Karaghiozis in Corfu Memoirs (chapter [9], \\"Lawrence Durrell and the Greek Shadow Play\\") and, more extensively, in Island Trails (chapter 3, \\"Phaeacia Again\\"). Lawrence Durrell also devoted a chapter to Karaghiozis in his book Prospero's Cell (chapter IV, \\"Karaghiosis: The Laic Hero\\"). Stephanides gained much praise and good standing as a poet after the back-to-back publication of his poetry collections The Golden Face (1965) and The Cities of the Mind (1969). He also went on to publish the personal collection of poems Worlds in a Crucible (1973). In addition, he continued translating the poetry of Kostis Palamas in collaboration with George Katsimbalis. Katsimbalis himself said that his own contribution was unnecessary, since Stephanides had sufficient command of both Greek and English, but Theodore seems to have felt a need for a second opinion from someone steeped in Greek literature, and his volumes, whether or not Katsimbalis contributed much to the translations, appeared under both their names. Other widely praised translation by Stephanides, that of the national Greek poem Erotocritos, was published posthumously in 1984. The volume was dedicated to Lawrence and Gerald Durrell. Marios-Byron Raizis (1931‚Äì2017), a renowned Greek-American Byronist and Romanticist, greatly praised Stephanides' talent as a poet and translator, stating: > Had Theodore Stephanides been less Greek at heart, and had he anglicised his > father's surname as Stephenson or Stevens, I believe that his fame as an > English poet and translator would have been part of the English literary > culture we all love, study, and celebrate today. In 1973, Stephanides published Island Trails, a half-fictional account of Corfu and the Ionian Islands, basically a collection of Greek folklore collected by him over the years. It was prefaced by Gerald Durrell and has since become a bibliographical rarity.

Palm-leaf manuscript. Nalanda, Bihar, India Tushita or Tusita (Sanskrit: Tu·π£ita) (meaning \\"contented\\" or \\"joyous\\") is the fourth of the six deva or heavenly realms of Kamadhatu in Buddhist tradition. It is located between the \\"YƒÅmƒÅ deva\\" realm and the \\"Nirmanarati deva\\" realm in Buddhist cosmology. Like the other heavens (deva realms), Tusita is said to be reachable through sƒÅdhanƒÅ, or advanced meditative attainments. It is the heaven where the Bodhisattva Svetaketu (Pali: Setaketu \\"White Banner\\") resided before being reborn on Earth as Gautama Buddha, the historical Buddha; it is the place where bodhisattvas, or future Buddhas reside before their rebirth as a Buddha.  Descriptions  Like all heavenly realms in Buddhism, the Tusita Heaven is the residence of divine beings or devas. According to the Visakhuposatha Sutta of the PƒÅli Canon,Visakhuposatha Sutta (AN 8.43) time there runs very differently than on Earth: Approximately, a deva month would be 12,000 years (four hundred times thirty), a deva year would be 144,000 years (twelve thousand times twelve), and a deva lifespan would be 576,000,000 years (a hundred forty four thousand times four thousand). According to the Dana Sutta, those who do meritorious deeds with the intention of helping others would tend to be reborn in Tusita Heaven upon death. Mahayana view The Infinite Life Sutra, a Mahayana text, states:Inagaki Hisao, trans., Stewart, Harold, The Three Pure Land Sutras, 2nd ed., Berkeley, Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research 2003, p. 3. Because Tusita Heaven is where all Bodhisattvas destined to reach full enlightenment in their next life dwell, heaven is therefore closely associated with Maitreya, the next Buddha. Many Buddhists vow to be reborn there so that they can hear the teachings of Maitreya and ultimately be reborn with him when he becomes a Buddha.

Any perspective has a different focus, conceptualization, dedication and visualization of what the model is representing. The traditional way to distinguish between modeling perspectives is structural, functional and behavioral/processual perspectives. This together with rule, object, communication and actor and role perspectives is one way of classifying modeling approaches.John Krogstie (2003). Conceptual modeling ,  Types of perspectives  =Structural modeling perspective= This approach concentrates on describing the static structure. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the entity, this could be an object, phenomena, concept, thing etc. The data modeling languages have traditionally handled this perspective, examples of such being: *The ER-language (Entity- Relationship) *Generic Semantic Modeling language (GSM) *Other approaches including: :*The NIAM language (Binary relationship language) :*Conceptual graphs (Sowa) Looking at the ER-language we have the basic components: *Entities: Distinctively identifiable phenomenon. *Relationships: An association among the entities. *Attributes: Used to give value to a property of an entity/relationship. Looking at the generic semantic modeling language we have the basic components: *Constructed types built by abstraction: Aggregation, generalization, and association. *Attributes. *Primitive types: Data types in GSM are classified into printable and abstract types. :*Printable: Used to specify visible values. :*Abstract: Representing entities. =Functional modeling perspective= The functional modeling approach concentrates on describing the dynamic process. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the process, this could be a function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known example of a modeling language employing this perspective is data flow diagrams. The perspective uses four symbols to describe a process, these being: *Process: Illustrates transformation from input to output. *Store: Data-collection or some sort of material. *Flow: Movement of data or material in the process. *External Entity: External to the modeled system, but interacts with it. Now, with these symbols, a process can be represented as a network of these symbols. This decomposed process is a DFD, data flow diagram. =Behavioral perspective= Behavioral perspective gives a description of system dynamics. The main concepts in behavioral perspective are states and transitions between states. State transitions are triggered by events. State Transition Diagrams (STD/STM), State charts and Petri-nets are some examples of well-known behaviorally oriented modeling languages. Different types of State Transition Diagrams are used particularly within real-time systems and telecommunications systems. =Rule perspective= Rule perspective gives a description of goals/means connections. The main concepts in rule perspective are rule, goal and constraint. A rule is something that influences the actions of a set of actors. The standard form of rule is ‚ÄúIF condition THEN action/expression‚Äù. Rule hierarchies (goal-oriented modeling), Tempora and Expert systems are some examples of rule oriented modeling. =Object perspective= The object- oriented perspective describes the world as autonomous, communicating objects. An object is an ‚Äúentity‚Äù which has a unique and unchangeable identifier and a local state consisting of a collection of attributes with assignable values. The state can only be manipulated with a set of methods defined on the object. The value of the state can only be accessed by sending a message to the object to call on one of its methods. An event is when an operation is being triggered by receiving a message, and the trace of the events during the existence of the object is called the object‚Äôs life cycle or the process of an object. Several objects that share the same definitions of attributes and operations can be parts of an object class. The perspective is originally based on design and programming of object oriented systems. Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a well known language for modeling with an object perspective. =Communication perspective= This perspective is based on language/action theory from philosophical linguistics. The basic assumption in this perspective is that person/objects cooperate on a process/action through communication within them. An illocutionary act consists of five elements: Speaker, hearer, time, location and circumstances. It is a reason and goal for the communication, where the participations in a communication act is oriented towards mutual agreement. In a communication act, the speaker generally can raise three claims: truth (referring an object), justice (referring a social world of the participations) and claim to sincerity (referring the subjective world of the speaker). =Actor and role perspective= Actor and role perspective is a description of organisational and system structure. An actor can be defined as a phenomenon that influences the history of another actor, whereas a role can be defined as the behaviour which is expected by an actor, amongst other actors, when filling the role. Modeling within these perspectives is based both on work with object-oriented programming languages and work with intelligent agents in artificial intelligence. I* is an example of an actor oriented language.

Asher (born May 2, 1939) is an English-American jingle writer and lyricist who collaborated with Brian Wilson in the co-writing of eight songs on the Beach Boys 1966 album Pet Sounds, including the singles \\"God Only Knows\\", \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", and \\"Caroline, No\\". According to Asher, he mainly provided the words to Wilson's compositions, but in some cases also contributed musical ideas. He also co-wrote songs with Roger Nichols. Pet Sounds Western Studio on Sunset Boulevard (2019) According to most sources, Asher met Wilson while recording at United Western Recorders in 1965. Other sources state that Wilson met Asher during a social gathering at mutual friend Loren Schwartz's house. Wilson biographer Peter Ames Carlin dates the initial meeting between Asher and Wilson to early 1963. Asher, in 1965, was a 26 year old lyricist and copywriter who had been working on advertising jingles. He was also a Beach Boys fan who felt that the group was distinct from most artists, releasing a string of hits where \\"you wouldn't even know, necessarily, that it was gonna be a Beach Boys record from the first bar or something.\\" He also confessed: \\"I didn't own any of their albums. I had Bill Evans albums.\\"* Asher explained that while in the studio: \\"I think we were recording some music, or voice-overs for a commercial and I had heard that the Beach Boys were in another studio. During a break, we kind of hung out in the hallway and eventually, sort of snuck into the booth and Brian was in the studio [alone]. ... eventually, we met.\\" Looking for a clean break from the by-then-famous Beach Boys sound (associated with surfing and cars) and not wanting to collaborate with any of the songwriters with whom he had previously worked, Wilson called Asher in early December 1965, and within ten days they had started to write what would eventually become Pet Sounds. Wilson and Asher wrote together for about three weeks. According to Asher, a typical writing session started either with Wilson's playing melody or chord patterns that he was working on, by discussing a recent record that Wilson liked the feel of, or by discussing a subject that Wilson had always wanted to write a song about. His contribution to the music itself was minimal, serving mainly as a source of second opinion for Wilson as he worked out possible melodies and chord progressions, although the two did trade ideas as the songs evolved. He characterized the experience as \\"writing an autobiography\\", however, \\"I wouldn't limit it to Brian's autobiography.\\" Contrary to the popular conception that Wilson composed all of the music to Pet Sounds, Asher contended that he also made significant musical contributions to \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\\", \\"Caroline, No\\", and \\"That's Not Me\\". Asher's impression of Wilson was of \\"the single most irresponsible person\\" he had ever met, remembering that there were uncashed royalty checks of up to $100,000 scattered around Wilson's house. He later called Wilson a \\"genius musician but an amateur human being\\". In 2013, he said that he \\"didn‚Äôt mean that in the way it came out\\" and explained: \\"We all have areas of things we‚Äôre good at and things we‚Äôre not so good at, but his is so zeroed-in on music.\\" Asher was particularly effusive about the way Wilson \\"hunt[ed] for a chord change ... the [same] way some of us type.\\" On \\"God Only Knows\\", Wilson reflected: \\"I think Tony had a musical influence on me somehow. After about ten years, I started thinking about it deeper ... because I had never written that kind of song. And I remember him talking about 'Stella by Starlight' and he had a certain love for classic songs.\\" Later career In the late 1990s, Wilson and Asher rekindled their writing partnership and wrote at least four songs together. Only two were released: \\"This Isn't Love\\" and \\"Everything I Need\\". A piano-only rendition of \\"This Isn't Love\\" was issued on the 1997 compilation Songs Without Words, while a full-band live performance was released on Wilson's 2002 album Live at the Roxy Theatre. In 1997, \\"Everything I Need\\" appeared on The Wilsons, a project involving Wilson and his daughters Carnie and Wendy.

The ring was known as Joe K because it was the signature used in letters sent to Berlin addresses giving information on Allied shipping in New York Harbor. Ludwig also used the code name Fouzie ‚Äî and at least 50 to 60 other aliases, both male and female. Early life and career Born in Fremont, Ohio, Ludwig was taken to Germany as a child in 1909, and there he grew up and married. He returned to the United States in 1925 but went back to Germany in 1933. He was arrested in Austria for espionage in February 1938 ‚Äî just prior to the Anschluss ‚Äî after police had noticed that he had been photographing bridges in the border between Germany and Austria; however, his case was delayed and when time came to act upon his case, the Nazis had taken over Austria the following month. Ludwig then returned to Germany and stayed there until March 1940, when he was ordered to return to the United States to establish a spy ring there. Setting up the ring Upon arrival Ludwig went to a boarding house located in Ridgewood, Queens, his operations being paid through the German consulate in New York. He set himself up as a leather-goods salesman and proceeded to recruit agents and couriers from various German-American Bund groups in the New York/Brooklyn area in preparation for his espionage activity: he recruited six men and two women for this purpose, several of whom had little practical experience in espionage. One of the two women was Lucy Boehmler, a pretty 18-year-old high school graduate from Maspeth, Queens, who joined up because she thought it might be fun. Ludwig made a practice of visiting docks in New York Harbor and along the New Jersey coast where, from his observations, he could report information to Germany on the identities of the ships and their cargoes. He also visited various U.S. Army posts, and reported on the identities of the individual units of each, as well as their organization and equipment which he felt would be of interest to his superiors. By December, Ludwig had also included information regarding aircraft manufacturing and performance based on his surveillance of aircraft plants in the Long Island area (notably Grumman, to which he assigned the code name \\"Grace\\"). The information gathered by the ring was sent as mail drops to accommodation addresses in neutral Spain, Portugal, Argentina, and even Germany itself. These harmless looking personal letters would be forwarded to appropriate person within Germany, their true messages hidden in invisible ink. Letters of the highest priority were bound for Heinrich Himmler, who was assigned the alias \\"Manuel Alonzo\\"; Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the RSHA was \\"Lothar Frederick\\". Other recipients were assigned similar code names. The search for the spy ring Authorities in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom were by that time aware that a spy ring was operating out of New York City. The first break came when British Imperial Censorship, located in the Princess Hotel in Bermuda and run by the British Security Coordination (BSC) ‚Äî actually a cover for the Secret Intelligence Service ‚Äî intercepted a letter written to \\"Lothar Frederick\\" and signed by a \\"Joe K\\". As it was known that \\"Lothar\\" was an alias used by Heydrich, a watch was set for any letter with the Joe K signature. Subsequent letters from Joe K were intercepted, their contents read and recorded, and the envelopes so carefully resealed that their recipients would not detect any evidence of tampering. Joe K had shown up as the signature on many letters sent to accommodation addresses. In March 1941 BSC chemists detected secret writing in a Joe K letter; the secret message referred to a duplicate letter sent to \\"Smith\\" in China. (The censor working on the Joe K correspondence was Nadya Gardner who conducted chemical tests and found secret writing in some letters, according to historian H. Montgomery Hyde.) The BSC mail-intercept operation was run in coordination with the FBI ‚Äî even though J. Edgar Hoover, the Director of the FBI, and William Stephenson, the head of the BSC, did not get along. The FBI was able to trace the Smith letter and found that it contained a plan of U.S. defenses in Pearl Harbor. Despite this break, they were still in the dark as to who were involved in the spy ring, until an unexpected event took place that led eventually to its unraveling and downfall. An accident in Times Square On the night of March 18, 1941, two men were reportedly arguing about the proper way to cross an intersection in a busy section of Times Square in New York when one of them, a middle-aged man wearing horn-rimmed spectacles and carrying a brown briefcase, foolishly made the attempt to cross the street against a traffic light. Meanwhile, Sam Lichtman, a cabdriver from southern Brooklyn was driving up 7th Ave. near 45th St. when suddenly a man darted in front of his cab. Despite his attempt to avoid a collision, the man was run down and fatally thrown under the wheels of another car. In the confusion, the man's companion took the brown briefcase and hurriedly fled the scene. The victim was rushed to St. Vincent's Hospital but he died within 24 hours. The fatally injured man was identified as a courier for the Spanish Consulate, Don Julio Lopez Lido. His body was unclaimed for a time but the Spanish Consulate in New York finally buried him. His companion, who ran from the scene, called the Taft Hotel where the dead man was staying and asked for them to hold the man's room until further notice. In the meantime, the hotel management had informed the local authorities, and they began to investigate the mysterious circumstances behind the accident. Investigation The New York Police had taken note of the seemingly uncaring action of Se√±or Lido's companion as reported by witnesses, and took a deeper look into the dead courier's background. Although he was identified as a Spaniard, they were puzzled by the fact that the dead man's papers were in German, not Spanish; his notebook contained names and possible assignments of some U.S. soldiers; his clothes contained no labels. Moreover, a check made at the hotel room yielded maps, articles on military aviation and other curious items. All of these items were turned over to the FBI. In the meantime, another Joe K message, also followed up by the FBI, contained a panicky message about a car in New York deliberately running down and killing a certain \\"Phil\\". The BSC had informed the FBI that \\"Phil\\" had been Captain Ulrich von der Osten of the German Abwehr who had entered the United States via Japan a month prior to his \\"removal from circulation\\": he was supposed to direct the activities of a group of spies in the U.S. Based on this, the FBI was able to determine that \\"Se√±or Lido\\" and von der Osten were one and the same. Piecing together a reference from \\"Phil's\\" notebook, an intercepted cable from Portugal to \\"Fouzie\\", and information from the Joe K letters themselves, the FBI was able to identify von Osten's companion as Ludwig himself. He was located and thus placed under surveillance to determine his contacts. Surveillance It was later known that von der Osten did arrive in the U.S. with the purpose of directing the Joe K spy ring; however, with his untimely death, Ludwig was left in command of the ring. Under FBI surveillance Ludwig was seen continuing his routine of visiting the docks in New York Harbor and U.S. Army posts around the state. On one occasion during May he took an extended trip to Florida, accompanied by Lucy Boehmler who acted as his \\"secretary\\" and courier who assisted him in preparing his reports and in maintaining detailed records of his observations by using a toothpick dipped in invisible ink. They stopped along the way at Army camps, airfields, and factories engaged in manufacturing wartime mat√©riel. When he arrived in Miami, Florida, Ludwig met up with an agent, Carl Hermann Schroetter, and through Schroetter Ludwig was able to send his reports on his observations during the trip, including the progress in the construction of a naval base in Miami. Associates Soon, the FBI was able to gather information on all who were connected with the Joe K spy ring, aside from Ludwig and Boehmler (ages given as of time of arrest and/or conviction): *Rene Charles Froehlich, 31, a German-born U.S. Army private who was stationed in Fort Jay, Governors Island in New York Harbor. He arranged mail drops for Ludwig and picked up his mail when Ludwig went out of town, as well as supplying defense magazines and gathering ship information; *Mrs. Helen Pauline Mayer, 26, a housewife who aided Ludwig in obtaining information about aircraft manufacturing in plants in the Long Island area; She was the one who introduced Lucy Boehmler to Ludwig. *Karl (or Carl) Victor Mueller, 36, a machinist who helped gather production figures; and *Hans Helmut Pagel, 20, and Frederick Edward Schlosser, 19, youths of German extraction who were recruited from the German- American Bund, assisted Ludwig in making observations of various docks and Army posts in the New York area and in mailing the reports through various mail drops. A ninth member of the ring, known only as \\"Robert,\\" was tracked down by the FBI through papers obtained from a janitor in a building that housed the German Consulate; the janitor was in charge of the burn-bag detail and regularly put papers in the furnace while the Germans watched. However, he would surreptitiously pull them out, douse the flames, and hand them over to the FBI. \\"Robert\\" was identified as Paul Borchardt (1886-1957), a World War I veteran who served in the German Army from 1913-1933. He later became an archeologist, but claimed that he was fired from his university post and confined in Dachau for being a Jew. Borchardt agreed to travel to the U.S. posing as a refugee and to spy for Germany due to patriotism. There was also a tenth member of the ring, codenamed \\"Bill\\", who was a German-born Argentinian named Teodore Erdman Erich Lau. He served as paymaster for the Joe K ring. Flight and capture When the Duquesne Ring was broken by the FBI in June, 1941, Ludwig and his associates decided to temporarily cease their activities in fear of being caught. Ludwig himself retreated to a summer resort in Pennsylvania, and then drove west in an effort to escape, driving his car along country roads through the Midwest at speeds of up to . He stopped at a cabin in Yellowstone National Park in August and tried ‚Äî unsuccessfully ‚Äî to destroy any incriminating evidence. When he arrived in Missoula, Montana, he stored his car, shipped his entire luggage except for the bare necessities to relatives in the East Coast, and continued his journey by bus. When the FBI searched his car, they found that he left behind his shortwave radio receiver. Believing that he was planning to leave the U.S. and make his way to Germany via Japan, the FBI arrested him at Cle Elum, Washington on August 23. They then rounded up the rest of the ring, except for Borchardt, who was arrested in December 8, Schroetter, who was arrested in Miami on September 2 and Lau, who eluded capture until October 18, 1946. Trial and conviction Ludwig and the rest of the Joe K spy ring were subsequently indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for treasonable conspiracy and espionage. Lucy Boehmler agreed to testify for the government against her co- defendants. Her quest for thrills already well dissipated, she also wanted to get back at Ludwig, who despite his promise to pay her $25 a week for her services more often than not withheld payment, allegedly because of her shoddy work abilities. She emerged as the star of the trial. On March 6, 1942 they were all found guilty of all charges. Mayer, Mueller and Pagel each received 15 years, Schlosser for 12 years, and Schroetter for 10. Lucy Boehmler was sentenced to five years. Because their spying was undertaken before the U.S. entered World War II, Ludwig, Borchardt, and Froehlich escaped the death penalty and were sentenced to 20 years. Kurt Frederick Ludwig was sent to Alcatraz Island to serve out his sentence. He was released in 1953 and deported shortly afterwards.

He is best remembered for being the first person in the main British battle fleet to sight the Franco-Spanish fleet, and did so without the use of a glass. The information was signalled to the fleet flagship, . Biography Brydone was born in Selkirk, Scotland, a descendant of William Brydone, who was town clerk of Selkirk at the time of the Battle of Flodden. He was educated at the local school alongside Mungo Park and Charles Malcolm. He qualified as a doctor of medicine from Edinburgh University and, after local experience, in 1804 found himself serving as assistant surgeon aboard the East Indiaman Calcutta. Whilst at sea the ship met a naval vessel whose surgeon had died. He was transferred over and thus began thirty years of service in the Royal Navy. Brydone later contracted yellow fever while at Calcutta, and was sent home to convalesce. By October 1805 he was serving as assistant surgeon on with Nelson's fleet in search of the French and Spanish. In the days of sail, early information was important when advantage had to be gained with the use of the wind. The British commander, Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson, had stationed a chain of frigates to watch the enemy fleet in Cadiz, which had already signalled the combined fleet had put to sea, and reported on its movements. Brydone was the first of the main battle fleet, patrolling off Cape Trafalgar, to see the sails on the horizon ‚Äì without the use of a glass ‚Äì and the location of the Franco-Spanish fleet was signalled to HMS Victory, three minutes later battle orders were signalled beginning the Battle of Trafalgar. Brydone saw further action at the siege of Gaeta (1806) and at the battle of Anholt (1811). After the battle Brydone treated British and Danish casualties alike, carrying out several amputations. Later Brydone's written testimony was presented at the court- martial of a Danish surgeon, accused of causing the death of a wounded Danish officer. He was subsequently acquitted. After the war Brydone served as the Surgeon Superintendent aboard the convict ship Eliza, which sailed from England on 12 October 1819, with 160 male convicts aboard, and arrived in Sydney Cove on 20 January 1820, having lost only one man during the voyage. Brydone remained in New South Wales until August 1820, and served as President of a Medical Board assembled by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Brydone eventually returned to England and joined under Captain James Gordon in 1821. He later served as assistant staff surgeon at Portsmouth and Deptford dockyards, and finally as staff surgeon at Deptford before retiring from the Navy in 1834. After his retirement from the Navy, Brydone was engaged by the Earl of Egremont to supervise the transport of Petworth Emigration Scheme emigrants to Canada. He laid down standards of accommodation on board ship and also of reception in Canada, making four trips between 1834 and 1837 to supervise and maintain discipline on board and see the migrants settled on arrival. In the summer of 1838 Brydone travelled to Ireland with Colonel George Wyndham, the 3rd Earl's son and heir, to inspect family estates in County Clare and Limerick, assisting the earl and encouraging emigration to Canada.Haines & Lawson (2007), p.201 After spending the winter on secretarial work for the Colonel he was asked to return to Ireland in 1839 to organise emigration. Most people by now preferred Australia as their destination, and at the end of May 183 people from Limerick sailed on the Waterloo. He then settled at Petworth where he became accountant and later acting land agent for Colonel Wyndham,Jerrome (2006), p.134 and died at the age of 86.

Roncalli was born in Bergamo on 6 March 1654 and baptized at the church of San Pancrazio in the Citt√† Alta in Bergamo on 8 June 1654. He was the younger son of Conte Giovanni Martino Roncalli (1626‚Äì1700) and brother of Francesco, Conte di Montorio (1645‚Äì1717). He was ordained to the priesthood and died in Bergamo on 25 August 1713. The Roncalli family still possess a portrait of him in clerical dress .A note on the back of the painting reads \\"Comes Ludovicus Roncalius I.V.D. [Iuris Utriusque Doctor) et abbas, et suis legatis ad Sancta exercitia promovenda insignis largitur. Obiit ann. 1713 Die 25 augusti. Aetatis sue ann. 59. men. sex\\". (Count Ludovico Roncalli, graduate in civil and canon law and priest, illustrious donor of his erudition for the promotion of spiritual exercises. Died in the year 1713, 25th day of August at the age of 59 years and 6 months). Another note in smaller letters reads \\"Ritratta quando era in et√† d‚Äôanni XXXII\\" (painted when he was 32 years of age). The portrait is reproduced in Dell'Ara's article and in the liner notes to the recordings of Jorge Oraison and Giacomo Parimbelli. A letter written by his brother Francesco to padre Martino is preserved in family archives. It refers to financial assistance given to Ludovico whilst he was in Rome in 1695. His reasons for visiting Rome are unknown but he may have been introduced to musical circles there by Cardinal Pamphilli to whom Capricci armonici is dedicated. He published a collection of nine suites for five-course baroque guitar, Capricci armonici sopra la chitarra spagnola (\\"Harmonic caprices for the Spanish guitar\\"), in 1692. This is dedicated to the well-known patron of music, Cardinal Benedetto Panfili, a great-grandson of Pope Innocent X who was Cardinal Legate in Bologna from 1690 and later librarian of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana in Rome . It was transcribed into modern notation and arranged for the six-string guitar by Oscar Chilesotti in 1881. The work consists of nine complete suites, each comprising a preludio and alemanda followed by some of the other seventeenth-century dance forms such as corrente, sarabanda, gigue, minuet and gavotta. The last movement of the ninth suite is a passacaglia which was orchestrated by Ottorino Respighi and included in his Ancient Airs and Dances Suite no. 3. Roncalli's music is a great favorite of guitar enthusiasts, and individual movements frequently appear in guitar method books. Frederick Noad, who compiled an anthology titled The Baroque Guitar, as well as other popular instruction books, did not rate the Chilesotti transcription highly, pointing to many omitted embellishments and octave errors relating to the fourth and fifth strings . Roncalli probably used a bourdon or low octave string only on the fourth course with the fifth course re-entrant ‚Äì a method of stringing particularly associated with his compatriot Francesco Corbetta and widely used in the later part of the seventeenth century ‚Äì e' bb gg dd' aa. Another edition in modern notation was published by Bruno Henze, and released in 1955 by VEB Friedrich Hofmeister, Leipzig. Noad did not comment on whether this edition had corrected the deficiencies of the Chilesotti version. The original is available in two facsimile editions, both published in 1979. Roncalli's Capricci armonici sopra la chitarra spagnola has been the exclusive subject of several recent recordings. One of the first was Sandro Volta's of suites I, II, IV, V, VII, and VIII on the Arion label in 1994 (ARN 68336). Jorge Orais√≥n recorded the entire cycle on 2 CDs for Vanguard Classics in 1996 (99151). Richard Savino recorded suites I, II, III, V, VII, and VIII for Dorian in 2008 (DSL-90604). Volta, Orais√≥n, and Savino used five-course guitars for their Roncalli recordings. In 2004 another recording devoted exclusively to Roncalli's work was released on the Italian label Tactus. It features Giacomo Parimbelli performing the complete suites except for V, VI, and IX, on a 19th- century instrument.

He won the Caulfield Cup in Melbourne five times: 1942-45 consecutively on Tranquil Star, Skipton, Counsel and St Fairy; then on Peshawar in 1952. He also won The Derby twice, and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe once. Breasley was born in 1914 in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales and was christened Arthur Edward, but while still very young was given the nickname \\"Scobie\\", after the famous Australian trainer and jockey James Scobie. During his career, Breasley rode 3,251 winners including over 1,000 in Australia and 2,161 in Britain. He rode over 100 winners in Great Britain every year from 1955 to 1964, and was Champion Jockey in 1957 and continuously from 1961‚Äì63. He won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe for the only time on Ballymoss in 1958, and the Derby for the first time at the age of 50 on Santa Claus in 1964, then again on Charlottown in 1966. He developed a great rivalry with Sir Gordon Richards, and later with the younger jockey Lester Piggott. He was renowned for his exquisite balance in the saddle, for refusing to race wide, and for his sparing use of the whip, preferring to use hands and heels. Breasley retired as a jockey in 1968 and took up training in Epsom (UK), France, the United States, and Barbados, where he and his wife owned a holiday home. He retired from training horses after winning the most prestigious race in Barbados - the Gold Cup - on four occasions in the early 1990s and returned to live in Melbourne. The racing authorities in the state of Victoria struck a medal in his honour, awarded annually since 1996 to the best jockey in the state. On its formation, Scobie Breasley was the first person inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame. In 1999, the Racing Post ranked Breasley as tenth in their list of the Top 50 jockeys of the 20th century.

Origins The organization was born as the result of a political union between the leftist Chadian National Union (UNT), led by Ibrahim Abatcha, and the General Union of the Sons of Chad (Union G√©n√©rale des Fils du Tchad or UGFT) which was led by Ahmed Hassan Musa. Musa was close to the Muslim Brotherhood and was an Islamist. The UGFT remained autonomous within the new group under the banner of the Liberation Front of Chad (FLT). The union was agreed at the Nyala Congress, in Sudan, between June 19 and June 22 of 1966. The group's flag was approved at the same congress. Secretary- general was proclaimed Abatcha, while another cadre of the UNT, Abou Bakar Djalabou, was designed to lead the delegation that was to represent the movement abroad. A committee was also selected at the congress, composed of thirty members taken equally from the UNT and the FLT. The front was composed exclusively by Muslim northerners, and there was to be no attempt to create a link with the Southern expatriates in the Central African Republic.Nolutschungu, p. 58 The movement's official program, also approved at the Nyala congress, proclaimed the rejection of secession, confessional politics and ethnic discrimination, and that neocolonialism should be fought in order to \\"regain the total national independence of our fatherland\\". A coalition government, national and democratic, was to be formed, and all political prisoners freed. All foreign troops were to leave, and support was to be given to national liberation movements, and a foreign policy of positive neutrality searched. Quite vague were the economic objectives: wages would be raised, arbitrary taxes abolished and the land given to the tillers. In conclusion, \\"the document was so vague and so general it could have been written for any country under the sun.\\"Nolutschungu, pp. 58‚Äì59 While the FROLINAT was originally composed of few members, it could count on the fact that the Chadian state was already in disarray; the southern-dominated government despised and bypassed the Muslim traditional leaders, and already in 1963 the most important Northern politicians had been arrested, and all important positions in the Chadian Armed Forces and in the local administration was kept by non-Muslim Southerners. To cite Sam Nolutschungu, \\"everyone knew that the regime was corrupt, cruel, arbitrary, and absurd.\\"Nolutschungu, p. 57 This miscontent generated already in November 1965 the bloody Mangalm√© riots, that gave way to a number of loosely knitted peasant revolts in central and eastern Chad, that from Mangalm√© and nearby Batha Prefecture, rapidly spread to Ouadda√Ø and Salamat prefectures, where in February 1967 the prefect and his deputy were killed. In northern Chad, in the BET Prefecture, also in 1965 unrest had started expanding. So Abatcha, when with seven North Korean trained companions, penetrated in Eastern Chad in November 1966, could count on a territory that was already in full revolt.A Country Study: Chad, \\"Rebellion in Eastern and Northern Chad\\" Musa and the most conservative elements of the FLT pulled out of the FROLINAT already at the end on 1966, but a dualism was always to remain between the socialist, anti-imperialist, even Pan-African UNT element and more the conservative and regionalist UGFT tradition. Another element of division consisted in the dualism between the two originary areas of the rebellion, that is Kanem and the East: the first region mainly attracting support from Chadians living in Egypt and the Central African Republic, the second mainly from Sudan. With the forces of both groups combined began in the same year to operate in the mid- east of the country, under the direct command of Abatcha. Shortly after, in March 1968, a lieutenant of Abatcha, Mohammed Taher, instigated a mutiny by the Daza Toubou of the Nomad and National Guard (GNN) of Aozou, that was evacuated by the national army in September. Taher had already recruited militants among the Teda Toubou in the Borkou, and shortly after the Aozou mutiny obtained the support of Goukouni Oueddei, an influential figure among the Teda of the Tibesti and son of the derde of the Toubou, Oueddei Kichidemi. This extended the insurgency to the north and Toubou nomads, adding a new element of complexity to the rebellion and bringing in the support to the movement of the Chadians living in Libya, and especially the students of the Islamic University of Bayda.J. Fearon & D. Laitan, Chad - Random Narratives Dissensions On February 11, 1968 Abatcha was killed in combat and a battle for succession ensued, in which two candidates were assassinated and a third was forced to escape to Sudan. At the end had emerged victorious Abba Sidick, a moderate left-wing intellectual and former minister of Tombalbaye, who was made in 1970 new secretary-general of the FROLINAT, establishing the headquarters of the organization in Tripoli. In the meanwhile, Abatcha's death did not easy the situation for the government, nor did the formation in 1969 of two separate FROLINAT armies. These were the First Liberation Army of the FROLINAT, or la Premi√®re Arm√©e, a loose coalition of warlords engaged in hit- and-run tactics, that was a faction-ridden force whose groups often fought among themselves and engaged in banditry, active mainly in central Chad; and the Second Liberation Army, or la Deuxi√®me Arm√©e, which operated in the north, and was composed mainly by Toubou. This last force after the death of Mohammed Taher in 1969 came under the control of Goukouni Oueddei. These divisions did not help much the Chadian government; Tombalbaye's authority in the central and northern parts of the country limited itself to a patchwork of urban centers, often connected only by air. This forced the Chadian President to ask in 1968 for French intervention, on the ground of military accords between the two countries. The French President Charles de Gaulle accepted in 1969, starting military intervention on April 14 with Op√©ration Bison.Nolutschungu, p. 93 When Siddick made in 1971 a call for the union of the different groups he was opposed by Goukouni Oueddei and Hiss√®ne Habr√©, who commanded the Second Liberation Army of the FROLINAT, renamed Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (Conseil de Commandement des Forces Arme√©s du Nord or CCFAN) in February 1972. Only the first army of the FROLINAT, operating in eastern and centre-eastern Chad, remained loyal to Siddick. Another armed faction that emerged was the Volcan Army, built by Muhammad Baghlani, a FROLINAT group with an Islamist tendency. In 1969 Chadian President, Fran√ßois Tombalbaye, appealed to France for help. As a result, a French mission arrived with ample powers to reform the army and the civil service and to recommend the abolition of unpopular laws and taxes. Also following their recommendations, the judicial powers of traditional Muslim rulers were restored. Another conciliatory move was the liberation in 1971 of many political prisoners and the formation of a more balanced government, including many more northerners than before. The result of these moves was positive; the insurgents were confined to the Tibesti and the French started retiring their troops, which had played a key role in the years 1969-1971\\\\. Certain to have defeated the FROLINAT, Tombalbaye left the reforms in the summer of 1971 and accused some of the recently freed political prisoners of having attempted a coup d'√©tat with the help of Libya. In reaction Libyan president Muammar al-Gaddafi officially recognized Abba Siddick's FROLINAT, offering him economic and logistic support. The Libyans then began to occupy the Aouzou strip. The manifestations of student rioting in November 1971 caused the destitution of the Chadian Chief of Staff, general Jacques Doumro; his position was occupied by colonel F√©lix Malloum. In 1972 Tombalbaye jailed hundreds of political opponents and to block his enemies initiated a policy of gestures towards Libya and France. Libya reduced its support for Siddick and infighting exploded between the first army of the FROLINAT and Habr√©'s FAN. The first army won assuming control of Ennedi, while the FAN retired to the Borkou and Tibesti. The kidnapping at Barda√Ø of a French archaeologist, Fran√ßoise Claustre, by Habr√©'s forces clouded the relations of the latter with France (April 1974). In June 1973 Tombalbaye jailed his Chief of Staff General Malloum. A political opponent, the liberal Outel Bono, was on the verge of forming a new political party when he was assassinated in Paris and Tombalbaye was accused of the crime. The president lost support within his party, the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT), causing Tombalbaye to replace it with a new one, the National Movement for the Cultural and Social Revolution (MNRCS), and to start an Africanization campaign. The colonial names of some cities were changed with autochthonous names: Fort-Lamy became N'Djamena, Fort-Archambault became Sarh, among others. He himself changed his name from Fran√ßois to Ngarta. An element of this Africanization was the introduction of yondo initiation rites proper of the Sara (his ethnic group) for all those who wanted to obtain positions in the civil service and the army, rites that were seen as anti-Christian. This, with forced \\"voluntary\\" mobilization of the population in agricultural campaigns, mined his support in the south. He also lost the support of the army by arresting many young officers whom he accused of planning a coup: as a result, Tombalbaye was killed and overthrown by a coup on April 13, 1975. He was succeeded by F√©lix Malloum as head of the Supreme Military Council (CSM). The new government included many northerners, but southerners retained a majority. Notwithstanding some popular measures, the government could not satisfy the people's demands. The capital saw new student strikes and the trade unions were suspended. In April 1976 there was an unsuccessful attempt to kill Malloum, and in March 1977 a mutiny by units army in the capital was suppressed by the execution of its ringleaders. After the death of Tombalbaye, FROLINAT had continued its dismemberment. A group active in the east, the FLT, entered in the new government of N'Djamena in July. Oueddei Kichidemi returned from his exile in Libya in the summer of 1975; his son Goukouni Oueddei remained there instead. Habr√© and Goukouni had formed the CCFAN with the design to unite all the northern elements of the FROLINAT under their banner, but now the situation was heavily embroiled by the affair Claustre, which brought France to negotiate directly with the rebels and not sustain Tombalbaye's successor, Malloum, who reacted by asking the 1,500 French troops in Chad to leave the country. Goukouni vs. Habr√© In 1976 and 1977 Libya supported active to the FROLINAT. Faya-Largeau was besieged twice in 1976 and Barda√Ø was conquered in June 1977 by Habr√©. The question of Libyan support caused a rupture between Goukouni and Habr√©, both Toubous but of traditionally opposed clans, whom circumstances had made allies in 1971. Habr√© opposed the Libyan plans of annexation of the Aozou Strip, while Goukouni was against the Claustre kidnapping. In 1976 Habr√©, commanding only a minority of the CCFAN, broke away from the main organization with a few hundred followers and assumed his headquarters in the Batha and Biltine prefectures, founding the Armed Forces of the North (FAN). Goukouni, along with the rest of the forces, kept the name CCFAN and gave the hostages to the French in January 1977. In September 1977 Habr√© started negotiating an alliance with the Malloum and the Military Supreme Council for the formation of a national unity government, that was created in August 1978 with Malloum as president and Habr√© as Prime minister. At the same time Goukouni consolidated his positions in the north, united most of the insurgent formations, including the first army of the FROLINAT and the majority of the CCFAN. All these formations united under the banner of the newly formed People's Armed Forces (FAP), led by Goukouni, who conquered Faya-Largeau in February 1979, assuming control of half the Chadian territory. His advance towards the capital seemed unstoppable, and only the intervention of the French army made it possible to block him at Ati, less than 300 miles north of N'Djamena. In 1979 the national unity government was finished. Habr√© and Malloum confronted each other in the capital and in February Habr√© was left in control, while Chadian Armed Forces (FAT) retired itself towards the south. Shortly before another FROLINAT group was had been formed in January 1978 as the Third Liberation Army of the FROLINAT (later called Popular Movement for the Liberation of Chad, or MPLT), led by Aboubakar Abdel Rahmane, once an ally of Goukouni; this group defeated the government's forces in the west. The First Liberation Army of the FROLINAT reassumed its autonomy, taking control of the eastern prefectures of Ouadda√Ø and Biltine. In the south the Chadian Armed Forces, the former national army, was reorganized by the lieutenant Wadel Abdelkader Kamougu√©, former head of Malloum's gendarmerie, who established in May 1979 the south of the country a government called Permanent Committee. Goukouni took advantage of such a chaotic situation and appeared in N'Djamena before Habr√© had obtained complete control, and took the capital. The GUNT and its failure International moves were made to put an end to the civil war. Nigeria kept in March 1979 at Kano a reconciliation conference. New parties with little or none roots in Chad were formed to be present at this conference, like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Chad (FPLT), headed by Awad Muktar Nasser, a force sustained by Sudan; or the South Front, founded in April 1979, a Muslim group composed of a few dozens of fighters commanded by the Sudanese police sergeant (of Chadian origin) Hadjaro al-Senousi, who boasted to lead an \\"original FROLINAT\\", and to have no less than 3,000 men ready in Sudan. Similar to these was in Sudan a so-called \\"Government in exile of the Islamic republic of Chad\\". But only four forces were at the end invited at Kano I: these were the FAN, the FAP, Malloum for the national government, and, more surprisingly, the small MPLT, supported by Nigeria. On the basis of the Kano Accord a national unity government was formed on April 29, 1979, with Goukouni as Interior minister, Habr√© at the Defence, the general Negue Djogo vice-president (who represented the south, but had broken with Kamougu√©). The president was Lol Mahamat Choua, a proteg√© of Habr√© recommended by Nigeria. Libya protested against these arrangements because they excluded Ahmat Acyl, who had succeeded Baghlani as commander of the Volcan Army after the death of the latter in a flight accident. As a result, Acyl and other pro-Libyan elements formed the Front for Joint Provisional Action (Front d'Action Commune Provisoire or FACP) to oppose the new government (it was renamed a month later Revolutionary Democratic Council). Weeks later, to settle these dissensions, another peace conference was celebrated May in the Nigerian city of Lagos. In summer yet a new government was formed, the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), after a third conference held in July at Lagos which proclaimed Goukouni president, Kamougu√© vice-president and Habr√© Defence minister. As a result, by September the French troops had left almost completely the country. But the cohesion of the GUNT did not much survive their departure: on March 22, 1980, a new battle exploded in N'Djamena among Goukouni and Habr√©'s forces. A few ceasefire were negotiated, but none resisted. In the meanwhile other warlords entered in the fray: Kamougu√© sided with Goukouni, Acyl with Habr√©, leaving the city divided in two with the northern part kept by Goukouni and the southern by Habr√©, who lost now the Defence ministry. The fighting extended to other parts of the country. The forces of Goukouni took Faya- Largeau and cut Habr√©'s supply lines with Sudan. On June 15, 1980, Chad and Libya signed a treaty of mutual defence. In virtue of this agreement the forces of Kamougu√© and Goukouni received tanks, airplanes and other materials, and crushed the forces of Habr√© who fled to Cameroon while his men in the capital and the east of the country were disarmed. In 1981 the governments of Chad and Libya announced their intention to form a single country. But French increasing support for Goukouni prepared what happened on October 29, 1981, when the GUNT's president asked Libyan troops to leave the country. A multi- national contingent of African peace-keepers was to be sent, but only small Nigerian, Senegalese and Zairian forces arrived. Libya's president, Qaddafi, accepted to retire Libyan soldiers in exchange for being chosen for the presidency of the Organisation of African Unity (OUA), and a year was fixed for completing the withdrawal of all the Libyans from Chad. Habr√© ascends to power In the meanwhile, Habr√© was reorganizing his forces in the east with Sudanese help, and had started campaigning taking several cities, and controlled part of the prefectures of Ouadda√Ø and Biltine. In December the FAN, convinced that they could not seize Libyan materials, passed west and seized Oum Hadjer, Ati and Faya-Largeau. The OUA demanded in February 1982, but its request was ignored. By May the GUNT was stationed on the defensive in the capital, when Kamougu√© retired his forces to crush a revolt that had exploded in the south. Habr√© didn't lose this opportunity, and on June 7, 1982, he conquered the capital almost without opposition, while Goukouni escaped to Cameroon. On June 19 Habr√© formed a State Council as new national government, and on October 21 he proclaimed himself President and nominated a new government. Goukouni and his followers regrouped in the north and obtained the support of Libya, which caused Habr√© to reclaim the Aouzou Strip which had been annexed by Libya. On October 28 Goukouni allied eight of the eleven tendencies represented in the GUNT and formed the National Government for Peace in Chad (GNPT) and the Liberation Armed Forces (FAL), both headed by him. The FAL's first goal was to capture Faya-Largeau, which was attacked in January 1983; Habr√© sent his forces to defend the town, but they were defeated on February 20. Notwithstanding this, Faya-Largeau remained in Habr√©'s hands. Goukouni reported some other victories in the north, but in the meanwhile Habr√© was being given abundant help by France and the west to counter the Libyan-supported Goukouni. In March 1983 Chad requested the United Nations the recognition of Chadian sovereignty over the Aozou Strip, and posed the case of the Libyan occupation to the International Court of Justice of The Hague. But the FAL conquered Faya-Largeau on June 25, and with it a third of the country; an attack on the capital appeared imminent, but it never happened, mainly due to France's strong support of Habr√©. Great amounts of modern military equipment were provided to him by France and other western countries, giving him an opening to retake Faya-Largeau on July 30. Libya reacted by launching a massive counter-offensive composed almost entirely of Libyan regular troops. Habr√© suffered a crushing defeat on August 10, losing thousands of soldiers and falling back 200 km to the south. On November 18, 1986 the GUNT was reconstituted under the direction of Habr√© and with participation of Goukouni and Kamougu√©. In 1989 opposition groups to Habr√©'s rule present in Sudan, under the command of Idriss D√©by, formed the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS) and initiated a new phase of the civil war. After conquering Ab√©ch√©, in December 1990 they entered in the capital. Habr√© was forced once again to escape, but a few months later attempted from September 1991 to January 1992 a counter-offensive that proved unsuccessful. Finally a national conference attended by all the parties and guerrilla forces took place between January 15 and April 6, 1993, that culminated with the formation of a High Transitional Council under the presidency of D√©by. The FROLINAT, of which Goukouni was still nominally the head, dissolved itself on January 14, 1993.

De Brevitate Vitae () is a moral essay written by Seneca the Younger, a Roman Stoic philosopher, sometime around the year 49 AD, to his father-in-law Paulinus. The philosopher brings up many Stoic principles on the nature of time, namely that people waste much of it in meaningless pursuits. According to the essay, nature gives people enough time to do what is really important and the individual must allot it properly. In general, time is best used by living in the present moment in pursuit of the intentional, purposeful life. Similar ideas can be found in Seneca's treatise De Otio (On Leisure) and discussion of these themes can often be found in his Letters to Lucilius (letter 49, 101, etc.). Date and addressee The work is addressed to a man called Paulinus--probably Pompeius Paulinus, a knight of Arelate--and is usually dated to around 49 AD. It is clear from chapters 18 and 19 of De Brevitate Vitae that Paulinus was praefectus annonae, the official who superintended the grain supply of Rome, and was, therefore, a man of importance. He was likely a near relative of Seneca's wife, Pompeia Paulina, and quite plausibly her father. He is also thought to be the father of another Pompeius Paulinus, who held high public posts under Nero (Pliny, Nat. Hist. xxxiii. 143; Tacitus, Annals, xiii. 53. 2; xv. 18. 4). As for the date of composition, it must have been after the death of Caligula (41 AD), which Seneca mentions in ¬ß18.5. Furthermore, there are two known periods when Paulinus could have served as praefectus annonae, 48‚Äì55 and 62‚Äì71 AD, and scholars prefer the earlier period. A date of 49 AD has previously been suggested because Seneca writes in ¬ß13.8 \\"that Sulla was the last of the Romans who extended the pomerium\\" (the boundary of Rome). Since Claudius extended this in 49/50 AD, it would have been written before this. However Miriam Griffin has argued that Seneca is quoting a pedant who is asserting that Claudius' extension was illegal, which would mean that Seneca was writing after this date. Griffin has suggested that Seneca wrote De Brevitate Vitae as an excuse for Paulinus to retire early in 55 AD. Contents In chapter 1 Seneca counters the complaint that life is too short with the view that life is long enough if well-managed. Chapters 2 to 9 survey the many ways in which life is squandered and time frittered away by those people (occupati) engrossed in pointless pursuits. Chapters 10 to 17 contrast the philosophical approach to leisure (otium) with the deluded common approach. This culminates in chapters 18 to 20 showing the emancipation of the wise, who can soar above the lives of others mired in endless preoccupation. =Topics= After the introduction (¬ß1), Seneca reviews (¬ß2‚Äì3) the distractions which make life seem short, and explains that people are great wasters of time. He then offers (¬ß4‚Äì6) three examples of famous Romans (Augustus, Cicero and Livius Drusus) who, in various ways, were victims of the engrossed life. He explains (¬ß7‚Äì8) that the engrossed do not know how to live or have awareness, and that they waste time because they do not know its value. One should purposefully live for the moment (¬ß9), because tomorrow will be too late. In contrast (¬ß10) the lives of the engrossed seem so short to them because they are constrained to the fleeting present, and recollect the past in pain. They desperately cling on to life (¬ß11) because they haven't lived, unlike the wise, who are always ready to leave life behind. The engrossed include those who live in leisure and luxury (¬ß12), and Seneca explains (¬ß13) that even those who devote themselves to scholarship are wasting their time if their efforts are directed to no end. Accordingly, (¬ß14‚Äì15) only those who dedicate their time properly truly live, becoming equal with the great minds of the past, allowing the mind of the sage to even transcend time, like a god. The engrossed, on the other hand, (¬ß16‚Äì17) are prey to fidgety and contradictory moods, and their joys and pleasures are bitter with the sense of precariousness. Finally (¬ß18‚Äì19) Seneca exhorts Paulinus to abandon public occupations and adopt the contemplative life of the wise, free from the passions. This is contrasted (¬ß20) with the suffering of the engrossed: they die without having ever lived. Themes In the treatise Seneca argues that we waste so much time because we do not properly value it. We expend great effort in protecting other valuables such as money and property, but because time appears intangible, we allow others to occupy it and take time away from us. Wise people, on the other hand, understand that time is the most valuable of all resources, and with effort can free themselves from external control to engage in meaningful introspection and create an intentional life. Seneca urges his readers to live in the present, and adapt themselves to a purposeful life in agreement with Nature. Only by doing so, can one then truly unlock both past and future. The completeness of each present moment allows one's awareness to expand to the equal of that of the universe, and achieve true virtue and happiness. The statements which urge Paulinus to retire from public life are in notable contrast to Seneca's advice in his De Tranquillitate Animi (to his friend Annaeus Serenus) to seek public employments in order to render life attractive.\\"Seneca as a Moralist and Philosopher\\" in The National quarterly review, p. 18, published 1868 (ed. by E. I. Sears). Retrieved 2017-11-21. However, in his related treatise, De Otio, Seneca makes the point that there is no inconsistency, and that one can serve the greater community in either or both roles.

Versions of it have been broadcast worldwide. The show, in its live form, finished in May 2007, although repeats of past episodes were still broadcast until the closure of the Pokerzone channel the following year. Show Features The show featured coverage of online poker cash games, single table \\"sit and go\\" tournaments, and multi-table tournaments. The games featured are from the Prima Poker network of sites, and are broadcast with a short delay, with all players' cards visible. The presenters also discuss viewers' emails and text messages on poker issues. A regular feature from February, 2006 was the \\"Beat The Presenter\\" tournament, in which one of the presenters plays a single table tournament while the programme is being broadcast, and then analyses their play along with their co-presenter after it is completed. In 2006, Poker Night Live offered its regular online players the chance to win places in a special PokerBowl show. The six qualifiers visited the PokerZone studio to play in a \\"live\\" tournament. The show was broadcast in September 2006 with Ken \\"Snappit\\" Hawkins beating Andrew \\"Gilberto\\" Parkhouse heads up. Presenters & Guests =Presenters= Throughout its run, the show featured a number of different presenters, some of them expert players and others relatively new to the game. Usually the show was presented by one of the female hosts alongside one of the poker experts. When the show started, the hosts knew little about poker, however, their knowledge improved as the show went on. Hosts on the UK version of Poker Night Live included: * Lynsey Horn * Michelle \\"The Night Nurse\\" Orpe * Kara Scott The poker experts on the UK version included: * Mark Banin * Caspar Berry * James Browning * John Clark * Malcolm \\"The Rock\\" Harwood * Alex Hyndman * Tony \\"tikay\\" Kendall * Barry \\"The Bully\\" Martin * \\"Dr Tom\\" Sambrook * Nick Wealthall * Greg \\"Axxeman\\" Winters * Michelle \\"Night Nurse\\" Orpe =Special Guests= Guests in the commentary box have included: * Kevin O'Connell * Victoria Smirnoff * Nic Szeremeta * Antonio Esfandiari * Phil Laak * The Hendon Mob * Dave Ulliott * Johnny Chan * Simon \\"Aces\\" Trumper * Steve Davis =Celebrity Players= Several celebrities have been known to play on the TV broadcast tables, including: * Nick Bateman (Former Big Brother contestant) * Roberto Conte (Former Big Brother contestant) * Charles Ingram (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? million winner, convicted of deception) * Ewen Macintosh (Actor) * Grub Smith (TV presenter) * Phil Taylor (Darts champion) Canadian version In February 2006, a Canadian version was created for Casino and Gaming Television (now called GameTV). The Canadian version ran for two hours, instead of the four-hour run-time of the UK show. The format was similar with more focus on Sit and Go tournaments and No Limit Cash tables featuring Canadian players. The show aired live Wednesday to Sunday at 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. EST. Repeated episodes were aired Monday and Tuesday at 11:00 p.m. and 7 days a week from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. The show was cancelled in December 2006 when CGTV was rebranded to GameTV.

Alcohol tolerance refers to the bodily responses to the functional effects of ethanol in alcoholic beverages. This includes direct tolerance, speed of recovery from insobriety and resistance to the development of alcoholism. Consumption-induced tolerance Alcohol tolerance is increased by regular drinking. This reduced sensitivity requires that higher quantities of alcohol be consumed in order to achieve the same effects as before tolerance was established. Alcohol tolerance may lead to (or be a sign of) alcohol dependency. Heavy alcohol consumption over a period of years can lead to \\"reverse tolerance\\". A liver can be damaged by chronic alcohol use, leading to a buildup of fat and scar tissue. The reduced ability of such a liver to metabolize or break down alcohol means that small amounts can lead to a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and more rapid intoxication. Physiology of alcohol tolerance Alcohol dehydrogenase is a dimeric zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes Direct alcohol tolerance is largely dependent on body size. Large-bodied people will require more alcohol to reach insobriety than lightly built people. Thus men, being larger than women on average, will typically have a higher alcohol tolerance. The alcohol tolerance is also connected with activity of alcohol dehydrogenases (a group of enzymes responsible for the breakdown of alcohol) in the liver, and in the bloodstream. High level of alcohol dehydrogenase activity results in fast transformation of ethanol to more toxic acetaldehyde. Such atypical alcohol dehydrogenase levels are less frequent in alcoholics than in nonalcoholics. Furthermore, among alcoholics, the carriers of this atypical enzyme consume lower ethanol doses, compared to the individuals without the allele. An estimated one out of twenty people have an alcohol flush reaction. It is not in any way an indicator for the drunkenness of an individual. A mild flushing reaction occurs when the body metabolizes alcohol more quickly into acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite. A more severe flushing reaction occurs when the body metabolizes the acetaldehyde more slowly, generally due to an inactive aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme. Both of those conditions‚Äîfaster conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde and slower removal of acetaldehyde‚Äîreduce the risk for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence. Alcohol tolerance in different ethnic groups To engage in alcohol consumption and development of alcoholism appear to be common to primates, and is not a specific human phenomenon. Humans have access to alcohol on far greater quantity than non-human primates, and the availability increased particularly with the development of agriculture. The tolerance to alcohol is not equally distributed throughout the world's population. Genetics of alcohol dehydrogenase indicate resistance has arisen independently in different cultures. In North America, Native Americans have the highest probability of developing alcoholism compared to Europeans and Asians.Mail & al. (eds., 2002): Alcohol Use Among American Indians and Alaska Natives: Multiple Perspectives on a Complex Problem. NIAAA Research Monograph No. 37. Bethesda, MD: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Different alcohol tolerance also exists within Asian groups, such as between Chinese and Koreans. The health benefits of a modest alcohol consumption reported in people of European descent appear not to exist among people of African descent. Higher body masses and the prevalence of high levels of alcohol dehydrogenase in an individual increase alcohol tolerance, and both adult weight and enzymes vary with ethnicity. Not all differences in tolerance can be traced to biochemistry however. Differences in tolerance levels are also influenced by socio-economic and cultural difference including diet, average body weight and patterns of consumption.Saggers, S. & Gray, D. (1998b).

It stars John P. Ryan and Sharon Farrell as a couple whose infant child turns out to be a vicious mutant. The film's cast also includes James Dixon, William Wellman Jr., Shamus Locke, Andrew Duggan, Guy Stockwell, and Michael Ansara. The baby was designed and created by special effects make-up artist Rick Baker, and the film's score was composed by Bernard Herrmann. It's Alive was distributed by Warner Bros. and received mixed reviews upon release. It spawned two sequels, It Lives Again (1978) and It's Alive III: Island of the Alive (1987), as well as a 2009 remake. Plot In Los Angeles, Frank Davis and his wife Lenore are expecting their second child. Frank is a successful public relations consultant and his wife is a stay-at-home mom for their first child, Chris. The couple avoided having a child for several years while Lenore took contraceptive pills. When their child is ready to be born, they leave Chris with a family friend, Charley, and go to the hospital. Their second child, a baby boy, is born monstrously deformed, with fangs and claws. Immediately after birth it kills the doctors and nurses in the delivery room and flees through a skylight. Lenore is left alive, screaming for her child as a horrified Frank discovers the carnage. Frank and Lenore are allowed to leave the hospital while the police, including Lt. Perkins, investigate the killings. Frank and Lenore receive attention from the press, which results in Frank being fired from his job at a public relations company. Meanwhile, the Davis' baby lurks around outdoors, killing several people, including a milkman. As the killings continue, the press and the police hound Frank and Lenore. Frank meets with medical researchers who convince him to sign documents allowing them to experiment on the child's body once it has been found and killed. Frank denies that the child is his son and joins the hunt for the murderous infant. The doctor who prescribed the contraceptive pills to Lenore is contacted by an executive of a pharmaceutical company. The executive acknowledges that the Davis' child's mutation may have been caused by the drugs. He tells the doctor that the child must be destroyed to prevent discovery of the company's liability. Meanwhile, the child makes its way to a school. Frank learns of the child's location and arrives at the school, where police officers are present. Frank informs Lt. Dixon that Chris attends the school. The baby attacks and kills an officer in a classroom before escaping through a window into the night. Later, Frank discovers that Lenore is hiding the infant in the basement of their home. Chris runs away from Charley's house in order to get back home, and Charley drives after him. Lenore pleads with Frank and promises that the baby would not hurt their family. Frank, armed with a gun, enters the basement, where he finds Chris talking to the baby and promising to protect him. Frank shoots at the baby, injuring it. The infant flees the basement and attacks Charley, biting him on the neck and killing him. The police track the infant into the sewers, where Frank hunts him with a rifle. When he finds the baby, he realizes that it is frightened. He apologizes to the child and picks him up. Wrapping the baby in his coat, Frank tries to elude the police, but a mob of armed cops confronts him as he exits the sewers. He pleads for them to study the child, but to not harm him. A fertility doctor shouts at the police to kill him. The child suddenly leaps from Frank's arms and attacks the doctor as the cops open fire, killing both the infant and the doctor. As the Davises are escorted away by the police, Lt. Dixon receives news that another deformed baby has been born in Seattle. Cast Production Special effects make-up artist Rick Baker designed and created the murderous baby depicted in the film. Larry Cohen, who wrote, produced and directed the film, called Baker on the telephone while Baker was at the home of Dick Smith, where he was working on effects for the 1973 film The Exorcist. During that initial phone call, Cohen pitched the concept of the film to Baker, and suggested building a baby suit that could be worn by Cohen's cat, or \\"a chicken or something [...] maybe two chickens!\\" Baker next heard from Cohen two weeks after filming had begun. Cohen had decided to rarely show the infant in the film, and asked Baker to create a \\"dummy baby\\" for the actors to react to. Baker constructed the baby with an aluminum wire armature, allowing for articulated limbs and adjustable eyeballs. For close-up shots, Baker created a full-head mutant infant mask, a pair of gloves, and a partial body suit, which were worn by Baker's then-girlfriend and later wife, Elaine Parkyn. Release The film had a complicated release through Warner Bros. beginning in 1974. Upon completing the film, Cohen found the executives who had backed the production had been replaced and the new executives showed little interest in the project. The studio gave the film a one theater run in April‚ÄîMay 1974 in Chicago. It was then given a limited release beginning October 18, 1974. The film drew respectable business, but the company still did not fully support the project. Three years after its original release, Warner Bros. saw another change in executives and Cohen asked the new group to review the film. It's Alive was reissued in March 1977 with a new advertisement campaign. The updated 1977 TV advertisement features a baby carriage, accompanied by the lullaby \\"Rock-a-bye Baby\\" and a voice-over that says, \\"There's only one thing wrong with the Davis baby. It's alive.\\" The new ad drew people into theaters, ultimately earning Warner Bros. $7.1 million in U.S. domestic rentals. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, It's Alive holds an approval rating of 74% based on 23 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.07/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Tough and unpleasant, It's Alive throttles the viewer with its bizarre mutant baby theatrics.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on six reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. Cohen is not unintelligent, but the few interesting ideas in his horror films, including the recent Demon, are drenched in supreme silliness by way of the dialogue and special effects.\\" A review published in Variety called it a \\"stomach-churning little film,\\" praising Herrmann's \\"highly effective\\" score but criticizing the film's script as being too far-fetched.

Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Attitudes to horror films being what they are, it's a fairly safe bet that John Ryan won't get the credit he so richly deserves for an outstanding performance which brings It's Alive within striking distance of Night of the Living Dead.\\" Leonard Maltin gave It's Alive two-and-a-half out of four stars, commending Herrmann's score but noting that the film is \\"not for all tastes.\\" A review published by TV Guide awarded the film three out of five stars, reading, \\"Part visceral horror flick and part Oedipal allegory, It's Alive explores a widely repressed but crucial element of family life‚Äîparents' ambivalence toward their children‚Äîand satirizes society's cavalier treatment of its youngest members.\\" A review published by Time Out reads, \\"Despite such potentially sidesplitting material, the film often manages to instill a genuinely chilling atmosphere, with its initially kitsch family growing into human beings as they plummet into a world unhinged and apart at the seams.\\" Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews gave It's Alive a grade of \\"A,\\" praising Ryan's performance and calling the film \\"a wacky low-grade entertaining horror pic, one that also has an edge, is discomforting and surprisingly has a good blend of humor and splatter.\\" =Home media= Warner Home Video released It's Alive on VHS and, on October 5, 2004, on DVD. On May 15, 2018, Shout! Factory released a three-disc Blu-ray box set of the It's Alive trilogy. This set contains It's Alive, as well as its sequels It Lives Again and It's Alive III: Island of the Alive. Related works =Novelization= The novelizations of the first film and its sequels expound on the dangers of various prescription drugs administered to expectant mothers during the 1950s and early 1960s (e.g. thalidomide), the use of fertility drugs, and the indirect use of pesticides on people. In the story, the mother of the first mutant child had a history of taking combined oral contraceptive pills prior to planning her second pregnancy, whereupon she instead began taking an inadequately tested fertility drug to facilitate the conception of her second child. =Sequels and remake= It's Alive was followed by two sequels, It Lives Again (1978) and It's Alive III: Island of the Alive (1987).

Endemic to Western Australia, it is native to the floodplains of the Murchison and Gascoyne Rivers. River saltbush is a multi-branched shrub whose form ranges from prostrate to erect. In ideal conditions it may be up to four metres wide, and the erect form may be up to 2.5 metres high. The branches of river saltbush spread along the ground, and may layer and take root, especially in the prostrate form. The leaves are bluish-green and covered in fine silvery hairs. There is great variation in leaf size and shape, but they are often spear-shaped, and usually between one and three centimetres long. Male and female flowers are borne on separate plants. Male flowers are a purplish-green colour, and help in clusters at the ends of branches; female flowers usually cluster in the axils between leaves and stems. The fruit is a woody case about five millimetres square, each containing a single seed. River saltbush is very highly salt tolerant, and is used in Australia in the rehabilitation of saline areas. When grown in saline soil, it has the best long-term survival and growth of any saltbush. It is also fairly drought tolerant, and tolerates waterlogging well once mature. It is highly favoured by sheep, and recovers well from grazing. Studies have shown that the meat of sheep grazed on river saltbush is high in Vitamin E and has high \\"consumer appeal\\". Disadvantages include a low volunteering rate, and difficulties establishing by direct seeding.

The term ectopic expression is predominately used in studies using metazoans, especially in Drosophila melanogaster for research purposes.  How it is useful  Although ectopic expression can be caused by a natural condition, it is uncommonly seen in nature because it is a product of defects in gene regulation. In fact, ectopic expression is more commonly used for research purposes. Artificially induced gene expression helps to determine the function of a gene of interest. Common techniques such as overexpressing or misexpressing the genes by UAS-Gal4 system in D. melanogaster are used. In model organisms, such techniques are used to perform genetic screens to identify a function of the gene involved in specific cellular or developmental processes. Ectopic expression using these techniques is a useful tool because phenotypes induced in a tissue or cell type where are not normally expressed are easily distinguishable compared to a tissue or cell type where the gene is normally expressed. By the comparison with its basal expression, the function of a gene of interest can be identified. Although the understanding of ectopic expressions deals with endogenous genes in an organism, it can be expended to a similar concept like transgenesis, which an exogenous gene is introduced to a cell or tissue type in which the gene is not usually expressed. Practices of ectopic expression in biological science is not only limited to identifying a function of the gene in a known cell or tissue type but also implemented to discover unknown or additional functions of the gene by ectopic expression.  Research examples  = Paired box protein = Paired box protein Pax-6 in humans is a transcription factor, which is a main regulatory gene of eye and brain development. Ectopic expression of Drosophila homolog eyeless (ey) has been used to identify roles of Pax-6 in humans. Using tissue specific UAS-Gal4 system, ey can be induced on the legs, wings, halters and antennae of the transgenic flies to demonstrate that functions of ey. = Olfactory receptor genes = Olfactory receptor gene (OR) is normally expressed in human and mouse olfactory tissue with a main function as odorant receptor for the detection of odorants. Individuals with a defect in this gene have disorders of taste and smell. It has been reported that ORs is also expressed on sperms and testis with special emphasis in a manner of ectopic expression. In a study, researchers identified ectopic expression of OR genes in non-olfactory tissues in the mouse model by measuring transcript levels. Here they found relatively low OR gene expression compared to the olfactory tissue, which result indicates that the OR gene in other tissue have no extra function, but they suggest that there is a possibility that small OR subsets can have functional roles in different tissue. = Synovial Sarcoma X chromosome breakpoint-2 = Synovial Sarcoma X chromosome breakpoint-2 (SSX2) proteins are known to localize in nucleus and work as a transcriptional repressor. In addition, expression of SSX2 is frequently observed in melanoma, but the role of the gene has not been evaluated. Thus, researchers have used the principle of ectopic expression to express SSX2 to different cell lines including cancer model cells. They found important phenotypes of ectopic SSX2 expression that is involved in tumorigenesis: 1) immediate induction of genomic instability, 2) long-term support of tumor cell growth.

Approximately 7,390 Americans of Japanese descent from Western Washington and Alaska were sent to the camp (nearly doubling the town of Puyallup's then-population of 7,500) before being transferred to the War Relocation Authority camps at Minidoka, Idaho, Tule Lake, California and Heart Mountain, Wyoming.Louis Fiset. \\"Puyallup (detention facility),\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 28 Apr 2014). Puyallup Assembly Center, 1942 Camp Harmony was established in May 1942, shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and President Roosevelt's subsequent Executive Order 9066, which authorized the eviction of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. The location for the assembly center was on and around the Western Washington Fairgrounds in Puyallup, Washington. It consisted of four distinct areas: *A, with a population of about 2000, located northeast of the fairgrounds. *B, with a population of about 1200, just east of the fairgrounds in the vicinity of the current Blue parking lot. *C, with a population of about 800, located northwest of the fairgrounds. *D, with a population of about 3000, located on the fairgrounds proper in the area including the racetrack and grandstand, east of the roller coaster. The barracks \\"apartments\\" were designed to allow 50 square feet of space per individual, with one small window, a single electrical socket and a wood stove. Each area contained several mess halls, laundry facilities and latrines. A 100-bed hospital was built in Area D, and existing facilities were used as administration offices and community centers. In May and June 1942, just under 100 Japanese Americans left Camp Harmony to find work or attend school outside the exclusion zone, or to repatriate to Japan. On May 26, 196 men volunteered for an early transfer to Tule Lake to help finish construction on the camp there. The majority of the internees made the 30-hour train trip to Minidoka in 16 groups of approximately 500, beginning on August 12. The last train left the Puyallup station on September 12, and on September 30, 1942 the site was handed over to the Fort Lewis Ninth Service Command. The Puyallup Fairgrounds were then occupied by the U.S. Army 943rd Signal Service Battalion until they were transferred to Fort Lewis, Washington in December. The Puyallup Fairgrounds remained closed to the public until the end of the war, operating as an army training facility. The first postwar fair took place in September 1946. On November 25, 1978, the first Day of Remembrance was held at the Western Washington Fairgrounds, and over 2,000 attended. Five years later, on August 21, 1983, Governor John Spellman and Washington state representatives dedicated a sculpture by George Tsutakawa as a memorial to those confined at the wartime detention site.

The University of La Laguna has 13 University Research Institutes. The University Research Institutes are centers of relevance and activity dedicated to scientific, technical and artistic research. The Canarian Astrophysics Institute and the University Institute of Tropical Diseases and Public Health of the Canary Islands are internationally renowned.  History  Guajara Campus, University of La Laguna Its origins date to the year 1701 when a center for advanced studies was established by the Augustinians in the town of La Laguna. A Papal Bull of 1744 proposed that it be converted into the Ecclesiastical University of San Agust√≠n. In 1792, by royal decree, Charles IV of Spain ordered the establishment in San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna, then the capital of Tenerife and Canary Islands, of the first Universidad Literaria of the Canaries, but the political situation on the mainland prevented its establishment. However, with the restoration of the House of Bourbon in the guise of Fernando VII of Spain, the university was established at La Laguna as the Universidad de San Fernando. In this role it played an important role the priest Crist√≥bal Bencomo y Rodr√≠guez, confessor of King Ferdinand VIIObispos canarios. P√°gina web oficial de la Di√≥cesis de Canarias and Titular Archbishop of Heraclea.Obispos canarios. P√°gina web oficial de la Di√≥cesis de Canarias The university, with its current name, was created with the same decree that divided the Canary Islands into two provinces in 1927, and reorganized in 1989, which led to the creation of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.  Units  Split their units in the cities of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna and Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Moreover, its activity includes university curricula such as the University's environmental La Palma, the Summer University of Lanzarote, the Summer University of La Gomera, the Summer University of Adeje (Tenerife), Classrooms El Hierro Sea, and university extension courses, in some municipalities of Tenerife and other islands.  Traditions  One of the most popular student traditions at La Laguna University is the popular Fuga de San Diego every November 13. Although born in the IES Canarias Cabrera Pinto of the city, it has a great following among the students of the University of La Laguna, as well as in the other educational centers of the Canary archipelago. This tradition had its origin in 1919, when university professor Diego Jim√©nez de Cisneros arrived at the institute, which one year prevented the students from attending the romer√≠a of St. Didacus of Alcal√°. But the students did not attend a class, and this was repeated annually. This tradition consists, therefore, in the non-attendance of students to class that day. At present, this tradition has extended to the different schools, universities and secondary institutes of the rest of the Canary Islands.

Adenotrophic viviparity differs from ovoviviparity in that the eggs (usually one at a time) are retained within the female's body, hatch and are nourished through \\"milk glands\\" until the developed larvae are ready to pupate. The larvae are then 'larviposited' and immediately pupate. This is one way insects avoid predation during their most vulnerable life stage. In ovoviviparity one or more egg hatches internally in the female, but they are not nourished after hatching and are immediately 'larviposited' and continue their development outside the female.

Overview =Returning to live performances= In 1973, Gaye released his greatest-selling album, Let's Get It On, which made him the biggest-selling Motown artist during his lifetime. Motown Records, Gaye's label for over a decade, had long wanted Gaye to promote his recordings with a national tour but the rebellious singer, who had begun suffering from stage fright after the collapse of his beloved singing duet partner Tammi Terrell in October 1967 and whom later died of a brain tumor two and a half years later in March 1970, had refused to return to live performing only agreeing to do it only at sporadic times including when he was honored in his hometown in Washington, D.C. in May 1972 and performed at the Kennedy Center and briefly on the 1973 film, Save the Children. But with the success of Let's Get It On and Gaye's now-increasing spending habit, he reluctantly agreed to start touring again in the beginning of 1974. After rescheduling the concert for January 4, 1974, at the Oakland Coliseum Arena, Gaye took the stage in front of 14,000-plus screaming fans. He performed a new song which he dedicated to his girlfriend Janis Hunter titled \\"Jan\\" and performed most of his 1970s repertoire, only including his 1960s classics in a sped-up \\"Fossil Medley\\". Throughout his tours, Gaye began developing performance anxiety and had feared the public reception. To test the public, he reportedly forced his younger brother Frankie to come out before being confident enough to come out afterwards. The biggest fan response on the album came when Gaye retooled his song, \\"Distant Lover\\", into a slower-paced version starting the song out as he segued from \\"Theme from Trouble Man\\" (seventh track from his Trouble Man album) to the song itself producing female shrieks, which kept up as Gaye continued his show-stopping performance of the song. The performance soon became a Gaye trademark onstage and the singer continued to perform the song in that similar style until his final performances in the 1980s. =Reception= Commercially, the album was a big success and proved that, despite his fears, Gaye was still as convincing as a live performer as he was as a recording artist during the early-1970s. On August 31, 1974, the album peaked at #1 on the R&B; album chart for two weeks while resting at #8 on the pop album chart. The live version of \\"Distant Lover\\" created such a frenetic response that Motown issued the live song as a single where it reached #28 on the pop chart and #15 on the R&B; charts in the late summer of 1974. The album would go on to sell over a million copies. The live album earned Gaye his fifth Grammy Award nomination for Best Male R&B; Vocal Performance at the 17th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to \\"Boogie on Reggae Woman\\" by fellow Motown artist and close friend Stevie Wonder.

Character history The alien being who would become Sparta was a native of the war-torn planet of Synriannaq. According to her own claims, she was about to be killed only seconds after being born. Other than that, virtually none of her past history is known, she was one of twelve children who were saved from certain death and assembled by the Titan goddess, Rhea to be reared as the eventual saviors and successors of the Titans of Myth. Called the Titan Seeds by Rhea and brought to the moon of New Chronus, Sparta and the other children were granted superhuman powers, trained as warriors, and educated in various arts and sciences. During this time, Sparta and her fellow Seed, Athyns of Karrakan became lovers, however that came to an end when the Seeds all reached the age of 13 and were sent back to their own homeworlds after their training was complete. All of them were given false memories by the Titan of Memory, Mnemosyne, so that they could learn the ways of their respective cultures, and to teach them humility. Once the Seeds reached adulthood, they would return to New Chronus to take their rightful places alongside the Titans of Myth. This was not to be in Sparta's case however, as she alone retained all her memories of her time on New Chronus. Although she first used her powers to protect the planet and its populace, the memories of her time on New Cronus with the Titans and her fellow Seeds eventually drove her to madness, leading Sparta to conquer Synriannaq and declare war on the other Seeds, destroying them and stealing their powers for herself and in the process, severely aged and weakened the Titans of Myth. Phoebe, The Goddess of the Moon traveled to Earth in search of one of the Seeds, but she had only an ancient picture of the Seed in question as her only clue. When Phoebe arrived on Earth, pursued by Sparta's assassins, she at first mistook Wonder Woman for the Seed, due to their stunning similarities to each other, but quickly realized she was not the one. Near death from expending so much of her power, Phoebe finally located the Seed, who turned out to be Donna Troy, who was a member of the Teen Titans under the name of Wonder Girl. The Titans were under attack by Sparta's assassins and were on the verge of being overwhelmed when Phoebe arrived and destroyed them. However the strain of her advanced age and depleted powers finally caught up with Phoebe and she eventually died, but not before revealing some of Donna's past to her. Donna and the Titans arrived on New Chronus where the Titans of Myth bade them to find the two remaining Seeds that Sparta had not slain‚ÄîAthyns and Xanthi of Ozyron. After helping Athyns to regain his memories of his time on New Chronus, Xanthi was killed by Sparta and Athyns vowed revenge, but was torn by his still evident love for her. Eventually both Donna and Athyns, aided by the Titans were able to return the powers of the slain Seeds to the Titans of Myth, restoring them to full power, but in the process, Sparta was reduced to a mindless husk. To honor Xanthi's memory, Athyns became the new protector of Ozyron. The Titans of Myth took Sparta with them when they left, feeling that she was their responsibility, and Donna returned to Earth with her friends the Titans.The New Titans #50-54 (December 1988-March 1989) Sparta's return Years later when Donna was slain by a Superman android and reborn on New Chronus with false memories as the Goddess of the Moon and wife of Coeus implanted in her mind by the Titans of Myth, Sparta appeared once again. While she had indeed been restored to her full mental health, she had been stripped of most of her original powers and was serving as a general in the Titans of Myth's royal army. The army consisted of other alien races whom the Titans of Myth had goaded into warring against each other in order to further their own power-mad ambitions. When the Titans of Myth attempted to lay siege to the planet Minosyss, they sacrificed Sparta's life in combat, but unknown to them, the act began to trigger the restoration of Donna's true memories. Athyns, who was also serving the Titans of Myth, aided The Teen Titans and The Outsiders, who had come in search of Donna, in defeating the Titans of Myth. They were later banished into Tartarus by Troia.DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy #1-4 Powers and abilities As one of the Titan Seeds, Sparta possessed considerable power, but after destroying most of the other Seeds, and adding their power to her own, they increased exponentially. The full range of what she was capable of remains unknown, but the most typical power she was seen displaying was the manipulation and projection of tremendously powerful energy blasts. She also possessed some minor psionic disciplines, as well as the power of flight. Like the other Seeds, Sparta was also trained in various forms of combat, but usually relied on her energy powers to battle her enemies.

He was largely responsible for making the prima donna a fixture of blackface minstrelsy.  Biography  Leon was trained as a boy soprano by Rev. Dr. Cummings in Fordham, NY. He performed the first soprano part in Mozart's Twelfth Mass at St. Stephen's church in New York City at age 8. Leon entered minstrelsy in 1858. Only 14 at the time, he quickly rose to fame by specializing in portraying female prima donna characters, mulatto coquettes in yellow makeup and elaborate costumes. Leon's 300 dresses (which he refused to call \\"costumes\\") were a key piece of his act, and some cost as much as $400.Toll 144. He came to refer to himself as simply \\"Leon\\" or \\"The Only Leon\\". His influence was such that by 1873, every major minstrel troupe had its own Leon imitator. In 1882, he earned more than any other minstrel performer.Toll 142. The press loved him. In 1870, The Clipper raved, \\"Leon is the best male female actor known to the stage. He does it with such dignity, modesty, and refinement that it is truly art.\\"New York Clipper. Quoted in Toll 142. In fact, Leon's impersonation was so convincing that a reviewer in Rochester, New York remarked, \\"Heaps of boys in my locality don't believe yet it's a man in spite of my saying it was\\", and that Leon could \\"make a fool of a man if he wasn't sure.\\" Another critic raved, \\"He is more womanly in his by-play and mannerisms than the most charming female imaginable.\\" The idea that a male performer represented women better than women was echoed by another critic who noted, \\"Just as a white man makes the best stage Negro, so a man gives more photographic interpretation of femininity than the average woman is able to give\\".Slide, Anthony. The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville. University Press of Mississippi, 2012: 172. In 1864, Leon formed a minstrel troupe with Edwin Kelly. Leon and Kelly's Minstrels spoke of their freedom from vulgarity and featured elaborate scenery and refined operas with Leon as the female lead. Though these were at heart burlesques, Leon insisted that everything was quite proper. He claimed to have studied ballet from a respected dancer and to have practiced for \\"hours every day\\" for seven years. He further asserted that he took voice lessons from famous opera teacher Errani. Ultimately, however, Leon's performances were not enough to keep the company afloat. By 1883, Leon had joined the San Francisco Minstrels.

After attending Yale for two years studying law, Grigsby returned to Norfolk to practice, but his growing deafness caused him to turn to journalism. For six years he was owner and editor of the Norfolk American Beacon. He represented Norfolk in the legislature 1829‚Äì1830, and became a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829‚Äì1830 along with, James Madison, and other noted men.Guide to the Grigsby Papers In 1840, Grigsby married Mary Venable Carrington, the daughter of Colonel Clement Carrington of \\"Edgehill\\" plantation, Charlotte County, Virginia. Except for short period in Norfolk, Grigsby remained at Edgehill the rest of his life, modernizing agricultural methods and managing a profitable enterprise. Grigsby had a great passion for books and classical art. He eventually acquired over 6,000 volumes in his lifetime, and augmented his own collection with volumes purchased from the library of John Randolph of Roanoke, who was a delegate from Charlotte County in the Virginia Convention of 1829‚Äì30 they had attended together. He supported Virginia sculptor Alexander Galt, and owned his \\"Columbus\\", \\"Sappho\\", \\"Psyche\\", and \\"Bacchante\\". Career at the College The College of William and Mary Wren Building with Italianate towers, c. 1859 Grigsby, a descendant of the College's first colonial President John Blair, received his Doctorate of Laws from the College in 1855. In 1859, following a fire that consumed the library, headed the list of donors for a vested library fund with a contribution of $1000.College of William and Mary 2010, p. 166. 69 One thousand dollars as an economic project cost in 1859 dollars is $4 million in 2016 dollars.Measuring Worth Following the Civil War, Grigsby on the Board of Visitors along with former Governor Henry A. Wise supported College President Benjamin Ewell in reinvesting the College's remaining endowment funds in Williamsburg's heritage site rather than relocating to Richmond. An elementary preparatory school was established with funds from a colonial fund dating to 1741, awarded by the English Court of Chancery in September 1866. Faculty size was reduced and the Brafferton building was used for most classes, along with the President's House as a science laboratory.Heuvel 2013, pp. 138‚Äì139 In 1870, Grigsby, who had been active at the College of William and Mary on its Board of Visitors since the 1850s, was elected as President of the Virginia Historical Society. The following year he was elected chancellor of the College following former President John Tyler, and Grigsby served both posts as President of the VHS and Chancellor of W&M; until 1881. Grigsby was an authority on the history of Virginia, and William and Mary had given him the degree of Doctor of Laws (LL. D) in 1855. He contributed to the Southern Literary Messenger, and wrote numerous historical discourses, including one on the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829‚Äì1830 delivered before the historical society in 1853, another on that of 1776 delivered at William and Mary in 1855, and \\"Discourse on Hon.

The Airflow was the first full-size American production car to use streamlining as a basis for building a sleeker automobile, one less susceptible to air resistance. Chrysler made a significant effort at a fundamental change in automotive design with the Chrysler Airflow, but it was ultimately a commercial failure. Chrysler also marketed a companion model under the DeSoto brand, the DeSoto Airflow. Genesis of the Airflow project Front view of a restored '34 Airflow. doors open. Note rear suicide door. Side view of a '34 Airflow showing open hood cooling vents. Rear view of a '34 Airflow. Note spare tire mount. Interior of a '34 Airflow. Carl Breer, along with fellow Chrysler engineers Fred Zeder and Owen Skelton, began a series of wind tunnel tests, with the cooperation of Orville Wright, to study which forms were the most efficient shape created by nature that could suit an automobile. Chrysler built a wind tunnel at the Highland Park site, and tested at least 50 scale models by April 1930. Their engineers found that then- current two-box automobile design was so aerodynamically inefficient, that it was actually more efficient turned around backwards. Applying what they had learned about shape, the engineers also began looking into unibody construction to achieve rigidity with less weight than could be achieved with the conventional separate frame and body. The strengthening was demonstrated in a publicity reel. The car thus represented a breakthrough in lightweight- yet-strong construction as well as increasing the power-to-drag ratio as the lighter, more streamlined body allowed air to flow around it instead of being caught against upright forms such as radiator grilles, headlights and windshields. Traditional automobiles of the day were the typical two-box design, with about 65% of the weight over the rear wheels. When loaded with passengers, the weight distribution tended to become further imbalanced, rising to 75% or more over the rear wheels, resulting in unsafe handling characteristics on slippery roads. Spring rates in the rear of traditional vehicles were, therefore, necessarily higher, and passengers were subjected to a harsher ride. Innovative weight distribution on the new Chrysler Airflow stemmed from the need for superior handling dynamics. The engine was moved forward over the front wheels compared with traditional automobiles of the time, and passengers were all moved forward so that rear seat passengers were seated within the wheelbase, rather than on top of the rear axle. The weight distribution had approximately 54% of the weight over the front wheels, which evened to near 50‚Äì50 with passengers, and resulted in more equal spring rates, better handling, and far superior ride quality. The Airflow debuts Prior to the Airflow's debut, Chrysler did a publicity stunt in which they reversed the axles and steering gear of a conventional 1933 model, which allowed the car to be driven \\"backwards\\" throughout Detroit. The stunt caused a near panic, but the marketing department felt that this would call attention to the poor aerodynamics of current cars, and send a hint that Chrysler was planning something big. The car that emerged was like no other American production car to date. The Airflow, which was heavily influenced by the streamlining design movement, was sleek and low compared to other cars on American roads. The car's grille work cascaded forward and downward forming a waterfall look where other makes featured fairly upright radiators. Headlights were semi-flush to areas immediate to the grille. The front fenders enclosed the running surface of the tire tread. In the rear, Airflows encased the rear wheels through the use of fender skirts. Instead of a flat panel of glass, the windshield comprised two sheets of glass that formed a raked \\"vee\\" both side to side, and top to bottom. All the windows were made of safety glass.http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chrysler_and_Imperial/1934_Chrysler/1934_Chrysler_Imperial_%20Airflow_Limo_Brochure/1934%20Chrysler%20Imperial%20Airflow%20Limo-06.html Passengers were carried in a full steel body (at a time when automakers like General Motors, Ford and even Chrysler itself continued to use wood structural framing members in their car bodies) that rested between the wheels instead of upon them. The front seat was wider than in other cars and the rear seat was deeper. Overall, the car possessed a better power-to-weight ratio, and its structural integrity was stronger than other like models of the day. The car was introduced months (in January, 1934) before it was put in production, and production peaked at only 6,212 units in May 1934 ‚Äî very late in the year and barely enough to give every dealer a single Chrysler Airflow. The factory had not accounted for significant manufacturing challenges and expense due to the unusual new Airflow design, which required an unprecedented number and variety of welding techniques. The early Airflows arriving at dealerships suffered from significant problems, mostly the result of faulty manufacturing. According to Fred Breer, son of Chrysler Engineer Carl Breer, the first 2,000 to 3,000 Airflows to leave the factory had major defects, including engines breaking loose from their mountings at . =1934= For 1934, both Chrysler and its junior running mate, DeSoto, were scheduled to offer the Airflow. DeSoto was assigned to offer nothing but Airflows; Chrysler, however, hedged its bets and continued to offer a six-cylinder variant of its more mainstream 1933 model cars. The Airflow used a flathead I8 engine and was produced in both 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan variants. Chrysler of Canada produced an Airflow Six, model CY, which was basically a DeSoto Airflow with a Chrysler grille, bumpers, instrument panel and emblems. A total of 445 were built. The Airflow Six was dropped at the end of 1934. The appearance was also used for commercial trucks as the Dodge Airflow. The Chrysler line of eight-cylinder Airflows included model CU Airflow Eight ( wheelbase), model CV Airflow Imperial Eight ( wheelbase), model CX Airflow Custom Imperial ( wheelbase). At the very top was the model CW Airflow Custom Imperial with a body built by LeBaron on a wheelbase. The CW had the industry's first one-piece curved windshield on a production automobile. Within six months of the Airflow's introduction, the vehicle was a sales disaster. Adding insult to injury, General Motors mounted an advertising campaign aimed at further discrediting the Airflows. Most automotive historians, though, agree that the Airflow was shunned in large part because buyers did not like its looks. The hood, waterfall grille, headlamps, and fenders were all merged into one continuous form that was interpreted as an \\"anonymous lump\\". While thoroughly modern, the public was slow to embrace the Airflow. At the depth of the Great Depression, the car seemed to be too advanced, too different for many consumers. While Airflows sold in respectable numbers in its first year, Chrysler's traditional sedans and coupes far outsold the Airflow by 2.5 to one, with first year Airflow sales at 10,839 units. DeSoto fared far worse than Chrysler for 1934. Without any \\"standard\\" car to sell, DeSoto's sales numbers plunged. And while the Airflow design looked somewhat sleek on the Chrysler's longer wheelbase, the DeSoto appeared to be short and stubby. Rumors also persisted that the \\"new-fangled\\" body was unsafe, which was mostly untrue. In one widely distributed advertising film shown in movie theatres, an empty Airflow was pushed off a Pennsylvania cliff, falling over ; once righted, the car was driven off, battered, but recognizable. =1935= Stung by the lack of consumer interest in the car, Chrysler responded by making modifications to the body that brought the front of the car more in line with public taste. Foremost of 1935 changes was the placement of a slightly peaked grille that replaced the waterfall unit of 1934. The Airflow models offered for 1935 were the same as in 1934, with the exception of the Airflow Eight two-door sedan, which was dropped. Chrysler Airflow production dipped below 8,000 units for 1935, with roughly four Airstreams produced for every Airflow. =1936= For 1936, the Airflow surrendered its smooth backside when a trunk was tacked onto the body of the car. The grille also became more pronounced. Only one Airflow body style, the four-door Imperial sedan (C-10) broke the 1,000 unit mark with 4,259 units built. Otherwise, total Airflow production sank to 6,275 units compared to the concurrent Airstream models, which sold more than 52,000 units for 1936. 1936 would be the last year that Chrysler's premium Imperial model range would carry the Airflow. Lifeguard tires were introduced, which had two tubes inside the tire. =1937= 1937 Chrysler Airflow In its final year, the Airflow was reduced to one model, the Airflow Eight, offered as a two-door coupe and four-door sedan. A total of 4,600 units were produced before the program was cancelled. Flat dashboards with recessed controls, soft door handles, and padding on the back of the front seats were new safety features. It was in this year that an Airflow Custom Imperial, model CW*, limousine became the official car of Philippine president Manuel L. Quezon. The historic vehicle was restored in 1978 and is on display in Quezon City, Philippines Another major restoration was conducted in 2009 by Alfred Nobel Perez of the Vintage Car Club of the Philippines in time for the 131st birth anniversary of Quezon. It was first displayed at Do√±a Aurora Quezon replica house corner of San Luis and Rizal Streets, Poblacion, Baler, Aurora, Philippines. It later became part of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines collection for its Presidential Car Museum inaugurated on August 19, 2018 in partnership with the Quezon City government. Another 1937 Airflow Custom Imperial, model CW*, limousine was owned by radio personality Major Edward Bowes, Chrysler was one of Bowes' radio show sponsors. The two Airflow Custom Imperials were actually leftover 1935 models and only the two were built for 1937; Imperials and Custom Imperials built for the U.S. market in 1937 were conventionally styled, and priced below and above the Airflow, respectively. The cars have a 140-inch wheelbase. After effects Toyota AA, 1936. Influenced by the Chrysler Airflow via DeSoto Airflow. Volvo PV 36 Carioca While the Airflow may have signaled Chrysler's attempt to set itself apart from other manufacturers, the failure of the car in the marketplace caused the company to take a more conservative path with its future models. Until the debut of Virgil Exner's \\"Forward Look\\" cars of 1955, Chrysler's corporate styling was conservative and mainstream. It is rumoured that Ferdinand Porsche imported an early Airflow coupe into Germany, and using this model for \\"inspiration\\", designed the first Volkswagen Beetle. The similarities between early Volkswagen Beetles and the Airflow coupes could be a testimony to this hypothesis.. However, the general lines of the KDF-Wagen were drawn as early as 1932, and the Czech Tatra T97 and the Tatra 77 are far more likely inspirations. Regardless of any effect it may or may not have had with Dr. Porsche, the revolutionary benefits of the design were immediately evident to designers the world over. U.S. designers could not and did not ignore the benefits of all steel construction, aerodynamics and a rear seat forward of the rear axle. General Motors was quick to respond with all-steel \\" Turret Tops\\", and other manufacturers either followed suit or went out of business. In other countries, where gasoline was more expensive and practical considerations were therefore more important than styling, the flattery-by- imitation was even more sincere. Volvo was one of the first to get a smaller copy of the Airflow into production. The Peugeot 202 would become a major sales success (to Chrysler's chagrin), and imitating the Airflow would be the secret of the success of a brand-new venture in the auto business called Toyota. =Art= The Airflow was the inspiration for Claes Oldenburg's print/sculpture Profile Airflow, featuring a lithograph of the car beneath a superimposed aquamarine resin relief. The initial resin in the initial printing faded to an olive green colour and was thus recalled by Claes Oldenburg and Gemini G.E.L., the printmaking studio which fabricated Profile Airflow. Profile Airflow is especially significant because it revolutionized the idea of a print, expanding it to include serialized sculpture. =Styling Legacy= After nearly a century, Chrysler created the Chrysler PT Cruiser which was a retro-style car with its styling having mixed elements from the 1949 Chevrolet Suburban and the Chrysler Airflow.

The project also supplies water to the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge, and the Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge. The project was one of the first to be developed by the Reclamation Service, which later became the Bureau of Reclamation. The two main sources supply water for the project are Upper Klamath Lake and the Klamath River. The main bodies of water in the Klamath Project are Clear Lake Reservoir, Klamath River, Link River, Lost River, Lower Klamath Lake, Tule Lake, and Upper Klamath Lake. The project fills these reservoirs from the spring runoff, peaking generally in March and April, and keeps the runoff from flooding the historical marshes that are a large portion of the present farmland. There are also many minor streams in the area. Lost River historically drained into Tule Lake, an endorheic lake. The project now diverts excess Lost River water to the Klamath River, allowing portions of Tule Lake to be reclaimed. Map of Klamath Project Some of rangeland have been transformed into active farmland through the Klamath Project. Of that total, were recovered by draining a portion of Lower Klamath Lake, a shallow marsh straddling the Oregon- California border between the California towns of Dorris and Tulelake. Tule Lake was also reduced in size by diverting water from Lost River to the Klamath River. Farmers in the project raise barley, alfalfa hay, and other hay, oats, potatoes, and wheat. The Klamath Basin is on the Pacific Flyway and the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges Complex is visited by migratory game birds every year. The project should not be confused with the Klamath River Hydroelectric Project, a set of hydro dams on the mainstem of the Klamath operated by for-profit energy company PacifiCorp. The Link River Dam belongs to both. History Klamath Project main canal, as depicted in the 1908 Report of the Oregon Conservation Commission. Construction began on the project in 1906 with the building of the main \\"A\\" Canal. Water was first made available May 22, 1907. The Clear Lake Dam was completed in 1910, the Lost River Diversion Dam and many of the distribution structures in 1912, and the Anderson-Rose Diversion Dam (formally Lower Lost River Diversion Dam) in 1921. The Malone Diversion Dam on Lost River was built in 1923 to divert water to Langell Valley. A contract executed February 24, 1917, between the California- Oregon Power Company (now Pacific Power) and the United States authorized the company to construct the Link River Dam for the benefit of the project and for the company's use, and in particular extended to the water users of the Klamath Project certain preferential power rates. The dam was completed in 1921. In more recent times, the Klamath Project has been the focus of nationwide controversy. The Lost River and Shortnose suckers were listed as endangered in 1988. This, as well as concerns for salmon runs, led to a cutoff of irrigation water to local farmers on April 6, 2001. After many protests by farmers and concerned citizens alike, the decision was reversed the next year. The impact of the salmon kill was detailed in the book Salmon is Everything. A 2002 report by the National Research Council however, determined that the decision to stop delivery of irrigation water in 2001 was not scientifically justified and that the 2002 fish kill was caused by a combination of natural factors. A massive die off of salmon occurred in 2002 due to low water and high temperatures in the lower reaches of the river during the salmon migration. Studies showed that drought conditions and low flow from the entire drainage were among the factors that caused a unique mix of conditions to allow a gill rot disease to attack the salmon population.http://klamathwaterlib.oit.edu/cgi- bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/kwl&CISOPTR;=481 The conflict in balancing the economic and ecological concerns of the region was the focus of the 2006 book River of Renewal: Myth and History in the Klamath Basin. Today, there is still much antagonism between opposing sides on this issue. Engineering =Dams= Lost River Diversion Dam, completed 1912 The Klamath Project contains seven dams, all of them on tributaries of the Klamath River itself. In chronological order of completion, they are: * the Clear Lake Dam, completed in 1910, replaced 2002, for flood control and water storage. It impounds Lost River to form Clear Lake Reservoir * the Lost River Diversion Dam, completed in 1912, diverts the waters of the Lost River into the Klamath, thereby controlling flow into the adjacent Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge and reclaimed parts of the Tule Lake bed * the Link River Dam, completed in 1921 for flood control, water storage, and hydro power. It impounds Link River to form Upper Klamath Lake * the Anderson-Rose Diversion Dam, completed in 1921 as a diversion dam, on the Lost River close to Merrill, Oregon * the Malone Diversion Dam, finished in 1923, on the upper Lost River * the Miller Diversion Dam, completed in 1924, on Miller Creek, below Gerber Dam * the Gerber Dam, completed in 1925 for water storage, impounding Miller Creek to form Gerber Reservoir =Canals= There are over of canals, laterals and diversion channels in the Klamath Project. The canals transport irrigation water from Klamath Lake and the Klamath River, Clear Lake and the Lost River, and Tule Lake. There are two tunnels: the \\"A\\" Canal (the main canal that starts just above the Link River Dam) has an underground section as it flows through Klamath Falls, and the Tule Lake Tunnel. There are almost of drainage canals in the Klamath Project which allow land that would otherwise be wetlands to be farmed. The Lower Klamath Lake was before it was drained and would naturally evaporate about each summer. This is roughly equivalent to the annual delivery of the A canal. =Pumps= There are 28 pumping stations in the Klamath Project. These pumps have a total output of over 1937 ft¬≥/s (55 m¬≥/s).  Water management  As opposed to the government-owned irrigation dams of the Klamath Project on upper tributaries, the seven dams of the Klamath River Hydroelectric Project are operated by for-profit energy company PacifiCorp. The systems share one facility, the Link River Dam, which is owned by the United States Bureau of Reclamation but operated by PacifiCorp primarily to regulate its own downstream water supply, and secondarily for power generation. Controversies over water management since 2001 have involved the entire river. That year, a court order withheld irrigation water from Klamath Project farmers, to comply with mandated river levels for the threatened Coho salmon and the endangered Lost River Sucker.\\"Water Conflicts and Crises,\\" The Oregon Story, Oregon Public Broadcasting. Downstream populations of Coho salmon are within the Southern Oregon/Northern California Evolutionary Significant Unit and are listed as threatened (2011). The 2010 Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) is a multi-party legal agreement determining river usage and water rights involving the Klamath River, the Klamath Project, and the Klamath Basin, within the states of California and Oregon. Among the more notable signatories to the agreement were the Governors of California and Oregon, and the Chairman of the Klamath Tribes. ;Goals The Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement aims to: * assist restoration of Riparian zones along many of the rivers in the Klamath Basin * remove four downstream hydro power dams on the Klamath River operated by PacifiCorp by 2020, with the goal of salmon restoration * provide irrigation water assurances for Klamath Basin farmers * provide the Klamath Tribes with the 90,000 acre Mazama Tree Farm  References   External links  * United States Bureau of Reclamation * Klamath Waters Digital Library Category:Klamath River Category:Interbasin transfer Category:United States Bureau of Reclamation Category:Water in Oregon Category:Water in California Category:Klamath County, Oregon Category:History of Modoc County, California Category:History of Siskiyou County, California Category:Hydroelectric power plants in Oregon Category:Klamath Mountains Category:Geography of Klamath County, Oregon Category:Geography of Modoc County, California Category:Geography of Siskiyou County, California ","title":"Klamath Project"},{"id":"2991008","text":"Justine Clark is an architectural editor, writer, speaker and researcher, based in Melbourne, Australia.

It has an international octal base (indicated by the '3' in the part number) and is found mainly in the final output stages of audio amplification circuits; it was also designed to be suitable as a series regulator by virtue of its high permissible voltage between heater and cathode and other parameters. The American RETMA tube designation number for this tube is 6CA7. The USSR analog was 6P27S (Cyrillic: 6–ü27C). Specifications In common with all 'E' prefix tubes, using the Mullard‚ÄìPhilips tube designation, the EL34 has a heater voltage of 6.3 V. According to the data sheets found in old vacuum tube reference manuals, a pair of EL34s with 800 V plate voltage can produce 90 watts output in class AB1 in push‚Äìpull configuration. However, this configuration is rarely found. One application of this type was in \\"Australian Sound\\" public address amplifiers commonly used in government schools in Australia in the 1950s, using four EL34s for ‚âà200 watts. More commonly found is a pair of EL34s running class AB1 in push‚Äìpull around 375‚Äì450 V plate voltage and producing 50 watts output (if fixed bias is used), while a quad of EL34s running class AB1 in push‚Äìpull typically run anywhere from 425 to 500 V plate voltage and produces 100 watts output. This configuration is typically found in guitar amplifiers. Current production JJ E34L, blue glass edition The EL34 is a pentode, while the 6L6, which delivers a similar range of power output, is a beam tetrode which RCA referred to as a beam power tube. Although power pentodes and beam tetrodes have some differences in their principles of operation (the beam forming plates of the beam tetrode or fifth electrode (3rd grid) of the pentode, both serving to hinder the return of unabsorbed electrons from the anode (or plate) to the 4th electrode (2nd grid)) and have some internal construction differences, they are functionally closely equivalent. Unlike the 6L6, (EIA base 7AC) the EL34 has its grid 3 connection brought out to a separate Pin (Pin 1) (EIA base 8ET) and its heater draws 1.5 Amps compared to the 0.9 Amp heater in the 6L6. However, Sylvania (and possibly GE) marketed a tube as 6CA7 which was not only in a markedly different 'fat boy' envelope, but used a beam forming plate much like a 6L6. Examining the mica spacer on the top of the tube will confirm the lack of a suppressor grid. Although these tubes have similar (but not identical) characteristics, they are made very differently. Matched EL34 vacuum tubes by Russian manufacturer Svetlana The EL34 was introduced in 1949 by Philips, the parent company of Mullard. Although no longer made by them, it is manufactured by JJ Electronic, Shuguang, Svetlana and Reflector (Sovtek, Electro-Harmonix, Tung-Sol and other brands), amongst others. Some firms make a related tube called an E34L which is rated to require a higher grid bias voltage, but which may be interchangeable in some equipment. Application The EL34 was widely used in higher-powered audio amplifiers of the 1960s and 1970s, such as the popular Dynaco Stereo 70 and the Leak TL25 (mono) and Stereo 60, and is also widely used in high-end guitar amplifiers because it is characterized by greater distortion (considered desirable in this application) at lower power than other octal tubes such as 6L6, KT88 or 6550. The EL34 is found in many British guitar amps and is associated with the \\"British tone\\" (Vox, Marshall, Hiwatt, Orange) as compared to the 6L6 which is generally associated with the \\"American tone\\" (Fender/Mesa Boogie; the earlier classic Marshall \\"Plexi\\" amps used the KT66, a beam tetrode similar to the 6L6, as well).

Embassy of the United States in Japan. Embassy of Japan in the United States. or Japanese‚ÄìAmerican relations refers to international relations between Japan and the United States. Relations began in the late 18th and early 19th century, with the diplomatic but force- backed missions of U.S. ship captains James Glynn and Matthew C. Perry to the Tokugawa shogunate. The countries maintained relatively cordial relations after that. Potential disputes were resolved. Japan acknowledged American control of Hawaii and the Philippines and the United States reciprocated regarding Korea. Disagreements about Japanese immigration to the U.S. were resolved in 1907. The two were allies against Germany in World War I. From as early as 1879 and continuing through most of the first four decades of the 1900‚Äôs the influential Japanese statesmen, Prince Iyesato Tokugawa (1863-1940) and Baron Eiichi Shibusawa (1840-1931) led a major Japanese domestic and international movement advocating goodwill and mutual respect with the United States. Their friendship with the U.S. included allying with seven U.S. presidents, Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Harding, Hoover, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It was only after the passing of these two fine Japanese diplomats and humanitarians that Japanese militants were able to pressure Japan into joining with the Axis Powers in WWII. Starting in 1931, tensions escalated. Japanese actions against China in 1931 and especially after 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War caused the United States to cut off the oil and steel Japan required for their military conquests. Japan responded with attacks on the Allies, including the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which heavily damaged the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, opening the Pacific theater of World War II. The United States made a massive investment in naval power and systematically destroyed Japan's offensive capabilities while island hopping across the Pacific. To force a surrender, the Americans systematically bombed Japanese cities, culminating in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Japan surrendered, and was subjected to seven years of military occupation by the United States, during which the American occupiers under General Douglas MacArthur eliminated the military factor and rebuilt the economic and political systems so as to transform Japan into a democracy. In the 1950s and 1960s Japan, while neutral, grew rapidly by supplying American wars in Korea and Vietnam. The trade relationship has particularly prospered since then, with Japanese automobiles and consumer electronics being especially popular, and Japan became the world's second economic power after the United States. (In 2010 it dropped to third place after China). From the late 20th century and onwards, the United States and Japan have firm and very active political, economic and military relationships. The United States considers Japan to be one of its closest allies and partners. Japan is currently one of the most pro-American nations in the world, with 67% of Japanese viewing the United States favorably, according to a 2018 Pew survey; and 75% saying they trust the United States as opposed to 7% for China. Most Americans generally perceive Japan positively, with 81% viewing Japan favorably in 2013, the most favorable perception of Japan in the world. In recent years, Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe has enjoyed good relations with U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, with several friendly meetings in the United States and Japan, and other international conferences. In May 2019, President Trump became the first foreign leader to meet the new Emperor Naruhito. Historical background =Early American expeditions to Japan= USS Columbus of James Biddle, and an American crewman in Edo Bay in 1846. * In 1791, two American ships commanded by the American explorer John Kendrick stopped for 11 days on Kii ≈åshima island, south of the Kii Peninsula. He is the first American known to have visited Japan. He apparently planted an American flag and claimed the islands, but there is no Japanese account of his visit.Scott Ridley, Morning of Fire: John Kendrick's Daring American Odyssey in the Pacific (2010) * In 1846, Commander James Biddle, sent by the United States Government to open trade, anchored himself in Tokyo Bay with two ships, one of which was armed with seventy-two cannons. Regardless, his demands for a trade agreement remained unsuccessful.Spencer C. Tucker, Almanac of American Military History (2012) vol 1 p 682 * In 1848, Captain James Glynn sailed to Nagasaki, which led to the first successful negotiation by an American with sakoku Japan. Upon his return to North America, Glynn recommended to the Congress that any negotiations to open up Japan should be backed up by a demonstration of force; this paved the way for the later expedition of Commodore and lieutenant Matthew Perry.Charles Oscar Paullin, American voyages to the Orient, 1690‚Äì1865 (1910) p 113 =Commodore Perry opens Japan= Commodore Perry's fleet for his second visit to Japan in 1854.

Aboard a black-hulled steam frigate, he ported Mississippi, Plymouth, Saratoga, and Susquehanna at Uraga Harbor near Edo (present-day Tokyo) on July 8, 1853, and he was met by representatives of the Tokugawa Shogunate. They told him to proceed to Nagasaki, where the sakoku laws allowed limited trade by the Dutch. Perry refused to leave, and he demanded permission to present a letter from President Millard Fillmore, threatening force if he was denied. Japan had shunned modern technology for centuries, and the Japanese military would not be able to resist Perry's ships; these \\"Black Ships\\" would later become a symbol of threatening Western technology in Japan.Francis Hawks, Commodore Perry and the opening of Japan (2005) The Dutch behind the scenes smoothed the American treaty process with the Tokugawa shogunate.Martha Chaiklin, \\"Monopolists to Middlemen: Dutch Liberalism and American Imperialism in the Opening of Japan.\\" Journal of World History (2010): 249-269 online. Perry returned in March 1854 with twice as many ships, finding that the delegates had prepared a treaty embodying virtually all the demands in Fillmore's letter; Perry signed the U.S.- Japan Treaty of Peace and Amity on March 31, 1854, and returned home a hero.George Feifer, Breaking Open Japan: Commodore Perry, Lord Abe, and American Imperialism in 1853 (2013) Perry had a missionary vision to bring an American presence to Japan. His goal was to open commerce and more profoundly to introduce Western morals and values. The treaty gave priority to American interests over Japan's. Perry's forceful opening of Japan was used before 1945 to rouse Japanese resentment against the United States and the West; an unintended consequence was to facilitate Japanese militarism.George Feifer, \\"Perry and Pearl: The unintended consequence.\\" World Policy Journal 24.3 (2007): 103-110 online. Townsend Harris (1804‚Äì78) served 1856-1861 as the first American diplomat after Perry left.Tyler Dennett, Americans in Eastern Asia: a critical study of United States' policy in the Far East in the nineteenth century (1922) pp 347-66. He won the confidence of the Japanese leaders, who asked his advice on how to deal with Europeans. Harris in 1858 obtained the privilege of Americans to reside in Japan's four \\"open ports\\" and travel in designated areas. It banned the opium trade and set tariffs. He was the first foreigner to obtain an extended commercial agreement; it was more equitable than the unequal treaties soon obtained by Britain, France and Russia.Walter LaFeber, The Clash: US- Japanese relations throughout history (1998) pp 17-23.William Elliot Griffis, Townsend Harris, first American envoy in Japan (1895) online Pre‚ÄìWorld War II period =Japanese embassy to the United States= Kanrin Maru, Japan's first screw-driven steam warship, transported 1860s delegation to San Francisco.

Seven years later, the Sh≈çgun sent Kanrin Maru on a mission to the United States, intending to display Japan's mastery of Western navigation techniques and naval engineering. On January 19, 1860, Kanrin Maru left the Uraga Channel for San Francisco. The delegation included Katsu Kaishu as ship captain, Nakahama Manjir≈ç and Fukuzawa Yukichi. From San Francisco, the embassy continued to Washington via Panama on American vessels. Japan's official objective with this mission was to send its first embassy to the United States and to ratify the new Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between the two governments. The Kanrin Maru delegates also tried to revise some of the unequal clauses in Perry's treaties; they were unsuccessful. The first American diplomat was consul general Townsend Harris, who was present in Japan from 1856 until 1862 but was denied permission to present his credentials to the Sh≈çgun until 1858. He successfully negotiated the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, or the \\"Harris Treaty of 1858,\\" securing trade between the two nations and paving the way for greater Western influence in Japan's economy and politics. He was succeeded by Robert H. Pruyn, a New York politician who was a close friend and ally of Secretary of State William Henry Seward. Pruyn served from 1862 to 1865Edwin B. Lee \\"Robert H.

In the late 19th century, the opening of sugar plantations in the Kingdom of Hawaii led to the immigration of large numbers of Japanese families. Recruiters sent about 124,000 Japanese workers to more than fifty sugar plantations. China, the Philippines, Portugal and other countries sent an additional 300,000 workers. Hawaii became part of the U.S. in 1898, and the Japanese were the largest element of the population then. Although immigration from Japan largely ended by 1907, they have remained the largest element ever since. Both countries had ambitions for Hawaii and the Philippines, with the United States taking full ownership of both. The issue was resolved at a high level in 1905 in the Taft‚ÄìKatsura Agreement, with the United States also Acknowledging Japanese control of Korea.Raymond A.

Instead there was an informal \\"Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907\\" between the foreign ministers Elihu Root and Japan's Tadasu Hayashi. The Agreement said Japan would stop emigration of Japanese laborers to the U.S. or Hawaii, and there would not be segregation in California.

In 1912, the people of Japan sent 3,020 cherry trees to the United States as a gift of friendship. First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Helen Herron Taft, and the Viscountess Chinda, wife of the Japanese Ambassador, planted the first two cherry trees on the northern bank of the Tidal Basin. These two original trees are still standing today at the south end of 17th Street. Workmen planted the remainder of the trees around the Tidal Basin and East Potomac Park. In 1913 the California state legislature proposed the California Alien Land Law of 1913 that would exclude Japanese non-citizens from owning any land in the state. (The Japanese farmers put the title in the names of their American born children, who were U.S. citizens.) The Japanese government protested strongly. Previously, President Taft had managed to halt similar legislation but President Woodrow Wilson paid little attention until Tokyo's protest arrived. He then sent Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan to California; Bryan was unable to get California to relax the restrictions. Wilson did not use any of the legal remedies available to overturn the California law on the basis that it violated the 1911 treaty with Japan. Japan's reaction at both official and popular levels was anger at the American racism that simmered into the 1920s and 1930s.Herbert P.

When they returned home, they were often invited to give local lectures on what Japan was really like. In Japan they set up organizations such as colleges and civic groups. Historian John Davidann argues that the evangelical American YMCA missionaries linked Protestantism with American nationalism. They wanted converts to choose \\"Jesus over Japan\\". The Christians in Japan, although small minority, held a strong connection to the ancient \\"bushido\\" tradition of warrior ethics that undergirded Japanese nationalism.

Online More trouble arose between Japan on the one hand and China, Britain and the U.S. over Japan's Twenty-One Demands made on China in 1915. These demands forced China to acknowledge Japanese possession of the former German holdings and its economic dominance of Manchuria, and had the potential of turning China into a puppet state. Washington expressed strongly negative reactions to Japan's rejection of the Open Door Policy.

Tensions arose with the 1924 American immigration law that prohibited further immigration from Japan.Walter Lafeber, The Clash: A History of U.S.-Japan Relations (1997) =1929‚Äì1937: Militarism and tension between the wars= By the 1920s, Japanese intellectuals were underscoring the apparent decline of Europe as a world power, and increasingly saw Japan as the natural leader for all of East Asia. However, they identified a long-term threat from the colonial powers, especially Britain, the United States, the Netherlands and France, as deliberately blocking Japan's aspirations, especially regarding control of China. The goal became \\"Asia for the Asians\\" as Japan began mobilizing anti-colonial sentiment in India and Southeast Asia. Japan took control of Manchuria in 1931 over the strong objections of the League of Nations, Britain and especially the United States. In 1937, it seized control of the main cities on the East Coast of China, over strong American protests. Japanese leaders thought their deeply Asian civilization gave it a natural right to this control and refused to negotiate Western demands that it withdraw from China.John T. Davidann, \\"Citadels of Civilization: U.S. and Japanese Visions of World Order in the Interwar Period,\\" in Richard Jensen, Jon Davidann, and Yoneyuki Sugita, eds., Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century (2003) pp 21-44. = 1937‚Äì1941 = Relations between Japan and the United States became increasingly tense after the Mukden Incident and the subsequent Japanese military seizure of parts of China in 1937‚Äì39. American outrage focused on the Japanese attack on the US gunboat Panay in Chinese waters in late 1937‚ÄîJapan apologized after the attack‚Äîand the atrocities of the Nanjing Massacre at the same time. The United States had a powerful navy in the Pacific, and it was working closely with the British and the Dutch governments. When Japan seized Indochina (now Vietnam) in 1940‚Äì41, the United States, along with Australia, Britain and the Dutch government in exile, boycotted Japan via a trade embargo. They cut off 90% of Japan's oil supply, and Japan had to either withdraw from China or go to war with the US and Britain as well as China to get the oil. Under the Washington Naval treaty of 1922 and the London Naval treaty, the American navy was to be equal to the Japanese navy by a ratio of 10:6.Pelz, Stephen E. Race to Pearl Harbor. Harvard University Press 1974 However, by 1934, the Japanese ended their disarmament policies and enabled rearmament policy with no limitations. The government in Tokyo was well informed of its military weakness in the Pacific in regards to the American fleet. The foremost important factor in realigning their military policies was the need by Japan to seize British and Dutch oil wells.Maechling, Charles. Pearl Harbor: The First Energy War. History Today. Dec. 2000 Through the 1930s, Japan's military needed imported oil for airplanes and warships. It was dependent at 90% on imports, 80% of it coming from the United States. Furthermore, the vast majority of this oil import was oriented towards the navy and the military.Hein, Laura E. Fueling Growth. Harvard University Press 1990 America opposed Tokyo's expansionist policies in China and Indochina and, in 1940‚Äì41, decided to stop supplying the oil Japan was using for military expansion against American allies. On July 26, 1940 the U.S. government passed the Export Control Act, cutting oil, iron and steel exports to Japan. This containment policy was seen by Washington as a warning to Japan that any further military expansion would result in further sanctions. However, Tokyo saw it as a blockade to counter Japanese military and economic strength. Accordingly, by the time the United States enforced the Export Act, Japan had stockpiled around 54 million barrels of oil.Maechling, Charles. Pearl Harbor: The First Energy War. History Today.

President Roosevelt imposed increasingly stringent economic sanctions intended to deprive Japan of the oil and steel, as well as dollars, it needed to continue its war in China. Japan reacted by forging an alliance with Germany and Italy in 1940, known as the Tripartite Pact, which worsened its relations with the US. In July 1941, the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands froze all Japanese assets and cut off oil shipments‚ÄîJapan had little oil of its own.Conrad Totman, A History of Japan (2005). pp 554‚Äì556. Japan had conquered all of Manchuria and most of coastal China by 1939, but the Allies refused to recognize the conquests and stepped up their commitment.Herbert Feis, China Tangle: The American Effort in China from Pearl Harbor to the Marshall Mission (1953) contents President Franklin Roosevelt arranged for American pilots and ground crews to set up an aggressive Chinese Air Force nicknamed the Flying Tigers that would not only defend against Japanese air power but also start bombing the Japanese islands.Daniel Ford, Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941-1942 (2016). Diplomacy provided very little space for the adjudication of the deep differences between Japan and the United States. The United States was firmly and almost unanimously committed to defending the integrity of China. The isolationism that characterized the strong opposition of many Americans toward war in Europe did not apply to Asia. Japan had no friends in the United States, nor in Great Britain, nor the Netherlands. The United States had not yet declared war on Germany, but was closely collaborating with Britain and the Netherlands regarding the Japanese threat. The United States started to move its newest B-17 heavy bombers to bases in the Philippines, well within range of Japanese cities. The goal was deterrence of any Japanese attacks to the south. Furthermore, plans were well underway to ship American air forces to China, where American pilots in Chinese uniforms flying American warplanes, were preparing to bomb Japanese cities well before Pearl Harbor.Michael Schaller, \\"American Air Strategy in China, 1939-1941: The Origins of Clandestine Air Warfare\\" American Quarterly 28#1 (1976), pp. 3-19 in JSTORMartha Byrd, Chennault: Giving Wings to the Tiger (2003). Great Britain, although realizing it could not defend Hong Kong, was confident in its abilities to defend its major base in Singapore and the surrounding Malaya Peninsula. When the war did start in December 1941, Australian soldiers were rushed to Singapore, weeks before Singapore surrendered, and all the Australian and British forces were sent to prisoner of war camps.S. Woodburn Kirby, The War Against Japan: Volume I: The Loss of Singapore (HM Stationery Office, 195) pp 454-74. The Netherlands, with its homeland overrun by Germany, had a small Navy to defend the Dutch East Indies. Their role was to delay the Japanese invasion long enough to destroy the oil wells, drilling equipment, refineries and pipelines that were the main target of Japanese attacks. Decisions in Tokyo were controlled by the Army, and then rubber-stamped by Emperor Hirohito; the Navy also had a voice. However the civilian government and diplomats were largely ignored. The Army saw the conquest of China as its primary mission, but operations in Manchuria had created a long border with the USSR. Informal, large-scale military confrontations with USSR forces at Nomonhan in summer 1939 demonstrated that the USSR possessed a decisive military superiority. Even though it would help Germany's war against Russia after June 1941, the Japanese army refused to go north. The Japanese realized the urgent need for oil, over 90% of which was supplied by the United States, Britain and the Netherlands. From the Army's perspective, a secure fuel supply was essential for the warplanes, tanks and trucks‚Äîas well as the Navy's warships and warplanes. The solution was to send the Navy south, to seize the oilfields in the Dutch East Indies and nearby British colonies. Some admirals and many civilians, including Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro, believed that a war with the U.S. would end in defeat. The alternative was loss of honor and power.Haruo Tohmatsu and H. P. Willmott, A Gathering Darkness: The Coming of War to the Far East and the Pacific (2004) While the admirals were dubious about their long-term ability to confront the American and British navies, they hoped that a knockout blow destroying the American fleet at Pearl Harbor would bring the enemy to the negotiating table for a favorable outcome.Dorothy Borg and Shumpei Okamoto, eds. Pearl Harbor as History: Japanese-American Relations, 1931-1941 (1973). Japanese diplomats were sent to Washington in summer 1941 to engage in high-level negotiations. However, they did not speak for the Army leadership, which made the decisions. By early October both sides realized that no compromises were possible between the Japan's commitment to conquer China, and America's commitment to defend China. Japan's civilian government fell and the Army under General Tojo took full control, bent on war.Herbert Feis, Road to Pearl Harbor: The Coming of the War Between the United States and Japan (1950) pp. 277-78 table of contentsMichael A.

In response, the United States declared war on Japan. Japan's Axis allies, including Nazi Germany, declared war on the United States days after the attack, bringing the United States into World War II. sinking in Pearl Harbor The under attack at the Battle of Midway. The conflict was a bitter one, marked by atrocities such as the executions and torture of American prisoners of war by the Imperial Japanese Army and the desecration of dead Japanese bodies. Both sides interred enemy aliens. Superior American military production supported a campaign of island-hopping in the Pacific and heavy bombardment of cities in Okinawa and the Japanese mainland. The strategy was broadly successful as the Allies gradually occupied territories and moved toward the home islands, intending massive invasions beginning in fall 1945. Japanese resistance remained fierce. The Pacific War lasted until September 1, 1945, when Japan surrendered in response to the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ‚Äì among the most controversial acts in military history ‚Äì and the Soviet entry into the Asian theater of war following the surrender of Germany. The official Instrument of Surrender was signed on September 2, and the United States subsequently occupied Japan in its entirety. The Fat Man mushroom cloud resulting from the nuclear explosion over Nagasaki rises 18 km (11 mi, 60,000 ft) into the air from the hypocenter. Post‚ÄìWorld War II period =The U.S.-led Occupation of Japan= At the end of the Second World War, Japan was occupied by the Allied Powers, led by the United States with contributions from Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. This was the first time that Japan had ever been occupied by a foreign power. In the initial phase of the Occupation, the United States and the other Allied Powers, under the leadership of American general Douglas McArthur sought to carry out an thoroughgoing transformation of Japanese politics and society, in an effort to prevent Japan from threatening the peace again in the future. Among other measures, the Occupation authorities pressured Emperor Hirohito into renouncing his divinity, disbanded the Japanese military, purged wartime leaders from serving in government, ordered the dissolution of the massive zaibatsu industrial conglomerates that had powered Japan's war machine, vastly increased land ownership with an extensive land reform, legalized labor unions and the Japan Communist Party, gave women the right to vote, and sought to decentralize and democratize the police and the education system. Many of these changes were formalized in a brand new Constitution of Japan, written from scratch by Occupation authorities and then translated into Japanese and duly passed by the Japanese Diet. Most famously, Article 9 of the new constitution expressly forbade Japan from maintaining a military. However, as the Cold War began to ramp up, US leaders began to see Japan as less of a threat to peace and more as a potential industrial and military bulwark against communism in Asia. Accordingly, beginning in 1947, Occupation authorities began attempting to roll back many of the changes they had just implemented, in what became known as the \\"Reverse Course.\\" The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal of Japanese war criminals was brought to a hasty conclusion, wartime leaders were depurged and encouraged to return to government, the Occupation began cracking down on labor unions, the police were allowed to re- centralize and militarize, and the U.S. government began pressuring the Japanese government to get rid of Article 9 and fully remilitarize. In 1950, Occupation authorities collaborated with Japanese conservatives in business and government to carry out a massive \\"Red Purge\\" of tens of thousands of communists, socialists, and suspected fellow travelers, who were summarily fired from their jobs in government, schools, universities, and large corporations. In addition to making Japan more safe for free-market capitalism, the Occupation also sought to strengthen Japan's economy handing control over to American banker Joseph Dodge, who implemented a series of harsh measures to tackle inflation and limit government intervention in the economy, known collectively as the \\"Dodge Line.\\" The Occupation finally came to an end in 1952 with the enactment of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which returned sovereignty to Japan. The treaty was signed on September 8, 1951 and took effect on April 28, 1952. As a condition of ending the Occupation and restoring its sovereignty, Japan was also required to sign the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which brought Japan into a military alliance with the United States. =1950s: After the occupation= In the years after World War II, Japan's relations with the United States were placed on an equal footing for the first time at the end of the occupation by the Allied forces in April 1952. This equality, the legal basis of which was laid down in the peace treaty signed by forty-eight Allied nations and Japan, was initially largely nominal. A favorable Japanese balance of payments with the United States was achieved in 1954, mainly as a result of United States military and aid spending in Japan.LaFeber, The Clash: US-Japanese Relations Throughout History ch 10 The Japanese people's feeling of dependence lessened gradually as the disastrous results of World War II subsided into the background and trade with the United States expanded. Self-confidence grew as the country applied its resources and organizational skill to regaining economic health. This situation gave rise to a general desire for greater independence from United States influence. During the 1950s and 1960s, this feeling was especially evident in the Japanese attitude toward United States military bases on the four main islands of Japan and in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying the southern two-thirds of the Ryukyu Islands. The government had to balance left-wing pressure advocating dissociation from the United States allegedly 'against the realities' of the need for military protection. Recognizing the popular desire for the return of the Ryukyu Islands and the Bonin Islands (also known as the Ogasawara Islands), the United States as early as 1953 relinquished its control of the Amami group of islands at the northern end of the Ryukyu Islands. But the United States made no commitment to return Okinawa, which was then under United States military administration for an indefinite period as provided in Article 3 of the peace treaty. Popular agitation culminated in a unanimous resolution adopted by the Diet in June 1956, calling for a return of Okinawa to Japan. =1960s: Military alliance and return of territories= Bilateral talks on revising the 1952 security pact began in 1959, and the new Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security was signed in Washington on January 19, 1960. When the pact was submitted to the Diet for ratification on February 5, it became the subject of bitter debate over the Japan‚ÄìUnited States relationship and the occasion for violence in an all-out effort by the leftist opposition to prevent its passage. It was finally approved by the House of Representatives on May 20. Japan Socialist Party deputies boycotted the lower house session and tried to prevent the LDP deputies from entering the chamber; they were forcibly removed by the police. Massive demonstrations and rioting by students and trade unions followed. These outbursts prevented a scheduled visit to Japan by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and precipitated the resignation of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke, but not before the treaty was passed by default on June 19, when the House of Councillors failed to vote on the issue within the required thirty days after lower house approval.LaFeber, The Clash: US-Japanese Relations Throughout History ch 11 Under the treaty, both parties assumed an obligation to assist each other in case of armed attack on territories under Japanese administration. (It was understood, however, that Japan could not come to the defense of the United States because it was constitutionally forbidden to send armed forces overseas (Article 9). In particular, the constitution forbids the maintenance of \\"land, sea, and air forces.\\" It also expresses the Japanese people's renunciation of \\"the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes\\". Accordingly, the Japanese find it difficult to send their \\"self-defense\\" forces overseas, even for peace-keeping purposes.) The scope of the new treaty did not extend to the Ryukyu Islands, but an appended minute made clear that in case of an armed attack on the islands, both governments would consult and take appropriate action. Notes accompanying the treaty provided for prior consultation between the two governments before any major change occurred in the deployment of United States troops or equipment in Japan. Unlike the 1952 security pact, the new treaty provided for a ten-year term, after which it could be revoked upon one year's notice by either party. The treaty included general provisions on the further development of international cooperation and on improved future economic cooperation. Both countries worked closely to fulfill the United States promise, under Article 3 of the peace treaty, to return all Japanese territories acquired by the United States in war. In June 1968, the United States returned the Bonin Islands (including Iwo Jima) to Japanese administration control. In 1969, the Okinawa reversion issue and Japan's security ties with the United States became the focal points of partisan political campaigns. The situation calmed considerably when Prime Minister Sato Eisaku visited Washington in November 1969, and in a joint communiqu√© signed by him and President Richard Nixon, announced the United States agreement to return Okinawa to Japan in 1972. In June 1971, after eighteen months of negotiations, the two countries signed an agreement providing for the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972.Gavan McCormack, and Satoko Oka Norimatsu, Resistant Islands: Okinawa Confronts Japan and the United States (2012) The Japanese government's firm and voluntary endorsement of the security treaty and the settlement of the Okinawa reversion question meant that two major political issues in Japan‚ÄìUnited States relations were eliminated. But new issues arose. In July 1971, the Japanese government was surprised by Nixon's dramatic announcement of his forthcoming visit to the People's Republic of China. Many Japanese were chagrined by the failure of the United States to consult in advance with Japan before making such a fundamental change in foreign policy. The following month, the government was again surprised to learn that, without prior consultation, the United States had imposed a 10 percent surcharge on imports, a decision certain to hinder Japan's exports to the United States. Relations between Tokyo and Washington were further strained by the monetary crisis involving the December 1971 revaluation of the Japanese yen. These events of 1971 marked the beginning of a new stage in relations, a period of adjustment to a changing world situation that was not without episodes of strain in both political and economic spheres, although the basic relationship remained close. The political issues between the two countries were essentially security-related and derived from efforts by the United States to induce Japan to contribute more to its own defense and to regional security. The economic issues tended to stem from the ever-widening United States trade and payments deficits with Japan, which began in 1965 when Japan reversed its imbalance in trade with the United States and, for the first time, achieved an export surplus. Heavy American military spending in the Korean War (1950‚Äì53) and the Vietnam War (1965‚Äì73) provided a major stimulus to the Japanese economy.T. R. H. Havens, Fire Across the Sea: The Vietnam War and Japan, 1965‚Äì1975 (1987) =1970s: Vietnam War and Middle-East crisis= The United States withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975 and the end of the Vietnam War meant that the question of Japan's role in the security of East Asia and its contributions to its own defense became central topics in the dialogue between the two countries. American dissatisfaction with Japanese defense efforts began to surface in 1975 when Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger publicly stigmatized Japan. The Japanese government, constrained by constitutional limitations and strongly pacifist public opinion, responded slowly to pressures for a more rapid buildup of its Self-Defense Forces (SDF). It steadily increased its budgetary outlays for those forces, however, and indicated its willingness to shoulder more of the cost of maintaining the United States military bases in Japan. In 1976 the United States and Japan formally established a subcommittee for defense cooperation, in the framework of a bilateral Security Consultative Committee provided for under the 1960 security treaty. This subcommittee, in turn, drew up new Guidelines for Japan-United States Defense Cooperation, under which military planners of the two countries have conducted studies relating to joint military action in the event of an armed attack on Japan.LaFeber, The Clash: US-Japanese Relations Throughout History ch 12 On the economic front, Japan sought to ease trade frictions by agreeing to Orderly Marketing Arrangements, which limited exports on products whose influx into the United States was creating political problems. In 1977 an Orderly Marketing Arrangement limiting Japanese color television exports to the United States was signed, following the pattern of an earlier disposition of the textile problem. Steel exports to the United States were also curtailed, but the problems continued as disputes flared over United States restrictions on Japanese development of nuclear fuel- reprocessing facilities, Japanese restrictions on certain agricultural imports, such as beef and oranges, and liberalization of capital investment and government procurement within Japan. Under American pressure Japan worked toward a comprehensive security strategy with closer cooperation with the United States for a more reciprocal and autonomous basis. This policy was put to the test in November 1979, when radical Iranians seized the United States embassy in Tehran, taking sixty hostages. Japan reacted by condemning the action as a violation of international law. At the same time, Japanese trading firms and oil companies reportedly purchased Iranian oil that had become available when the United States banned oil imported from Iran. This action brought sharp criticism from the United States of Japanese government \\"insensitivity\\" for allowing the oil purchases and led to a Japanese apology and agreement to participate in sanctions against Iran in concert with other United States allies. Following that incident, the Japanese government took greater care to support United States international policies designed to preserve stability and promote prosperity. Japan was prompt and effective in announcing and implementing sanctions against the Soviet Union following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. In 1981, in response to United States requests, it accepted greater responsibility for defense of seas around Japan, pledged greater support for United States forces in Japan, and persisted with a steady buildup of the SDF. =1980s: Reagan and Nakasone = Trade issues with Japan dominated relationships, especially the threat that American automobile and high tech industries would be overwhelmed. Japan's economic miracle emerged from a systematic program of subsidized investment in strategic industries -- steel, machinery, electronics, chemicals, autos, shipbuilding, and aircraft.Clyde V.

During Reagan‚Äôs first term Japanese government and private investors held a third of the debt sold by the US Treasury, providing Americans with hard currency used to buy Japanese goods.Michael Schaller, Altered States: The United States and Japan since the Occupation (Oxford UP, 1997), pp. 254‚Äì55. In March 1985 the Senate voted 92‚Äì0 in favor of a Republican resolution that condemned Japan's trade practices as ‚Äúunfair‚Äù and called on President Reagan curb Japanese imports. Andrew P. Cortell, \\"Centralization, access, and influence: The Reagan administration and the semiconductor industry's trade complaints.\\" Governance 10.3 (1997): 261-285. In 1981, Japanese automakers entered into the \\"voluntary export restraint\\" limiting the number of autos that they could export to the U.S. to 1.68 million per year. Barbara A. Sousa, Regulating Japanese Automobile Imports: Some Implications of the Voluntary Quota System, 5 British Columbia International and Comparative Law Review (1982) pp 431+, One side effect of this quota was that Japanese car companies opened new divisions through which they began developing luxury cars that had higher profit margins, such as with Toyota's Lexus, Honda's Acura, and Nissan's Infiniti. Another consequence was that the Japanese car makers began opening auto production plants in the U.S., with the three largest Japanese auto manufacturers all opening production facilities by 1985. These facilities were opened primarily in the southern U.S., in states which disadvantaged unions through right-to-work laws. The UAW failed in its substantial union-organizing efforts at these plants. The Big Three also began investing in and/or developing joint manufacturing facilities with several of the Japanese automakers. Ford invested in Mazda as well as setting up a joint facility with them called AutoAlliance International. Chrysler bought stock in Mitsubishi Motors and established a joint facility with them called Diamond-Star Motors. GM invested in Suzuki and Isuzu Motors, and set up a joint manufacturing facility with Toyota, called NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.).Thomas W. Zeiler, \\"Business Is War in US-‚ÄêJapanese Economic Relations, 1977-‚Äê2001.\\" in Partnership: The United States and Japan 1951-2001 ed. by Akira Irike and Robert Wampler, (2001) pp: 223-48. A qualitatively new stage of Japan-United States cooperation in world affairs appeared to be reached in late 1982 with the election of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. Officials of the Reagan administration worked closely with their Japanese counterparts to develop a personal relationship between the two leaders based on their common security and international outlook. President Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone enjoyed a particularly close relationship. It was Nakasone who backed Reagan to deploy Pershing missiles in Europe at the 1983 9th G7 summit. Nakasone reassured United States leaders of Japan's determination against the Soviet threat, closely coordinated policies with the United States toward Asian trouble spots such as the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia, and worked cooperatively with the United States in developing China policy. The Japanese government welcomed the increase of American forces in Japan and the western Pacific, continued the steady buildup of the SDF, and positioned Japan firmly on the side of the United States against the threat of Soviet international expansion. Japan continued to cooperate closely with United States policy in these areas following Nakasone's term of office, although the political leadership scandals in Japan in the late 1980s (i.e. the Recruit scandal) made it difficult for newly elected President George H. W. Bush to establish the same kind of close personal ties that marked the Reagan years. A specific example of Japan's close cooperation with the United States included its quick response to the United States' call for greater host nation support from Japan following the rapid realignment of Japan-United States currencies in the mid-1980s due to the Plaza and Louvre Accords. The currency realignment resulted in a rapid rise of United States costs in Japan, which the Japanese government, upon United States request, was willing to offset. Another set of examples was provided by Japan's willingness to respond to United States requests for foreign assistance to countries considered of strategic importance to the West. During the 1980s, United States officials voiced appreciation for Japan's \\"strategic aid\\" to countries such as [Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, and Jamaica. Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki's pledges of support for East European and Middle Eastern countries in 1990 fit the pattern of Japan's willingness to share greater responsibility for world stability. Another example of US-Japan cooperation is through energy cooperation. In 1983 a US-Japan working group, chaired by William Flynn Martin, produced the Reagan-Nakasone Joint Statement on Japan-United States Energy Cooperation. Other instances of energy relations is shown through the US-Japan Nuclear Cooperation Agreement of 1987 which was an agreement concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Testimony by William Flynn Martin, US Deputy Secretary of Energy, outlined the highlights of the nuclear agreement, including the benefits to both countries. Reagan greeting leaders including Prime Minister Nakasone, Foreign Minister Abe, Finance Minister Takashita in London in 1984 Despite complaints from some Japanese businesses and diplomats, the Japanese government remained in basic agreement with United States policy toward China and Indochina. The government held back from large-scale aid efforts until conditions in China and Indochina were seen as more compatible with Japanese and United States interests. Of course, there also were instances of limited Japanese cooperation. Japan's response to the United States decision to help to protect tankers in the Persian Gulf during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980‚Äì88) was subject to mixed reviews. Some United States officials stressed the positive, noting that Japan was unable to send military forces because of constitutional reasons but compensated by supporting the construction of a navigation system in the Persian Gulf, providing greater host nation support for United States forces in Japan, and providing loans to Oman and Jordan. Japan's refusal to join even in a mine-sweeping effort in the Persian Gulf was an indication to some United States officials of Tokyo's unwillingness to cooperate with the United States in areas of sensitivity to Japanese leaders at home or abroad. The main area of noncooperation with the United States in the 1980s was Japanese resistance to repeated United States efforts to get Japan to open its market more to foreign goods and to change other economic practices seen as adverse to United States economic interests. A common pattern was followed. The Japanese government was sensitive to political pressures from important domestic constituencies that would be hurt by greater openness. In general, these constituencies were of two types‚Äîthose representing inefficient or \\"declining\\" producers, manufacturers, and distributors, who could not compete if faced with full foreign competition; and those up-and-coming industries that the Japanese government wished to protect from foreign competition until they could compete effectively on world markets. To deal with domestic pressures while trying to avoid a break with the United States, the Japanese government engaged in protracted negotiations. This tactic bought time for declining industries to restructure themselves and new industries to grow stronger. Agreements reached dealt with some aspects of the problems, but it was common for trade or economic issues to be dragged out in talks over several years, involving more than one market-opening agreement. Such agreements were sometimes vague and subject to conflicting interpretations in Japan and the United States. Growing interdependence was accompanied by markedly changing circumstances at home and abroad that were widely seen to have created a crisis in Japan‚ÄìUnited States relations in the late 1980s. United States government officials continued to emphasize the positive aspects of the relationship but warned that there was a need for \\"a new conceptual framework\\". The Wall Street Journal publicized a series of lengthy reports documenting changes in the relationship in the late 1980s and reviewing the considerable debate in Japan and the United States over whether a closely cooperative relationship was possible or appropriate for the 1990s. An authoritative review of popular and media opinion, published in 1990 by the Washington-based Commission on US-Japan Relations for the Twenty-first Century, was concerned with preserving a close Japan‚ÄìUnited States relationship. It warned of a \\"new orthodoxy\\" of \\"suspicion, criticism and considerable self-justification\\", which it said was endangering the fabric of Japan‚ÄìUnited States relations. The relative economic power of Japan and the United States was undergoing sweeping change, especially in the 1980s. This change went well beyond the implications of the United States trade deficit with Japan, which had remained between US$40 billion and US$48 billion annually since the mid-1980s. The persisting United States trade and budget deficits of the early 1980s led to a series of decisions in the middle of the decade that brought a major realignment of the value of Japanese and United States currencies. The stronger Japanese currency gave Japan the ability to purchase more United States goods and to make important investments in the United States. By the late 1980s, Japan was the main international creditor. Japan's growing investment in the United States‚Äîit was the second largest investor after Britain‚Äîled to complaints from some American constituencies. Moreover, Japanese industry seemed well positioned to use its economic power to invest in the high-technology products in which United States manufacturers were still leaders. The United States's ability to compete under these circumstances was seen by many Japanese and Americans as hampered by heavy personal, government, and business debt and a low savings rate. In the late 1980s, the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe and the growing preoccupation of Soviet leaders with massive internal political and economic difficulties forced the Japanese and United States governments to reassess their longstanding alliance against the Soviet threat. Officials of both nations had tended to characterize the security alliance as the linchpin of the relationship, which should have priority over economic and other disputes. Some Japanese and United States officials and commentators continued to emphasize the common dangers to Japan- United States interests posed by the continued strong Soviet military presence in Asia. They stressed that until Moscow followed its moderation in Europe with major demobilization and reductions in its forces positioned against the United States and Japan in the Pacific, Washington and Tokyo needed to remain militarily prepared and vigilant. Increasingly, however, other perceived benefits of close Japan- United States security ties were emphasized. The alliance was seen as deterring other potentially disruptive forces in East Asia, notably the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). Some United States officials noted that the alliance helped keep Japan's potential military power in check and under the supervision of the United States. 21st century: Stronger alliance in the context of a rising China pitch to a U.S. Navy captain. Japan and the U.S. share many cultural links, including a love for baseball imported from the US. By the late 1990s and beyond, the US-Japan relationship had been improved and strengthened. The major cause of friction in the relationship, e.g. trade disputes, became less problematic as China displaced Japan as the greatest perceived economic threat to the U.S. Meanwhile, though in the immediate post‚ÄìCold War period the security alliance suffered from a lack of a defined threat, the emergence of North Korea as a belligerent rogue state and China's economic and military expansion provided a purpose to strengthen the relationship. While the foreign policy of the administration of President George W. Bush put a strain on some of the United States' international relations, the alliance with Japan became stronger, as evidenced in the Deployment of Japanese troops to Iraq and the joint development of anti-missile defense systems. The notion that Japan is becoming the \\"Great Britain of the Pacific\\", or the key and pivotal ally of the U.S. in the region, is frequently alluded to in international studies, but the extent to which this is true is still the subject of academic debate. In 2009, the Democratic Party of Japan came into power with a mandate calling for changes in the recently agreed security realignment plan and has opened a review into how the accord was reached, claiming the U.S. dictated the terms of the agreement, but United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that the U.S. Congress was unwilling to pay for any changes. Some U.S. officials worried that the government led by the Democratic Party of Japan would maybe consider a policy shift away from the United States and toward a more independent foreign policy. In 2013 China and Russia held joint naval drills in what Chinese state media called an attempt to challenge the American-Japanese alliance. On September 19, 2013, Caroline Kennedy sat before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and responded to questions from both Republican and Democratic senators in relation to her appointment as the US ambassador to Japan. Kennedy, nominated by President Obama in early 2013, explained that her focus would be military ties, trade, and student exchange if she was confirmed for the position. CIA activities in Japan From the 1950s through the 1970s, the United States Central Intelligence Agency spent millions of dollars attempting to influence elections in Japan to favor the LDP against more leftist parties such as the Socialists and the Communists, although this was not revealed until the mid-1990s when it was exposed by The New York Times. Economic relations =Trade volume= U.S. trade deficit (in billions, goods only) by country in 2014 The United States has been Japan's largest economic partner, taking 31.5% of its exports, supplying 22.3% of its imports, and accounting for 45.9% of its direct investment abroad in 1990. As of 2013, the United States takes up 18% of Japanese exports, and supplies 8.5% of its imports (the slack having been picked up by China, which now provides 22%). Japan's imports from the United States included both raw materials and manufactured goods. United States agricultural products were a leading import in 1990 (US$8.5 billion as measured by United States export statistics), made up of meat (US$1.5 billion), fish (US$1.8 million), grains (US$2.4 billion), and soybeans (US$8.8 billion). Imports of manufactured goods were mainly in the category of machinery and transportation equipment, rather than consumer goods. In 1990 Japan imported US$11.1 billion of machinery from the United States, of which computers and computer parts (US$3.9 billion) formed the largest single component. In the category of transportation equipment, Japan imported US$3.3 billion of aircraft and parts (automobiles and parts accounted for only US$1.8 billion). Japan's exports to the United States were almost entirely manufactured goods. Automobiles were by far the largest single category, amounting to US$21.5 billion in 1990, or 24% of total Japanese exports to the United States. Automotive parts accounted for another US$10.7 billion. Other major items were office machinery (including computers), which totaled US$8.6 billion in 1990, telecommunications equipment (US$4.1 billion) and power-generating machinery (US$451 million). From the mid-1960s, the trade balance has been in Japan's favor. According to Japanese data, its surplus with the United States grew from US$380 million in 1970 to nearly US$48 billion in 1988, declining to approximately US$38 billion in 1990. United States data on the trade relationship (which differ slightly because each nation includes transportation costs on the import side but not the export side) also show a rapid deterioration of the imbalance in the 1980s, from a Japanese surplus of US$10 billion in 1980 to one of US$60 billion in 1987, with an improvement to one of US$37.7 billion in 1990. =Trade frictions= Notable outpourings of United States congressional and media rhetoric critical of Japan accompanied the disclosure in 1987 that Toshiba had illegally sold sophisticated machinery of United States origin to the Soviet Union, which reportedly allowed Moscow to make submarines quiet enough to avoid United States detection, and the United States congressional debate in 1989 over the Japan-United States agreement to develop a new fighter aircraft‚Äîthe FSX‚Äîfor the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.Packard, George R. The Coming US-Japan Crisis. Foreign Affairs. Retrieved 16-09-2011.Mann, Jim. FSX Deal Becomes Test of U.S., Japan Relations. 06 March 1989. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 16-09-2011. =Direct investment= As elsewhere, Japan's direct investment in the United States expanded rapidly and is an important new dimension in the countries' relationship. The total value of cumulative investments of this kind was US$8.7 billion in 1980. By 1990, it had grown to US$83.1 billion. United States data identified Japan as the second largest investor in the United States; it had about half the value of investments of Britain, but more than those of the Netherlands, Canada, or West Germany. Much of Japan's investment in the United States in the late 1980s was in the commercial sector, providing the basis for distribution and sale of Japanese exports to the United States. Wholesale and retail distribution accounted for 32.2% of all Japanese investments in the United States in 1990, while manufacturing accounted for 20.6%. Real estate became a popular investment during the 1980s, with cumulative investments rising to US$15.2 billion by 1988, or 18.4% of total direct investment in the United States. =Energy= The US and Japan find themselves in fundamentally different situations regarding energy and energy security. Cooperation in energy has moved from conflict (the embargo of Japanese oil was the trigger that launched the Pearl Harbor attack) to cooperation with two significant agreements being signed during the 1980s: the Reagan-Nakasone Energy Cooperation Agreement and the US-Japan Nuclear Cooperation Agreement of 1987 (allowing the Japanese to reprocess nuclear fuels).Roger Buckley, U. S.-Japan Alliance Diplomacy, 1945-1990 (1995) p 144 Further cooperation occurred during the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami with US troops aiding the victims of the disaster zone and US scientists from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy advising on the response to the nuclear incident at Fukushima. In 2013 the Department of Energy allowed the export of American natural gas to Japan.Dick K. Nanto, ed. Japan's 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami: Economic Effects and Implications for the United States (DIANE Publishing, 2011). Military relations Major US military bases in Japan US military bases in Okinawa Japanese Maritime Self- Defense Force ship JS Kunisaki (right) participates in a training exercise with (left) in 2019 The 1952 Mutual Security Assistance Pact provided the initial basis for the nation's security relations with the United States. The pact was replaced in 1960 by the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, which declares that both nations will maintain and develop their capacities to resist armed attack in common and that each recognizes that an armed attack on either one in territories administered by Japan will be considered dangerous to the safety of the other. The Agreed Minutes to the treaty specified that the Japanese government must be consulted prior to major changes in United States force deployment in Japan or to the use of Japanese bases for combat operations other than in defense of Japan itself. However, Japan was relieved by its constitutional prohibition of participating in external military operations from any obligation to defend the United States if it were attacked outside of Japanese territories. In 1990 the Japanese government expressed its intention to continue to rely on the treaty's arrangements to guarantee national security.Anthony Difilippo, The Challenges of the U.S.-Japan Military Arrangement (2002) The Agreed Minutes under Article 6 of the 1960 treaty contain a status-of-forces agreement on the stationing of United States forces in Japan, with specifics on the provision of facilities and areas for their use and on the administration of Japanese citizens employed in the facilities. Also covered are the limits of the two countries' jurisdictions over crimes committed in Japan by United States military personnel. The Mutual Security Assistance Pact of 1952 initially involved a military aid program that provided for Japan's acquisition of funds, mat√©riel, and services for the nation's essential defense. Although Japan no longer received any aid from the United States by the 1960s, the agreement continued to serve as the basis for purchase and licensing agreements ensuring interoperability of the two nations' weapons and for the release of classified data to Japan, including both international intelligence reports and classified technical information. As of 2014 the United States had 50,000 troops in Japan, the headquarters of the US 7th Fleet and more than 10,000 Marines. In May 2014 it was revealed the United States was deploying two unarmed Global Hawk long-distance surveillance drones to Japan with the expectation they would engage in surveillance missions over China and North Korea. At the beginning of October 2018 the new Japanese Mobile Amphibious Forces held joint exercises with the US marines in the Japanese prefecture of Kagoshima, the purpose of which was to work out the actions in defense of remote territories. =Ryukyu Islands (Okinawa)= Okinawa is the site of major American military bases that have caused problems, as Japanese and Okinawans have protested their presence for decades. In secret negotiations that began in 1969 Washington sought unrestricted use of its bases for possible conventional combat operations in Korea, Taiwan, and South Vietnam, as well as the emergency re-entry and transit rights of nuclear weapons. However anti-nuclear sentiment was strong in Japan and the government wanted the U.S. to remove all nuclear weapons from Okinawa. In the end, the United States and Japan agreed to maintain bases that would allow the continuation of American deterrent capabilities in East Asia. In 1972 the Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa, reverted to Japanese control and the provisions of the 1960 security treaty were extended to cover them. The United States retained the right to station forces on these islands.Yukinori Komine, \\"Okinawa Confidential, 1969: Exploring the Linkage between the Nuclear Issue and the Base Issue,\\" Diplomatic History (2013) 37#4 pp 807-840. Military relations improved after the mid-1970s. In 1960 the Security Consultative Committee, with representatives from both countries, was set up under the 1960 security treaty to discuss and coordinate security matters concerning both nations. In 1976 a subcommittee of that body prepared the Guidelines for Japan-United States Defense Cooperation that were approved by the full committee in 1978 and later approved by the National Defense Council and cabinet. The guidelines authorized unprecedented activities in joint defense planning, response to an armed attack on Japan, and cooperation on situations in Asia and the Pacific region that could affect Japan's security. A dispute that had boiled since 1996 regarding a base with 18,000 U.S. Marines had temporarily been resolved in late 2013. Agreement had been reached to move the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to a less-densely populated area of Okinawa.Hiroko Tabuchi and Thom Shanker, \\"Deal to Move Okinawa Base Wins Approval,\\" New York Times Dec. 27, 2013 =National intelligence= Japan's limited intelligence gathering capability and personnel are focused on China and North Korea, as the nation primarily relies on the American National Security Agency. Public opinion According to a 2015 Pew survey, 68% of Americans believe that the US can trust Japan, compared to 75% of Japanese who believe that Japan can trust the United States. According to a 2017 Pew survey, 57% of people in Japan had a favorable view of the United States, 75% had a favorable view of the American people, and 24% had confidence in the US president. A 2018 Gallup poll showed that 87% of Americans had a favorable view of Japan. Historiography In addition, because World War II was a global war, diplomatic historians start to focus on Japanese‚ÄìAmerican relations to understand why Japan had attacked the United States in 1941. This in turn led diplomatic historians to start to abandon the previous Euro- centric approach in favor of a more global approach.Saho Matusumoto, \\"Diplomatic History\\" in Kelly Boyd, ed., The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing (1999) pp 314‚Äì165 A sign of the changing times was the rise to prominence of such diplomatic historians such as the Japanese historian Chihiro Hosoya, the British historian Ian Nish, and the American historian Akira Iriye, which was the first time that Asian specialists became noted diplomatic historians.T.G. Fraser and Peter Lowe, eds. Conflict and Amity in East Asia: Essays in Honour of Ian Nish (1992) excerpt pp 77-91. The Japanese reading public has a demand for books about American history and society.

In 1960, he helped his main club win the Portuguese Cup against Sporting CP (2‚Äì1); he left in the summer of 1964 at the age of 37, after only appearing in a combined four games in his last two seasons due to a serious leg injury from which he never fully recovered. Matateu then joined neighbouring Atl√©tico Clube de Portugal of the second division, helping to promotion in his second year. In the 1966‚Äì67 season ‚Äì his final in the Portuguese top flight ‚Äì the 39-year-old contributed with nine goals in 21 appearances, but the team suffered relegation after ranking second bottom (13th position); in the following three years, he played with Clube Desportivo de Gouveia in the second tier and amateur football with Amora F.C. and G.D. Chaves. Matateu retired from professional football well past his 40s, after spending several years in Canada, where he played in the National Soccer League with First Portuguese Canadian Cultural Centre. In 1971 he headed westward to Victoria, British Columbia, and represented Latino in the Vancouver Island Soccer League; he played a pivotal role in the creation of Sagres Victoria. International career Matateu earned 27 caps for Portugal, and scored 13 goals. After making his debut on 23 November 1952 in a friendly with Austria in Porto, his last appearance was against Yugoslavia on 22 May 1960 for the 1960 European Nations' Cup (1‚Äì5 away loss, he netted in the first leg, a 2‚Äì1 win), aged 32.

Born in Hednesford, Staffordshire, Rogers made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against Gloucestershire at New Road in June 1923, taking two wickets in the game. He appeared in only one more match that season, taking another two wickets, but played a bigger part in the county's 1924 season when he played in nine games; however, he finished the year with only five wickets and 37 runs from those nine appearances. 1925 was a much more productive year for Rogers, who claimed 68 wickets at an average of 23.11, including four five-wicket innings hauls. The best of these, and indeed the best innings return of his career, was 8-85 against an extremely strong Yorkshire side who were to win their fourth County Championship title in as many years that season. Rogers' efforts were in vain as Worcestershire were bundled out for 65 in their second innings (Macaulay 7-20) to lose by an innings. 1925 also saw his best batting performances, including his only century: he scored 118 not out from number three in the order against Sussex at Amblecote. The second-highest score in Rogers' career was just 50 not out, made against Northamptonshire that same summer. Rogers never recaptured the heights of 1925, and although he still chipped in with useful wickets (such as his 5-54 against Yorkshire in 1927) he never again took more than 33 wickets in a season. He played a solitary first-class match for Worcestershire against Kent in 1928, conceding 51 runs from ten barren overs, and that was that. He died in Worcester at the age of 67.

Early history Before the late 1890s, the image portrayed of African-Americans on Broadway was a \\"secondhand vision of black life created by European-American performers.\\"Allen L. Woll, Black Musical Theater: From Coontown to Dreamgirls. Baton Rouge, LA: Louisiana State University Press, 1989; pg. 1. Stereotyped \\"coon songs\\" were popular, and blackface was common. Will Marion Cook and Bob Cole brought black-written musical comedy to Broadway in 1898. Cook's Clorindy, or The Origin of the Cake Walk, an hour-long sketch that was the first all-black show to play in a prestigious Broadway house, Casino Theatre's Roof Garden. Cole's A Trip to Coontown was the first full-length New York musical comedy written, directed and performed exclusively by blacks. The approach of the two composers were diametrically opposed: Cole believed that African Americans should try to compete with European Americans by proving their ability to act similarly on- and offstage, while Cook thought African Americans should not imitate European Americans but instead create their own style. Bob Cole and brothers John Rosamond Johnson and James Weldon Johnson focused on elevating the lyrical sophistication of African American songs. Their first collaboration was \\"Louisiana Lize\\", a love song written in a new lyrical style that left out the watermelons, razors, and \\"hot mamas\\" typical of earlier \\"coon songs.\\"Woll, Black Musical Theater, pg. 15. Cole and the Johnson brothers went on to create musicals such as The Belle of Bridgeport, The Red Moon (with Joe Jordan), The Shoo-Fly Regiment, In Newport, Humpty Dumpty, and Sally in Our Alley (featuring Bob Cole's \\"Under The Bamboo Tree\\"). Bob Cole's suicide in 1911 ended \\"one of the promising musical comedy teams yet seen on Broadway\\". National recognition George Walker, Adah Overton Walker and Bert Williams dance the cakewalk in the first Broadway musical written and performed by African Americans, In Dahomey (1903). Bert Williams and George Walker, called the \\"Two Real Coons\\", found fame in 1896 with a musical farce called The Gold Bug. The duo's performance of the cakewalk captured the audience's attention, and they soon became so closely associated with this dance that many people think of them as its originators. Williams met Walker in San Francisco in 1893, while they played Dahomeyans in an exhibit of the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894. They played different venues while putting together their act. Williams and Walker were dropped from \\"Isham's Octoroons\\", one of the first African American companies to break from the minstrel style performance.Woll, Black Musical Theater, pp. 33-41. They then put together a number of small productions including A Lucky Coon, Sons of Ham, and The Policy Players, but their ultimate goal was to produce and star in their own Broadway musical. So they thought back to the times in San Francisco and produced In Dahomey (1903) alongside Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Jesse A. Shipp, and Will Marion Cook. Abyssinia (1906) and Bandanna Land (1908) also stood high in the Williams and Walker claim to fame. Their dreams of stardom come to life and they took musicals in a new direction, back to Africa. George Walker died during the run of Bandanna Land and his wife Ada Overton Walker substituted for him during the final week of the run.Woll, Black Musical Theater, pg. 48. Crossover shows By 1911, Ernest Hogan, Bob Cole, and George Walker had died. Will Marion Cook and the Johnson brothers, James and J. Rosamond, had pursued new careers and Bert Williams moved to the Ziegfeld Follies and black musical theater went into a hiatus.Woll, Black Musical Theater, pg. 50. In 1915 ragtime composer Scott Joplin attempted to stage an opera Treemonisha in Harlem but the show was a financial and critical failure and Joplin was ruined and retreated into retirement until his death in 1917. In May 1921, the surprising hit Shuffle Along made its way to New York City with almost $18,000 in debt. \\"One of the most popular black shows of the 1920s; began to tinker with the pattern of segregation\\". The creators of the astronomical point in history are The Dixie Duo, Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake, who met at a party in Baltimore, Maryland in 1915. Their career was brief but successful. \\"Shuffle Along was a milestone in the development of the black musical, and it became the model by which all black musicals were judged until well into the 1930s.\\"Woll, Black Musical Theater, pg. 73. F. E. Miller and Aubrey Lyles, who wrote the book for Shuffle Along (1921) had met in 1906, and began performing at the \\"Pekin Theater Stock Company\\" near Chicago from 1906 to 1909, along with other African American stars such as Harry Lawrence Freeman. In 1921, Miller and Lyles appeared in a short film made in Photokinema, a sound-on-disc process, singing their composition \\"De Ducks\\", while Sissle and Blake made three films in the Lee De Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film process in 1923. These short films are a record of music similar to the work these four men were doing on stage at the time...  Rang Tang  Rang Tang was premiered July 12, 1927, on Broadway at the Royale Theater and ran for 119 performances, including a 14-week overrun, finishing at the Majestic October 24, 1927. Lew Leslie's Blackbirds In 1928, white producer and director Lew Leslie staged the first of a popular series of Blackbirds revues, featuring such talents as singers Adelaide Hall and Aida Ward, dancer extraordinaire Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson and top-flight funnyman Tim Moore. Further Blackbirds revues were staged in 1930 with Ethel Waters and Flournoy Miller, in 1933 with Edith Wilson, and in 1939 with Lena Horne and Tim Moore. The key to Leslie‚Äôs success was the exceptional talent he found. ‚ÄúLeslie managed to build his black revues around one or more dynamic performers, who could carry a modest show to success.‚ÄùWoll, Black Musical Theater, pg. 98. Although these productions showcased black talent, they were almost completely created by white writers and composers. In an interview, Leslie made a remarkable claim that ‚ÄúThey (white men) understand the colored man better than he does himself. Colored composers excel at spirituals, but their other songs are just 'what' (dialect for 'white') songs with Negro words.\\"Woll, Black Musical Theater, pg. 97. Porgy and Bess, the WPA, The Swing Mikado, and Carmen Jones George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (1935) ‚Äì starring Will Marion Cook's wife Abbie Mitchell among many others ‚Äì is the most famous black musical of the 1930s. It is called a black musical because of the African American cast, even though neither the music or plot is of the ‚ÄúNegro inspiration‚Äù like the creators proclaim. \\"Porgy and Bess marked the nadir in the history of black musical comedy, symbolizing the end of tradition and experimentation in black musical theater on Broadway\\".Woll, Black Musical Theater, pg. 175. This also led the Works Progress Administration to start the Federal Theater Project that established the Negro Unit with programs in 22 cities. This gave a new break to the struggling artists. The Negro Unit avoided musical comedies, but had a few musicals with black cast including Eubie Blake‚Äôs Swing It, which closed in 1937 and lessened hope for the Federal Theater Project. However, one black musical comedy succeeded and twisted the new realm of musical theater, The Swing Mikado (1937), a \\"modernization\\" of Gilbert and Sullivan‚Äôs classic operetta, The Mikado. This was followed by The Hot Mikado (1939).Woll, Black Musical Theater, pp. 178‚Äì184. Another modern version of the classics was Oscar Hammerstein II's Broadway musical Carmen Jones (1943), a version of Georges Bizet‚Äôs Carmen with an all-black cast.Woll, Black Musical Theater, pg. 189.

Piblokto is a culture-specific hysterical reaction in Inuit, especially women, who may perform irrational or dangerous acts, followed by amnesia for the event. Piblokto may be linked to repression of the personality of Inuit women.Segen's Medical Dictionary. (2012). Farlex, Inc. Pibloktoq The condition appears most commonly in winter.Taylor, S., Shelor, N., & Abdelnour, M. (1972). Nutritional ecology: a new perspective. It is considered to be a form of a culture-bound syndrome, although more recent studies (see Skepticism section) question whether it exists at all. Piblokto is also part of the glossary of cultural bound syndromes found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).. History Piblokto was first documented in 1892 and reports by European explorers describe the phenomenon as common to all Arctic regions. Explorers were the first to notice piblokto. Among these, Admiral Robert Peary provided a detailed look into the disorder during an expedition to Greenland. The acts Peary and his men witnessed among the Inuit women provided entertainment, and, having sent the women's male counterparts out on missions, Peary's men reaped the sexual benefits of being the only males present. Piblokto is not limited to the indigenous people; reports of stranded sailors during the 1800s exhibiting the same symptoms have been found. The disorder is said to have existed before Western contact and still occurs today. However, as discussed below, many scholars now hold that culture bound disorders may often be an artifact of colonial encounters, and contemporary discussions of piblokto in medical anthropology and cross- cultural psychiatry consider it to be an example of the suspect nature of culture bound syndromes. Origin Piblokto is most often found in but not confined to the Inughuit culture in the polar regions of northern Greenland. Similar symptoms have been reported in European sailors stranded in Arctic regions in the 1800s. Among the Inughuit, the attacks are not considered out of the ordinary. No native theory of the disorder is currently reported. This condition is most often seen in Inughuit women. Piblokto is most common during long Arctic nights. Symptoms Piblokto is an abrupt dissociative episode with four phases: social withdrawal, excitement, convulsions and stupor, and recovery.Fulk, M. (2012) Pibloktoq. In his book Handbook of Cultural Psychiatry, Wen-Shing Tseng provides the following example adapted from Foulks: > Mrs. A is a 30-year-old woman who has had periodic episodes of \\"strange > experiences\\" in the past 3 years (since her mother's death). Three years > ago, in the winter, during her first episode, she was acutely assaultive and > tried to harm herself. The attack lasted about 15 min and she remembered > nothing about it afterward. Two years ago, she had her second attack, which > lasted about half an hour, during which time she ran from her home into the > snow, tearing off her clothing. Causes Although there is no known cause for piblokto, Western scientists have attributed the disorder to the lack of sun, the extreme cold, and the desolate state of most villages in the region. A reason for this disorder present in this culture may be due to the isolation of their cultural group.Ephron, Sarah. (July/August 2003) Arctic Hysteria, from Up Here Magazine; archived at SarahEfron.com This culture-bound syndrome is possibly linked to vitamin A toxicity (hypervitaminosis A).Smith, S. (2012, December 6). What is Piblokto? wiseGEEK: clear answers for common questions. Retrieved March 29, 2013. The native Inughuit diet or Eskimo nutrition provides rich sources of vitamin A through the ingestion of livers, kidneys, and fat of arctic fish and mammals and is possibly the cause or a causative factor. This causative factor is through the disturbance that has been reported for males, females, adults, children, and dogs. The ingestion of organ meats, particularly the livers of some Arctic mammals, such as the polar bear and bearded seal, where the vitamin is stored in toxic quantities, can be fatal to most people. Inughuit tradition states that it is caused by evil spirits possessing the living. Shamanism and animism are dominant themes in Inughuit traditional beliefs with the angakkuq (healer) acting as a mediator with the supernatural forces. Angakkuit use trance states to communicate with spirits and carry out faith healing. There is a view among the Inughuit that individuals entering trance states should be treated with respect given the possibility of a new \\"revelation\\" emerging as a result. Treatment in piblokto cases usually involves allowing the episode to run its course without interference. While piblokto can often be confused with other conditions, (including epilepsy) in which failure to intervene can lead to the victim coming to harm, most cases tend to be more typical. Skepticism Although piblokto has a place in the historical record and official medical canons, a number of Arctic researchers and Arctic residents doubt its existence. The phenomena, they suggest, may be more rooted in the experience and behavior of the early European explorers than the Inuit themselves. In 1988 Parks Canada historian Lyle Dick began a substantial challenge to the concept that piblokto exists at all. Dick examined the original records of the European Arctic explorers, and ethnographic and linguistic reports on Inughuit societies, and discovered that not only is the majority of academic speculation into piblokto based on reports of only eight cases, but the word \\"piblokto\\" / \\"pibloktoq\\" does not exist within Inuktun (the Inughuit language); possibly, Dick concluded, this may have been the result of errors in phonetic transcription. In a 1995 paper published in the journal Arctic Anthropology, and in his 2001 book Muskox land: Ellesmere Island in the Age of Contact, Dick suggests that piblokto is a \\"phantom phenomenon\\", arising more from the Inuhuit reaction to European explorers in their midst. Similarly, Hughes and Simons have described piblokto as a \\"catch-all rubric under which explorers lumped various Inuhuit anxiety reactions, expressions of resistance to patriarchy or sexual coercion, and shamanistic practice\\". Simply put, rather than understanding piblokto as a strange cultural phenomenon, some critical scholars now understand it to be an expression of trauma of colonial violence, including rape. For example, transcultural psychiatry scholar Laurence Kirmayer writes: See also * Menerik (ru) (sometimes meryachenieAlso spelled as meriachenie, meryacheniye, meryachenye, meriachen'e, meryachen'e, meriachenye, as well as emiryachenie, emiryachenye, emiriachen'e, emeryachenye, emeriachen'e, emiryachen'e, emiriachenie, emeryachenie.) ‚Äì a condition similar to piblokto found in Siberia among Yakuts, Yukagirs, and Evenks. Sidorov and Davydov draw a distinction between piblokto-like menerik and latah-like meryachenie. Others use meryachenie as an umbrella term for both piblokto-like and latah-like states. * Culture-bound syndrome Notes References Further reading Higgs, Rachel D.

The Parable of the Mustard Seed is one of the shorter parables of Jesus. It appears in Matthew (13:31‚Äì32), Mark (4:30‚Äì32), and Luke (13:18‚Äì19). In the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, it is immediately followed by the Parable of the Leaven, which shares this parable's theme of the Kingdom of Heaven growing from small beginnings. It also appears in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas (verse 20).  Narrative  In the Gospel of Matthew the parable is as follows:... In the Gospel of Mark: In the Gospel of Luke: In the non-canonical gospel of Thomas: Interpretation black mustard plant. The plant referred to here (Greek œÉŒØŒΩŒ±œÄŒπ, sinapi) is generally considered to be black mustard, a large annual plant up to tall,I. Howard Marshall, The Gospel of Luke: A commentary on the Greek text, Eerdmans, 1978, , pp. 561. but growing from a proverbially small seed (this smallness is also used to refer to faith in Matthew 17:20 and Luke 17:6). According to rabbinical sources, Jews did not grow the plant in gardens, and this is consistent with Matthew's description of it growing in a field. Luke tells the parable with the plant in a garden instead; this is presumably recasting the story for an audience outside the Levant. I. Howard Marshall writes that the parable \\"suggests the growth of the kingdom of God from tiny beginnings to worldwide size.\\" The Parable of the Leaven (which in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke immediately follows) shares this theme of large growth from small beginnings. As with the Parable of the Sower, which in Matthew and Mark occurs earlier in the same chapter, the man sowing the seed represents Jesus,John Nolland, The Gospel of Matthew: A commentary on the Greek text, Eerdmans, 2005, , p. 551. and the plant is the Kingdom of God. New Testament scholar, Adolf J√ºlicher, viewed the parable of the mustard seed as a similitude, or an extended simile/metaphor, that has three parts: a picture part (Bildh√§lfte), a reality part (Sachh√§lfte), and a point of comparison (teritium comparationis). The picture part is the mustard seed that grows into a large plant, the reality part is the kingdom of God, and the point of comparison is the growth of the kingdom from small beginnings.Adolf J√ºlicher, Die Gleichnisreden Jesu, 2nd ed.

However, a real mustard plant is unlikely to attract nesting birds, so that \\"Jesus seems deliberately to emphasize the notion of astonishing extravagance in his analogy.\\" Other commentators have suggested that the birds represent Gentiles seeking refuge with IsraelRichard N. Longenecker, The Challenge of Jesus' Parables, Eerdmans, 2000, , p. 141.Michael F. Bird, Jesus and the Origins of the Gentile Mission, Continuum, 2006, , pp. 73‚Äì77. or the \\"sinners\\" and tax collectors with whom Jesus was criticised for associating. A few commentators view the birds negatively, as representing false teachers invading the church.Herbert Lockyer, All the Parables of the Bible, Zondervan, 1988, , p. 188. Some have identified a \\"subversive and scandalous\\" element to this parable, in that the fast-growing nature of the mustard plant makes it a \\"malignant weed\\" with \\"dangerous takeover properties\\". Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History (published around AD 78) writes that \\"mustard... is extremely beneficial for the health. It grows entirely wild, though it is improved by being transplanted: but on the other hand when it has once been sown it is scarcely possible to get the place free of it, as the seed when it falls germinates at once.\\"Pliny the Elder, Natural History, translated by Harris Rackham, Loeb, 1950, Book XIX, Chapter LIV. Ben Witherington notes that Jesus could have chosen a genuine tree for the parable, and that the mustard plant demonstrates that \\"Though the dominion appeared small like a seed during Jesus' ministry, it would inexorably grow into something large and firmly rooted, which some would find shelter in and others would find obnoxious and try to root out.\\"Ben Witherington, The Gospel of Mark: A socio-rhetorical commentary, Eerdmans, 2001, , pp. 171‚Äì172.  Criticism  Technically, the mustard seed is not the smallest seed, not even among agriculturally used plants. For instance, orchids have smaller seeds, including those of vanilla, which is consumed by humans. Some bible translations thus use different statements, even though the original Greek is quite explicit on mustard seeds being the smallest.

Robert Lundy (fl. 1689) (died 1717), was a Scottish army officer best known for serving as Governor of Londonderry during the early stages of the Siege of Derry. Early career Lundy was born in Dumbarton and raised in the Church of Scotland. He pursued a military career, serving in the Earl of Dumbarton's regiment in the French Army of Louis XIV. He had risen to rank of Captain when the regiment returned to Scotland in 1678 where it was renamed the Royal Scots. Lundy continued to serve with the regiment when it was sent out to reinforce the Tangier Garrison. In October 1680 he was wounded during a battle with the local Moroccan forces during the Great Siege of Tangier. He married an Irish wife, Martha Davies, whose father, Rowland Davies, became later the Dean of Cork,B. H. Blacker & William Gibson, Davies, Rowland (1649‚Äì1721), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and through her family connections was able to secure promotion to Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Irish Army. In 1688 he was at Dublin in the regiment of Viscount Mountjoy. Siege of Derry However, in 1685 Charles II died and James II succeeded. In 1687 he replaced Ormonde with Richard Talbot and introduced a policy of replacing Protestant officers with Catholic ones in the Irish Army. Mountjoy was one of few Protestants remaining in the army and he could protect his Protestant soldiers and officers, such as Lundy. The Apprentice Boys of Derry shut the gates of the city against \\"a regiment of twelve hundred Papists, commanded by a Papist, Alexander Macdonnell, Earl of Antrim\\", who hastily withdrew his small force. Later, the Viceroy solicited intervention by Mountjoy and finally dispatched a strong but poorly disciplined Irish force commanded by Sir Richard Hamilton to march north against the Protestants. A stratagem prepared by Mountjoy and Lundy to assume control of Derry succeeded in embedding a small garrison of predominantly Protestant troops under the command first of Mountjoy then of Lundy, who assumed the title of governor.Graham, Rev John A History of the Siege of Londonderry Maclear & Co, Toronto 1869. P.13 et seq However, popular feeling in Derry ran so strongly in favour of the Prince of Orange that Lundy declared himself an adherent of King William III, and he obtained from him a commission confirming his appointment as Williamite governor of Derry. From December 1688 to March 1689 Lundy had the walls and the gates repaired to protect the city, refitted gun carriages and musket stocks, removed buildings and dungheaps outside the walls which might provide cover to besiegers, purchased powder, cannonballs and matchlocks, and had a protective ravelin and outworks built.Apprentice Boys: Is Robert Lundy much maligned?, The Belfast News Letter, 31 January 2013 Lundy's motivation cannot certainly be known. What is certain is that from the moment Derry was threatened by the troops of King James, Lundy used all his endeavours to paralyse the defence of the city. In April 1689 he was in command of a force of Protestants who encountered some troops under Richard Hamilton at Strabane, when, instead of holding his ground, he told his men that all was lost and ordered them to shift for themselves; he himself was the first to take flight back to Derry. King James, then at Omagh on his way to the north, similarly turned in flight towards Dublin on hearing of the skirmish, but returned next day on receiving the true account of the occurrence. Macaulay, T. B. https://archive.org/stream/jamessecondsdesc00maca#page/42/mode/2up James the Second's Descent on Ireland], p.42 et seq On 14 April English ships appeared in the Foyle with reinforcements for Lundy under Colonel John Cunningham and Solomon Richards. Lundy dissuaded Cunningham from landing his regiments, representing that a defence of Derry was hopeless; and that he himself intended to withdraw secretly from the city. At the same time he sent to the enemy's headquarters a promise to surrender the city at the first summons. As soon as this became known to the citizens, Lundy's life was in danger, and he was vehemently accused of treachery. When the enemy appeared before the walls, Lundy gave orders that there should be no firing. But all authority had passed out of his hands. The people flew to arms under the direction of Major Henry Baker and Captain Adam Murray, who organised the famous defence in conjunction with the Rev. George Walker. Lundy, to avoid popular vengeance, hid himself until nightfall when, by the connivance of Walker and Murray, he made his escape in disguise.Graham, Rev John A History of the Siege of Londonderry Maclear & Co, Toronto 1869. P.49 traditional effigy of Robert Lundy in Derry prior to being burnt by the Apprentice Boys Later life He was apprehended in western Scotland, imprisoned at Dumbarton Castle, and then sent to the Tower of London. He was excluded from the Act of Indemnity in 1690. An effort was made to send him for trial at Derry, but this was argued against because it was evident that Lundy still retained the support of influential people there. As Reverend George Walker described this, \\"he had a faction for him\\" in the town.Macrory, Patrick, \\"The Siege of Derry\\". London (1980), p.192. After an enquiry in London he was \\"cleared of charges of treason\\" and returned to military service. From 1704 to 1712 he was \\"Adjudent-General of the King of Portugal's forces in the Queen of England's pay\\" during the War of Spanish SuccessionMacrory, Patrick, \\"The Siege of Derry\\" London (1980), p.192. where he defended Gibraltar against the French.Simms, J.G. Jacobite Ireland, London (1969)p. 101 In 1707 he was captured by the French, but was exchanged a year later.Childs p.71 Legacy Lundy is reviled in Ulster loyalism as a traitor to this day, and is burned in effigy during the celebrations to mark the anniversary of the shutting of the gates of Derry in 1688. Much like Judas, his name has become a byword for \\"traitor\\" among unionists and loyalists. Ian Paisley regularly denounced people, including Margaret Thatcher, Terence O'Neill and David Trimble, as \\"Lundies\\". Notes and references  *  Bibliography  * Childs, John.

The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system.

In order to comply with state and federal laws, the District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. South Allegheny School District received a $1,056,378 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 100 or 06.27% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student‚Äôs building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying and safety In 2009 the administrative reported there were 24 incidents of bullying in the district. The South Allegheny School Board prohibits bullying by district students and faculty. The policy defines bullying and cyberbullying. The Board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. The board expects staff members to be responsible to maintain an educational environment free from all forms of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget In 2007, the district employed 117 teachers.

The use of these funds is strictly focused on specific state approved uses. South Allegheny School District uses its $360,579 to fund all-day kindergarten. These annual funds are in addition to the state's basic education funding. The 2008-09 school year was the fifth year the district offered all-day kindergarten to its pupils. Schools Districts apply each year for Accountability Block Grants. In 2009-10 the state provided $271.4 million in Accountability Block grants $199.5 million went to providing all-day kindergartens. Classrooms for the Future Grants In 2007, South Allegheny, applied for and received a grant from the PA Department of Education for over $180,000 to purchase equipment to help reform the high school's core subjects instruction and to prepare students for future employment by using cutting-edge equipment and software. The district used the funds to purchase 196 laptops for students, 8 laptops for teachers, laptop carts and other digital equipment. The district also received $6000 in funds to upgrade our existing network infrastructure. The grant provided additional funding for a technology coach to instruct teachers in using the equipment to improve instruction. In 2008, the district received an additional $43,413 for computers and related equipment. Since 2006, Pennsylvania's Classrooms for the Future program has distributed more than $150 million for laptops, interactive boards and other high-tech tools in 543 high schools. In 2009 the state funding program was terminated due to a deep state budget shortfall.Governor Rendell Signs Education Budget Preserving Pennsylvania's Academic Progress, Keeping Property Taxes Down, Governor's Press Office release, October 9, 2009 Education Assistance grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11 the South Allegheny School District received $43,377. =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received an extra $1,727,534 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding is for 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years. =Race to the Top grant= School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant. When approved for the grant, the district would have received over one million in additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved in the first round of the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. A second round of state RTTT application judging will occur in June 2010. =Enrollment and Consolidation= In 2009, a proposal was made by David Wassell, a prominent resident and leader in Allegheny County, to consolidate Allegheny County school districts to save tax dollars and improve student services. The proposal is that South Allegheny School District join with Elizabeth Forward School District. A Standard & Poor's study found that an optimal school district size, to conserve administrative costs, was 3000 pupils. Consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in both communities. Governor Edward Rendell proposed that consolidation with adjacent school districts, in each county, would achieve substantial cost savings. The savings could be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. Consolidation of two central administrations into one administration would not require the closing of any local schools. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any school buildings. The study noted that while the best school districts spent 4% of the annual budget on administration, others spend over 15% on administration. On June 29, 2011, Rep Marc J. Gergely predicted the district will be forced to consolidate with its neighboring district, in the next few years, based in the current state funding of the district.Pennsylvania House of Representatives debate on the 2011-12 Commonwealth General Fund Budget - Comments by Rep. Marc J. Gergely on rejecting general fund budget, June 29, 2011 More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater). Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools. =Real estate taxes= For the 2011-12 school year, the South Allegheny School Board set the real estate tax rate at 18.4900 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. The most recent assessed values for all properties in Allegheny County are available at the Allegheny County Office of Property Assessments. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75‚Äì85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2009-10 - 18.110 mills *2008-09 - 18.1100 mills. *2007-08 - 18.11 mills *2006-07 - 18.11 mills On June 20, 2007, the Board of Directors of the South Allegheny School District adopted a plan for providing an option for installment payments of real estate taxes on approved Homestead and Farmstead Property pursuant to the Taxpayer Relief Act (Act 1 of 2006). Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010‚Äì11 school year is 2.9 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. The School District Adjusted Index for the South Allegheny School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 5.8%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 5.1%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.6%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 6.2%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.4%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 2.1%, Base 1.4% For the 2011‚Äì12 school year the South Allegheny School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the South Allegheny School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì12 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district‚Äôs index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. For 2009 and 2010, the School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Index limit. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, property tax relief was set at $207 for the 3,667 approved homesteads. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the South Allegheny School District was $209 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 3,641 property owners applied for the property tax relief. In 2010 and 2009, the highest property tax relief in Allegheny County goes to Duquesne City School District at $348. The highest property tax relief, among Pennsylvania school districts, went to the residents of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County who received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. This was the second year they received this amount. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Allegheny County, 60% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Wellness policy South Allegheny School Board adopted a district wide Student Wellness Policy 246 in 2006.South Allegheny School Board Policy Manual Policy 246 adopted June 21, 2006 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy.. By Pennsylvania law, all K‚Äì12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. Beginning with the 2011‚Äì12 school year the board has determined that students will pay a fee to participate in extracurriculars. For interscholastic athletics the fee was set at $75 per season, per athlete, with a student and/or family cap of $225. The band fee was set at $50 per year per participant, with a family cap of $150. Clubs, competitive groups and ensembles cost $25 per student.

Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley type models represent the biophysical characteristic of cell membranes. The lipid bilayer is represented as a capacitance (Cm). Voltage-gated and leak ion channels are represented by nonlinear (gn) and linear (gL) conductances, respectively. The electrochemical gradients driving the flow of ions are represented by batteries (E), and ion pumps and exchangers are represented by current sources (Ip). The Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model, or conductance-based model, is a mathematical model that describes how action potentials in neurons are initiated and propagated. It is a set of nonlinear differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics of excitable cells such as neurons and cardiac myocytes. It is a continuous-time dynamical system. Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley described the model in 1952 to explain the ionic mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of action potentials in the squid giant axon. They received the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work. Basic components The typical Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model treats each component of an excitable cell as an electrical element (as shown in the figure). The lipid bilayer is represented as a capacitance (Cm). Voltage-gated ion channels are represented by electrical conductances (gn, where n is the specific ion channel) that depend on both voltage and time. Leak channels are represented by linear conductances (gL). The electrochemical gradients driving the flow of ions are represented by voltage sources (En) whose voltages are determined by the ratio of the intra- and extracellular concentrations of the ionic species of interest. Finally, ion pumps are represented by current sources (Ip). The membrane potential is denoted by Vm. Mathematically, the current flowing through the lipid bilayer is written as : I_c = C_m\\\\frac{{\\\\mathrm d} V_m}{{\\\\mathrm d} t} and the current through a given ion channel is the product : I_i = {g_i}(V_m - V_i) \\\\; where V_i is the reversal potential of the i-th ion channel. Thus, for a cell with sodium and potassium channels, the total current through the membrane is given by: : I = C_m\\\\frac{{\\\\mathrm d} V_m}{{\\\\mathrm d} t} + g_K(V_m - V_K) + g_{Na}(V_m - V_{Na}) + g_l(V_m - V_l) where I is the total membrane current per unit area, Cm is the membrane capacitance per unit area, gK and gNa are the potassium and sodium conductances per unit area, respectively, VK and VNa are the potassium and sodium reversal potentials, respectively, and gl and Vl are the leak conductance per unit area and leak reversal potential, respectively. The time dependent elements of this equation are Vm, gNa, and gK, where the last two conductances depend explicitly on voltage as well. Ionic current characterization In voltage-gated ion channels, the channel conductance g_l is a function of both time and voltage (g_n(t,V) in the figure), while in leak channels g_l is a constant (g_L in the figure). The current generated by ion pumps is dependent on the ionic species specific to that pump. The following sections will describe these formulations in more detail. =Voltage-gated ion channels= Using a series of voltage clamp experiments and by varying extracellular sodium and potassium concentrations, Hodgkin and Huxley developed a model in which the properties of an excitable cell are described by a set of four ordinary differential equations. Together with the equation for the total current mentioned above, these are: : I = C_m\\\\frac{{\\\\mathrm d} V_m}{{\\\\mathrm d} t} + \\\\bar{g}_\\\\text{K}n^4(V_m - V_K) + \\\\bar{g}_\\\\text{Na}m^3h(V_m - V_{Na}) + \\\\bar{g}_l(V_m - V_l), : \\\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\\\alpha_n(V_m)(1 - n) - \\\\beta_n(V_m) n : \\\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\\\alpha_m(V_m)(1 - m) - \\\\beta_m(V_m) m : \\\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\\\alpha_h(V_m)(1 - h) - \\\\beta_h(V_m) h where I is the current per unit area, and \\\\alpha_i and \\\\beta_i are rate constants for the i-th ion channel, which depend on voltage but not time. \\\\bar{g}_n is the maximal value of the conductance. n, m, and h are dimensionless quantities between 0 and 1 that are associated with potassium channel activation, sodium channel activation, and sodium channel inactivation, respectively. For p = (n, m, h), \\\\alpha_p and \\\\beta_p take the form : \\\\alpha_p(V_m) = p_\\\\infty(V_m)/\\\\tau_p : \\\\beta_p(V_m) = (1 - p_\\\\infty(V_m))/\\\\tau_p. p_\\\\infty and (1-p_\\\\infty) are the steady state values for activation and inactivation, respectively, and are usually represented by Boltzmann equations as functions of V_m. In the original paper by Hodgkin and Huxley, the functions \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are given by : \\\\begin{array}{lll} \\\\alpha_n(V_m) = \\\\frac{0.01(10-V_m )}{\\\\exp\\\\big(\\\\frac{10-V_m}{10}\\\\big)-1} & \\\\alpha_m(V_m) = \\\\frac{0.1(25-V_m)}{\\\\exp\\\\big(\\\\frac{25-V_m}{10}\\\\big)-1} & \\\\alpha_h(V_m) = 0.07\\\\exp\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{-V_m}{20}\\\\bigg)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta_n(V_m) = 0.125\\\\exp\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{-V_m}{80}\\\\bigg) & \\\\beta_m(V_m) = 4\\\\exp\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{-V_m}{18}\\\\bigg) & \\\\beta_h(V_m) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\exp\\\\big(\\\\frac{30-V_m}{10}\\\\big) + 1} \\\\end{array} while in many current software programs,Nelson ME (2005) Electrophysiological Models In: Databasing the Brain: From Data to Knowledge. (S. Koslow and S. Subramaniam, eds.) Wiley, New York, pp. 285‚Äì301 Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley type models generalize \\\\alpha and \\\\beta to : \\\\frac{A_p(V_m-B_p)}{\\\\exp\\\\big(\\\\frac{V_m- B_p}{C_p}\\\\big)-D_p} In order to characterize voltage-gated channels, the equations are fit to voltage clamp data. For a derivation of the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley equations under voltage-clamp, see . Briefly, when the membrane potential is held at a constant value (i.e., voltage-clamp), for each value of the membrane potential the nonlinear gating equations reduce to equations of the form: : m(t) = m_{0} - [ (m_{0}-m_{\\\\infty})(1 - e^{-t/\\\\tau_m})]\\\\, : h(t) = h_{0} - [ (h_{0}-h_{\\\\infty})(1 - e^{-t/\\\\tau_h})]\\\\, : n(t) = n_{0} - [ (n_{0}-n_{\\\\infty})(1 - e^{-t/\\\\tau_n})]\\\\, Thus, for every value of membrane potential V_{m} the sodium and potassium currents can be described by : I_\\\\mathrm{Na}(t)=\\\\bar{g}_\\\\mathrm{Na} m(V_m)^3h(V_m)(V_m-E_\\\\mathrm{Na}), : I_\\\\mathrm{K}(t)=\\\\bar{g}_\\\\mathrm{K} n(V_m)^4(V_m-E_\\\\mathrm{K}). In order to arrive at the complete solution for a propagated action potential, one must write the current term I on the left-hand side of the first differential equation in terms of V, so that the equation becomes an equation for voltage alone. The relation between I and V can be derived from cable theory and is given by : I = \\\\frac{a}{2R}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2V}{\\\\partial x^2}, where a is the radius of the axon, R is the specific resistance of the axoplasm, and x is the position along the nerve fiber. Substitution of this expression for I transforms the original set of equations into a set of partial differential equations, because the voltage becomes a function of both x and t. The Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm is often used to fit these equations to voltage- clamp data. While the original experiments treated only sodium and potassium channels, the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model can also be extended to account for other species of ion channels. =Leak channels= Leak channels account for the natural permeability of the membrane to ions and take the form of the equation for voltage-gated channels, where the conductance g_{leak} is a constant. Thus, the leak current due to passive leak ion channels in the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is I_l=g_{leak}(V-V_{leak}). =Pumps and exchangers= The membrane potential depends upon the maintenance of ionic concentration gradients across it. The maintenance of these concentration gradients requires active transport of ionic species. The sodium-potassium and sodium-calcium exchangers are the best known of these. Some of the basic properties of the Na/Ca exchanger have already been well-established: the stoichiometry of exchange is 3 Na+: 1 Ca2+ and the exchanger is electrogenic and voltage-sensitive. The Na/K exchanger has also been described in detail, with a 3 Na+: 2 K+ stoichiometry. Mathematical properties The Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model can be thought of as a differential equation with four state variables, v(t), m(t), n(t), and h(t), that change with respect to time t. The system is difficult to study because it is a nonlinear system and cannot be solved analytically. However, there are many numeric methods available to analyze the system. Certain properties and general behaviors, such as limit cycles, can be proven to exist. A simulation of the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model in phase space, in terms of voltage v(t) and potassium gating variable n(t). The closed curve is known as a limit cycle. =Center manifold= Because there are four state variables, visualizing the path in phase space can be difficult. Usually two variables are chosen, voltage v(t) and the potassium gating variable n(t), allowing one to visualize the limit cycle. However, one must be careful because this is an ad-hoc method of visualizing the 4-dimensional system. This does not prove the existence of the limit cycle. A better projection can be constructed from a careful analysis of the Jacobian of the system, evaluated at the equilibrium point. Specifically, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian are indicative of the center manifold's existence. Likewise, the eigenvectors of the Jacobian reveal the center manifold's orientation. The Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model has two negative eigenvalues and two complex eigenvalues with slightly positive real parts. The eigenvectors associated with the two negative eigenvalues will reduce to zero as time t increases. The remaining two complex eigenvectors define the center manifold. In other words, the 4-dimensional system collapses onto a 2-dimensional plane. Any solution starting off the center manifold will decay towards the center manifold. Furthermore, the limit cycle is contained on the center manifold. The voltage v(t) (in millivolts) of the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model, graphed over 50 milliseconds. The injected current varies from ‚àí5 nanoamps to 12 nanoamps. The graph passes through three stages: an equilibrium stage, a single-spike stage, and a limit cycle stage. =Bifurcations= If the injected current I were used as a bifurcation parameter, then the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation. As with most neuronal models, increasing the injected current will increase the firing rate of the neuron. One consequence of the Hopf bifurcation is that there is a minimum firing rate. This means that either the neuron is not firing at all (corresponding to zero frequency), or firing at the minimum firing rate. Because of the all-or-none principle, there is no smooth increase in action potential amplitude, but rather there is a sudden \\"jump\\" in amplitude. The resulting transition is known as a canard. Improvements and alternative models The Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model is regarded as one of the great achievements of 20th-century biophysics. Nevertheless, modern Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley-type models have been extended in several important ways: *Additional ion channel populations have been incorporated based on experimental data. *The Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model has been modified to incorporate transition state theory and produce thermodynamic Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley models. *Models often incorporate highly complex geometries of dendrites and axons, often based on microscopy data. *Stochastic models of ion-channel behavior, leading to stochastic hybrid systems. *The Poisson‚ÄìNernst‚ÄìPlanck (PNP) model is based on a mean-field approximation of ion interactions and continuum descriptions of concentration and electrostatic potential. Several simplified neuronal models have also been developed (such as the FitzHugh‚ÄìNagumo model), facilitating efficient large- scale simulation of groups of neurons, as well as mathematical insight into dynamics of action potential generation.

The treaty was first signed in 1951 at the San Francisco Presidio after the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco (commonly known as the Peace Treaty of San Francisco) at the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House. Then, the Security Treaty was amended further in January 1960 between the US and Japan in Washington, DC. When the treaty was first signed, it contained provisions that permitted the United States to act to maintain peace in East Asia and even to exert its power on Japanese domestic quarrels. The latter part mentioned has been deleted in the revised version of the treaty. In the amended treaty, articles that delineate mutual defense obligations and the US obligations to inform Japan before US forces mobilized were included to alleviate unequal status suggested in the 1952 treaty. The treaty established that any attack against Japan or the United States perpetrated within Japanese territorial administration would be dangerous to both countries' peace and safety. It required both countries to act to meet the common danger. To support that requirement, it provided for the continued presence of US military bases in Japan. The treaty also included general provisions on the further development of international cooperation and improved future economic cooperation.http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/japan/mutual_cooperation_treaty.pdf The treaty has lasted longer than any other alliance between two great powers since the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. The treaty had a minimum term of 10 years but provided that it would remain in force permanently unless one party gives one year's notice of wishing to terminate it. Background Major US military bases in Japan US military bases in Okinawa Prefecture The earlier Security Treaty of 1951 provided the initial basis for the Japan's security relations with the United States and was signed after Japan had regained full sovereignty at the end of the allied occupation. Bilateral talks on revising the 1951 treaty began in 1959, and the new Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security was signed in Washington on 19 January 1960. When the pact was submitted to the Japanese Diet for ratification on February 5, it became the subject of bitter debate over Japanese-American relations and the occasion for violence in an all-out effort by leftists to prevent its passage. The treaty was finally approved by the Japanese House of Representatives on 20 May. Japan Socialist Party deputies boycotted the lower house session, tried to prevent the Liberal Democratic Party deputies from entering the chamber, and were forcibly removed by the police. Massive demonstrations and rioting by students and trade unions followed. The outbursts prevented a scheduled visit to Japan by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower and precipitated the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi but not before the treaty had passed by default on June 19, when the House of Councillors failed to vote on the issue within the required 30 days after the House of Representatives had approved the treaty. Opposition was largely based on the argument that Article 6 of the treaty threatens the sovereign power of Japan since, as further explained below, it contains a Status of Forces Agreement that allows the US to use military forces and facilities deployed in Japan for combat other than for the defense of Japan. Terms In Article 1, the treaty began by establishing that each country would seek to resolve any international disputes peacefully. The treaty also gave prominence to the United Nations in dealing with aggression. Article 5, which dealt with armed attacks by a third party, required for the UN Security Council to be involved and that any measures taken by the US and Japan to be ceased \\"when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.\\" Also, Article 10 allowed for the abrogation of the treaty if both parties agreed that the United Nations has made satisfactory arrangements to provide for the stability of peace and security in the Japan area: if and when the system of collective security went into effect. Under the treaty, both parties assumed an obligation to maintain and to develop their capacities to resist armed attack in common and to assist each other during armed attack on territories under Japanese administration. It was understood, however, that Japan could not come to the defense of the United States because it was constitutionally forbidden to send armed forces overseas by Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan, which forbids the maintenance of \\"land, sea, and air forces\\" and expresses the Japanese people's renunciation of \\"the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.\\" The scope of the new treaty did not extend to the Ryukyu Islands, but an appended minute clarified that during an armed attack on the islands, both governments would consult and take appropriate action. Unlike the 1951 security pact, the new treaty provided for a ten-year term after which it could be revoked upon one year's notice by either party. Article 6 of the treaty contained a Status of Forces Agreement on the stationing of United States Forces Japan, with specifics on the provision of facilities and areas for their use and on the administration of Japanese citizens employed in the facilities. The agreed minutes to the treaty specified that the Japanese government would be consulted prior to major changes in United States force deployment in Japan or to the use of Japanese bases for combat operations other than to defend Japan itself. Also covered were the limits of both countries' jurisdictions over crimes committed in Japan by US military personnel. Aftermath The Mutual Security Assistance Pact of 1954 initially involved a military aid program that provided for Japan's acquisition of funds, materiel and services for the nation's essential defense. Although Japan had no longer received any aid from the United States by the 1960s, the agreement continued to serve as the basis for purchase and licensing agreements ensuring interoperability of both nations' weapons and for the release of classified data to Japan, including international intelligence reports and classified technical information. There were other widespread protests in Japan when the pact was renewed in 1970, but they died down thereafter. Further, there was a shift in Japanese domestic politics. Nobusuke Kishi had to resign as prime minister and succumbed to widespread demonstrations against the treaty and the US in general. He was succeeded by Hayato Ikeda. Opposition In May and June 1960, mass demonstrations took place outside the Diet building, opposing forced adoption of the revised treaty in 1960. An umbrell organization, People's Council to Stop the Revised Security Treaty (ÂÆâ‰øùÊù°Á¥ÑÊîπÂÆöÈòªÊ≠¢ÂõΩÊ∞ë‰ºöË≠∞, Anpo J≈çyaku Kaitei Soshi Kokumin Kaigi), co-ordinated the actions of various citizen movements involved in opposing the revision. It formed with 134 organizations as members in March 1959 and grew to have 1,633 affiliated organizations by March 1960. The groups included labor unions, farmers' and teachers' unions, poetry circles, theater troupes, student and women's organizations, mothers' groups, and groups affiliated with the Japan Socialist Party and the Japan Communist Party. A University of Tokyo undergraduate and student activist, Michiko Kanba, died in clashes between protestors and police at the South Gate of the Diet Building in the evening of 15 June 1960. 1960 protests against the United States-Japan Security Treaty A central issue in the debate over the continued US military presence is the concentration of troops in the small Japanese prefecture of Okinawa. US military bases cover about one fifth of Okinawa and serve around 75% of the US forces in Japan (Packard, 2010, Sumida, 2009). That has left many Okinawans feeling that the security agreement may be beneficial to the United States and Japan as a whole, but it is burdensome to the residents of the small subtropical island. Another contentious issue to many Okinawans is the noise and environmental pollution created by the US forces in Japan. Excessive noise lawsuits in 2009 filed by Okinawa's residents against Kadena Air Base and MCAS Futenma resulted in awards of $59 million and $1.3 million to residents, respectively (Sumida, 2009). The tourist attraction of Okinawa's coral reef has suffered from continuous runoff of live fire exercises from the military bases (JCP, 2000). The most powerful opposition in Okinawa, however, stemmed from criminal acts committed by US servicemembers and their dependents, with the latest example being the 1995 kidnapping and molestation of a 12-year-old Okinawan girl by two Marines and a Navy corpsmen (Packard, 2010). In early 2008, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice apologized after a series of crimes involving American troops in Japan, including the rape of a girl of 14 by a marine on Okinawa. The US military also imposed a temporary 24-hour curfew on military personnel and their families to ease the anger of local residents. Some media cited statistics that the crime rate of military personnel was consistently less than that of the general Okinawan population. In a 2006 agreement between the George W. Bush administration and the Japanese government, MCAS Futenma was to be relocated to the northern Okinawa city of Nago, and 8,000 Marines and their dependents were to be relocated to Guam (Packard, 2010). The agreement, however, received very little support from Okinawans. After spending several months deliberating over the new location of the base would move, Yukio Hatoyama conceded to allow the original agreement to go forward and immediately resigned after he stated that he had failed to fulfill one of his promises. Support Despite the strong Okinawan opposition to the US military presence on the island, there was also strong support for the agreement. Fear of a new imperialistic Japan made its lawmakers forbid the maintaining of more than a self-defense forces when they drafted the postwar Constitution. As a result, Japan has never spent more than 1% of its GDP on military expenditures (Englehardt, 2010). In return for allowing the US military presence in Japan, the United States agrees to help defend Japan against any foreign adversaries, such as North Korea. In addition to military support, the military presence in Okinawa contributes to the economy of Japan's poorest prefecture. As of 2004, 8,813 locals worked on bases, in addition to numerous others who worked in shops and bars in which the main customer base is US service members. Altogether, the US presence accounts for about 5% of the Okinawan economy (Fukumura, 2007). According to a 2007 Okinawa Times poll, 73.4% of Japanese citizens appreciated the mutual security treaty with the US and the presence of US forces.Ëá™Ë°õÈöä„ÉªÈò≤Ë°õÂïèÈ°å„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„Çã‰∏ñË´ñË™øÊüª , The Cabinet Office of Japan Coverage In 2012, the US clarified in a statement over the dispute over the Senkaku Islands that the treaty covers the islands and requires the Americans to defend them. In April 2014, US President Barack Obama declared unequivocally that the islands would be covered by the treaty in the event of an armed attack on them. That was the first time a sitting US president made an explicit commitment and was intended to reassure the government of Japan. On 19 April 2019, Japan and the United States confirmed that cyberattacks are also covered by the treaty. Defense co- operation will increase for outer space warfare, cyberwarfare and electronic warfare.

Although some say that his middle name Xin was spelled as Singh due to mainstream Nepalese or Indian influence, others say Singh is correct because in his book Kiratakalina Vijayapurako Sankshipta Itihasa, Chemjong writes his name in Nepali as Iman Singh Chemjong. Chemjong devoted his entire life to studying and documenting various facets of Kirat Limbu tradition and culture at a time when such activities were frowned upon and even punished by the Nepalese ruling elite as being subversive and \\"anti-national\\". Chemjong's research into, and publication of, a Kiranti history and culture challenged perceptions of the Nepalese official doctrine that showcased Nepal as a Hindu cultural monolith devoid of alternative narratives. Born in Renkebung village of Darjeeling district, West Bengal, India, Chemjong received his education at St. Xavier's College, then under the University of Calcutta. In 1928, he completed his certificate level and was about to enroll for a Bachelor degree, when his father, Megbar Singh Chemjong, died. Chemjong junior had to put his academic aspirations on hold. Early influences Traditionally, Limbus observed a religion called Mundhum centred on animistic rituals and practices. However, due to assimilation of Limbus into the Hindu mainstream, many Limbus adopted Hindu names and started to participate in Hindu worships and festivals. Limbus never really severed their ties to their rich religion and culture that stretched back to ancient times. Alongside Hindu goddesses Durga and Laxmi, Limbus continued to worship their own supreme god Ningmaphuma. One such devoted Limbu worshipper was Chemjong's own mother, Devapu Hangma. Limbu Mundum religion is a rich cornucopia of oral traditions encompassing Kirati theology, mythology, history, genealogy, culture and traditions, and having a devout mother gave Chemjong a distinct advantage to learn all these. A turning point in Chemjong's life came in 1925, when the legendary Limbu activist Lalshore Sendang visited Kalimpong in Darjeeling district and met Limbu elders and activists. Chemjong was one of the many Limbu youths who learned the Limbu Sirijonga script from Sendang and attended his talks on Limbu religion and culture. Works Chemjong researched Limbu language and culture in Limbuwan, i.e. East Nepal, the neighbouring hill areas of Darjeeling and Sikkim (then an independent Himalayan kingdom) and also in Assam. In his own lifetime, he published the following works:http://chumlung.org.np/page.php?page=11 *Kirat Itihas 1948 *Kirat Sahityako Itihas 1955 *Kirat Folklore 1961 *Kirat Mundhum 1961 *Limboo-Nepali-English Dictionary 1961 *Kirat Mundhum Khahun 1965 *Kirat History and Culture 1967 *Kirat Darshanko Saransh 1969 *Lepcha-Nepali-English Dictionary 1969 *Bijayapurko Itihas 1974 Recognition In a gesture that went against the grain of prevailing state ideology, King Mahendra invited Chemjong to join Nepal's Tribhuvan University in the capacity of \\"Limbu expert\\" in 1961. For years until his death, Chemjong headed a one-man Limbu research team at the then Nepal's only university. Chemjong appears to have held a \\"Kirant Bhasha Tatha Sanskriti Bishesagya (Specialist in Kiranti Language and Culture)\\" position at the Tribhuwan University, Kirtipur, Kathmandu as evidenced by his title in his book Kiratakalina Vijayapurako Sankshipta Itihasa published in 1975 and not as \\"Limbu expert\\". Today, the Limbu community spread across mid- and eastern Nepal, West Bengal, Assam, Sikkim and Bhutan revere Chemjong as a hero for almost single-handedly researching and documenting various aspects of Limbu and Kirati life at a time when such activities were neither encouraged nor fashionable. Various functions are held each year to commemorate Chemjong's contributions.http://isikkim.com/107th-birth-anniversary-of-iman-chemjong/ Chemjong is survived by his wife, Amiran Chemjong, two daughters, three sons and nine grandchildren.

He spent most of his career with Benfica, appearing in 525 official matches and scoring 127 goals during 16 professional seasons. Dubbed O Monstro Sagrado (The Sacred Monster), he won 19 major titles with his main club, including ten national leagues and two European Cups. Coluna represented Portugal at the 1966 World Cup and earned a total of 57 caps. He was considered one of the best midfielders of his generation, also being viewed as one of the most talented Portuguese players of all time. Club career Born in Inhaca, Portuguese Mozambique, to a Portuguese father and a Mozambican mother, Coluna was spotted by S.L. Benfica while playing for Desportivo de Louren√ßo Marques, where he excelled at basketball and track and field. Signed by the Lisbon club in 1954, he started playing as an inside forward, scoring a career-best 14 goals in 26 games in his first season in Portugal and winning the first of his Primeira Liga championships; subsequently, he was successfully reconverted as a central or attacking midfielder by manager Otto Gl√≥ria, where he put to good use his stamina and strength, adding to this an accurate and powerful long-distance shot and technical skills. Coluna captained Benfica from 1963 to 1970, in 328 matches. Already at the service of Olympique Lyonnais, he was awarded a testimonial match by his main club on 8 December 1970, playing against a UEFA selection that featured the likes of Johan Cruyff, Dragan D≈æajiƒá, Geoff Hurst, Bobby Moore, Uwe Seeler or Luis Su√°rez. He retired professionally at the age of 35, after one sole campaign with the French side ‚Äì he still spent one year with amateurs Sport Clube Estrela from Portalegre, acting as player-coach. Coluna scored in both European Cup finals won by Benfica: in 1961, he beat FC Barcelona's Antoni Ramallets from long range in a 3‚Äì2 win in Bern. The following year, against fellow Spaniards Real Madrid, he netted the 3‚Äì3 equaliser and, subsequently, was supposed to take the penalty that resulted in the 4‚Äì3 lead (eventual 5‚Äì3 triumph), when youngster Eus√©bio politely asked if he could shoot it instead. International career Coluna played 57 times for the Portugal national team, scoring eight goals. His first appearance was in a friendly with Scotland on 4 May 1955 (0‚Äì3 loss), and his last on 11 December 1968 in a 4‚Äì2 defeat in Greece for the 1970 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Coluna captained the Magri√ßos side in all except one of the matches during the third- place campaign at the 1966 World Cup, in England. Post-retirement / Death After Mozambique became independent in 1975, Coluna held the post of President of its Football Federation. He also served as the country's Minister of Sports, from 1994 to 1999. Coluna died on 25 February 2014 at the age of 78 in Maputo, after not being able to overcome a pulmonary infection.

It is also known as the Asian water dragon, Thai water dragon, and green water dragon. Description Chinese water dragons can grow up to in total length, including tail, and can live from 10 to 15 years. Coloration ranges from dark to light green, or sometimes purple with an orange stomach. Diagonal stripes of green or turquoise are found on the body, while the tail is banded from the middle to the end with green and white. Their undersides range from white, off white, very pale green, or pale yellow. But their throats are considered to be more attractive, which can be quite colorful (blue and purple, or peach), some with a single color, some with stripes. Adult males have larger, more triangular heads than females, and develop larger crests on the head, neck and tail, and are larger in general. The tail, slightly over two-thirds of the entire body length, can be used as a weapon, for balance, and to assist swimming. Like many other reptiles the Chinese water dragon possesses a small, iridescent, photosensitive spot between their eyes referred to as the pineal eye (or parietal eye, or colloquially as the third eye) that is thought to help thermoregulate their bodies by sensing differences in light to assist with basking and seeking shelter after sunset. Since it recognizes differences in light, the parietal eye can also help the lizard avoid predation from birds and other aerial threats, and can awaken from deep sleep from even slight changes in light from overhead. These animals are very docile and allow physical activity. Habitat and behaviors  Native to the lowland and highland forests of southern China and southeastern Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma), Chinese water dragons are most commonly found along the banks of freshwater lakes and streams. They are active during the day (diurnal), and spend most of their time in the trees or plants (arboreal). If threatened, the dragon will drop from the trees into the water and either swim to safety or remain submerged for up to 90 minutes. Water dragons live in areas with average humidity levels of 40‚Äì80% and temperatures ranging from 80‚Äì90 ¬∞F (26‚Äì32 ¬∞C). Diet Though they will also eat vegetation, the diet of the water dragon consists mainly of insects, supplemented with an occasional small fish, mammal or reptile. Invasive species Chinese water dragons have established themselves in Hong Kong, probably from released pet animals.

History =Early years= Dempsey was born on 29 November 1958 in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now known as Harare, Zimbabwe); the son of Nancy and William. He moved to Salfords in Surrey, England in 1961, and attended Salfords County School from 1963 to 1970. He then went to Notre Dame Middle School between 1970 and 1972, where he met Robert Smith, Marc Ceccagno and Lol Tolhurst. Here they first played music together as The Obelisk in April 1972, giving an end-of-year performance for their classmates. Although he is ordinarily known as a bass guitar player, Dempsey played guitar for The Obelisk's only known live performance, whereas one Alan Hill played bass. He later attended Saint Wilfrid's Catholic Comprehensive School (1972‚Äì1976), and Crawley College from 1976 to 1978. In January 1976 Dempsey became a co-founding member of Malice, along with Smith, Ceccagno, and others. The band also later featured Laurence Tolhurst, and Porl Thompson. They played only a few live shows in December of that same year. = Easy Cure and The Cure - 1977‚Äì1979 = In 1977 Dempsey, Tolhurst, Smith and Thompson formed Easy Cure, who became known as The Cure following Thompson's departure in April 1978. Dempsey appeared as bassist on The Cure's singles \\"Killing an Arab\\" (1978) and \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" (1979) and on the 1979 album Three Imaginary Boys. Other than frontman Smith, Dempsey had the distinction of being the only other member of The Cure (besides Simon Gallup on the unreleased demo, \\"Violin Song\\") to sing lead vocals. He sang the cover version of the Jimi Hendrix song \\"Foxy Lady\\", which appears on Three Imaginary Boys. He made his final live performance as a member of The Cure on 15 October 1979 at London's Hammersmith Odeon on the last night of The Cure's tour in support of Siouxsie and the Banshees. In November of that year, however, the singles \\"Jumping Someone Else's Train\\" by The Cure and \\"I'm a Cult Hero\\" / \\"I Dig You\\" by Cure side-project Cult Hero were also released with Dempsey performing, respectively, bass and keyboards. The Cure's Three Imaginary Boys album and singles from 1978‚Äì1979 featuring Dempsey were later repackaged for the US market as the Boys Don't Cry album in 1980, and he appears on the band's early Peel Sessions between 1978 and 1979. In 1980 Dempsey left the group on the brink of its success.Tom Doyle, The Glamour Chase: The Maverick Life of Billy MacKenzie. Polygon Books, 2011, p. 81.  Post-Cure  In 1986 Dempsey appeared on the music video for a new version of \\"Boys Don't Cry\\". In 2004 the deluxe edition of Three Imaginary Boys was issued featuring a second disc of rare and previously unreleased material recorded between 1977 and 1979, which again feature Dempsey on bass. He also appears on some tracks on the deluxe edition of Seventeen Seconds. = Associates 1979‚Äì1983 = Upon leaving The Cure, Dempsey became the bassist for Scotland's Associates, who (like The Cure) were signed to Fiction Records. He had already performed with Associates prior to leaving The Cure, but made his debut as their new full-time bassist on 16 November 1979 at Eric's Club in Liverpool; the first night of the Future Pastimes Tour; a \\"Fiction Records Package\\" tour featuring The Cure, The Passions and Associates. He remained Associates' bassist from 1979 to 1983, appearing on the albums Fourth Drawer Down (1981) and Sulk (1982) along with a number of singles between 1980 and 1983. He also performed with the group on a series of radio sessions recorded for Radio 1's John Peel and David Jensen shows, which were later released in 2003 as the album Radio 1 Sessions Volume 1; 1981‚Äì83.  Post-Associates  The original group disbanded in 1983 following the departure of co-founder Alan Rankine, however frontman Billy Mackenzie continued to work under the name of Associates with various collaborators, including Dempsey at times. Dempsey has also continued to collaborate with Rankine. His replacement on bass during Associates' second phase was Roberto Soave, who has since appeared in several bands also featuring members of The Cure including Shelleyan Orphan, Presence and Babacar, as well as taking Gallup's place in The Cure for some live performances.

Though it received modest success, the song was one of Marvin's best ballads and served as part of the template for quiet storm and urban contemporary ballads that came afterwards. Overview Written by Marvin Gaye and his co-producer Leon Ware, the song narrates a moment where the author noticed a woman on Soul Train and convinces the girl to \\"get together\\" after the two shared a dance. Throughout the entire I Want You album, which was dedicated to Marvin's live-in lover Janis Hunter (who wrote a 2015 memoir entitled After the Dance: My Life with Marvin Gaye),Lary Wallace, \\"Marvin‚Äôs Muse\\", Los Angeles Review of Books, September 18, 2015. the narrator ‚Äî Gaye ‚Äî brings up the dance concept in songs such as \\"Since I Had You\\".

The instrumental version received a nomination at the 1977 Grammy Awards for Best R&B; Instrumental Song. The single came out on the strength of its success as a double-A side on the Billboard Club Songs chart, where it had peaked at number 10 alongside the album's hit title track. The song was Marvin's lowest-peaked pop single for the first time in 13 years since the B-side of his \\"Can I Get a Witness\\" titled \\"I'm Crazy 'Bout My Baby\\", peaking at number 74, ironically three places higher than \\"I'm Crazy 'Bout My Baby\\", while it was a bigger success on the R&B; chart, peaking at number 14.

Its goals are to support \\"the study and enjoyment of history at all levels by creating an environment that promotes lifelong learning and provides for the evolving needs of people who share an interest in history.\\" The association's patron is Queen Elizabeth II. The Historical Association was incorporated by Royal Charter in 2006, its centenary year. Legally it is a charity registered in England. The plan for a national historical association came from a group school teachers. The formation was handled by university academics, especially Professors Charles Firth, Albert Pollard, and Thomas Tout. At first it dealt chiefly with teaching problems. The membership was expanded to include laymen, and the association branched out into activities such as publication and research in local history. Herbert Butterfield, \\"The History of the Historical Association\\" History Today (Jan 1956) 6#1 pp 63-67. Activities The Historical Association is active in supporting the study and teaching of history at all levels. Membership is around 6,000, largely UK-based, with a strong following in UK secondary school history departments. The association has 58 branches through the UK which run a variety of events ranging from historical talks to walks and visits. Branch associate members take the overall membership to about 8,000. The association campaigns on their behalf and to ensure history continues to be taught well at all phases of education. The association is committed to a policy of embracing a broad church and encouraging a general interest in history and in our cultural heritage. It has published a journal for professional historians titled History since 1912.Wiley.com: History Its Annual Bulletin of Historical Literature provides reviews of the years historical books and journal articles. It also publishes Primary History, materials for teachers of teachers involved in primary education, and a journal called Teaching History for secondary school history teachers, as well as The Historian for a wider readership. The association aims to provide the best possible resources and support for history teachers in the United Kingdom, as well as providing online continuing professional development courses. History On 5 January 1906, a group of history teachers and academics met in London to discuss the proposal from Miss M. A. Howard that they establish \\"an association to co-ordinate the efforts of all those working in England towards the improvement of history teaching in our schools.\\" The aims Miss Howard identified for such an association were to be: * A place for history teachers to get advice on syllabus, textbooks and method * A means of keeping teachers in school in touch with the work of the universities * A body to bring pressure to bear on educational authorities and examining bodies * A body to persuade publishers to bring out cheap editions of good books and illustrations for use in schools The meeting agreed to act upon Miss Howard‚Äôs proposal, and in closing the meeting Professor Pollard gave a wider remit for the new association: that history should be properly recognised by universities and that history should be properly taught in our schools. This became the spark that formally founded the Historical Association on May 19, 1906. The first published aims were: * The collection of information as to existing systems of historical teaching at home and abroad, by getting together printed books, pamphlets and other materials, and by correspondence * The distribution of information amongst the members of the association as to methods of teaching and aids to teaching (viz. maps, illustrations, text books, etc.) * The encouragement of local centres for the discussion of questions relative to the study and teaching of history * The representation on the needs and interests of the study of history and of the opinion of its teachers to governing bodies, government departments, and other authorities having control over education * Co-operation for common objects with the English Association, the Geographical Association, the Modern Language Association and the Classical Association. The association‚Äôs aims have remained substantially unchanged and the aims stated in the Historical Association‚Äôs Charter closely echo these sentiments. By 1917 the constitution was changed to incorporate non-professional interest in the subject. Admission was \\"open to all persons interested in the study and teaching of history\\". The association quickly grew in the post-war years and by the early 1950s had over 70 active branches and more than 8,000 members. In 2010, the association expressed concerns over the reduction in history education in schools.

Chinese Indonesian cuisine () is characterized by the mixture of Chinese with local Indonesian style. Chinese Indonesians, mostly descendant from Hokkien, brought their legacy of Chinese cuisine, and modified some of the dishes with the addition of Indonesian ingredients, such as kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), palm sugar, peanut sauce, chili, santan (coconut milk) and local spices to form a hybrid Chinese-Indonesian cuisine. Some of the dishes and cakes share the same style as in Malaysia and Singapore which are known as the Nonya cuisine by the Peranakan.  Chinese cuisine legacy  Chinese influences are evident in Indonesian food, with several quintessential Chinese favourite has made their way into mainstream Indonesian culinary scene. Popular Chinese Indonesian foods including bakmi, mi ayam, pangsit, bakso, lumpia, kwetiau goreng and mie goreng. Chinese culinary culture is particularly evident in Indonesian cuisine through the Hokkien, Hakka, and Cantonese loanwords used for various dishes. Words beginning with ' () signify the presence of meat, e.g. ' (\\"meat bun\\"); words ending with ' () signify vegetables, e.g. ' (\\"Chinese white cabbage\\") and ' (\\"mixed vegetables\\"). Also ' or ' () signify noodle as in ' (\\"fried noodle\\"). Most of these loanwords for food dishes and their ingredients are Hokkien in origin and are used throughout the Indonesian language and vernacular speech of large cities. Because they have become an integral part of the local language, many Indonesians and ethnic Chinese do not recognize their Hokkien origins. Some of popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, mi goreng, bihun, kwetiau, lumpia and bakpia can trace their origin to Chinese influence. Some food and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous and ethnic Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the staple food of most of the country. Chinese influence is so evident in cities with large Chinese settlements since colonial era, especially in Jakarta, Cirebon, Semarang, Surabaya, Medan, Batam, Bangka, Palembang, Singkawang and Pontianak. As the result numbers of mi (noodle) and tahu (tofu) recipes were developed in these cities. Chinese influence is so evident in Betawi people (native Jakartans) cuisines that basically was formed as peranakan culture, as the result Betawi people held Chinese Indonesians dishes such as asinan and rujak juhi as theirs. To a certain extent, Javanese in Semarang, Solo, and Surabaya also willingly absorbs Chinese culinary influences, as the result they also considered Chinese-influenced dishes such as mi goreng, lumpia, bakso, and tahu gunting as theirs. Because food is so prevalent in Chinese culture as Chinese families often allocate their quality time to go eating out‚Äîjust like banquet customs commonly found in Chinese communities worldwide‚Äîmany Pecinan (Chinatowns) in Indonesian cities are well known as the culinary hot spots of the city, with rows of shops and restaurants. As Chinese and also native Indonesians establishing their food business, many eating establishments sprung up, from humble street side cart hawker to fancy restaurants offering their specialty. Areas such as Glodok, Pecenongan, and Kelapa Gading in Jakarta, Kesawan, Pusat Pasar, Jalan Semarang, Asia Mega Mas, Cemara Asri and Sunggal in Medan, Gardu Jati in Bandung, Kya-kya Kembang Jepun in Surabaya, and Pecinans in Cirebon, Semarang and Solo teem with many warungs, shops and restaurants, not only offering Chinese Indonesian dishes, but also local and international cuisines.  Adaptation to local cuisine  The Indonesian Chinese cuisine also vary with locations. For example, in different parts of Java the dishes are adapted to local culture and taste, in return Chinese Indonesians residing in this region also had developed a taste for local cuisine. In central Java, the food tends to be much sweeter, while in West Java it is saltier. In East Java, Chinese food there is more salty and savory with a preference of petis shrimp paste. In Medan, North Sumatra and also in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, a more traditional Chinese style can be found. Chinese cuisine in Indonesia also have absorbed local preference of spicy food and local ingredients. For example, it is common to have sambal chili sauce, acar pickles and sprinkle of bawang goreng crispy fried shallot as condiment. Chinese cuisine influences on Indonesian cuisine is evident in Indonesian take on Chinese dishes, such as mie goreng, lumpia, bakso and siomay. However the culinary influences is also taken another way around. Vice versa, Chinese Indonesian also been influenced by native Indonesian cuisine. It is believed that Lontong Cap Go Meh is a Chinese Indonesian take on traditional Indonesian dishes. The dish reflect the assimilation among Chinese immigrants with local community. Because Indonesia is Muslim majority country, some of ingredients were replaced to create a halal Chinese food; by replacing pork with chicken or beef, and replacing lard with palm oil or chicken fat. Most of Chinese eating establishments with significant Muslim native Indonesian clientele would do so. However, in Chinatowns in major Indonesian cities where there is significant Chinese and non-Muslim population, Chinese restaurants that serve pork dishes such as babi kecap (pork belly in soy sauce), char siew, crispy roast pork, sweet pork sausage and sate babi (pork satay) are available. There are different styles of Chinese food in Indonesia: * Traditional Chinese food, such as the Teochew, Hokkian, Hakka dishes. * Chinese-Indonesian food with recipes borrowed from local Indonesian cuisine, Dutch and other European cuisine. * Chinese dishes adapted to the local culture and taste, such as replacing pork with chicken or beef to make it halal. * New style Chinese food with chefs from China, Hong Kong or Taiwan.

The term mouseover is probably more appropriate considering current technology. Rollovers can be done by imagery, text or buttons. The user only requires two images/buttons (with the possible addition of \\"alt\\" text to these images) to perform this interactive action. Rollover imagery can be done either by a program with a built-in tool or script coding. The user will have to pick a first image and select an alternate secondary image. A mouse action will have to be set to either \\"click on\\" or \\"mouse over\\" in order for the rollover to be triggered. Note that when the \\"mouse over\\" moves on the image, the alt image/secondary image will appear but won't stay - when the user \\"mouses out\\" by moving the mouse away from the image, the original source image will reappear.  Coding  There are several different ways to create a rollover. This is an example of a rollover in CSS, JavaScript and HTML: CSS a { background-image: url(default.png); color: white; display: block; height: 30px; width: 100px; } a:hover { background-image: url(rollover.png); color: lightpink; } JavaScript var link = document.querySelector(\\"a\\"); link.addEventListener(\\"mouseover\\",function() { this.style.backgroundImage = \\"url(rollover.png)\\"; this.style.color = \\"lightpink\\"; }); function setStyleDefaults() { link.style.backgroundImage = \\"url(default.png)\\"; link.style.color = \\"white\\"; } setStyleDefaults(); link.addEventListener(\\"mouseout\\",setStyleDefaults); HTML [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/)  Different types of rollovers  While rollovers are not in themselves animated images, some users and HTML experts have managed to create animation-like effects. *Zooming rollovers: when the mouse is moved over an image/text or button, it increases its size, depending on the limit size the user sets. *Fading rollovers: when the user moves the mouse over an image/text or button, it either fades in or out, depending on the user control. *Disjointed rollovers: when the mouse is moved over an image or button, other areas on the screen change to reflect what will happen if the user clicks.

The slenthem is part of the gend√©r family. It consists of a set of bronze keys comprising a single octave: there are six keys when playing the slendro scale and seven when playing the pelog. These keys are suspended by leather cords over individual bamboo tube resonators in a wooden frame, which are cut so that the placement of the bamboo's node causes the functional length of the resonator to be shorter for higher notes. The instrument is played by striking the keys with a mallet, called a tabuh, which has a short handle and a thin wooden disk edged in cloth or rubber. One hand is left free to dampen notes. It is a low-pitched instrument with a softer sound than the saron demung. Like the saron barung and demung, it generally plays the most basic form of the melody (balungan) in a composition. However it also sometimes uses techniques similar to the saron to elaborate. It is especially favored in quieter gamelan ensembles (such as Gamelan Gadhon); but it is a part of standard Gamelan Gedh√© as the only soft- style instrument also played in loud-style pieces. It is typically placed among the instruments at the front of the performing area.

It tells the story of a young woman unlucky in love finding true love in a very shy young man. The original music score was composed by Cliff Eidelman, and includes a classical arrangement of \\"Nature Boy\\". A remixed version of Suzanne Vega's 1987 song \\"Tom's Diner\\" is featured in the opening scene of the film. Plot Caroline is a young woman living in Minneapolis. She is a beauty school student and a part-time waitress at a diner. She works with her best friend, Cindy, and Adam, a busboy and dishwasher who keeps to himself. One night at work, after Caroline's latest boyfriend breaks up with her, she and Cindy find themselves talking about Adam. Cindy confides that she thinks Adam is \\"kinda cute\\" and adds, \\"I'd do him if he wasn't so dumb\\". Walking home from work one night, Caroline is accosted by two men who attempt to rape her, but Adam shows up and fights them off. Unbeknownst to Caroline, Adam had been following her from a distance every night to make sure she gets home safely. The next evening at work, Caroline thanks Adam for coming to her rescue, and he quietly begins to open up about himself to her, bringing the two closer. Caroline later confides in Cindy that she was almost raped and that Adam saved her life, and thus she is now interested in Adam, which Cindy supports. Things begin looking up for Caroline as she and Adam become a couple: Caroline buys a used car, and Adam is beginning to overcome his shyness. One night the same two men who tried to rape Caroline attack and stab Adam outside the diner. Adam is rushed to the hospital, and Caroline later identifies the perpetrators in a police lineup. While Adam is recovering, Caroline learns that he has a heart defect and will die without a transplant. Adam, claiming that he has a baboon's heart (lovingly told to him by a nun at the orphanage where he grew up), refuses to listen, stating that he is afraid he will no longer be the same person if he gets a transplant. Caroline tries to assure Adam that love comes from a person's mind and soul, but she is deeply touched when Adam asks why it hurts so much \\"here\\" (pointing to his own heart) when one's heart is broken. On his birthday, Caroline visits Adam at his small apartment and surprises him by taking him to a Minnesota North Stars hockey game, but Adam surprises her with flowers and a gift that he left for her to be opened only after they return. At the game, Adam catches a stray hockey puck, and on the way home Adam falls asleep next to Caroline, but when they reach her house she discovers to her horror that his heart has given out and he had died in his sleep. After Adam's funeral, Caroline goes to his apartment and opens his gift for her: a box of his record albums with a handwritten note declaring his love. Cast * Marisa Tomei as Caroline * Christian Slater as Adam * Rosie Perez as Cindy * Kyle Secor as Howard * Willie Garson as Patsy Production Tony Bill discovered Tom Sierchio's screenplay for Untamed Heart during one of his talent searches: he had asked an agent at William Morris to send him screenplays from new writers. Originally, Sierchio's screenplay had been submitted as a writer's sample. Bill showed the screenplay to producer Helen Bartlett who suggested that they option it. Within two weeks of Sierchio handing his script to his agent, MGM had greenlighted the project. The film was originally titled The Baboon Heart in honor of an infant named Baby Fae (born 14 October 1984) who received a cross-species heart transplant from a baboon to fix a congenital heart defect. Initially, Bill had not considered Christian Slater for the role of Adam, \\"but then it was just the obvious choice.\\" For the role of Caroline, Bill remembered auditioning Marisa Tomei for his earlier film, Five Corners. While she had been too young for that role, after her success with My Cousin Vinny he felt she was right for the film. Sierchio's screenplay was originally set in New Jersey, but for logistical reasons they could not shoot there. The filmmakers considered finding a location to double for the state, but while Bill, Bartlett, and Sierchio were scouting in Minneapolis, they realized that it was the perfect place because of its strong acting community (they cast 35 of the film's 40 roles from it) and a large commercial production community that allowed them to utilize a mostly local crew. The city's locations were also a strong factor in deciding to shoot there. The centerpiece was Jim's Coffee Shop & Bakery, which actually existed at the time of production but was closed to the public for the duration of shooting the film. Bill said, \\"It had a wonderful combination of ingredients from every diner you've ever been to; we've done very little to change it for the film. In fact, we changed the original name of the diner in the script to reflect that it is Jim's.\\" Principal photography began in March 1992 amidst cold temperatures. However, several scenes in winter were shot in May when fake snow maintained the illusion. One scene was shot at the Met Center, the home of the then-Minnesota North Stars (now the Dallas Stars) at the time. Tomei wanted to have a believable regional accent, so chose as her driver local Craig Kittelson to double act as her dialogue coach. Home media release Untamed Heart was originally released on VHS on May 22, 1993. It was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on June 9, 2003, letterbox and pan & scan. It was released on Blu-ray by Kino Lorber on March 5, 2019. Reception Untamed Heart received a 54% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that the film was \\"kind of sweet and kind of goofy, and works because its heart is in the right place\\". Hal Hinson of The Washington Post said that the film \\"is hopelessly syrupy, preposterous and more than a little bit lame, but, still, somehow it got to me\\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times, said that the film \\"is to the mind what freshly discarded chewing gum is to the sole of a shoe: an irritant that slows movement without any real danger of stopping it\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B‚àí\\" rating and Owen Gleiberman praised Tomei's performance: \\"With her flashing dark eyes and libidinous overbite, Tomei is adorable ‚Äî she looks like a flirtatious bunny rabbit ‚Äî but what's astonishing is the range of expression that passes over those delectable features\\". Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers wrote, \\"The Rain Man-Dying Young elements in Tom Sierchio's script are pitfalls that Slater dodges with a wonderfully appealing performance. His love scenes with the dazzling Tomei have an uncommon delicacy\\". In his review for The New Yorker, Anthony Lane praised Tomei for bringing \\"startling high spirits to a dullish role. She snatches moments of happiness out of the air and shares them out to anyone who's around\\". Mike Clark, in his review for USA Today, wrote, \\"Director Tony Bill (My Bodyguard) is adept both in the yarn's meticulous buildup and in his handling of the actors\\". The film grossed $19 million in the United States and Canada and $5 million overseas for a worldwide total of $24 million.

This happens since in FX trading the trader doesn't want to actually buy the traded currencies but to continue to trade until position is closed. For example, on Monday all position with value date of Wednesday (in case of T+2) will be rolled over and the value date will be updated for Thursday. Position with value date of Friday will be updated with value date of next Monday. Trading platforms offer rollovers but the process involves a rollover interest fee which is calculated according to the difference between the interest rates of the traded currencies. If the interest rate on the trader's long position is higher than the rate on the short position, the trader receives the interest. If the interest rate on the trader's short position is higher than the rate on the long position, then the trader pays the interest. For weekends and holidays, the rollover is multiplied by the number of days of rollover.  Calculation  The calculation is based on the difference between base and quote currencies. Thus, it is needed to subtract the interest rate of the base currency from the quote currency‚Äôs interest rate. Then, it is needed to divide the result by 365 times the base exchange rate. However, usually, the rollover is shown in the trading platform or on the broker‚Äôs website, which frees the trader from unnecessary calculations. Rollover is also known as a swap fee. Thus, to check the rollover, it is needed to find a swap (long and short) on the broker‚Äôs website or in the trading platform.

The channel is targeted to youth audiences with music video as its primary content. It was introduced on free-to air television through the now- defunct television network Studio 23 in 2000. Some of the programs of Myx was shown on Studio 23 during early morning, afternoon and late evening blocks. In 2002, Myx was launched as a stand-alone 24-hour music channel on cable. On February 28, 2007, an American counterpart was created to cater the Asian- American community in United States. Myx is notable for showing the lyrics as the music video plays which was adapted from video karaoke, a popular pastime in Asia.Myx replaces MTV in the Philippines Since 2006, Myx has given the annual Myx Music Awards to the most influential personalities in the Philippine music industry. History Myx was first aired on November 20, 2000 on ABS-CBN's sister television network, Studio 23 (now S+A). It was intended to be the replacement of MTV Philippines. It aired on Studio 23 during daytime, as a block-timer. On February 14, 2002, ABS-CBN merged Myx on Channel 23 with then top-rating music cable channel, VID-OK. After the merger, Myx retained its name. However, it carried the format of VID-OK (which plays music videos with lyrics). At first, viewers of both predecessors were cold regarding the said change. However, Myx was able to gain significant audience compared to the channel's main competitors. Since then, Myx became the number one music channel in the Philippines. On January 16, 2014, Myx stopped airing on Studio 23. This was after the closure of Studio 23 to give way to the new free-to-air sports channel, ABS-CBN Sports and Action (S+A). In November 2015, the network celebrated its 15th anniversary. The month-long celebration started with \\"Myx Mo! 2015\\" at the SM Mall of Asia Concert Grounds on October 31, 2015. The following day, November 1, 2015, Myx re-branded with new shows and a new look with a major graphics overhaul. Myx also invited past and present VJs for the grand \\"Myx Homecoming\\" which was aired as a 4-part special. Finally, the network concluded the celebration with the airing of the Myx 15 documentary on November 20, 2015, the launching day of Myx wayback in 2000. Since July 30, 2018 until its May 5, 2020 shutdown (due to the Cease and Desist Order issued to NTC), Myx became available on ABS-CBN TV Plus at Channel 12 (DTT). It was launched as a free trial channel together with O Shopping, Asianovela Channel, Movie Central and Jeepney TV. Prior to this, there was Myx2, a tested complimentary channel and later on discontinued before TV Plus was officially launched in 2015. On July 11, 2019, Myx launched a secondary YouTube channel called All Music Myx which features uploads of Myxclusive performances of artists from the Myx archives. VJs and hosts Myx has produced some of the most popular VJs in the country which includes Lourd de Veyra, Luis Manzano, Geoff Eigenmann, Heart Evangelista, Nikki Gil, Bernard Palanca, and Iya Villania. Since 2007, Myx has produced the annual Myx VJ Search with the aim of searching the country's best VJs. The finalists will be given the chance to be a VJ on Myx. The current VJs of Myx are Ai dela Cruz and Samm Alvero. They will be the only VJs for now as other VJs lose their jobs due to the retrenchment of employees in ABS-CBN.

The harness typically consists of a series of leather straps, usually between 1 and 2 cm wide, attached together in such a way as to allow a person to \\"wear\\" the item. Customization of the harness may be needed depending on the specific individual's body. The item is very closely associated with BDSM play, and is often immediately identifiable as being related to kink. For this reason, it is sometimes worn publicly as a way to reference fetish culture and gain attention. Often the image of a person in a bondage harness is used in media as a trope for \\"someone into fetish play\\", such as in the Sin City comic book series. Variations The harness typically consists of a main central strap that runs in front and at the back, but with two separating straps where it passes around the head. This central strap runs between the legs, between the buttocks and up to an area midway up the back where it meets the other end of the strap. The straps are then secured together ‚Äì typically with a standard buckle such as that used on a belt to hold pants up. When fitted to a male, the harness splits in half in a similar way to the way it splits to go around the head so as to pass around the male genitals. On a female, the harness usually runs straight between the legs. There are then several other straps running out at right angles from the main central strap (usually, but not limited to, 3‚Äì4 straps). These straps wrap around the body with the two ends secured to each other using further buckles. On a female, the straps may be above and below the breasts, creating a form of breast bondage, with further straps around the waist. On a male, the straps usually criss-cross over the chest and abdomen to emphasize male physique. The item can be worn as it is on the body simply as a form of dress, but can also be used for restraint. The arms can easily be held behind the back by running the horizontal straps over the arms rather than under them against the body. When secured tightly, the arms are then pinned against the body by these straps. Further, the harness can be used as an anchor for additional restraints.

Primrose and Billy West Program for Thacher, Primrose & West's Minstrels, late 1800s. Primrose and West was an American blackface song-and- dance team made up of partners George Primrose and William H. \\"Billy\\" West. They later went into the business of minstrel troupe ownership with a refined, high-class approach that signaled the final stage in the development of minstrelsy as a distinct form of entertainment.Toll 155. History In 1877, Primrose and West were playing with a minstrel troupe owned by J. H. Haverly. That year, they both quit when their demands for more pay were not met. They formed their own company, which largely copied Haverly's United Mastodon Minstrels with its elaborate sets and visual spectacle. The troupe proved so successful that in 1879, The Clipper gave them a front-page story, treatment normally reserved for famous actors and actresses. In 1881, the pair became familiar with Sam Hague's British Minstrels, then on a U.S. tour. Primrose and West adopted Hague's techniques of ultra-refinement: Ballet and high-class music played by a large orchestra replaced low comedy and African American- themed song and dance as the main focus, and sets and costumes came to mimic fancy European powdered wigs and eveningwear. Only the (sometimes) blackfaced endmen kept the new troupe from severing its ties to minstrelsy completely. George Thatcher, one of the troupe members who became a partner of Thatcher, Primrose & West (and later had his own troupe), explained later that \\"We were looking for novelty, and for a change tried white minstrelsy.\\" When Milt Barlow left the troupe in 1882, Primrose and West did away with plantation and blackface material completely. In its place, audiences witnessed such upper- class pursuits as fox hunting, lawn tennis, and yacht racing. Primrose and West had a hit, and they came to be called \\"The Millionaires of Minstrelsy\\".1882\\\\. Newspaper clipping from \\"How Burnt Cork Pays\\". Quoted in Toll 154. Still, traditional blackface entertainers disliked the new approach. Lew Dockstader remarked that Primrose and West > had refined all the fun out of it. Minstrelsy in silk stockings, set in > square cuts and bag wigs is about as palatable as an amusement as a salad of > pine shavings and sawdust with a little salmon, lobster, or chicken. ... > What is really good is killed by the surroundings.July 1893. Clipping from > \\"Dockstaders Ideas\\". Quoted in Toll 154-5. Nevertheless, Primrose and West's approach caught on, and the blackface act continued only with minor troupes and as a regular fixture of vaudeville. George Primrose was mentioned in song as \\"Georgie Primrose\\" during the 1954 movie White Christmas. Notes References *Toll, Robert C. (1974).

There were no serious injuries. The aircraft in the incident became popularly referred to as the Gimli Glider. Three people were killed on August 27, 1992 when a NewCal Aviation turbine-modified de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou they were aboard crashed on the airfield during climb-out after a short take-off from the airport. The aircraft nosed sharply up, arced right and nosed into the ground. Although there was no explosion, a fire started and consumed the aircraft's remains. The cause was listed as failure to deactivate the plane's gust-lock control in the cockpit, which was interlocked into the throttles when the plane was powered by radial piston engines. This feature was defeated in the plane's conversion to turboprop.Four Unrelated Accidents page 6. Despite having a statutory duty to \\"investigate civil aviation occurrences that take place in or over Canada and any place under Canadian air traffic control\\" the Transportation Safety Board of Canada has no record of this incident.

It is a two player game where the object is to be the first to win four contests for Shen Gong Wu. The Shen Gong Wu are hidden mystical objects, and searching for them and using them is a central focus of the series, with conflicts over their possession resolved by a Xiaolin Showdown. The first expansion set, Wudai Warriors, was released in March 2006. Gameplay There are four types of cards (Warrior, Shen Gong Wu, Master, and Villain) and four elements (Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water) which are associated with the four Xiaolin monks and the color of the non-Villain cards. During the game, each player has a deck, a hand, a Warrior Training Area, a Vault, and a discard pile which cards will move between according to rules. There is also a Showdown Arena that is used by both players when they wish to start a Xiaolin Showdown. In addition to winning by being the first to win four Shen Gong Wu in a Showdown, it is possible to lose by running out of cards in one's deck and then being required to draw =Card types= The type of card dictates how it can be played. Each card has a skill number in a circle and a power number in a hexagon. The lower the skill number, the easier it is to bring the card into play. The higher the power number, the more powerful the card will be when used in a Xiaolin Showdown for a Shen Gong Wu. Warrior Each turn, a player may play one Warrior card to his Training Area. Such cards are played face up and upside down, so that Warrior icon on the card is right side up. The skill and power numbers of a Warrior card in the Training Area do not matter. However, the number of cards in the Training Area determines one's skill level, which is also important. During a showdown, a Warrior card may be used as a Boost card, and any special ability the card has applies only then. These cards are named after various martial arts moves that are used in the series as well as a number of additional moves with similar names, but which have not been used so far. This includes cards for the signature moves for the Xiaolin monks as both Xiaolin apprentices and Wudai warriors in the second and third season of the series. The Xiaolin apprentice move cards are \\"Rare\\" cards and the Wudai Warrior move cards are \\"Premium\\" cards. Shen Gong Wu Each turn, a player may play one Shen Gong Wu card. Such cards may either be played directly to one's Vault or be made the subject of a Xiaolin Showdown. A Shen Gong Wu card may be played directly to one's Vault only if you have a number of Warriors equal to or more than the skill number of the Shen Gong Wu. This does not count as victory in a Xiaolin Showdown, but does enable the player to tap the card in future Showdowns. If a player has no Shen Gong Wu in his hand, or does not wish to play one that is hand, he may choose to flip over the top card in his deck. If the card is a Shen Gong Wu, then there will be a Showdown for it. If it is not a Shen Gong Wu, it goes to the discard pile. During a showdown, a Shen Gong Wu card in a player's hand may be used as a Boost card. Shen Gong Wu that are in a player's vault may also be used, and any special ability that the Shen Gong Wu has applies only when the card is tapped. Not all of the Shen Gong Wu that have been featured on the show have cards in the game and some of the Shen Gong Wu in the game had not been featured on the show as of the game's launch. The game debuted during the show's third season and the promotional material for the game indicated that they would be used in future episodes, thus making purchasing the game a way for fans of the series to learn about the Shen Gong Wu before they were used on the show. Some of the Shen Gong Wu cards in the game are labeled with a second descriptor such as Animal, Armor, Clothing, Weapon, Jewel, or Trinket. Such descriptors have no effect on gameplay under the current version of the rules, but may have some effect either on tournament rules or with a future expansion set. Master Master cards are treated as if they were Warrior cards, except for three differences: # The special ability that the card has applies when the card is in the training area, but not when used as a Boost card. # Because of this reversal of when the special ability is used, the warrior icon and the power and skill numbers are placed upside down from where they are found on a Warrior card and the card is played right side up in the Training Area instead of upside down. # You must have a number of Warrior cards of the same color already in your Training Area to play a Master card in your training area. Villain Villain cards are used in place of Boost cards during a Xiaolin Showdown, and at no other time during the game. Villain cards are distinctive in that they have Gray color and they have four separate power numbers. The power number that is used depends upon the color of the Shen Gong Wu that is the object of the Showdown. Villain cards are only effective when played by the defending player, and if more than one Villain Card is played, they do not work together. =Elements= There are four elements, each of which is associated with a monk, and with the color scheme of the card. * Earth, Yellow, Clay * Fire, Red, Kimiko * Water, Dark Blue, Omi * Wind, Light Blue, Raimundo =Xiaolin Showdown= A Xiaolin Showdown begins when an attacking player chooses to put a Shen Gong Wu in the Showdown Arena. Each player may tap, similar to the system used in Magic: The Gathering, Shen Gong Wu that are in his Vault up to the point where the sum of the skill numbers of the tapped cards equals the number of Warriors in his Training Area. At least one of the Warriors in his training area must be the same color as the Shen Gong Wu in order for the Shen Gong Wu to be tapped. Any special ability that the Shen Gong Wu has can only be applied when the card is tapped. Only Shen Gong Wu cards can be tapped in this game. After both players have decided whether to tap any Shen Gong Wu, each player may choose to play one card face down from his hand or from his deck. If the card played has a skill number that exceeds the number of Warriors in the player's Training Area, it has no effect. If the card is anything other than a Villain card, it is a Boost card. A Boost card adds its Power to the Power of the Shen Gong Wu that have been tapped to give the Power number of the player, but only if the player has a Warrior card in his Training Area that is the same color. If a Boost card has a special ability that applies during a Showdown it is also applied. A Villain card played by the player who started the showdown has no effect. A Villain card played by the defending player has a Power number for that color Shen Gong Wu, and the attacking player must defeat both the defender and the Villain to win the Showdown. If a player uses a special ability that works upon winning a showdown, he must also beat any Villains in play for the ability to work. Sometimes a special ability will allow a player to Press a card. If a player Presses a card, he may play a card from the deck as a second card that will act as a Boost or Villain card. Ties in Showdowns are won first by Villains and then by the defending player. If the attacking player wins, the Shen Gong Wu goes into his Vault as an untapped card, and he has achieved one of the four victories needed to win the game. If he does not win, the Shen Gong Wu goes into his discard pile. Any Boost or Villain cards used during the Showdown go into that player's discard pile. Any Shen Gong Wu that were tapped remain tapped until either the start of that player's next turn or untapped by a special ability. Credits The game was designed by Mike Elliott. The images on the cards are taken from the animated series the game is based upon. Products Each starter set contains two 41-card decks with cards that are of the same element and include one premium card in each deck. The starter set also includes a playmat and a showdown victory encounter intended to be used to help learn the game, as well as a rulebook and a list of available cards. Booster packs contain 10 game cards and an eleventh card that contains one of four checklists on the front and one of a variety of ads for the game's website on the back. Cards are at one of four rarity levels, Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Premium. Premium cards are stated to be approximately one out of every 30.

This followed the 1988 decision R. v. Morgentaler, which had struck down the federal abortion law as a breach of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In 1993, the provincial regulations were ruled to be a criminal law, which would violate the Constitution Act, 1867. That Act assigns criminal law exclusively to the federal Parliament of Canada. Background Having won his case in R v Morgentaler, abortion rights activist Henry Morgentaler planned to open an abortion clinic in Nova Scotia. The provincial government responded by passing legislation that would outlaw such clinics (as a provincial offence) and limit abortions to recognized hospitals. This regulation was not limited to abortion but also covered liposuction and other procedures; indeed, the provincial government claimed it was merely fighting the privatization of the health care system (since Morgentaler's clinics were private). The penalty set out in the legislation would be a fine of between $10,000 to $50,000. Undaunted, Morgentaler went ahead and opened his clinic, supposedly to receive potential patients for his other clinics outside Nova Scotia. Eventually, however, Morgentaler informed the press that he had indeed carried out abortions in his Nova Scotia clinic. The government charged him for this, but Morgentaler challenged the constitutionality of the law. Ruling Upon receiving the issue, the Supreme Court declined to decide the case on the basis of the Charter and limited itself to the federalism issue. Even here, the Court limited itself by not considering the issue of whether abortion relates to peace, order and good government, which would definitely make it federal jurisdiction. Justice John Sopinka, writing for a unanimous Court, simply agreed with the argument that these specific abortion regulations, rather than being a valid provincial regulation of hospitals and medicine, instead constituted an invalid criminal law. As a result, all of these regulations were struck down, including the ones not dealing with abortion. The Court began by noting that the legislation was always meant to target specific services, and above all else abortion. In considering the law's pith and substance, this raised the question of whether the provincial government's true motives for enacting the legislation was not to regulate hospitals or medicine, but to limit what it saw as \\"the socially undesirable conduct of abortion\\" (which would be a criminal law function). The Court also noted that in Morgentaler v. The Queen (1975), it had been found that the abortion law later struck down in 1988 had been criminal law, and as such it had been appropriately passed by Parliament as opposed to by a provincial legislature. This also raised the question of whether abortion laws are designed to deal with \\"socially undesirable conduct.\\" The Court then quoted Nova Scotia's Hansard, which reinforced the notion that the provincial government saw Morgentaler's clinics as a \\"public evil which should be eliminated\\" and minimized the argument that the law had been meant to combat privatization. The Court observed that the fines were serious penal considerations, a typical feature of criminal law. The provincial regulations were also ruled to be very similar to the federal abortion law struck down in 1988 (although Nova Scotia did not resurrect the Therapeutic Abortion Committees of the federal law). The similarities were problematic to the provincial law, since similarities between provincial laws and laws in the Criminal Code have, in the past, led to provincial laws being struck down as ultra vires the provincial governments. Commentary In his book Constitutional Law of Canada, constitutional scholar Peter Hogg referred to this Morgentaler decision as \\"remarkable,\\" noting that the regulation of the procedures besides abortion had been struck down after the Court had referred to them as a \\"smokescreen\\" for the \\"true purpose of the legislation.\\" In Hogg's view, the Court had done this under the doctrine of colourability, which holds that a law designed to look like it was enacted within the powers of the relevant legislative body, but in fact attempting to regulate a matter within another level of government's authority, should be struck down. The Court, however, had emphasized pith and substance, and claimed that it did not employ the colourability doctrine in this particular case.Hogg, Peter W.

In 2001, Benpres Holdings Inc. and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company signed a master consolidation agreement for SkyCable Corporation to consolidate its interest. In July 2001, Unilink Communications Corp. operator of Home Cable, Philippines second largest cable TV company, merged its CATV operation to SkyCable and created Beyond Cable Inc. with an enterprise value of P14.5 billion. Beyond Cable Inc. controls 66.5% through Benpress Holdings Corp. and 33.5% through MediaQuest Holdings, Inc.Home, SkyCable merge - The Philippine Star ¬ª News ¬ª BusinessGMA Network opposes SkyCable-Home Cable full consolidation On December 7, 2001, Beyond Cable Holdings Inc. was incorporated. In May 2011, Singaporean firm Sampaquita Communications Pte. Ltd. acquired 40 percent of SkyCable through Philippine Depositary Receipts worth P3.612 billion and P250 million of convertible notes to fund the expansion of SkyCable's broadband Internet and cable TV services.Business - Singaporean firm gets 40% of SkyCable - INQUIRER. net On May 11, 2012, SkyCable bought Destiny Cable Inc., Uni-Cable TV Inc. and Solid Broadband Corporation's cable TV and broadband internet assets and subscribers with consolidating value of P3.497 billion.  Basic cable packages  Skycable allows its subscribers to select their own packages or channels, comparable to a pay per channel service most generally used in the United States. SkyCable also introduces the package-pricing model typically used by other cable television providers in which channels are classified into packages. = Postpaid = The SkyCable postpaid bundles are categorized into 10 clusters named as Select, Bronze 299, Bronze 399, Bronze 499, Silver HD, Gold HD, Postpaid HD (299, 549, 999, 1999) and a separate payment scheme for its Premium/Pay-Per-View. = Prepaid = SkyCable also offered prepaid packages to its cable TV service, the Silver Prepaid and Select Plus Prepaid. It was a prepaid cable TV service based on a non-recurring subscription scheme and allows non-postpaid customers to subscribe to selected channels and pay only for the desire duration of viewing and the service requires a digital addressable set-top box. The prepaid plans came in an array of card denomination to choose from that is suitable to its non-postpaid subscribers. Silver Prepaid and Select Plus Prepaid packages came in similar denomination: 3, 15 and 30 days. But as of around 2011 or 2012, it currently no longer offered for new subscribers and status of remaining subscribers remained uncertain. But recently, as of around 2015, the Prepaid service were relaunched and introduced Prepaid 99 and Prepaid 250, and each prepaid package/s valid within 30 days. It was offered initially available for Greater Manila Area and provinces nearby (Cavite and Laguna). It was later expanded its service for regional system areas, first it was expanded for new subscribers in Cebu and Davao, then the rest of Visayan cities (Bacolod, Iloilo and Dumaguete) and lastly expanded in General Santos.Me & My SKY  PLANS & BUNDLES  CABLE Date Retrieved: October 28, 2015 In 4th Quarter In 2016 The Prepaid Plan Has Been Phase Out But However it still available for Loading Amounts. = Digital system = In an ongoing exertion to battle cable piracy and averting illegitimate connections, SkyCable through SkyCable Digital adopts digital video broadcasting for cable or DVB-C. It is a standard for transmitting digital television signal over cable. SkyCable uses digital video compression or distribution through its digital addressable box or the Digibox, a digital set-top box that uses the DVB-C broadcast standard to give its subscribers access to its digital infrastructure. = Smart card = SkyCable Digital's Digibox conveys programming with encryption to alleviate signal piracy. It utilizes ISO/IEC 7816 smart cards, which transmit digital signals to the receiver to decrypt the programming for viewing. To fully consummate the Digibox, it uses Irdeto Access B.V. smart cards, which are ISO/IEC 7816 compliant. It is given to all subscribers with standard and high definition set-top boxes. The smart card stores the subscriber's information and the plan to which they subscribe. = High-definition channels = On September 19, 2008, SkyCable initiated the pay-per-view broadcast of the 2008 Ryder Cup golf tournament in high-definition (HD). It is transmitted in 1080i resolution and paves the way for the Philippines to convey the first HD signal. In July 2009, Skycable also commenced a locally produced HD program through, Balls HD, the collegiate basketball tournament‚ÄîUniversity Athletic Association of the Philippines and the National Collegiate Athletic Association. At present, SkyCable offers over 20 HD channels accessible through separate payment. Lineup consists of RTM HD, ABS-CBN HD, ABS-CBN Sports + Action HD, ANC HD, CNN HD, Discovery Asia, Discovery HD, History HD, Kapamilya Channel HD, National Geographic HD, HBO HD, NBA Premium TV HD, Fox Movies HD, Fox Crime HD, FOX Life HD, Comedy Central HD, HBO Hits HD, Fox HD, MTV Live HD, Fox Family Movies HD, ASN HD, Cartoon Network HD, Nickelodeon HD, Outdoor Channel HD, Fashion TV HD, Freeview Channel HD, AXN HD, Disney Channel HD, Fox Sports HD, Fox Sports 2 HD and Fox Sports 3 HD. = Personal video recording = On December 8, 2010, SkyCable announced that it would launch a new service similar to U. S.-based TiVo for its high and standard definition services within the first quarter of 2011.Inquirer.Net Business News Initially, the service will be called PVR or personal video recording, which has a 500GB internal hard drive enough to record 135 hours of cable programs in high definition or 217 hours for its standard definition service. Distinct from regular digital video recorders, the PVR uses the built-in electronic program guide that enables its subscribers which programs to be recorded. The new service will also feature Timeshift, a new way of recording programs to be viewed to at a time more opportune to its subscribers, and that would also allow recording of favorite programs on a time delay basis. Timeshift will also allow its subscribers or has the ability to pause live broadcast and in slow motion.BusinessWorld Online, Business News http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=22592 On March 21, 2011, SkyCable launches its first personal video recording in the Philippines, the iRecord. It is an enhanced version of its digibox. It allows subscribers to record cable programs up to 145 hours in standard definition or 86 hours in high definition platform. It comes with a 320GB disk space.  Carriage and content disputes  = GMA Network signal tampering/distortion = In February 2003, GMA Network filed a complaint against SkyCable for allegedly moving its signal from channel 12 without approval of the National Telecommunications Commission. Authorities decided on April 25, 2003 that SkyCable violated the provisions of Memorandum Circular 4-08-88 and ordered to carry the free-to-air television signal on its system except when theoretically impracticable. It also ordered SkyCable to faithfully and strictly conforms with the requirements and to conclude from randomly changing channel assignments without notice and approval from local authorities. As a result, SkyCable filed a motion for reconsideration addressing the rule invalidate the means as it conflicts with a state law on intellectual property but local authorities denied the motion and directed SkyCable to comply with its previous decision. Consequently, the latter filed another appeal through an appellate court but still rejected their request and ordered them to conform to local authorities resolution. In August 2015, SkyCable Corporation answered GMA Network's complaint over the loss of television signal during the KalyeSerye segment of Eat Bulaga. Citing tweets from outraged fans of the AlDub love team featured in the said segment of the noon-time show, GMA filed a complaint before the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) through a letter dated Aug. 25. The network said subscribers \\"are being short-changed through irresponsible acts of their service provider\\" and appealed for the NTC to take immediate action about the \\"apparent sabotage\\" perceived by the viewers. In its statement, SkyCable denied the accusations assuring their customers of their commitment to provide the best service and resolve any glitches. ‚ÄúThe complaint of GMA 7 with the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) last August 25, 2015, regarding shortchanging of our SkyCable subscribers via irresponsible acts, is a malicious accusation and is without basis,\\" the Lopez-owned firm said. \\"If there were service interruptions that inconvenienced some of our subscribers, these were isolated and would have affected other channels, not only GMA 7.\\" The cable provider also expressed their willingness to cooperate with investigations that the NTC may pursue regarding the incident. = Carriage disputes with Solar Entertainment = On January 1, 2008, Solar Entertainment Corporation pulled its 6 cable channels from Sky Cable; namely Basketball TV, Solar Sports, ETC Entertainment Central, 2nd Avenue, Jack TV and Crime/Suspense. The channels were replaced by 6 new channels owned by fellow subsidiary Creative Programs, Inc.; AXN Beyond, Balls, Fox Crime, KidsCo, Maxxx and Velvet. While vice president Juno Chuidian stated in a report to GMA News TV that the new channels were added because they would offer less \\"redundant\\" programming and feature more series that had never been aired in the country before, reports surfaced that the channels were pulled due to a dispute; ABS-CBN believed that Solar's lower fees for advertising on its channels were causing ABS-CBN to lose revenue. Solar Entertainment however, retaliated by expanding its partnership with the terrestrial broadcaster Radio Philippines Network; adding programming from its C/S cable channel to its primetime lineup, and using the channel as part of its successful bid against ABS-CBN for the next PBA broadcast contract. = AksyonTV = On March 14, 2011 TV5 filed a complaint to the National Telecommunications Commission against Sky Cable, accusing it of refusing to carry AksyonTV, despite law designating all free-to-air television networks as must-carry channels. The channel was added to Sky Cable's digital lineup on April 30, 2011.

The Doolittles, after a brief career as graphic artists, became \\"traveling artists\\" and drove in a motorhome around the American southwest, painting scenes of the landscape as they went. It was during this period that Bev's expansive paintings of the American Western landscape and its wildlife began to develop and soon after, she began to portray Native Americans‚Äîoften including them alongside animal themes. Doolittle has become a popular artist in the United States, and her original paintings and prints are collected widely by those interested in the Western themes she portrays. Realistic Western art has conventionally been dominated by oil painting, and Doolittle was instrumental in bringing watercolors into the genre, and garnering respect for this medium from collectors of Western art. Doolittle has also co-authored and illustrated several books. She has long been interested in the plight of Native Americans, wild animals, and ecological and environmental issues and her books‚Äîlike her paintings‚Äîfocus on these issues. A unique and distinctive aspect of her art is what she refers to as \\"a camouflage technique\\" in which certain details of her art can be seen in more than one way; for example, in \\"The Forest Has Eyes\\", the rocks and waterfalls seen close up appear as the faces of Native Americans when viewed from a distance. In \\"Mesa Ruins\\", close- up viewing appears to show the Mesa Verde Canyon Anasazi dwellings, although from a distance it gives an impression of the eye and nose of a Native American male. In \\"Shoshone Switchback\\", the snow-filled meadow in which horseback riders are crossing appears from farther away to be the shape of a running horse.

The circled area is the part where synapsis occurs, where the two chromatids meet before crossing over Synapsis (also called syndesis) is the pairing of two homologous chromosomes that occurs during meiosis. It allows matching-up of homologous pairs prior to their segregation, and possible chromosomal crossover between them. Synapsis takes place during prophase I of meiosis. When homologous chromosomes synapse, their ends are first attached to the nuclear envelope. These end-membrane complexes then migrate, assisted by the extranuclear cytoskeleton, until matching ends have been paired. Then the intervening regions of the chromosome are brought together, and may be connected by a protein-RNA complex called the synaptonemal complex. Autosomes undergo synapsis during meiosis, and are held together by a protein complex along the whole length of the chromosomes called the synaptonemal complex. Sex chromosomes also undergo synapsis; however, the synaptonemal protein complex that holds the homologous chromosomes together is only present at one end of each sex chromosome. This is not to be confused with mitosis. Mitosis also has prophase, but does not ordinarily do pairing of two homologous chromosomes. When the non-sister chromatids intertwine, segments of chromatids with similar sequence may break apart and be exchanged in a process known as genetic recombination or \\"crossing-over\\". This exchange produces a chiasma, a region that is shaped like an X, where the two chromosomes are physically joined. At least one chiasma per chromosome often appears to be necessary to stabilise bivalents along the metaphase plate during separation. The crossover of genetic material also provides a possible defence against 'chromosome killer' mechanisms, by removing the distinction between 'self' and 'non-self' through which such a mechanism could operate. A further consequence of recombinant synapsis is to increase genetic variability within the offspring. Repeated recombination also has the general effect of allowing genes to move independently of each other through the generations, allowing for the independent concentration of beneficial genes and the purging of the detrimental. Following synapsis, a type of recombination referred to as synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA) occurs frequently. SDSA recombination involves information exchange between paired non-sister homologous chromatids, but not physical exchange. SDSA recombination does not cause crossing-over. Both the non-crossover and crossover types of recombination function as processes for repairing DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks (see Genetic recombination). The central function of synapsis is therefore the identification of homologues by pairing, an essential step for a successful meiosis. The processes of DNA repair and chiasma formation that take place following synapsis have consequences at many levels, from cellular survival through to impacts upon evolution itself. Chromosome silencing In mammals, surveillance mechanisms remove meiotic cells in which synapsis is defective. One such surveillance mechanism is meiotic silencing that involves the transcriptional silencing of genes on asynapsed chromosomes. Any chromosome region, either in males or females, that is asynapsed is subject to meiotic silencing. ATR, BRCA1 and gammaH2AX localize to unsynapsed chromosomes at the pachytene stage of meiosis in human oocytes and this may lead to chromosome silencing. The DNA damage response protein TOPBP1 has also been identified as a crucial factor in meiotic sex chromosome silencing. DNA double-strand breaks appear to be initiation sites for meiotic silencing. Recombination In female Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies, meiotic chromosome synapsis occurs in the absence of recombination. Thus synapsis in Drosophila is independent of meiotic recombination, consistent with the view that synapsis is a precondition required for the initiation of meiotic recombination.

United States Naval Ship (USNS) is the prefix designation given to non-commissioned ships that are property of the United States Navy (USN).  Definition  United States Naval Ships are unarmed auxiliary support vessels owned by the U.S. Navy and operated in non-commissioned service by Military Sealift Command with a civilian crew. Some ships include a small military complement to carry out communication and special mission functions, or for force protection. In comparison, U.S. Navy ships commissioned into service have the designation \\"USS\\" and are armed, crewed by U.S. Navy personnel, and held in property by the United States Government. Additionally, the United States Naval Ships hull classification symbol begins with \\"T-\\" to denote its civilian crew. The USNS prefix can be assigned only while the ship is owned by the U.S. Navy. If, after being taken out of service, the ship is transferred to the Maritime Administration the prefix reverts to a civilian ship prefix such as the case of SS Comet.

A World War II veteran and well-known public speaker, Branigin took office with a Democratic general assembly, the first time since the Great Depression that Democrats controlled both the executive and legislative branches of the Indiana state government. Branigin was a conservative Democrat who oversaw repeal of the state's personal property taxes on household goods, increased access to higher education, and began construction of Indiana's deep-water port at Burns Harbor on Lake Michigan. During his one term as governor, Branigin exercised his veto power one hundred times, a record number for a single term. Branigin was the last Democrat to serve as governor of Indiana until Evan Bayh took office in 1989. In 1968 Branigin received national attention when he ran as a stand-in for Lyndon B. Johnson in Indiana's Democratic presidential primary. Johnson dropped out of the race on March 31, 1968, but Branigin continued to run as a favorite son candidate against Robert F. Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy. Branigin hoped his efforts would gain a stronger role for Indiana at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. Branigin finished second in the primary to Kennedy. After his term as governor ended, Branigin returned to Lafayette, where he resumed a private law practice and remained active in civic life, serving as president of the Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce and the Harrison Trails Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Branigin also served as a trustee for Franklin College, Purdue University, and the Indiana Historical Society. Early life Sign marking Branigin's birthplace in Franklin Branigin was born on July 26, 1902, in Franklin, Indiana.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 347. Branigin's father was a lawyer, teacher, and amateur historian. Branigin attended local public schools, graduating from high school in 1919, and went to nearby Franklin College, where he majored in Spanish, French, and history. Branigin was involved in the school's drama club as well. After graduating from Franklin in 1923, he enrolled at Harvard University Law School, where he earned a law degree in 1926. Branigin returned to Indiana and took a job with the Johnson County prosecutor's office, and remained there for three years. On November 2, 1929, Branigin married fellow Franklin College graduate Josephine Mardis. The couple had two sons, Roger Jr. and Robert.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 348. In 1930 Branigin took a job as attorney for the Federal Land Bank and the Farm Credit Administration in Louisville, Kentucky. He was soon promoted to general counsel for the bank and traveled a five-state region giving speeches. He retired from the bank in 1938 to join a law firm in Lafayette, Indiana. Branigin became a partner in the Stuart, Branigin, Ricks, and Schilling law firm. At the outbreak of World War II, Branigin joined the U.S. Army and was assigned to the contract division of the Judge Advocate General's Office in Washington, D. C., where he became head of the legal division of the army's transportation corps with the rank of lieutenant colonel.Encyclopedia of Indiana, p. 119. After the war, Branigin returned to his Lafayette law practice. Political life A longtime Democrat, Branigin was active in local and state politics. In 1948 he chaired the Democratic state convention. After Democratic gubernatorial candidate Henry F. Schricker won the election that year, he appointed Branigin as chairman of the state conservation commission. Branigin also served as president of the Indiana Bar Association. In 1956 Branigin entered the race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but he was defeated by Ralph Tucker. Indiana governor At the Democratic state convention in June 1964, Branigin won the gubernatorial nomination on the first ballot. Branigin's Republican opponent, incumbent Lieutenant Governor Richard O. Ristine, had cast a tie-breaking vote in the Indiana Senate allowing a state sales tax, which was an unpopular decision among voters. During the campaign, Branigin attacked Ristine on his tax-raising record. In addition, Branigin earned an endorsement from the traditionally Republican Indianapolis Star and several other state newspapers, helping him win the election by the largest margin in state history at the time. His campaign song was an adaptation of the blues song Walk Right In. Democrats also took control of the Indiana General Assembly for the first time since 1938. Once in office, Branigin proved to be more conservative than the leadership in the general assembly. He vetoed a record one hundred bills, including an abortion legalization bill, a ban on the death penalty, and union protection laws. Despite his disagreement with the general assembly on a host of issues, Branigin had a number of his agenda items passed into law. He successfully advocated for state-funded scholarships for higher education, increased the state's civil rights commission's powers, upgraded the state prison system, expanded the state highway system, abolished the poll tax, and created a number of new public parks and nature preserves. During Branigin's term as governor, he also oversaw the repeal of the personal property tax and began work on the Port of Indiana, the state's first deep-water harbor on Lake Michigan.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 349. Presidential candidate In early March 1968 President Lyndon Johnson asked Branigin to run as his stand-in during the Indiana Democratic presidential primary. Branigin agreed and campaigned earnestly as a Hoosier candidate representing Hoosiers. When Johnson announced he would drop out of the race on March 31, Branigin decided to continue his campaign, hoping to control the state's votes at the Democratic convention in Chicago later that summer. Despite a hard-fought campaign and early leads in the polls, Branigin lost the Indiana primary to Robert Kennedy. Branigin earned 238,700 votes compared to Kennedy's 328,118, but he came in ahead of third-place finisher Eugene McCarthy.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 350. Later life After leaving politics Branigin once again returned to his Lafayette law practice. In later years he served as president of the Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce, the Harrison Trails Council of the Boy Scouts of America, and a board member of Franklin College and Purdue University. During his lifetime Branigin amassed a large collection of books, which he later donated to the Franklin College library.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 346. Branigin also served as a member of the Indiana Historical Society board of trustees from 1965Ruegamer, p. 335. to his death. Branigin died in Lafayette on November 19, 1975, and was buried in Greenlawn Cemetery in his hometown of Franklin, Indiana.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 351. During the 1990s, the Branigin Bridge, a state highway bridge in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, was named in his honor.Indiana General Assembly. \\"House Concurrent Resolution 0018.\\" See also *List of Governors of Indiana Notes References * WorldCat * WorldCat * WorldCat *Indiana General Assembly. \\"House Concurrent Resolution 0018.\\" Retrieved February 17, 2012.

It has five sections: Pre-Primary, Infant, Junior, Middle and Senior Schools.http://cathedral-school.com/about-cathedral/school-profile/ The school also controls the 300-year-old St. Thomas Cathedral; CAJCS was founded to provide choristers to the Church. History In 1860 Bishop Harding and the Cathedral Chaplain opened a grammar school within the walled city of Bombay which, along with a smaller establishment for girls, were the first of many strands that have joined to form the Cathedral and John Connon School.Adapted from the 125th Anniversary SouvenirAdapted from the School Diary A Choir School, established with the objective of providing choristers for the St. Thomas Cathedral, Mumbai, the first Anglican Church in Mumbai was founded in October 1875. Meanwhile, the Bombay Scottish Education Society was founded in 1866. The society put up a building on the Esplanade, and named it for John Connon (then Chief Registrar of Bombay). In 1878 a high school in Byculla, set up by the Bombay Diocesan Society, was merged with the Choir School to form the Cathedral High School. The present Senior School building, a blend of Indian and Gothic architecture, was erected in 1896. A girls' school had been started in 1880. In 1922, in a public meeting held at the Town Hall, the present Asiatic Society of Bombay library, a suggestion was put forward by the principal of the Cathedral Boys' School for the Cathedral Schools and the Scottish School to work together, instead of competing, and thus the Anglo-Scottish Education Society was conceived. The schools were re- organized into the Cathedral Boys' School, the Cathedral Girls' School, and the John Connon School. Today the old boys' school is the Senior School; the old girls' school is the Middle School; and the John Connon School is the Junior School. The Infant School, located at Malabar Hill, was set up in 1965. The Senior School also serves as the main administrative office for all the sections of the school. The IB arm of the school, set up in 2015, plans to shift to the Deutsche Bank Building (formerly Tata Palace) by 2018. The building is located in the same vicinity (Fort) as the school, right next to Sterling Theatre. =School badge= In 1923 the Cathedral Schools and the Scottish School were amalgamated to form The Anglo-Scottish Education Society. Miss Whitfield, the Principal of the Girls' School, wanted a badge which was representative of both elements of the Society: Anglican and Scottish. A badge was designed in which the Bishop's Mitre represented the Anglican side, while the Scottish neighbours were symbolised by the white diagonal cross of St. Andrew. Academics and curriculum The Cathedral & John Connon School is affiliated with the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), and its students appear for the Council's ISC, IB (Grade 12) and IGCSE, ICSE (Grade 10) examinations. English is the medium of instruction. Hindi is taught as a second language and Marathi or Sanskrit are taught as third languages. A Hindustan Times report of 2013 named it the best ICSE and ISC school in the country. It now offers the IBDP programme and IGCSE programme, as well. College Board's Advanced Placement program has been conducted in the school since June, 2004. The school is the only AP Examination Center in Western India. Cathedral Model United Nations (Symposium) The Cathedral Model United Nations is run entirely by the school's student body over a period of three days, where students assume the roles of delegates representing countries. From a start in 1996 - the first CMUN had only one committee (Asia and Pacific Council), it has grown into an event with over 700 delegates attending. CMUN 2007 was the first to have delegates from outside Mumbai. Schools like Mayo College, La Martiniere Calcutta, Doon School, Modern School Barakhamba Road, and others attended the conference. 2011 featured the first international delegates from Rato Bangala School from Nepal and Aitchinson College, Pakistan. House system There are four houses in the school - Barham, Palmer, Savage and Wilson - named after Barham (a canon), James Palmer (Bishop in Bombay), Arthur Savage and Percival Wilson, the founders of the Cathedral School and the John Connon School. The House System serves as the centre of school life, with students from the houses competing at sports, games and other co-curricular activities, primarily divided into 2 categories- Cultural and Sports which include a plethora of activities. There was also another house, that was brown in color, called Kuruvilla that was later disbanded and students were distributed amongst the houses available since it made more sense to have four houses in order to keep competitions easier.

It lies within the Marquenterre regional park, an ornithological nature reserve. Geography Situated just to the north of the estuary of the river Authie, Berck has a huge expanse of sandy beach and impressive grassy-topped dunes facing north onto the English Channel. The town comprises two parts ‚Äì to the east, the old fishing town of Berck-Ville and to the west the seaside area, Berck-sur-Mer. Toponymy Berck is attested through the centuries in various forms: datum BergisAlbert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, Dictionnaire √©tymologique des noms de lieu en France, Librairie Gu√©n√©gaud, Paris, 1979, , p. 72b and Berc in 1215,Ernest N√®gre, Toponymie g√©n√©rale de la France, Librairie Droz, Gen√®ve, p. 732, n¬∞ 12349 (read in French) Bierk in 1282.Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, 72b. Its origin has been conjectured to come either from Germanic berg \\"hill\\", \\"mount\\" or birkja \\"place of the birch trees\\", designating the birch tree wood nearby.Maurits Gysseling, Toponymisch Woordenboek van Belgi√´, Nederland, Luxemburg, Noord-Frankrijk en West-Duitsland (v√≥√≥r 1226), 1960, pp. 198‚Äì199 (read in French, Dutch and German) Ernest N√®gre, 732 The Modern Dutch word for \\"birch\\" is berk. In Dutch the name is Berk-aan-Zee. History The old town was formerly a fishing harbour which in 1301 was recorded to have 150 homesteads with 800 inhabitants. A mediaeval wooden lighthouse, known locally as a fo√Øer, was built on a dune and lit by charcoal and faggots but this burned down several times. On one occasion at least it was as a result of the continuous conflict between the English and the French in the Hundred Years War. The chronicler Enguerrand de Monstrelet mentions that during 1414 the English garrison in Calais raided south and burned the town.La chronique d'Enguerran de Monstrelet, Paris 1858 Vol.2 p.266 Eventually the lighthouse was replaced by a stone tower at the side of which a chapel was built in the 15th century, but this did not save it from further mishap. During the second siege of Montreuil in 1544, the English advanced from the south and burned 200 houses, the church and the mill as they passed through Berck. What was left of the place was then burned by the French on their way to relieve the siege.Louis Br√©sin, Chroniques de Flandre et d'Artois: Analyse et extraits pour servir a l'histoire de ces provinces de 1482 √† 1560, Dumoulin, 1880. The chapel was later extended to join the tower, making what is now the church of St-Jean-Baptiste, but the tower was only converted to a belfry after the sea retired, leaving it 1.5 kilometres inland. It is for this reason that the present division between the original village and the sea-front area exists. As a result, boats were then designed with flat bottoms so that they could be drawn up on the beach and a cart was driven out to them in order to bring in the catch (see Eug√®ne Boudin's painting below). In the mid-19th century, Berck took on a therapeutic role in the treatment of tuberculosis. The Maritime hospital was inaugurated in 1869 by Empress Eugenie.Bruno Vanobber and Nancy Vansieleghem, \\"Repairing the body, restoring the soul: the Sea Hospital of the City of Paris in Berck-sur-Mer and the French war on tuberculosis\\", Paedagogica Historica 46.3, June 2010, pp. 325‚Äì340 Other hospitals and benevolent institutes were soon created to cater for the sick and those in need of rest and recuperation. It was at this time that the medical benefits of sea bathing were being recommended and the town, advertised as just a three-hour journey from Paris, began to build up its tourist trade with the help of the railways. At first one had to alight at the nearby town of Verton on the main line to Calais, but in 1893 a branch line was built connecting it with other towns in the region. As well as carrying passengers, there was also goods traffic from the brick-works at Berck Ville. Known locally as le Tortillard for its wandering route, it was closed in 1955. There was a later narrow-gauge line running northwards through the dunes from Berck Plage to Paris-Plage, as Le Touquet was then known. It was built in stages via Merlimont between 1909-12 but gradually sanded over and closed in 1929. File:Berck poster.jpgRailway advertising File:Train √† Berck-Plage 1.jpgThe beach station (1911) File:Convoi en gare de Merlimont (ligne Berck- Le Touquet).jpgMerlimont dunes station During World War II the sea front was disrupted by the installation of the Nazi Atlantic Wall and the town suffered from bombing during the allied invasion in 1944. This contributed to the diminishing of the ancient fishing industry, which numbered some 150 boats at the turn of the century, and had all but disappeared by the 1960s. Today, although the hospital sector remains economically important, the town has again promoted itself as a tourist attraction. A seaside bathing station, with an immense beach of fine sand on the Opal Coast, it continues to be a centre for sand yachting and the new sport of surfboarding. The former Berck Plage railway station has been converted into a casino. In 1974 the town twinned with Bad Honnef in Germany and in 1981 with Hythe in England. Buildings The church of Saint Jean Baptiste was restored in 1954 and the 15th century carvings on its corbels were then highlighted in paint. The choir and belfry are now listed monuments. The new church of Notre-Dame des Sables was opened in 1886 on the marketplace of the beach quarter. Its seating for 1,500 was to cater principally for holiday makers in season and the patients from the many medical establishments profiting from the sea air. There are paintings on the choir walls. Beside its medical establishments, the beach quarter catered to the moneyed classes in the second half of the 19th century and slowly filled with grandiose villas, hotels and amenities. Among these were handsome casinos, of which the principal was the Eden, also known as the Grand Casino de la Plage, with its theatre and music hall. This was destroyed in 1944 but is survived by its equally gorgeous rival, the Kursaal.There are several photos and post cards of these, along with casinos in neighbouring towns, on the Government cultural site The ambitious Cottage des Dunes, which tried to unite a luxury hotel and casino, failed commercially in 1913. After a brief spell as a hospital, it entered into official use. Another official building that survived the bombing was the town hall, which was built in 1893 and has murals painted by Jan Lavezzari. After the stone tower of St John the Baptist fell into disuse as a lighthouse, it was replaced at first by a primitive oil lamp suspended in the dunes to mark the sandbars at the river mouth. Two years later a 10-metre tower was mounted above a keeper's cottage but this became masked when the maritime hospital was built in 1861 and a new, taller tower was constructed in 1868. The two buildings, referred to locally as father and son (le p√®re et fils), stood next to each other until they were dynamited by the Germans in 1944.Paul Billadaz, Berck √† travers les si√®cles vol. 2 The current concrete lighthouse, designed by Georges Tourry, was completed in 1951 and is 45 metres high.

These began in the final decades of the 19th century with early trials of photography from unmanned kites. Among the first working locally was the English meteorologist E.D.Archibald in 1887; he was followed the next year by Arthur Batut and during 1889-91 by Emile Wenz.John Ruler, Cross-Channel France: Nord-Pas de Calais, Bradt Travel Guides, 2011 p.120 The experiments continued until 1914 and some of the photos found commercial use on postcards. The town has had an aerodrome since 1917. This was in part because at the start of the 20th century, the area played its part in the race to take to the air. The artist Jan Lavezzari, who had originally studied engineering, tested a double lateen sail hang glider from the Merlimont sand dunes in February 1904. He was followed there that Easter by Gabriel Voisin, who made a trial flight in a glider plane modelled on that of the Wright Brothers and over a few seconds was airborne for 50 metres.Gijsbert-Paul Berk, Andr√© Lefebvre and the cars he created at Voisin and Citro√´n, Veloce Publishing Ltd, 2009 p.11 His one-time partner Louis Bl√©riot never experimented with flight at Berck, but he did develop and test the sand-yacht (l'aeroplage) there in 1911 and pioneered the first race over the sands in 1913. Since 1966 a six-hour endurance race has been hosted by the local Eole Club.Piers Letcher, Eccentric France, Bradt Travel Guides, 2003 p.30 And since 1986 there has been an annual kite-flying festival each April on the sands, attracting international exhibits of great beauty and inventiveness.There is a video of the 2009 festival here. Population The inhabitants are called Berckois. Over the past two centuries there has been a steady growth in the population of the town, which in the 1793 census was 983, only a little more than the 800 recorded in 1301. In 1851 this had doubled to 2,216 and after the commercial development during the second half of that century had climbed to 7,799 by 1901. It more than doubled again by 1936 (16,700) but fell to 11,529 by 1946 and as of 2009 stands at 15,565.:fr:Berck (Pas-de-Calais)#√âvolution d√©mographique Image:Berck - Station baln√©aire.JPGBerck ‚Äì The sea front File:Aeroplage1913-3.jpgA sand-yacht on the beach in 1913 Image:Berck_- _La_plage.JPGThe sands Image:Berck_-_Les_dunes.JPGThe dunes The 'Berck School' of painters Painters joined the 19th century Parisian visitors to the town and passed on news of their discovery to fellow artists in the capital.

After World War I the town and its inhabitants continued to be represented artistically by Roussel and by Louis Montaigu (1905‚Äì1988). Fishermen in interiors were a speciality of the latter. A collection of these and other Opal Coast painters was opened in 1979 in the Municipal Museum, sited in Berck's old Gendarmerie, which was built at the end of the 19th century by Emile Lavezzari.

The town figures unfavourably in the long poem \\"Berck-Plage\\" by Sylvia Plath.Ariel, London 1965, pp.30-35 She had visited it in 1961 and wrote the poem a year later, mixing there memories of maimed war veterans at the Berck hospital with impressions of the recent death and funeral of a neighbour.Jack Folsom, Death and Rebirth in Sylvia Plath's \\"Berck-Plage\\", Temple University 1994 In Jean-Paul Sartre's Le Sursis (The Reprieve) the character of Charles is evacuated from the military hospital at Berck just before the outbreak of the Second World War. The town also figured in the novel Une ann√©e √† Berck by Christian Morel de Sarcus (Paris, 1997).Christian Morel de Sarcus, Biographie Language The language originally spoken by the inhabitants was Picard, from which originated several expressions used by fishermen. Although it has now retreated before standard French, there are still those who seek to preserve it. Berck has a language association, T'yn souvyin tu? and there have been linguistic studies of the local dialect. These include the poet Edouard Grandel's Lexique du patois berckois (Universit√© de Picardie, Amiens, 1980), Lucien T√©tu's Glossaire du parler de Berck (Soci√©t√© de linguistique picarde, 1981) and his √Ä l'√©coute des Berckois : Dictons et proverbes, sobriquets (Soci√©t√© de linguistique picarde, 1988).

It is a credited remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo. Plot In Prohibition- era Texas, a wanderer named John Smith (Bruce Willis) drives his Ford Model A Coupe into the small bordertown of Jericho. As he arrives, a young woman named Felina (Karina Lombard) crosses the street, catching Smith's eye. Moments later, a group of Irish mobsters, led by Finn (Patrick Kilpatrick), surround Smith's car. They warn him against staring at \\"Doyle's property\\" and smash up his car. Stranded and with no money to get his car fixed, Smith goes to see Sheriff Ed Galt (Bruce Dern); the cowardly Galt refuses to help him. Instead, Smith walks to the town hotel, run by Joe Monday (William Sanderson), gets a drink and a room, and arms himself. He then goes to Doyle's headquarters and challenges Finn to a duel, which Smith wins with alarming speed. Smith departs and returns to the hotel bar, much to the surprise of Jericho's residents. Learning of Finn's death, Fredo Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), the head of Jericho's Italian gang, offers Smith a job in his outfit. Strozzi is eager to wipe out his rivals, and is hiring anyone who can fight to build up his gang. Smith agrees to his offer and meets Giorgio Carmonte (Michael Imperioli), son of a prominent Chicago mobster who is monitoring Strozzi's activities in Jericho. Carmonte expresses his immediate distrust and dislike of Smith, who leaves, and meets and seduces Strozzi's mistress, Lucy (Alexandra Powers). Smith accompanies Strozzi and his men to a backcountry road, where they meet Ramirez, a corrupt Mexican police official on Doyle's payroll. The gang ambushes and kills Doyle's men and seizes a caravan of illicit liquor. Carmonte travels to Mexico to cut more deals with Ramirez, while Doyle (David Patrick Kelly) and his chief enforcer, Hickey (Christopher Walken) return to Jericho and are informed of Finn's death and the loss of the shipment. Smith defects to Doyle's side and reveals Ramirez's betrayal. Hickey travels to Mexico, kills Ramirez and a corrupt Border Patrol officer involved in the liquor trade, and kidnaps Carmonte. Doyle contacts Strozzi and demands a large ransom for Carmonte, as well as the return of his trucks. Strozzi in turn kidnaps Felina and offers to trade her instead. The two gangs make the exchange and return to their respective empires. Smith is summoned by Sheriff Galt and meets Captain Tom Pickett (Ken Jenkins) of the Texas Rangers, who has been sent to investigate the Patrol officer's death. He warns Smith that he can tolerate one gang in Jericho, but not two, and intends to bring a company of Rangers in ten days to wipe out both sides. Smith says he intends to play the gangs against each other, destroying them both and making money in the process. Pickett agrees to his plan, but warns Smith that if he finds him there after ten days, he'll kill him as well. Lucy comes to Smith and reveals that Strozzi had her ear cut off for sleeping with him. Smith gives her some money and puts her on a bus out of Jericho. The next day, Smith relays a false rumor that Strozzi is bringing in more soldiers. Playing on Doyle's obsession with Felina, he convinces Doyle that Strozzi will try to kidnap her again to learn where Felina is being kept. Smith kills the men guarding Felina and gives her one of Doyle's cars and some money. The next day, Smith is waiting at the safehouse when Doyle arrives, and claims that he arrived too late to keep Strozzi from kidnapping Felina. Doyle's henchman Jack McCool (R. D. Call) believes Smith's story, but Hickey does not. Doyle goes berserk and declares all-out war on Strozzi and his gang. Smith's plan goes awry when Hickey ambushes him, having received word that Felina was spotted heading towards Mexico. Doyle imprisons Smith and has him tortured, demanding to know where Felina is. Despite the heavy torture inflicted on him, Smith refuses to talk. Later that night, he overpowers his guards and escapes with Monday and Sheriff Galt. As they are driving out of town, they see Hickey and his men slaughtering Strozzi's gang at a roadhouse. Strozzi and Carmonte try to surrender, but are gunned down without mercy. Smith takes refuge at a remote church where Felina went to pray. Two days later, Sheriff Galt arrives and informs Smith that Monday was caught smuggling food and water to the church and that Doyle will probably torture him to death. He then hands Smith his pistols, saying that's all the help he's willing to offer. Smith returns to town, kills McCool and the rest of Doyle's men, and rescues Monday. Doyle and Hickey are absent, having gone down to Mexico in a desperate search for Felina. Smith lures Doyle to his location, and lets Monday take revenge by shooting the gangster with his revolver. Hickey pretends to surrender and tries to kill Smith, who outdraws and shoots him dead. Smith gets into his Ford (which was repaired by the town mechanic for free) and drives on to Mexico, his original destination, leaving Monday some money and Doyle's car to return to Jericho. He reflects that he is as broke as he was when he first arrived, but consoles himself by saying that everyone in Jericho is better off now.

Hill says, \\"It took me a long time to be persuaded to do it. I thought the very idea of adapting Mr. Kurosawa was insanity for the obvious reasons. The first movie was very, very good and in addition I would be in the long shadow of Mr. Kurosawa who is probably our most revered filmmaker.\\" When he learned that Kurosawa was supportive of an American remake, Hill agreed to write and direct‚Äîbut on the condition that the film not be a Western (there was already an unauthorised European remake, the Spaghetti Western 'A Fistful of Dollars', which had been the subject of litigation). He decided to do it as a 1930s gangster film using techniques of 1940s film noir. \\"This is the story of a bad man, who as soon as he arrives begins pushing buttons and doing things only for himself\\", said Hill. \\"But we also discover that this man is at a point of spiritual crisis with himself and his own past. And this man decides that maybe he should do one good deed, even if it goes against all the rules of his life as he understands it ... The action and the violence must be organic to the story being told. I think this is obviously by its nature a very dark and very hard movie, so I think it would be dishonest to tell the story and present the physicality in a softer way. Besides, I don't think this is the most brutal film imaginable. There's actually very little blood other than in the sequence where Bruce gets beaten up.\\" He admitted the film was not realistic. \\"I don't think anything akin to the social realism movies of the 1930s is being attempted\\", he said. \\"We're into a 'once upon a time' mythic-poetic situation.\\" Hill signed to make the project in 1994. The film was green lit by New Line Cinema's head of production Michael De Luca who allocated a $40 million budget. The film was known by several titles including \\"Gundown\\", then \\"Gangster\\", then \\"Welcome to Jericho.\\" Hill later said that he and Bruce Willis \\"were not close when we did the film\\" but \\"I liked working with him. It was impersonal. Classic, 'I know what you mean. You want me to be a Bogart, Mitchum kind of guy' and I said 'Exactly. Let it happen.' He then took that and gave what I thought was a very good performance. I always sensed there was a kind of core resentment that Bruce felt he should be more appreciated for his talents. At the same time I think there is a limitation, that he does certain things better than others, and he hasn't always chosen so wisely.\\" Hill's original cut of the movie was over two hours long. Before Hill edited the final theatrical version his rough cut was used to edit the trailers for the movie, which is why there is lot of alternate/deleted footage shown in them, including many alternate takes, different edits of some scenes, extended versions of scenes, some extra lines of dialogue, shots and parts of deleted scenes including additional shootout sequence between two gangs and alternate ending in which Hickey is killed by Smith in a different way. Some promotional stills and pictures also show several deleted scenes. Reception The film was a box office bomb, grossing only a total $18,127,448 domestically by December 22, 1996, and brought in only $47,267,001 worldwide. The film received mixed to negative critical reviews. It has a 37% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"Last Man Standing's brooding atmosphere and bursts of artfully arranged action prove intriguing yet ultimately insufficient substitutes for a consistently compelling story.\\" Common recurring complaints address the oppressive and depressing atmosphere of the film; the flat, almost monotonous personality of Willis' character between gunfights; and the film's Pyrrhic victory finale. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Critic Roger Ebert (who gave the film one star) wrote: > Last Man Standing is such a desperately cheerless film, so dry and laconic > and wrung out, that you wonder if the filmmakers ever thought that in any > way it could be ... fun. It contains elements that are often found in > entertainments ‚Äî things like guns, gangs and spectacular displays of death ‚Äî > but here they crouch on the screen and growl at the audience. Even the > movie's hero is bad company. ... The victory at the end is downbeat, and > there is an indifference to it. This is such a sad, lonely movie.

Raphael is most widely known for his work with The Strokes, whom he met while attending an early show at Luna Lounge on Ludlow Street, New York City. He produced their debut EP The Modern Age as well as their first two albums Is This It and Room on Fire. The EP and first album were recorded entirely in his basement studio Transporterraum NYC (co-owned by Jimmy Goodman). He has also produced many songs with Sarah Maguire, Fake Chemical State for ex-Skunk Anansie lead singer Skin, Mexico's top rock band Fobia, the well loved album \\"Soviet Kitsch\\" by Regina Spektor.

Career  = Early career = As a musician, Raphael formed two bands in Seattle, Mental Mannequin and Colour Twigs. He was also the keyboardist for the Seattle-based psychedelic band Sky Cries Mary and part of a dark-wave band called Absinthee with Anna Mercedes. His favorite instrument is the Arp Odyssey, which he started learning at age 18. This small 1970's analog synthesizer creates an infinite pallet of evocative, intense outer space noises as well as a barrage of bass which he uses on many of his own and other artist's recordings. = 2000s: The Strokes and work in Europe = Raphael moved to London in 2002 following the success of Is This It, and founded a studio there called The Silver Transporterraum of London. In his first year living there, he worked with thirty bands, and was asked to produce the debut album of The Libertines whilst mixing live sound on their first-ever UK Tour (with The Vines and The Strokes). Rapahel also began curating a club night called The Basement Club with Transgressive Records co-founder Toby L, presented very early concerts by Regina Spektor, Bloc Party, The Libertines, and Gordon's own band Black Light among many others. In 2005, after working for almost a year on The Strokes album First Impressions of Earth, Gordon was replaced as producer by David Kahne. He moved to Berlin to be close to his friend, producer Moses Schneider. From his Berlin base, many European bands began to contact him via the internet to work, including Zeno and the Stoics (Madrid), Mikkel Glasser (Copenhagen), Satellites (Mallorca), Big Deal (London), A Brand (Brussels), Deportivo (Paris), Scanners (London), Olivia Anna Livki (Berlin), Super 700 (Berlin), Ian Astbury (London), Eva Loft (Berlin), and The Michelles (Berlin). = 2010s: Further international work and original music = In January 2010, Raphael went to Cape Town, South Africa, to produce the debut album Shark by indie rock band The Plastics.

He then met Ricky Berger and co-engineered her new collection of songs. Around the time of Hurricane Sandy, he was back for a rare visit to Manhattan producing an album for Lewis Lazar, then luckily being called to his beloved Seattle for an album with Ben Ireland (a drummer that Gordon worked closely with in many of his own musical bands including Mental Mannequin, The Tears of Gloom, and Sky Cries Mary). Whilst in the Pacific Northwest Gordon was introduced to The Tempers, a \\"wild-electronic band of brother and sisters\\" and recorded three demos with them. In May 2013, he went to Lima, Per√∫, to record a Peruvian new band called Los Outsaiders. In October 2013, he went to Seattle, Washington, and recorded a 7-song EP with Red Martian. In April 2014, Gordon went to Mexico City and recorded a 6-song EP with the up-and-coming band Sol Flamingo while simultaneously filming a small documentary on \\"the making\\" of it with Montreal based filmmaker Patrick Barbeau. Gordon Raphael performed at British & Irish Modern Music Institute in Berlin (BIMM) in March 2016. In March 2018 Gordon released his \\"first proper solo album\\" SLEEP ON THE RADIO via Zero Hours Records in London. This record was mostly recorded in Buenos Aires. Then a very fortunate development occurred when rising Argentinian musician Rocco Posca asked Gordon to produce his new album Fervor for Sony Music. In June 2018 these recording sessions began, and on the first day Maria Florencia Silva, one of the musicians on SLEEP ON THE RADIO offered to start a new band with Gordon, called The Wild Cards which toured throughout South America in 2018. On January 1, 2019, Gordon released his album I Lick The Moog, which had been recorded in his old NYC Studio Transporterraum during Christmas 2000, four months before the recording of The Strokes Is This It began.

These DVTs typically occur in the axillary and/or subclavian veins. Signs and symptoms The condition is relatively rare. It usually presents in young and otherwise healthy patients, and also occurs more often in males than females. The syndrome also became known as \\"effort-induced thrombosis\\" in the 1960s, as it has been reported to occur after vigorous activity, though it can also occur due to anatomic abnormality such as clavicle impingement or spontaneously. It may develop as a sequela of thoracic outlet syndrome. It is differentiated from secondary causes of upper extremity thrombosis caused by intravascular catheters. Paget‚ÄìSchroetter syndrome was described once for a viola player who suddenly increased practice time 10-fold, creating enough repetitive pressure against the brachiocephalic and external jugular veins to cause thrombosis. Symptoms may include sudden onset of pain, warmth, redness, blueness and swelling in the arm. Diagnosis is usually confirmed with an ultrasound. These DVTs have the potential to cause a pulmonary embolism. Diagnosis Duplex ultrasonography MR Venography Prevention Prevention of Paget-Schroetter disease can be accomplished by gradual increases in activity and by avoiding strenuous upper extremity activity. Madden CC, Putukian M, Young CC, McCarty EC. Netter's Sports Medicine. Saunders. Philadelphia, 2010. Treatment The traditional treatment for thrombosis is the same as for a lower extremity DVT, and involves systemic anticoagulation to prevent a pulmonary embolus. Some have also recommended thrombolysis with catheter directed alteplase or mechanical thrombectomy with angioplasty to maintain patency prior to surgical intervention. If there is thoracic outlet syndrome or other anatomical cause then surgery can be considered to correct the underlying defect.  History  The condition is named after two men. James Paget first proposed the idea of venous thrombosis causing upper extremity pain and swelling, and Leopold von Schr√∂tter later linked the clinical syndrome to thrombosis of the axillary and subclavian veins.L. von Schr√∂tter.

In most designs, a small extra winding on each of the RF amplifiers' tuned anode coils was used to generate a small antiphase signal, which could be adjusted by special variable trim capacitors to cancel out the stray signal coupled to the grid via plate-to-grid capacitance. The Neutrodyne circuit was popular in radio receivers until the 1930s, when it was superseded by the superheterodyne receiver. History The circuit was developed about 1922 by Harold Wheeler who worked in Louis Hazeltine's laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology, so Hazeltine is usually given the credit. The tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver, one of the most popular radio receiver designs of the time, consisted of several tuned radio frequency (RF) amplifier stages, followed by a detector and several audio amplifier stages. A major defect of the TRF receiver was that, due to the high interelectrode capacitance of early triode vacuum tubes, feedback within the RF amplifier stages gave them a tendency to oscillate, creating unwanted radio frequency alternating currents. These parasitic oscillations mixed with the carrier wave in the detector, creating heterodynes (beat notes) in the audio frequency range, which were heard as annoying whistles and howls from the speaker. Hazeltine's innovation was to add a circuit to each radio frequency amplifier stage which fed back a small amount of energy from the plate (output) circuit to the grid (input) circuit with opposite phase to cancel (\\"neutralize\\") the feedback which was causing the oscillation. This effectively prevented the high-pitched squeals that had plagued early radio sets. A group of more than 20 companies known as the Independent Radio Manufacturers Association licensed the circuit from Hazeltine and manufactured \\"Neutrodyne\\" receivers throughout the 1920s. At the time, RCA held a virtual monopoly over commercial radio receiver production due to its ownership of the rights to the Armstrong regenerative and superheterodyne circuits. The Neutrodyne ended this control, allowing competition. Compared to the technically superior superheterodyne the Neutrodyne was cheaper to build. As basically a TRF receiver, it was also considered easier for non-technical owners to use than the early superhets. After manufacture each tuned amplifier stage had to be neutralized, adjusted to cancel feedback; after this the set would not produce the parasitic oscillations which caused the objectionable noises. By 1927 some ten million of these receivers had been sold to consumers in North America. By the 1930s, advances in vacuum tube manufacturing had yielded the tetrode, which had reduced control grid to plate (Miller) capacitance. These advances made it possible to build TRF receivers that did not need neutralization, but also made Edwin Armstrong's superheterodyne design practical for domestic receivers. So the TRF circuit, including the Neutrodyne, became obsolete in radio receivers and was superseded by the superheterodyne design. The Neutrodyne neutralization technique continues to be used in other applications to suppress parasitic oscillation, such as in RF power amplifiers in radio transmitters.

They are one of the major divisions of the Beja people. The Bishari speak the Beja language, which belongs to the Afroasiatic family. Demographics The Bishari live in the eastern part of the Nubian Desert in Sudan and southern Egypt. They reside in the Atabai (also spelled Atbai) area between the Nile River and the Red Sea, north of the Amarar and south of the Ababda- basically between the Nubian desert and the Nile valley, an area of limestone, mountains, with sandstone plateaus. The Bishari population numbers around 42,000 individuals. Most of the tribe moves within the territory of Sudan, where members have political representation in the Beja Congress. Language The Bishari speak the Beja language as a mother tongue. It belongs to the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic family. The Beja inhabiting Sudan also speak Sudanese Arabic as a second language. In 1949, a member of the Bishari tribe stated that when they meet a stranger, they immediately ask \\"'Are you biggaweijet (=Bi≈°ari) or belaeijt (Arab)?'\\" and continued \\"‚Äò...We call our language biggawija and it contains many elements of Arabic (belaeijet).'\\" Economy The Bishari are traditionally nomadic people, working in husbandry of camels, sheep, and goats in the Southern part of the Eastern Desert.

NAPHA was founded in 1978 by a former employee of Chicago‚Äôs Riverview amusement park (closed 1967) and has grown through the years to include amusement park enthusiasts from around the world. About Since its founding in 1978, the National Amusement Park Historical Association (NAPHA) has worked closely with the amusement industry to further its mission of preserving its heritage and traditions. As the world‚Äôs only organization dedicated to all aspects of the amusement industry, the organization fills a unique role. As part of NAPHA‚Äôs mission to preserve the heritage and traditions of amusement parks, the organization tries to work with the industry to protect key components of its history. NAPHA‚Äôs efforts have resulted in the preservation of several historic rides including: * The second Tilt-A-Whirl ever manufactured * The only Teeter Dip in existence * One of America's last remaining Venetian Swings rides, now at Crossroads Village, Flint, MI * A 1936 Smith & Smith Chairplane, which found a new home at Bay Beach Park in Green Bay, WI. But ride preservation goes beyond the restoration of actual rides. NAPHA has also played an active role in recreating lost classics, providing vintage blueprints that led to the construction of the Raging Wolf Bobs at Geauga Lake, a modern version of the Bobs at Chicago‚Äôs defunct Riverview Park, and most recently, the re-creation of a classic wooden Flying Turns by Knoebels Amusement Resort in Pennsylvania. In addition, NAPHA was the catalyst for the reconstruction of the Zippin' Pippin wooden coaster at Bay Beach. Materials for these recreations came from NAPHA‚Äôs archives. Located in a climate controlled storage facility outside Chicago, NAPHA‚Äôs holdings are highlighted by the John Caruthers Collection, quite possibly the largest collection of amusement park postcards with over 16,000 items, and Eugene K. Feerer Collection. Feerer was a former president of International Amusement Device. Inc. (IADI) the successor to National Amusement Devices (NAD). In addition to a wealth of information on IADI, NAD and Dayton Fun House, the collection contains what is perhaps the largest collection of John A. Miller materials anywhere including blueprints, photographs and correspondence. But NAPHA cannot preserve the industry alone and in 1993 it began its Life Membership Award to honor organizations from around the world that demonstrate a \\"commitment to preserving the heritage and traditions of the amusement park industry.\\" Since that time the award has been presented to Pleasure Beach, Blackpool, UK; Kennywood, West Mifflin, PA; Playland, Rye, NY and Knoebel‚Äôs Amusement Resort. Each park was singled out for their extensive lineup of well-maintained historic amusement rides. Preservation efforts To further support its mission of preserving the heritage and tradition of the amusement industry, NAPHA established the Heritage Fund in 1994. Using funds raised from member and industry donations, memorabilia auctions and other fundraising events, the fund had succeeded in donating nearly $40,000 to organizations working to protect industry history. Recipients have included industry related museums, groups working to preserve or restore specific historic rides and non-profit operators of amusement parks. Annual members survey In 1986, NAPHA became first organization to survey its members on a regular basis. Initially intended to provide feedback to NAPHA‚Äôs Executive Committee, it soon became an anxiously awaited listing of favorite parks and attractions by an experienced group of amusement park visitors. Many parks, including Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA, and Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, PA, use the results in their promotional campaigns. In Spring 2012, the results of the 26th annual members‚Äô survey were announced. For the 22nd consecutive year, Busch Gardens, Williamsburg, VA, has been selected as the Most Beautiful Park. Other 2012 favorites include: * Favorite Traditional Amusement Park ‚Äì Kennywood, West Mifflin, PA * Favorite Theme Park ‚Äì Walt Disney World, Lake Buena Vista, FL * Best Park for Families ‚Äì Knoebels Amusement Resort, Elysburg, PA * Favorite Wood Roller Coaster ‚Äì Phoenix, Knoebels Amusement Resort, Elysburg, PA * Favorite Steel Roller Coaster ‚Äì Millennium Force, Cedar Point, Sandusky, OH * Best New Attraction ‚Äì Zippin Pippin, Bay Beach Amusement Park, Green Bay, WI Events Each summer NAPHA hosts two or three special events, inviting its members from around the world to experience an amusement park in a unique way. NAPHA visits parks of all shapes and sizes from the largest theme parks to smaller family owned facilities, but whenever possible, focuses its events on amusement parks celebrating major anniversaries. Since its founding, NAPHA has honored 18 amusement parks that have celebrated their 100th anniversary, including 17 of the 41 in the United States that have hit that milestone. The organization has also been on hand for four 125th anniversaries, a 90th, three 75ths, a 50th and a 25th. The 2019 event will be a 'Milestone Celebration' at Morey's Pier, Playland's Castaway Cove, and Gilligan's Wonderland along the Jersey Shore. 2020 will highlight the 100th anniversary of the Wonder Wheel, located at Deno's Wonder Wheel Park, Coney Island, NY. Past conventions have included tours of amusement parks in Europe, Great Britain and California; Anniversary Celebrations at Cedar Point (Ohio), Kennywood (Pennsylvania), Knoebels Amusement Resort (Pennsylvania), Seabreeze (New York), Waldameer Park (Pennsylvania) and Idlewild and Soak Zone (Pennsylvania); and weekends visiting amusement parks on the Jersey Shore and in the New England, Denver, and Minneapolis areas. Other recent host parks have included Busch Gardens (Virginia), Indiana Beach (Indiana), Kings Island (Cincinnati), Dollywood (Tennessee) and Holiday World (Indiana). Conventions typically include an opening party/reception, a picnic lunch, behind the scenes tours, a memorabilia auction and numerous exclusive ride times on the park‚Äôs roller coasters and other unique and historic rides.

Let further F_n:X\\\\to\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{R}} be a sequence of functionals on X. The \\\\Gamma\\\\text{-lower limit} and the \\\\Gamma\\\\text{-upper limit} are defined as follows: :\\\\Gamma\\\\text{-}\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} F_n(x)=\\\\sup_{N_x\\\\in\\\\mathcal{N}(x)}\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\inf_{y\\\\in N_x}F_n(y), :\\\\Gamma\\\\text{-}\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} F_n(x)=\\\\sup_{N_x\\\\in\\\\mathcal{N}(x)}\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\inf_{y\\\\in N_x}F_n(y).

Then F_n are said to \\\\Gamma-converge to the \\\\Gamma-limit F:X\\\\to\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{R}} if the following two conditions hold: * Lower bound inequality: For every sequence x_n\\\\in X such that x_n\\\\to x as n\\\\to+\\\\infty, : F(x)\\\\le\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} F_n(x_n). * Upper bound inequality: For every x\\\\in X, there is a sequence x_n converging to x such that : F(x)\\\\ge\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} F_n(x_n) The first condition means that F provides an asymptotic common lower bound for the F_n. The second condition means that this lower bound is optimal. Relation to Kuratowski convergence \\\\Gamma-convergence is connected to the notion of Kuratowski-convergence of sets. Let \\\\text{epi} (F) denote the epigraph of a function F and let F_n:X\\\\to\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{R}} be a sequence of functionals on X. Then : \\\\text{epi} ( \\\\Gamma\\\\text{-}\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} F_n ) = \\\\text{K}\\\\text{-}\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\text{epi}(F_n), : \\\\text{epi} ( \\\\Gamma\\\\text{-}\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} F_n ) = \\\\text{K}\\\\text{-}\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\text{epi}(F_n), where \\\\text{K-}\\\\liminf denotes the Kuratowski limes inferior and \\\\text{K-}\\\\limsup the Kuratowski limes superior in the product topology of X\\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}. In particular, (F_n)_n \\\\Gamma-converges to F in X if and only if (\\\\text{epi}(F_n))_n \\\\text{K}-converges to \\\\text{epi}(F) in X\\\\times\\\\mathbb R. This is the reason why \\\\Gamma-convergence is sometimes called epi-convergence. Properties * Minimizers converge to minimizers: If F_n \\\\Gamma-converge to F, and x_n is a minimizer for F_n, then every cluster point of the sequence x_n is a minimizer of F. * \\\\Gamma-limits are always lower semicontinuous. * \\\\Gamma-convergence is stable under continuous perturbations: If F_n \\\\Gamma-converges to F and G:X\\\\to[0,+\\\\infty) is continuous, then F_n+G will \\\\Gamma-converge to F+G. * A constant sequence of functionals F_n=F does not necessarily \\\\Gamma-converge to F, but to the relaxation of F, the largest lower semicontinuous functional below F. Applications An important use for \\\\Gamma-convergence is in homogenization theory. It can also be used to rigorously justify the passage from discrete to continuum theories for materials, for example, in elasticity theory.

Established in 1948, ISP is both the oldest and largest international school in the Czech Republic, with around 900 students representing more than 60 nationalities. ISP is accredited by the Council of International Schools (CIS) and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). The Czech Ministry of Education has also authorized the school to teach foreign nationals, in addition to Czech citizens. ISP offers its 11th and 12th grade students the opportunity to take the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. According to Czech tax law, ISP has only one shareholder, The International School of Prague Foundation, a US 501(c) organization. As a not-for-profit organization, any surpluses are re-invested in the school. The school's financial statements are externally audited and made available to the public. ISP is governed by a volunteer Board of Trustees, who also hire the director of the school. The current director, as of July 2008, is Dr. Arnie Bieber. School life ISP is divided into three sections: elementary school, middle school, and upper school, which are all located on the same campus. The school offers a large number of extra-curricular activities in the form of different clubs (such as Model United Nations, National Honor Society, jazz-band, and a variety of other student-led organizations) and sports teams. The school is a member of the Central and Eastern European Schools Association, competing against other member schools in sports such as association football (soccer), cross country running, tennis, volleyball, basketball, swimming and softball, as well as academic activities such as math competitions and Speech & Debate. The middle school and upper school also have active student councils that organize charity and entertainment events. History In 1948 ISP (at the time called the English Speaking School of Prague) was founded in the Embassy of the United States, Prague. The school remained in the embassy until 1979, when it moved to a new location known as the \\"Little Hillside Campus\\". At the time, the school had 80 students in Pre-Kindergarten through 8th grade. By 1991, with the addition of more students and grade levels, the school was located in three different locations. From 1992 to 1994, 9th-12th grades were added, with the first ISP seniors graduating in 1995. Finally, in 1996, all classes were brought together on the current, custom-built campus in the village of Nebu≈°ice, in the ≈†√°rka valley, part of the Prague 6 district. In 1998 the school celebrated its fiftieth anniversary with an enrollment of 588 students. Ten years later, in celebration of its 60th anniversary, ISP underwent a 6.5 million euro renovation of the current campus.

Upright ears as well as Roman nose The Border Leicester is a British breed of sheep. It is a polled, long-wool sheep and is considered a dual-purpose breed as it is reared both for meat and for wool. The sheep are large but docile. They have been exported to other sheep- producing regions, including Australia and the United States. Description The live weight of a mature Border Leicester ram is in the range of and a mature ewe . A yearling ewe is around . Their white wool tends to be very long and by Merino standards, broad crimped, and in fineness about 32 to 38 microns, and is used for medium- to heavy-weight garments. This wool, though, is prized by spinners because of the crimp and lustre. The sheep are normally shorn twice a year when the wool has reached a length of around . Lambs yield an average of of wool; yearlings may yield at each shearing. The United States, Australian and New Zealand Border Leicesters very rarely sport the extreme of British flocks. All strains of Border Leicesters are known for their docility. They produce good milk and are good mothers with a lambing percentage of about 150%. Border Leicesters are all white with a distinct long body, well-developed chest, well-sprung ribs and a wide, strong back. The nose should be black and the ears should be large, upright and alert. Feet should also be dark in colour. The head and legs should be free of wool and only covered in short white hair making it easier for shearing. Sheep of this breed should also have a distinct Roman nose much like the North Country Cheviot. There are key strengths associated with the Border Leicester making them an excellent breed for farmers. They have excellent maternal characteristics meaning that they make good mothers while producing quality lambs. Lambs finish quickly due to their high growth rate and produce high quality, desirable meat. The breed is also hardy and easy to keep and manage. History Border Leicester ewe 1893 The Border Leicester was developed in 1767 in Northumberland, England. Their name derives from the fact that their birthplace is near the border of Scotland with their foundation stock being Dishley Leicester rams. The Dishley Leicester was created and bred by Robert Bakewell (1726-1795) by crossing the old lincolnshire breed with the leicestershire type sheep. The Dishley Leicester became very popular with local farmers. George and Mathew Culley bought some of Robert Bakewell's Dishley Leicesters and the breed was soon found on both sides of the border through sales held by the Culley brothers. Around the 1830s two distinct types of Dishley Leicesters were developing on the two sides of the border. The Culley brothers were crossing their sheep with Teeswater sheep while other farmers in different areas along the border were crossing with Cheviots. This variation in the breed resulted in the two being nicknamed the \\"Bluecaps\\" and the \\"Redlegs\\". Many farmers preferred the hardier redlegs and around 1850 this variation of the Dishley Leicester became known as the Border Leicester. They were a fairly common breed in the UK by the 19th century. =Internationally= Australian strain U.S. strain Registered flocks are now found in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Border Leicester sheep have been exported to British Guiana, Canada, China, Colombia, South Africa, France, Spain, Portugal, United States, India, Japan, Yugoslavia, Iran, Hungary, Russia, Turkey and Switzerland. Border Leicester sheep were imported to Australia in 1871, where they now have a large number of stud flocks. Border Leicester rams are used for mating with Merino ewes to breed the first- cross mothers that are so valuable for the production of prime lambs. Border Leicester Merino cross ewes produced in this way offer the greatest overall performance when breeding meat type sheep, with a well proportioned carcase, high fertility, good foraging ability and good milk production. Border Leicester Merino cross ewes are mated to shortwool rams (e.g. Poll Dorset or Southdown) to produce prime lambs, which grow rapidly to market weights and have the ideal carcase shape. The vast majority of Australian lambs produced for meat are bred in this manner.*Stephens, M (et al.), Handbook of Australian Livestock, Australian Meat & Livestock Export Corporation, 2000 (4th ed), Border Leicester sheep also contribute about 50 percent of the genetics used in the Gromark breed of sheep that were developed in Australia.Sheep breed compendium, Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX), 2010 The breed was imported into New Zealand in 1859, and after refrigeration was introduced in the 1880s, the Border Leicester was used as a crossing sire to produce heavyweight lambs and wether mutton. The Border Leicester was later used to develop New Zealand's Border-Romney cross (Coopworth) and the Border-Corriedale (Borderdale) breeds. The first breed association was formed in 1888 in the United States Currently, there are two associations: American Border Leicester Association and the North American Border Leicester Association. Breeders show their sheep at county shows and fairs throughout the year with a National Show being held annually at the North American International Livestock Exposition held in Louisville, Kentucky every November.

Its foundation, the Honor Code, states, As a member of the St. Stephen's & St. Agnes School community, I pledge that I will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do. The student-run Honor Council is responsible for the administration of the Honor Code in the Upper School. Every year in the fall, at the beginning of the school year, students pledge their commitment to the Honor System by signing copies of the Honor Code.  Athletics  St. Stephen's & St. Agnes School competes in the Interstate Athletic Conference (boys) and Independent School League (girls). The girls' lacrosse team is a perennial power, currently ranked in the top five in the nation, having finished the 2008 season undefeated. In 1997 the girls' lacrosse team was ranked #1 in the nation. The 2010 girls' varsity lacrosse won the ISL league title and the VISAA State Championships. Then in 2009, the girls' lacrosse team won their third consecutive VISAA title as number one. The success of the girls' lacrosse team lies behind Kathy Jenkins, the team's coach. In 2008 Jenkins had been coaching the team for 32 years and had even started the whole program along with Alix Fellows. Jenkins, who also works as a fifth grade PE teacher and coaches the seventh and eighth grade teams, works to teach girls how to play at a very young age, and as one athlete puts it, \\"Coach Jenkins basically breeds lacrosse players\\". Many of the varsity team has been at St. Stephen's and St. Agnes since the lower school, and so are raised by Jenkins to succeed in the sport. Jenkins teaches the girls initially to master a wooden lacrosse stick instead of a metal one, which she claims is easier to throw and catch with. Jenkins asserts that in order to be a top team, intensity and dedication are integral, but wishes that the girls on her team would feel less pressure. The school's wrestling program also has a rich history, regularly turning out state and IAC champions; three wrestlers to date have won the Lehigh National Prep Tournament, two of them twice. The 2010 varsity softball team won the ISL AA Tournament Championship and also finished the season tied for first place in the league. The 2010 boys varsity lacrosse team won the VISAA State Championship. The girls' varsity tennis won the ISL Championship in 2010. The girls' varsity field hockey also won the ISL and State Championships in 2010. Many St. Stephen's & St. Agnes School's athletes go on to play at the collegiate level each year. The sports offered include: baseball, basketball, cross country, field hockey, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling.  Arts  The school theatre program, known as the Stage One Players, has won several regional awards for their performances including the Cappies. The 2009 fall production of A Midsummer Night's Dream was nominated for four Cappie Awards (Critics and Artist Program) including lighting, make-up, and supporting actor, putting each in the top five out of 54 productions. In 2015 SSSAS was nominated for five Cappies for the \\"Richard III\\" production. Two seniors won a Cappies award in the Creativity category for music composition and performance. In addition, SSSAS received two Cappies nominations for the fall production of ‚ÄúThe 39 Steps‚Äù in the Sound and Special Effects/Technology categories. The instrumental and choral programs also have particularly strong reputations. In 2010, students won seats in regional musical groups including the All-District Chorus and All-District Band, as well as participating in solo and ensemble juried events. In 2010, the Upper School String Orchestra received a rating of \\"Superior\\" as a level five orchestra at the District X Festival. Also in 2010, the Wind Ensemble received a rating of \\"Excellent\\" for the fifth straight year as a level four wind ensemble. In addition, more than 25 students have been inducted into the Tri-M, the high school music honors society. In 2003, the school completed construction of a Chapel and Performing Arts Center (CPAC). The auditorium seats 500 and has complete blackout capability to darken the space during daylight hours. The stage is full-sized and is equipped with complete theater rigging, an S model Steinway baby grand piano, and complete sound and lighting systems. There is a green room equipped with audio of live on-stage acts and male and female dressing rooms with special lighting and paging systems. The CPAC also includes music classrooms, a recording studio, and a music library. Sustainability =Students For Sustainability= St. Stephen's and St. Agnes School has a drive for sustainability. The school will host its ninth annual ‚ÄúStudents For Sustainability‚Äù conference in spring 2017. The third sustainability conference earned local recognition, where a few attendees were interviewed on by Fox 5 reporters. Students For Sustainability is a conference in which approximately 100 students from the Washington D.C. metro area come together to learn about the issues and discuss plans for achieving better sustainability in schools. =Initiatives= Over the last decade, SSSAS has worked to make its buildings efficient, optimize transportation systems, and reduce solid waste through recycling, improved purchasing, and paperless communication. To increase awareness of energy consumption and encourage responsible energy use in classrooms and offices, the school maintains a real-time energy dashboard that reports school progress of energy consumption. The school also integrates sustainability into its curriculum. Students learn about watersheds through hands-on activities at many of Alexandria's waterways and participate in cleanups along the Potomac River. Students also participate in tree planting activities to increase Alexandria's tree canopy. As part of broader outreach, SSSAS hosts the annual Students for Sustainability Conference, which brings 250 students together from around the region for a day of environmental education and camaraderie. National and local speakers and activists share their passion and expertise with the students and engage them in a day full of hands-on activities to encourage their advocacy for environmental awareness and action. The school believes that in order to prepare their students for the world as it is, they must educate them on what the issues are and the role that humans have played in its cause. The school seeks to see this through by creating a sustainability committee, a group of students, faculty, staff, and administrators from all three campuses who get together to achieve the school's goals of sustainability. St. Stephen's and St. Agnes also has sustainability initiatives within each campus. At the Lower School, there is Kinder Garden, a project in which the kindergarteners plant and maintain their own garden. Another is the Fifth Grade Sustainability Committee, a group of fifth-grade students who oversee all smaller student-led projects. The Middle School has the Eco-Squad, where the students promote awareness of how an individual can make ‚Äúgreen‚Äù choices and positively affect the environment. This group encourages students and faculty to engage in sustainable acts and sets an example through their garden. Also at the Middle School is a greenhouse where science classes grow seedlings for the SSSAS campuses and to study botany and horticulture. Vegetables, flowers, and herbs are used in both our campus gardens that grow food for area food banks. At the Upper School, there is the Perkins Courtyard. The Perkins Courtyard is home to harvested vegetables and native plants maintained by the upper school students. The vegetables are served in the dining halls of all three campuses. =Recognition= The 2016 Ellen Pickering Environmental Excellence Award has been presented to St. Stephen's & St. Agnes School in Alexandria.

An infielder, Khalifa played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1985 through 1987. He retired from baseball when his father, Rashad Khalifa, was murdered in 1990. Early life Khalifa was born in Fontana, California, while his father, Rashad Khalifa, obtained a Doctor of Philosophy at the University of California, Riverside. As a child, he relocated to the Middle East on two occasions. When he was a few months old, his family moved to Alexandria, Egypt, where his father worked for the Egyptian government. After three years in Egypt, the Khalifas moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where they lived for seven years. They then moved to Tripoli, Libya, as his father consulted for the Libyan government for a year.Brownfield, Paul. \\"Briefly a Rising Star, Forever a Mourning Son,\\" The New York Times, Wednesday, January 2, 2013. Then, his family moved to Tucson, Arizona. Career Khalifa attended Sahuaro High School in Tucson. For the school's football team he played quarterback and was named All-City by the Arizona Daily Star. He received several Division I football scholarship offers to play quarterback. He also played shortstop on the school's baseball team, which won the Class 5A state championship, defeating Phoenix Brophy High School.http://www.azcentral.com/sports/preps/articles/20130314years-after- tragedy-sam-khalifa-back-in-game.html. He was named the Arizona High school Player of the Year in 1982 and also selected to the 1982 All American Baseball Team. Khalifa was chosen by the Pittsburgh Pirates as the seventh overall selection in the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft. Though he signed a letter of intent to attend Arizona State University, Khalifa signed with the Pirates, receiving a $100,000 signing bonus. In 1982, he played for the Gulf Coast Pirates of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League (GCL) and the Greenwood Pirates of the Class A South Atlantic League. In 48 games played for Greenwood, Khalifa had a .305 batting average. He played six games for the GCL Pirates. In 1983, he played for the Alexandria Dukes of the Class A Carolina League and made the All Star team, batting .270 in 103 games, and received five games of playing time for the Lynn Sailors of the Class AA Eastern League. Khalifa spent the 1984 season with the Nashua Pirates of the Eastern League in 1984. He batted .238 in Nashua in 91 games, as he missed playing time when he fractured his wrist on two occasions. Pirates' manager Chuck Tanner wanted Khalifa to begin the 1985 season as a member of the Pirates' major league roster, but Pete Peterson, the Pirates' general manager, decided that Khalifa needed to spend time in Class AAA before he would be ready for the major leagues. Khalifa started the 1985 season with the Hawaii Islanders of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, and after batting .282 for the Islanders, he made his MLB debut on June 25, 1985, replacing the injured Johnnie LeMaster, becoming the sixth player to start for the Pirates at shortstop during the 1985 season. The Pirates began the season with Tim Foli and Rafael Belliard. Foli received his release, while Belliard had been demoted to Hawaii. Jerry Dybzinski received one game at shortstop for the Pirates, who was followed by Bill Almon, and the trade acquisition of LeMaster from the Cleveland Indians. Khalifa recorded six hits in his first eleven at-bats. In his rookie season, he had a .238 batting average across 95 games played. In 1986, Khalifa platooned at shortstop with Rafael Belliard, as Khalifa struggled, batting .185. He was sent down to the minor leagues, and Jay Bell solidified himself as the Pirates' starting shortstop. Khalifa played for the Vancouver Canadiens of the Pacific Coast League in 1987. He split the 1988 season with the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League and the Buffalo Bisons of the Class AAA International League. He again played for Buffalo in 1989. One day, he was five minutes late for the team bus, it left without him, and he returned home to Tucson. Joe L. Brown, the former general manager of the Pirates, arranged a tryout for Khalifa with the San Diego Padres in 1990. Khalifa quit baseball without attending the tryout following the murder of his father. He played 164 games across three seasons in the majors, most as a shortstop. His primary historical importance arises from his status as the first man of Egyptian descent to play major league baseball. He ended his career with a .219 batting average, a .294 on-base percentage, and a .285 slugging percentage. Personal Khalifa's father, Rashad Khalifa, was murdered on January 31, 1990. Islamic extremists opposed to his teachings were connected to it. Trinidad and Tobago national Glen Cusford Francis was arrested in Calgary on April 28, 2009, in connection with the elder Khalifa's murder. Francis was convicted of Khalifa's murder. Khalifa is no longer involved with professional baseball. He currently resides in Tucson, Arizona, where he purchased his parents' house. He coaches both baseball and football at Sahuaro High School. He leased a taxicab for a few years but is no longer doing that.

In 1875, she migrated to Melbourne, Australia aboard the Newcastle with her partner, Alice Moon, and started to teach swimming at the St Kilda Sea Baths, while also winning prizes in swimming competitions at various venues around Melbourne‚Äôs Port Phillip Bay. She had an intense interest in physical fitness and in 1879 opened Melbourne's first women's only gymnasium, in the Queen Victoria Building, which used to stand where the Melbourne City Square is now. Physical fitness for women was a popular idea of the 1880s and the gym attracted many of Melbourne's independent career women, particularly teachers from the city's growing number of private girls' schools. Miss Dick taught the Swedish Ling Method and ran her gym until 1901. Miss Dick and Miss Moon lived at the Melbourne suburb of Brighton.

Built on the success of the title track (#7 US Pop, #2 US R&B; in late 1969) originally taken from M.P.G., and much like Gaye's \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\" after its success, was released with intent to sell albums based on the success of one particular single (a Motown trademark). Gaye was showing signs of disillusionment from the label's powers-that-be mentality but it didn't affect the singer's performance as he gave a powerful vocal in the title track and was especially impressive with his version of The Beatles' \\"Yesterday\\". He achieved some success with a cover version of \\"How Can I Forget?\\" (originally recorded by The Temptations), which just missed out on the US Pop Top 40, making #41, and reached #18 on the R&B; Charts. Its B-side, a cover of Jimmy Ruffin's \\"Gonna Give Her All the Love I've Got\\", made a separate chart entry, and peaked at #67 and #27 on the Pop and Soul Charts respectively. Gaye also recorded a version of Ruffin's \\"Don't You Miss Me a Little Bit Baby\\" for the album. The LP also features Gaye's rendition of the socially conscious tune \\"Abraham, Martin & John\\", which became a hit in the UK, peaking at #9 in June 1970. The single (and that of his duet single with Tammi Terrell titled \\"The Onion Song\\") is widely regarded as a hint of what would follow a year later with his What's Going On.

It always sums up the explicit sexual lyrics used in reggae and dancehall music. Because of this, several of her performances were banned in some parts of Jamaica, though equally lewd male performances were not.

They released four albums: Gamma 1 (1979), Gamma 2 (1980), Gamma 3 (1982) (all on Elektra Records) and Gamma 4 (2000). Some of their best known songs are probably \\"Fight to the Finish\\" from their first album, and \\"Meanstreak\\" and \\"Voyager\\" from the second album. History =Original incarnation (1979‚Äì1983)= Ronnie Montrose put the band together after having released a solo album Open Fire in 1978, after having disbanded the hard rock band Montrose in 1977. Gamma was a far more AOR-oriented band than Montrose, and used a lot of the latest keyboard technology in its sound. The debut album Gamma 1 was released in 1979 and reached No. 131 on the Billboard 200, totalling 17 weeks on the chart. Gamma scored a hit single with \\"I'm Alive\\" which got to No. 60 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The original lineup of Ronnie Montrose (guitars), Davey Pattison (vocals), Alan Fitzgerald (bass), Jim Alcivar (keyboards) and Skip Gillette (drums) recorded this album. Guitarist Montrose, bassist Fitzgerald and keyboardist Alcivar had all been members of the band Montrose. Gamma 2 was issued in 1980. Alan Fitzgerald (who later joined Night Ranger as their keyboardist) was replaced by bassist Glenn Letsch, and Denny Carmassi (another ex-Montrose member) came in on drums. The album had a cover design by Mick Haggerty, featuring two sharks with only their fins visible burrowing through a lawn that was being sprinkled. The album peaked at No. 65, and featured a heavier sound. (e.g. \\"Mean Streak\\" and \\"Cat on a Leash\\"). There was also a cover version of Thunderclap Newman's \\"Something in the Air\\". It was produced by Gary Lyons and Ronnie Montrose. Keyboardist Jim Alcivar was replaced by Mitchell Froom and Gamma 3 was released in 1982. The album reached No. 72 and produced the single \\"Right the First Time\\" which reached No. 77 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 10 on Billboard 's Album Rock Tracks chart. In Canada, \\"Right the First Time\\" peaked at No. 27, making the song the band's only top 40 hit on their national pop chart. The album's opening track, \\"What's Gone Is Gone\\", and tracks like \\"No Way Out\\", were arena rockers, while others like \\"Condition Yellow\\" and \\"Moving Violation\\", continued the odd writing style and sounds that the band started with on their debut album. However, Gamma's label Elektra Records never really promoted the band, and with only moderate sales, they disbanded. =Post- break-up activities= * Ronnie Montrose resumed solo activities, releasing a series of instrumental albums with little success, before reforming Montrose in 1987 with a new lineup. He committed suicide on March 3, 2012. * Davey Pattison went on to sing for Robin Trower, and also sang on two songs on Ronnie Montrose's 1990 solo album, The Diva Station. * Denny Carmassi went on to drum for over a decade with Heart, then played with Coverdale/Page and Whitesnake. In 2002 he joined Foreigner for touring duties. * Mitchell Froom went on to become a record producer in the 1980s and 1990s, producing albums for Elvis Costello, Los Lobos, Crowded House, Suzanne Vega, Paul McCartney, the Del Fuegos, Bonnie Raitt, and many others. * Glenn Letsch went on to work with Monty Byrom in the band New Frontier. He has also performed the bass on Montrose's Mean (1987) album and currently tours with Robin Trower. =Reunion (2000)= Montrose reunited with Pattison in the 1990s and reactivated the band in 2000. The new line-up was Davey Pattison (vocals), Ronnie Montrose (guitar), Denny Carmassi (drums), Glenn Letsch (bass), and Ed Roth (keyboards). Carmassi and Letsch had also played on Gamma 2 and 3; Roth was a new addition to the band. In an interview around the time of the release of Gamma 4 (2000) Carmassi stated \\"For me, it was a chance to play with Ronnie again. I always loved playing with him. There are certain people you \\"get off\\" playing with. I've played with many guitar players over the years, some with big reputations, and Ronnie stands out as one of the best.\\" The group recorded the album Gamma 4 before once again dissolving. =Remastering (2011‚Äì2013)= In 2011, Rock Candy Records, a reissue label in the UK, began remastering and releasing the Gamma catalogue. They started with Gamma 2 which includes 24 bit remastering from original source tapes and extensive liner notes with comments from Glenn Letsch. Gamma 1 was remastered in 2013 by Jon Astley, (who remixed the remasters for The Who) and features a new interview with vocalist Davey Pattison. Gamma 3 includes interview comments from Glenn Letsch, Davey Pattison and drummer Denny Carmassi plus a single edit of \\"Right the First Time\\" as a bonus track. =Gamma (2013‚Äìpresent)= After the death of Ronnie Montrose on 3 March 2012, the original members of Gamma performed to a sell out memorial concert in San Francisco, California. It was here that former Montrose manager/promoter Jim Douglas of Primetime Entertainment suggested that Pattison form a new band. Gamma was reformed with Pattison on vocals, Dan Buch (Butch) on drums, Van Spragins on bass, Tommy Merry on guitar and Brad Barth on keyboards. Notably Gamma performed with Deep Purple in Saratoga, California in the summer of 2014 and with Boston in Lincoln, California in the summer of 2016.

The bulk of his first-class cricket career was spent playing for Tasmanian Tigers. After retiring from representative cricket in Australia, he continued playing for Durham County Cricket Club till July 2012, when he announced retirement from County Cricket. He has also previously played cricket in England for Derbyshire and Sussex. A left hand opening batsman, his form for Tasmania throughout the mid-1990s earned him a call up for the Australian national cricket team in the One Day International arena, although after nine games he was dropped. Like some of his contemporary Tasmanian teammates such as Jamie Cox, Dene Hills, and Shaun Young, Di Venuto can be considered unlucky to have not had a more successful international career, as he was playing at a time when the Australian national cricket team was highly dominant, and difficult to earn selection for. After retiring from Durham, he was appointed Australia's full-time batting coach by head coach Mickey Arthur, and was then head coach of Surrey from 2016 until 2020. Early career Born in Hobart, Tasmania of Italian Australian extraction, Michael Di Venuto attended St Virgil's College, and began his cricketing career representing St. Virgil's Cricket Club. Michael's father, Enrico, and brother,Peter, were also talented cricketers, but were both surpassed by his own ability. Showing his talent from an early age, he soon joined North Hobart Cricket Club, who participate in the Tasmanian Cricket Association's TCA Grade Cricket Competition. It was in that competition that Di Venuto first made a name for himself. His form in the TCA competition soon drew the attention of state selectors, and Di Venuto was selected to make his first-class debut in the 1991‚Äì92 whilst still a teenager. In the 1992‚Äì93 season, he returned to club cricket to find some more experience. His return worked well, and he won the Roger Wolley Medal for man-of-the-match in that season's TCA Grand Final, guiding them to the championship in the process. In that season, he also scored a brilliant innings score of 187 against University, still the second- highest score in Tasmanian grade competitions. Following a move to Kingborough Cricket Club, he again won the award in 1996‚Äì97, helping them to the trophy as well. In all, Di Venuto played in 8 TCA grand finals for both clubs. In 2005‚Äì06, Di Venuto decided to return to the North Hobart Cricket Club where his grade cricket career had begun. Although his first-class career occupied much of his time, Di Venuto has returned to North Hobart occasionally, such as in March 2009, when a superbly-made 111 helped the Demons to victory over Clarence District Cricket Club to reach the TCA Grand Final, although the final was lost to arch-rivals University of Tasmania Cricket Club. First- class career Di Venuto was called up to make his first-class debut against Queensland at the age of 19. In a match played at the Gabba from 13‚Äì16 March 1992, Di Venuto came into the Tasmanian side for the first time. Although not performing exceptionally, his 33 not out showed he had the temperament to move onto the next level, and helped Tasmania to a total of 400/6 declared. The match ended in a draw, but Di Venuto was now in the minds of the Tasmanian selectors. The following season Di Venuto did not feature for his state at first-class level, but returned to grade cricket to refine his technique. The break worked. Di Venuto returned for the 1993/94 season, and scored 678 runs at 37.66, with a high score of 125 a highlight. Di Venuto's return also helped Tasmania qualify for the Sheffield Shield final for the first time ever. They played against the New South Wales Blues at the Sydney Cricket Ground, but the occasion of reaching the final proved too much, with New South Wales won by an innings and 61 runs.http://www.cricinfo.com/australia/engine/match/285500.html The following season he returned figures of 656 runs at 32.80 batting at number four, cementing his spot in the Tasmanian middle order. Di Venuto truly came to the fore in the 1995/96 season. His 791 runs at 43.94 saw him end the season as Tasmania's third most effective batsman, behind only experienced opener Dene Hills, and international legend David Boon. With his regular place in the order assured by the 1996/97 season, Di Venuto regularly moved into the number three spot to cover Ricky Ponting's absence through international duties. Although his form dipped slightly at times during the season under this extra pressure, he still returned 799 runs at 39.95. This was Tasmania's third highest tally for the year, but was well overshadowed by Jamie Cox, who scored a remarkable 1349 runs at 67.45. Along with Ponting (850 at 70.83), they kept the Tiger's in the hunt for another final, although the season fell away with Tasmania finishing fourth. Di Venuto's form in the 1996/97 Mercantile Mutual Cup was just as impressive ‚Äì in five innings he scored 274 runs at 68.50, including a high-score of 129 not out. This was the second highest season tally behind only Queensland Bulls batsman Jimmy Maher, and earned him a call up to the Australian One Day International side. His form for Tasmania in the late 1990s soon drew the attention of English county sides, and he signed for Sussex County Cricket Club for the 1999 season. He scored 1,133 runs for Derbyshire in 2005 but it was not enough to prevent relegation. Di Venuto has made the switch to Durham in readiness for the 2007 season, having served Derbyshire for eight years. Michael DiVenuto moves to Durham Updated 10 October 2006 Upon his first County Championship appearance for Durham in April 2007, Di Venuto carried his bat as the number one batsman throughout Durham's first innings. LV County Championship ‚Äì Worcestershire vs. Durham Di Venuto repeated this feat just three weeks later, scoring a double- century against Kent.LV County Championship ‚Äì Durham vs. Kent In August 2009 Di Venuto hit his highest score of 254 not out against former side Sussex at Chester-le-Street.LV County Championship ‚Äì Durham vs. Sussex Di Venuto's successes with the Tasmanian Tigers have been far greater. His 10,117 at 40.96 see him behind only Jamie Cox (11,812) as Tasmania's all-time leading run scorer. The mainstay of the top of the Tiger's batting order for over a decade, he is Tasmania's leading one-day run-scorer, and has the most \\"50's\\" in Pura Cup history.\\"Di Venuto stalls stellar career\\", ABC News. http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/15/2139012.htm. Accessed 16 January 2008. He is behind only David Boon and Jamie Cox for the most appearances for the Tigers. After 17 seasons representing his state side, and helping them to their first Sheffield Shield title, Di Venuto retired from the Tasmanian side in 2008. On 10 July 2012, he retired from English county cricket. He played a key role in helping Durham win back-to-back first-class County Championship titles, including a huge haul of 1,654 runs with two double hundreds when they won the competition for a second time in 2009. But di Venuto has struggled for runs this season, averaging under 30, with Durham bottom of the First Division table. International career Michael Di Venuto's form in the 1996/97 Mercantile Mutual Cup inspired the Australian national selectors to include him in the Australian squad for a tour to South Africa in 1997. He made his one-day international debut against South Africa in the first match of the one-day series at Buffalo Park, East London. South Africa won the toss and chose to field, and Di Venuto opened the batting alongside Mark Taylor. He took an aggressive approach from the outset, scoring 23 runs off 16 balls, before being caught off the bowling of Jacques Kallis. It was the fourth highest score in an Australian total of 223/9 off 50, but it wasn't enough to stop South Africa winning by 6 wickets.http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64545.html Di Venuto was omitted for the second match, and it didn't help his cause that his replacement, the experienced Mark Waugh scored 115 not out, carrying his bat through the innings to guide Australia to a victory by 7 wickets and level the series 1‚Äì1.http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64546.html Despite Mark Waugh's heroics, Di Venuto was given another chance in the third match, but was disappointingly run out for 13 in a match South Africa won by 13 runs.http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64547.html In the fourth match, he was again run out, this time for 14, but Australia won by 15 runs to again level the series at 2‚Äì2.http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64548.html Faced with a premature end to his international career, Di Venuto needed a big innings in the fifth match of the series, and he provided it. He and opening partner Greg Blewett put on a stand of 93 for the first wicket before Blewett fell. But Di Venuto carried on, scoring 89 off 135 balls, but finally fell a disappointing 11 runs short of a maiden One Day International century. Australia made 258, and won by 8 runs to take a 2‚Äì3 lead in the series, and Di Venuto's top score for the Australians earned him the man-of-the-match award, which later proved to be the highlight of his one-day career.http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64549.html Di Venuto was again omitted from the side for the 6th match, but returned in match seven, where he was only able to produce another disappointing score of 11.http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64551.html Overall the tour to South Africa had produced mixed results for Di Venuto. his top-score of 89 had shown he had the talent to compete at international level, but he had also given his wicket away on more than one occasion, and offered inconsistent scores. The tour had resulted in 150 runs at 30.00 in 5 innings for Di Venuto, the fifth best return of the Australians. It was enough to see him again called up for the start of the 1997/98 Carlton & United Series against South Africa and New Zealand, where he was again asked to open the batting. In game one against South Africa at the Sydney Cricket Ground, he could only manage a score of 1.http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65555.html In match three against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Di Venuto returned his second best career score of 77, and starring alongside Mark Waugh (104 runs) in an excellent opening stand of 156 for the first wicket. In match four the Australians again met South Africa, this time at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, but Di Venuto failed again with only 6 runs. This inconsistency was starting to weigh against Di Venuto, and the press began to doubt his temperament. When he only returned 7 runs against New Zealand in match six at the MCG, Di Venuto was dropped from the side, and he would not return to the Australian side.http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65560.html In four innings during the series Di Venuto had only managed 91 runs at 22.75. In all, Michael Di Venuto represented Australia in nine One Day Internationals, scoring 241 runs at an average of 26.77. He had a high-score of 89 scored against South Africa at New Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, and his only other score of note was 77 against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval. Although a talented batsman, his aggressive, attacking style of play which was shown by his strike-rate of 85.76, led him to give his wicket away cheaply too often, as he sought to go on the offensive early on in his innings. He holds an Italian passport, allowing him to play county cricket without being classed as an overseas player and making him eligible for the Italian national cricket team. He made his debut for Italy 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. His older brother, Peter played five games for Italy at the 2000 European Cricket Championship and two games in the 2002 edition of the tournament. Coaching In 2013, Di Venuto was appointed the Australian national cricket team's full-time batting coach by head coach Mickey Arthur. In January 2016, due to an illness to incumbent coach Darren Lehmann, Di Venuto was appointed senior coach for the T20I series against India. In February 2016 Di Venuto joined Surrey County Cricket Club as head coach, remaining there until 2020.

After a 1667 inheritance agreement in the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, he received the secundogeniture of Brunswick-Bevern, which he ruled until his death.  Life  Ferdinand Albert was born in Brunswick, the fourth son of Duke Augustus the Younger, reigning Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, from his third marriage with Duchess Elisabeth Sophie of Mecklenburg. Raised at his father's residence, the young man received a comprehensive education, with Justus Georg Schottel and Sigmund von Birken among his tutors. After the father's death in 1666, the sons quarreled about the heritage. Eventually, Ferdinand Albert received the palace of Bevern near Holzminden, some feudal rights, and a certain amount of money in exchange for his claims to the government of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, which was to be ruled by his elder half-brothers Rudolph Augustus and Anthony Ulrich. Ferdinand Albert joined the Royal Society in 1665 and was admitted to the Fruitbearing Society by Duke Augustus of Saxe-Weissenfels in 1673. Over the years, however, he grew more and more eccentric, and at some point his brothers had to send a military force to restore order at his palace. He collected many works of art, which later became part of the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum in Brunswick. He died in 1687 at Bevern; his son and successor, Ferdinand Albert II, inherited the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel decades later. Family Ferdinand Albert married Christine of Hesse-Eschwege (30 October 1648 - 18 March 1702), a daughter of Landgrave Frederick of Hesse- Eschwege, in 1667.

It lies superficial to the internal jugular vein in the carotid triangle. Its name means \\"handle of the neck\\" in Latin. Branches from the ansa cervicalis innervate most of the infrahyoid muscles, including the sternothyroid muscle, sternohyoid muscle, and the omohyoid muscle. Note that the thyrohyoid muscle, which is also an infrahyoid muscle and the geniohyoid muscle which is a suprahyoid muscle are innervated by cervical spinal nerve 1 via the hypoglossal nerve. Roots Two roots make up the ansa cervicalis, a superior root, and an inferior root. Ansa cervicalis The superior root of the ansa cervicalis is formed from cervical spinal nerve 1 of the cervical plexus. These nerve fibers travel in the hypoglossal nerve before separating in the carotid triangle to form the superior root. The superior root goes around the occipital artery and then descends on the carotid sheath. It sends off branches to the superior belly of the omohyoid muscle, and the upper parts of the sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles and is then joined by the inferior root. The inferior root of the ansa cervicalis, also known as descendens cervicalis, is formed by fibers from spinal nerves C2 and C3. The inferior root gives off branches to the inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle, and the lower parts of the sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles.

Aerial photography H√°rmashat√°r-hegy (; Its Austrian toponym (\\"Hotter\\") also means \\"Three Border Mountain\\") is the name of a mountain in the city of Budapest, Hungary. Its name comes from the fact that the borders of 3 cities (Buda, √ìbuda, Pesthidegk√∫t) met at this point in the 19th century. Today, these cities have merged into Budapest, but the mountain's name has remained unchanged. However, the border between the II and III districts still bisects the mountain. The mountain is located on the Buda side, at 495 m (1623 ft) above sea level. The mountain is a popular place for hiking, biking and paragliding. In the winter it is also a place for sled riding. There are several trails in the area, but the only one that reaches the top is the blue trail, also known as the Country Blue Trail (Az Orsz√°gos K√©kt√∫ra). At the summit there are television and radio towers, as well as a restaurant. It is often windy at the peak, due to the lack of trees. Snow may linger up to two weeks after the snow in the city has melted. On average, the temperature is a couple of degrees Celsius less than on the Pest side.

A merge module cannot be installed alone, but must be merged into a standard Windows Installer installation during the creation of the installation. Typically, a merge module or a collection of merge modules related by dependencies, installs a software product or portion of a product at runtime. The purpose of merge modules is to let you add self-contained software modules to multiple installations. For example, if there are a number of applications that require a specifically configured component, it would be possible to create a merge module that installs and configures that component. That merge module could then be added to the installation packages of each product that required that particular component. This saves the effort of having to individually add the necessary files, registry entries, and other components to every installation. It also saves time if updates are needed, as instead of updating the installations for all applications, only the merge module is updated, and the installations only need to be rebuilt. Standard merge modules have a .msm file extension. Some merge modules may be configurable merge modules. Such merge modules contain certain values that can be set to specify how the module behaves in your installation. For example, the author of the configurable merge module may allow attributes to be set on components, enable or disable isolated components, specify a bitmap for a dialog, or specify how a custom action is run. Configurable merge modules are supported only by Windows Installer 2.0 or higher. There exist a number of pre-created merge modules which install commonly used Microsoft software packages, such as MDAC, ActiveX controls, MFC, SAPI and DCOM.

It was directed by Lee H. Katzin.AllMovie Film Ventures International, an independent movie production and distribution company rereleased The Stranger on VHS under the title Stranded in Space. As with other films rereleased under the FVI banner, The Stranger's new opening credits featured footage from an entirely unrelated film, in this case the 1983 low-budget science fiction film Prisoners of the Lost Universe.Prisoners of the Lost Universe (1983) - Connections - IMDb  Film synopsis  While on a space mission, NASA astronaut Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) crashes and is hospitalized in quarantine for a long period of time. He is uninjured, although his two fellow astronauts were apparently killed in the crash. Stryker becomes suspicious when he tries to ask why he is being held for so long and can‚Äôt seem to get any reasonable explanation. It turns out that he is being closely observed by Dr. Revere (Tim O'Connor) and government agent Benedict (Cameron Mitchell), while being interrogated in his sleep after being given powerful drugs. Dr. Revere is clearly concerned by the strain of the drugs on Stryker, but is caught between the concern for the patient and his responsibility to the government. Stryker eventually escapes the hospital after almost being shot and killed by the security forces. When trying to make a call to Cape Kennedy at a telephone booth, he is shocked to find that the operator has never heard of it, or even the state of Florida. He hitches a ride and begins to realize that he is not on planet Earth, after seeing subtle differences such as three moons in the sky and discovering that the inhabitants of this planet are all left-handed. Stryker soon visits a book store, where he researches the planet. The twin planet, which is on the far side of the sun and unknown to Earth, is known to its inhabitants as Terra. It has a system of government and citizen comradeship that is alien to Stryker - The Perfect Order. The enforcement of the order is facilitated by a hierarchy of officials who scrutinize their subordinates extremely closely, and by inspirational messages, \\"pep\\" talks to remind citizens of the great family they're part of, and electronic monitoring through technology including telephones, televisions and car radios. The Perfect Order has only been around for about 35 to 40 years, after a terrible war. The order was instituted to foster a sense of family among every person on Terra, to help each other and think of each other and the good of the whole. People with incompatible ideas are removed and reconditioned, and if resistant, executed. Culture has been heavily excised (no concerts in the park), religion outlawed, and alcoholic drinks are viewed as a future target to eliminate. Among its accomplishments, the Perfect Order has eliminated suffering and poverty, and has a vibrant space program. Stryker eventually encounters and befriends Dr. Bettina Cooke (Sharon Acker) and her colleague, Prof. Dylan MacAuley (Lew Ayres). Stryker and Dylan determine to get Stryker aboard a Terran spacecraft about to be launched, with Stryker intending to replace its astronaut and pilot the ship back to Earth. Meanwhile, Benedict tracks down Bettina, uses crude violence in his interrogation of her, and conditions her to help lead him to Stryker. Benedict and his people arrive at the space complex in sufficient time to stop him before the rocket can launch with him aboard. Stryker leads them on a chase through the complex, and the authorities have him cornered while he is close to the liquid oxygen tanks, where nobody dares use guns. Stryker jumps into the ocean while firing at the LOX tanks, setting off a fire. Benedict's lieutenant, Henry Maitland (Steve Franken), feels sure Stryker couldn't have survived, but Benedict will settle for nothing less than proof. Meanwhile, Stryker wades ashore north along the coast, right where the Nelson family is camping. He gives an alias, says his boat capsized, and is welcomed by Tom Nelson to join them for their pleasure trip north. Before following the family to their van, he turns to regard the three alien moons, and remembers Dylan telling him it wasn't impossible that he should get home.Letterboxd  Production  It was produced by Bing Crosby Productions.Rotten Tomatoes The idea of an astronaut landing on a twin planet orbiting the Sun exactly opposite Earth was used in the film Doppelg√§nger (also known as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun), produced four years earlier, in 1969. Chrysler Corporation is listed in the credits at the end of the film for providing the automobiles. A Chevy Van was used toward the beginning of the film, and the bowtie on the grille was accordingly disguised.  MST3K appearance  In June 1991, the film was presented in its Film Ventures International iteration as part of an episode of the movie-mocking television series Mystery Science Theater 3000.\\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\" Stranded in Space (TV Episode 1991) - IMDb See also *1973 in television *Orwellian *The Prisoner-British TV series similar in content References  External links  * * The film on Internet Archive * AllMovie Category:1973 television films Category:1973 films Category:1970s science fiction films Category:American television films Category:American films Category:Counter-Earths Category:Films about astronauts Category:Films about extraterrestrial life Category:Films directed by Lee H.

The organization, originally announced as the NAMI Treatment Action Center in 1997, was subsequently directed by psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey, identifies its mission as ‚Ä≥dedicated to eliminating barriers to the timely and effective treatment of severe mental illness‚Ä≥. The organization is most well-known for proposed laws, policies, and practices in the areas of legally compelled outpatient services or outpatient commitment for people diagnosed with mental illness (also known as assisted outpatient treatment, AOT ). The organization identifies its other key issues as \\"anosognosia, consequences of non-treatment, criminalization of mental illness, psychiatric bed shortages, public service costs, violence and mental illness\\".https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/key-issues TAC has been subject to criticism by mental health advocates to be promoting coercion and forced treatment. History Although according to the TAC website, E. Fuller Torrey, M.D. founded the Treatment Advocacy Center in 1998 as an offshoot of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), other sources indicate that the original name was the NAMI Treatment Action Center. Laurie Flynn, the NAMI director at the time, stated in a press release, \\"It's a national disgrace that, in this age of remarkable progress in brain research and treatment, so many individuals are left out in the cold\\". TAC received initial financial support from Theodore and Vada Stanley, founders of the Stanley Medical Research Institute; TAC was founded as an affiliate organization with a separate executive director and board. The organization operates with funding from the affiliated Stanley Medical Research Institute, a non-profit organization which provides funding for research into bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in the United States. Torrey is currently a member of the Treatment Advocacy Center's board and is executive director of the Stanley Medical Research Institute. The relationship between Torrey and NAMI seemed to sour according to sources, with Torrey being disinvited from NAMI's national convention in 2012 after advocates protested his TAC involvement and promotion of outpatient commitment. Areas of Focus The Treatment Advocacy Center activities and projects include: * Developed a template law for legally mandated outpatient mental health treatment. Released in 2000, the draft text is meant as a legal framework for authorizing court-ordered treatment of individuals diagnosed with mental illness who are determined by the court to meet certain legal criteria around dangerousness to self or others or inability to care for oneself due to a mental illness. * Research and study into public policy and other issues related specific to serious mental illness. * Education of policymakers and judges regarding TAC‚Äôs viewpoint on serious mental illness; TAC‚Äôs opinion is that more legally mandated treatment and increases in hospital beds will improve care. Controversy TAC‚Äôs major focus on legally mandated treatment is opposed by other advocacy groups. The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law in a statement on forced treatment states ‚Äú[n]ot only is forced treatment a serious rights violation, it is counterproductive. Fear of being deprived of autonomy discourages people from seeking care. Coercion undermines therapeutic relationships and long-term treatment.‚Äú Daniel Fischer, founder of National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery, described outpatient commitment as a ‚Äúa slippery slope‚Äù back to the kind of mass institutionalization seen in the 1940s and ‚Äô50s\\".

The Pong Su incident began on 16 April 2003 when heroin was smuggled from the Pong Su, a North Korean cargo ship, onto an Australian beach. Australian military special forces subsequently boarded the Pong Su in Australian territorial waters four days later. The ship was suspected of being involved in smuggling almost of heroin into Australia with an estimated street value of A$160 million. The Pong Su (Î¥âÏàòÌò∏) was a 349-foot (106 m), 3,743-tonne North Korean-owned ocean freighter registered in Tuvalu, a flag of convenience. Three men arrested on shore were convicted of importing heroin; a fourth man from the ship who landed the heroin and was arrested on shore pleaded guilty; the crew were all acquitted and deported; and after being confiscated the ship was destroyed in 2006. Heroin trafficking Operation Sorbet was an international operation by Australian police, who had been conducting surveillance on two people who had entered Australia in March 2003 from China, and a third person who had arrived from China on 9 April, all on tourist visas. On the night of 15 April 2003, Australian Federal Police (AFP) conducted surveillance on two people who rendezvoused with the Pong Su close to shore at Boggaley Creek, near the seaside town of Wye River in Victoria, and followed them to a nearby hotel. The next morning, the two suspects were apprehended after leaving the hotel, and were in possession of two packages containing of pure heroin. A third suspect was arrested later that day in nearby Geelong. The following day, in a search of the beach at Boggaley Creek, police discovered the body of a man of East Asian appearance, close to a dinghy and covered by seaweed. He had been part of a two-man landing party from the Pong Su, but has never been identified. The dinghy had suffered fuel problems in the surf and had capsized landing the heroin, drowning one of the crew. On the same day, the second man from the landing party was apprehended in the immediate area by Victoria Police. He had been unable to get back to his boat and simply remained in the area where the drugs had been landed the night before. The AFP stated that they had been working on Operation Sorbet for several months, including with international peers. In May 2003, a further of heroin in three packages was discovered buried near Wye River, after a search which followed coordinates from a seized GPS device. An additional package of heroin had been lost during the landing. Interception of the ship On the morning of 17 April, a Tasmania Police patrol vessel directed the Pong Su to head for Melbourne after it had travelled east entering the Bass Strait. In the afternoon, the Pong Su advised that it would head for Sydney and was directed to head for Eden. New South Wales Police patrol vessels became involved. In the morning of 18 April, the Pong Su changed direction to the east away from Australia towards international waters at speed with a police vessel having to terminate the pursuit due to rough weather. in the evening, Navy warship HMAS Stuart began tracking the Pong Su. In the morning of 20 April, after a four-day chase, Stuart intercepted the Pong Su south east of Newcastle with the Pong Su complying with most directions. Army Special Operations Tactical Assault Group (TAG) West/East operators boarded by simultaneously fast roping onto the deck from a Seahawk helicopter and from climbing the side onto the deck from three rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs) with the crew compliant. The Pong Su was secured and brought into port in Sydney. Searches of the ship by Australian authorities revealed it had been modified for long voyages and was carrying enough fuel and provisions to travel around the world without needing to enter a port. Some 30 men were arrested and detained. It was alleged that the North Korean government was involved in the manufacture and trade of the drugs. The North Korean government stated the ship was a \\"civilian trading ship\\" and the ship's owner had no knowledge of the illegal cargo. Drug charges =Guilty pleas= The three men arrested on shore pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the importation of a commercial quantity of heroin. They were sentenced to between 22 and 24 years imprisonment. They denied they were from North Korea (but rather from Malaysia and Singapore) or part of the ship's crew.... The fourth man from the landing party, who was a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of heroin.. In 2019, Ta Sa Wong and Yau Kim Lam were released on parole, issued with North Korean passports, and deported to North Korea. =Trial= The captain and crew of the Pong Su were charged with narcotics trafficking. Most significantly, an official of the governing Korean Workers' Party was found on board, linking the drug shipment to Kim Jong-il's government. According to Australian media reports, he had served as senior envoy in North Korea's embassy in China. The Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer called in the North Korean Ambassador to lodge a formal protest. Drug charges were laid against the ship's entire crew. 27 crew members were discharged on 5 March 2004 by a magistrate on the basis that there was insufficient evidence for them to stand trial. While awaiting deportation, the crew were held in Baxter Detention Centre; during which time they were questioned by federal authorities. They were deported from Australia on 24 June 2004. Four senior crew members were kept in Australia to face a jury trial: * Choe Dong-song (ÏµúÎèôÏÑ±), 61, the ship's political secretary * Song Man-seon (ÏÜ°ÎßåÏÑ†), 65, the ship's captain * Lee Man-jin (Ïù¥ÎßåÏßÑ), 51, the first officer * Lee Ju-cheon (Ïù¥Ï£ºÏ≤ú), 51, the chief engineer All four crew members pleaded not guilty at the beginning of their trial in August 2005. The prosecution case against the four North Korean officers was that they would not have allowed their ship to be stopped in the position it was if they were not aware that the real purpose of their voyage was to smuggle the heroin. The prosecution did not allege any official involvement of the North Korean government, only the officers on board the ship. On 2 March 2004, the United States Department of State released a report using the incident to link Kim Jong-il's government to drugs trafficking. On 5 March 2006, a Supreme Court of Victoria jury found the ship's four officers not guilty on all charges. They were subsequently deported. Fate of the Pong Su After capture the ship was brought to Sydney Harbour where it was originally moored at Garden Island naval base. From there it was taken to Snails Bay and moored for over two years, where it was reportedly costing over $2,500 a day for maintenance and security. It was taken to Chowder Bay in early 2006 while authorities decided what to do with it. Authorities eventually decided to scuttle the ship. On 23 March 2006, in a joint Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Royal Australian Navy military exercise, the Pong Su was sunk by two GBU-10 Paveway II laser- guided bombs dropped from RAAF General Dynamics F-111C aircraft. The deliberate destruction of the freighter was said to deliver a strong message to international drug smuggling rings that the Australian Federal Police and Commonwealth Government would take all measures necessary to stop illegal drug importation. Before the ship was scuttled, its radio was removed and donated to the Kurrajong Radio Museum.

The two sisters were raped and then murdered by a group of four men, who also attempted to murder the sisters' cousin. Marlin A. Gray (September 29, 1967 ‚Äì October 26, 2005) was convicted of aiding and abetting and was executed by the U.S. state of Missouri by lethal injection. His conviction was for being a part of the group of four men involved in the murders. Gray continued to protest his innocence saying that although he was at the bridge at the time, he was smoking cannabis in a nearby car. On December 9, 1992, Gray was convicted of aiding and abetting and was executed on October 26, 2005. He maintained his innocence to the end. In 2017, DNA evidence proved he was an active participant in the crimes.  The events of April 4‚Äì5, 1991  On the night of April 4/morning of April 5, 20-year-old Julie Kerry, 19-year-old Robin Kerry, and their 19-year-old cousin, Thomas Cummins, were on the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River. Gray, Antonio Richardson, Reginald Clemons, and Daniel Winfrey went to the bridge that night together. The two groups, who did not know each other, had a brief conversation. Gray showed the other group how to climb down a manhole cover on the bridge down to the pier. Then the two groups separated. = The prosecution's version of the events = According to testimony offered on behalf of the prosecution, several minutes later the group of four men decided to rob the three, with Winfrey testifying that Gray said he \\"felt like hurting somebody.\\" They returned and Gray told Cummins that \\"This is a robbery. Get down on the ground.\\" The two girls were grabbed and held on the ground. Richardson held Julie down while Clemons raped her and then the two swapped positions. Gray, Richardson, and Clemons then alternately raped Robin and Julie. Cummins was then robbed of his wallet, wristwatch, cash, and keys, and the three victims were forced down the manhole cover to the concrete pier. The two Kerry sisters then were pushed, and Cummins jumped as instructed. Medical witnesses testified that Cummins and Julie Kerry survived the fall to the water below. Cummins testified that after surfacing, the current pulled him over to Julie, but then she drifted off after he began to drown. Cummins swam to shore and survived. The body of Julie Kerry was found three weeks later near Caruthersville, Missouri; the body of Robin Kerry was not found. = Gray's version of the events = Gray's version of the events was very different. In an interview in 2005, he said that after parting from the group of three, Gray went to a car where he smoked marijuana, while Richardson went to retrieve a flashlight (stolen by Richardson from a police officer's residence) he had left on the bridge. Gray returned to the bridge 30 minutes later to find that the girls and their cousin were gone. Richardson said that Cummins had said the girls had slipped off the bridge but thought the authorities would not believe this story. Cummins was then robbed by the men of his belongings. The version given by Gray at his trial was different, and also differs from what police said that he told them in his initial interview. On returning after 30 minutes in the car, Clemons informed him that \\"Man, I just robbed that guy and threw him and the girls into the river.\\"  Trial and appeals  Police initially refused to believe Thomas Cummins' version of the events. They theorized that the other men never existed and he had made up the story to cover up his attempted rape of his cousins. They believed Julie had fallen off the bridge while resisting his sexual advances, Robin had jumped in to save her, and both had drowned. Thomas was initially charged with murder but released due to lack of evidence. He later won a settlement from the St.Louis police department for wrongful interrogation techniques. Daniel Winfrey, who was 15 years old at the time, confessed to the murder in the presence of police and his parents. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and forcible rape and testified against the other three in their trials. He received a 30-year sentence. He testified that Clemons and Richardson were the ones who had pushed the two girls. Winfrey was the only white member of the convicted group, which has been raised as a criticism since he was the main prosecution witness. Winfrey was granted parole in the summer of 2007; when released, he had served 15 years. Clemons was sentenced to death but his conviction was overturned in 2015. On December 18th, 2017, Clemons plead guilty to five counts: two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of rape and one count of first degree robbery. He was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. Richardson was also given a death sentence, however, it was commuted to life in prison by the Supreme Court of Missouri on October 28, 2003. The court cited his sentencing by a judge rather than a jury to be in violation of Apprendi v. New Jersey (a case that was decided long after the imposition of sentence). Richardson had been the focus of strenuous efforts by death penalty opponents due to his alleged mental deficiencies and because of his age at the time of the murders, even though his own psychologist and his mother testified that he \\"know[s] the difference between right and wrong.\\" In 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that executions of persons who committed their crimes as juveniles were unconstitutional.  Execution  Gray's execution date was set by the Missouri Supreme Court for September 26, 2005. Governor Matt Blunt denied Gray clemency on October 25 based on a recommendation by the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole. That same day, the Supreme Court of the United States denied his motions to stay his execution. Gray asked that no member of his family witness the execution, which he described as \\"murder,\\" although a female cousin and a minister were present. The only witness for the victims present at the execution was Kevin Cummins, the uncle of the two girls. Gray also made no last meal request and gave no instructions for the disposal of his body. His final statement: \\"I go forward now on wings built by the love and support of my family and friends. I go with a peace of mind that comes from never having taken a human life. I forgive those who have hardened their hearts to the truth and I pray they ask forgiveness, for they know not what they do. This is not a death, it is a lynching.\\"  New evidence  Reginald Clemons was awarded a new trial in 2015. Prosecutors presented new evidence that proved Gray was on the bridge during the crimes. Clemons' guilty plea states \\"DNA from Clemons and a co- defendant, Marlin [Gray], indicative of sexual activity was found on pants Gray wore during the crime\\". For his plea, Clemons was given five consecutive life sentences, without the possibility of parole, instead of the death penalty. Chain of Rocks Bridge Memorial  Media  The murder of Julie and Robin Kerry was the subject of a 2005 episode of American Justice entitled \\"The Bridge Murders\\". Thomas Cummins' sister Jeanine Cummins wrote a memoir about the murders entitled A Rip in Heaven.

Its catchment lies within the Gold Coast and Scenic Rim Region local government areas and covers an area of . The river provides potable water for the town of Beaudesert. Course and features Formed by the confluence of the Right and Left Branches of the river which begin in the Lamington National Park and drain the northern slopes of the Border Ranges within the Great Dividing Range, the Albert River rises below Neglected Mountain and east of the settlement of . The river flows generally north, joined by six minor tributaries before reaching its confluence with the Logan River between and . From there the Logan flows a further before entering Moreton Bay. The Albert River catchment is bounded by the McPherson Range to the south, the Beechmont Range in the east and the Jinbroken Range and Birnam Range to the west. The river's upper catchment is heavily influenced by the national parks of Tamborine, Main Range and the Lamington Plateau, and numerous local government-owned reserves and conservation areas, that comprise part of the Shield Volcano Group of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. Tributaries of the Albert River include the Stockyard Creek, Duck Creek, Kerry Creek, Cainbable Creek, Canungra Creek and Bidaddaba Creek. The Albert River is crossed by the Pacific Motorway, the Old Pacific Highway, and the Gold Coast railway line at . History Yugembah (also known as Yugumbir, Jugambel, Jugambeir, Jugumbir, Jukam, Jukamba) is one of the Australian Aboriginal languages in areas that include the Albert River, Gold Coast, Logan, Scenic Rim, Beaudesert, Beenleigh, Coolangatta, Coomera, Logan River, Pimpama, Tamborine and Tweed River Valley, within the local government boundaries of the City of Gold Coast, City of Logan, Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Tweed River Valley. Mununjali (also known as Mananjahli, Manaldjahli and Manandjali) is a dialect of the Yugambeh language. The Mununjali language area includes landscape within the local government boundaries of the Scenic Rim and Beaudesert Shire Councils. The river was named by Robert Dixon in honour of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Floods have been recorded on the Albert River in 1925, 1947, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1989 and 2017 (Cyclone Debbie). In 1884, the S.S. Walrus ran aground on the bank of the river. The vessel had been used as a floating sugar mill and distillery. =Proposed dam= In 1989, the Goss Government rejected a proposal to build Wolffdene Dam on the Albert River. Later, a dam near Glendower Homestead was once planned in a Queensland Government water strategy report from 1990. The option was discarded after it was revealed the site was too costly to build a dam for the amount of water it would have provided. Environmental concerns The water quality of the Albert River remains in relatively good condition until it merges with the Logan River where the quality declines. Residential and industry development and land clearing in the catchment have deteriorated the water quality of the Albert River, particularly in its lower reaches. Key environmental issues that face the catchment are rapid population increase and development; altered flow patterns of the creek causing active erosion; deteriorating water quality; increased noise and vehicle movements; waste disposal; invasion of bushland by exotic plants and animals; management of the extractive industries; and day-to-day behaviour of residents and workers of the catchment.

It is the successor to the TI SR-52, quadrupling the number of \\"program steps\\" of storage, and adding \\"ROM Program Modules\\" (an insertable ROM chip, capable of holding 5000 program steps). Just like the SR-52, it has a magnetic card reader for external storage. One quarter of the memory is stored on each side of one card. The TI-58 (May 1977), and later TI-58C (1979), are cut down versions of the TI-59, lacking the magnetic card reader and having half the memory, but otherwise identical. Although the TI-58C uses a different chip than the TI-58, the technical data remain identical. The \\"C\\" in a TI (or Hewlett-Packard) model name indicates that the calculator has a constant memory (or continuous memory, respectively) allowing retention of programs and data when turned off. These calculators use a parenthesized infix calculation system called \\"Algebraic Operating System\\" (AOS), where, compared to the postfix RPN system used by other scientific calculators (such as HP), the operator enters calculations just as they are written on paper, using up to nine levels of parenthesis. The calculator can be powered from an external adapter or from internal NiCd rechargeable battery pack (although the battery has to remain present when using the external AC adapter to avoid damage to the calculator circuitry).  Display  10-digit LED display The red LED display shows 10 decimal digits of precision.  Programming  Programming simple problems with the TI-59 or TI-58 is a very straightforward process. In programming mode, the TI-59 simply records key presses. Alphabetical keys provide easy access to up to ten entry points. It is also possible to activate any of the programs in the pre-programmed memory module, and run one like any user-written program. Programs written by the user can also use programs in the module as subroutines. The module's programs run directly from ROM, so they leave the calculator's memory free for the user. However, exploiting the computer-like capabilities of the TI-59 is a different matter. Although the TI-59 is Turing-complete, supporting straight- line programming, conditions, loops, and indirect access to memory registers, and although it supports limited alphanumeric output on the printer only, writing sophisticated routines is essentially a matter of planning machine language and using a coding pad. A large degree of sharing occurred in the TI-59 and TI-58 community. At least one game, Darth Vader's Force Battle, appeared as a type-in program. = Programming example = Here is a sample program that computes the factorial of an integer number from 2 to 69. For 5!, you'll type 5 A and get the result, 120. Unlike the SR-52, the TI-59 or TI-58 don't have the factorial function built-in, but do support it through the software module which was delivered with the calculator. Op-code Comment LBL A You'll call the program with the A key STO 01 stores the value in register 1 1 starts with 1 LBL B label for the loop * multiply RCL 01 by n DSZ 1 B decrements n and back to B until n=0 = end of loop, the machine has calculated 1*n*(n-1)*...2*1=n! INV SBR end of procedure Here is the same program written for TI Compiler: TI User, programs on line, TI Compiler page., Utilisateur TI, programmes en ligne, page de TI Compiler #reg 01 counter #label A factorial LBL factorial STO counter 1 FOR counter * @counter LOOP = RTN #end  Memory  In comparison to its contemporary main competitor, Hewlett-Packard HP-67, the TI-59 has about twice the memory. The partition between program steps and memories is adjustable in increments of 80 program steps/10 memories, and as many as 960 program steps (with zero memories) or as many as 100 memories (with 160 program steps) can be configured. The TI-59 was the first programmable pocket calculator where the manufacturer provided a system for sharing memory between data registers and program storage. The memory is only about twice as large as in the SR-52, but more flexible, and thus the possible number of program steps was four times as high. Contents of this memory are lost when the calculator is turned off. The TI-58 has half the memory of the TI-59 and supports up to 480 program steps or 60 memories. It competed with the HP-34C. The TI-58 and TI-59 calculators have variable length instructions. Some keypresses are merged into one programming step, so that instructions from one to eleven keypresses are stored in one to six programming steps. The HP-67 always stores one instruction in one programming step, which is efficient for some frequently used instructions but also limits the number of possible instructions.  Magnetic card reader  right The TI-59 can store programs and data on small magnetic cards when the calculator is turned off and quickly reloaded when needed. Click below for a video of the card reader in action. The video also shows the dual use of the magnetic card as a program documentation menu. Notes can be printed or handwritten by the programmer on the top side of the magnetic card. Once read by the cardreader, the card can then be stored, as shown, in a slot between the top of the keyboard and the display, thus providing a notation indicating both the name of the program currently loaded and the purpose of each of the five label buttons A-E and their secondary functions A'-E' within the loaded program. The TI-58 does not have a magnetic card reader.  Solid State Software Library  The Master Library Module shown removed from its socket in the back of the calculator. Magnetic card storage folio also shown. The TI-59 and TI-58 were the first hand-held calculators to utilize removable ROM program modules. The Master Library Module ROM was included with the TI-59 and TI-58, and contains several useful pre-programmed routines and even a game. Additional modules - for such applications as real estate, investment, statistics, surveying and aviation - were sold separately. The programs in the modules used the user-defined keys heavily. To make the programs easier to use, plastic cards with the same size as the magnetic cards, but just printed to label the user-defined keys, can be inserted in the slot between the display and the keyboard to label the user- defined keys.  Printer  TI-59 mounted on a PC-100A Also available for the TI-59 and TI-58 was a thermal printer (the PC-100A, B, and C models); the calculator was mounted on top of the printer and locked in place with a key. The calculator can be programmed to request input from the user, and output results of calculations to the printer. Alphanumeric text (64 characters total, including space, 0-9, A-Z and 25 punctuation and mathematical symbols) can be output as well as numbers. A limited ability to plot graphs is provided. The printer is also valuable for program development because it can produce a hard copy of the calculator's program including the alphanumeric mnemonics instead of just the numeric codes normally visible on the display, as well as a dump of the data registers, a trace of the program's execution and other information about the program. In the early model PC-100A, a switch inside the battery charger compartment allows use with the earlier SR-52 and SR-56 calculators as well as the TI-58/59 series. In addition, it also works with non-programmable TI machines of the era such as the SR-50A. (Remove the battery pack of a TI calculator and look for the row of printer interface pads on the circuit board below the battery terminals.)

Water is added to the jar to maintain the liquid level as the alcohol is sipped. Lao-Lao () is a Laotian rice whisky produced in Laos. Along with Beerlao, lao-Lao is a staple drink in Laos. Etymology Contrary to what the romanized transcription would lead one to think, the name lao-Lao is not the same word repeated twice, but two different words pronounced with different tones: the first, ‡ªÄ‡∫´‡∫•‡∫ª‡ªâ‡∫≤, means \\"alcohol\\" and is pronounced with a low-falling tone in the standard dialect, while the second, ‡∫•‡∫≤‡∫ß, means Laotian (\\"Lao\\") and is pronounced with a high(-rising) tone. Taste Quality, taste and alcohol concentration vary by source of the drink. However, all variations are strong. Lao satoe, the white liquid by-product from lao-Lao production, is also drunk and it has a very yeasty and sweet taste. Production and consumption Although lao-Lao is traditionally drunk neat, a cocktail that is rising in popularity is the \\"Pygmy Slow Lorange\\", named after the pygmy slow loris, a species endemic to Laos. Various flavoured lao-Laos are made by macerating such additives as honey or scorpions. It is women who often distill lao-Lao and sell it as a source of income locally, often being their second major income. Lao-Lao sold on retail is usually clear, but amber colored varieties exist too. It is traditional to serve two glasses of lao-Lao on ceremonies, feasts and other comparable situations. The drink is customarily expected to be drunk with a single gulp. A less powerful version of lao-Lao, called lao-hai, , and is drunk from large communal earthenware pots (hai) through long bamboo straws.

Harvard The Southeast corner of the park Williams Park is a park located in St. Petersburg, Florida. It is the city's first park and encompasses an entire city block between 4th and 3rd Streets North and between 2nd and 1st Avenues North. Founded in 1888 and originally named \\"City Park,\\" it was changed to Williams Park in honor of the co-founder of St. Petersburg, John Constantine Williams Sr.. The park is the center of the downtown business district and has been the venue for numerous political and civic rallies and celebrations for more than one hundred years. In 1964, Richard Nixon used the bandstand to speak to a large group gathered in the park on behalf of then presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Many downtown workers flock to the park in good weather for picnics during their lunch breaks. At one time, the park was surrounded by prestigious department and retail stores. In the past 25 years, most of them have moved away to malls and other areas away from the city center. The bandstand plays a prominent role in the park and one has been there since 1894. The modern bandstand in the park was designed in 1954 by St. Petersburg architect William B. Harvard, whose work also includes the St. Petersburg Pier. In 1955 it was the recipient of the Award of Merit from the American Institute of Architects. It is used for outdoor concerts during the noon hour and on weekends, but for groups which tend to attract smaller crowds. Williams Park has also known as the city's homeless park, although less-so since the city relocated bus shelters in 2018.

The Goto-gumi, as an affiliate of Japan's largest yakuza organization, the Kobe- based Yamaguchi-gumi, was seen as a vanguard for Yamaguchi expansion into the Kant≈ç region. The gang achieved notoriety the following year when five of its members assaulted and seriously injured Japanese filmmaker Juzo Itami. The attack was in retaliation for Itami's negative portrayal of the yakuza in his film Minbo no Onna. On October 14, 2008 Goto was expelled from the Yamaguchi- gumi and the Goto-gumi was split into two parts, headed by Mr. Rachi and Mr. Tsukamoto, two of Goto's chief executives.

A tap dancer since the age of four, Imel later took up playing the marimba. He appeared in clubs and concerts in and around his hometown right through elementary and high school. Later, with the advent of the Korean War, Imel joined the U.S. Navy and considered a career as a sailor, but towards the end of his tour of duty he was stationed in San Diego. He made the trip up to Los Angeles to audition for the television show of bandleader Lawrence Welk. He was invited to join the cast of the show, and cemented his status on it in his debut performance in 1957. After Imel spent about three months on the show, the Welk Show began receiving mail saying that he was \\"conceited\\" and a \\"show-off.\\" To rectify the situation, Welk suggested that Imel take a place in the band, since all soloists on the show came from the band. Since the marimba was not designed to be a part of the orchestra, Jack was given unique percussion instruments to play, such as bells, the triangle, and the maracas. With this development, fans began to somewhat accept Imel. Imel's career as a producer began with the hiring of tap dancer Arthur Duncan in 1964. With two hoofers on the show, Imel decided he needed to diversify, and began pitching production ideas. The show brass found them interesting, and he was invited to the production meetings; eventually, he became a full- fledged associate producer of the show. Beginning in the 1970s, he was paired with Mary Lou Metzger in specialty song and dance routines. Singing posed some difficulty until Imel was taught a speech-like technique similar to that used by Rex Harrison and James Cagney. Imel also became known for wearing animal costumes in various numbers, alongside dancer Bobby Burgess. After retiring from the Welk organization in 2006 and from performing entirely two years later, Jack continued to be involved in entertainment as part of the audition committee for the City of Porterville City of Hope Spectacular. Family Jack Imel and Norma Jean Denney were married on November 29, 1951, and their marriage lasted until Jack's death. He is survived by Norma and their five children.

The Wuyi region produces a number of well-known teas, including Lapsang souchong and Da Hong Pao. It has historically been one of the major centers of tea production in Fujian province and globally. Both black tea (excluding brick tea) and oolong tea were likely invented in the Wuyi region, which continues to produce both styles today. Wuyi teas are prized because of the distinctive terroir of the mountainsides where they are grown. Because of the lower yield produced by tea bushes in such terrain, the resulting tea can be quite costly. Tea made from the leaves of older bushes is particularly expensive and limited in quantity. Da Hong Pao, collected from what are said to be the original bushes of its variety, is among the most expensive teas in the world, and more valuable by weight than gold. Commercial-grade tea grown at lower elevations in the area accounts for the majority of the Wuyi tea available on the market. Commercial Da Hong Pao is made from cuttings of the original plants. History Tea plantation in Wuyi Mountains, Fujian, China During the Song dynasty, the Northern Park () tea estate in Fujian's Jian'ou was the most important supplier of tea to the Song emperors. Established as a private estate under the Min Kingdom, it was nationalized under the Southern Tang and remained so under the Song. It continued to supply compressed cakes of \\"wax tea\\" (lacha) to the emperors of the subsequent Yuan dynasty. When the Hongwu Emperor, founder of the Ming dynasty, proclaimed in 1391 that the elaborate and labor-intensive process of producing wax tea \\"overtaxed the people's strength\\" and decreed that all imperial tribute tea was to be in the form of loose leaves rather than cakes, tea production collapsed at the Northern Park. The center of the tea industry in Fujian subsequently shifted west to the Wuyi region. In the 16th century, farmers in Wuyi began growing tea and indigo on the mountains themselves, often on estates owned by Buddhist or Taoist monasteries. The farmers cut terraces into the slopes, and built a system of dikes and drains. During the Ming dynasty, monks at Songluo Mountain () in Anhui developed a new technique for stopping the oxidation process of tea, pan-firing the leaves in a dry wok rather than steaming them as had been done previously. Songluo-style green tea became popular, and the new production method spread to other regions. In the 16th century, Wuyi tea makers invited monks from Songluo to teach their techniques to them. Eventually they discovered that by allowing the tea to partially oxidize before firing, they could produce a darker, fragrant type of tea which came to be known as oolong (w≈´l√≥ng, \\"black dragon\\") tea. =Export to the West= European merchants began purchasing tea in Canton (Guangzhou) during the 17th century. Because green tea formed the bulk of their imports, and because the Wuyi region was initially the main source of the darker teas available to them, the term \\"Bohea\\" (based on the local Min Chinese pronunciation of \\"Wuyi\\") became a blanket name in English for all dark teas; the modern designations \\"black\\" and \\"oolong\\" were not yet in use. Over time, distinctions began to be made between different dark teas. Lapsang souchong, a Wuyi tea and possibly the first black tea to be produced, was separately traded as \\"Souchong\\" for a higher price, while the highest quality black tea was given the name \\"Pekoe\\" (), referring to the downy white hair on the young leaves). The term \\"Bohea\\" came to mean black tea of the lowest quality. During the 18th century, Western consumer preferences shifted from green tea toward black tea. The price of black tea dropped significantly during this period, making it more affordable to a larger number of consumers. Bohea tea was consumed in larger quantities than any other type of tea in Europe. When the Ostend Company began competing against the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the British East India Company (EIC) by importing cheap Bohea tea, the VOC responded by shifting its trade away from green tea toward larger quantities of black tea, mostly Bohea. Because Bohea from the VOC was cheaper than the EIC's tea offerings, consumers in Britain's American colonies illegally smuggled Dutch Bohea in large quantities. The Tea Act of 1773, intended to help the ailing EIC sell its tea in America, instead led to resistance culminating in the Boston Tea Party. The majority of the tea dumped in Boston Harbor was Bohea (Wuyi) tea, along with some Souchong and Congou. In 1848, the Scottish botanist Robert Fortune went to China on behalf of the British East India Company to obtain tea plants as part of their ongoing effort to establish a tea industry in colonial India. At the time, it was illegal for foreigners to travel inland in China, away from the five treaty ports designated by the Treaty of Nanjing. Fortune therefore went in disguise as a Chinese official, visiting tea producing regions across China. He stole and smuggled out a number of tea plants and seeds from the Wuyi Mountains, and learned from the monks there the full process of planting, picking, and processing the leaves to make tea. He was also able to hire a number of Chinese workers to assist with tea production in Darjeeling. Characteristics Wuyi teas are generally dark, spanning the range between black teas and darker oolongs, and are typically twisted into thin strips rather than curled into a ball shape like Anxi or Taiwan oolong teas. They are fired heavily, as were most oolong teas historically, and have a characteristic smoky flavor with notes of stone fruit.

It was discovered on 8 June 1999, by members of the LINEAR team at the Lincoln Laboratory Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, United States. The highly eccentric unusual object measures approximately in diameter. It was named Dioretsa, the word \\"asteroid\\" spelled backwards.  Classification and orbit  Dioretsa is a member of the damocloids, with a retrograde orbit and a negative TJupiter of ‚àí1.547. It is also a centaur, as its orbit has a semi-major axis in between that of Jupiter (5.5 AU) Neptune (30.1 AU). The Minor Planet Center lists it as a critical object and (other) unusual minor planet due to an orbital eccentricity of more than 0.5. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.4‚Äì45.4 AU once every 116 years and 10 months (42,686 days; semi-major axis of 23.9 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.90 and an inclination of 160¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Its observation arc begins 12 months prior to its official discovery observation, with a precovery taken by Spacewatch at Steward Observatory in June 1998. Currently, its orbit still has an uncertainty of 2. = Retrograde orbit = An inclination of greater than 90¬∞ means that a body moves in a retrograde orbit. Dioretsas orbit is otherwise similar to that of a comet. This has led to speculation that Dioretsa was originally an object from the Oort cloud.  Naming  The minor planet's name \\"Dioretsa\\" is the word \\"asteroid\\" spelled backwards, and is the first numbered of currently 99 known minor planets with a retrograde motion in the Solar System. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 May 2003 ().  Physical characteristics  According to observations made with the 10-meter Keck Telescope, Dioretsa measures 14 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo of 0.03. It has an absolute magnitude of 13.8. As of 2018, Dioretsas spectral type as well as its rotation period and shape remain unknown.

Problem description Assume a cigarette requires three ingredients to make and smoke: tobacco, paper, and matches. There are three smokers around a table, each of whom has an infinite supply of one of the three ingredients -- one smoker has an infinite supply of tobacco, another has paper, and the third has matches. There is also a non- smoking agent who enables the smokers to make their cigarettes by arbitrarily (non-deterministically) selecting two of the supplies to place on the table. The smoker who has the third supply should remove the two items from the table, using them (along with their own supply) to make a cigarette, which they smoke for a while. Once the smoker has finished his cigarette, the agent places two new random items on the table. This process continues forever. Three semaphores are used to represent the items on the table; the agent increases the appropriate semaphore to signal that an item has been placed on the table, and smokers decrement the semaphore when removing items. Also, each smoker has an associated semaphore that they use to signal to the agent that the particular smoker is done smoking; the agent has a process that waits on each smoker's semaphore to let the agent know that it can place the new items on the table. A simple pseudocode implementation of the smoker who has the supply of tobacco might look like the following: def tobacco_smoker(): repeat: paper.wait() matches.wait() smoke() tobacco_smoker_done.signal() However, this can lead to deadlock; if the agent places paper and tobacco on the table, the smoker with tobacco may remove the paper and the smoker with matches may take the tobacco, leaving both unable to make their cigarette. The solution is to define additional processes and semaphores that prevent deadlock, without modifying the agent. Argument Patil placed the following constraints on the cigarette smokers problem: #The agent code is not modifiable. #The solution is not allowed to use conditional statements. Patil used a proof in terms of Petri nets to claim that a solution to the cigarette smokers problem using Edsger Dijkstra's semaphore primitives is impossible, and to suggest that a more powerful primitive is necessary. However, David Parnas demonstrated that Patil's proof is inadequate if arrays of semaphore are used, offering a solution that uses helper processes that do arithmetic to signal the appropriate smoker to proceed. According to Allen B. Downey, the first restriction makes sense, because if the agent represents an operating system, it would be unreasonable or impossible to modify it every time a new application came along. However, Parnas argues that the second restriction is unjustified: > The limitations reported by Patil are limitations of his primitives, but > they are not limitations on the primitives described by Dijkstra. ‚Ä¶ It is > important, however, that such an investigation [of Dijkstra primitives] not > investigate the power of these primitives under artificial restrictions. By > artificial we mean restrictions which cannot be justified by practical > considerations. In this author's opinion, restrictions prohibiting either > conditionals or semaphore arrays are artificial.

Founding  = Mary Lowther Ranney = Westridge founder Mary Lowther Ranney (1871-1939) moved to Pasadena in 1904 when she was 34 years old. A trained architect and educator, she had graduated from Kemper Hall Academy in Kenosha, Wisconsin, attended classes at the newly established University of Chicago, and taught at the University School for Girls in Chicago. Soon after arriving in Pasadena, Ranney's family purchased a lot at 440 Arroyo Terrace, where they would build a house designed by Ranney herself. Ranney worked for many years with the Greene and Greene architectural firm, and taught privately in Pasadena. Before long, two Pasadena mothers‚ÄîMargaret Brackenridge and Alexander Duer‚Äîbegan planning a school for girls near the Arroyo Seco, and Ranney was their choice of headmistress. = College preparatory school = From day one, Ranney intended for Westridge (so named for its location on the \\"west ridge\\" of town) to be a school that prepared girls for college‚Äîa novel idea in 1913, when most girls did not attend college. Almost immediately, enrollment exceeded expectations. Ranney intended for Westridge to be located at the home she shared with her parents on State Street, but as a result of the overwhelming registration of 21 students during the summer of 1913, the Ranneys acquired a larger house on Madeline Drive and opened the doors of Westridge. Campus history and highlights Madeline Court connects to Foreman Courtyard on the north side of the Westridge campus Today, the Westridge campus provides an idyllic park-like setting in a residential neighborhood. The campus is distinguished not only by its welcoming beauty, but also by an unusually rich architectural heritage. The main building, designed by Marston, VanPelt & Maybury and built in 1923 on the site of the original school, houses classrooms, administrative offices, and one of the school's four technology centers. The Burgess Exhibition Gallery in the main hall features student art exhibits throughout the year. Herrick Quadrangle, behind the main building, is bordered with both historic and contemporary architecture. Adjoining the main building are the Joan Irvine Smith '36 Academic Research Center and Braun Music Center, which is home to the Howard S. Swan Choral Hall. The Fran Norris Scoble Performing Arts Center opened in 2005.The Braun Music Center was designed in 1909 by architect Frederick L. Roehrig, also known for designing the Green Hotel and the Tournament of Roses House in Pasadena, as a private gymnasium and theatre for a family living on Orange Grove Boulevard. In 1958, Westridge parent Henry Dreyfuss added a larger and more functional stage to Braun Music Center. Three other significant buildings on the Quad were designed by Pasadena architect Whitney R. Smith: the Seeley G. Mudd Science Building, with three fully equipped Upper School laboratories and a computer technology center, the Laurie and Susan Frank Art Studio and the Hoffman Gymnasium. The Richard N. Frank Athletic Field and Ranney Lawn provide recreational spaces for all grades. In 1997, the school began a building program to enable the campus to better serve the needs of Westridge students and the space demands of an expanded, modern curriculum. Pica & Sullivan Architects designed the Marjorie May Braun '36 Science Building and the Karsh Family Science Garden that contain science classrooms and outdoor study spaces specifically designed for Lower and Middle School students. In April 2000, Westridge dedicated the Anne F. and James F. Rothenberg Humanities Center. The three-building complex also designed by Pica & Sullivan Architects, contains humanities classrooms and faculty offices, Upper School art studios and photography labs, art and photography exhibition space, the school's largest technology lab, and the Herrick Commons dining room.leftIn 2004, Westridge unified the north and south campuses with the creation of Madeline Court. The following year brought the addition of the Rokus Athletic Complex where Tiger soccer and softball teams host games on new regulation fields. Dance is taught in Brown Studio and athletes take advantage of the Studenmund weight-training room. In 2005, the Fran Norris Scoble Performing Arts Center opened. The facility includes a 600-seat auditorium, the Wagener Black Box Theater and the Seiter Family Amphitheater. The oldest and most architecturally significant building sits on the southeast corner of the campus. Pitcairn House, built in 1906 by the architectural firm of Greene and Greene, is a classic example of the California Bungalow style and is often pictured in books on the architecture of that period. Pitcairn House is the location of the school's business, communications, and advancement offices. It was previously the location of the art department.  Faculty and administration  Elizabeth J. McGregor became the school's 11th head of school on July 1, 2008. There are also two academic division directors on the administrative team: a director of Upper School and a director of Lower & Middle School. Westridge has 75 faculty members, and more than half of them have over ten years of teaching experience. Two-thirds of Westridge faculty hold advanced degrees (with 14% holding doctoral degrees). The college counseling office is staffed by four counselors. School traditions Westridge has seen a number of traditions come and go throughout its century of existence. Some of the most beloved (and still in existence today) are: * All School Day. All School Day is a day that occurs in the spring during which the Associated Student Body (ASB) organizes activities, food, and a movie for the entire school to relax and have fun. The day's theme is announced at a special assembly that morning. Previous themes have been \\"Disneyridge,\\" \\"All Around the World,\\" \\"British Invasion,\\" and \\"Time Warp Westridge.\\" * Greek and Roman. At the beginning of each school year, all new students, faculty, and staff are initiated in Westridge‚Äôs longstanding tradition of either becoming a Greek or a Roman. If a relation of a student attended the school earlier, the student will be placed in whichever group her relation was in. It is a lighthearted rivalry with fun and games at the beginning of each year in a sorting ceremony. Points are awarded throughout the year through various activities and a trophy is presented at the end of the school year to whichever side has garnered the most points. * Junior Ring Ceremony. The first annual Ring Ceremony was held in 1936 and to this day occurs every April. During this ceremony, the junior class receives their class rings, which are embossed with the school seal, containing the school‚Äôs founding date (1913), the school motto Surgere Tentamus, the oil lamp, and ivy. The Each girl receives her ring from the Head of School and a white rose from the Mistress of the Rings, a member of the junior class who found the golden ring in the annual Ring Cake Ceremony (which occurs prior to the Ring Ceremony). This ceremony marks the juniors' passage into being seniors. * Yam Festival. In November, the school holds the annual Yam Festival, where parents and students bring yam dishes originating from places all around the globe. This tradition began in 1998 to help represent the African-American community at Westridge and has become something every student enjoys and looks forward to. * Holiday Concert. Before winter break, Westridge holds a Holiday Concert in which girls from the Lower School chorus, Middle School chorus and orchestra, and Upper School Glee Club and orchestra perform holiday music. The fourth graders always have a special song to perform, which is kept a secret until the day of the concert. * Senior Skits. The last assembly before winter break is known as the \\"senior skits\\" assembly, where the senior class prepares a comedic sketch of lighthearted impersonations of teachers to entertain the school community. * Big and Little Sisters. Students from all grades participate in Big and Little Sisters, where students are assigned into a \\"Family.\\" Families meet every few months to participate in activities to bond, like making Christmas cards. This tradition is a way for younger students to develop friendships with older students. Big Sisters are seen as role models for Little Sisters. The families are now assigned based upon girl's Greek/Roman affiliation, and they continue each year (as girls graduate, new students join their families). The families traditionally meet once at the beginning of the year, again before holiday break, and once during the spring. * Petridge. On the last day of school, students are invited to bring their pets to campus as part of this Lower School learning project and pet-friendly community fundraiser that benefits animal welfare organizations. * Vespers. Vespers (also called \\"Senior Vespers\\") is a year-end event the evening before Commencement held for seniors and their families to celebrate their time at Westridge. Traditionally, there is a keynote speaker who either was selected by the class or has served as a class adviser. Students also perform musical numbers, poetry, and more during the event. *Homecoming. Each year, the week following winter break, the Athletic Department hosts Homecoming which is an amazing tradition for alumna to return to campus to cheer on their fellow tigers in a variety of sports competitions. It is a great way for alumna to return and be completely immersed in the tiger spirit and reminisce on their experiences at Westridge. *Junior Senior Chant. Directly following each assembly or all school gathering, as the grades are dismissed one by one, the Junior and Senior classes take turns chanting at each other. The seniors begin, juniors follow, and seniors finish, ending the whole experience with \\"Seniors rule!\\" *Senior Privileges. Once achieving senior status at Westridge, preceded by good behavior, seniors are granted their senior privileges. This grants students the flexibility to go off campus during free periods and breaks. They also are allowed to wear college sweatshirts to class, and flip flops and open toe shoes whenever they please. Finally, seniors are given free dress every friday and have senior breakfast once a month where parent volunteers provide a feast for students before school on that Friday morning.  Uniform  The primary aspects of the Westridge uniform feature a khaki skirt and white, sleeved shirt. Upper school students also have the option to wear shirts and sweatshirts from on-campus student organizations. The formal uniform includes a white pleated skirt and the traditional button up shirt that has the Westridge ivy logo on the pocket. The formal uniform is worn once or twice a year for Convocation and other special occasions.  Interim  Interim is an opportunity for students that happens the week before spring break. This grants students the availability to take their studies outside of the classroom and possibly travel to different parts of the world, country, or even city and county of Los Angeles. The trips are announced to the Upper School in the Interim Booklet and students are asked to rank and submit the trips. Through a lottery system, taking into account seniority, students are placed on trips to different places all over. The trips are international, domestic, and local and incorporate a variety of experiences to give students a well rounded experience. These trips occur the week before spring break and are a great travel opportunity.  Student groups and organizations  = Clubs and affinities = Clubs and affinity groups at Westridge join girls with similar interests together to share knowledge, spread passion, and affect change. Students lead and participate in a wide range of clubs including: Alliance, Amnesty International, Animal Club, Art, Asian Culture, Chess Club, Classic Films & TV, Girls Who Code, Green Guerillas, Help Africa, Junior Classical League (Latin), Korean Culture, LINK (Liberty in North Korea), Math Club, Model United Nations, Red Cross, Science Olympiad/Robotics, Speech & Debate, Spyglass (student newspaper), Students for Social Justice, Theater Club, UNITY, Water Warriors, World Issues Club, Young Democrats, Young Republicans, and Zine Club. Affinity groups include: Black Student Union, Christian Affinity, Latin Affinity, LGBTQ Affinity (or \\"Skittles\\"), Middle Eastern Affinity, Muslim Affinity, and more. = Student Voices = In addition to clubs and affinities, there are many groups at Westridge dedicated to creating spaces for discussion among the student body. One such group is Westridge Student Voices, a student-led leadership group that addresses topics related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice. Student Voices is composed of Affinity Heads and Student Diversity Leadership Conference (SDLC) and White Privilege Conference (WPC) delegates. With a focused group of students, Student Voices raises awareness about local and global issues and events through assemblies, town meetings, and lunch talks. = Westridgettes = Another beloved student group on campus is the Westridgettes. Known for their Tigers spirit and their green skirts embellished with puffy paint (bearing the names of students who have previously worn them), the Westridgettes are the student cheer squad that performs with the tiger mascot at assemblies and school events. Each Westridgette's skirt represents a different theme or aspect of the school, and there are currently 12 Westridgette skirts that align with athletics, drama, dance, prep, the Tiger mascot, and various student affinity groups. The Westridgettes have a long history at Westridge, with their origins in the late 1970s. Previously (in the mid-1970s), the Westridgettes were called the \\"Tigettes,\\" and wore orange t-shirts, green gym shorts, and tiger feet.  Summer Opportunities FairSummer Opportunities Fair, Westridge School  In early spring, Westridge hosts the annual Summer Opportunities Fair (SOF), a community service event founded in 1991 that provides a venue for parents and children to learn about summer programs. SOF is free and open to the public, and local, national, and international program options are available for girls and boys, pre-K through 12th grade. The fair, held on the Westridge campus, attracts over 2,000 people each year.

Directed by Barry W. Blaustein, it was produced by the Farrelly brothers. The film was released on December 23, 2005 by Fox Searchlight Pictures.  Plot  Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) hates his job but after over two years of working, receives a promotion. His first duty is to fire his friend Stavi (Luis √Åvalos), who is the janitor. Steve reluctantly does so, but hires him to work around his apartment. Stavi gets three fingers cut off in a lawn-mower accident, and reveals that he does not have health insurance. Steve must raise $28,000 within two weeks to pay for the surgery to re-attach his friend's fingers. His uncle Gary (Brian Cox), owes $40,000 in gambling debts and suggests that they fix the Special Olympics in San Marcos, Texas in order to solve both of their financial problems. Steve, who competed in track and field in high school as well as being in the drama club, reluctantly enters the Special Olympics in the guise of a high functioning young man with a developmental disability named Jeffy Dahmor. Gary, assuming that Steve will easily defeat the legitimate contenders, bets $100,000 that reigning champion Jimmy Washington (Leonard Flowers) won't win the gold medal. Despite initially being disgusted at pretending to be mentally challenged, Steve goes along with it for Stavi. During the competition, Steve falls in love with Lynn (Katherine Heigl), a volunteer for the Special Olympics. During this time, six of the other contestants bust Steve after seeing through his ruse, so he tells them about what happened with Stavi. As Steve decides to pack up and leave for his ruse being exposed, they tell Steve to stay, since they want to help Steve save Stavi's fingers and they hate the egotistical, arrogant champion Jimmy and want to see him lose. After much training, Steve actually sees some improvement. At the final competition, Steve does not actually win; his friend Glen (Jed Rees) does, with Steve coming in third behind Jimmy. During the medal ceremony Steve admits that he isn't developmentally disabled, reveals his actual name, and that he does not deserve his medal. He then gives his medal to Thomas (Bill Chott), who had finished fourth. Uncle Gary still ends up winning his bet, since the condition was that Jimmy would lose. Lynn, upset at being deceived, slaps Steve despite his attempts to apologize. Six months later, Steve has quit his job and is working in theater, helping produce a play with the friends he made during the Special Olympics, as well as Stavi, who got his fingers reattached. Glen and the others trick Lynn into coming to the theater, so Steve starts to apologize. Lynn already forgives him because Stavi told her why Steve pretended to be developmentally disabled. Steve is relieved, and they kiss. In a mid-credits scene, Steve and his friends dance onstage with the Kids of Widney High as they perform the song \\"Respect\\".  Cast  * Johnny Knoxville as Steve Barker * Brian Cox as Gary Barker * Katherine Heigl as Lynn Sheridan * Jed Rees as Glen * Bill Chott as Thomas * Edward Barbanell as Billy * Leonard Earl Howze as Mark * Geoffrey Arend as Winston * John Taylor as Rudy * Luis Avalos as Stavi * Leonard Flowers as Jimmy Professional wrestlers Terry Funk and Jesse Ventura's cameo appearances came about due to their friendship with director Barry Blaustein, who met the pair whilst filming wrestling documentary Beyond the Mat in the late 1990s. Funk portrayed one of the debt collectors, while Ventura lent his voice as a motivational speaker on tape.  Production notes  The film took seven years to get made due to its controversial subject. The Special Olympics committee eventually agreed to endorse the film, the film makers having given them final say on the script. Producer Farrelly is himself a longtime volunteer with Best Buddies, a group that provides mentoring program for people with intellectual disabilities, and has prominently featured characters with disabilities in his previous films such as Warren the brother of Mary in There‚Äôs Something About Mary and Rocket in Stuck on You. During the end credits, scenes from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet are shown being performed, ending with the Kids of Widney High performing Aretha Franklin's \\"Respect.\\"  Reception  The film-review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes lists 40% positive reviews based on 88 critics, with an average rating of 4.8 out of 10. The site's consensus states: \\"Despite a few laughs and good intentions, The Ringer is too predictable to really score the points it aims for.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating: \\"The movie surprised me. It treats its disabled characters with affection and respect... and it's actually kind of sweet.\\"Ebert, Roger. \\"The Ringer (PG-13).\\" Chicago Sun Times, 22 December 2005. Spinal Cord Injury Zone stated: \\"Instead of tugging at the heartstrings, The Ringer uses the typical outrageous Farrelly Brothers humor (There's Something About Mary, Stuck on You, Shallow Hal) to promote the message that just like everyone else, individuals with intellectual disabilities are people first, each with their own interests, talents, abilities and personalities. The movie also features more than 150 people with intellectual disabilities in small parts and supporting roles.\\" Soundtrack # \\"Ton of Shame\\"- Written by: Randy Weeks...Performed by: Randy Weeks # \\"Mr. Sandman\\"- Written by: Pat Ballard # \\"Sweet Ride\\"- Written by: Gustaf Nor√©n and Bj√∂rn Dixg√•rd...Performed by: Mando Diao # \\"Wink and a Nod\\"- Written by: Tom Wolfe...Performed by: The Funny Bones # \\"Merlot\\"- Written by: Tom Wolfe...Performed by: The Tasters # \\"Real Thing\\"- Written by: Tom Wolfe...Performed by: The Shakers # \\"Main Title- Written by: Elmer Bernstein...Performed by: Elmer Bernstein # \\"Calvera\\"- Written by: Elmer Bernstein...Performed by: Elmer Bernstein # \\"Hot Sugar\\"- Written by: Sammy James Jr. and Graham Tyler...Performed by: The Mooney Suzuki # \\"Girls Gone Wild\\"- Written by: Karlyton Clanton, Rochad Holiday and Chris Reese...Performed by: Dirty Rat # \\"We Got to Get You a Woman\\"- Written by: Todd Rundgren...Performed by: Todd Rundgren # \\"If She Wants Me\\"- Written by: Sarah Martin, Stuart Murdoch, Richard Colburn, Mick Cooke (as Michael Cooke), Christopher Geddes, Stevie Jackson (as Stephen Jackson) and Bob Kildea- Performed by: Belle & Sebastian # \\"Piano Man\\"- Written by: Billy Joel # \\"My Cherie Amour\\"- Written by: Stevie Wonder, Sylvia Moy and Henry Cosby # \\"Kellerman's Anthem\\"- Written by: Michael Goldman # \\"Fox Sports Network College Basketball Theme 2001\\"- Written by: Christopher Brady # \\"September\\"- Written by: Allee Willis, Al McKay and Maurice White...Performed by Earth Wind & Fire # \\"Pretty Girls\\"- Written by: Carl Brown, Shelly Goodhope, Tanesa Tavin, Daniel Brattain, Veronica Mendez, Darrell Mitchell, Albert Cota, Chantel Roquemore and Michael Monagan...Performed by: The Kids Of Widney High # \\"Respect\\"- Written by: Otis Redding...Performed by: The Kids Of Widney High # \\"You Are Everything\\"- Written by: Linda Creed and Thom Bell (as Thomas Bell)...Performed by: The Stylistics See also * Spain at the 2000 Summer Paralympics * Special Olympics * Ableism References External links * Category:2000s sports comedy films Category:2005 films Category:Down syndrome in film Category:American independent films Category:American films Category:Films about mental disability Category:Films scored by Mark Mothersbaugh Category:Fox Searchlight Pictures films Category:Special Olympics Category:2005 independent films Category:Films directed by Barry W.

Sahra Choueifat A 2005 MIT study by Hiba Bou Akar which analyzed the access to cheap housing by Shiites who had lived through two displacement (Lebanese civil war, and post 1992 reconstruction of the suburbs) gave rise to three findings: First, the monetary compensation received by displaced squatters after the war was, in theory, adequate to allow them to get legal housing in Beirut; however the implementation was unstable and led the families to bind their resources to vacant apartments before they could move to them. Second, political parties' intervention in the phase of compensation, as well as in the housing market of Sahra Choueifat, managed to acquire better housing and tenure rights for those who were displaced, but gave rise to religious pockets within a religiously sensitive area. Moreover, the use of legal tools by contesting groups such as voting, zoning, and manipulation of public services in Sahra Choueifat, is resulting in the division of space in a political manner; define a group‚Äôs space and excluding others. This is causing these families to move again in yet another, third phase of displacement, from Sahra Choueifat to more Shiite-dominated suburbs. Bou Akar, H. (2005).

The Ruwais industrial and housing complex has been developed by ADNOC as a major contributor to the national economy and represents a series of multimillion-dollar investments by the company. Once a small fishing headland from which a handful of people scratched a seasonal living, Ruwais today is one of the most modern industrial complexes in the Middle East. In the 1970s, plans were laid to transform a remote desert site into a self-contained industrial town, geared to fulfilling the downstream requirements of Abu Dhabi's booming oil and gas industry. Centered on Takreer's Ruwais Refinery, the complex was officially inaugurated in 1982 by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the late President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and the visionary behind Abu Dhabi's remarkable development and prosperity. In addition to the original -per-day refinery, which was expanded in 1985 with the commissioning of a hydro cracker complex, major facilities at Ruwais include a natural gas liquids fractionation plant operated by Abu Dhabi Gas Industries Ltd (GASCO), a fertilizer plant run by Ruwais Fertilizer Industries (FERTIL), a Petrochemical Complex by Abu Dhabi National Polymers Company (Borouge), a marine terminal and a sulfur handling terminal. Ruwais has also been developed into a model 'new town' with an evolving population. The Ruwais Housing Complex, covering an area of , is located away from the industrial plants. The complex has its own shops, schools, banks, mosques, clinic and hospital, and a wide range of sporting and leisure amenities including a beach club and an 'in-house' TV station. Although originally designed to house the workers who support the oil and gas industry, Ruwais has grown to include other government workers of nearby projects, such as Barakah Nuclear Power Plant. Climate Gulf The climate of Ruwais is similar to Abu Dhabi, which is a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh). July is the hottest month, with average maximum temperatures above 40¬∞C. Sandstorms occur intermittently, in some cases reducing visibility to a few meters. On average, January is the coolest month in the year. Since the Tropic of Cancer passes through the emirate, the southern part falls within the Tropics. However, despite the coolest month having a average, its climate is far too dry to be classed as tropical. =Ruwais Mall= On January 29, 2014, the first ever mall in Ruwais was inaugurated. It consists of a department store and a grocery shop. The branch of these shops is Lulu Hypermarket. It has two well-known fast food restaurants - KFC and Pizza Hut. For children, there is a bowling centre and an arcade. Near the bowling center lies Cine Royal, the mall's cinema. 3D cinemas show the latest releases. Two shops for sports franchises have been built, Athletic's Co. and Sun and Sand Sports Co. These shops sell products from worldwide companies such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok, Dunlop, and Wilson. Starbucks Coffee is a store which is located outside the main entrance. Shops are: *Sara Jewellery *Malabar Gold and Diamonds *Shoe Mart *Makyaji *Splash *LuLu =RHC Hospital and Clinic= A purpose-built local, modern general hospital opened in 2012 to cater for medical, clinical and dental needs of residents. The hospital is administered by the Medical Services Division of the Administration Directorate. Ruwais Hospital is a 36-bed acute-care facility providing the full range of general and emergency medical services, including cardiology, maternity, pediatrics, dentistry and ophthalmology, on both an outpatient and inpatient basis. The emergency department, staffed by highly skilled medical officers and well-trained nurses, is open 24 hours a day and operates a round-the-clock ambulance service, not only for ADNOC employees and their families but the whole of the immediate neighborhood. Ambulance crews are on hand, for example, to attend LO road accidents along the highway between Tarif and Sila. The RHC Clinic is now fully integrated with Ruwais Hospital, and provides a comprehensive health-care programme to all residents of the housing complex. It offers a wide range of general practitioner and specialist services, including nursing and child welfare, immunization and vaccination, school health, dental and physiotherapy services. Ruwais Housing Complex is managed by Ruwais Housing Division, part of the ADNOC Administration Director. For specialist medical services, many residents are often obliged to travel the for an appointment with other health professionals. =Schools= Education in Ruwais consists of 2 main types of schools, those are Public and Private School, including one university (The Higher Colleges of Technology for Girls and Boys, or HCTGB)). The Main Private Schools are: * Adnoc Schools (formerly known as The Glenelg School of Abu Dhabi) * The International School of Choueifat (SABIS) * The Asian International School (AIS) The Main Public Schools are: * Al Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib Primary And Secondary School for Boys (AABAMPSSB) * Amrah Bint Abd Al Rahman Secondary School for Girls (ABAARSSG) * Nahrawan Primary School for both boys and girls.

H. Townsend's illustration from The Misfortunes of Elphin (1897) Gwenhwyfach (, , or ; sometimes anglicized to Guinevak) was a sister of Gwenhwyfar (Guinevere) in medieval Welsh Arthurian legend. The tradition surrounding her is preserved in fragmentary form in two Welsh Triads and the Mabinogi tale of Culhwch and Olwen.  Gwenhwywach  This relatively obscure figure is first mentioned in Culhwch and Olwen, where her name (spelled Gwenhwyach) is among those 200 men, women, dogs, and horses invoked by the hero Culhwch to punctuate his request that King Arthur help him find his love Olwen. Both of the Triads that mention Gwenhwyfach refer to the enmity between her and her sister that led to the Battle of Camlann. Triad 53 lists as one of the \\"Three Harmful Blows of the Island of Britain\\" the slap that Gwenhwyvach gave her sister that caused the Strife of Camlann. Identifying Camlann as one of Britain's \\"Three Futile Battles\\", Triad 84 mentions it was started because of a dispute between the sisters. Some have suggested that \\"Gwenhwyfach\\" in Triad 53 is a mistake for \\"Medrawd\\" (Mordred), since Triad 54 describes Medrawd raiding Arthur's court and throwing Gwenhwyfar to the ground and beating her; this interpretation does not explain Triad 84, however. Rachel Bromwich notes, citing the spelling found in Culhwch and Olwen and Triad 84, that Gwenhwyach may in fact be the original spelling of the name.Bromwich, Rachel, Trioedd Ynys Prydein, 3rd Ed. University of Wales Press, 2006, p. 376. Melville Richards and Bromwich previously suggested that the alternate spelling of her name in medieval Welsh sources, Gwenhwywach, could have been understood as Gwenhwy-fach, or \\"Gwenhwy the Lesser\\", a back-formation based on a false etymology of her sister's name as Gwenhwy-fawr, meaning \\"Gwenhwy the Great\\".Richards, Melville, \\"Arthurian Onomastics\\", in: Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, vol. 2, 1969, p. 257.Collins, Morris. \\"The Arthurian Court List in Culhwch and Olwen\\". The Camelot Project at the University of Rochester. Retrieved 3 January 2013. It is possible that Gwenhwyfach was once thought of as a darker aspect of Gwenhwyfar.  False Guinevere  \\"How King Artus slept each day with the Lady of Camelide and promised to marry her.\\" An illustration from alt= The Lancelot-Grail cycle introduced a possibly related character known as \\"the False Guinevere\\" or \\"Guinevere the False\\". Named Genievre, she is the real Guinevere's identical but evil half-sister by a different mother. Also known as the Lady of Camelide (Dame de Camelide), she bewitches Arthur and turns him against the real Guinevere. She later dies of disease, confessing on death bed. (In the non- cyclical Lancelot, she confesses and is then burned after Lancelot wins a trial by combat against her three champions.)  Modern stories  Some modern writers associate Gwenhwyfach with Mordred, presumably due to her association with Camlann; she appears as the traitor's wife in Thomas Love Peacock's novel The Misfortunes of Elphin (1829), for example. In Bernard Cornwell's Enemy of God (1996), she is Guinevere's delusional and dim-witted fat sister who aids Arthur in his supposed \\"rescue\\" of Guinevere from Lancelot's castle, and later goes completely insane while living alone waiting for Lancelot to arrive.

They are regarded as founding fathers of the so- called \\"Nardcore\\" punk movement. History The band was started by Kyle Toucher, Ismael Hernandez, and Robin Cartwright in early 1981, and after auditioning a few singers, local Silver Strand Beach surfer/skater and punker Brandon Cruz was chosen. Silver Strand Beach in Oxnard, California was the birthplace of Nardcore. The band recorded studio versions of several early songs with Cruz, which led to television appearances and gigs on the Los Angeles circuit. However the early momentum was somewhat derailed by escalating inner turmoil which culminated in Cruz leaving the group in 1983, leaving Toucher to take over vocals just as the band was starting recording of Plug In Jesus for Mystic Records. Several more albums followed, including the Burn EP, This Island Earth, and Wreckage in Flesh, which were subsequently released on Death Records/Metal Blade, signaling a shift to a crossover direction in their sound. For This Island Earth, the lineup was founding member Kyle Toucher on vocals and guitars, drummer Rik Heller and bassist Ismael Hernandez. Before an American tour for This Island Earth with Scottish street punks The Exploited, Ismael Hernandez quit the band and was replaced by ex-St√§l√§g 13 members, bassist Tony Black and second guitarist Tim Harkins. After another short U.S. tour and attempt at writing a new album, Rick Heller quit the band before moving to Scotland, where he joined The Exploited and drummer Larry White was brought in to finish writing and begin recording of what would become Wreckage in Flesh. During this period Tony Black was replaced by Mike Purdy and the album was finished April 1988. Two subsequent tours followed in support of the album with bands such as The Circle Jerks, D.R.I., Murphy's Law, 7 Seconds as well as shows with up and coming thrash metal bands Forbidden, Vio-lence, Holy Terror, and Metal Church. Dr. Know disbanded to pursue other projects in 1991. Since that time Slayer covered the Toucher penned \\"Mr. Freeze\\" on their Undisputed Attitude album. The Dr. Know song \\"Piece of Meat,\\" written by Toucher and Cruz, is used on the 1998 (season two) South Park episode entitled \\"Clubhouse.\\" In 1998, Cruz called Hernandez and together they approached Toucher to get the band back together. Toucher declined, but Hernandez and Cruz recruited others and embarked on a North American tour with big-name punk acts of the time. In September 2001, Cruz was asked to sing with old friends, the reunited Dead Kennedys, leading to a gig that lasted until April 2003. Dr. Know still managed another record, entitled Father, Son, and Holy Shit! and toured the West Coast with St√§l√§g 13 and Ill Repute. Dr. Know released their last record in 2009, on Unrest Records, entitled \\"Killing For God.\\" Cruz, Hernandez, and the Contreras cousins, Rick and Steve, all wrote the record, recorded in Santa Cruz, California. May 2010, Dr. Know with Hernandez and Cruz played a final gig. This version of the band played 2 more special gigs in Santa Cruz, Ca., and in Oakland, November 25 and 26, 2011, as well. Founding member, and the 6th and 8th vocalist and songwriter Kyle Toucher, now works as a visual effects and digital artist in Los Angeles, CA. He has done work on TV series such as Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek Voyager as well as in movies such as Serenity and Van Helsing. Toucher has won two Emmys for his work. On August 18, 2010 Brandon Cruz posted the official end of his and Hernandez' version of Dr Know. The same day that Brandon Cruz announced the breakup of the punk Dr. Know, Kyle Toucher announced the reformation of the Wreckage in Flesh era line up. Called The Real Dr. Know featuring Kyle Toucher, the lineup is Toucher, Mike Purdy, Tim Harkins, and Steve \\"El Steevo\\" Morrison. As of late 2011, the Toucher-led Dr. Know has reformed and have played a few successful West Coast gigs. Brandon Cruz is still playing punk rock and is also a photographer, business owner, consultant, and healer. A metal version of the band with Toucher, featuring Toucher, died sometime in 2015. Dr. Know gave birth to KNOW, in November 2016. Known as KNOW, ex members of the band playing the punk music of Dr. Know, began rehearsing with Cruz, Hernandez, Larz White, ex drummer from the metal era, and Fred Mattaquin, the 2nd guitarist on the Burn ep. KNOW planned to go to Europe with St√§l√§g 13 to begin the Nardcore Summer Tour on July 22, 2017. It was to start off with a festival in Copenhagen with Discharge. Brandon, Ismael, Fred Mattaquin, and Larry White, all ex-original members, are now playing as DR. KNOW.

SJN is a non-preemptive algorithm. Shortest remaining time is a preemptive variant of SJN. Shortest job next is advantageous because of its simplicity and because it minimizes the average amount of time each process has to wait until its execution is complete. However, it has the potential for process starvation for processes which will require a long time to complete if short processes are continually added. Highest response ratio next is similar but provides a solution to this problem using a technique called aging. Another disadvantage of using shortest job next is that the total execution time of a job must be known before execution. While it is impossible to predict execution time perfectly, several methods can be used to estimate it, such as a weighted average of previous execution times. Shortest job next can be effectively used with interactive processes which generally follow a pattern of alternating between waiting for a command and executing it. If the execution burst of a process is regarded as a separate \\"job\\", past behaviour can indicate which process to run next, based on an estimate of its running time. Shortest job next is used in specialized environments where accurate estimates of running time are available.  Weighted shortest job first  Weighted shortest job first (WSJF) is a modification of the concept used in agile development where jobs get weighted with the cost of delay so that the highest valued jobs get done sooner.

Brawling was covered in ecclesiastic courts until 1860. It has rarely been prosecuted since then. History During the early stages of the Reformation in England religious controversy too often became converted into actual disturbance, and the ritual lawlessness of the parochial clergy very frequently provoked popular violence. To repress these disturbances the Brawling Act 1551 was passed in 1551, by which it was enacted: \\"that if any person shall, by words only, quarrel, chide or brawl in any church or churchyard, it shall be lawful for the ordinary of the place where the same shall be done and proved by two lawful witnesses, to suspend any person so offending, if he be a layman, from the entrance of the church, and if he be a clerk, from the ministration of his office, for so long as the said ordinary shall think meet, according to the fault.\\" An Act of 1553 added the punishment of imprisonment until the party should repent. The Brawling Act 1551 was partly repealed in 1828 and wholly repealed as regards laymen by the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860. Under that Act, which applies to Ireland as well as to England, persons guilty of riotous, violent or indecent behaviour, in churches and chapels of the Church of England or Ireland, or in any chapel of any religious denomination, or in England in any place of religious worship duly certified, or in churchyards or burial-grounds, were liable on conviction before two justices to a penalty of not more than ¬£5, or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two months. This enactment applied to clergy as well as to laity, and a clergyman of the Church of England convicted under it could also be dealt with under the Clergy Discipline Act 1892 (Girt v. Fillingham, 1901, L.R. Prob. 176). When Mr J. Kensit during an ordination service in St Paul's Cathedral \\"objected\\" to one of the candidates for ordination, on grounds which did not constitute an impediment or notable crime within the meaning of the ordination service, he was held to have unlawfully disturbed the Bishop of London in the conduct of the service, and to be liable to conviction under the Act of 1860 (Kensit v. Dean and Chapter of St Paul's, 1905, L.R. 2 K.B. 249). The public worship of Protestant Dissenters, Roman Catholics and Jews in England had before 1860 been protected by a series of statutes beginning with the Toleration Act of 1689, and ending with the Liberty of Religious Worship Act 1855. These enactments, though not repealed, were for practical purposes superseded by the summary remedy given by the Act of 1860. In Scotland disturbance of public worship is punishable as a breach of the peace (Dougall v. Dykes, 1861, 4 Irvine 101). =In the British Empire= In British possessions abroad, interference with religious worship was usually dealt with by legislation, and not as a common-law offence. In India it was an offence voluntarily to cause disturbance to any assembly lawfully engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies (Penal Code, s. 296). Under the Queensland Criminal Code of 1899 (s. 207) penalties were imposed on persons who wilfully and without lawful justification or excuse (the proof of which lies on them) disquiet or disturb any meeting of persons lawfully assembled for religious worship, or assault any forces lawfully officiating at such meeting, or any of the persons there assembled. =In the United States= In the United States disturbance of religious worship is treated as an offence under the common law, which is in many states supplemented by legislation (see Bishop, Amer. Crim. Law, 8th ed. 1892, vol. i. s. 542, vol. ii. ss. 303-305; California Penal Code, s. 302; Revised Laws of Massachusetts, 1902, chap. 212, s. 30.). \\\\-- (Dissenting correction to the above) Modern case In 1998, Peter Tatchell of OutRage! was prosecuted for interrupting the Archbishop of Canterbury's Easter sermon with a short gay rights speech. The 1860 legislation (which transferred jurisdiction away from the ecclesiastic courts) was used to try him; his defense focused on the Human Rights Act 1998. He was convicted and fined ¬£18.60 (referring to the 1860 legislation) plus court costs.

The Naturaliste Plateau formed during the Early Cretaceous 136 Ma when Australia and India broke up and during the Late Cretaceous 83 Ma when Australia and Antarctica broke up. Lavas and intrusive rocks on the plateau flanks have ages of between 132-128 Ma. The eastern flank of the plateau slopes relatively gently, while the other three flanks are relatively steep. The southern flank formed during the Australia-Antarctica break-up, the other flanks during the rifting between India and Australia. The continent ocean transition (COT) is wide on the north side and on the southern side where the plateau is flanked by the Diamantina Fracture Zone. Before India broke off from Australia-Antarctica at 127 Ma the Naturaliste Plateau was flanked by what would become two microcontinents, the Batavia and Gulden Draak Knolls, now located on the western margin of the Perth Abyssal Plain from Australia. South of the plateau, during some 45 Ma after India and the two knolls broke off, rifting occurred between the plateau and the Bruce Rise, now located off Antarctica. This rifting continued until sea-floor spreading began 83 Ma. Continental metamorphic and granitic basement rocks have been dredged from both knolls. Protolith granite from Gulden Draak was emplaced in either the Australian Yilgarn Craton or the Antarctic Mawson Craton 2850 Ma. The Mesoproterozoic crust from this knoll is coeval with crust from the Naturaliste Plateau. Neoproterozoic-Cambrian (540‚Äì530 Ma) granite gneisses from the Batavia Knoll were emplaced during or after the formation of the Kuunga Orogen.

The land around Beauly is fertile - historically corn was grown extensively and more recently fruit has successfully been farmed. The town historically traded in coal, timber, lime, grain and fish. History Arms of the Community Council =Early years= Beauly is the site of the Beauly Priory, or the Priory Church of the Blessed Virgin and John the Baptist, founded in 1230 by John Byset of the Aird, for Valliscaulian monks. Following the Reformation, the buildings (except for the church, which is now a ruin) passed into the possession of Lord Lovat. Local tradition has it that Mary, Queen of Scots once visited Beauly and had exclaimed: \\"√á'est un beau lieu\\", whereby came the name Beauly. Queen Mary, in 1563, hunted and took her summer journeys in the west and south-west of Scotland; but her brother James, the new Earl of Moray, came north to Inverness late in the autumn, with his two brothers, to hold courts and consolidate his power, and there first put into execution the new Act against witchcraft, sorcery, and necromancy, by burning two old women as witches. It was probably in 1564 that Queen Mary paid that visit to Beauly Priory, the memory of which is preserved in local tradition. She left Edinburgh on 22nd and Perth on 31 July, and proceeded to Athole to the hunting; she then passed the Mounth into Badenoch, and thence to Inverness, and from Inverness to the Chanonry of Ross. Mr Chalmers suggests, with considerable probability, that her object was to inquire into the nature and value of the earldom of Ross, which she meant to settle upon Darnley, whom she had determined to marry, and she would naturally go to Dingwall, which was the head of the earldom, the castle of Dingwall being its manor-place. Going to Dingwall from Inverness, she must have passed by Beauly; and it was therefore, probably, on a bright morning in August 1564 that she opened the window at the prior‚Äôs house, and looking out on the gardens, eulogised the beauty of the spot and the appropriateness of its name. Beauly is also the site of Lovat Castle, which once belonged to the Bissets, but was presented by James VI, to Hugh Fraser, 5th Lord Lovat and later demolished. The population of Beauly was 855 in 1901. =Recent history= In 1994 Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat sold Beaufort castle to Ann Gloag (director of the Stagecoach Group) to pay off debts. In 2002, the Beauly railway station, built in 1862 and closed in 1960, was renovated and reopened. In January 2010, the Scottish government approved controversial plans for a power line upgrade that will begin in Beauly and end in Denny, Falkirk.Power line upgrade given go-ahead, a 6 January 2010 article from BBC News The new power line, part of a plan to carry electricity generated by wind farms on the Western Isles, was called \\"the most significant grid infrastructure project in a generation\\" by Jim Mather MSP. The line will consist of a network of 600 pylons, ranging in height from . The first part of the transmission circuit (Beauly to Fort Augustus) was switched on in July 2013. The population of Beauly was 1,126 in 1991, 1,283 in 2001 and 1,365 in 2011 Governance Beauly is in the Aird and Loch Ness Ward of the Highland Council. Attractions Beauly Priory. =Beaufort Castle= south of Beauly is Beaufort Castle, the chief seat of the Lovats, a modern mansion in the Scottish baronial style. It occupies the site of a fortress erected in the time of Alexander II, which was besieged in 1303 by Edward I. This was replaced by several castles in succession. One of these, Castle Dounie, was attacked and burned by the forces of Oliver Cromwell in 1650 and razed again by the royal army of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland in 1746 during the Jacobite Rising. Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat witnessed this latter conflagration of his castle from a neighbouring hill (he then fled and took refuge in the Highlands before his capture on Loch Morar). =Beauly Priory= The extensive ruins of the abbey church of Beauly Priory with funerary monuments (notably including those of the Mackenzie family) are managed by Historic Scotland. =Churches= St Mary's RC Church, Beauly.The large red sandstone church on the north boundary of the village was designed by the Victorian architect Joseph Aloysius Hansom and funded by Thomas, 12th Lord Fraser of Lovat. The Nave, Chancel, north Aisle and adjoining house were built as a unit. It opened for worship on Sunday 13 November 1864. It was named St Mary's and was the first proper Catholic chapel built in Beauly. To the south-east of Beauly is the Church of Kirkhill, Highland containing the vault of the Lovats as well as a number of septs of the Mackenzies, including Seaforth and Mackenzies of Gairloch. Sport The town is known for the Beauly Shinty Club, its shinty team, who have won the Camanachd Cup three times and have been World Champions once.

Founded in 1888, the Rideau Curling Club maintains a rivalry with the Ottawa Curling Club. History The original club began operation in November, 1888 as the Rideau Skating and Curling Club. The first facility of the club was the Rideau Skating Rink located on Waller Street, which opened in February 1889. The club's original president was Sir Sandford Fleming, and Governor General Lord Stanley as patron. Fleming, who had been a member of the Ottawa Curling Club started the club because the Ottawa would not serve alcoholic beverages after matches. The club was moved from their Waller St. home in 1916, when their land was requisitioned for war purposes. Their second home (1916‚Äì1930) was approximately the present site of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Model history Introduced in 1941 as the successor to the ES-100, the ES-125 was an entry-level archtop electric guitar. It had one P-90 single-coil pickup in the neck position, a single volume control and a single tone control. The pre-war model, discontinued in 1942, had a smaller 14.5\\" body. When reintroduced in 1946 it had the larger 16.25\\" wide body that the ES-150 had. The unbound rosewood fingerboard initially sported pearl trapezoid inlays; later, it would have dot inlays. In the mid-1950s, the ES-125T was introduced, which was an entry-level thinline archtop electric guitar based on the original ES-125. It would later add options for double P-90 pickups and a sharp cutaway, referred to as a florentine cutaway, similar to the ES-175. Both the thinline and the regular models would be discontinued by the 1970s.

The original had 6 Alnico slug pole pieces. In 1950 the P90 transitioned to 6 adjustable poles between two Alnico 5 bar magnets. The model used for the ES-125 has a string spacing on the neck pickup of 1\\" from high E to low E. The ES-125 also used a tapered dogear cover for their neck position pickups with a thickness of 4/16\\" on the treble side and 5/16\\" on the bass side. Since the fingerboard sits flush to the body (as opposed to an ES-175) the ES-125 requires a shorter neck pickup than a typical dogear. This pickup is, however, not as short as those found on an ES-330TD which has the pickup mounted flush to the end of the fingerboard. Coils were wound to approximately 10,000 wraps although DC resistance of these pickups can vary greatly Volume and tone controls were 500k Audio taper pots. A treble bypass cap value of .022 microfarads was used for the tone circuit.

It is the administrative headquarters of Baglung District and Dhaulagiri Zone. Baglung serves as the major center for business, finance, education, service and healthcare for the people of mid-Kali Gandaki valley that encompass Beni, Jaljala, Baglung, Kushma, Kathekhola, Galkot, Phalewas and Jaimuni local bodies. The city is located at the cross-section of Kaligandaki corridor highway and midhill highway that transverse Nepal in north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest directions respectively. Geography and climate Baglung Bazar is situated on a plateau overlooking the Kali Gandaki gorge directly south of the Dhaulagiri Himalayan range. Steep cliffs rising from the valley flank the plateau on three sides. City limits are roughly determined by the Theule Khola to the south, Kali Gandaki river to the east and Dhodeni Khola to the north. Baglung enjoys warm summers and mild winters. Annual average temperatures range from a maximum of and a minimum of . Highs above and lows below are rare. The average annual rainfall recorded is in 1982.Aryal, D., R. Rehgmi and N. Rimai (Eds.) 1982. Nepal District Profile:Nepal Research As√≠ooc/a/e√≠. Kathmandu, Nepal. Rainfall is heavily affected by the monsoon and most of it occurs during the months of June through September. Rest of the year is mostly dry and sunny. Snowfall is extremely rare in the city core, however, higher elevations within the city limits see occasional snow during the winter months. Due to large topographic variation climate ranging from hot subtropical to temperate montane climate can be experienced within the city limits. history  Pilgrims from India and rest of Nepal traveling to Muktinath and traders seeking to barter grains from the south with salt from Tibet frequented a trade route along the banks of Kaligandaki river since ancient times. However, owing to its location high above the banks of Kaligandaki river and the trade route few actually ventured into the area that is Baglung Bazar today. The area also lacked reliable source of water for drinking and irrigation making it poorly suited for settlement. A lack of evidence of structures and settlements predating 16th century in the area and a lack of mention in historical records predating 16th century support this notion. First confirmed history of settlement in Baglung is found during the reign of King Pratapi Narayan of Parbat (later Galkot) Kingdom in the early 16th century. In year 1534 AD King Pratapi Narayan of Parbat married daughter of king Manimukunda Sen of Palpa. As the wedding procession reached Baglung, following a dream, the king decided to establish goddess Kalika brought from Palpa at the site. Holder of the goddesses sword Chakra Panwar was given the title of Khadka and asked to stay back as caretaker of the goddess. He was also bestowed with the land that forms Baglung Bazar today. The Magar carriers of the idol were settled in Lung Gau area of Baglung. A temple was built and an annual fair was started during the Chaitre Dashain festival. Descendants of Chakra Panwar Khadka built irrigation channels, pastures, watering holes, fruit gardens and established first establishments in Baglung. Baglung also emerged as an outpost for revenue collection and taxation as the Khadka family also served as local revenue collection officers and militia commanders. Three hundred years later, following annexation of the Parbat kingdom by Gorkha, Newar traders from Bhaktapur arrived in Baglung and established permanent trading houses and market. During this era Baglung was also proclaimed as a \\"choti gauda\\" or district headquarters and official judicial, military, mint and taxation offices were established. Baglung continued to act as administrative headquarters during the Rana regime. After establishment of the current district and zonal system Baglung retained its status as headquarters serving the area. Transportation Completion of several road projects have put Baglung at the crossroads of major north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest highway systems of Nepal. Tracks have been opened for Kaligandaki corridor highway connecting Tibet to the north via Mustang and border towns in the south. Similarly, midhill highway that connects eastern and western halves of Nepal passes through the city. Hari Bahadur Khadka memorial road connects Baglung with Kushmi Sera in the south and also provides access to Balewa airport. Baglung is connected to Beni Bazar of Myagdi to the north and Kusma Bazar of Parbat which are located to the north and to the south-east, respectively. Pokhara Baglung highway connects the town with Pokhara, to the east. Another important road network connecting Gulmi district in the south originates in Baglung Bazar and passes via Sigana, Gaja and Bareng. Recently under initiative of late member of parliament Hari Bahadur Khadka a road network connecting Baglung Bazar with Bihu that passes through settlements higher in the northern flanks of Kathe Khola valley has been completed. In addition to major highways several narrow seasonal dirt roads connect the town with adjoining rural areas. Suspension bridges meant for foot traffic are abundant in the area. So much so that the moniker \\"land of suspension bridges\\" is used to identify Baglung. Important crossings over Kaligandaki river are located at Pharse, Nirahe, Nayapul and Kaiya. The bridge over Kaligandaki connecting Kaiya with Kushma is notable for having the highest and longest span in Nepal. A mechanical cable-car spans the Kaligandaki river connecting Narayansthan with Kushma. Many other suspension bridges can be found spanning numerous rivers and rivulets within the city limit. Baglung airport (code: BGL), in Balewa, is located 12 km to the south of the town across the valley from Kusma. With the completion of the Pokhara-Baglung highway this airport has fallen into disuse. Water transportation is virtually absent. However, the adjoining Kali Gandaki river offers some of the best white-water rafting in Nepal and attracts a decent number of thrill seekers every year. Mt. Dhaulagiri seen from Baglung Demographics There are 57,823 inhabitants in Baglung municipality as per the report of the state restructuring committee (2017).http://mofald.gov.np/sites/default/files/News_Notices/Final%20District%201-75%20Corrected%20Last%20for%20RAJPATRA.pdf Annual population growth rate is 3.03% (Census 2011).

Several private hospitals have come into operation in recent years providing additional healthcare services. Baglung is a Banking and financial hub of the Kaligandaki valley region. Almost all major national banks have branches and regional offices in the city. Financial services are also provided by many co-operatives and finance companies that operate out of the city. Remittance plays a major role in economy of the area. A large number of people are employed overseas and in neighboring India. People from Baglung and nearby also have a tradition of enlisting in the British and the Indian Army. Baglung and the region receive one of the highest amounts of remittance earned from foreign employment in Nepal. As of 2010, pension fund alone distributed to ex-servicemen of the Indian Army by the Pension Paying Office at Baglung stands at around US$20 million.http://www.nagariknews.com/society/nation/13251-2010-05-11-11-45-12.html Transportation sector is another major source of employment in Baglung. Many small and medium scale transportation companies provide bus, jeep and freight services to adjoining rural communities and to the major cities in the nation. There are many shops and restaurants catering to the locals and visitors. The town is bustling with many grocery stores, newsstands, repair shops, tailors, beauty parlors, clothing and electronics outlets. There are few small scale industries. Most of the manufacturing work is limited to production of construction materials and home furnishings. Schools and institutions of higher education also employ a significant number of people. Places of interest Baglung kalika temple Views of Himalayas can be had from Baglung. Bhakunde and Panchakot are sites for views of the Dhaulagiri and Annapurna ranges. Terraced fields, waterfalls, forests, deep gorges and caves are abundant throughout the area. The terrain is suitable for trekking, biking, and rafting make Baglung a location for thrill seekers. Baglung also served as a starting point for trekkers to Mustang, Dolpa and Mt. Dhaulagiri in the past. However, with expansion of road networks Baglung now mostly serves as a staging point for travelers to these areas. Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, the only hunting reserve in Nepal and a habitat for blue sheep and snow leopard, also falls within district boundaries. Recent surge in interest in the hunting reserve, Putha himalaya range, round Dhaulagiri trekking and \\"Guerrilla trek\\" have once again placed Baglung on tourist maps. Several tall suspension bridges can be found in the area. One of them, the highest in Nepal, connects Balewa within southern boundaries of the city with Kushma over the Kaligandaki river. A second shorter bridge spans Kathekhola river and connects Tityang with the city core. Several temples in and around Baglung are pilgrimage sites. Most famous of all religious sites in Baglung, is the Kaliaka Bhagawati Temple, which is visited by thousands of pilgrims each year. An annual fair, one of the largest in Nepal, is held during the Chaitre Dashain festival.

This joint project between Florida State University (FSU) and the University of the West Indies (UWI) has its offices in Tallahassee and at the Caribbean Law Institute Centre (CLIC) in Barbados, which was created in 1994 as a unit of research in the Faculty of Law at UWI. The Centre works in parallel with the CLI office at FSU. Early in its history, CLI identified certain law reform priorities. One of CLI's first tasks was to develop and administer the Commercial Law Survey, which defined the state of commercial law in the Region and provided background information to guide the selection of other projects. CLI's projects have included Company Law, Shipping Law, Treaties, Environmental Law Survey, Insurance Law, Consumer Law, Banking Law, Bankruptcy, Insolvency, and Alternative Dispute Resolution. CLI meets its objectives by organizing experts in the legal and business communities to provide objective research and analysis of law-related constraints to economic development. CLI drafts legislation and regulations affecting the modernization and harmonization of laws in the Caribbean, especially in the area of commercial law, and informs and educates the business community, the Bar, government leaders and consumers about CLI's law reform programs. CLI cooperates in its activities with CARICOM, OECS, regional governments and a number of professional associations in law, accounting, industry and commerce. To meet its goals, the Institute engages in projects that command the interest of those who have a stake in the modernization and harmonization of laws. As CLI seeks ways to involve the legal, governmental and commercial sectors in its activities, these constituencies become effective advocates for the draft legislation CLI produces. CLI has also organized meetings of the CLI Fellows to discuss CLI drafts. The Fellows include the attorneys general of the Caribbean nations served by CLI, and members of the private Bar and of the commercial sector.

For the set of differences of pairs of elements, see Minkowski difference. In combinatorics, a (v,k,\\\\lambda) difference set is a subset D of size k of a group G of order v such that every nonidentity element of G can be expressed as a product d_1d_2^{-1} of elements of D in exactly \\\\lambda ways. A difference set D is said to be cyclic, abelian, non-abelian, etc., if the group G has the corresponding property. A difference set with \\\\lambda = 1 is sometimes called planar or simple. If G is an abelian group written in additive notation, the defining condition is that every nonzero element of G can be written as a difference of elements of D in exactly \\\\lambda ways. The term \\"difference set\\" arises in this way. Basic facts * A simple counting argument shows that there are exactly k^2-k pairs of elements from D that will yield nonidentity elements, so every difference set must satisfy the equation k^2-k=(v-1)\\\\lambda. * If D is a difference set, and g\\\\in G, then gD=\\\\\\\\{gd:d\\\\in D\\\\\\\\} is also a difference set, and is called a translate of D (D + g in additive notation). * The complement of a (v,k,\\\\lambda)-difference set is a (v,v-k,v-2k+\\\\lambda)-difference set. * The set of all translates of a difference set D forms a symmetric block design, called the development of D and denoted by dev(D). In such a design there are v elements (usually called points) and v blocks (subsets). Each block of the design consists of k points, each point is contained in k blocks. Any two blocks have exactly \\\\lambda elements in common and any two points are simultaneously contained in exactly \\\\lambda blocks. The group G acts as an automorphism group of the design. It is sharply transitive on both points and blocks.. The theorem only states point transitivity, but block transitivity follows from this by the second corollary on p. 330. ** In particular, if \\\\lambda=1, then the difference set gives rise to a projective plane. An example of a (7,3,1) difference set in the group \\\\mathbb{Z}/7\\\\mathbb{Z} is the subset \\\\\\\\{1,2,4\\\\\\\\}. The translates of this difference set form the Fano plane. * Since every difference set gives a symmetric design, the parameter set must satisfy the Bruck‚ÄìRyser‚ÄìChowla theorem. * Not every symmetric design gives a difference set. Equivalent and isomorphic difference sets Two difference sets D_1 in group G_1 and D_2 in group G_2 are equivalent if there is a group isomorphism \\\\psi between G_1 and G_2 such that D_1^{\\\\psi} = \\\\\\\\{d^{\\\\psi}\\\\colon d \\\\in D_1 \\\\\\\\} = g D_2 for some g \\\\in G_2. The two difference sets are isomorphic if the designs dev(D_1) and dev(D_2) are isomorphic as block designs. Equivalent difference sets are isomorphic, but there exist examples of isomorphic difference sets which are not equivalent. In the cyclic difference set case, all known isomorphic difference sets are equivalent. Multipliers A multiplier of a difference set D in group G is a group automorphism \\\\phi of G such that D^{\\\\phi} = gD for some g \\\\in G. If G is abelian and \\\\phi is the automorphism that maps h \\\\mapsto h^t, then t is called a numerical or Hall multiplier. It has been conjectured that if p is a prime dividing k-\\\\lambda and not dividing v, then the group automorphism defined by g\\\\mapsto g^p fixes some translate of D (this is equivalent to being a multiplier). It is known to be true for p>\\\\lambda when G is an abelian group, and this is known as the First Multiplier Theorem. A more general known result, the Second Multiplier Theorem, says that if D is a (v,k,\\\\lambda)-difference set in an abelian group G of exponent v^* (the least common multiple of the orders of every element), let t be an integer coprime to v. If there exists a divisor m>\\\\lambda of k-\\\\lambda such that for every prime p dividing m, there exists an integer i with t\\\\equiv p^i\\\\ \\\\pmod{v^*}, then t is a numerical divisor. For example, 2 is a multiplier of the (7,3,1)-difference set mentioned above. It has been mentioned that a numerical multiplier of a difference set D in an abelian group G fixes a translate of D, but it can also be shown that there is a translate of D which is fixed by all numerical multipliers of D. Parameters The known difference sets or their complements have one of the following parameter sets: *((q^{n+2}-1)/(q-1), (q^{n+1}-1)/(q-1), (q^n-1)/(q-1))-difference set for some prime power q and some positive integer n. These are known as the classical parameters and there are many constructions of difference sets having these parameters. *(4n-1,2n-1,n-1)-difference set for some positive integer n. Difference sets with v = 4n - 1 are called Paley-type difference sets. *(4n^2,2n^2-n,n^2-n)-difference set for some positive integer n. A difference set with these parameters is a Hadamard difference set. *(q^{n+1}(1+(q^{n+1}-1)/(q-1)),q^n(q^{n+1}-1)/(q-1),q^n(q^n-1)/(q-1))-difference set for some prime power q and some positive integer n. Known as the McFarland parameters. *(3^{n+1}(3^{n+1}-1)/2,3^n(3^{n+1}+1)/2,3^n(3^n+1)/2)-difference set for some positive integer n. Known as the Spence parameters. *(4q^{2n}(q^{2n}-1)/(q-1),q^{2n-1}(1+2(q^{2n}-1)/(q+1)),q^{2n-1}(q^{2n-1}+1)(q-1)/(q+1))-difference set for some prime power q and some positive integer n. Difference sets with these parameters are called Davis-Jedwab-Chen difference sets. Known difference sets In many constructions of difference sets the groups that are used are related to the additive and multiplicative groups of finite fields. The notation used to denote these fields differs according to discipline. In this section, {\\\\rm GF}(q) is the Galois field of order q, where q is a prime or prime power. The group under addition is denoted by G = ({\\\\rm GF}(q), +), while {\\\\rm GF}(q)^* is the multiplicative group of non-zero elements. * Paley (4n-1, 2n-1, n-1)-difference set: ::Let q = 4n -1 be a prime power. In the group G = ({\\\\rm GF}(q), +), let D be the set of all non-zero squares. * Singer ((q^{n+2}-1)/(q-1), (q^{n+1}-1)/(q-1), (q^n-1)/(q-1))-difference set: ::Let G={\\\\rm GF}(q^{n+2})^*/{\\\\rm GF}(q)^*. Then the set D=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in G~~{\\\\rm Tr}_{q^{n+2}/q}(x)=0\\\\\\\\} is a ((q^{n+2}-1)/(q-1), (q^{n+1}-1)/(q-1), (q^n-1)/(q-1))-difference set, where {\\\\rm Tr}_{q^{n+2}/q}:{\\\\rm GF}(q^{n+2})\\\\rightarrow{\\\\rm GF}(q) is the trace function {\\\\rm Tr}_{q^{n+2}/q}(x)=x+x^q+\\\\cdots+x^{q^{n+1}}. * Twin prime power \\\\left ( q^2 + 2q, \\\\frac{q^2 + 2q -1}{2}, \\\\frac{q^2+2q-3}{4} \\\\right )-difference set when q and q+2 are both prime powers: ::In the group G = ({\\\\rm GF}(q), +) \\\\oplus ({\\\\rm GF}(q+2), +), let D = \\\\\\\\{(x,y) \\\\colon y = 0 \\\\text{ or } x \\\\text{ and } y \\\\text{ are non-zero and both are squares or both are non-squares} \\\\\\\\}. History The systematic use of cyclic difference sets and methods for the construction of symmetric block designs dates back to R. C. Bose and a seminal paper of his in 1939. However, various examples appeared earlier than this, such as the \\"Paley Difference Sets\\" which date back to 1933. The generalization of the cyclic difference set concept to more general groups is due to R.H. Bruck in 1955. Multipliers were introduced by Marshall Hall Jr. in 1947. Application It is found by Xia, Zhou and Giannakis that difference sets can be used to construct a complex vector codebook that achieves the difficult Welch bound on maximum cross correlation amplitude. The so- constructed codebook also forms the so-called Grassmannian manifold. Generalisations A (v,k,\\\\lambda,s) difference family is a set of subsets B=\\\\\\\\{B_1,...B_s\\\\\\\\} of a group G such that the order of G is v, the size of B_i is k for all i, and every nonidentity element of G can be expressed as a product d_1d_2^{-1} of elements of B_i for some i (i.e. both d_1,d_2 come from the same B_i) in exactly \\\\lambda ways. A difference set is a difference family with s=1. The parameter equation above generalises to s(k^2-k)=(v-1)\\\\lambda. The development dev (B) = \\\\\\\\{B_i+g: i=1,...,s, g \\\\in G\\\\\\\\} of a difference family is a 2-design. Every 2-design with a regular automorphism group is dev (B) for some difference family B.

The last floating logs came out in the 1990s as the last mill on the lake shore, Modoc Lumber Company, closed its doors. The former Modoc mill site is now being developed as Timbermill Shores.Timbermill Shores Some logs were removed from the lake bottom in the late 1990s but many remain still on the bottom, remnants of a near century of log pond use. A few logs rise to the surface in spring every year causing hazard to boat traffic.

Unlike most of the other islands of the Marshall Islands, Mejit is a stony island rather than a coral atoll, although it is surrounded by a fringing coral reef enclosing a narrow lagoon. It is located east of the main line of the Ratak chain, approximately northeast from Wotje. With an estimated population of 348 people, the island is lush in pandanus, breadfruit and taro. To the residents, this island is known as 'Paradise\\". It has a beautiful fresh water lake (rare in the Marshall Islands) with indigenous ducks. Mejit is famous for its pandanus leaf mats. An airstrip, Mejit Airport, bisects the island. It is served by Air Marshall Islands. History First recorded sighting by Europeans was by the Spanish expedition of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi on 9 January 1565. It was charted as Los Barbudos (The Bearded in Spanish) because of the long beards of its inhabitants.

In 1884 Mejit was claimed by the Empire of Germany along with the rest of the Marshall Islands, and the Germans established a trading outpost. After World War I, the island came under the South Seas Mandate of the Empire of Japan. Following the end of World War II, it came under the control of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986.

The phrase has been used in the Hebrew Bible by Jews (cf. ), and by Christians, since the time of the early Church as a benediction, as well as a means of bidding a person Godspeed. Many clergy, when blessing their congregants individually or as a group, use the phrase \\"God bless you\\". Origins and legends National Geographic reports that during the plague of CE 590, \\"Pope Gregory I ordered unceasing prayer for divine intercession. Part of his command was that anyone sneezing be blessed immediately (\\"God bless you\\"), since sneezing was often the first sign that someone was falling ill with the plague.\\" By CE 750, it became customary to say \\"God bless you\\" as a response to one sneezing. The practice of blessing someone who sneezes dates as far back as at least CE 77 in the West, although it is far older than most specific explanations can account for, with non-theistic well-wishing going as far back as 500 BCE on the Indian subcontinent. Some have offered an explanation suggesting that people once held the folk belief that a person's soul could be thrown from their body when they sneezed,Snopes Urban Legends - Bless You! that sneezing otherwise opened the body to invasion by the Devil or evil spirits,Ed Zotti, Editor. Why Do We Say \\"God Bless You\\" After a Sneeze?, Straight Dope, 27 September 2001. or that sneezing was the body's effort to force out an invading evil presence. In these cases, \\"God bless you\\" or \\"bless you\\" is used as a sort of shield against evil. The Irish Folk story \\"Master and Man\\" by Thomas Crofton Croker, collected by William Butler Yeats, describes this variation.Gutenberg.org, Project Gutenberg story by T. Crofton Croker, 1898. Moreover, in the past some people may have thought that the heart stops beating during a sneeze, and that the phrase \\"God bless you\\" encourages the heart to continue beating.Madsci.org, Mad Scientist posting by Tom Wilson, M.D./PhD, Pathology, Div. of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine In some cultures, sneezing is seen as a sign of good fortune or God's beneficence.Re: Why does plucking my eyebrows make me sneeze?, MadSci Network posting by Robert West, Post-doc/Fellow, 1997-08-05 As such, alternative responses to sneezing are the French phrase √† vos souhaits (meaning \\"to your wishes\\"), the German word Gesundheit (meaning \\"health\\") sometimes adopted by English speakers, the Irish word sl√°inte (meaning \\"good health\\"), the Italian salute (also meaning \\"health\\"), the Spanish salud (also meaning \\"health\\"), the Hebrew laBri'ut (colloquial) or liVriut (classic) (both spelled: \\"◊ú◊ë◊®◊ô◊ê◊ï◊™\\") (meaning \\"to health\\"), the Arabic saha (spelled \\"ÿµÿ≠ÿ©\\", also meaning \\"health\\"), the Russian bud' zdorov (spelled: \\"–±—É–¥—å –∑–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤\\", meaning \\"be healthy\\"). In Islam the prophet Muhammad instructed Muslims who sneezes to say \\"ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ŸÑŸÑŸá\\" meaning ‚ÄúThanks to Allah‚Äù, and whoever hears them say that should reply \\"Ÿäÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖŸÉŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá\\" meaning ‚Äúmay Allah have mercy on you‚Äú, and the person who sneezed should reply \\"ŸäŸáÿØŸäŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ŸàŸäÿµŸÑÿ≠ ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÉ\\" meaning ‚ÄúMay Allah Guide you to the right path and calm your mind‚Äù, and for repeated sneezes, they keep replying the same reply for a maximum of three times, by then the reply is changed to \\"ÿπÿßŸÅÿßŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá\\" meaning ‚ÄúMay Allah heal you‚Äú and the replies stop. This act in Islam is called \\"ÿ™ÿ¥ŸÖŸäÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿπÿßÿ∑ÿ≥\\". In Persian culture, the response to sneezing is \\"Afiat Basheh\\". More often in the old days and out of superstitious nature, sneezing sometimes has been called \\"sabr =ÿµÿ®ÿ±,\\" meaning \\"to wait or be patient.\\" And when trying to do something or go somewhere and suddenly sneezing, one should stop or sit for a few minutes and then restart. By this act the \\"bad thing\\" passes and one will be saved. Meanwhile, an undated story from the Buddha's lifetime (~500 BCE), recorded in the Buddhist Vinaya, concerning customs around sneezing is as follows: \\"Once while giving a talk he sneezed and everyone in the audience called out \`Live long!' (Ciram jiva!). This made so much noise that the talk was interrupted. The Buddha then asked the audience: \`When 'Live long!' is said after someone sneezes, do they live long or not because of that?' The monks admitted that this was not so. The Buddha agreed and said that therefore, it is not necessary to say \`Live long!' each time someone sneezes (Vin.II,140)\\" References * Opie, Iona, and Moira Tatem. A Dictionary of Superstitions.

As the city expanded, peripheral neighborhoods like Butchertown, Phoenix Hill, Russell, Shelby Park, Smoketown and others were developed to house and employ the growing population. The arrival of the streetcar allowed suburbs to be built further out, such as Beechmont, Belknap, Old Louisville, Shawnee and the Highlands.

Although the genealogy of early Ponthieu and Boulogne is scanty (and the 12th century versions unreliable, because of their efforts to tie the ruling houses of Boulogne and Ponthieu into earlier noble houses), it is most likely that Guy, the Bishop of Amiens, was the uncle (and not the brother) of Enguerrand II and his brother Guy I of Ponthieu. Count Enguerrand II's and Guy I's father Hugh II was the son of Enguerrand I by an earlier marriage: Enguerrand I evidently married a Boulognnais countess, the wife of Arnold II, who died in battle: from this later marriage came Guy and his brother Fulk (later abbot of Forest l'Abbaye), and probably a Robert. Career Bishop Guy was educated for a career in the church at the abbey of St Riquier and was one of its most brilliant students. His teacher was abbot Enguerrand (called \\"the wise\\" d. 9 December 1045). Guy may have been an archdeacon by 1045, and was bishop by 1058. \\"His predecessor to the episcopate of Amiens, Fulk II, was caught up in the emerging struggle between the secular clergy, dominated by the political contentions of the great feudal families, and the reforming popes, with their bias in favour of monastic houses, which they often rendered exempt from episcopal jurisdiction.\\" When Guy became bishop of Amiens he inherited the legal struggles of his predecessor; this eventually resulted in Guy being suspended from his duties as bishop, although he continued to rule the see as lord. He was in this state of papal disfavour at the time of the Norman Conquest. This may have been the (contributing) reason why bishop Guy composed the Carmen de Hastingae Proelio (Song of the Battle of Hastings), as an effort to flatter the new Norman king of England, William I, who was then in very high favor with the pope. But if so, bishop Guy's poem failed in its purpose. He was highly enough thought of at the Norman court to be assigned as Matilda of Flanders's chaplain when she went over to England for her coronation in 1068. But when bishop Guy died in 1075, he still had not regained his bishopric.

It is available as a transparent liquid with a characteristic strong aroma, and as white bi-concave scored tablets. While not available for sale in the Western countries, Corvalol is sometimes brought over from Eastern Europe for self-administration to other countries of residence. Corvalol contains documented amounts of psychoactive chemicals, and may interact with other prescription medications that a person is taking.Wikipedia.ru. \\"–ö–æ—Ä–≤–∞–ª–æ–ª\\". Corvalol was developed in the USSR in 1960 as an analogue of the German drug - Valocordin, therefore it is copied in composition and action.

Currently there is no evidence to support the use of phenobarbital in cardiovascular or bronchospastic disease states.  Safety  Due to lack of scientific evidence supported by randomized clinical trials in humans, Corvalol and its components should be used with caution in patients with serious cardiovascular conditions, such as hypertension, angina, or respiratory conditions such as asthma. Prescription medications that have been scientifically proved to be effective in these disease states should be preferred due to evidence supporting their clinical use. According to the American Geriatrics Society, phenobarbital should not be used in the elderly population due to high rate of physical dependence, tolerance to sleep benefits, and the risk of overdose at low dosages.American Geriatrics Society updated Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults. The American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel. According to the manufacturer, overdose is possible due to accumulation of the ingredients when Corvalol is used frequently and in large doses. Symptoms of overdose include central nervous system depression, confusion, dizziness, ataxia, and somnolence. In serious cases overdose may result in breathing depression, tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension (low blood pressure), cardiovascular collapse, and coma.  Drug interactions  Phenobarbital is a strong inducer (activator) of several hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and others. One of the functions of these enzymes is to change the molecular structure of medications and other substances taken in by the human body. Taking phenobarbital- containing products, such as Corvalol, while taking other medications may reduce their effectiveness. Some of the medications that may have decreased effectiveness when used with Corvalol are apixaban, rivaroxaban, clozapine, itraconazole, nifedipine, biologics, and many others. Corvalol may increase CNS depressant effect of other sedatives and hypnotics.  Pharmaceutical category  Corvalol valerianate component of the preparation is purported to offer mild spasmolytic effects on the vasculature. Phenobarbital is a central nervous system depressant.  Composition  Ethyl ester of Œ±-bromoisovaleric acid According to the Farmak product label of Colvalol oral solution, the composition per 1 mL (26 drops) is as follows: * Ethyl ester of Œ±-bromoisovaleric acid (ethyl 2-bromo-3-methylbutyrate) ‚Äî 20 mg * Phenobarbital ‚Äî 18.26 mg * Peppermint oil ‚Äî 1.42 mg Inactive ingredients: stabilizer, ethanol 96%, purified water.

Legal status  Phenobarbital, one of the principal ingredients in Corvalol, is a DEA Schedule IV substance in the United States. Schedule IV substances have a low potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedules I‚ÄìIII. Examples of Schedule IV substances are alprazolam (Xanax), carisoprodol (Soma), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium) and others.U/S/ Department of Justice. Drug Enforcement Administration.

It is widely used to treat elevated blood pressure and as a general-purpose tranquilizer/sedative. Despite the -lol suffix, the drug is not a beta-blocker. Corvalol is so common in Eastern Europe that, in 1996, the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation included it in the list of mandatory items in all Russian passenger vehicle first aid kits, alongside such drugs as aspirin, metamizole sodium (branded Analgin), nitroglycerin, and activated charcoal.

Given normal inflammatory circumstances, microbial pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) bind with the endocytic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of phagocytes, which mediates neutrophil mediation or macrophage phagocytosis. As well as endocytic PRRs, phagocytes furthermore express opsonin receptors such as Fc receptor and complement receptor 1 (CR1). Should the microbe be coated with opsonising antibodies or C3b complement, the co-stimulation of endocytic PRR and opsonin receptor increases the efficacy of the phagocytic process, enhancing the lysosomal elimination of the infective agent. This mechanism of antibody-mediated increase in phagocytic efficacy is named opsonization. Opsonization involves the binding of an opsonin (e.g., antibody) to an epitope on a pathogen.Definition: opsonization from Online Medical Dictionary After opsonin binds to the membrane, phagocytes are attracted to the pathogen. The Fab portion of the antibody binds to the antigen, whereas the Fc portion of the antibody binds to an Fc receptor on the phagocyte, facilitating phagocytosis.Parham, P. (2005). The Immune System,\\" Garland Science Publishing, New York, NY. The core receptor + opsonin complex also creates byproducts like C3b and C4b which are important components for the efficient function of the complement system. These components are deposited on the cell surface of the pathogen and aid in its destruction.Kumar, V., Abbas, A. K., & Fausto, N. (2005). Pathologic basis of disease. Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunders In antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity the pathogen does not need to be phagocytozed to be destroyed. During this process, the pathogen is opsonized and bound with the antibody IgG via its Fab domain. This allows the antibody binding of an immune effector cell via its Fc domain. Antibody- dependent cell-mediated inherent mediation then triggers a release of lysis products from the bound immune effector cell (monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and NK cells). Lack of mediation can cause inflammation of surrounding tissues and damage to healthy cells.

The musical is remembered in part for introducing the standard \\"Lazy Afternoon,\\" sung by Ballard, and its fantastical, suggestive settings by William and Jean Eckart. The musical was presented Off-Broadway in 1961 at the Equity Library Theatre, and in 1962 it was produced at the York Playhouse. Both productions were directed by Robert Ennis Turoff and starred Roberta MacDonald as Helen and Stan Page as Ulysses.\\"'The Golden Apple' 1962\\" lortel.org The musical continues to receive occasional productions.

Preliminary moves An initial French offensive into Piedmont had been beaten off after three days of fighting in the Varaita valley, near the village of Casteldelfino (7‚Äì10 October 1743). In July 1744, a French army under Prince Cont√¨ tried to enter Piedmont from the western Alps. The first columns of the French army took the head of the Stura and Maira valleys, while three other columns, the 7th, 8th and 9th, were positioned at the head of the Varaita valley. The 7th column was composed of six battalions under Lieutenant General Don Louis Gandinga. It left Guillestre and came through San Paul and Maurin, taking the head of Col d'Agnello to threaten the valley of Ch√¢teaudauphin (Casteldelfino). It then withdrew to gain Acceglio in the Maira valley in support of the 6th column under Lieutenant General Compte de Lautrec, who had orders to gain Preit village to threaten the Maira. Marquis de Camposanto, a Lieutenant General with five battalions that composed the 8th column, advanced from the camp of Pontcernieres near Brian√ßon, just short of the Varaita and Maira valleys. Baill√¨ de Givri, a Lieutenant General at the head of ten battalions that formed the 9th column, captured the Montgeneve gap and descended into the valley of Cesana to deceive the Sardinian king Charles Emmanuel III. Givri made a feint and took Gardetta at the valley of Bellino and also seized the top of Col du Bondormir that dominates the valley of Chateaudauphin. Brigadier General Fran√ßois de Chevert commanded 1,500 men from several regiments and four companies of grenadiers from Poitou‚Äôs brigade. All these nine columns were at the positions assigned by Cont√¨ after traveling on roads heavily soaked by rain. Prince Conti and Philip of Spain, known as the 'Infant of Spain', going down to the Col de l‚ÄôArgentera at the head of their column, took Bersezio in the Stura valley before the rock of the Barricade. The Savoyard Lieutenant General Pallavicini, informed by his spies that three enemy corps were approaching with an envelopment maneuver, abandoned the high and the low Lobiera and the camp of the Montagnetta, strong positions for any army to take. After his success, Prince Conti was worried about the situations of the columns that were fighting on his left. The Marechal de camp de Villemur sent an officer to give news of the victory on the right, but the messenger drowned. Other couriers were sent at the same time to Ball√¨ de Givr√¨ and Marquis Pallavicini, but they were not able to arrive in time to stop the futile fight in the Varaita Valley. Lieutenant General de Gandica, at the head of the 7th column, took Acceglio in the Maira Valley, then went into the Varaita valley to support the 8th and the 9th columns. Marquis de Camposanto, chief of the 8th column, reached the mountain of Traversiera with five battalions. To arrive there he marched to the foot of Mont Peirol, where he advanced against the entrenched camp at the Bicocca plateau. His purpose was not a general assault. He only wished to create some noise and to avoid the enemy's presence at the main entrenchments of Pierre Longue. Ball√¨ de Grivri made a feint and came with the 9th column from Briancon to the other side of the Montgeneve. He then came back and went to Col d'Agnello. He commanded Compte de Danois, a Lieutenant General, and ten battalions, of whom three were from Poitou's regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Morenne. He also had a vanguard under Chevert, who commanded a detachment of 1,500 men and four companies of grenadiers. Chevert attacked the outpost of Chayol on July 16, but withdrew after exchanging fire with enemy forces near Gardetta. During the night of the 16th and 17th, the French camped at Chayol while Savoyard troops did the same at Gardetta. At around this time, the French were informed about enemy positions by a spy. The battle With Chevert knowing that the enemy had equivalent numbers, he decided to attack. French grenadiers struggled to make inroads into Bondormir and had to assault several staunchly defended buildings in the process. At this time, Danois arrived with Poitou‚Äôs brigade. Chevert ordered an outflanking maneuver to trap the enemy, but the Sardinians retreated in good order under the cover of 300 dragoons. The French army descended to Celle di Bellino after destroying the buildings at Gardetta. They then headed to Bondormir and still had difficulties taking the trenches. From here they climbed over Pierrelongue and joined other detached groups arriving from parallel paths. Chevert now wanted an immediate full-scale attack and a French war council agreed to launch this assault the next day. As soon as the Piedmontese could see the enemy on top of Pierrelongue, they destroyed the communications running from Bondormir and prepared defenses. The enemy was preparing a better zig-zag path through Pierrelongue‚Äôs ravine on the north face to reach the top of the mountain. Chevert had to prepare the attack with 1,500 men and they had to take the Pas du Chat, a deep ravine with slippery terrain. At the end of this gap, there were 400 Piedmontese grenadiers and a battery of cannons. When Chevert moved, the mountain was covered by thick fog, and he was not able to see the trenches. He received a whole volley from some grenadiers who could hear him but they could not recognize his position. Chevert ordered a faster descent, to fix bayonets, and to avoid any exchange of fire with the enemy. The French charged and the enemy withdrew towards the redoubt of the Baraccone in great confusion. The Piedmontese abandoned their tents and burned three great stacks of wood to inform Bicocca's garrison that Pierrelongue was in French hands. The French column descended from Pierrelongue without great loss, despite heavy artillery shelling. It attacked the second redoubt on the Battagliola peak, forcing the Sardinians to flee. The French stopped their advance at Battagliola and held this position for about two hours to attend Mass and to take some rest. They later advanced against the heavily defended Mount Cavallo redoubt. The Sardinian commanders were Verger and Brigadier Chevalier Castagnole. Before the battle Chevert sent his aide-de-camp to Verger, a major of the Regiment de Provence, to intimate the surrender or run the risk of having the entire garrison executed. Verger declined the call for surrender. Chevert ordered an immediate attack, but he wanted to inform de Givr√¨ so the latter would come to his aid. Chevert told de Givri to do nothing without first being given orders. Poor supply conditions convinced Chevert that a massive attack was required to rescue the situation. Chevert‚Äôs troops were to attack the battery while Poitou‚Äôs brigade would advance on his right. In the center there was the regiment of Provence. Colonel Salis had to take a plateau over the Bellino ravine to avoid the presence of four Sardinian battalions south of the mountain. The column advanced without sacks to be more efficient in combat, but it could not advance in good order on such mountainous terrain; some soldiers went over to the others and the three corps attacked in only one great column. The weather was very dark on that day and a great, thick fog covered the redoubt; the French arrived within 50 meters of enemy positions undetected. A fierce exchange of fire opened the fight. The French were on open ground and took a heavy pounding. They had been fighting for more than four hours at a range of only 10 paces from the Sardinian positions and eventually had to withdraw. De Givr√¨ wanted to continue the fight and sent in a fresh line of battalions. The attack was renewed with such courage and bravery that the French again reached the palisades, but they were ejected with great loss. De Givr√¨, badly wounded in the thigh during this second assault, ordered his men to withdraw. Since the order arrived in the middle of the action, soldiers of Poitou‚Äôs regiment wanted to continue the fight and asked for the flag. This was a dangerous moment, with bullets flying everywhere. Danois ordered a withdrawal because many higher-ranking officers were either killed or badly wounded, but the soldiers did not obey. They knew it would be a precarious withdrawal and decided to take down the palisade instead. They were fortunate that Colonel Salis left his position at that moment and attacked the redoubt from the rear. This action decided the battle: when the Sardinians moved to stop Salis' attack, a renewed charge by the French carried all before them and compelled the Sardinians to surrender. The battle finished one hour before the night of July 19, 1744. The Sardinian army lost 1,350 men. French losses were also significant. Aftermath Charles Emmanuel III removed all artillery from the forts of San Carlo and Bertola an Chateau when he heard of the defeat. He went to Chateau Dauphin to receive the 200 survivors of the Mount Caval massacre. Charles then left Chateau Dauphin and went to Sampeyre, where he met general Guibert, who was at Bicocca. He also gave orders to the knights of Cumiana to evacuate the Maira valley. Marquis de Frabosa was told to leave the Stura Valley and to reach the defensive line of Castigliole-Saluces, where the main army was waiting. The dead of Pierrelongue were buried on the battleground and the wounded were transferred to Chateau Dauphin. The French wounded were recovered in the ruins of the redoubt of Mount Cavallo. Danois, who was now the commander, permitted his soldiers three days of looting at Bellino and Chateau Dauphin. In the early hours of the 20th, French soldiers arrived at these two villages and pillaged houses and churches. In Bellino they killed two men and in Chateau Dauphin they took the abandoned supplies of the Sardinian forces. The village of Pontechianale was saved thanks to the generosity of Danois, but it had to give 50 men who were used for eight days to transport wounded French soldiers away from the front. Givri was taken to Lyon and died a few days later from his wounds. Conclusion The Comte de Gages, arriving with the Spanish Army too late to join in the engagement, wrote to his colleagues serving with the Infante Philip: \\"We may again find occasion to match French valour in this war, but no army will ever surpass the gallantry I saw at Casteldelfino.\\" Prince Conti, in a report to Louis XV of France, described it as: \\"the most brilliant and lively action that ever came to pass.\\" He added: \\"The men there showed valour beyond all humanity. Our brigades have doused themselves in glory.\\" While the action at Casteldelfino raged, the bulk of the Franco-Spanish army moved against the Sardinians in the Stura valley and skillfully swept past the enemy fortifications along the Stura di Demonte. The allies had reached the plains of southern Piedmont. This battle is sometimes now remembered as the \\"Battle of Pierrelongue\\", to distinguish it from the previous \\"Battle of Casteldelfino\\" (October 1743).

It is one of the very few performing arts and visual arts schools in Australia. All the students that attend the school are required to study drama, music, dance and visual arts subjects as part of the school‚Äôs curriculum for the first year of secondary school, and one Performing or Visual Arts subject until year 11. The school participates in a number of events both on and off campus in all types of performing and visual arts as well as video, technical, costume and design. The school is run by the New South Wales Department of Education. As of February 2020, the principal is Sharon Roberts. The school caters for approximately 1,000 students from Year 7 to Year 12.  History  The school was founded in 1990 as the first state selective high school for performing arts in New South Wales. NHSPA was formed from the merger of the nearby Petersham Girls High School and Newtown Boys High School on the latter's King Street site. Newtown's foundation principal was Robin Amm, formerly the principal at Petersham Girls. The school remains open and accessible to the local population, however a larger percentage of prospective students from outside the local acceptance boundaries can audition to obtain a place at the school.  Campus  Cafe next to one entrance to the school The campus is located on King Street, Newtown and bounded by Newman and Whitehorse Streets. The campus has a large paved playground and a grass oval. The various faculties within the school are located in different areas ranging from A to H Blocks and the gymnasium (G block) located near the school oval. The school also has an operational theatre, known as the Studio Theatre, that it uses for its biannual Showcase concerts and other productions. The school also manages the adjacent St Georges Hall which is used for larger productions and school activities.  Students  Approximately 65 percent of the student body is recruited through a short audition process. Thirty pupils are in the music class, thirty in drama, and thirty in dance per year, although families living within the catchment area are prioritised to send their children there. Students can audition to gain entry to the school for Years 7 and 11. = Student leadership =  Prefect body  The Prefect body at NHSPA consists of Year 12 students who are elected by both their fellow students and teachers. Its primary role is act as role models for other students and represent the school at any public event. Student Representative Council Newtown High School of the Performing Arts has an elected Student Representative Council (SRC) composed of two students from each grade. Members are elected for a one-year term by the students. The SRC underwent significant reform in 2004 when the students drafted and adopted a formal constitution, and the council changed from a volunteer institution to its current elected structure. The SRC's primary objectives are to provide input on policy that affects students and to run charity fundraisers.

Photo from Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Utah. Relative dating is the science of determining the relative order of past events (i.e., the age of an object in comparison to another), without necessarily determining their absolute age (i.e. estimated age). In geology, rock or superficial deposits, fossils and lithologies can be used to correlate one stratigraphic column with another. Prior to the discovery of radiometric dating in the early 20th century, which provided a means of absolute dating, archaeologists and geologists used relative dating to determine ages of materials. Though relative dating can only determine the sequential order in which a series of events occurred, not when they occurred, it remains a useful technique. Relative dating by biostratigraphy is the preferred method in paleontology and is, in some respects, more accurate. The Law of Superposition, which states that older layers will be deeper in a site than more recent layers, was the summary outcome of 'relative dating' as observed in geology from the 17th century to the early 20th century. Geology The regular order of the occurrence of fossils in rock layers was discovered around 1800 by William Smith. While digging the Somerset Coal Canal in southwest England, he found that fossils were always in the same order in the rock layers. As he continued his job as a surveyor, he found the same patterns across England. He also found that certain animals were in only certain layers and that they were in the same layers all across England. Due to that discovery, Smith was able to recognize the order that the rocks were formed. Sixteen years after his discovery, he published a geological map of England showing the rocks of different geologic time eras. =Principles of relative dating= Methods for relative dating were developed when geology first emerged as a natural science in the 18th century. Geologists still use the following principles today as a means to provide information about geologic history and the timing of geologic events. Uniformitarianism The principle of Uniformitarianism states that the geologic processes observed in operation that modify the Earth's crust at present have worked in much the same way over geologic time.Reijer Hooykaas, Natural Law and Divine Miracle: The Principle of Uniformity in Geology, Biology, and Theology , Leiden: EJ Brill, 1963. A fundamental principle of geology advanced by the 18th century Scottish physician and geologist James Hutton, is that \\"the present is the key to the past.\\" In Hutton's words: \\"the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen to be happening now.\\" Intrusive relationships The principle of intrusive relationships concerns crosscutting intrusions. In geology, when an igneous intrusion cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock, it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock. There are a number of different types of intrusions, including stocks, laccoliths, batholiths, sills and dikes. Cross-cutting relationships Cross-cutting relations can be used to determine the relative ages of rock strata and other geological structures. Explanations: A ‚Äì folded rock strata cut by a thrust fault; B ‚Äì large intrusion (cutting through A); C ‚Äì erosional angular unconformity (cutting off A & B) on which rock strata were deposited; D ‚Äì volcanic dyke (cutting through A, B & C); E ‚Äì even younger rock strata (overlying C & D); F ‚Äì normal fault (cutting through A, B, C & E). The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault. Inclusions and components The principle of inclusions and components explains that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts) are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them. Original horizontality The principle of original horizontality states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments supports this generalization (although cross- bedding is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal). Superposition The law of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. This is because it is not possible for a younger layer to slip beneath a layer previously deposited. The only disturbance that the layers experience is bioturbation, in which animals and/or plants move things in the layers. however, this process is not enough to allow the layers to change their positions. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of vertical time line, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed. Faunal succession The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found. Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time.As recounted in Simon Winchester, The Map that Changed the World (New York: HarperCollins, 2001), pp. 59‚Äì91. Lateral continuity Schematic representation of the principle of lateral continuity The principle of lateral continuity states that layers of sediment initially extend laterally in all directions; in other words, they are laterally continuous. As a result, rocks that are otherwise similar, but are now separated by a valley or other erosional feature, can be assumed to be originally continuous. Layers of sediment do not extend indefinitely; rather, the limits can be recognized and are controlled by the amount and type of sediment available and the size and shape of the sedimentary basin. Sediment will continue to be transported to an area and it will eventually be deposited. However, the layer of that material will become thinner as the amount of material lessens away from the source. Often, coarser-grained material can no longer be transported to an area because the transporting medium has insufficient energy to carry it to that location. In its place, the particles that settle from the transporting medium will be finer-grained, and there will be a lateral transition from coarser- to finer- grained material. The lateral variation in sediment within a stratum is known as sedimentary facies. If sufficient sedimentary material is available, it will be deposited up to the limits of the sedimentary basin. Often, the sedimentary basin is within rocks that are very different from the sediments that are being deposited, in which the lateral limits of the sedimentary layer will be marked by an abrupt change in rock type. Inclusions of igneous rocks Multiple melt inclusions in an olivine crystal. Individual inclusions are oval or round in shape and consist of clear glass, together with a small round vapor bubble and in some cases a small square spinel crystal. The black arrow points to one good example, but there are several others. The occurrence of multiple inclusions within a single crystal is relatively common Melt inclusions are small parcels or \\"blobs\\" of molten rock that are trapped within crystals that grow in the magmas that form igneous rocks. In many respects they are analogous to fluid inclusions. Melt inclusions are generally small ‚Äì most are less than 100 micrometres across (a micrometre is one thousandth of a millimeter, or about 0.00004 inches). Nevertheless, they can provide an abundance of useful information. Using microscopic observations and a range of chemical microanalysis techniques geochemists and igneous petrologists can obtain a range of useful information from melt inclusions. Two of the most common uses of melt inclusions are to study the compositions of magmas present early in the history of specific magma systems. This is because inclusions can act like \\"fossils\\" ‚Äì trapping and preserving these early melts before they are modified by later igneous processes. In addition, because they are trapped at high pressures many melt inclusions also provide important information about the contents of volatile elements (such as H2O, CO2, S and Cl) that drive explosive volcanic eruptions. Sorby (1858) was the first to document microscopic melt inclusions in crystals. The study of melt inclusions has been driven more recently by the development of sophisticated chemical analysis techniques. Scientists from the former Soviet Union lead the study of melt inclusions in the decades after World War II (Sobolev and Kostyuk, 1975), and developed methods for heating melt inclusions under a microscope, so changes could be directly observed. Although they are small, melt inclusions may contain a number of different constituents, including glass (which represents magma that has been quenched by rapid cooling), small crystals and a separate vapour-rich bubble. They occur in most of the crystals found in igneous rocks and are common in the minerals quartz, feldspar, olivine and pyroxene. The formation of melt inclusions appears to be a normal part of the crystallization of minerals within magmas, and they can be found in both volcanic and plutonic rocks. Included fragments The law of included fragments is a method of relative dating in geology. Essentially, this law states that clasts in a rock are older than the rock itself.See \\"Reading Rocks by Wesleyan University\\" retrieved May 8, 2011 One example of this is a xenolith, which is a fragment of country rock that fell into passing magma as a result of stoping. Another example is a derived fossil, which is a fossil that has been eroded from an older bed and redeposited into a younger one.D. Armstrong, F. Mugglestone, R. Richards and F. Stratton, OCR AS and A2 Geology, Pearson Education Limited, 2008, p. 276 This is a restatement of Charles Lyell's original principle of inclusions and components from his 1830 to 1833 multi-volume Principles of Geology, which states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts) are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them... =Planetology= Relative dating is used to determine the order of events on Solar System objects other than Earth; for decades, planetary scientists have used it to decipher the development of bodies in the Solar System, particularly in the vast majority of cases for which we have no surface samples. Many of the same principles are applied. For example, if a valley is formed inside an impact crater, the valley must be younger than the crater. Craters are very useful in relative dating; as a general rule, the younger a planetary surface is, the fewer craters it has. If long-term cratering rates are known to enough precision, crude absolute dates can be applied based on craters alone; however, cratering rates outside the Earth- Moon system are poorly known. Archaeology Relative dating methods in archaeology are similar to some of those applied in geology. The principles of typology can be compared to the biostratigraphic approach in geology.

Tempo credited him as Father of the Republic of Indonesia (Indonesian: Bapak Republik Indonesia).  Biography  = Early life = Tan Malaka's full name was Ibrahim Gelar Datuk Sutan Malaka. His given name was Ibrahim, while Tan Malaka was a semi-aristocrat name which came from his maternal line. He was born in present-day Nagari Pandam Gadang, Suliki, Limapuluh Koto, West Sumatra, though his birthdate is uncertain. His parents were HM. Rasad, an agricultural employee, and Rangkayo Sinah, a daughter of a respected person in the village. As a child Malaka studied religious knowledge and trained pencak silat. In 1908 Malaka attended Kweekschool, a state teacher's school, at Fort de Kock. According to his teacher, G. H. Horensma, although Malaka was sometimes disobedient, he was an excellent student. At this school, Malaka enjoyed his Dutch language lessons, so Horensma suggested that he become a Dutch teacher. He also was a skilled football player. He graduated from that school in 1913 and was offered a datuk title and a fianc√©e. However, he only accepted the title. He received the title after a traditional ceremony in 1913. = Education in the Netherlands 1913 ‚Äì 1919 = Although Malaka became a datuk, he left his village in October 1913 to study at Rijkskweekschool, a government teacher education school which was funded by engkus of his village. Arriving at the Netherlands, Malaka initially experienced a culture shock. He also, under-estimating the North European climate, was infected by a pleuritis in early 1914, which did not heal completely until in 1915. During his time in Europe, his knowledge about revolution as a mean to transformation of society started to increase. The first inspiration source was De Fransche Revolutie, a Dutch translation of a book by the German historian, author, journalist and social democratic politician Wilhelm Blos (on German Wikipedia) of 1889, about the French revolution and historical events in France from 1789 until 1804.Wilhelm Blos: Die Franz√∂sische Revolution. Volksth√ºmliche Darstellung der Ereignisse und Zust√§nde in Frankreich 1789 bis 1804, Verlag von A.H.W. Dietz, Stuttgart 1889 This book was given to him by Horensma. After the Russian Revolution of October 1917, Malaka increasingly became more and more interested in communism and socialism and communism contra reformist socialism. He was reading the books by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Lenin. Friedrich Nietzsche was also one of his early political role models, and may have given him the idea that one man could perform great deeds if he only dared to assume the role of hero. Nietzsche argued that what makes a hero (at least in Greek tragedy) is an interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian nature in man ‚Äì or between the controlled, distanced, structured logical planning (Apollonian) and the wild euphoric, closeness of experience (Dionysian). During this time, around 1917 ‚Äì 1920 Malaka highly disliked Dutch culture and was impressed by the German and American societies. He then signed up to be a German soldier; however, he was rejected because the German Army did not accept foreigners. There, Malaka met Henk Sneevliet, one of the founders of Indische Sociaal-Democratische Vereeniging (ISDV, forerunner of Partai Komunis Indonesia or PKI). Malaka was also interested in Sociaal- Democratische Onderwijzers Vereeniging (Association of Democrat Social Teachers). In November 1919 Malaka graduated and received his diploma for assistant teacher hulpacte. According to his father, during that time they communicated via mystical means called Tariqa. = Returning to the Dutch East Indies =  Teaching  After graduating, Malaka returned to his village. He accepted an offering by Dr. C. W. Janssen to teach the children of tea plantation coolies at Sanembah, Tanjung Morawa, Deli, East Sumatra. Malaka went there in December 1919 and began teaching the children Malay in January 1920. In addition to teaching, he also produced subversive propaganda for the coolies, known as Deli Spoor. During this period he learned of the deterioration of the indigenous people that had occurred. He also made a contact with ISDV and wrote some works for the press. One of his earliest works was \\"Land of Paupers\\", which tells about the striking differences in wealth between capitalists and workers; it was included in Het Vrije Woord's March 1920 issue. Malaka also wrote about the suffering of the coolies in the Sumatera Post. In the Volksraad's 1920 election he was a leftist party candidate. He decided to resign on 23 February 1921.  Briefly Joining Partai Komunis Indonesia  Malaka chose Java island as the starting point of his struggle, considering that there were many figures who had the same view as him. He arrived in Batavia when his old teacher, Horensma, offered him a job as a teacher; however, Malaka rejected it. Malaka told that he wanted to establish a school; Horensma accepted the reason and supported him. Malaka arrived at Yogyakarta in early March 1921 and stayed at a house belonging to Sutopo, a former leader of Budi Utomo. There he wrote a proposal about grammar school. He participated in Sarekat Islam's 5th congress and met H.O.S. Tjokroaminoto, Agus Salim, Darsono, and Semaun. The congress discussed the topic of double membership. Agus Salim and Abdul Muis forbade it, while Semaun and Darsono were PKI members. Malaka offered a solution that excluded PKI because both organizations had the same vision; however, the prohibition was applied in the end. Sarekat Islam was split as a result, forming SI Putih (White SI), led by Tjokroaminoto, and SI Merah (Red SI), led by Semaun and based in Semarang. After the congress Malaka was asked by Semaun to go to Semarang to join PKI. He went to Semarang and then accepted it. Arriving in Semarang, Malaka became sick. A month later, he had returned to health and participated in a meeting with fellow SI Semarang members. The meeting concluded that a rival to government schools was needed. The school, named Sekolah Sarekat Islam (which was later better known as Sekolah Tan Malaka, and spread to Bandung and Ternate), opened to enrollment on 21 June 1921, the day after the meeting. As a guidebook for the schools, Malaka wrote SI Semarang dan Onderwijs. In June 1921 Malaka became the chairman of Serikat Pegawai Pertjitakan (Printing Workers Association) and served as the vice chairman and treasurer of Serikat Pegawai Pelikan Hindia (SPPH or Indies Oils Workers Association). Between May and August his first book, Sovjet atau Parlemen? (Soviet or Parliament?), was serialized in PKI's journal Soeara Ra'jat; his other works, including articles, were published in the journal and PKI's newspaper Sinar Hindia. In June he was one of the leaders of Revolutionaire Vakcentrale and in August he was elected to the editorial board of SPPH's journal Soeara Tambang. Malaka then replaced Semaun, who left the Dutch East Indies in October, as the chairman of PKI after a congress on 24‚Äì25 December 1921 in Semarang. Whilst Semaun was more cautious, Malaka was more radical. Malaka also maintained a good relationship with Sarekat Islam. The Dutch East Indies' government felt threatened and arrested Malaka on 13 February 1922 in Bandung when he visited the branch school. He was first exiled to Kupang; however, he wanted to be exiled to the Netherlands. He left the Dutch East Indies in March and arrived in the Netherlands on 1 May. = Exile = Malaka joined Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN) and was appointed as the third candidate of the party for Tweede Kamer at the 1922 elections for the Estates- General of the Netherlands. He was the first subject of the Dutch East Indies ever to run for office in the Netherlands. He did not expect to be elected because, under the system of proportional representation in use, his third position on the ticket made his election highly unlikely. His stated goal in running was instead to gain a platform to speak about Dutch actions in Indonesia, and to work to persuade the CPN to support Indonesian independence. Although he did not win a seat, he received unexpectedly strong support. Before the counting of votes was finished, he went to Germany. In Berlin he met Darsono, an Indonesian communist who was related to the West European Bureau of the Comintern, and possibly met M.N. Roy. Malaka then continued to Moscow, and arrived in October 1922 to participate in the Executive Committee of the Comintern. At the Fourth World Congress in Moscow, 1922, Malaka proposed that communism and Pan-Islamism could collaborate; however, his proposal was rejected. In January 1923 Malaka and Semaun were appointed correspondents of Die Rote Gewerkschafts-Internationale. During the first half of that year he also wrote for the journals of the Indonesian and Dutch labor movements. He also became an agent of the Eastern Bureau of the Comintern as he reported on the ECCI plenum in June 1923. Malaka went to Canton, arriving in December 1923, and edited English journal The Dawn for an organization of transport workers of the Pacific. In August 1924 Malaka requested the government of the Dutch East Indies to allow him to return home because of illness. The government accepted this, but with burdensome terms to be imposed; Malaka thus did not return home. In December 1924 PKI began to collapse, as it was suppressed by the government. As a response, Malaka wrote Naar de Republiek Indonesia (Towards the Republic of Indonesia), which was published in Canton in April 1925. It explains the situation in the world, from the Netherlands which suffered an economic crisis, the Dutch East Indies which had opportunities to carry out a revolution by nationalist movements and PKI, to his prediction that the United States and Japan would \\"settle with the sword which of them is the more powerful in the Pacific.\\" In July 1925 Tan Malaka moved to Manila, Philippines, because the environment was similar to Indonesia. Malaka arrived in Manila on 20 July. There he became a correspondent of the nationalist newspaper El Debate, edited by Francisco Varona. Publication of Malaka's works, such as a second edition of Naar de Republiek Indonesia (December 1925) and Semangat Moeda (Young Spirit; 1926) might have been supported by Varona. There Malaka also met Mariano de los Santos, Jos√© Abad Santos, and Crisanto Evangelista. In Indonesia, PKI decided to revolt within six months of its meeting, which was held around Christmas 1925. The government was aware of this and exiled several party leaders. In February 1926, Alimin went to Manila to request approval from Malaka. Malaka eventually rejected this strategy and stated that the condition of the party was still too weak and had no power yet to carry out a revolution. He described in his autobiography his frustration with his inability to secure information about events in Indonesia from his place in the Philippines, and his lack of influence with the PKI's leadership. As Comintern representative for Southeast Asia, Tan Malaka argued that he had authority to reject the PKI's plan, an assertion which was, in retrospect, denied by certain former PKI members. Malaka sent Alimin to Singapore to convey his views and ordered him to organize an impromptu meeting between the leaders. Seeing no progress, Malaka went to Singapore to meet Alimin and learned that Alimin and Muso had traveled to Moscow to seek help to carry out a revolt. In Singapore, Malaka met Subakat, another PKI leader, who shared his views. They decided to thwart Muso and Alimin's plan. During this period Malaka wrote Massa Actie (Mass Action), which contains his view on Indonesian revolution and nationalist movements. In this book Malaka proposes Aslia, a social federation between Southeast Asia countries and northern Australia. This book was intended to support his effort to reverse the direction of PKI and gain support of cadres for his side. = Partai Republik Indonesia, Persatuan Perdjuangan, later life, and death = In December 1926 Malaka went to Bangkok, where he studied the defeat of PKI. Malaka, along with Djamaludin Tamin and Subakat, established Partai Republik Indonesia (PARI) in early June 1927, distancing himself from the Comintern as well as, in the new party's manifesto, criticizing the PKI. While PARI did have a small membership inside the country, it never grew to be a large organization; however, with the PKI gone underground, it was the only organization in the late 1920s that was publicly calling for immediate independence for Indonesia. Some of party cadres were Adam Malik, Chaerul Saleh, Mohammad Yamin, and Iwa Kusumantri. Malaka went back to the Philippines in August 1927. The Dutch wanted to expel Malaka to Digul concentration camp, and Malaka was arrested on 12 August 1927 on charges entering illegally the Philippines territory. Dr. San Jose Abad helped him in the court; however, Malaka accepted the verdict that he would be deported to Amoy (Xiamen), China. The police of the Kulangsu (Gulangyu) International Settlement, notified of Tan Malaka's passage to Amoy, waited for him in the harbor with the intention of arresting him for extradition to the Dutch East Indies, but he managed to escape as the sympathetic captain and crew protected him, entrusting his safety to a ship inspector. The ship inspector took Tan Malaka to a guest house from where he made his way to Sionching village with newly made acquaintances. Malaka then traveled to Shanghai in the end of 1929. Poeze writes that Malaka may have met Alimin there in August 1931, and made an agreement with him that Malaka would work again for the Comintern. Malaka moved to Shanghai in September 1932 after the attack made by the Japanese forces, and decided to go to India, disguised as a Chinese-Filipino and using an alias. When he was in Hong Kong in early October 1932, he was arrested by British officials from Singapore, and was detained for several months. He hoped to have a chance to argue his case under British law and possibly seek asylum in the United Kingdom, but after several months of interrogation and being moved between the \\"European\\" and the \\"Chinese\\" sections of the jail, it was decided that he would simply be exiled from Hong Kong without charges. He was then deported again to Amoy. Malaka escaped once again, and traveled to Iwe village in the south of China. There he was treated with traditional Chinese medicine for his illness. After his health improved in the beginning of 1936, he traveled back to Amoy and formed the Foreign Language School. Abidin Kusno argues that this stay in Shanghai was an important period in shaping Tan Malaka's later actions during the Indonesian revolution of the late 1940s; the port city was nominally under Chinese sovereignty but was dominated first by European nations with trading concessions in the city, and then by Japan after its September 1932 invasion. The oppression of the Chinese he saw under both of these powers, Kusno argues, contributed to his uncompromising position against collaboration with the Japanese or negotiation with the Dutch in the 1940s, when many prominent Indonesian nationalists were adopting a more conciliatory stance. In August 1937 he went to Singapore under a fake Chinese identity and became a teacher. After the Dutch surrendered to Japan he returned to Indonesia via Penang. He then sailed to Sumatra arriving in Jakarta in mid-1942, where he wrote Madilog. After he felt he had to have a job, he applied to Social Welfare Agency and was soon sent to a coal mine in Bayah, on southern coast of West Java. After the proclamation of the independence of Indonesia, he began to meet his people of his own and the younger generation. He also started to use his real name after 20 years using aliases. He then traveled to in Java and saw Surabaya people fighting against the British army in November. He realized the differences of struggling between the people in some places and the leaders in Jakarta. He thought the leaders were too weak in negotiation with the Dutch. Tan Malaka's solution to this perceived disconnect was to found the Persatuan Perjuangan (Struggle Front, or United Action), a coalition of about 140 smaller groups, notably not including the PKI. After a few months of discussion, the coalition was formally founded at a congress in Surakarta (Solo) in mid-January 1946. It adopted a \\"Minimum Program\\", which declared that only complete independence was acceptable, that government must obey the wishes of the people, and that foreign-owned plantations and industry should be nationalized. The Persatuan Perjuangan had widespread popular support, as well as support in the republican army, where General Sudirman was a strong supporter of the coalition Tan Malaka was organizing. In February 1946, the organization forced the temporary resignation of Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir, a proponent of negotiation with the Dutch, and Sukarno consulted with Tan Malaka to seek his support. However, Tan Malaka was apparently unable to bridge political divisions within his coalition to transform it into actual political control, and Syahrir returned to lead Sukarno's cabinet. Upon his release, he spent late 1948 in Yogyakarta, working to form a new political party, called the Partai Murba (Proletarian Party), but was unable to repeat his previous success at attracting a following. When the Dutch captured the national government in December 1948, he fled the city for rural East Java, where he hoped he would be protected by anti-republican guerrilla forces. He established his headquarters in Blimbing, a village surrounded by rice fields, and connected himself to Major Sabarudin, leader of Battalion 38. In Malaka's opinion, Sabarudin's was the only armed group that was really fighting the Dutch. Sabarudin, however, was in conflict with all other armed groups. On 17 February, the TNI leaders in East Java decided that Sabarudin and his companions were to be captured and convicted following military law. On the 19th, they captured Tan Malaka in Blimbing. On 20 February, the infamous Dutch Korps Speciale Troepen (KST) happened to start the so-called \\"operation Tiger\\" from the East Javanese town of Nganjuk. They advanced quickly and brutally. Poeze describes in detail how the TNI soldiers fled into the mountains and how Tan Malaka, already injured, walked into a TNI-post and was promptly executed on 21 February 1949. Malaka was fatally shot at the foothills of Mount Wilis, Selopanggung, Kediri Regency after an arrest and detention in Patje village. According to Poeze, the shot was ordered by Second Lieutenant Sukotjo of Sikatan battalion, Brawijaya division. No report was made and Malaka was buried in the woods.  Thought  = Marxism and religion = Tan Malaka argued strongly that communism and Islam were compatible, and that, in Indonesia, revolution should be built upon both. Thus, he was a strong supporter of the PKI's continued alliance with Sarekat Islam (SI), and was troubled when, while he was in exile, the PKI broke away from SI. On an international scale, Tan Malaka also saw Islam as holding the potential for unifying the working classes in vast parts of North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia against imperialism and capitalism. This position put him in opposition to many European Communists and the leadership of Comintern, who saw religious belief as a hindrance to a proletarian revolution and a tool of the ruling class. = Politics = Malaka described Nietzsche's, Rousseau's, and Marx-Engels' thoughts as thesis, antithesis, and synthesis respectively; while he described Wilhelm-Hindenburg-Stinnes', Danton-Robespierre-Marat's, and the Bolsheviks' thoughts as genesis, negation, and the negation of negation respectively. = Sociology = = Education = According to Harry A. Poeze, Malaka assumed that the colonial government used the educational system to produce educated indigenous people who would repress their own people. Malaka founded Sekolah Sarekat Islam to rival the government schools. Syaifudin writes that Malaka had four different methods of teaching: dialog, jembatan keledai, critical discussion, and sociodrama. In dialog method, Malaka used two-way communication while teaching. During his time teaching in Deli, he encouraged students to criticize their teacher, or the Dutchman, who was often wrong. In the SI school, he entrusted students who received higher grades to teach students with lower grades. Jembatan keledai was inspired by al-Ghazali; in addition to memorizing knowledge, the students were instructed to understand and apply it to their daily lives. Syaifudin writes that it is the opposite of bank style concept, and that it is similar to contextual teaching and learning. On critical discussion, Malaka not only verbally gave a problem to the students, but attempted to expose the problem directly, a method is similar to the problem-posing method of Paulo Freire. With his fourth method, sociodrama, Malaka aimed to make the students understand social problems and resolve them through role playing, and to provide entertainment to amuse the students after studying.  Legacy  Indonesian historians describe Malaka as a \\"communist, nationalist, national communist, Trotskyist, idealist, Muslim leader, and Minangkabau chauvinist\\". Tan Malaka's best-known written work is his autobiography, Dari Pendjara ke Pendjara. He wrote the three-volume work by hand while imprisoned by the republican Sukarno government in 1947 and 1948. The work alternates between theoretical chapters describing Tan Malaka's political beliefs and philosophy and more conventional autobiographical chapters that discuss various phases of his life. Volume three has an especially loose narrative structure, containing commentary on Marxist historiography, his positions on the ongoing fight with the Netherlands over Indonesia's independence, and reprints of sections of key documents related to the struggle. Dari Pendjara ke Pendjara is one of a very small number of autobiographies set in colonial Indonesia. The translated book, From Jail to Jail (1991), attracted the English speaking labor movement's attention.

Life He was the eldest son of Robert Hamilton, Lord Presmennan (d. 1696). Having married Margaret, granddaughter of John Hamilton, 1st Lord Belhaven and Stenton; who had been made a peer by Charles I in 1647, he succeeded to this title in 1679. In 1681, he was imprisoned for opposing the government and for speaking slightingly of James, duke of York, afterwards James VII and II, in parliament, and in 1689 he was among those who asked William of Orange to undertake the government of Scotland. Belhaven was at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689. He was a member of the Scottish privy council. He was a director of and invested heavily in the Scottish Trading Company, which was formed in 1695 and was responsible for the ill-fated Darien scheme to set up a Scots colony on the Darien peninsula in Panama. He was also a proponent of agricultural improvement publishing a handbook, The Countryman's Rudiments in 1699. He favoured the agitation for securing greater liberty for his country, an agitation which culminated in the passing of the Act of Security in 1705, and he greatly disliked the union of the parliaments, a speech which he delivered against this proposal in November 1706 attracting much notice. He was, along with Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, one of the most eloquent of politicians. Two of his speeches, one being the famous one of November 1706, were published in an appendix to Daniel Defoe's History of the Union (first printed in 1710). Later he was imprisoned, ostensibly for favouring a projected French invasion, and he died in London on 21 June 1708. Belhaven's son, John, who fought on the British Government side at the Battle of Sheriffmuir, became the 3rd Lord on his father's death. He was drowned in November 1721, whilst proceeding to take up his duties as governor of Barbados, and was succeeded by his son John (d. 1764). After the death of John's brother James in 1777 the title was for a time dormant; then in 1799 the House of Lords declared that William Hamilton (1765‚Äì1814), a descendant of John Hamilton, the paternal great-grandfather of the 2nd Lord, was entitled to the dignity. William, who became the 7th Lord, was succeeded by his son Robert (1793‚Äì1868), who was created a peer of the United Kingdom as Baron Hamilton of Wishaw in 1831. He died without issue in December 1868, when the barony of Hamilton became extinct; in 1875 the House of Lords declared that his cousin, James Hamilton (1822‚Äì1893) was rightfully Lord Belhaven and Stenton, and the title descended to his kinsman, Alexander Charles (b. 1840), the 10th Lord.

Early career Bowen was born in North Adelaide, an inner suburb of Adelaide, South Australia, and educated at Tormore House School. As a young girl, Bowen enjoyed drawing and convinced her mother to allow her to study with Margaret Preston. However, her desire to pursue art training in Melbourne was thwarted by the ill health of her mother and the latter's reluctance to let her daughter follow such a career. When her mother died in 1914, Bowen left for England with a return ticket and an allowance of ¬£20 per month. In cosmopolitan London, she studied at the Westminster School of Art and mixed with a company of writers, artists, poets and political activists. Early in 1918,\\"Bowen, Stella, Drawn from Life, Picador (1941, reprinted 1999) p 67 Bowen met and fell in love with the writer Ford Madox Ford. She was 24, he was 44. The couple fled to rural England where their daughter Julia was born in 1920. However, by 1922, the family were fed up with the hardships of life in the English countryside and moved temporarily to France. They soon decided to remain in France and moved to Paris. Caught up in the bohemian caf√© society of Paris, Ford started a literary magazine and was a leading figure among the expatriate writers. Bowen, meanwhile, found her first studio but managed little time for painting in between attending to the needs of Ford and their daughter. Later years Bowen separated from Ford in 1927. It was a difficult time for her but it did give her the time and space to pursue her art. She began to gain some portrait commissions but still struggled to earn enough money. In 1932, she went to the United States at the invitation of the poet Ramon Guthrie, who helped her in finding commissions including, among others, with Sinclair Lewis. When she returned to France she found she could not afford to remain in Paris and returned to England on her fortieth birthday. Although Bowen continued to paint she did not earn enough from painting and commissions to make ends meet and for many years supplemented her income by writing an art review column in the News Chronicle and teaching. Because of her relationship with Ford Madox Ford she was given an advance to write a biography and produced Drawn from life : a memoir. This book came out to glowing reviews. World War II ‚Äì war artist The Second World War brought a new chapter in Bowen's career. In 1944, she was appointed an official war artist by the Australian War Memorial. Theaden Brocklebank, a producer with the Pacific service of the BBC and wife of William Keith Hancock, had arranged for Stella Bowen to record regular talks for Australian audiences about her wartime experiences. These talks provided Bowen with additional income during a difficult time and they resulted in the offer of the position of war artist. Bowen's brief as a war artist was to depict the activities of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) stationed in England. She also painted portraits of military commanders and Australian prisoners of war who had recently been repatriated from Europe. One of the early women artists to be appointed, Bowen completed her last painting in 1947. She died later that year of breast and liver cancer, having never returned to Australia. Two portraits by Bowen are in the National Portrait Gallery collection, George Douglas Howard Cole and Dame Margaret Isabel Cole. Her portrait of Ramon Guthrie done in Paris in the 1920s is in the collection of the Hood Museum of Dartmouth College.

Under United States law, FRCP 64 provides with several types of seizure (e.g. garnishment, replevin, attachment) that a Federal Court may use pursuant to state law. FRCP 65 concerns Temporary Restraining Order (may be made ex parte) and preliminary injunction (requires some hearing). In order to establish the constitutionality of a provisional remedy, two cases must be distinguished. The 3-part test established in Matthews determines whether a prejudgment remedy meets the constitutional requirements when Government seeks deprivation on its own initiative. The court must take into consideration the private interest of the party against whom the remedy is sought, the risk of erroneous deprivation as well as the probable value, if any, of addition or substitute safeguards and, the moving party's interest. The 3-part test established in Connecticut v. Doehr determines whether a prejudgment remedy meets the constitutional requirements when Government action is applied to a suit between private parties. The due process analysis involves the same requirements as set forth in Matthews. The court must also take into account whether there are exigent circumstances, a bond requirement, a judicial assessment, a detailed statement of factual basis, and a prompt post-seizure hearing.

However, the idea of \\"Taiwan retrocession\\" is in dispute. Historical background Chen I (right) accepting the receipt of Order No. 1 signed by Rikichi And≈ç (left), the last Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, on behalf of the Republic of China Armed Forces at Taipei City Hall. Taiwan, then more commonly known to the Western world as \\"Formosa\\", became a colony of the Empire of Japan when the Qing Empire lost the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 and ceded the island with the signing of the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki. Japanese rule in Taiwan lasted until the end of World War II. In November 1943, Chiang Kai-shek took part in the Cairo Conference with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, who firmly advocated that Japan be required to return all of the territory it had annexed into its empire, including Taiwan and the Penghu (Pescadores) Islands. Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation, drafted by the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union and China in July 1945, reiterated that the provisions of the Cairo Declaration be thoroughly carried out, and the Japanese Instrument of Surrender stated Japan's agreement to the terms of the Potsdam Proclamation. Under the authorization of American General Douglas MacArthur's General Order No. 1, Chen I (Chief Executive of Taiwan Province) was escorted by George Kerr to Taiwan to accept the Japanese government's surrender as the Chinese delegate. When the Japanese surrendered at the end of World War II, General Rikichi And≈ç, governor-general of Taiwan and commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces on the island, signed an instrument of surrender and handed it over to governor-general of Taiwan Chen I, representing the Republic of China Armed Forces to complete the official turnover in Taipei (known during occupation as Taihoku) on October 25, 1945, at Taipei City Hall (now Zhongshan Hall). Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be \\"Retrocession Day\\" and organized the island into the Taiwan Province of the Republic of China. Taiwan has since been governed by the Government of the Republic of China. Controversy * Taiwanese historian claims the following: After World War II ended, Republic of China officials traveled to Taiwan to accept the surrender of Japanese forces on behalf of the Allied Powers. Although they claimed that it was \\"Taiwan Retrocession\\", Lee claims it was actually a provisional military occupation and was not a transfer of territories of Taiwan and Penghu. A transfer of territory requires a conclusion of an international treaty in order to be valid. But before the government of the Republic of China was able to conclude a treaty with Japan, it was overthrown by the Chinese Communist party and fled its territory. Consequently, that attributed to the controversy of the \\"Undetermined Status of Taiwan\\" and the controversy over \\"Taiwan Retrocession\\". * In a lengthy legal essay published in Tokyo in 1972, Chairman Ng Chiau-tong, World United Formosans for Independence, analyzed the British Parliamentary records and other documents before concluding that the legal status of Taiwan was undetermined. * Writing in the American Journal of International Law in July 2000, Jonathan I. Charney and J. R. V. Prescott maintained that the Chinese Nationalists (ROC) began a military occupation of Taiwan in 1945 as a result of Japan's surrender, and that none of the post- World War II peace treaties explicitly ceded sovereignty over Formosa and the Pescadores to any specific state or government. * The official position of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China is that Taiwan and Penghu were returned to the Republic of China according to the terms of the 1945 Japanese Instrument of Surrender, which stipulated Japan's compliance with the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. The Potsdam Declaration in turn included the terms of the Cairo Declaration, which required Japan to return all conquered territories to China, including Taiwan and the Pescadores. * The Democratic Progressive Party, which rejects the idea of Taiwan being taken back by China, downplayed the event during their two terms of presidency from 2000 to 2008. * Because the Republic of China officials who accepted the surrenders of Japanese Forces in 1945 were all representatives of the Allies of World War II, there are opinions that Japanese Forces on Taiwan actually surrendered to the Allies, not to the Republic of China, and therefore the so- called \\"Taiwan Retrocession Day\\" is merely \\"Surrenders of Japanese Forces to the Allies Day\\", which marked the beginning of military occupation and was not a retrocession. The opinions further believe that \\"Taiwan Retrocession\\" is a misleading term. Taiwan independence viewpoint Supporters of Taiwan independence have argued that Taiwanese retrocession was invalid since there is no precedent in international law in which an instrument of surrender effected a transfer of sovereignty, and they base their belief in part on both a declassified CIA report from March 1949 confirming that Taiwan was not a part of the Republic of China and President Truman's 27 June 1950, statement regarding Taiwan's \\"undetermined status\\", which they hold as proof of the leading Allies' views. As late as November 1950, the United States State Department announced that no formal act restoring sovereignty over Formosa and the Pescadores to China had yet occurred; British officials reiterated this viewpoint in 1955, saying that \\"The Chinese Nationalists began a military occupation of Formosa and the Pescadores in 1945. However, these areas were under Japanese sovereignty until 1952.\\" See also * Holidays in Taiwan * Victory over Japan Day * Political status of Taiwan * Zhongshan Hall * Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan References External links * Taiwan's Retrocession Day on the Government Information Office website of the Republic of China on Taiwan Category:October observances Category:Taiwan under Japanese rule Category:Taiwan under Republic of China rule Category:1945 in Taiwan Category:1945 in China ","title":"Retrocession Day"},{"id":"2992682","text":"William Kenneth Hastings was New Zealand's tenth Chief Censor, from October 1999 to July 2010. He was Chairperson of the Immigration and Protection Tribunal from July 2010 until February 2013, and is currently a District Court Judge. Biography Born in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada in 1957, he attended Lord Roberts Public School, and graduated from Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute. He holds a BA from the University of Trinity College, University of Toronto; law degrees from Osgoode Hall Law School, the London School of Economics, and Duke University; and was a practising barrister. He moved to New Zealand in 1985. Before becoming Chief Censor, he was Deputy and Acting Chief Censor from December 1998 to October 1999, Senior Lecturer in Law (teaching Legal System and International Law), Deputy Dean of Law, and a member of the governing Council, at Victoria University of Wellington. He was also briefly the Video Recordings Authority in 1994, a member of the Indecent Publications Tribunal from 1990 to 1994 and Deputy President of the Film and Literature Board of Review from 1995 to 1998. In 2010 he stood down as Chief Censor when he became a District Court Judge and Chair of the Immigration and Protection Tribunal. He was succeeded by Andrew Jack. Role as Chief Censor In 1998, he was appointed Deputy Chief Censor at the Office of Film and Literature Classification by the Governor-General of New Zealand on the recommendation of the Jenny Shipley-led National coalition government. In 1999, he was appointed Chief by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Helen Clark-led Labour coalition government for a three-year term in 1999, a one-year term in 2002, another three-year term in 2003 and a third three- year term late in 2006. In 2002, Hastings appeared in the public eye when he made censorship decisions on highly controversial films, particularly Baise- moi and Visitor Q, both of which were scheduled for screening at the Beck's Incredible Film Festival. In 2003, Hastings again appeared in the public eye when the computer game Manhunt was banned by his office, making its possession in New Zealand illegal. Following a meeting in Toronto on 22 December 2003 between Hastings and officials from the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Business Services, Manhunt became the first computer game in Ontario to be classified as a film and restricted to adults in February 2004. The Society for the Promotion of Community Standards in particular has accused Hastings of being a \\"gay activist\\" promoting homosexuality and promiscuity by giving too liberal classifications to films. This estimation is contradicted by examination of the appeals against classifications; the Film and Literature Board of Review found classifications too liberal in only 3.5% of cases under Hastings ‚Äì in contrast to 27% under his predecessor, Kathryn Paterson ‚Äì and has upheld 82% of OFLC decisions made under Hastings. Apart from his professional role, some have taken issue with one aspect of his personal life in particular: Hastings is openly homosexual. Some of these critics include the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards; Graham Capill, former Leader of the Christian Heritage Party; Brian Tamaki in the \\"Media: The New Witchcraft\\" section of a DVD produced by the Destiny Church for the 2005 general election; Peter Brown MP, Deputy Leader of the New Zealand First Party; and Pastor Ralph Ovadal's Pilgrims Covenant Church, a fundamentalist Christian church in Monroe, Wisconsin. Indeed, one commentator has said that Hastings' gay identity \\"has become a valuable touchstone, frequently revealing the real agenda of certain pro-censorship pressure groups.\\" On 21 June 2010, Hastings was appointed a District Court Judge and Chair of the Immigration and Protection Tribunal. Hastings was sworn in at Wellington on 9 July 2010. In April 2013 he was succeeded as Chairperson of the Tribunal by Judge Carrie Wainwright and began sitting full-time as a District Court judge.

It is located at the point where the Canadian National Railways transcontinental main line crosses the Winnipeg River, between Wade to the west and Ena Lake at the east, and was accessible only by rail until about 1960. It was a fuelling and watering point in the days of steam locomotives; now few trains stop in Minaki, though the thrice- weekly Via Rail transcontinental Canadian passenger trains will stop on request at the Minaki railway station. Tourism is the economic mainstay of Minaki, with camps, lodges and marinas catering to anglers and hunters. It is the embarkation point for more than 100 water-access cottages on surrounding lakes. The largest group of cottagers are from Winnipeg, about 3¬Ω hours drive away, and from nearby U.S. states. History The westbound Canadian, Via Rail's transcontinental train, speeds through Minaki First nations people have lived on the Winnipeg River in the Minaki area for a millennium or more, judging by the potshards and arrow points that turn up along the shores. The river was a major canoe route for the explorers and fur traders in the early days of white settlement. In the nineteenth century the Hudson's Bay Company had a trading post a couple of kilometres north of the present community. The modern community of Minaki got its start about 1910 when the National Transcontinental Railway built a bridge across the river near where Skipper Holst had built a hotel a few years earlier and called the place Winnipeg River Crossing. The booming city of Winnipeg was about three hours travel to the west on the railway, and in no time there was a land boom in vacation properties on the small lakes along the railway. Train going through the town of Minaki The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, which operated the line for the National Transcontinental, built a rustic resort hotel that it called the Minaki Lodge and renamed the station Minaki, an Ojibwa word that has been variously translated as Beautiful Water or Good Land. Sunset Point shop on the water in Minaki Local government Minaki has no local government as it is an unincorporated community located in an unorganized area, outside any incorporated townships. The Minaki Local Roads Board maintains the few roads in the community. The Minaki Local Services Board provides recreation through the Minaki Community Association and fire protection through the Minaki United Fire Fighters. The local services board owns and operates the Minaki Community Hall and the Minaki Fire Hall. There is also a volunteer first response team. The Minaki Foundation, a registered charity incorporated in 1986, raises money to support these and other local initiatives. Geography Minaki is at the boundary where the white pine and yellow birch of the northwestern tip of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest meet the jack pine, black spruce and trembling aspen of the boreal forest. Most major stands of white pine were either cut by the Simpson and Short lumber company in the 1920s or destroyed by wildfires in the drought summers of the 1930s. The largest remaining stands of virgin pine timber, the trees that symbolize the rugged north for many Canadians, are on islands where they were protected from both logging and fire. Some areas north of the town have been or are being logged to supply the Kenora Forest Products lumber mill (now closed) and a Weyerhaeuser oriented strand-board mill, both in Kenora. Sign at the entrance of the town of Minaki Located about 45 minutes north of Kenora at the north end of paved Highway 596, the hamlet of Minaki is gateway to lakes and rivers of the Ontario portion of the Winnipeg River system, including Gun, Sand, Pistol and Roughrock lakes. Fly-in service is available to the English River and lakes farther north. Area lakes offer bass, muskie, northern pike and walleye. There are also many black bear, moose and deer in the rugged woods surrounding the town. Many islands scatter the lakes. The main vacation season is July and August, with the August long weekend the peak of the summer season. Anglers also visit in the spring and hunters in the fall. Visitors to Minaki are few in the November‚ÄìApril period, though snow- machine traffic from Kenora to points farther north passes a few kilometres away from the community. Year-round population of the immediate Minaki area is estimated by residents at about 130. At the height of summer, the seasonal population of surrounding lakes served through Minaki is about 1,000. The largest lake adjacent to Minaki is Sand Lake, which is north of the townsite. The part north of Harbour Island and Moore's Point is known as Big Sand Lake; the basin generally west of Harbour Island and Moore's Point is known as Little Sand Lake.

It bears the same name as Plato‚Äôs famous dialogue, The Laws. Unlike his previous work De re publica, in which Cicero felt compelled to set the action in the times of Scipio Africanus Minor, Cicero wrote this work as a fictionalized dialogue between himself, his brother Quintus and their mutual friend Titus Pomponius Atticus. The dialogue begins with the trio taking a leisurely stroll through Cicero's familial estate at Arpinum and they begin to discuss how the laws should be. Cicero uses this as a platform for expounding on his theories of natural law of harmony among the classes. The three surviving books (out of an indeterminate number, although Jonathan Powell and Niall Rudd in their translation for Oxford seem to argue that it may have been six, to bring it in line with the number in de re publica), in order, expound on Cicero's beliefs in Natural Law, recasts the religious laws of Rome (in reality a rollback to the religious laws under the king Numa Pompilius) and finally talk of his proposed reforms to the Roman Constitution. Whether or not the work was meant as an earnest plan of action is unknown. Cicero's basic conservative and traditionalist beliefs led him to imagine an idealized Rome before the Gracchi, with the classes still in harmony. From there, he reformed the worst points of the Roman constitution, while keeping the majority of it. Cicero's proposed constitution in Book Three must be seen as a renovation of the existing order, not a call to shatter the order and build anew. However, less than a decade after the accepted date for his beginning the manuscript, Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon, launching the civil war that would end the Republic.  Book One  The book opens with Cicero, Quintus and Atticus walking through the shaded groves at Cicero's Arpinum estate, when they happen across an old oak tree linked by legend to the general and consul Gaius Marius, who also was a native of Arpinum. Atticus questions whether or not it still exists, to which Quintus replies that so long as people remember the spot and the associations connected with it, the tree will exist regardless of its physical presence. This brings the trio into a discussion of the porous border between fact and fable in historians' writing of the day. Cicero lets on that even in their day, many of the stories of the Roman kings, such as Numa Pompilius conversing with the nymph Egeria, were thought of as fables or parables rather than as actual incidents which happened. Atticus takes the opportunity to prod Cicero to starting a promised work on Roman history (if such a work existed, it has not surfaced to any extent in modern times) and flatters him by pointing out that in any case, Cicero may be one of the more qualified men in Rome to do it, given the numerous flaws of Roman historians of the era. Cicero begs off, mentioning that he has his hands full with studying the law in preparation for cases. This brings us to the meat of the book, an exposition of the wellspring of the law. Atticus, as a divertissment, asks Cicero to put some of his knowledge to use right then and there and give them a discussion on the law as they walk across his estate. To Cicero, law was not a matter of written statutes, and lists of regulations, but was a matter deeply ingrained in the human spirit, one that was an integral part of the human experience. His reasoning goes thus: * Humans were created by a higher power or powers (and for the sake of argument, Cicero has the Epicurean Atticus concede the point that this higher power is engaged with the affairs of humanity). *This higher power which created the universe did, for reasons known to itself, endow humans with a bit of its own divinity, giving the human race the powers of speech, reason, and thought. **Due to this spark of divinity inside humans, they must de facto be related to the higher power in some fashion. *Because humans share reason with the higher power, and because this higher power is presumed to be benevolent, it follows that humans, when employing reason correctly, will likewise be benevolent. *This reason is what Cicero considers the law. To him, the law is whatever promotes good and forbids evil. What holds us back from upholding this absolutely is our human failings, our lusts for pleasure, wealth, status, other inconsequentials outside of virtue and honor.  Book Two  Book Two begins with Cicero espousing his beliefs on Natural Law. The party has made it to an island in the river Fibrenius where they sit and relax and resume their discussion. As the book begins, Cicero and Atticus argue about whether a person can hold patriotism for both one's larger country and the region therein that one hails from: i.e., can one love Rome and Arpinum at the same time? Cicero argues that not only can one, but it is natural. Cicero uses the example of Cato the Elder, who by dint of his birth in Tusculum was a Roman citizen yet could, with no hypocrisy, also call himself a Tuscan. However, Cicero also makes the important distinction that one's birthplace must take subordination to the land of one's citizenship‚Äîthat there is where one's duty is owed to and for which one must, if necessary, lay down one's life. Cicero also strengthens the link between him and Gaius Marius by having Atticus mention a speech by Pompey, who talked of Rome's debt to Arpinum, as its two greatest sons were also Rome's saviors. Once the trio reach the island, Cicero launches into an examination of law. He begins by saying that law does not, and cannot, begin with men. Men, to him, are the instruments of a higher wisdom which governs the entire earth and has the power, through shared morality, to command good or forbid evil. Cicero also makes a distinction in this section between legalism (actual written law) and law (right and wrong as dictated by the eternal wisdom). To Cicero, human laws can be good or ill depending on whether they are in sync with the eternal, natural law. A law enacted for a purely temporary or local purpose is law, according to him, by dint of public approval. It has force of law only so long as people observe it and the state enforces it. Natural law, however, needs no encoding, no enforcement. By way of example, Cicero mentions that when Sextus Tarquinius, son of King Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, raped Lucretia, there were no laws in Rome governing rape. However, even then, the populace knew viscerally that what had happened was against shared morality, and followed Lucius Junius Brutus to overthrow the Tarquins. Evil laws, or ones that go against the eternal law, further, do not deserve the title, and states that enact them to the exclusion of the eternal law do not deserve the title states. To demonstrate, Cicero uses the analogy of unschooled people or quacks passing themselves off as doctors and prescribing deadly treatments. No one in their right mind, Cicero argues, would dare call such treatments \\"medicine\\" or their practitioners \\"doctors\\". Cicero's insistence that religious belief (the belief in the gods, or God, or the Eternal wisdom) must be the cornerstone of law leads the trio, naturally, into the framing of religious laws. The laws proposed by Cicero seem to draw mostly from even then antique statutes from Rome's earliest days, including those of Numa Pompilius, the semi-legendary second king of Rome and the laws of the Twelve Tables, according to Quintus. From thence follows a long discussion on the merits of Cicero's hypothetical decrees. Among the things acknowledged in this section are the fact that at times religious laws have both a spiritual and a pragmatic purpose, as Cicero, when quoting the laws of the Twelve Tables and their injunction against burial or cremation within the pomerium, admits that the injunction is as much to appease fate (by not burying the dead where the living dwell) as it is to avoid calamity (by lessening the risk of fire in the city due to open-pyre cremation). After the discussions on religious laws, and with Cicero's stated objective to replicate Plato's feat by conducting a thorough discussion on the laws in one day, they move into civil law and the makeup of the government.  Book Three  Book Three, where the manuscript breaks off, is Cicero's enumeration of the set up of the government, as opposed to the religious laws of the previous book, that he would advocate as the basis for his reformed Roman state. = Outline of Cicero's proposed Constitution = * The Judicial System Cicero, who believed that the trial courts as he had seen them were too open to tampering through bribery or through sharp practice (as he had himself experienced and thwarted in the case of Gaius Verres), would place the trials back in the hands of the people at large, with the Comitia Centuriata trying cases where the penalty was death or exile, and the Concilium Plebis trying all other cases. A magistrate (Praetor or even Consul) would still preside over the trial. That same magistrate would then, upon a guilty verdict, impose a punishment unless a majority of the relevant assembly disagreed. During military campaigns, unlike in civilian trials, Cicero would remove the right of appeal from those convicted of wrongdoing. * The Senate The Senate, in Cicero's laws, would no longer exist as merely an advisory body, but would now hold actual legislative authority, and their decrees would be binding. Any former magistrate has the right to enter the Senate. In a later portion of the dialogue, Cicero defends the apparent democracy of the change by arguing that the quasi-aristocratic Senate would serve as a counterbalance to the populist and democratic popular assemblies. Further, Cicero would impose a stipulation that only those with thoroughly unblemished behavior and reputations could remain in the order ‚Äî the Censors could remove those who misbehaved at will. It was Cicero's stated hope that such a reformed Senate could serve as an example for the rest of the Roman state of probity, harmony, common interest and fair play. Acquisitiveness and greed in the Senate were to be severely punished, apparently, by Cicero's laws. This was not so much to punish the greed itself, but because greed in the Senate bred greed and dissent among the Romans. \\"If you're prepared to go back over the records of history, it is plain that the state has taken its character from that of its foremost men.\\" (III.31) ** The two Consuls, the Praetor, the Dictator, the Master of the Horse (his lieutenant), election officers and the tribunes would have the right to preside over Senate meetings. However, such meetings were to be held in what Cicero characterized as a \\"quiet, disciplined manner\\". ** Senators must also, by Cicero's hypothetical law, be current in important affairs of state whether or not it is the particular Senator's bailiwick. * Magistrates The basic outline of Roman society was to be kept (in keeping with Cicero's basic conservatism) but reforms to the structure were in his plan to prevent or reverse the decay of the state. From low to high, the proposed magistrates in Cicero's reformed Republic seem to be: **Quaestors, still with the power of the purse as normal, with the exception that Quaestorhood would no longer be the first step on the cursus honorum **A new magistrate who would be responsible for the safety of prisoners and the executing of sentences (he may have meant a normalization of the triumviri capitales as an elected magisterial post) **Minters and moneyers (again, a reform of the triumviri monetales) **An expansion, apparently, of the Board of Ten for Deciding Cases (or decemviri stlitibus iudicandis), whose purview would have been more than the citizenship and freedom/slavery cases they then judged (Cicero does not seem to elaborate ‚Äî it may have been in the lost portion of the work) **Aediles, who were still responsible for public works and welfare, and who would thenceforth be the first step on Cicero's reformed cursus honorum ** Censors, who, while holding their traditional post (conducting the census and permitting or denying membership in the Senatorial Order and otherwise ordering society), would now be a normalized elected post with the usual restriction of having been a former consul apparently removed. The Censors would also have the task of interpreting laws. *** At the end of a magistrate's tenure, he was to give a full account to the Censor of his actions in office, whereupon the Censor would judge his fitness to remain in the Senatorial Order. This did not absolve him from prosecution for his actions. ** A Praetor, responsible for civil cases and lawsuits. Along with him would be an indeterminate number of equally-empowered officials (although most likely under his direction ‚Äî again, Cicero does not elaborate overmuch) appointed by the Senate or popular assemblies. *** At the same time, any magistrate could preside over a trial and conduct auspices. ** At the top would be the two Consuls, as always, with split royal power. All of these posts would be filled for terms of one year, except the Censors, which would be a five-year tenure. No person would be eligible to run for the same office twice in ten years. All age restrictions as then-currently existing for the posts would remain in force. ** Should the state be in extremis, the Senate could appoint a dictator, who would, as in years past, be allowed a six-month term of unlimited imperium and who would appoint a lieutenant in charge of cavalry Magister Equitum who would also function as Praetor. ** Cicero would also leave in place the ten Tribunes of the Plebeians, with their full powers of veto, and would still be sacrosanct. The Tribunes of the People would also be permitted to preside over meetings of the Senate. *** Quintus, later in the dialogue, strongly objected to this, feeling that the Tribunes, as currently constituted, were a destabilizing force in the state, and believed that Cicero should have rolled back their powers to their severely curtailed state under the laws of Sulla. Cicero seems to argue that curtailing the power of the plebeians or giving them a sham representation of a share in government would be even more destabilizing than a potential Tiberius Gracchus or Saturninus could be. To do so, he in effect argues, would create the same Saturninii and Gracchi that Sulla's laws tried to halt. Cicero remarks: \\"I admit there is an element of evil inherent in the office of tribune; but without that evil we would not have the good which was the point of setting it up. 'The plebeian tribunes,' you say, 'have too much power.' Who's arguing with that? But the crude power of the people is much more savage and violent. By having a leader, it is sometimes milder than if it had none.\\" (III:23) (from The Oxford World Classics translation by Niall Rudd) * Should both consuls, or the Dictator, die or otherwise leave office, all other current officials from quaestor on up are removed from office. An interrex would be appointed by the Senate to arrange as soon as practicable new elections. * Popular Assemblies: The People's Assemblies were, by law, to be free of violence, and were also legislative assemblies. In both the Senate and people's assemblies, a magistrate of a higher rank than the one presiding would be able to veto any act. * Voting and Laws Ballots were, due to an epidemic in Cicero's time of vote tampering and bribery, not to be secret, so that they could be immediately examined for voter fraud. There was also a measure of elitism in his proposal as well, however ‚Äî if the people did not know how the upper classes had voted, Cicero thought they would be confused as to which way to vote. ** No laws were to be passed that were meant to target an individual (no doubt, this was in response to the law pushed through by Publius Clodius Pulcher in 58 BC that demanded exile for any magistrate who imposed and executed a death sentence without a vote by the Popular Assemblies ‚Äî a clear reference to Cicero, who had done just that in 63 BC in response to the Catilinarian Conspiracy) ** No magistrate could impose capital punishment or revocation of citizenship without a vote of the Comitia Centuriata ** Bribery or seeking bribes were to be punished severely. ** Laws would be kept in official record form, something that Cicero felt had lapsed. After a discussion and debate between Cicero and Quintus about the Consuls and the voting rights of citizens, the manuscript breaks off.  Provenance of the text  Much like its sister work de re publica, de Legibus exists in fragmentary condition, with no work beyond the first half of Book Three known to survive. The remaining fragments of de Legibus are scattered in three volumes at the Bibliotheek der Rijksuniversiteit in Leiden, Netherlands. Further, issues of legibility and authenticity have been raised among researchers. Vienna Professor M. Zelzer in 1981 argued that the text as it is now known may have been transcribed out of a cursive (as opposed to block- text) copy at some point, incurring possible mistakes from the vagaries of the script. Others (such as translator Niall Rudd) argue that the text was still in rough-draft form at the time of Cicero's murder in December 43 BC, and that it was still to be cleaned up and edited by the author. Much like de re publica, some material was recovered from the writings of others. Two passages were found used in the third- and fourth-century writer Lactantius's Divinae Institutiones (Lactantius also quoted heavily from de re publica), and one further paragraph has been located in Macrobius' Saturnalia.

It is in the parish of Breage and lies off the A394 road between Helston and Penzance.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End Formerly serving the local mining industry, it is now mostly a tourist-orientated area. Geography The beach at Praa Sands Praa Sands is situated in a sheltered indentation within Mount's Bay; it has a long, wide, sandy, south-facing beach that is lapped by comparatively large waves for the area. The beach, which has shallow water and is manned by seasonal lifeguards, attracts surfers and holidaymakers. Adjacent to the beach are traditional retail outlets serving the holidaymaker. Praa Sands lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The western side of Praa Sands beach contains Folly Rocks Site of Special Scientific Interest, which is noted for its geological aspects, including a granite porphyry. History On 1 February 1882 a pumping engine at Sydney Cove (part of Mount's Bay Consols) was fired. In September 1882 it was reported in The Cornishman newspaper that an engine house was nearly complete and the engine was being put in. During World War II, after an air battle against eight German aeroplanes over the Bay of Biscay, a Sunderland flying boat was heavily damaged. The crew returned 800 miles to the Cornish coast, where pilot Colin Walker landed and beached the aircraft at Praa Sands. The local people of Praa Sands took the crew into their houses and gave them medical assistance. Walker received the Distinguished Service Order and several of the other crew members also won medals. On 2 June 2013, a memorial was opened on the green at Praa Sands.

The most frequent combination is that used by the National Gallery of Australia: \\"Eugene von Gu√©rard\\". The artist's birth certificate shows his name as \\"Johann Joseph Eugen von Guerard\\". (17 November 181117 April 1901) was an Austrian-born artist, active in Australia from 1852 until 1882. Known for his finely detailed landscapes in the tradition of the D√ºsseldorf school of painting, he is represented in Australia's major public galleries, and is referred to in the country as Eugene von Guerard. Early life Born in Vienna, Austria, von Guerard toured Italy with his father (a painter of miniatures at the court of Emperor Francis I of Austria) from 1826, and between 1830 and 1832 resided in Rome, where he became involved with a number of German artists. The foremost landscape painter amongst these so-called \\"Deutsch R√∂mer\\" was Johann Anton Koch, but he also met there members of the , a group of young German breakaway artists known as the Nazarenes,Karin Neumann Murphy: \\"Eugen von Guerard and the German arts in Australia 1778 to 1890\\", unpublished thesis, 1996. From 1841 he studied landscape painting in Germany at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf and travelled widely. Von Guerard's personal artistic style was formed by his first teacher, his miniaturist father with whom he travelled throughout Italy. Other influences ascribed to von Guerard are Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin and Salvator Rosa. During his studies at the D√ºsseldorf Academy he absorbed the new criterion for German art promoted by his landscape lecturer Johann Wilhelm Schirmer under the directorship of ex-Nazaren member Wilhelm von Schadow: to present \\"elevated\\" subject matter in the style of a new \\"truthful\\"' realism. The D√ºsseldorf style of painting combined concepts of prevailing trends: Historicism, a lingering Romanticism and a new visually based Realism that required taking observations from nature. Von Guerards Australian landscapes show his sensitive perception of the Australian landscape, whilst his stylistic methodology exemplifies the confluence of various styles derived from his European artistic heritage.

Image courtesy of State Library Victoria In 1852 von Guerard arrived in Victoria, Australia, determined to try his luck on the Victorian goldfields. As a gold- digger he was unsuccessful, but he did produce a large number of intimate studies of goldfields life,\\"I Have Got It\\", 1854, at www.artistsfootsteps.com quite different from the deliberately awe-inspiring landscapes for which he was later to become famous. By the early 1860s von Guerard was recognised as the foremost landscape artist in the colonies, touring Southeast Australia and New Zealand in pursuit of the sublime and the picturesque.Eugene von Gu√©rard: North-east View from the Northern Top of Mount Kosciusko, 1863 at the National Gallery of Australia He is most known for the wilderness paintings produced during this time, which are remarkable for their shadowy lighting and fastidious detail. Indeed, his view of Tower Hill in south-western Victoria was used as a botanical template over a century later when the land, which had been laid waste and polluted by agriculture, was systematically reclaimed, forested with native flora and made a state park. The scientific accuracy of such work has led to a reassessment of von Guerard's approach to wilderness painting, and some historians believe it likely that the landscapist was strongly influenced by the environmental theories of the leading scientist Alexander von Humboldt. Others attribute his 'truthful representation' of nature to the criterion for figure and landscape painting set by the D√ºsseldorf Academy. In 1866 his Valley of the Mitta Mitta was presented to the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne; in 1870 the trustees purchased his Mount Kosciusko. In 2006, the City of Greater Geelong purchased his 1856 painting View of Geelong for A$3.8M. His painting, Yalla-y-Poora, is in the Joseph Brown Collection on display at the National Gallery of Victoria.Yalla- y-Poora at the National Gallery of Victoria In 2018 another painting, Stoneleigh, Beaufort near Ararat, Victoria (1866) was put on permanent display in the Galleries of the State Library of New South Wales.Exhibition Notes Stoneleigh, Beaufort near Ararat, Victoria, 1866, Eugene Von Guerard, DG 231, State Library of New South Wales, retrieved 22 April 2020 Von Guerard's paintings were also purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales including Waterfall, Strath Creek (1862), Sydney Heads (1865) and Milford Sound, New Zealand (1877‚Äì1879) among many others.

It consists of one volume of bound extracts from von Guerard's journal, 18 August 1852 ‚Äì 16 March 1854, with ten original ink illustrations pasted onto leaves at end of volume. Extracts cover his departure from Gravesend England on board the Windermere and the voyage out to Melbourne, his stay at the Eureka and Ballarat goldfields and his departure to Geelong. The translation may have been made by his daughter, Victoria, who was born in Australia and married an Englishman. For a short time, he lived in Daylesford and created several paintings of the area. In 1870 von Guerard was appointed the first Master of the School of Painting at the National Gallery of Victoria, where he was to influence the training of artists for the next 11 years. His reputation, high at the beginning of this period, had faded somewhat towards the end because of his rigid adherence to picturesque subject matter and detailed treatment in the face of the rise of the more intimate Heidelberg School style. Amongst his pupils were Frederick McCubbin and Tom Roberts. Von Guerard retired from his position at the National Gallery School the end of 1881 and departed for Europe in January 1882. In 1891 his wife died. Two years later, he lost his investments in the Australian bank crash and he lived in poverty until his death in Chelsea, London, on 17 April 1901.

Betancourt has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Mariners, and Kansas City Royals. He played in the Cuban National Series for Villa Clara before he defected from Cuba. In 2019, he became the first former MLB player to return to the Cuban national baseball system after defecting from the country. However, he never played a game for Villa Clara in 2019. In Cuba, he is nicknamed \\"Riquimbili\\". Cuban leagues His early career was spent in the Cuban leagues, including Villa Clara of the Serie Nacional. He was considered the fastest second baseman in the Cuban leagues and the star of the Villa Clara team. In the finals against the Industriales in , he got a hit in nearly every at bat, though the Industriales won, 4 games to 0. He left Cuba on a speedboat in December 2003 and ended up in Mexico, where he played for a while before signing with Seattle Mariners scouts Bob Engle and Patrick Guerrero on January 26, 2005. He made his major league debut on July 28, . Professional career =Seattle Mariners (2005‚Äì09)= Betancourt playing for the Seattle Mariners in . Betancourt's initial calling card had been his fielding. In his first few seasons, he had been considered one of the best fielders in the game, combining excellent range, quickness, soft hands, hand-eye coordination, and a strong, accurate throwing arm. He was named one of the top fielders in baseball in a online fan's poll. In 2007, he made many good fielding plays; however, he suffered through spells of throwing wildness that season. Bad throws accounted for most of his 18 errors in the first half of , almost as many as his total of 20. He turned things around and made only 5 errors in the second half of 2007. His defense suffered in , with several fielding metrics calling him one of the worst shortstops in baseball. Betancourt has been a hitter with some gap power who rarely strikes out or walks. He has been criticized for his lack of plate discipline and inability to bunt. In 2006, he walked only 3.0% of the time, the second-worst percentage in Major League Baseball. However, he only struck out 9.7% of the time, one of the top 20 percentages. Betancourt was among the league leaders in batting with runners in scoring position and game-winning RBI in 2007. In a late season game in 2007, former Mariner Mike Blowers referred to Betancourt as being \\"unreal\\" when batting with runners on in close late games-a result at odds with his career statistics. He hit his first grand slam in a 7‚Äì6 win against the Chicago White Sox on August 11, 2007. In 2008, he again walked only 3.0% of the time, the worst percentage in Major League Baseball. His strikeout rate dropped to 7.5%. He also saw the fewest pitches per plate appearance of all major leaguers, 3.15. =Kansas City Royals (2009‚Äì10)= On July 10, 2009, he was acquired by the Kansas City Royals along with a portion of his salary for Minor League pitchers Derrick Saito and Dan Cortes. In 2009, he had the lowest on-base percentage of any starter in the major leagues, at .274, and the lowest slugging percentage in the American League with .351. In 2010, he hit an opening day home run off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander, and went on to finish the season with a career-high 16 home runs. Many of his other statistics, including his batting average, on-base percentage, and fielding percentage, increased slightly from his 2009 numbers. Betancourt during Brewers Spring Training in 2011 =Milwaukee Brewers (2011)= On December 19, 2010, Betancourt was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers along with teammate Zack Greinke and US$2,000,000, reportedly to offset the buyout of Betancourt's club option in 2012, for Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain, Jeremy Jeffress, and Jake Odorizzi. In 2011, he batted .252 with a .271 on-base percentage, and led the NL in sacrifice flies, with 10. He saw the fewest pitches per plate appearance of all major league ballplayers with 512 or more plate appearances, at 3.16. Betancourt hit his first career postseason home run on October 9, 2011 in a 9‚Äì6 win over the St. Louis Cardinals in game one of the NLCS. Despite having the lowest on-base-percentage of any qualifying shortstop in baseball, he started a majority of the games for the Brewers. Against the Padres on May 9, 2011, Betancourt had one of the most acrobatic double plays of the season, as he turned a ball hit up the middle into a running, behind-the-back toss to Rickie Weeks as they turned the double play. Nevertheless, he posted below average defensive marks by a number of advanced metrics.https://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8585&position;=SS#fieldingadvanced =Return to Kansas City (2012)= On December 20, 2011, Betancourt signed a one-year deal to return to Kansas City worth $2 million. He was released by the Royals on August 14, becoming a free agent. He had played in 57 games, starting 51, with a .228 average and .256 OBP. =Philadelphia Phillies (2013)= On January 28, 2013, Betancourt signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies with an invitation to spring training. On March 24, 2013 the Phillies released Betancourt. =Return to Milwaukee (2013)= On March 26, 2013, pending a physical, Betancourt signed a 1-year deal to return to the Milwaukee Brewers. In the first few weeks of the season he was the MLB leader in HR. He played 137 games with .212 AVG, .240 OBP, and .355 SLG. His AVG and OBP were the worst of his career, and his SLG was well below his career average of .388. =Orix Buffaloes= On January 28, 2014 Betancourt signed a 1-year deal with the Orix Buffaloes of Nippon Professional Baseball. On July 22, 2014 he was released from the Orix Buffaloes with an injury. =Mexican League= On April 21, 2015, Betancourt signed with the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican Baseball League. He was released on April 29, 2015. On April 10, 2017, Betancourt signed with the Leones de Yucat√°n. On March 11, 2018, Betancourt was traded to the Guerreros de Oaxaca. Return to Cuba In late March of 2019, it was reported that Betancourt had successfully repatriated and joined the Santa Clara team in the Villa Clara Provincial League. He thus became the first Cuban ex-MLB player to return to the Cuban national baseball system. Betancourt is expected to rejoin Villa Clara for the 2019‚Äì20 Cuban National Series, as he has previously stated a desire to finish his career playing for his hometown team.

It commemorates the state's October 31, 1864 admission to the Union. The first known observance of Nevada Day (originally known as Admission Day) was by the Pacific Coast Pioneer society during the 1870s. The Nevada Legislature established it as a state holiday in 1933. Observance Nevada Day was originally observed on October 31 each year. Since 2000, it is observed on the last Friday in October.Nevada Day History On this holiday all state, county and city government offices are closed, along with most schools and libraries.Nevada Appeal, October 26, 2007: What's closed for Nevada Day holiday Some private businesses, like banks, also closed at their discretion. In Nevada's capital, Carson City, a parade is held through the heart of downtown, as well as a carnival and several other events. In 2000, the Nevada Legislature decided to celebrate the holiday on a Friday, hoping that a three- day weekend would generate more interest. Nevada Day is now observed on the last Friday in October. But most of the big events in Carson City, including the parade, occur on the following Saturday. This was shortly followed by Las Vegas and Henderson adding up to three Nevada Days throughout the year in addition to the actual holiday which are determined by city council vote during the first week of each legislative year. Until 2000, Halloween was observed in Carson City, Douglas County, Lyon County, and Storey County on October 30, so as to not conflict with the holiday. Black Rock Ranger \\"Teksage\\" rides an art car during the Nevada Day parade. Since 2000, Carson City's newspaper, Nevada Appeal, has sponsored a month-long \\"treasure hunt\\" each year in October (except for 2003 and 2004) to celebrate Nevada Day. Beginning on the first Monday, a clue is posted each weekday on a web site set up for the contest which helps narrow down the search area. The clues all have to do with Nevada history so it encourages people to study the state's history in order to find the \\"treasure\\". Upon finding it, the treasure (a small plaque referred to as a \\"medallion\\") can be redeemed for up to $1000. In 2003, 2008, and 2014 the legal holiday for Nevada Day fell on October 31, the actual day of admission. In 2018, the state's first major professional sports team, the National Hockey League‚Äôs Vegas Golden Knights, observed Nevada Day with a matinee game. In popular culture In 2006, Nevada Day, and the Nevada town of Pahrump, were central to the plot in \\"Nevada Day\\", a two-part episode of the Aaron Sorkin television drama Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.

David Crouch, Kathleen Thompson (Brepols Publishers, Belgium, 2011), p. 71 Enguerrand's and Guy's sister was married to William of Talou, son of Richard II, Duke of Normandy.J.M. Lappenberg, A History of England Under the Norman Kings, ed./trans. Benjamin Thorpe (James Wright, Oxford University, 1857), p. 40 William of Talou had built a strong castle at Arques, and from it (in 1053) he defied his nephew the youthful Duke of Normandy.Elisabeth Van Houts, The Normans in Europe (Manchester University Press, Manchester & New York, 2000), p. 68 As \\"family\\", the comital house of Ponthieu supported the rebellion. Duke William put Arques under siege, and then remained mobile with another force in the countryside nearby. He was aware that Normandy was being threatened by the armies of King Henry of France, who wanted to bring his young, former vassal to heel; and that Normandy's erstwhile allies from Ponthieu would also be coming to break the siege of Arques. Young Count Enguerrand led a Ponthievin army into the Talou to relieve Arques, and arrived first, but Duke William successfully ambushed them and Enguerrand was killed (legend says, within sight and sound of the walls of Arques, from which his sister witnessed the demise of her brother). Upon learning of this serious reverse, the vacillating Henry withdrew his forces at once back across the Norman border. William of Talou was compelled to surrender Arques and was banished for life. (Alternatively, the story goes that Henry reinforced Arques, and Duke William lured part of the French army, including Enguerrand and the Ponthievins, away by a feigned flight, then turned on them and won a battle: Henry then withdrew, forcing the surrender of Arques not long after.) With the death of his older brother (who was without male issue or heirs), Guy assumed the comital duties: this is the first mention of Guy in the historical record. In February 1054, Henry was again ready to chastise Duke William: he reentered the duchy with a large army of his own liegemen and an Angevin army led by Count Geoffrey of Anjou. This combined force moved down the Seine toward Rouen, while Henry's brother Eudes \\"led\\" a second army, along with Guy and Count Rainald of Clairmont. The Franco-Ponthievin army was undisciplined, and fragmented out of control to plunder and pillage the countryside around Mortemer. They were attacked suddenly by Normans from Eu and other districts of northeastern Normandy. In the Battle of Mortemer, Guy's younger brother Waleran was mortally wounded, and Guy himself was captured. He spent two years as a prisoner in Normandy, while his uncle, Bishop Guy of Amiens, ruled Ponthieu as regent. Evidently, from this point on, Count Guy was a vassal of Duke William of Normandy. =Harold Godwinson and the Battle of Hastings= scene 7 of the Bayeux Tapestry scene 23 of the Bayeux Tapestry In 1064, Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex, was shipwrecked on the shores of Ponthieu and captured by Count Guy who took him to his castle of Beaurain on the River Canche, as the Bayeux Tapestry relates: hic apprehendit wido Haroldum et duxit em ad Belrem et ibi eum tenuit (\\"Here Guy seized Harold and led him to Beaurain and held him there\\"). Duke William demanded the release of the earl, and Count Guy delivered Harold Godwinson up after being paid a ransom for him. Harold was not released from Normandy until he too had sworn on the Holy Relics to be Duke William's vassal, and to aid him to the throne of England. (This story is pictured prominently in the Bayeux Tapestry where he is called Wido.) In 1066, Harold accepted the crown of England upon the death of Edward the Confessor, thus precipitating the war that resulted in the Norman Conquest. According to a very convincing interpretation of The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio, Hugh, another of Guy's brothers, was a participant in the Battle of Hastings, and had a hand in the slaying of Harold. Guy I had a son, Enguerrand, who must have died before the Carmen was composed (no later than 1068): when the Carmen refers to Hugh, Guy's brother, as \\"the noble heir of Ponthieu\\", we must assume Enguerrand's death as a fact, either at the time of the Conquest, or shortly before. Issue His daughter, Agnes, married Robert of Bell√™me. Their son, William III of Ponthieu, assumed the comital title upon the death of his mother, sometime before 1111. In popular culture Guy was portrayed by Bernard Hepton in the two-part BBC TV play Conquest (1966), part of the series Theatre 625.

Lyda was reared in Burnet County at the edge of the Texas Hill Country in Central Texas. His grandfather was Gideon Paloris Lyda who worked as foreman on Thomas Lyons & Angus Campbell's famous LC Ranch headquartered near Silver City, New Mexico. Separated from his family at age 10 by his mother's death and the foreclosure on the family farm, Lyda worked for various ranches throughout the Texas Hill Country where he could be close to horses, cattle and ranching life. During World War II, Lyda worked for the railroad, but soon became a carpenter with a large El Paso-based general contractor. He worked with his tools on military projects throughout Texas, Utah and Colorado. Returning to Texas between construction jobs, Lyda broke horses, worked as a ranch hand, occasionally competed in saddle bronc riding at small town rodeos and learned the art of making saddles from legendary rodeo producer and businessman, T. C. \\"Buck\\" Steiner of Austin. Lyda married Randa Jean Lyda and moved to Nixon, Texas to manage the Evans Ranch. Times were hard. To support his wife and two young boys, he quit cowboying in 1947 and hired on as a carpenter with Farnsworth & Chambers, a large building contractor with headquarters in Houston. With the support and encouragement of supervisor/mentor H. Alvin Lott, Lyda earned a reputation for being an innovative, cost-conscious project superintendent who could deliver projects on time and under budget. In late 1954, the 31-year-old project superintendent was transferred to San Antonio to build the massive Wilford Hall Hospital project at Lackland Air Force Base. After completing the hospital on time and within budget, he was promoted to Area Superintendent. In 1960, he formed his own construction company, Darragh & Lyda, with Burnet County rancher Steinmetz Darragh. In the mid-1960s, a joint venture between the San Antonio-based company and H. A. Lott Inc. built the Tower of the Americas and most of the major HemisFair '68 structures in San Antonio. The Lyda organization grew to be one of the most successful general contractors in Texas. Such projects as the Alamodome, the expansion of the University of Texas Memorial Stadium, the Hyatt Hill Country Resort Hotel, the San Antonio Convention Center, the Westin La Cantera Resort Hotel and the Fiesta Texas theme park, as well as hospitals, hotels, banks and office buildings, have significantly re-shaped the skylines of major Texas cities. The company and its subsidiaries were ranked among the Top 400 Contractors by Engineering News-Record and was consistently ranked among the Top 3 commercial building contractors based on billings in San Antonio by San Antonio Business Journal. In 2003, Lyda sold Lyda Constructors Inc., the 100% owned subsidiary of Lyda Inc., to Swinerton, Inc. of San Francisco. After the sale, Lyda retired to his beloved La Escalera Ranch, just south of Fort Stockton, Texas. Lyda had owned or traded more than 880,000 acres (3600 km¬≤) of ranch real estate by 1999, including the sprawling Ladder Ranch in southeastern New Mexico which Lyda eventually sold to television mogul Ted Turner and his actress wife Jane Fonda. Lyda died in 2005. Today, sons Gerald D. and Gene Lyda, along with their sister Jo Granberg, manage the 220,000 deeded acre La Escalera Ranch, which spreads across four Texas counties: Reeves, Pecos, Brewster, Archer, and Baylor. La Escalera Ranch has been ranked by Texas Monthly, The Land Report, and Worth (magazine) as one of the largest cattle ranches in the United States. References * Lyda, Gerald.

It is often used as a tracer dye within water to determine the rate and direction of flow and transport. Rhodamine dyes fluoresce and can thus be detected easily and inexpensively with fluorometers. Rhodamine B is used in biology as a staining fluorescent dye, sometimes in combination with auramine O, as the auramine-rhodamine stain to demonstrate acid-fast organisms, notably Mycobacterium. Rhodamine dyes are also used extensively in biotechnology applications such as fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and ELISA. It is also used in rose milk, a popular Indian beverage. Other uses Rhodamine B solution in water Rhodamine B is often mixed with herbicides to show where they have been used. It is also being tested for use as a biomarker in oral rabies vaccines for wildlife, such as raccoons, to identify animals that have eaten a vaccine bait. The rhodamine is incorporated into the animal's whiskers and teeth. Rhodamine B (BV10) is mixed with quinacridone magenta (PR122) to make the bright pink watercolor known as Opera Rose.  Properties  Rhodamine B closed form (A) and open form (B) Rhodamine B can exist in equilibrium between two forms: an \\"open\\"/fluorescent form and a \\"closed\\"/nonfluorescent spirolactam form. The \\"open\\" form dominates in acidic condition while the \\"closed\\" form is colorless in basic condition. The fluorescence intensity of rhodamine B will decrease as temperature increases. The solubility of rhodamine B in water varies by manufacturer, and has been reported as 8 g/l and ~15 g/L, while solubility in alcohol (presumably ethanol) has been reported as 15 g/L. Chlorinated tap water decomposes rhodamine B. Rhodamine B solutions adsorb to plastics and should be kept in glass. Rhodamine B is tunable around 610 nm when used as a laser dye. Its luminescence quantum yield is 0.65 in basic ethanol, 0.49 in ethanol, 1.0, and 0.68 in 94% ethanol. The fluorescence yield is temperature dependent; the compound is fluxional in that its excitability is in thermal equilibrium at room temperature. Synthesis :Rhodamine B synthesis Safety and health In California, rhodamine B is suspected to be carcinogenic and thus products containing it must contain a warning on its label. Cases of economically motivated adulteration, where it has been illegally used to impart a red color to chili powder, have come to the attention of food safety regulators.

Their main territory is from Tsula (Dikhu) Valley in the east to Tsurang (Disai) Valley in the west in Mokokchung district. They were the first Nagas to embrace Christianity and by virtue of this development the Aos availed themselves of the Western education that came along with Christianity. In the process the Aos pioneered among the Nagas in many fields. Christianity first entered into the Ao territory when an American Baptist missionary, Edwin W. Clark, reached an Ao village called Molungkimong in 1872.  Distribution  The total population of Ao Nagas in Nagaland is almost 227,000 according to the 2011 census. Ao Nagas are found in the northern part of Nagaland, mostly in the central Mokokchung District and also a few are found in the adjacent Assam state. =Tzurangkong Range= They lay adjoining the plains of Assam mostly along the valley of Dissai and Jhanzi rivers just before they flow into the plains of Assam. These hillocks are densely covered with bamboos and the climate of the entire range is warm. =Japukong Range= It is the outermost range stretching from north-east to south-west lying to the interior south of Tzurangkong Range. =Jangpetkong Range= This is a parallel range east of the Japukong Range. =Asetkong Range= It is a central range running from east to west but compared to the other ranges, it is the shortest one. This range lies between Melak and Menung rivers, and therefore, it resembles an island. Hence the name Asetkong (Aset meaning Island) =Langpangkong Range= It is the easternmost range skirting along the course of Dikhu River. The river forms a natural boundary line of Mokokchung with Tuensang and Mon districts. This range is spread like a bed and so the name has been aptly given to this range. (Langpang means bed) =Onpangkong Range= It is the southernmost range forming an irregular boundary of the Ao area with that of the Lothas and Semas to the south and with the Sangtams to the east. It is called Ongpangkong as the land is higher and cooler than the other ranges. (Ongpang means higher) Culture =Religion= The traditional Ao religion is animist, holding that spirits, both benevolent and malicious, must be appealed to and placated through ceremony and sacrifice. Among the Ao deities, Lichaba, the creator, is revered most highly. Edwin W. Clark, an American missionary traveled to Nagaland in 1872 with the intention to carry out missionary work in the country. Clark approached his work among the Ao as a civilizing mission, seeking to replace traditional culture and language with that of the West. The first family to covert to Christianity was the \\"Aier\\" family. The youngest family members now are tamjanminla and narochungla. naga_family_records_2010 Since the 19th century, the majority of Ao have converted to Christianity. Many Ao people, however continue to practice traditional animist festivals and rituals removed from their religious contexts.

Pierwsze starcie totalitaryzm√≥w, original title The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939, Krak√≥w 2009, page 186 During the first months of the war, it became the most recognized and popular military organisation fighting against Franco, and it is a symbol of the Spanish anarchist movement and its struggle to create an egalitarian society with elements of individualism and collectivism. The column included people from all over the world. Philosopher Simone Weil fought alongside Buenaventura Durruti in the Durruti Column, and her memories and experiences from the war can be found in her book, √âcrits historiques et politiques. The Durruti Column was militarised in 1937, becoming part of the 26th Division on 28 April. History =Formation= The column was formed in Barcelona where, on 18 July 1936, the anarchists started fighting against General Goded and his armies. The republican government had done nothing to protect the city from the rebellious army under the command of General Franco; Barcelona was left undefended. Fearing attack, the anarchist and communist organisations such as CNT-FAI along with Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores (UGT), the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (\\"Partit Obrer d'Unificaci√≥ Marxista\\", POUM) and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (\\"Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya\\", PSUC) organised themselves into militia units and took weapons from the arsenals with the support of the people responsible for the arsenals, mostly non-commissioned officers. The anarchists, under the command of Buenaventura Durruti, one of the most popular leaders of Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica attacked the Atarazanas/Drassanes barracks.Antony Beevor Walka o Hiszpaniƒô 1936-1939. Pierwsze starcie totalitaryzm√≥w, original title The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939, Krak√≥w 2009, pages 113-115 Later on, the headquarters of the Durruti Column was attacked at Bujaraloz, half way between Barcelona and Madrid. On 20 July 1936, Durruti and other anarchists such as Juan Garc√≠a Oliver and Diego Abad de Santill√°n, participated in a meeting with Lluis Companys, the President of Catalonia. The next day, as the outcome of that meeting, they formed with other leftist organisations The Central Committee of the Antifascist Militias. Despite being in the majority they took only one third of the committee's seats.Antony Beevor Walka o Hiszpaniƒô 1936-1939. Pierwsze starcie totalitaryzm√≥w, original title The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939, Krak√≥w 2009, page 163 The Committee was responsible for supplying and coordination of the actions different militias. After some time, it became dominated by the communists. =Advance= Intending to take Catalonia back from the Francoists, Durruti and his column headed toward Zaragoza, which was controlled by General Emilio Mola. They fought their first battle in Caspe, a city located about 100 kilometers southeast of Zaragoza. There they were joined by a small group of militiamen commanded by Captain Negrete from Guardia Civil.Abel Paz Durruti in the Spanish revolution AK Press 2007, page 482 As Durruti left Barcelona, there were about 2,500 people in the column, and before they got to Zaragoza their number had increased to 6,000. The advance stopped near the city banks because Durruti became convinced by Colonel Villalba, the leader of all the republican forces, that if he reclaimed Zaragoza, he may become isolated from the rest of the fighters. Nowadays it is doubted if that was a good decision since the republican forces were greater in number; however, some state that in the event of open battle a lack of weapons and supplies could have led to total disaster.Jos√© Andr√©s-Gallego, Luis de Llera, Juan Velarde, Nazario Gonz√°lez Espa√±a acutal - La Guerra Civil (1936‚Äì1939), Madrid 1989, pages 175-176 Durruti made his temporary headquarters in Bujaraloz. Waiting for the more convenient moment to attack Zaragoza turned out to be a grave mistake because, in time, Franco's forces became more powerful there and made it impossible to reclaim the city.Abel Paz Durruti in the Spanish revolution AK Press 2007, page 485 The offensive stopped at this point and there was no major battle. Due to the lack of armaments, most of the advances were small and were mostly initiated due to the actions of the column's guerrilla groups. Durruti was concentrating himself on helping the collective. =Death of Durruti= At the beginning of November 1936 Buenaventura Durruti with more than 3,000 people from the column directed themselves to Madrid. At the time the capital of Spain was in grave danger of being overtaken by the fascists and Federica Montseny convinced Durruti to leave Catalonia. His arrival to Madrid strengthened the morale of the inhabitants. He was ordered to defend and then started the offensive at Casa del Campo. Efficient in street battles, the militants had neither enough power nor experience to stand a chance against the disciplined and well-armed army from Morocco. Having suffered huge casualties the Durruti column escaped the battlefield. On 19 November, Durruti was shot and died in a hospital some time later. The origins of the bullet are unknown. Some say it was an action taken by the responsibility of the Soviet special forces, other that it was failure of Durruti's gun. The column was later commanded by Ricardo Sanz in Madrid and by Lucio Ruano on the Aragon Front. Coronel Carlos Romero Gim√©nez had disagreements with the anarchists. He asked for Sanz's dismissalColonel Romero accused Ricardo Sanz of mistreating the soldiers and of taking prostitutes to the trenches and proposed that the Column be dissolved and its men distributed among other units.Salas Larraz√°bal, Ram√≥n. Historia del Ej√©rcito Popular de la Rep√∫blica. Editora Nacional, Madrid (Espa√±a) , p. 784, note 5. In January 1937 the new general delegate of the column Jos√© Manzana allowed the militarisation of the column which then became part of the 26th Division. =After the Durruti Column= Due to the Soviet forces growing in power, the other militias were organized into regular army and the Durruti Column was transformed into the 26th infantry division. After the war many of the fighters were either put in prison or executed. Those who survived and escaped to France which right before the World War II experienced rise of nationalist sentiments, were put into concentration camps. After the German invasion of France many of the former anarchist fighters played an important part in the French Resistance. Some managed to escape to different countries of Latin America and stayed there for the rest of their lives, sometimes even organising with the indigenous people mini-anarchist states in the jungle, as did Antonio Garc√≠a Bar√≥n.BBC, 8 July 2008, Meeting Spain's last anarchist After the end of the World War II the former republican fighters experienced a huge disappointment. They hoped that the democratic countries would now liberate Spain from Franco's dictatorship. But even Mexico which was one of the most active helpers of the republicans and France after so much help refused to start fighting the dictator. Some of the anarchists, many of them former members of the Durruti Column, decided to organise their own resistance. They had their headquarters in France, many times collaborated with later formed ETA and did not stop fighting until the end of the regime.for the history of the anarchist resistance movement see: Tomasz Sajewicz Zapomniana wojna.

Even though the column did not stop to liberate as many areas as other columns, due to its size, it created the majority of the libertarian communes. At the beginning there were some acts of violence and some people were forced to join the collectives. But it is said that Durruti himself defended the individualists who did not want to work share their land.Gabriel Jackson \\"Breve historia de la guerra civil de Espa√±a\\", original title A Concise History of the Spanish Civil War, 1974 Ruedo ib√©rico) Such people were left having as much land as they could cultivate with their families without any hired labour and could always join the collective. Depending on the place, the individualists could have been put under more or less stronger economical pressure to make them join the commune.  Organization  The simplest combat units were made up of roughly ten to twenty-five individuals who formed a \\"group\\", with a group delegate elected by direct democracy and subject to recall at all times. Groups federated together to form a \\"century\\" of about 100 individuals, which also elected its own delegate. Five centuries formed a \\"grouping\\" with their corresponding elected delegate. The sum of the existing groupings gave rise to the column. Its general delegate, liaising with the War Committee, was the French artillery captain named Berthomieu, who died on October 16 during the Battle of Perdiguera. It also made use of \\"Guerrilla Groups\\", such as 'The Children of the Night', 'The Black Band', 'The Dynamiters' and 'The Metalworkers', which went on missions behind enemy lines. The Durruti Column is said to be the first anarchist military formation with discipline based on solidarity, not on privileges and hierarchy. All the delegates of all ranks lacked privileges and hierarchical command, the column only obeyed orders to attack certain places.Barbara Gola, Franciszek Ryszka Hiszpania Warszawa 1999, page 203 =International Group= The column also had an international group, containing fighters from several countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Morocco, Britain and the United States. Several centuries contained foreigners: * The S√©bastien Faure century, composed of French and Italians, * The Erich M√ºhsam century, composed of Germans, * The Sacco and Vanzetti century.Antony Beevor (amongst others) describes the Sacco and Vanzetti centuria as composed of Americans, but Kenyon Zimmer has found this particular assertion to be false: Kenyon Zimmer, 'The Other Volunteers: American Anarchists and the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939', Journal for the Study of Radicalism, x, no. 2 (Fall 2016), 30, 47. The group grew to approximately 400 fighters, and functioned as an autonomous group within the column command structure. Although used primarily as a shock battalion, the group occasionally performed guerrilla operations. The column was almost wiped out in October 1936 after an offensive around the town of Alcubierre, 50 kilometres northeast of Zaragoza. All but two of the group (at that time numbering around 40) were killed, including the group leader, Frenchman Louis Berthomieu. New members continued to join, however, and the group fought at Madrid in November 1936, with many members continuing to serve in the 26th Division after the militarisation of the column.Paz, Durruti in the Spanish Revolution, 486-8, 550-1; Matt White, ‚ÄòIn November We Remember: IWW members who fought in the Spanish Civil War‚Äô in Industrial Worker, cx, no. 9 (November 2013), 9; Dieter Nelles, ‚ÄòThe Foreign Legion of the revolution: German anarcho-syndicalist and volunteers in anarchist militias during the Spanish civil war‚Äô https://libcom.org/library/the-foreign-legion-revolution Libcom.org accessed 30 October 2014. =Military Technical Council= The 'Military-Technical Council' was made up of all of the delegates in the Column, its delegate was initially Enric P√©rez i Farr√†s but he was quickly replaced by Jos√© Manzana. ; First sector.

A part of the Federal Way School District, it was founded in 1971 in Federal Way, Washington.The graduating classes of 1973-1976 were schooled in the Illahee Middle School building. The school was built in 1976, renovated in 1987, then again remodeled in 2002. Although sometimes assumed to have been named after Commodore Stephen Decatur, a War of 1812 and the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War naval hero, the school is in fact named after the USS Decatur, a ship named for Stephen Decatur that assisted settlers during the 1856 Battle of Seattle. Decatur was originally built as an \\"open concept\\" high school, where students were encouraged to study at their own pace in an open environment. Within the framework of this concept, there were few permanent walls built in the school's original structure. However, this experimental approach was scrapped after the 1976-77 school year when it was discovered that not all high school students were self-motivated enough to meet the district's education standards. Student life Approximately 1,650 students attend the school.

The musical, with book by Abram S. Ginnes and music and lyrics by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans, choreographer Onna White, assistant choreographer Eugene Louis Faccuito (Luigi), opened on Broadway in New York City at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on October 12, 1961, and played 69 performances including one preview. The original Broadway production co-starred George Gobel and Sam Levene and featured Barbara Nichols and Paula Stewart. Erwin Trowbridge, a mild-mannered man working for a greeting card company, has an unusual talent: he can pick the winners of horse races with uncanny accuracy, as long as he does not place a bet himself. When a few professional gamblers discover his talent, they do their best to exploit it. Sam Levene created the role of Patsy in the original Broadway production of Three Men on a Horse (1935) which was a mega-hit in 1935, running an extraordinary 835 performances; three decades later, Levene recreated the role of Patsy in the original Broadway musical Let It Ride. Levene also recreated the role of Patsy in the 1936 Warner Bros. film Three Men on a Horse and a ten-month 1944 USO tour of Three Men on a Horse which played 200 shows to 120,000 servicemen, the first legitimate theatrical production mounted overseas. Levene performed the title song from Let It Ride on a racetrack grandstand parade float accompanied with a bevy of showgirls in the 1961 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade presented on NBC, November 23, 1961. Two songs from Let It Ride are included on the compilation album Lost Broadway 1961 from Stage Door Records; George Gobel as Erwin sings Hey, Jimmy, Joe, John, Jim, Jack and Sam Levene as Patsy leads the company singing the title song Let It Ride.

She is the mother of Jonah Goldberg. Early life and education She was born Lucianne Steinberger in Boston, Massachusetts, to Dr. Raymond Leonard and Lucy Jane (Moseley) von Steinberger. She grew up in Alexandria, Virginia, outside of Washington, D.C., where her father was employed as a government physicist, and her mother was a physiotherapist. She attended high school in Alexandria, leaving at age 16 to begin working. She married her high school sweetheart, William Cummings; the couple separated after three years of marriage and later divorced. Early career Goldberg started her literary career at a very early age at The Washington Post, during her secondary education. Goldberg decided to seek the opportunity as a press aide in Lyndon Johnson's unsuccessful 1960 campaign for president. After John F. Kennedy won the Democratic nomination, she got a position at the Democratic National Committee followed by a spot on Kennedy's Inaugural Committee. She has said she served on Kennedy's White House staff, but according to the Washington Post, her name does not appear on any staff records. In response, she explained that she worked in the Old Executive Office Building doing opposition research, then worked out of the National Press Building in public relations. Public relations firm In 1963, she opened up her own, one-person public relations firm, Lucianne Cummings & Associates. She received national media attention in 1965 when she attempted to sell a handwritten note from Jackie Kennedy to Lady Bird Johnson through an auction house for $1000 ($ in today's dollars). She had come into possession of the note when acting as a messenger for Kennedy in 1960. Upon hearing of the auction, the First Lady became irate, and demanded that the note be returned to the White House. Cummings apologized and returned the note, then found out the next day that her income tax returns were going to be audited by the Internal Revenue Service. In 1966, she married Sidney Goldberg, who was then the executive editor of the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA), later acquired by United Features Syndicate. She took the name Goldberg upon her marriage and worked for the Women's News Service, also a subsidiary of United Features Syndicate. =Conservative activism and Watergate era= In 1970, Goldberg and her friend Jeannie Sakol founded an organization called the \\"Pussycat League\\" to oppose the women's liberation movement, and in 1971 she and Sakol published Purr Baby Purr, a critique of feminism. During the 1972 presidential campaign, she joined the press corps covering Democratic candidate George McGovern claiming to be a reporter for the Women's News Service, though she was on leave of absence from that position. In fact Goldberg was being paid $1000 a week ‚Äì $ in today's dollars ‚Äì to spy on McGovern and those traveling with him on the campaign's planes. When recruited, she was told U.S. President Nixon himself had approved the spying, which was to include traditional political intelligence and information on personal habits: \\"'They were looking for really dirty stuff,' [she] said. 'Who was sleeping with whom, what the secret service men were doing with the stewardesses, who was smoking pot on the plane ‚Äì that sort of thing. I was told to send it all along.'\\" Goldberg's role as a reporter-spy came to light in the Watergate hearings that led to the resignation of Nixon. Feminist Betty Friedan alleged in June 1973 that Goldberg, as an organizer of the Pussycat League, had been attempting to derail the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment by engaging in Watergate-style \\"dirty tricks\\" and by touring the country falsely telling women they would lose their husbands and rights to family support if the amendment was passed. =Literary agent and author= Goldberg ultimately set up her own literary agency and became known as a promoter of \\"right-wing, tell-all attack books\\", according to The New York Times. One of her clients, celebrity biographer Kitty Kelley, sued her in 1983 over proceeds from foreign sales of Kelley's unauthorized biography on Elizabeth Taylor. Kelley ultimately won a judgment of $40,000, with the judge declaring that Goldberg was only guilty of \\"sloppy bookkeeping\\". Goldberg was also the U.S. agent for the memoirs of Prince Charles' former valet, which were blocked for publication in England by Queen Elizabeth. In the early 1990s Goldberg promoted a conspiracy theory book about the suicide death of Clinton White House aide, Vincent Foster, and several books dealing with Clinton's purported sexual infidelities including one by Arkansas State Troopers who alleged they had procured women to have sex with then-Governor Bill Clinton. None of the Clinton-themed books were ever published. Goldberg was also the agent for former detective Mark Fuhrman's bestselling account of the O.J. Simpson trial, Murder in Brentwood. Goldberg has written several novels. Friends in High Places co-written with Sondra Robinson, was published in 1979. Her first solo novel Madame Cleo's Girls, a story of three high-priced call girls, was published in 1992, followed by People Will Talk in 1994. She has also ghostwritten for celebrities; the romance novel Washington Wives (1987) (penned under the name of Maureen Dean, wife of Watergate figure John Dean) is one of her behind-the-scenes works. Monica Lewinsky scandal =The Tripp tapes= Goldberg met Linda Tripp in 1993 or 1994 while working on the proposal for the book on the death of Clinton aide Vince Foster. The two women became friends, and in 1997 Goldberg advised Tripp to secretly record former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, talking about her sexual relationship with President Bill Clinton. Goldberg advised Tripp that it was legal to record phone conversations in Maryland without the consent of the other party; in fact it was illegal to do so. Goldberg urged Tripp to take the resulting 20 hours of tapes to Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr who had a broad mandate to investigate improprieties by Clinton. Goldberg also brought the tapes to the attention of lawyers working on the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against Clinton. The tapes became crucial to Starr's investigation on whether Clinton committed perjury during a sworn deposition when he denied his affair with Lewinsky, which led to his impeachment by the House and acquittal by the Senate. Soon after the secret taping began in the fall of 1997, Goldberg arranged for Tripp to speak with Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff, who had been investigating other allegations about Clinton's sex life. After the scandal became public in January 1998, Goldberg was interviewed frequently by the media. She declared that the tapes proved that Lewinsky and Clinton had had a sexual relationship, and previewed other highlights of the Clinton‚ÄìLewinsky affair such as the existence of a semen-stained dress which later proved to have Clinton's DNA. The Washington Post called her \\"the producer and publicist\\" who set the stage for the scandal and the investigation, she called herself the \\"facilitator\\". Of Goldberg's role in the scandal, Time magazine said; \\"At a minimum, she is forever sealed in history as the New York City literary agent who uttered to her friend the most ruinous sentence of the Clinton presidency: 'Linda, buy a tape recorder.'\\" Author Jeffrey Toobin named her as one of the seven \\"Key Players\\" in the impeachment. Goldberg said her actions in helping to disclose the Lewinsky‚ÄìClinton affair were motivated by her sense that general morality had declined, and that America needed \\"a wake-up call\\". She also said that the disclosure of Lewinsky's affair with Clinton helped to protect Lewinsky, who suffered from an obsessive infatuation with Clinton. During this time, Goldberg made no secret of her personal animus toward Clinton, saying she was glad Clinton was getting caught \\"at something\\", and that \\"[i]f it took this to get him, fine.\\" She also said she was a political independent, though she was described in the press as having long standing ties to the Republican Party. =Repercussions= In the aftermath of the disclosures about the Clinton‚ÄìLewinsky affair, Goldberg was subjected to media attacks on her character and past business dealings. The Democratic National Committee faxed an unflattering \\"information sheet\\" on Goldberg to reporters within days after the story broke. Goldberg admitted that slurs on her own character were to be expected, '\\"I have never thought of myself as a victim in all this,\\" she [said]. '\\"Never. Let them take their best shot.\\"' She later said she had been worn down by the scrutiny. Goldberg denied allegations made in the media that she was part of a vast right wing conspiracy to bring down the presidency of Bill Clinton. When Jeffrey Toobin published his 1999 book, A Vast Conspiracy, that also alleged Goldberg had told friends that she had an affair with Lyndon Johnson, and a Washington Post writer claimed he and others had overheard Goldberg bragging about an affair with Vice President Hubert Humphrey as well, Goldberg threatened Toobin and Random House with a libel suit, denied both affairs, and denied telling any such stories. Goldberg was subpoenaed to testify before a Maryland grand jury that was contemplating indicting Tripp for having made the recordings. Under Maryland law, knowledge that such recordings were illegal was a necessary element of the crime. Goldberg explained that she had given Tripp incorrect advice, telling her it was legal to make secret recordings. Charges against Tripp were later dropped. Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore later set up a webcam focused on the windows of Goldberg's Manhattan apartment, that he called \\"I See Lucy Cam\\". Moore's project did not violate New York State's laws. Claiming that Goldberg did not respect the privacy rights of other people, Moore wrote, \\"\`[s]he believes in keeping an eye on persons who are a threat to the country. So do we.'\\" Later career Goldberg was a prominent presence on the conservative website, Free Republic in the late 1990s, posting under the name \\"Trixie\\". She and other conservatives, including Matt Drudge, left the site when the webmaster, in Goldberg's words, \\"let all the Y2K, gun-nut, Jew-baiting crazies take over [the forum] and flame the plain-old conservatives. She then founded her own website, \\"Lucianne.com\\", and for a time, was a nationally syndicated talk radio host whose show featured a Washington correspondent. Goldberg will be portrayed by Margo Martindale in season three of American Crime Story; \\"Impeachment\\".https://deadline.com/2019/11/margo-martindale-play-lucianne- goldberg-impeachment-american-crime-story-1202792574/ Personal life Lucianne was married to Sidney Goldberg, a wealthy Jewish newspaper executive with United Features Syndicate from 1966 until his death in 2005. The couple had two children. Joshua (1967‚Äì2011) was the editor of her websites, and was the 2009 Republican nominee for the New York City Council seat representing district number six on Manhattan's Upper West Side. He lost the election to the now Manhattan Borough President, Gale Brewer. Jonah (b. 1969) is a best selling author and conservative political commentator. The children were raised in their father's Jewish faith, while Lucianne, who was raised an Episcopalian, remained a Christian.

She was Emperor Ling's first wife, and later became a victim of the powerful eunuchs.  Family background and marriage to Emperor Ling  The later Empress Song was born into a clan that was honoured, but not particularly powerful, during the Eastern Han dynasty. Her father Song Feng (ÂÆãÈÖÜ) was a grandnephew of Consort Song, the imperial consort of Emperor Zhang who gave birth to his first crown prince Liu Qing. During the early reign of Emperor Ling, Song Feng served as the commander of the capital (Luoyang) defence forces. Her aunt was the consort of Liu Kui (ÂäâÊÇù), the Prince of Bohai (ÂãÉÊµ∑Áéã), a brother of Emperor Ling's predecessor Emperor Huan. In 170, Lady Song was selected to be an imperial consort with the rank of guiren. In 171, even though she was not a favoured consort, she was created empress, perhaps because of her noble lineage. Song Feng was created a marquis.  The Liu Kui incident, fall and death  However, even after becoming empress, Empress Song never had Emperor Ling's favour. This, combined with her weak personality, emboldened the concubines who wanted to replace her; these concubines then often defamed her. What proved to be more damaging to her was the \\"Liu Kui incident\\". In 165, Liu Kui had been demoted due to treason; he then approached powerful eunuch Wang Fu (ÁéãÁî´) and promised him a large sum of money if Wang Fu could persuade Emperor Huan to restore his title. In 167, Emperor Huan's posthumous edict restored Liu Kui to the title of Prince of Bohai. However, Liu Kui did not fulfill his promise. In return, Wang Fu falsely accused Liu Kui of treason in 172; Liu Kui was forced to commit suicide, and his entire household was executed. Thereafter, Wang Fu and his confederates became constantly concerned that if Empress Song became powerful, she would avenge her aunt, who was Liu Kui's consort. They therefore joined with the concubines to falsely accuse her of using witchcraft against Emperor Ling. In 178, Emperor Ling finally believed them and deposed Empress Song. Empress Song was imprisoned and died in despair. Her father Song Feng and her brothers were all executed. Song Qi (ÂÆãÂ•á), formally the Marquis of Yinqiang (ÈöêÂº∫‰æØ), who was also executed, was probably a brother of the empress; and as his wife was a younger cousin of Cao Cao, Cao Cao was dismissed from his post as the Prefect of Dunqiu. Some of the eunuchs not involved in the plot who took pity on the late empress gathered her body and those of her family members and gave them proper burials, but as commoners.

Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1963, , pp. 325, 334, 336 Receiving intelligence from captured rebels there, and with his army on one quarter rations, Steele conducted a successful feint operation toward the rebel capital at Washington, Arkansas, and left Thayer's division on the prairie, while he moved his main column eastward to Camden, believing that it contained stockpiles of provisions and forage for his horses. Upon entering Camden after brushing aside light opposition on April 15, Steele discovered that the enemy had destroyed most of the provisions and supplies there. But he also discovered messages in the Camden telegraph office carelessly left behind by the fleeing rebels confirming the earlier rumors and intelligence that General Banks had been repulsed at Mansfield Louisiana, and that Banks's army was in retreat down the Red river. Steele made the decision based on this confirmed intelligence, to await provisions en route from Little Rock and to scour the countryside for additional grain and forage, await developments in Louisiana and then decide whether to continue south or return to Little Rock. Price, meanwhile besieged Camden from the west, north and south. One supply train reached Camden from Little Rock by way of Pine Bluff on April 22, temporarily relieving the food crisis in VII Corps. When Steele dispatched the wagons under escort back to Pine Bluff for more provisions on April 23, it was intercepted and ambushed by a task force of 5 rebel cavalry brigades under James Fagan at Marks Mills April 25, where two thirds of the Union 2nd Brigade was taken prisoner. Learning of this disaster, Steele again employed a successful deception to exit from Camden, which operation was effected without detection on the night of April 26‚Äì27. Proceeding due north on the Military road to Little Rock, elements of Marmaduke's division caught up with VII Corps on the ridge above Jenkins Ferry on the Saline River on April 29, but were easily repulsed and kept at bay enabling Steele to install a pontoon bridge over the Saline and establish strong interior defensive works to guard the crossing. By now, rebel Department of the Trans-Mississippi commander E. Kirby Smith had arrived in Arkansas to take command of Price's force in the field. Smith brought with him two divisions of Arkansas and Texas infantry. Fighting at Jenkins Ferry commenced in a downpour the morning of 30 April. Critical mistakes in troop management by both Price and Kirby Smith resulted in the rebel army committing its divisions in a piecemeal fashion, allowing Steele and his subordinates, Brigadier Generals Frederick Salomon and Samuel Rice, to engage and destroy the attacking rebels in turn with light casualties. The Confederates suffered heavily in this defeat; rebel Generals Marmaduke, Mosby Parsons and John Walker were effectively repulsed in three poorly executed rebel assaults. Indeed, Walker was so thoroughly beaten with 2 of his 3 brigade commanders lying dead on the field, that he refused to submit his casualty report out of embarrassment. Through a further deception operation (reported independently after the war by a Union officer of the 77th Ohio and a Confederate sergeant in General Jo Shelby's command) General James Fagan's heretofore mentioned task force of 5 cavalry brigades was mis-directed away from Jenkins Ferry and did not reach there until the fighting ended. Steele took his army back to Little Rock having won the largest engagement west of the Mississippi during the war. In point of fact, Steele sent several messages to Union Army Chief of Staff Henry Halleck, to Sherman and to his Department commander General John Schofield prior to the expedition, warning of a dearth of forage and provisions in southwest Arkansas, and also calling the military competency of political general Nathaniel Banks into question. Steele was finally compelled, against his better judgment, by newly appointed General-in-Chief Ulysses Grant (and Steele's classmate at West Point) to undertake the expedition to cooperate with Banks. Thus, when the intelligence confirmed Bank's failure against Dick Taylor in Louisiana, Steele had already formulated a plan to save the VII Corps. His victory at Elkins Ford, April 4, at Prairie 'Ane April 12, were indeed impressive, but his victory over Sterling Price and E. Kirby Smith at Jenkins ferry April 29‚Äì30, 1864 is considered the greatest defensive victory of the Civil War. Steele led a force of African American soldiers, officially designated the \\"Column from Pensacola\\", in Major General Edward Canby's Army of West Mississippi between February 18, 1865 and May 18, 1865.Eicher, 2001, pp. 507‚Äì508 His troops fought at the battles of Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely. On April 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Steele for appointment to the brevet rank of brigadier general in the regular army, for services in the capture of Little Rock, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 737 On June 30, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Steele for appointment to the brevet rank of major general in the regular army, for the Siege of Vicksburg and services during the war, to rank from March 13, 1865 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 25, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 709 Postbellum career Steele was transferred to Texas in June 1865 and placed in command of United States forces along the Rio Grande. He subsequently commanded the Department of the Columbia, overseeing the Snake War. from December 1865 until November 1867. On July 28, 1866, Steele had been appointed to the permanent grade of colonel of the 20th U.S. Infantry Regiment. Meanwhile, he had been mustered out of the volunteer service on March 1, 1867. In November 1867, Frederick Steele took a leave of absence for health reasons. He died two months later on January 12, 1868, in San Mateo, California from an injury suffered in a fall in a buggy accident caused when he suffered an apoplectic fit. MAJOR GENERAL FREDERICK STEELE, Daily Alta California, Volume 20, Number 6513, 14 January 1868, p.2, from cdnc.ucr.edu accessed September 11, 2014 He was originally buried in Lone Mountain Cemetery in San Francisco. However his remains were moved in 1912 when the city removed all its cemeteries from within the city limits. He is buried in Woodlawn Memorial Park, Colma, California.

The radiation has a frequency of between 50 and 500 kHz and a total power of between about 1 million and 10 million watts. The radiation is absorbed by the ionosphere and therefore can only be measured by satellites positioned at vast heights, such as the Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer (FAST).

He is best known for his band, KC and the Sunshine Band, as a producer of several hits for other artists, and as a pioneer of the disco genre of the 1970s.Randolph Heard, \\"An Interview with KC [Harry Wayne Casey]\\", in Shelton Waldrep, ed., The Seventies: The Age of Glitter in Popular Culture (London: Routledge, 2013), 283-92. Musical career Harry Wayne Casey formed his band in 1973. He was introduced to Richard Finch, who was doing engineering work on records for TK Records. Thus began the Casey-Finch musical collaboration. The initial members were just Casey and Finch. They later added guitarist Jerome Smith (June 18, 1953 - July 28, 2000) and drummer Robert Johnson, both TK studio musicians. The first few songs, \\"Blow Your Whistle\\" (September 1973) and \\"Sound Your Funky Horn\\" (February 1974), were released as singles, and did well enough on the U.S. R&B; chart and overseas that TK wanted a follow-up single and album. However, while working on demos for K.C. & the Sunshine Band the song, \\"Rock Your Baby\\" (George McCrae) was created. The band's \\"Queen of Clubs\\" was a hit in the UK, peaking at No. 7, and they went on tour there in 1975. K.C. and the Sunshine Band became prominent in the United States in 1975 with \\"Get Down Tonight\\" and \\"That's the Way (I Like It).\\" Other Casey-Finch favorites include \\"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty,\\" \\"I'm Your Boogie Man,\\" \\"Keep It Comin' Love\\" and \\"Please Don't Go.\\" \\"Boogie Shoes\\" appeared on the soundtrack album for Saturday Night Fever. He also joined Teri DeSario on her hit \\"Yes, I'm Ready\\" in 1979. Casey also part- wrote \\"I Ain't Lyin'\\" (a UK hit for George McCrae in late 1975). As a result of the soaring popularity of New Wave and Synthpop in the early 1980s, Casey dissolved the Sunshine Band and recorded several pop-oriented solo albums. In January 1981, he survived a serious car accident ‚Äî another car hit his car head-on. He was left partially paralyzed for six months, and had to re-learn how to walk, dance, and play the piano, but by the end of the year he was back in the recording studio. \\"Give It Up\\", was released as a solo hit, shot to Number One in the UK (but his U.S. label, Epic, refused to release it). However, it became a Top 20 hit in the United States (1984) when issued on the independent Meca label. In the mid-1990s, due to the revived interest in the music and fashions of the 1970s, Casey re-formed the Sunshine Band. Personal life Casey was born on January 31, 1951, at the Naval Hospital in Opa-locka, Florida. He grew up in Hialeah and graduated from Hialeah High School.Miami New Times (9 Sept. 1990): https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/the-boogie-man- is-back-6365133 In the 1990s and 2000s he split his time between Miami Lakes, Florida and Durham, North Carolina.https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA- Pilot/issues/1997/vp970828/08280067.htm; and http://calorielab.com/news/2005/06/22/weight-loss-pilgrims-flock-to-durham-nc/ He now lives in Miami Lakes.

SigmaTel became Austin's largest IPO as of 2003 when it became publicly traded on NASDAQ. The company was driven by a talented mix of electrical and computer engineers plus other professionals with semiconductor industry experience in Silicon Hills, the number two IC design region in the United States, after Silicon Valley. SigmaTel (trading symbol SGTL) was acquired by Freescale Semiconductor in 2008 and delisted from NASDAQ. History In 2004, SigmaTel SoCs were found in over 70% of all flash memory based MP3 devices sold in the global market. However, SigmaTel lost its last iPod socket in 2006 when it was not found in the next-generation iPod Shuffle. PortalPlayer was the largest competitor, but were bought by Nvidia after PortalPlayer's chips lost their socket in the iPod. SigmaTel was voted \\"Best Place to Work in Austin 2005\\" by the Austin Chronicle. In July 2005, SigmaTel acquired the rights to different software technologies sold by Digital Networks North America (a subsidiary of D&M; Holdings, and owner of Rio Audio). In July 25, 2006, Integrated Device Technology, Inc. (IDT) announced its acquisition of SigmaTel, Inc.'s AC'97 and High Definition Audio (HD-Audio) PC and Notebook audio codec product lines for approximately $72 million in cash, and the acquisition of SigmaTel's intellectual property and employee teams necessary for continuing existing product roadmap, with expected closure by the end of July. SigmaTel also won a spot in Samsung televisions. Sales of the SGTV5800 TV audio solution, which can be used in analog, digital and hybrid televisions, have been ramping up. SigmaTel later introduced SGTV5900, which is anticipated to supplant the SGTV5800. In mid-2007 SigmaTel introduced portable QVGA 320√ó240 portable video decoder, and support for higher resolutions using WMV and MPEG4 followed. Some SigmaTel microcontrollers, like STDC982G, are used in printers manufactured by Samsung and sold under the Xerox brand. Kodak all-in-one printers also use SigmaTel IC's. SigmaTel's equity traded as low as $100 million below book value. Its peak share price was $45 and its day one IPO max share price was around $18. After the SGTL IPO in 2003, Austin's other biggest IPO was the later spinoff of Freescale Semiconductor by Motorola Corporation. Over 150 models of MP3/WMA players used SigmaTel SDK3.1 and the STMP35xx SoC with its MS DRM10 capabilities. On February 4, 2008, Freescale Semiconductor announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SigmaTel for $110 million.Freescale Enters Into Definitive Agreement to Acquire SigmaTel ‚Äì Freescale Press Release The agreement closed in the second quarter of 2008 and all SGTL shares were purchased by Freescale for $3 each. Freescale continued developing and selling the STMP3 portable AV SoC product line, which are ARM9-based STMP37xx and STMP36xx AV SoCs, and the DSP56k-based STMP35xx portable AV SoC. Product info was on Freescale's ARM-based controller site. Freescale's i.MX2 ARM9 and i.MX3 ARM11-based multimedia SoC product line (especially analog SoC features) have been integrated with the STMP3xxx product line, resulting in a stronger portable multimedia product portfolio. On February 25, 2009, Freescale laid off 70% of the former SigmaTel team as part of a company-wide reduction in force. No new products under the SigmaTel design teams will be created. A 'skeleton crew' was chosen to stay and support existing OEM customers that are using the existing chips until the chips enter their 'End Of Life' phase. Freescale integrated analog IP from SigmaTel into its competing product lines and continues to pursue component and Real Time OS device driver-based support for OEM's rather than the complete hardware and software turnkey system design approach of the successful SigmaTel startup that powered hundreds of millions of portable media players enjoyed by many users. After winning MP3 player integrated circuit patent infringement suits at the U.S. International Trade Commission when the STMP35xx principal firmware engineer documented how SigmaTel firmware uses its dynamic voltage and frequency scaling related patents, U.S. customs physically destroyed Actions Semiconductor products at the U.S. border for intellectual property infringement. SigmaTel settled all patent litigation and in 2007 entered into a cross-licensing agreement with the Zhuhai, China-based Actions Semiconductor Co. Ltd. Both companies also agreed not to pursue possible third-party IP infringements or new legal action against each other and their respective customers for three years. Consequently, all of Actions' current and future products may be imported into the U.S. market without restrictions.Actions and SigmaTel Settle All Patent Litigation and Enter into Cross-License Agreement: Financial News ‚Äì Yahoo! 20 June 2007 Products SigmaTel offered a line of efficient audio and video codec chips that were integrated into many desktop computers, notebooks, and audio playback devices, notably MP3/WMA players. Other products included microcontrollers for digital appliances, portable compressed video decoders and TV audio products. The line of popular audio chips included portable STMP35xx, STMP36xx, and AV capable STMP37xx SoC. A key technology was the advanced device driver support of a broad array of multi vendor raw NAND flash memory used for program storage and virtual memory in lieu of discrete RAM, AV file storage, and new audio recordings. The STMP35xx SoC was sold into over 150 million portable media players. Former IBM engineer Dave Baker, Ph.D. EE UTexas Austin, and Texas Instruments alum EE MBA Danny Mulligan led the SoC design team at SigmaTel. Pre-IPO engineer, UTexas Austin Electrical and Computer Engineering alum and Motorola Advanced Media Platforms alum Jonathan L. Nesbitt was STMP35xx SoC Software Development Kit principal lead from 2006 to 2009. Several major contributing principal embedded software engineers from the pre-IPO period included Thor Thayer, ex-Motorolan Jeff Gleason on audio DSP, UT Austin alum Marc Jordan on boot ROM and USB, J.C. Pina, MIT's physicists Gray Abbott and William (Bill) Gordon Ph.D. Others principals formerly with the Motorola Advanced Media Platforms division that later become Freescale's multimedia group included Matt Henson of Carnegie Mellon U and Janna Garafolo. Former Motorolan EE Tom Zudock served as VP of software and managed the software team for the STMP35xx and STMP36xx SDK. Other leading technologists that created this Texas based System On a Chip success are members of the LinkedIn group SigmaTel Alumni. Several IC fabs in Asia were utilized to build SoC wafers including TSMC in Taiwan. Audio encoding and recording to a wide variety of flash memory in MP3 and WAV formats were supported from microphone, SigmaTel FM IC (STFM1000) digital audio source, or line-in. Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layouts and reference schematics were provided to OEM and Original Development Manufacturing (ODM) customers, driving easy manufacturing. Turnkey portable media player custom RTOS, framework, and app software was a large component of the company's success. SigmaTel provided SoC software to equipment manufacturers of portable audio and video player chips. SigmaTel's audio chips have been found in Dell laptops, several Dell desktops, the Sony Vaio notebook, and numerous other audio playback devices. STMP35xx is an audio System-on-a-Chip (SoC) that requires no external RAM, voltage converters, battery chargers, headphone capacitors, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, or amplifiers. Over 150 portable audio product models are based on that STMP35xx SDK3 and over 150 million such portable audio player SoCs were sold from 2002-2006. The first-generation iPod Shuffle used the SigmaTel STMP35xx and its product quality Software Development Kit v2.6. Other products using that SigmaTel SoC and software include the Dell Ditty, Creative MuVo, Philips, and many others. Audio quality for the chip was rated as best in industry. SDK3.1x added Microsoft DRM10 support, enabling interoperability with services such as Rhapsody million song subscription service, Napster, and Yahoo! Music Engine.

Oil exudes from joint cracks in the petroliferous shale forming the floor of mine. 1906 photo, U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 321 Tar bubble at La Brea Tar Pits, California A petroleum seep is a place where natural liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons escape to the earth's atmosphere and surface, normally under low pressure or flow. Seeps generally occur above either terrestrial or offshore petroleum accumulation structures. The hydrocarbons may escape along geological layers, or across them through fractures and fissures in the rock, or directly from an outcrop of oil-bearing rock. Petroleum seeps are quite common in many areas of the world, and have been exploited by mankind since paleolithic times. Natural products associated with these seeps include bitumen, pitch, asphalt and tar. In locations where seeps of natural gas are sufficiently large, natural \\"eternal flames\\" often persist. The occurrence of surface petroleum was often included in location names that developed; these locations are also associated with early oil and gas exploitation as well as scientific and technological developments, which have grown into the petroleum industry. History of petroleum seep exploitation =Prehistory= The exploitation of bituminous rocks and natural seep deposits dates back to paleolithic times. The earliest known use of bitumen (natural asphalt) was by Neanderthals some 70,000 years ago, with bitumen adhered to ancient tools found at Neanderthal sites in Syria. =Ancient civilizations= After the arrival of Homo sapiens, humans used bitumen for construction of buildings and waterproofing of reed boats, among other uses. The use of bitumen for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth millennium BCE in the early Indus community of Mehrgarh where it was used to line the baskets in which they gathered crops.McIntosh, Jane. The Ancient Indus Valley. p. 57 The material was also used as early as the third millennium BCE in statuary, mortaring brick walls, waterproofing baths and drains, in stair treads, and for shipbuilding. According to Herodotus, more than four thousand years ago natural asphalt was employed in the construction of the walls and towers of Babylon, great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river Issus, one of the tributaries of the Euphrates, and this fact confirmed by Diodorus Siculus. Herodotus mentioned pitch spring on Zacynthus (Ionian islands, Greece). Also, Herodotus described a well for bitumen and oil near Ardericca in Cessia. In ancient times, bitumen was primarily a Mesopotamian commodity used by the Sumerians and Babylonians, although it was also found in the Levant and Persia. Along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the area was littered with hundreds of pure bitumen seepages. The Mesopotamians used the bitumen for waterproofing boats and buildings. Ancient Persian tablets indicate the medicinal and lighting uses of petroleum in the upper levels of their society. In ancient Egypt, the use of bitumen was important in creating Egyptian mummies ‚Äî in fact, the word mummy is derived from the Arab word m≈´miyyah, which means bitumen. Oil from seeps was exploited in the Roman province of Dacia, now in Romania, where it was called picula. In East Asia these locations were known in China, where the earliest known drilled oil wells date to 347 CE or earlier. The ancient records of China and Japan are said to contain many allusions to the use of natural gas for lighting and heating. Petroleum was known as burning water in Japan in the 7th century. In his book Dream Pool Essays written in 1088, the polymathic scientist and statesman Shen Kuo of the Song Dynasty coined the word Áü≥Ê≤π (Sh√≠y√≥u, literally \\"rock oil\\") for petroleum, which remains the term used in contemporary Chinese. In southwest Asia the first streets of 8th century Baghdad were paved with tar, derived from natural seep fields in the region. In the 9th century, oil fields were exploited in the area around modern Baku, Azerbaijan. These fields were described by the Arab geographer Abu al-Hasan 'Alƒ´ al-Mas'≈´dƒ´ in the 10th century, and by Marco Polo in the 13th century, who described the output of those wells as hundreds of shiploads. Distillation of petroleum was described by the Persian alchemist, Muhammad ibn Zakarƒ´ya RƒÅzi (Rhazes). There was production of chemicals such as kerosene in the alembic (al-ambiq),Ajram (1992), p. ?. which was mainly used for kerosene lamps.Zayn Bilkadi (University of California, Berkeley), \\"The Oil Weapons\\", Saudi Aramco World, January‚ÄìFebruary 1995, pp. 20-7 Arab and Persian chemists also distilled crude oil in order to produce flammable products for military purposes. Through Islamic Spain, distillation became available in Western Europe by the 12th century. It has also been present in Romania since the 13th century, being recorded as pƒÉcurƒÉ.Istoria Romaniei, Vol II, p. 300, 1960 =Eighteenth century Europe= In Europe, petroleum seeps were extensively mined near the Alsace city of Pechelbronn, where the vapor separation process was in use in 1742. In Switzerland c. 1710, the Russian-born Swiss physician and Greek teacher Eyrini d'Eyrinis discovered asphaltum at Val-de-Travers, (Neuch√¢tel). He established a bitumen mine de la Presta there in 1719 that operated until 1986.Le bitume et la mine de la Presta (Suisse), Jacques Lapaire, Mineraux et Fossiles No 315 \\"Asphaltum\\" Stoddart's Encyclopaedia Americana (1883) pages 344‚Äì345Eirinis' paper, entitled \\"Dissertation sur la mine d'asphalte contenant la mani√®re dont se doivent r√©gler Messieurs les associ√©s pour son exploitation, le profit du Roy, & celui de la Soci√©t√©, & ce qui sera d√ª √† Mr d'Erinis √† qui elle apartient 'per Ligium feudum' \\" is held at the BPU Neuch√¢tel - Fonds d'√©tude [Ne V] catalogue Oil sands here were mined from 1745 under the direction of Louis Pierre Ancillon de la Sablonni√®re, by special appointment of Louis XV.History of Pechelbronn oil The Pechelbronn oil field was active until 1970, and was the birthplace of companies like Antar and Schlumberger. In 1745 under the Empress Elisabeth of Russia the first oil well and refinery were built in Ukhta by Fiodor Priadunov. Through the process of distillation of the \\"rock oil\\" (petroleum) he received a kerosene-like substance, which was used in oil lamps by Russian churches and monasteries (though households still relied on candles). =Colonial Americas= The earliest mention of petroleum seeps in the Americas occurs in Sir Walter Raleigh's account of the Pitch Lake on Trinidad in 1595. Thirty- seven years later, the account of a visit of a Franciscan, Joseph de la Roche d'Allion, to the oil springs of New York was published in Sagard's Histoire du Canada. In North America, the early European fur traders found Canadian First Nations using bitumen from the vast Athabasca oil sands to waterproof their birch bark canoes. A Swedish scientist, Peter Kalm, in his 1753 work Travels into North America, showed on a map the oil springs of Pennsylvania. In 1769 the Portol√† expedition, a group of Spanish explorers led by Gaspar de Portol√†, made the first written record of the tar pits in California. Father Juan Cresp√≠ wrote, \\"While crossing the basin the scouts reported having seen some geysers of tar issuing from the ground like springs; it boils up molten, and the water runs to one side and the tar to the other. The scouts reported that they had come across many of these springs and had seen large swamps of them, enough, they said, to caulk many vessels. We were not so lucky ourselves as to see these tar geysers, much though we wished it; as it was some distance out of the way we were to take, the Governor [Portola] did not want us to go past them. We christened them Los Volcanes de Brea [the Tar Volcanoes].\\". Modern extraction and industry Natural asphalt with embedded wood, Pitch Lake, Trinidad and Tobago. Asphalt has been produced from Pitch Lake since 1851. During the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, oil seepages in Europe were exploited everywhere with the digging, and later drilling, of wells near to their occurrences and the discovery of numerous small oil fields such as in Italy.van Dijk, J.P., Affinito, V., Atena, R., Caputi, A., Cestari, A., D'Elia, S., Giancipoli, N., Lanzellotti, M., Lazzari, M., Orioli, N., and Picone, S.

It was only after Ignacy ≈Åukasiewicz had improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available \\"rock oil\\" (\\"petr-oleum\\") seeps in 1852 that the first rock oil mine was built near Krosno in central European Galicia (Poland/Ukraine) in 1853. In 1854, Benjamin Silliman, a science professor at Yale University, was the first American to fractionate petroleum by distillation. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world. The world's first commercial oil well was drilled in Poland in 1853, and the second in nearby Romania in 1857. At around the same time the world's first, but small, oil refineries were opened at Jas≈Ço in Poland, with a larger one being opened at Ploie»ôti in Romania shortly after. Romania is the first country in the world to have its crude oil output officially recorded in international statistics, namely 275 tonnes.The History Of Romanian Oil Industry PBS: World Events By the end of the 19th century the Russian Empire, particularly in Azerbaijan, had taken the lead in production., p. 5 The first oil \\"well\\" in North America was in Oil Springs, Ontario, Canada in 1858, dug by James Miller Williams. The US petroleum industry began with Edwin Drake's drilling of a oil well in 1859John Steele Gordon \\"10 Moments That Made American Business\\", American Heritage, February/March 2007. on Oil Creek near Titusville, Pennsylvania, both named for their petroleum seeps. Other sources of oil initially associated with petroleum seeps were discovered in Peru's Zorritos District in 1863, in the Dutch East Indies on Sumatra in 1885, in Persia at Masjed Soleiman in 1908, as well as in Venezuela, Mexico, and the province of Alberta, Canada. By 1910, these too were being developed at an industrial level. Initially these petroleum sources and products were for use in fueling lamps, but with the development of the internal combustion engine, their supply could not meet the increased demand; many of these early traditional sources and \\"local finds\\" were soon outpaced by technology and demand. Petroleum seep formation Tar seep at Rozel Point, on the mud (salt) flats of the Great Salt Lake. Re-worked tar on beach at Rozel Point, Utah. The black rocks are basalt: the tar is brown and looks like cow manure. A petroleum seep occurs as a result of the seal above the reservoir being breached, causing tertiary migration of hydrocarbons towards the surface under the influence of the associated buoyancy force. The seal is breached due to the effects of overpressure adding to the buoyancy force, overcoming the capillary resistance that initially kept the hydrocarbons sealed. =Causes of overpressure= The most common cause of overpressure is the rapid loading of fine-grained sediments preventing water from escaping fast enough to equalise the pressure of the overburden. If burial stops or slows, then excess pressure can equalize at a rate that is dependent on the permeability of the overlying and adjacent rocks. A secondary cause of overpressure is fluid expansion, due to changes in the volume of solid and/or fluid phases. Some examples include: aquathermal pressuring (thermal expansion), clay dehydration reactions (such as anhydrite) and mineral transformation (such as kerogen to oil/gas and excess kerogen). =Types of seeps= There are two types of seep that can occur, depending on the degree of overpressure. Capillary failure can occur in moderate overpressure conditions, resulting in widespread but low intensity seepage until the overpressure equalizes and resealing occurs. In some cases, the moderate overpressure cannot be equalized because the pores in the rock are small so the displacement pressure, the pressure required to break the seal, is very high. If the overpressure continues to increase to the point that it overcomes the rock's minimum stress and its tensile strength before overcoming the displacement pressure, then the rock will fracture, causing local and high intensity seepage until the pressure equalizes and the fractures close. California seeps Diatomite outcrop containing oil that seeps out in hot weather, near McKittrick, in Kern County California. Oil stained outcrop near Kern River oilfield, in Kern County California. Oil Seep in the Simi Valley area of Ventura County, CA California has several hundred naturally occurring seeps, found in 28 counties across the state. Much of the petroleum discovered in California during the 19th century was from observations of seeps.Natural Oil and Gas Seeps in California . The world's largest natural oil seepage is Coal Oil Point in the Santa Barbara Channel, California. Three of the better known tar seep locations in California are McKittrick Tar Pits,McKittrick Tar Seeps. Buena Vista Museum Of Natural History. Carpinteria Tar Pits and the La Brea Tar Pits.La Brea Tar Pits. Page Museum. At Kern River Oil Field, there are no currently active seeps. However, oil-stained formations in the outcrops remain from previously active seeps. Petroleum seeps may be a significant source of pollution. Seeps known as the McKittrick Tar Pits occur in the McKittrick Oil Field in western Kern County. Some of the seeps occur in watersheds that drain toward the San Joaquin Valley floor. These seeps were originally mined for asphalt by Native Americans, and in the 1870s larger scale mining was undertaken by means of both open pits and shafts. In 1893, Southern Pacific Railroad constructed a line to Asphalto, two miles from present day McKittrick. Fuel oil for the railroad was highly desired, especially since there are very few coal-bearing formations in California.McKittrick Oil Field, article by R.L. Hewitt, Trico Oil and Gas Company, in AAPG/SEPM/SEG Guidebook, Joint Annual Meeting, Los Angeles, California, March 1952, Boris Laiming, The Texas Company, Editor. The field is produced now by conventional oil wells, as well as by steam fracturing. The oil seeps at McKittrick are located in diatomite formation that has been thrust faulted over the younger sandstone formations. Similarly, in the Upper Ojai Valley in Ventura County, tar seeps are aligned with east-west faulting. In the same area, Sulphur Mountain is named for the hydrogen sulfide-laden springs. The oil fields in the Sulphur Mountain area date from the 1870s. Production was from tunnels dug into the face of a cliff, and produced by gravity drainage.Piru to Ojai Road Log, by J.W. Sheller, State Exploration Company, in AAPG/SEPM/SEG Guidebook, Joint Annual Meeting, Los Angeles, California, March 1952, Boris Laiming, The Texas Company, Editor. The petroleum fly (Helaeomyia petrolei) is a species of fly that was first described from the La Brea Tar Pits and is found at other California seeps as well. It is highly unusual among insects for its tolerance of crude oil; larvae of this fly live within petroleum seeps where they feed on insects and other arthropods that die after becoming trapped in the oil. Offshore seeps In the Gulf of Mexico, there are more than 600 natural oil seeps that leak between one and five million barrels of oil per year, equivalent to roughly 80,000 to 200,000 tonnes.Oil in the Sea III: Inputs, Fates, and Effects. 2003. When a petroleum seep forms underwater it may form a peculiar type of volcano known as an asphalt volcano. The California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources published a map of offshore oil seeps from Point Aguello (north of Santa Barbara) to Mexico.. California Offshore Oil and Gas Seeps Map In addition, they published a report describing the seeps. The report also discusses the underground blowout at Platform A which caused the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill. It also describes accounts from divers, who describe seepage changes after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. California Offshore Oil and Gas Seeps Report In Utah, there are natural oil seeps at Rozel Point on the Great Salt Lake.Geosights, Spiral Jetty. Utah Geological Survey. The oil seeps at Rozel Point can be seen when the lake level drops below an elevation of approximately ; if the lake level is higher, the seeps are underwater. The seeps can be found by going to the Golden Spike historical site, and from there, following signs for the Spiral Jetty. Both fresh tar seeps and re-worked tar (tar caught by the waves and thrown up on the rocks) are visible at the site. The petroleum seeping at Rozel Point is high in sulfur, but has no hydrogen sulfide.T.F. Yen and G.V. Chiligarian, editors, Asphaltenes and Asphalts, volume 1, Elsevier Science B.V, 1994. Page 302.

It is most commonly used to let photographers to take a photo of themselves (often with family), hence the name. The self-timer is also used to reduce camera shake when taking photographs in low light or with long (telephoto) lenses. The timer's delay gives the photographer time to steady the camera before the shutter fires, and allows vibrations from the mirror flipping up (on SLRs) to die out. It also eliminates any photographer-induced camera motion when the shutter button is pressed. Most modern cameras with a self- timer flash a light during the countdown, emit a beeping sound, or both. These warnings generally increase in speed or intensity during the last few seconds, to warn that the shutter is about to fire. The most common delay is ten seconds. Some cameras also have a two-second setting. A few cameras provide continuously variable delay. Single-lens reflex cameras have to flip up the viewing mirror before the picture is taken, which can also shake the camera. It is not uncommon for a camera to combine mirror lockup with the two-second self-timer mode, which reduces camera shake still further. Alternatives to the self-timer include a cable release, and infrared or radio remote control. On some leaf-shutter cameras, the self-timer mode is selected with the flash-sync lever, and is marked V, for the German word Vorlaufwerk.

Skip Frye in his element 2007. Photo: Bengt Nyman Background Skip attended Mission Bay High School and began his professional surfing career in 1958. His first board was a balsa board shaped by legend Mike Diffenderfer. Skip rode professionally for G&S; surfboards and eventually created his own model for them in 1967. Skip captured national titles and represented the United States team internationally in 1966. Frye has appeared on many magazine covers including Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue (1969, with model Jamee Becker), The Surfer's Journal, Surfing, and Surfer Magazine. Skip is known for his gliding, fluid style as well as some of the most in-demand surfboards in the world. He is perhaps, best recognized by his iconic logo, a set of wings commonly referred to as \\"Frye Wings.\\" After hitting a rough financial patch in the 70s, he started signing his wings in pencil because he could't afford laminates. This is referred to as his \\"ghetto days\\", when he shaped surfboards behind Select Surf Shop in Pacific Beach. Iconic images of him surfing with his dog, silhouetted against a setting sun, and paddling alone into \\"The Ranch\\" have appeared in books and magazines and have been printed on clothing and surfboards.http://www.surfline.com/surfing- a-to-z/skip-frye-biography-and-photos_813/ Skip is also known for his innovation with foiled surfboard fins. After a surfing trip to Australia in 1969, he developed his trademark board shapes: the Egg, the Fish, and specialized longboard shapes. He has developed a moderate temperature surf wax (\\"Man Wax\\"), ideal for his native San Diego waters. Skip still surfs daily and shapes in the San Diego area. His attention to detail and careful hand-shaping practices have created high demand and long wait-lists. His boards have slowly become collector's pieces often passed down through generations. Frye is a 2011 inductee into the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, California in the surf pioneer category. In May, 2017 Frye was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the San Diego Surf Film Festival. Personal Frye married his first wife, Marcia Metcalf in 1963. Together, they raised their three children (Lauren - from a previous marriage, Donald - from a previous marriage, and Braden) before divorcing. Following his divorce, Frye experienced a period of personal struggle but submerged himself in his sport and his faith. In 1990, Frye married his long-time girlfriend, Donna Frye (n√©e Sarvis) and they started Harry's Surf Shop with Harry \\"Hank\\" Warner. His wife was elected as a San Diego City Councilmember in 2001 and narrowly lost the San Diego mayoral election in 2005. Her term ended on December 6, 2010. They founded Surfers Tired of Pollution in the mid 1990s and are both public supporters of clean water and the environment.

This allows brokers and financial companies to hold their securities at one location where they can be available for clearing and settlement. This is usually done electronically, making it much faster and easier than was traditionally the case where physical certificates had to be exchanged after a trade had been completed. In some cases these organizations also carry out centralized comparison, and transaction processing such as clearing and settlement of securities transfers, securities pledges, and securities freezes.  Scope  A CSD can be national or international in nature, and may be for a specific type of security, such as government bonds. =Domestic central securities depository= Many countries have one domestic CSD that was traditionally associated with the national stock exchange. These organizations are typically heavily regulated by the government and may or may not be separate from the exchanges where trading in securities occurs. =International central securities depository (ICSD)= An international CSD is a central securities depository that settles trades in international securities such as eurobonds although many also settle trades in various domestic securities, usually through direct or indirect (through local agents) links to local CSDs. Examples of international CSDs include Clearstream (previously Cedel), Euroclear and SIX SIS. While viewed as a national CSD rather than an ICSD, the US Depository Trust Company (DTC) does hold over $2 trillion in non-US securities and in American depositary receipts from over 100 nations. Functions * Safekeeping Securities may be in dematerialized form, book- entry only form (with one or more \\"global\\" certificates), or in physical form immobilized within the CSD. * Deposit and withdrawal Supporting deposits and withdrawals involves the relationship between the transfer agent and/or issuers and the CSD. It also covers the CSD's role within the underwriting process or listing of new issues in a market. * Dividend, interest, and principal processing, as well as corporate actions including proxy voting Paying and transfer agents, as well as issuers are involved in these processes, depending on the level of services provided by the CSD and its relationship with these entities. * Other services CSDs offer additional services aside from those considered core services. These services include securities lending and borrowing, matching, and repo settlement, or ISIN assistance. * Pledge - Central depositories provide pledging of share and securities.

It is a fin-stabilized, terminally laser guided, explosive shell intended to engage hard point targets such as tanks, self-propelled howitzers or other high-value targets. It may be fired from different artillery pieces, such as the M114, M109, M198, M777 and CAESAR howitzers. The projectile has a minimum range of 3 km and a maximum range of 16 km. Development The concept for Copperhead was originally made in 1970 by engineers at the US Army's Rodman Laboratories, with feasibility studies conducted in 1971. In 1972 development contracts were awarded to Martin Marietta and Texas Instruments. After testing Martin Marietta was chosen for continued development through the 1970s.  Description  At and long, Copperhead is longer and heavier than traditional 155mm ammunition.http://www.ausairpower.net/SP/DT-SPH-0705.pdf The warhead assembly consists of a shaped charge loaded with of Composition B. For Copperhead to function, the target must be illuminated with a laser designator. Once the laser signal is detected, the on-board guidance system will operate the steering vanes to maneuver the projectile to the target. The Copperhead targeting logic is designed to ensure (1) that the optical system will always be able to detect the target, and (2) that once the target has been detected there will be sufficient time and velocity to maneuver to hit the target. Copperhead must be below any cloud cover at critical parts of the trajectory, and there must be sufficient visibility to ensure that when the target is acquired the projectile will have sufficient time to maneuver. Modes of operation Cross section of M712 Copperhead Copperhead has two modes of operation: Ballistic mode and glide mode. Ballistic mode is used where the cloud ceiling is high and visibility is good. When the projectile is 3,000 meters from the target, the guidance vanes extend, the target is acquired, and then the on-board guidance system adjusts the guidance vanes to maneuver onto the target. Glide mode is used when the cloud ceiling and/or the visibility is too low to permit the use of the ballistic mode. A glide mode trajectory consists of two phases: a ballistic phase and a glide phase. At a predetermined point along the trajectory, the guidance vanes extend and there is a transition from ballistic phase to glide phase. Glide phase targeting logic is designed to ensure the largest possible angle of fall permitted by the cloud cover and the visibility. The target is acquired when the projectile is close enough to detect the laser illumination or when the projectile emerges from the cloud cover, whichever event occurs later in the trajectory. When a trajectory solution has been obtained, time-to-target and terminal velocity are checked to ensure that there will be enough time to maneuver and that the projectile is aerodynamically stable‚Äîthat it will not stall while maneuvering. Initially the laser designation was intended to be performed by the MQM-105 Aquila pilotless drone.p.43, Yenne & Yenne Combat history Copperhead was used in Operation Desert Storm, M712 Copperhead - Global Security with 90 rounds fired against hardened Iraqi fortifications and radar stations.

Feigning compliance, Jake attacks Vance and knocks him senseless long enough for him to get to an escape pod and launch into space. However, the cause of the damage on board the Vanguard Explorer is unknown. The German-language VHS introduces the plot: \\"In year 2087. The Earth is dying. They must find a new planet.\\" It is now six years later, in the year 2088. Command cadet Jonathan Hays, twenty-one, and his best friend Jessie 'Beanie' Bienstock, a 14-year-old computer specialist, are among the young military cadets chosen to serve as the crew of Earth*Star Voyager, the planet's newest interstellar vessel. Due to worsening ecological conditions on Earth, there is a plan in place to evacuate the planet and colonize another world. (This mission is noted on the cover of the German VHS: see image at right). Probes have been sent out six years ago via the Vanguard Explorer, and one has sent data back on Berenson's Star; she has a life-zone planet which has been named 'Demeter'. The mission of Earth*Star Voyager is to go to Demeter, perform a full planetary survey and return that information because if conditions on Demeter prove accurate (the probe's data indicates that human life could survive on Demeter), then the human race will colonize the world. The plan to colonize Demeter has already begun; ships are already being built to transport the population but will take forty years to complete construction of all the necessary vessels, and the trip to Demeter, with 'plasma-thrust' engines and the Bauman Drive (named for Professor Bauman, the creator) will take 26 years. That was the rationale of choosing the crew from the Academy‚Äîfor their youth and intelligence. Jonathan, as second-in-command, will assume command if Forbes is shown to be unable to continue his duties due to age. It is also mentioned that a modified form of cryogenic suspension will be used by the crew during the voyage in order to slow the ageing process. (Beanie mentions that he'll be forty years old upon their return to Earth, and Captain Forbes also mentions that, although the process will slow their ageing, they will still age.) Among the crew members are Lani Miyori (a communications specialist) and Luz Sansone, a fellow communications tech who takes an immediate liking to Beanie. Also aboard are Dr. Sally Arthur, a 24-year-old M.D., Huxley Welles, an 18-year-old navigator, and Dr. Leland Eugene, the ship's psychiatrist. The crew arrives aboard the Earth*Star Voyager, and are met by Captain Forbes (the commanding officer), Brody (the ship's resident physical fitness instructor - crew members are required to engage in a physical fitness program), and 'Priscilla', the sentient supercomputer that is the primary logic circuit for the vessel - who has seemingly developed a crush on Huxley. It is mentioned that this was a concern by the programmers; Priscilla is designed from the brain engrams of Priscilla Bauman (the daughter of Professor Bauman), and as such, she has all of memories, thoughts, feelings and desires of the real Priscilla Bauman. This is slightly annoying to Huxley. Adm. Beasley, a war hero who fought back a criminal organization called the Outlaw Technology Zone, gave them a final pep-talk and saw them off from his flagship, the Triton Corsair. Not long after embarking on the mission, the ship has to pass through the junk belt. Immediately entering the belt, the auto-pilot is unable to travel the course plotted because the junk starts to move due to the ship's engines. After the shields and ship take some damage, Jonathan takes manual control and flies the ship through without taking further damage. While checking the repairs on an airlock, Captain Forbes finds himself trapped inside with the system set to open the airlock to space. Moments later, coming to check on the Captain, Jonathan finds him before the airlock opens. Before being blown into space, the Captain tells Jonathan to keep going and to 'complete the mission'. Jonathan orders the ship's psychiatrist to review the crew's profiles for any hint of psychopathology. Later, Lani mentions to Jonathan that she has suspicions of Dr. Leland Eugene, but Jonathan says he cannot go on a hunch alone. Following this, Lani is critically injured while in cryo-sleep by an apparent malfunction. Along the way to Demeter, they pick up the long lost astronaut Capt. Jacob 'Jake' Brown, while stopping at an abandoned station to make some repairs. Brown initially paralyzes Huxley with a weapon, but it is revealed that he did so to prevent Huxley from walking straight into an \\"anti- matter zone\\". Capt. Brown is accepted on board as an advisor to Jonathan and, finding out that the crew is only armed with hand weapons, volunteers to build a rail-gun with the help of Beinstock in an airlock. Jonathan then receives evidence of the death of Capt. Forbes and Lani's coma that points to Leland, the psychiatrist. When Jonathan confronts him, Priscilla calls Jonathan about suspicious activity in the rail-gun's airlock. Jonathan investigates and finds Brody, the fitness instructor, is sabotaging the rail-gun, a fight ensues and the fitness instructor is jettisoned out of the airlock. A transmitter is later discovered amongst his possessions, that he was apparently using to keep in contact with a blip that intermittently appeared on the Voyager's long range scans. The crew also explores a distress signal from a massive space station known as 'the 2020 World's Fair', which is inhabited by warriors and researchers of the Outlaw Technology Zone. The landing party is captured by the warriors after encountering one of Captain Brown's former crew members, Willy. They discover that the mutinous Vance has also landed here and became \\"Top Dog\\" of the warriors by employing a stunner much like the one Brown used on Huxley. A warrior, named Whistlestick, who was beaten and humiliated by Vance, explains that anyone may challenge the \\"Top Dog\\" at any time. Huxley demonstrates his skill at pickpocketing by getting the key for their cage. Brown offers to occupy their captors by challenging Vance while the rest escape. After a difficult fight, Brown (who taught Vance how to make such weapons long ago) is able to make Vance's weapon backfire and destroys it - but spares Vance's life (unaware that Sally was watching and afraid that he would be killed by Jake). In the ensuing ruckus, the crew and their two new allies escape. The next discovery, explaining how Vance and Willie got to the World's Fair Station in the first place, was finding the wreckage of the Vanguard Explorer. Capt. Brown requests permission to board it and retrieve his logs to prove that the loss of his ship was due to mutiny, and to see if there was anything left salvageable. Beinstock, the Doctor, and he find the ship to still have some power and computer function, but also find an unwelcome guest known as a 'Shell'‚Äîa cyborg. Brown is able to shock the Shell into unconsciousness, and Doctor Arthur insists they take him to the ship to help and examine him. In a cut-away scene, it is revealed that Adm. Beasley has become aware of the Shell's presence on Voyager, but is unable to do anything about it. Willie explains that the Shell is a cyborg created by the O.T.Z. and, although it is only a drone, it is probably packed with explosives. The Doctor, with the help of Beinstock, is able to disarm the explosives and treat his injuries, and is able to bring the Shell back to consciousness while also keeping him immobilized. They interrogate the Shell, and he mentions that his function is to help facilitate \\"Assembly\\". Data from the Vanguard indicates that several odd-looking ships passed by the Vanguard from the World's Fair over the last few years. Later analysis indicates the ships are modular. Later on, Dr. Arthur speaks to the Shell and discovers that he was abducted and turned into a cyborg when he was young. After making some small adjustments to him to ease his discomfort, Doctor Arthur and he form a brief emotional connection before his programming returns him to his drone- state. Later, he regains his full movement and smashes his way through the ship, damaging Capt. Brown's jury-rigged railgun weapon and one of Priscilla's processors. The Shell warns them that they must stop \\"Assembly\\" then deactivates himself rather than let his programming make him kill Dr. Arthur. In another cut-away scene, Vance finds himself in dire straits back on the World's Fair as the warriors now hunt him for his treatment of them. Admiral Beasley appears and demands an explanation from him. Their dialogue indicates that the mutiny on the Vanguard Explorer was part of some design of Beasley's and that Beasley is somehow connected, if not in control of, the O.T.Z. After Vance reveals he was defeated by the presumed-dead Capt. Brown, Beasley leaves Vance to his fate, and returns to the Corsair. This scene is left out of some versions of the show. Back on board Voyager, the crew have made repairs and discover how their spacecraft fits into a conspiracy concocted by the Outlaw Technology Zone and Admiral Beasley, the mastermind behind the entire plot (including the construction of Earth*Star Voyager, the selection of the crew, and the creation of the 'Shell'). The O.T.Z. ships, the Assembly, were stationed in a binary solar system to use the light from the stars upcoming alignment to give them sufficient power to join together and form an even more massive and heavily armed ship. A section of the completed Assembly was designed to allow Voyager to fit in near the bow. Beasley's ship fires warning shots at Voyager to keep them on course to the Assembly, and then he reveals why he had chosen the best and the brightest the world had to offer to crew Voyager. He intended Voyager not to be an exploratory vessel but a colony ship. Joining the Voyager to the O.T.Z. Assembly would give Beasley the Bowman Drive and Priscilla. This would enable him to choose whom else would get to be part of his new Utopia, while leaving the rest of humanity to rot back on Earth. However, the crew outwits Admiral Beasley and escapes (after a battle in which they use jury-rigged weapons, including a 'solar laser' (which can gather and redirect solar energies in a beam-like fashion), and the railgun built by Jake and Beanie). During the battle, Jake nearly sacrifices himself to hold together part of the electrical circuit that allows the railgun to be fired; he is saved by Sally. Aboard the Admiral's damaged vessel, the Triton Corsair, Admiral Beasley acknowledges Jonathan's skill as a commander, and promises that he will meet up with the crew of the Earth*Star Voyager again someday. There is an alternate scene of this in the 120-minute VHS version where Beasley is revealed to be some sort of robot or cyborg (or perhaps himself a Shell), while leaving out the promise dialogue. Aboard the Earth*Star Voyager, Lani is found to be recovering from her injuries; Beanie and Luz (prodded by Priscilla) become a couple; it is strongly insinuated that Jake and Sally will become a couple; and Huxley is stunned to see that Priscilla (in human form) is a very beautiful woman. Beanie also reveals to Jonathan that he has decrypted the probe data and the crew sees that Demeter is a planet with striking similarities to Earth. The last line of the miniseries goes to Jake, who says, \\"You know, Captain, I think we oughta go check that place out...\\" Additional information Many of the lead actors (at least 6) were born in Canada. The production was shot entirely in Vancouver, Canada and partially filmed inside the Soviet Pavilion built for Expo '86. Of the bootleg versions available, the lesser quality media has seemed to disappear over the years, while they do occasionally pop up from time to time. Of the higher quality versions, there still seem to be two different versions available. While both contain the entire broadcast movie, one version boasts a complete movie -minus the commercials and introductions -starring the former Disney CEO, Michael Eisner. The version without the commercials seems to be one of the better quality versions, and those who find private sellers occasionally end up with the semi-rare custom DVD artwork. The show (240 minutes in 4 series) was screened by the Ostankino 2 channel in Russia in Winter 1993 in their 'Disney film classics' series on Fridays.

Effectively defunct for nearly half a century, these laws returned to public notice in 2005 when changes were included in an Anti- terrorism Bill announced by Prime Minister Howard prior to a \\"counter- terrorism summit\\" of the Council of Australian Governments on 27 September. The Bill was introduced on 3 November and passed into law on 6 December 2005 after government amendments adding some protection for the reporting of news and matters of public interest were introduced in response to community pressure. __TOC__ History Early prosecutions for sedition in Australia include: * the conviction of Henry Seekamp for seditious libel over the Eureka Rebellion in 1854; * the conviction of 13 trade union leaders of the 1891 Australian shearers' strike for sedition and conspiracy; and * the action against radical Harry Holland, jailed for two years in 1909 over his advocacy of violent revolution during the Broken Hill miners' strike. During the First World War Sedition laws were used against those who opposed conscription and war, in particular the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in Australia.Ian Turner, Sydney's Burning (An Australian Political Conspiracy) (1969) In 1916 members of the IWW in Perth were charged with sedition including 83-year-old Montague Miller, known as the grand old man of the labour movement. Miller was released after serving a few weeks of his sentence but was re-arrested in 1917 in Sydney at the age of 84 and sentenced to six months jail with hard labour at Long Bay Gaol on the charge of belonging to an unlawful association.Joe Toscano, Australian Anarchist History - Monty Miller, Anarchist Age Weekly Review Number 215 2 September 1996 The Sydney Twelve were all charged and convicted with various offences including sedition. Lance Sharkey, then General-Secretary of the Communist Party of Australia, was charged that, in March 1949 he: > uttered the following seditious words: \\"If Soviet Forces in pursuit of > aggressors entered Australia, Australian workers would welcome them. > Australian workers would welcome Soviet Forces\\". The last prosecution was in 1960, when Department of Native Affairs officer Brian Cooper was prosecuted for urging \\"the natives\\" of Papua New Guinea to demand independence from Australia. He was convicted, and committed suicide four years later, after losing his appeal. =Recent cases= The Australian government in 2006 investigated Islamist books found in Lakemba and Auburn in Sydney promoting suicide bombings, anti-Australian conspiracies and racism, but the Australian Federal Police found in 2006 they did not breach Commonwealth Criminal Code or NSW Crimes Acts 1900.Muslim 'books of hate' get OK Daily Telegraph, 15 May 2006 Previous Law Colonial legislation, for example the Queensland Criminal Code (1899), first established sedition in Australian law. The Federal period offence of sedition was created in the Federal Crimes Act (1914).Federal Crimes Act (1914) =Seditious Intention= Section 24 defined a seditious intention as [a]n intention to effect any of the following purposes: :(a) to bring the Sovereign into hatred or contempt; :(d) to excite disaffection against the Government or Constitution of the Commonwealth or against either House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth; :(f) to excite Her Majesty's subjects to attempt to procure the alteration, otherwise than by lawful means, of any matter in the Commonwealth established by law of the Commonwealth; or :(g) to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of Her Majesty's subjects so as to endanger the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth; =Seditious Enterprises= Section 24B defined a seditious enterprise as an enterprise undertaken in order to carry out a seditious intention, and Section 24C specified that [a] person who engages in a seditious enterprise with the intention of causing violence, or creating public disorder or a public disturbance, is guilty of an indictable offence punishable on conviction by imprisonment for not longer than 3 years, although Section 24D(2) provided that [a] person cannot be convicted of any of the offences defined in section 24C or this section upon the uncorroborated testimony of one witness. =Seditious Words= Section 24B defined seditious words as words expressive of a seditious intention, and Section 24D(1) specified that [a]ny person who, with the intention of causing violence or creating public disorder or a public disturbance, writes, prints, utters or publishes any seditious words shall be guilty of an indictable offence punishable by [i]mprisonment for 3 years. =Summary Prosecution= Section 24E allowed that, while an accused person might elect to be committed for trial, sedition could, with the consent of the Attorney-General, be prosecuted summarily, in which case the applicable penalty would be imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months. =Good Faith= Section 24F specified that nothing in the preceding provisions made it unlawful: :(a) to endeavour in good faith to show that the Sovereign, the Governor-General, the Governor of a State, the Administrator of a Territory, or the advisers of any of them, or the persons responsible for the government of another country, has or have been, or is or are, mistaken in any of his or their counsels, policies or actions; :(b) to point out in good faith errors or defects in the government, the constitution, the legislation or the administration of justice of or in the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or another country, with a view to the reformation of those errors or defects; :(c) to excite in good faith another person to attempt to procure by lawful means the alteration of any matter established by law in the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or another country; :(d) to point out in good faith, in order to bring about their removal, any matters that are producing, or have a tendency to produce, feelings of ill-will or hostility between different classes of persons; or :(e) to do anything in good faith in connexion with an industrial dispute or an industrial matter. In considering a good faith defence, it was specifically noted that the Court might consider whether the case involved the safety or defence of the Commonwealth; assistance to countries or organisations at war with the country or its allies, or to enemies of its allies (whether or not they are enemies of Australia); traitors or saboteurs; or the intention of causing violence or creating public disorder or a public disturbance. =Unlawful Organisations= Section 30A declared that any body of persons, incorporated or unincorporated (or [a]ny branch or committee of an unlawful association, and any institution or school conducted by or under the authority or apparent authority of an unlawful association) which by its constitution or propaganda or otherwise advocates or encourages (or which is, or purports to be, affiliated with any organization which advocates or encourages) sabotage; damage to property used in cross-border trade or commerce; revolution or war against either any civilised country or organised government; or the doing of any act having or purporting to have as an object the carrying out of a seditious intention was an unlawful association for the purposes of the Act. The Act went on to criminalise members (deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to include attendees at a meeting, those speaking in public in advocacy of an association or its objects or distributing its literature), officers, representatives and teachers in any institution or school conducted by or under the authority or apparent authority, of an unlawful association, as well as persons printing or selling material produced by, or intentionally permitting a meeting in their premises of, such an association. Howard-era Laws Schedule 7 of the Anti- Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005, Federal Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 and memoranda (and sedition-specific Schedule 7 of the draft bill ) passed by the Upper House on 6 December 2005, repealed Sections 24A to 24E of the Crimes Act (1914) and reintroduced them, along with several new classes of offence, in a Division 80‚ÄîTreason and sedition. Crimes in this division now attract a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment. =Seditious Intention= The definition of \\"seditious intention\\" originally in Section 24A has become (as amended): An intention to effect any of the following purposes: :(a) to bring the Sovereign into hatred or contempt; :(b) to urge disaffection against the following: ::(i) the Constitution; ::(ii) the Government of the Commonwealth; ::(iii) either House of the Parliament; :(c) to urge another person to attempt, otherwise than by lawful means, to procure a change to any matter established by law in the Commonwealth; :(d) to promote feelings of ill-will or hostility between different groups so as to threaten the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth. =Sedition= Subdivision 80.2 of the proposed legislation (as amended) specifically criminalises Urging the overthrow of the Constitution or Government: :(1) A person commits an offence if the person urges another person to overthrow by force or violence: ::(a) the Constitution; or ::(b) the Government of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or ::(c) the lawful authority of the Government of the Commonwealth. Similarly, it introduces the offence of [urging] another person to interfere by force or violence with lawful processes for an election of a member or members of a House of the Parliament, and Urging violence within the community: :(a) the person urges a group or groups (whether distinguished by race, religion, nationality or political opinion) to use force or violence against another group or other groups (as so distinguished); and :(b) the use of the force or violence would threaten the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth. Additionally, it is now specifically illegal to [urge] a person to assist the enemy: :(a) the person urges another person to engage in conduct; and :(b) the first-mentioned person intends the conduct to assist ~~, by any means whatever,~~ an organisation or country; and :(c) the organisation or country is: ::(i) at war with the Commonwealth, whether or not the existence of a state of war has been declared; and ::(ii) specified by Proclamation made for the purpose of paragraph 80.1(1)(e) to be an enemy at war with the Commonwealth. or to [urge] a person to assist those engaged in armed hostilities: :(a) the person urges another person to engage in conduct; and :(b) the first-mentioned person intends the conduct to assist ~~, by any means whatever,~~ an organisation or country; and :(c) the organisation or country is engaged in armed hostilities against the Australian Defence Force. except where such urgings are by way of, or for the purposes of, the provision of aid of a humanitarian nature. These new crimes are all punishable by Imprisonment for 7 years. =Good Faith= The new legislation, in subsection 80.3 Defence for Acts done in Good Faith, updates the circumstances for good faith exemption in a fashion similar to the definition of seditious intention, above. =Extraterritoriality= The new law specifies, under section 80.4 Extended geographical jurisdiction for offences, that: :Section 15.4 (extended geographical jurisdiction - category D) applies to an offence against this Division Originally introduced into Australian law as a consequence of Australia's acceptance of the International Criminal Court, Section 15.4 of the Criminal Code Act (1995)Federal Criminal Code Act 1995 provides that offences under category D apply: :(a) whether or not the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs in Australia; and :(b) whether or not a result of the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs in Australia. Category D ‚Äî initially applicable only to such crimes as genocide and crimes against humanity ‚Äî specifically omits provisions restricting its scope to Australian citizens, and therefore applies to any person in any country, giving Australia universal jurisdiction over the crime of sedition. =Amendments= The following amendments were introduced to the Bill prior to its passage. *(68) Schedule 7, item 4, page 109 (line 14), after an intention, insert to use force or violence. *(69) Schedule 7, item 12, page 111 (line 11), omit subsection 80.2(2), substitute: :(2) Recklessness applies to the element of the offence under subsection (1) that it is: ::(a) the Constitution; or ::(b) the Government of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or ::(c) the lawful authority of the Government of the Commonwealth; :that the first- mentioned person urges the other person to overthrow. *(70) Schedule 7, item 12, page 112 (lines 6 and 7), omit , by any means whatever,. *(71) Schedule 7, item 12, page 112 (lines 18 and 19), omit , by any means whatever,. *(72) Schedule 7, item 12, page 113 (line 29), at the end of subsection 80.3(1) (before the note), add: :; or (f) publishes in good faith a report or commentary about a matter of public interest. =Penalties and Scope= The new laws more than double the maximum penalty for sedition from three years imprisonment to seven, and allow certain convictions relating to the use of force or violence on the basis of recklessness rather than proven intent. However, the amended laws no longer include specific penalties for uttering seditious words, nor provisions relating to seditious enterprises, although the definition of seditious intent continues to apply in the determination of unlawful organisations. Additionally, all prosecutions for sedition (no longer just summary prosecution) now require the approval of the Attorney-General, although this does not apply to arrests. =Implications= The principal changes to sedition law in the proposed bill seem to involve: * the inclusion of sedition along with the separate crime of treason under their new joint heading; * an increase in the maximum penalties from three to seven years; * the introduction of the concept of recklessness; * the inapplicability of seditious intention to individuals not associated with an unlawful organisation; * its extension to foreign citizens. Perhaps most importantly, the \\"modernisation\\" of the laws seems to indicate that the government, apparently in the expectation of an increase in seditious activity, now intend to actively enforce laws which had been allowed to fall into disuse. =Review= The Anti-Terrorism Bill (No 2.) 2005 included provisions for a five-year review, and has a ten-year sunset clause. In addition, the Coalition backbench committee, in response to significant public outcry about the potential for the new legislation to stifle free speech and despite the government's claims about a new and imminent threat necessitating the passage through both houses of the limited and specific Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005, successfully lobbied the government to introduce an earlier review of the sedition provisions and accept certain minor amendments. The majority Senate committee report into the Bill, delivered on 28 November 2005, recommended amongst 52 proposed changes that the sedition provisions be removed from the Bill until after a review, claiming they were poorly drafted and undermined free speech, and that the existing law negated any urgency for their introduction. The report's recommendations were dismissed by the government. ALRC Review In December 2005, The Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock foreshadowed an independent review of the amended sedition laws, and provided the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) with formal Terms of Reference for this purpose on 2 March 2006.Australian Law Reform Commission Issues Paper 30, Review of Sedition Laws, includes detailed history, legislative review, questions section; register for sedition-related mailing list In particular, the ALRC has been asked to examine: * whether the amendments, including the sedition offence and defences in sections 80.2 and 80.3 of the Criminal Code, effectively address the problem of urging the use of force or violence; * whether \\"sedition\\" is the appropriate term to identify this conduct; * whether Part IIA of the Crimes Act, as amended, is effective to address the problem of organisations that advocate or encourage the use of force or violence to achieve political objectives; and * any related matter. In carrying out its review, the ALRC will have particular regard to: * the circumstances in which individuals or organisations intentionally urge others to use force or violence against any group within the community, against Australians overseas, against Australia‚Äôs forces overseas or in support of an enemy at war with Australia; and * the practical difficulties involved in proving a specific intention to urge violence or acts of terrorism. On 20 March 2006 the ALRC, \\"committed to consulting as widely as possible, within the short timeframe provided\\", released an Issues Paper and opened submissions until 10 April 2006 to feed the drafting of a discussion paper including legislative options and a final report with recommendations for tabling by the Attorney-General. In May 2006 the Discussion Paper was released. Responsive public submissions to the inquiry closed on 3 July 2006. =Opposition to the Provisions= Despite almost unconditional support for the remainder of the Anti-Terrorism Bill, by mid-November the main opposition Australian Labor Party (including two of the Premiers involved in the original COAG meeting) had joined several prominent Coalition backbenchers in calling for the removal of the Bill's sedition provisions, and committed itself to their repeal in the event it gained government.  Repeal  The Government accepted the recommendations of the ALRC report Fighting Words: A Review of Sedition Laws in Australia, which included removing the term ‚Äòsedition‚Äô and replacing it with the phrase ‚Äòurging violence‚Äô and clarifying and modernising elements of the offences. The term 'sedition' was removed from in the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. Incitement At common law it is unlawful to incite a crime. Additionally, the Criminal Code Act (1995) specifically details the crimes of incitement and conspiracy, making it an offence to: *incite, urge, aid or encourage; or *print or publish any writing which incites to, urges, aids or encourages; **the commission of offences against any Federal or Territory law or carrying on of any operation for or by the commission of such offences. Incitement of or conspiracy to commit an act of sedition would therefore be punishable as a crime, although incitement to incite sedition is specifically not a criminal act under the Code.

Career Boland was Assistant Secretary of the Department of External Affairs from 1939 to 1946 prior becoming the Secretary, which he held until 1950. In that role, he led negotiations in 1949, which changed Ireland's status from membership of the Commonwealth to that of a Republic. He was privately critical of the manner in which the Taoiseach, John A. Costello, handled the matter, saying that \\"he has as much notion of diplomacy as I have of astrology.\\"McCullagh, David The Reluctant Taoiseach Gill and Macmillan 2010 p.197 He served as the first Irish Ambassador to the Court of St James's in London from 1950 to 1956, a move generally attributed to his inability to work harmoniously with Sean MacBride, Minister for External Affairs 1948-51.McCullagh p.228 In 1956, he became Ireland's Ambassador to the United Nations. Boland was the president of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 12 October 1960, when Nikita Khrushchev allegedly took off his shoe and pounded it on his desk. Boland served as the 21st Chancellor of Trinity College Dublin between 1963 and 1982.

The system was developed in the mid-1980s and entered service in 1993. The APQ-181 provides a number of precision targeting modes, and also supports terrain-following radar and terrain avoidance. The radar operates in the Ku band (a subset of the J band). The original design uses a TWT-based transmitter with a 2-dimensional passive electronically scanned array (PESA) antenna. In 1991, the B-2 Industrial Team (including Hughes as a major subcontractor) was awarded the Collier Trophy in recognition of the \\"design, development, production, and flight testing of the B-2 aircraft, which has contributed significantly to America's enduring leadership in aerospace and the country's future national security.\\" In 2002, Raytheon was awarded a contract to develop a new, active electronically scanned array (AESA) version of the APQ-181. This upgrade will improve system reliability, and will also eliminate potential conflicts in frequency usage between the B-2 and commercial satellite systems that also use the J band. In 2008 the Federal Communications Commission accidentally sold the APQ-181 frequency to a commercial user resulting in the need for installing new radar arrays at a cost of over $1 billion.

Music Nothing to Fear possesses a more hard-edged sound than the band's previous releases, featuring louder electric guitar and percussion, an increased and more varied use of synthesizers and the introduction of sequencers on some tracks. The songs also feature an unorthodox range of instruments, some of which were designed and built by the band. Initial vinyl pressings of the album contain a different mix of the song \\"Private Life,\\" featuring more prominent bass guitar and xylophone. The single version, which was subsequently used on all re-releases of the album, is 27 seconds shorter than the initial album mix, truncating the transition into the chorus, among other alterations. The song's release was accompanied by a music video, directed by Danny Elfman's brother Richard Elfman, founder of The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. In April 2020, Danny Elfman reprised \\"Running on a Treadmill\\" in a new solo rendition on his official website and Instagram page, recorded in self-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic with an accompanying video filmed by his daughter, Mali Elfman. It is only one of two Oingo Boingo songs Elfman has publicly performed since the band broke up in 1995. Reception Despite continuous condemnation from critics, Nothing to Fear received high regional sales and radio airplay at the time of its release, selling 125,000 copies in its original run. Elfman often used the negativity of critics to the band's advantage through publicity, stating: \\"The music [the critics] like is inspirationless and contrived. If we start getting praise from this clique of six or eight reviewers, we'd probably have to evaluate where we went astray.\\" Following the album's release, the band went on a successful tour opening for bands such as The Police and Fear.

It is held at Caulfield Racecourse, Melbourne, Australia as a lead in to the Spring Racing Carnival. Total prize money for the race is A$750,000. History The race is often used as a lead- up race by good horses preparing for the longer feature races such as the Caulfield Cup, Cox Plate and Melbourne Cup. Such horses typically compete against less glamorous, and usually fitter, sprinter-milers who have been trained specifically for this race. Speed and fitness seem to prevail over class about half the time, as can be seen in the list of recent winners. As the race comes early in the Spring, it will often indicate how well a horse has come back after its customary winter spell. There is sometimes just as much interest in the horses running on well from the back of the field, as there is in the actual winner. A good run by a staying horse in this race is often a good indicator of a successful Spring Carnival to come. The Memsie Stakes is a virtually identical race to the P B Lawrence Stakes, another 1,400 metre weight-for-age race run at Caulfield usually earlier in August except that this is the first Group 1 in the racing season in Victoria. The list of previous winners of the race contain recent champions, including Sincero, So You Think, Weekend Hussler, Makybe Diva, Sunline, Naturalism, Rancho Ruler, Manikato, and famous champions from the 20th century Galilee, Rising Fast, Comic Court, Lord (four times), Ajax (three times) and Phar Lap.

It is part of the traditional region of √òsterdalen. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Tolga. The municipality is bordered in the east by the municipality of Tynset, in the south by Rendalen, and in the east by Engerdal and Os, all in Hedmark county. General information =Name= The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Tolga farm because the first church in the parish was built here (in 1688). The farm is named after the small Tolga River, and the river name is probably derived from the word toll, which means '(young) pine (tree)'. Prior to 1918, the name was spelled Tolgen. Tolga Church =Coat-of-arms= The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 14 July 1989. The arms show a gold bell on a red background. Tolga was home to the smeltehytte from 1666 to 1871, and the bell represents the old bell in the town square at the center of Tolga. The smeltery was important because of the prevalence of mining in the area. History The parish of Tolgen was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). Some parts of Tolga were transferred to the neighboring municipality of Engerdal on 1 January 1911. The new municipality of Os was separated from Tolga on 1 July 1926. (Tolga and Os were briefly merged from 1966 to 1976. See Tolga-Os.) Tolga Church (Tolga Kirke) is an octagonal church built in 1840. The edifice is of timber and it has 400 seats. The previous church on the site was built in 1688.

Existing from at least 1344, the Inns gradually changed their purpose, and became both the offices and accommodation for solicitors (as the Inns of Court were to barristers) and a place of initial training for barristers. The practice of training barristers at the Inns of Chancery had died out by 1642, and the Inns instead became dedicated associations and offices for solicitors. With the founding of the Society of Gentleman Practisers in 1739 and the Law Society of England and Wales in 1825, a single unified professional association for solicitors, the purpose of the Inns died out, and after a long period of decline the last one (Clement's Inn) was sold in 1903 and demolished in 1934. History The Inns of Chancery evolved in tandem with the Inns of Court. During the 12th and early 13th centuries the law was taught in the City of London, primarily by the clergy. But during the 13th century an event occurred which ended legal education by the Church. A papal bull in 1218 prohibited the clergy from practising in the secular, common law courts. As a result, law began to be practised and taught by laymen instead of by clerics. To protect their schools from competition, Henry II and Henry III issued proclamations prohibiting the teaching of the civil law within the City of London.Bellot (1902) p. 32 These schools were based in hostels or \\"inns\\", which later took their name from the landlord of the inn in question.Watt (1928) p. 5 Early-18th-century engraving of Furnival's Inn by Sutton Nicholls The Inns of Chancery sprung up around the Inns of Court, and took their name and original purpose from the chancery clerks, who used the buildings as hostels and offices where they would draft their writs.Steel (1907) p. 586 As with the Inns of Court the precise dates of founding of the Inns of Chancery are unknown, but the one commonly said to be the oldest is Clifford's Inn,Steel (1907) p. 590 which existed from at least 1344. Thavie's Inn, founded in 1349, is considered to be the next oldest, and several legal historians mistakenly considered it the oldest of them all.Watt (1928) p. 55 For several centuries, education at one of the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students.Watt (1928) p. 10 At the end of each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.Watt (1928) p. 57 At the same time, the Inns of Chancery was used as accommodation and offices by solicitors, the other branch of the English legal profession. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the purpose of the Inns changed. After the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, the practice of teaching barristers in the Inns ceased, and as a result the Inns of Chancery became a dedicated association for solicitors instead, offering offices and accommodation. The foundation of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers and Law Society of England and Wales in 1739 and 1825 respectively as professional bodies for the solicitors profession relegated the Inns of Chancery to little more than eccentric dining clubs, and they were gradually dissolved and sold. In 1897 a popular book reported that nobody could remember the purpose of the buildings and that an 1850 investigation had failed to uncover their origins. The last Inn to be sold was Clement's Inn, which was sold in 1903, and demolished in 1934. Inns Staple Inn in 1886 John Fortescue wrote of ten Inns of Chancery, each one attached to an Inn of Court \\"like Maids of Honour to a Princess\\".Watt (1928) p. 9 Only nine are known of in detail;Loftie (1895) p. 252 the other was St George's Inn.Bellot (1902), pp. 24-25; 32 The ten Inns were: * Clement's Inn, Lyon's Inn and Clifford's Inn attached to the Inner Temple, * St George's Inn, Strand Inn, and New Inn attached to the Middle Temple, * Furnival's Inn and Thavie's Inn attached to Lincoln's Inn, and * Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn attached to Gray's Inn. (An eleventh Inn of Chancery, the Outer Temple, was said to exist by the legal historian John Baker in 2008.Baker (2008) p. 386 This is denied by other writers.Bellot (1902), p. 22.) Many Inns were originally independent of the Inns of Court, and fell in and out of allegiance with them, with some claiming independence right up to the nineteenth century. Most Inns became directly attached to Inns of Court during the sixteenth century, however, when the Inns of Court began charging higher acceptance fees to students trained in independent Inns of Chancery than they did to students trained in \\"their\\" Inns of Chancery. =Inner Temple attachments= Clement's Inn was the last to be dissolved, being shut down in 1903. Located near St Clement Danes, the Inn was also named after Saint Clement and took as its coat of arms his, with a large letter C in sable.Loftie (1895) p. 280 The buildings were completely rebuilt in the 19th century in the Queen Anne Style. Noted members included Sir Edmund Saunders, and William Shakespeare made Justice Shallow, a character in Henry IV, Part 2, a member of the Inn.Webster (1911), p. 586 Members were noted as \\"a wild lot\\" known for their drinking and parties.Steel (1907) p. 592 In its later years the Inn was a poor one, and had no library or chapel, with most of the funds being spent on repairs and maintenance for the building.Steel (1907) p. 593 Lyon's Inn was \\"a place of considerable antiquity\\", with records from 1413. Originally a hostel, it was purchased by the inhabitants and turned into an Inn of Chancery. Initially a small but respected Inn that educated people as noted as Sir Edward Coke, Lyon's Inn became a disreputable institution that \\"perished of public contempt long before it came to the hammer and the pick\\".Steel (1907) p. 591 By the time it was dissolved it was inhabited only by the lowest lawyers and those struck off the rolls, and when surveyed it was found that it was run by only two Ancients, neither of whom had any idea what their duties were, and the Inn had not dined for over a century. The Inn was dissolved in 1863,Loftie (1895) p. 283 pulled down in 1868Webster (1911), p. 584 and replaced with the third Globe Theatre. Clifford's Inn was the oldest of the Inns of Chancery, and was first mentioned in 1344. Although generally considered a dependent of the Inner Temple, its members always maintained that they were independent.Loftie (1895) p. 262 As a note of that \\"independence\\" it became custom for the Inner Temple to send them a message once a year, which would be received but deliberately not replied to. Their coat of arms was a modified form of the Clifford family arms, with \\"cheque or and azure, a fess gules, a bordure, bezant√©e, of the third.\\" Noted students include John Selden; Sir Edward Coke was also said to have studied there, but historical records find no evidence of this, and he was always associated with Lyon's Inn more than Clifford's.Loftie (1895) p. 266 =Middle Temple attachments= The first lawyers to occupy the premises which later became the Middle Temple came from St George's Inn,Bellot (1902), pp. 24-25; 238 arriving by 1346.Bellot (1902), pp. 21-22 The inn was later deserted in favour of New Inn.Bellot (1902), p. 238 Strand Inn, also called Chester Inn, was the shortest lived of the Inns of Chancery. Founded in the fifteenth century it was pulled down in the 1540s by Lord Somerset in his role as Lord Protector so that he could build Somerset House. The students instead went to New Inn, and Strand Inn was absorbed into that Inn. Thomas Occleve was said to have studied at Strand Inn. New Inn was founded in the late 15th century on the premises of Our Lady Inn, a hostel. Noted students included Sir Thomas More, who attended New Inn before going to Lincoln's Inn.Bellot (1902), pp. 240 The buildings of New Inn were pulled down in 1902 to make way for a road between Holborn and the Strand. After the destruction of Strand Inn, New Inn was the only Inn of Chancery left attached to the Middle Temple.Bellot (1902) p. 239 =Lincoln's Inn attachments= Furnival's Inn was founded before or during the reign of Henry IV and named after the Lords Furnival.Steel (1907) p. 587 During the 1820s the Inn was completely rebuilt. Noted tenants include Charles Dickens, who began to write The Pickwick Papers whilst living there.Loftie (1895) p. 261 The Inn was demolished in 1897. Thavie's Inn was the second oldest Inn of Chancery, and was founded around 1349. It was sold in 1769.Watt (1928) p. 3 Lawyers from Thavie's Inn were the first to occupy the premises which became Inner Temple in the 1320s.Bellot (1902), pp. 22-25 =Gray's Inn attachments= Staple Inn dated from at least 1415, and was originally an inn where wool merchants stayed and haggled. In reference to this, the Inn coat of arms contained a bale of wool.Douthwaite (1886) p. 254 During the reign of Elizabeth I it was the largest of the Inns of Chancery, with 145 students and 69 as permanent residents. The buildings survived the great fire of London and were rebuilt in the seventeenth century,Douthwaite (1886) p. 256 and again in the nineteenth. The Inn was shut down and the building sold to the Prudential Assurance Company in 1884, and part of it is now used as the headquarters of the Institute of Actuaries. Barnard's Inn, originally known as Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, was established in 1454 as an Inn of Chancery.Douthwaite (1886) p. 257 A large Inn, Barnard's had 112 students a year during the reign of Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence. When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he got something wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year, who was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.

The Lord Howe Rise is a deep sea plateau which extends from south west of New Caledonia to the Challenger Plateau, west of New Zealand in the south west of the Pacific Ocean. To its west is the Tasman Basin and to the east is the New Caledonia Basin. Lord Howe Rise has a total area of about 1,500,000 square km, and generally lies about 750 to 1,200 metres under water. It is part of Zealandia, a much larger continent that is now mostly submerged, and so is composed of continental crust. Formation The Lord Howe Rise was formed by seafloor spreading which also resulted in the creation of the Tasman Sea. It was rifted away from Eastern Australia by a mid-ocean ridge that was active from 80 to 60 million years ago, and now lies 800 kilometres offshore from mainland Australia. The Lord Howe Rise contains a line of seamounts called the Lord Howe Seamount Chain which formed during the Miocene period when this part of Zealandia existed over the Lord Howe hotspot. Lord Howe was the last volcano to erupt on the rise. Islands, reefs and seamounts Lord Howe Island and Ball's Pyramid cap a seamount towards the central east of the rise in an area known as the Lord Howe platform. The Lord Howe Seamount Chain extends northwards along the rise. The seamounts provide habitat to a diverse range of marine species which attracts commercial fishers, but cover a very small area, less than 1% of the total area of Lord Howe Rise.Harris, P.T., 2011.

It has approximately 2,300 undergraduate and graduate students through the College of Arts and Sciences, the McColl School of Business, the Wayland H. Cato, Jr. School of Education, the James L. Knight School of Communication, and the Andrew Blair College of Health, which features the Presbyterian School of Nursing. Established in 1857, the university offers 34 undergraduate majors and 66 concentrations, and 10 graduate programs. It is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). History The main entrance to Queens University of Charlotte Founded in 1857 as the Charlotte Female Institute, the school was originally at College and 9th streets in what is now Uptown Charlotte. From 1891 to 1896, it was called the Seminary for Girls. In 1896, the Concord and Mecklenburg Presbyteries chartered the Presbyterian Female College. The seminary merged with this new college. In 1912, anticipating the move to the present campus in the Myers Park neighborhood, the school became Queens College. The name Queens College was adopted for three reasons: at the request of the Alumnae Association to disarm prejudice in deference to other Presbyterian colleges which claimed an equal right to the denominational name; to commemorate Queen's Museum, a classical school established in Charlotte in 1771; and to honor Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg. In the aftermath of World War II, Queens admitted its first male students. A co-educational Evening College was established in 1948 that provided instruction for adults. It was the forerunner of the New College, which was inaugurated in 1979 as an undergraduate evening program designed for working adults. In 1995, New College was renamed the Pauline Lewis Hayworth College. In 1979, the traditional undergraduate liberal arts college at Queens was renamed the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). It began admitting resident males in 1987 when Queens went co-ed. In 1989, CAS adopted the innovative Foundations of Liberal Learning program, which is now known as the Core Program in Liberal Arts and is required of all first-year students. The International Experience Program, now known as the John Belk International Program, was established in 1989. Juniors and seniors participate in a variety of study programs that range from study tours, language programs, a month-long environmental studies program in Yap in Micronesia or a summer-long foreign internship, to semester-long study abroad exchanges in Hong Kong or Ireland. Since its inception, the program has received national recognition from U.S. News & World Report. Queens ranked no. 2 in the country for its \\"percentage of students who travel abroad\\" (2009) with close to 90 percent participation. In 2008, the program added study tours to Vietnam and South Africa. In 1996, the Internship and Career Development Program, also nationally recognized, began requiring a minimum of six credit hours for all students enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. The program has been recognized in the past by U.S. News & World Report as one of the leading internship programs in the country; it boasts 100 percent participation from the university's student body. Queens' first master's degree program, the Master of Business Administration, launched in 1980. Since then, Queens has added the Master of Education (1983); the Executive Master of Business (1990); the Master of Arts in Teaching (1992); the Master of Science in Nursing (1998); the Master of Arts in Organizational and Strategic Communication (1999); the Low-Residency Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing (2001); the Master of Science in Organization Development (2008) and Master of School Administration (2008). With the additional master's degree programs, Queens achieved a university level rank in the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the U.S. News & World Report. The Board of Trustees voted in the Spring of 2002 to recognize Queens' true university status and changed the institutional name from \\"Queens College\\" to \\"Queens University of Charlotte.\\" The change became official on June 1, 2002. The university obtained the former Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing to form the Presbyterian School of Nursing at Queens in 2004. One of the most popular majors at Queens, the program produces the third-largest number of new registered nurses among higher education institutions in North Carolina. In 2006, the university officially opened its 65-acre Sports Complex at Marion Diehl Park, a planned $15 million project that is a partnership between Mecklenburg County and the university. Additionally, in 2008, Queens opened the Knight School of Communication and Wayland H. Cato School of Education that became its fifth and sixth primary units on its Myers Park campus. The Wayland H. Cato School of Education focuses on undergraduate education and runs graduate programs. In 2010, the School of Communication was renamed the James L. Knight School of Communication through a naming grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The grant initiatives include working to improve digital and media literacy in the Charlotte community. Daniel G. Lugo assumed the role of Queens' 21st president on July 1, 2019, after the retirement of Dr. Pamela Davies, who led Queens for 17 years. Academics Many of Queens University's students are enrolled in either the Business and Marketing programs (33% of undergraduates) or the Communications and Journalism programs (15% of undergraduates). Rounding out the top three most popular majors are the health professions, which are studied by approximately 10% of the undergraduate population, according to the College Board. =General Education program= Queens University has an undergraduate general education curriculum called the \\"Queens Advantage\\". Students join learning communities, where they work together to develop solutions and build connections between their experiences at Queens and the world around them. Learning communities gather small groups of students from diverse backgrounds and interests to collaborate towards common objectives. A learning community that includes students studying history, biology, and communication may collaborate to examine a topic such as sustainability, social justice, or immigration. Within these interdisciplinary environments, the groups explore new concepts, express their voice, and activate higher levels of thinking to evaluate themes and address real-world issues. During their senior year, students weave together all they've learned during Queens Advantage into one culminating experience. When they complete the curriculum, students are able to evaluate approaches to complex problems, integrate learning from multiple contexts, and communicate fluently. =Blair College of Health= The Blair College of Health houses the Presbyterian School of Nursing, Human Service Studies Department, and Kinesiology Department. =Knight School of Communication= The Knight School of Communication was established in 2010 and is the only school of communications in the country to be endowed by the Knight Foundation. It houses two undergraduate programs (Bachelor of Arts in Communication and a Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Storytelling) and two graduate programs (Master of Arts in Communication and a Master of Arts in Communication‚ÄîOnline). =McColl School of Business= The McColl School of Business was established in 1993 and is named after Bank of America chairman Hugh McColl, Jr. The school has been accredited by AACSB International since 2007 and offers undergraduate business degrees in accounting, business administration, finance, management and marketing leading to the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree. The school is known for its internship program (all students complete internships), its study abroad program (John Belk Study Abroad Program), and its high placement rate for graduating seniors. The school is home to the McColl School of Business DECA Chapter and the McColl Investment Club. The McColl School of Business is the home of two graduate programs - Master of Business Administration (MBA) and Master of Science in Organization Development (MSOD). The Flexible MBA enables flexible delivery options through on-campus study or through distance education. Students may elect to follow one mode exclusively or mix and match modes.

Athletics Queens University of Charlotte's athletic teams take the identity of the Queens Royals on the field and cheer their teams on via their mascot, Rex. Queens is a member of the NCAA's Division II program nationally; regionally, the Royals participate in the South Atlantic Conference. Prior to 2013 the Royals participated in Conference Carolinas. A statue of Rex at the Queens Sports Complex is the largest standing lion sculpture in the world. Effective as of the 2013‚Äì14 academic year, Queens joined the South Atlantic Conference along with fellow Conference Carolinas member, Coker College to become the SAC's 11th and 12th members. Currently, the Royals are home to two (2016, 9th and 2017 5th) top 10 Learfield Cup finishes as one of the top athletic departments in the country. The University proudly displays ten National Championship trophies (5 for women's swimming and 5 for men's swimming). The triathlon program has also taken the lead in Division II as three-time National Champions. Further, the Royals Track and Field squad has dominated their respective conference and boasts several individual National Champions. =Men's sports= Men's athletic teams include baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross-country, golf, lacrosse, rugby,http://www.goffrugbyreport.com/news/queens-uni-charlotte-all-rugby soccer, swimming, tennis, track & field, volleyball, triathlon, and wrestling. =Women's sports= Women's athletic teams include basketball, cheerleading, dance, cross-country, equestrian, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field, volleyball, and triathlon.

She is currently employed as a chair Professor in the Indian Council of Social Science Research. Kishwar along with fellow-academic Ruth Vanita have been regarded as pioneer scholars of women's studies in India; they were the founder editors of the critically acclaimed journal - Manushi. Whilst her earlier work in the domain were quite favorably received by the academia and fellow activists, her reputation was considerably affected post the '90s, once she began to increasingly embrace the growing support for Hindutva. She has been awarded the Chameli Devi Jain Award for Outstanding Women Mediaperson in 1985.  Early life and education Kishwar graduated from Miranda House in Delhi, where she was the President of the Student's Union. She received her postgraduate degree in history from Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi.  Career  She was a professor and a senior fellow at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), until retiring in 2016. Post her retirement, she asserted the institution of being a chaotic fiefdom of the chosen few and alleged the higher echelons of CSDS to be ideologically biased towards left, who treated her unfairly for years due to ideological differences, and supposedly, even robbed her of a legitimate government awarded scholarship. The institute rejected the allegations, en masse. She then joined the Indian Council of Social Science Research as the Maulana Azad Professor. In 2017, she was appointed to the Academic Council of the School of Art and Aesthetics of Jawaharlal Nehru University. The appointment was perceived to be politically motivated with her domain-expertise being questioned and students protested in large numbers. Kishwar rejected the charges, describing them as whining of the leftist intellectuals, who were losing their clout. = Manushi and feminism = Kishwar, along with Ruth Vanita, were the founding-editors of Manushi, a highly acclaimed journal in the domain of women's studies in India. Established to bridge the gap between academic discourse and popular activism by raising awareness of gender inequalities through ground-activism, it has been one of the longest-running and most-influential women's periodicals in South Asia to the extent of being heavily instrumental in setting the agenda for women-right-movements. Manushi has been described by Amartya Sen as \\"a pioneering feminist journal\\". Her books and miscellaneous writings in the topic area have been also quite favorably received. Notably, Kishwar does not self-identify as a feminist. Kishwar's (self-proclaimed) reasons behind the disapproval of feminism aligns with that of the postcolonial feminist theory - perceiving liberal feminism as a monolithic western entity which discounts indigenous ways of life and actively incorporates a western framework. Anita Anantharam, an associate professor of Women's Studies at University of Florida, writing over Feminist Media Studies in 2009, deems Kishwar to subscribe to a brand of aggressively nationalist feminism that takes a highly holistic view of the local society, culture and traditions. She notes that as the editorial board of Manushi thinned out over the years for varied reasons and the journal came under near-absolute stewardship of Kishwar, it chose to embrace the contemporaneous rise of the right-wing-nationalism through the realms of Hindutva. This led to the introduction of religious and communal discourses into a hitherto secular and non-polarized space which vocally urged for a return to a golden atavistic past and amplified the \\"hierarchies of \\"East\\" versus \\"West\\", Indian womanhood versus western feminism, and Hindu versus Muslim identity\\" from the lenses of religion and ethno-nationalism. Kishwar has since criticized her fellow feminists urging for laws to prohibit the Hindu practice of Sati, instead focusing on the potential hampering of freedom to undergo death by a means of their choice and the implications of a secular state trying to regulate religious customs; she had also attacked other avenues of feminist activism from anti-dowry legislation to purported abolition of khaps and introduction of female quota bills, from within the Hindu way of life, arguing for a more nuanced and cultural approach, if at all. Her views have been challenged and rejected by numerous other feminists. She was also one of the fiercest critics of the highly acclaimed film Fire, which focused a spotlight on the lesbian community in India. Deeming that as ramblings of a self-hating-Indian that was meant to stereotype and vilify Hindus, she mocked the queer rights movements to be a Western import that went contrary to the ethos of Hindu public life and middle class values. Gradually, in the process, she joined a newly evolving group of (self-proclaimed) Hindutva scholars in asserting of biases in the western (and marxist) scholarship of Indic religions and weaponed Manushi as a tool during the California textbook controversy over Hindu history et al.‚ÄîAnantharam notes a heavy intermingling of Hindutva and her works by the middle 2000s. Anantharam goes on to note that almost all contemporary feminists have since disowned their roles in the magazine to avoid any association with this hyper- nationalistic cum Hindu fervor. Of late, she has been an often-vitriolic critic of the newer waves of the (allegedly) western-derived maisntream feminist movements in India; using pejoratives abundantly and portraying them as fascist endeavors reeking of dominating and oppressing the male gender. She had lodged legal petitions arguing for dilution of anti-rape laws to mitigate bias against males and has been also highly skeptical of the motivations of foreign-funded NGOs, working for the causes of women. Some scholars have now come to recognize Kishwar as a former feminist who has since turned into an ally of anti-mainstream-feminist causes. = Politics and fake news = Kishwar has been noted for her adulation of Narendra Modi, to the extent of comparing him with Mahatma Gandhi. She had also written a book that absolved him, a then prime-ministerial candidate of any involvement in the 2002 Gujarat riots and effusively praised him as a non-communal politician. Incidentally she used to be a vocal critic of Modi. Kishwar has been accused of aiding in the propagation of communal material and to have propagated fake news over numerous occasions, via her Twitter handle.

His father was a farmer. He attended Coe College and graduated in 1887. After two years as an instructor at a business school, the Fort Dodge Commercial Institute, he went to Germany for graduate study at the University of Berlin. He returned to the U.S., and in 1891 he received his PhD from Johns Hopkins University in political economy under Richard T. Ely, with minors in philosophy and ethics.Encyclopedia of World Biography on Edward Alsworth Ross Ross was a professor at Indiana University (1891‚Äì1892), secretary of the American Economic Association (1892), professor at Cornell University (1892‚Äì1893), and professor at Stanford University (1893‚Äì1900). In the field of economics, he made contributions to the study of taxation, debt management, value theory, uncertainty, and location theory. Ross affair and departure from Stanford In Stanford's \\"first academic freedom controversy\\",Casper, Gerhard (1995). Die Luft der Freiheit weht - On and Off. Stanford University, Office of the President. Ross was fired from Stanford because of his political views on eugenics. He objected to Chinese immigrant labor (on both economic and racial grounds: he was an early supporter of the \\"race suicide\\" doctrine and expressed his wish to restrict entry of other races in strong and crude language in public speeches) and Japanese immigration altogether. In the speech that was the catalyst for his potential firing and ultimate resignation, he was quoted as declaring: > And should the worst come to the worst it would be better for us if we were > to turn our guns upon every vessel bringing Japanese to our shores rather > than to permit them to land In response, Jane Stanford called for his resignation. In Ross' public statement as to his resignation, he wrote about how his good friend, Dr. Jordan, was the one who asked him to make the unfortunate speech in the first place, which ended up being surrounded with so much controversy. Jordan managed to keep Ross from being fired, but Ross resigned shortly after. The position was at odds with the university's founding family, the Stanfords, who had made their fortune in Western rail construction, a major employer of coolie laborers. Ross had also made critical remarks about the railroad industry in his classes: \\"A railroad deal is a railroad steal.\\" This was too much for Jane Stanford, Leland Stanford's widow, who was on the board of trustees of the university. Numerous professors at Stanford resigned after protests of his dismissal, sparking \\"a national debate... concerning the freedom of expression and control of universities by private interests.\\" The American Association of University Professors was founded largely in response to this incident. Nebraska, Wisconsin, and later life Ross left for the University of Nebraska, where he taught until 1905.Keith, Bruce (1988). \\"The Foundations of an American Discipline: Edward A. Ross at the University of Nebraska, 1901‚Äì1906,\\" Mid-American Review of Sociology, Vol. 13, No. 2, pp. 43‚Äì56. In 1906, he moved to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he became Professor of Sociology, and eventually chairman of the department. He retired in 1937. His understanding of Americanization and assimilation bore a striking resemblance to that of another Wisconsin professor, Frederick Jackson Turner. Like Turner, Ross believed that American identity was forged in the crucible of the wilderness. The 1890 census's proclamation that the frontier had disappeared, then, posed a significant threat to America's ability to assimilate the mass of immigrants who were arriving from southern and eastern Europe. In 1897, just four years after Turner had presented his frontier thesis to the American Historical Association, Ross, then at Stanford, argued that the loss of the frontier destroyed the machinery of the melting pot process.Weinberg, Julius (1967). \\"E. A. Ross: The Progressive as Nativist,\\" The Wisconsin Magazine of History, Vol. 50, No. 3, pp. 242‚Äì253. In 1913, the State of Wisconsin passed its first sterilization law. Ross, who lived in Wisconsin at the time, was a reserved proponent of sterilization and indicated his support for the measure. He qualified his support by contrasting it with the greater harm of hanging a man and advocated its initial use \\"only to extreme cases, where the commitments and the record pile up an overwhelming case.\\" Involuntary sterilization remained legal in Wisconsin until July 1978. Ross visited Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. He endorsed the revolution even as he acknowledged its bloody origins. He was subsequently a leading advocate of US recognition of the Soviet Union. However, he later served on the Dewey Commission, which cleared Leon Trotsky of the charges made against him by the Soviet government during the Moscow Trials.Dewey Commission Report From 1900 to the 1920s, Ross supported the alcohol Prohibition movement as well as continuing to support eugenics and immigration restriction.McMahon, Sean H. (1999). Social Control and Public Intellect: The Legacy of Edward A. Ross, Transaction Publishers. By 1930, he had moved away from those views, however. In the 1930s, he was a supporter of the New Deal programs of President Franklin Roosevelt. In 1940, he became chairman of the national committee of the American Civil Liberties Union, serving until 1950. He died in 1951. Works * Honest Dollars. Chicago: C. H.

He is best known for his chef-d'oeuvre Nalacharitham aattakatha and is known to have made significant contributions to the art of Kathakali, the classical dance-drama form of Kerala. Biography There are only sketchy details available regarding Unnayi Warrier's real name, exact date and place of birth, his family background and literary achievements. There is consensus among scholars that his family name was 'Akathoottu Warriam' and that he was a garland maker (traditional vocation of Warriers (Variar)) by profession at Irinjalakkuda Koodalmanikyam Temple. One tangible record available that throws light on his life and times is that his work Nalacharitham aattakatha - 2nd day was enacted during the festival season of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple at Thiruvananthapuram(Trivandrum) in 1749 AD. This indicates that Nalacharitham was authored by Warrier during the first half of 18th century or earlier. There is speculation that Ramapurathu Warrier was a disciple of Unnayi Variyar and as noted by Aimanam Krishna Kaimal in his celebrated work Attakkatha Sahityam, it is reasonable to assume Unnayi Warrier lived between 1674 and 1754 C.E. Kaimal also infers that Unnayi's real name was 'Raman' which he deduced from the last sloka of another of Unnayi's works - Girijakalyanam attakatha mentions the author's name to be 'Raman'.  Works  = Nalacharitham = The most famous work of Unnayi Warrier is Nalacharitham Aattakkatha. The work is divided into four parts/days with each part designed in such a way as to be presented as an independent performance. Nalacharitham elevated the literary standards of Kathakali and is widely recognised to be path breaking and pioneering in its approach to make Kathakali a complete art form. Root story of Nalacharitham Kathakali song is based on the Mahabharata (chapters 52 to 79 of Aaranyaparvam). It is one of the stories told by sage B rihadaswan to Pandava prince Yudhishthira during the despondent times that Pandavas go through during their exile. Story revolves around the most righteous Nishadha king Nala, his wife Damayanti and the troubles they undergo in spite of being pious and virtuous and how in the end they are absolved and restored to their previous glory and joy.By many accounts Nalacharitham is considered to be the complete aatakatha via its perfect storyline, masterly rendering and consistent aesthetics. = Other works = Besides Nalacharitham, two more works are credited to Warrier. Ramapanchashati is a poem praising Sree Ramam Murthi of Koodalmanikyam Temple comprising 500 slokas in Sanskrit while Girijakalyanam, an essay in three parts based on Mahabharata. Influence Fundamental influence that Unnayi Warrier has had on Kathakali is on the emergence of the importance of Rasa (aesthetics) as against a more dominant Bhava Bhava abhinaya. Warrier, through his Nalacharitham, is widely acknowledged to have raised the dramatic value of Kathakali as an art form.  Unnayi Warrier Smaraka Kalanilayam  Unnayi Warrier Smaraka Kalanilayam is an eponymous institute, affiliated to the Government of Kerala, which offers training courses in various performing arts and music.

It was first published in 1951, in French, as Malone meurt, and later translated into English by the author. Malone Dies contains the famous line, \\"Nothing is more real than nothing\\" ‚Äì a metatextual echo of Democritus' \\"Naught is more real than nothing,\\" which is referenced in Beckett's first published novel, Murphy (1938). As part of the Trilogy Written immediately after the completion of Molloy, and finished in the summer of 1948, Malone Dies is the second novel in Beckett's \\"Trilogy.\\" Like Molloy, Malone Dies furthers Beckett‚Äôs project to \\"empty the novel of its usual recognizable objects‚Äîplot, situation, characters‚Äîand yet to keep the reader interested and moved.\\" Lacking much of Molloy's trace linearity or characteristic humor, with Malone Dies \\"we can hardly be sure of much more than that Malone, whoever he is, is dying and at the end is dead; the rest is nightmare.\\" As Gabriel Josipovici observes, whereas Molloy/Moran reflects on the past to write memoir, Malone will write \\"only of what is happening to him. If necessary, to pass the time, he will tell a few stories, but the anecdotes will only be aspects of the present.\\" In fact, Malone‚Äôs habit of beginning but then interrupting or abandoning his stories not only demonstrates the faulty fiction-making capacity of the mind, but reveals \\"its impotence as an instrument towards fulfillment.\\" Confined to bed, Malone's predicament reflects the Trilogy‚Äôs progressive restriction of locomotor freedom and the shift from an outer to and inner search, not only for meaning, but for \\"a final letting go, a dying which is more than the cessation of breathing.\\" Plot summary Malone is an old man who lies naked in bed in either asylum or hospital‚Äîhe is not sure which. Most of his personal effects have been taken from him, though he has retained some: his exercise book, brimless hat, and pencil. He alternates between writing on his own situation and on that of a boy named Sapo. When he reaches the point in the story where Sapo becomes a man, he changes Sapo's name to Macmann, finding Sapo a ludicrous name. Soon after, Malone admits to having killed six men, but seems to think it's not a big deal, particularly the last: a total stranger whom he cut across the neck with a razor. Eventually, Macmann falls over in mud and is taken to an institution called St. John's of God. There he is provided with an attendant nurse: an elderly, thick-lipped woman named Moll, with crosses of bone on either ear representing the two thieves crucified with Jesus on Good Friday, and a crucifix carved on her tooth representing Jesus. The two eventually begin a stumbling sexual affair, but after a while she does not return, and he learns that she has died. The new nurse is a man named Lemuel, and there is an animosity between the two. Macmann (and sometimes Malone drifts into the first-person) has an issue with a stick that he uses to reach things, then Lemuel takes it away. At the end of the novel, Lemuel is assigned to take his group of five inmates on a trip to a nearby island on the charitable dime of a Lady Pedal. His five inmates are Macmann and four others. They are described by Malone thus: a young man, the Saxon (\\"though he was far from being any such thing\\"), a small and thin man with an umbrella, and a \\"misshapen giant, bearded.\\" Lemuel requests \\"excursion soup\\" (the regularly served broth but with a piece of fat bacon to support the constitution) from the chef at the institution, though after receiving the soup he sucks each piece of bacon of its juice and fat before depositing it back into the soup. Lemuel takes his group onto the terrace where they are greeted by a waggonette driven by a coachman and Lady Pedal, along with two colossi in sailor suits named Ernest and Maurice. They leave the grounds of St. John's and take a boat to the island to picnic and see Druid remains. Lady Pedal tells Maurice to stay by the dinghy while she and Ernest disembark the boat to look for a picnicking site. The bearded giant refuses to leave the boat, leaving no room for the Saxon to get off in turn. When Lady Pedal and Ernest are out of sight, Lemuel kills Maurice from behind with a hatchet. Ernest comes back for them and Lemuel kills him, too, to the delight of the Saxon. When Lady Pedal sees this, she faints, falls, and breaks a bone in the process. Malone as narrator is not sure which bone, though he ventures Lady Pedal broke her hip. Lemuel makes the others get back in the boat. It is now night and the six float far out into the bay. The novel closes with an image of Lemuel holding his bloodied hatchet up. Malone writes that Lemuel will not hit anyone with it or anything else anymore, while the final sentence breaks into semantically open-ended fragments: The majority of the book's text, however, is observational and deals with the minutiae of Malone's existence in his cell, such as dropping his pencil or his dwindling amount of writing lead. Thoughts of riding down the stairs in his bed, philosophical observations, and conjectures constitute large blocks of text and are written as tangential to the story that Malone is set on telling. Several times he refers to a list of previous Beckett protagonists: Murphy, Mercier and Camier, Molloy, and Moran. BBC broadcast A reading of selected passages from Malone Dies was broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 18 June 1958, with repeats on 19 June and 15 October 1958. Beckett selected the passages, which were read by the actor Patrick Magee, and incidental music, scored for harmonica, two mandolins, tuba, cello and double bass, was composed by Samuel's cousin John S. Beckett. The programme was produced by Donald McWhinnie.Gannon, Charles: John S. Beckett ‚Äì The Man and the Music, pp. 117‚Äì20, 122. Dublin: 2016, Lilliput Press. .

The squadron comprises six flights of approximately 180 officer and enlisted personnel. United States military personnel serve in the Republic of Korea (ROK), shoulder to shoulder with the ROK military, in order to ensure the continuation of the country's democratic government. Location Songtan grew up around Osan Air Base and was originally just four tiny farming villages. When Osan Air Base was established in 1952, the closest town of any size was Osan-eub, from which Osan Air Base got its name. Songtan officially became a city on 1 July 1981 and has since grown to a population of 110,000. As of 10 May 1995, Songtan merged with the nearby larger city of Pyeongtaek and became part of a metropolis of 310,000 people covering an area of . The Songtan-Pyeongtaek area has become a major industrial site and is home to many factories. The merger has seen the development of Pyeongtaek as a major port city, with access to a West Coast highway linking Incheon to Mokpo. A deep water harbor has recently been completed at Pyeongtaek. The city is rapidly becoming a major port and industrial complex on the West Coast of South Korea. References to Songtan are being changed over to Pyeongtaek, but many people (and some official signs) still use Songtan and Songtan City, and a Songtan exit was recently added on the Seoul-Busan Expressway. For the time being, any reference to Songtan is to the area just outside the main gate of Osan Air Base. =Surrounding area= Songtan has many shops and outdoor stands that offer goods at a much lower price than in the States. In the past you could barter and get a cheaper price on almost anything but now most store owners have a set price. Some will come down a small amount. History The squadron was first activated on 1 October 1993 as the 7th Air Intelligence Squadron and fell under the 7th Air Operations Group. On 15 December 1994, 7 AF reorganized, creating the 607th Air Intelligence Group (607 AIG). The squadron was then redesignated on that date as the 607th Air Intelligence Squadron (607 AIS) and subordinate to the 607 AIG, along with the 303d Intelligence Squadron, which is under operational control of the 607 AIG. Today the 607 AIS, working with its republic of Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) counterpart, the 37th Tactical Intelligence Group, represent a key element in the U.S. commitment to the growth of combined USAF/ROKAF Intelligence capabilities. It is our combined responsibility to ensure our Intelligence products are timely, thorough, and accurate, for our enemy is one who takes his war fighting capabilities very seriously and is ever seeking the opportunity to put them to the test. We accept the challenge of the mission, carry it proudly into the future, and always stand ready and willing to continually meet the challenges faced by seventh air force and the air component command. =Contingencies= Mission The 607 AIS provides the Combined Forces Air Component Command (CFACC)/Commander, Seventh Air Force (7AF) with the Intelligence support necessary to plan, conduct, control and coordinate air operations in accordance with the tasks assigned by the commander, Air Component Command (CACC) and the commander, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). These activities are accomplished through the commander, 607th Air Intelligence Group (607 AIG). Specific functions include indications and warning, analysis, targeting, collection management support, exploitation, and dissemination of all-source Intelligence information in support of combat planning, combat operations, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) management, and combat readiness of 7AF and subordinate units to include theater gained assets. The 607 AIS is primarily an Aerospace Operations Center (AOC)unit. The 607 AIS provides substantive Intelligence support to 7AF, Air Component Command (ACC), United States Forces Korea (USFK) and in-country and deployed unit Intelligence staffs. Day-to-day the squadron commander organizes trains and equips his personnel to perform their roles and missions in the KOREAN AOC (KAOC). He ensures the squadron: develops and maintains the ability to immediately support theater combat operations; develops, tests, refines, documents, and exercises armistice/wartime operational procedures; establishes working relationships with members of ROK, allied and other U.S. forces which will enhance wartime effectiveness. =Analysis Flight= The 607 AIS, Intelligence Analysis Flight (INA) is the focal point for all-source Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB) and the Predictive Intelligence Analysis for the 607 AIS and the Korean Air Operations Center (KAOC). INA provides daily assessments to the commander, Seventh Air Force (7AF), his staff, Korean counterparts, and the theater-gained units. During armistice, the analysis flight is designated as INA. During wartime, the analysis flight integrates as one of the five specialty teams into the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance division (ISRD) as the Analysis, Correlation, and Fusion (ACF) Flight. The mission of INA is to provide the Air Operations Center (AOC) ISRD an accurate picture of the battlespace and deliver predictive battlespace awareness to enable air component command's war fighting capabilities. =Operations Flight= Provide the commander, staff and subordinate units of 7AF/acc with fused, multi-source indications & warning.

History  Laraki was established in 1999 by Abdesslam Laraki, a Moroccan designer and entrepreneur who first became wealthy by importing cars in Morocco beginning in 1973. His son and the current owner of the firm is Abdeslam Laraki, a Moroccan designer who started out creating luxurious yachts and created the eponym company Laraki. Then following the steps of his father, he studied automobile design in Switzerland and soon after launched his first model, the Laraki Fulgura, in 2002. Eric Van Hove's V12 Laraki In 2012, the conceptual artist Eric Van Hove arrived in Marrakech to resume work on an ambitious sculptural endeavor he had prepared for years: V12 Laraki. In the space of nine months, he gathered around him 42 master craftsmen from the region and began rebuilding a Mercedes 6.2 L V12 engine using rural materials and centuries old craft techniques from the North African country. Conceptually, this sculpture is based on the story of the Laraki Fulgura, which was entirely manufactured in Morocco to the exception of its engine. The artist decided to try and reproduce that cutting-edge component locally using craft That sculpture was displayed at the 5th Marrakech Biennale and soon acquired by the Hood Museum of Art. The technical director is Peter Tutzer, previously from Bugatti. Models =Fulgura= The Laraki Fulgura is the company's first attempt at a sports car. Originally unveiled as a concept at the 2002 Geneva Motor Show, a proposed production version debuted a year later at the same show. A slightly redesigned version of the bodywork was unveiled in 2005. Based on the frame and mechanicals of a Lamborghini Diablo, the Fulgura is equipped with a quad-turbo Mercedes-Benz 6.0 L V12, initially proposed to produce , attached to a 6-speed manual transmission. A new aerodynamic carbon fibre body is also added. This brings the Fulgura to an estimated price of $555,750. Performance for the Fulgura is an estimated top speed of and acceleration of 0 ‚Äì in 3.3 seconds. By 2006, these figures were amended and the 6.0 L V12 was proposed to produce , and mated to a 7-speed gearbox and a top speed of and 0‚Äì100 km/h in 3.4 seconds. =Borac= Laraki Borac The Laraki Borac is the company's second model, and debuted as a concept at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show. The car was originally planned for production by 2011, but a final design was never unveiled. The design of the Borac is that of a grand tourer, with a front engine layout and even the possibility of two small rear seats. The Borac is not based on an existing design, unlike the Fulgura. A Mercedes-Benz 6.0 L V12 powers the Borac, although it lacks the turbocharging of the Fulgura. This results in a proposed output of , producing a top speed of and acceleration from 0 - 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. =Epitome= The Laraki Epitome was unveiled at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in 2013. Nine cars of this model are planned to be built. Fitted with the V8 engine of a C6 Chevrolet Corvette, Laraki added twin turbochargers to the already powerful engine. Fueled by 91-octane gasoline fuel, the Epitome can produce 1,200 Horsepower. Additionally it has a second fuel tank that can be filled with 110-octane gasoline fuel, which can up it to 1,750 Horsepower. The body is made of carbon fiber.The Laraki Epitome Engineering. 27 August 2013. Retrieved 29 September 2014. The car weighs 2,800 pounds. The Epitome made the headlines: With a $2 million price tag, it was dubbed the most expensive car on the market. Hip-hop artist French Montana bought one of the 9 models planned for production.

In 1872, she married Edward Argles, a Dublin solicitor, who died less than six years later. They had three daughters. To support the fatherless family, she wrote her first novel, Phyllis. Soon after its favourable reception, she wrote Molly Bawn, which became her best-known book. She married Thomas Henry Hungerford, of Cahirmore, in 1882, with whom she had two sons and one daughter. They lived at St. Brenda's, Bandon, County Cork. By contemporary accounts, she enjoyed country life and was an avid gardener. She rarely travelled far from home. She was one of the few women in Victorian times who was both a prolific author and mother of a sizeable family. She died at Bandon of typhoid fever on 24 January 1897. Writing The writer as a girl (right), with her sister. She approached her writing methodically, setting aside three hours every morning for it. The room where she did her writing had neatly organised manuscripts at her desk, surrounded by many reference works, novels, and other books. Her books were first published anonymously, and later as by \\"Mrs. Hungerford\\". In the United States, her books were mostly published under the pen name \\"The Duchess\\". Some of her early books were published by William Tinsley, a major publisher at the time. Often writing on commission, she wrote many novels, short stories, and newspaper articles. Her books continued selling as fast as she could write them. Her plots follow the usual conventions of romantic novels of the day. They contain delicate love scenes that were never offensive to the ideals of Victorian morals. Her works are characterised as entertaining and charming, though usually not of great depth. She tends to have little in the way of character development, tending more towards flirtatious dialogue. She was adept at capturing the tone of her contemporary fashionable society, and sometimes used Irish settings. Molly Bawn Hungerford's best-known novel is Molly Bawn (1878) the story of a frivolous, petulant Irish girl, a flirt, who arouses her lover's jealousy and naively ignores social conventions. Mrs. Hungerford and this book are mentioned in chapter 18 of James Joyce's Ulysses: :\\"...Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I don't like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders...\\" =\\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\"= Molly Bawn contains Hungerford's most famous idiom: :\\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\".Hungerford, MW (1878).

Life and career Sheffer was a Polish Jew born in the western Ukraine, who immigrated to the USA in 1892 with his parents and six siblings. He studied at the Boston Latin School before entering Harvard University, learning logic from Josiah Royce, and completing his undergraduate degree in 1905, his master's in 1907, and his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1908. After holding a postdoctoral position at Harvard, Henry traveled to Europe on a fellowship. Upon returning to the United States, he became an academic nomad, spending one year each at the University of Washington, Cornell, the University of Minnesota, the University of Missouri, and City College of New York. In 1916 he returned to Harvard as a faculty member in the philosophy department. He remained at Harvard until his retirement in 1952. Scanlan (2000) is a study of Sheffer's life and work. Sheffer proved in 1913 that Boolean algebra could be defined using a single primitive binary operation, \\"not both . . . and . . .\\", now abbreviated NAND, or its dual NOR, (in the sense of \\"neither . . . nor\\").Geoffrey Hunter, An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First- Order Logic, MacMillan, London and Basingstoke, 1971. Likewise, the propositional calculus could be formulated using a single connective, having the truth table either of the logical NAND, usually symbolized with a vertical line called the Sheffer stroke, or its dual logical NOR (usually symbolized with a vertical arrow or with a dagger symbol). Charles Peirce had also discovered these facts in 1880, but the relevant paper was not published until 1933. Sheffer also proposed axioms formulated solely in terms of his stroke.Henry Maurice Sheffer. A set of five independent postulates for Boolean algebras, with applications to logical constants, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, volume 14, 1913, pages 481-488. Presented to the Society 13 December 1912. Sheffer introduced what is now known as the Sheffer stroke in 1913; it became well known only after its use in the 1925 edition of Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica. Sheffer's discovery won great praise from Bertrand Russell, who used it extensively to simplify his own logic, in the second edition of his Principia Mathematica. Because of this comment, Sheffer was something of a mystery man to logicians, especially because Sheffer, who published little in his career, never published the details of this method, only describing it in mimeographed notes and in a brief published abstract. W. V. Quine's Mathematical Logic also made much of the Sheffer stroke. A Sheffer connective, subsequently, is any connective in a logical system that functions analogously: one in terms of which all other possible connectives in the language can be expressed. For example, they have been developed for quantificational and modal logics as well. Sheffer was a dedicated teacher of mathematical logic. He liked his classes to be small and did not like auditors. When strangers appeared in his classroom, Sheffer would order them to leave, even his colleagues or distinguished guests visiting Harvard. Sheffer was barely five feet tall; he was noted for his wit and vigor, as well as for his nervousness and irritability. Although widely liked, he was quite lonely. He is noted for a quip he spoke at his retirement: \\"Old professors never die, they just become emeriti.\\" Sheffer is also credited with coining the term \\"Boolean algebra\\". Sheffer was briefly married and lived most of his later life in small rooms at a hotel packed with his logic books and vast files of slips of paper he used to jot down his ideas. Unfortunately, Sheffer suffered from severe depression during the last two decades of his life. Notes * Scanlan, Michael, 2000, \\"The Known and Unknown H. M. Sheffer,\\" The Transactions of the C.S.

Designed by Curtis D. Summers and constructed by the Dinn Corporation, the roller coaster opened to the public on March 23, 1991. Psyclone's design was modeled after the well-known Coney Island Cyclone roller coaster, a historical landmark located at Coney Island in New York City. It featured eleven hills, five high-speed banked turns, and a dark tunnel. Bolliger & Mabillard, a company that builds steel roller coasters, manufactured the trains for Psyclone. History Following the debut of Georgia Cyclone at Six Flags Over Georgia in 1990, Six Flags again hired Curtis D. Summers and Charles Dinn of Dinn Corporation to design and construct a similar wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain. Georgia Cyclone had caused multiple injuries in the short time since its opening and had to undergo several modifications to tone down the ride's profile. For Magic Mountain, Six Flags requested a gentler version. On December 27, 1990, Six Flags Magic Mountain announced that Psyclone would be added to the park. It would be located towards the back of the park in the former site of Shockwave. Summers incorporated eleven hills and five banked turns into the design of Psyclone. It was constructed of unpainted, Southern Yellow pine and opened to the public on March 23, 1991. Decline The ride sustained structural damage after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 and though repaired to operate safely again, the ride dynamics suffered greatly in regard to vehicle tracking. Major modifications happened, including adding trim brakes that slowed the trains down to the point of making the trains crawl through each turn. The heavy trains took their toll on the track structure and the coaster became very rough. Because of this, ridership at the attraction had drastically declined, in part because it earned a poor reputation among park visitors and also because ride operators at the ride were required to load a minimum of 17 passengers in the train prior to dispatch. This policy was enforced to reduce the chances of the vehicles from stalling mid-ride due to lack of momentum. Because of this policy, during low attendance periods, the ride, while technically operational, would go for extended periods of time without dispatching a train as the operators waited for 17 riders to arrive. A 2006 poll of roller coaster enthusiasts ranked Psyclone 178th out of 179 wooden roller coasters worldwide. On January 23, 2007, the park announced that Psyclone along with Flashback would be removed from the park for future expansion. The following month after the announcement, Psyclone was demolished and piles of wood remained at the site for several days until construction walls were erected at the site. According to RCDB, Psyclone last operated in 2006. Apocalypse: The Ride opened in its place in 2009.

When production ceased in 1979, a total of 20,844 instruments were built. History The EB-0 was first marketed in 1959 in response to the declining sales of Gibson's EB-1. The body was styled after the Les Paul Junior, but retained the mahogany neck and body and 30.5\\" scale length of the Gibson EB-1. It was available only in cherry red. This version of the EB-0 remained in production until 1961, after which the body was redesigned to resemble the Gibson SG (like the contemporary EB-3). The design of the bass guitar changed several times during the 1960s. In 1962, the black plastic cover on the pickup was replaced by a metal one. Around 1964/5, nickel-plated hardware was replaced by chrome-plated. Around 1966/7 the neck was replaced with a thinner one; the unadjustable bar bridge was replaced by a fully adjustable one with a nylon saddle for each string. Under the bridge a lever-activated string mute system was also implemented, in contrast to Fender basses' glued on or screwed in foam mutes. This setup did not prove particularly popular, however, and was phased out in favor of Gibson's new \\"3-point bridge\\". The string guard was also removed; a bridge guard was introduced and the knobs were replaced with the witch-hat design. In 1969 and 1970, the headstock was replaced with a slotted one (similar to those on most classical guitars), with tuning keys mounted at ninety degrees downwards behind the head. Between 1962 and 1965, Gibson produced a more expensive version called the Gibson EB-0F, which while superficially near identical, bar a longer pickguard also featured a built-in Fuzz box. This variety sold very poorly and remains fairly obscure. The EB-0 generally came with one pickup, a large humbucker placed up close to the neck. This pickup, particularly in this configuration is known for its distinctive tone, especially its large, booming low end, owing to its unique design and exceptionally high output. This pickup, colloquially known as the \\"Mudbucker\\" for its \\"muddy\\" tone, and by Gibson itself as a \\"Sidewinder\\", as the pickup is wound from left to right side. Several aftermarket alternatives for mudbuckers have been available, some in smaller sizes. Billy Sheehan, bassist of Mr. Big, famously installed an EB-0 pickup in his Fender Precision Bass. In 1972, the EB-0 saw another, less dramatic revision. It received a larger body, a maple neck, and its pickup was moved further from the base of the neck. Despite these revisions, sales dropped significantly in the subsequent years and production was gradually phased out. The last EB-0 was made in 1979. Epiphone currently produces an EB-0 which is similar to the late '60s version of the Gibson EB-0, but with a '70s-style three-point bridge and a bolt-on neck. This version, along with the Epiphone EB-3, was discontinued in early 2020 as a part of a major reimagining of the Epiphone brand and lineup. Variants The EB-0 fathered two variations. * EB-0F - This was an EB-0 with a built-in passive fuzz. They were produced in limited quantities between 1962 and 1965. * EB-0L - This was a long-scale (34\\") version of the EB-0. It was produced between 1970 and 1977.  Notable EB-0 players  * Dennis Dunaway of Alice Cooper played a spray-painted metallic green EB-0 named \\"The Frog\\". * Mike Watt of Minutemen and Firehose plays a heavily modified ‚Äô65 Gibson EB-0.

After his premature retirement due to a medical condition, he continued his sporting career as a soccer player for South Melbourne FC in the Victorian Premier League and as an Australian rules football coach. Early life Lekkas was born to Greek parents and grew up in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. He played soccer until he was a teenager, when he switched to playing Australian rules and played with the Northern Knights under-18s. AFL career Lekkas was taken by Hawthorn at pick number 17 overall (Hawthorn's first pick) in the 1993 AFL Draft which was a trade for Tony Hall (when Hall left the Hawks for Adelaide). After three seasons in the reserves, Lekkas made his senior debut in 1996. Lekkas forged a solid career with the Hawks, playing mostly between half forward and half back. In 2002, he represented Australia in the International Rules series. After a practice match in February 2005, Lekkas suffered an apparent minor stroke and was told he might never play again. After fully recovering, he made his return to AFL football in round 15, 2005, against Adelaide. Lekkas announced his early retirement from AFL football on 26 August 2005, his last game being played at the MCG against Sydney on 27 August 2005. Lekkas finished his AFL career with 180 games and 120 goals to his credit and a career total of 14 Brownlow votes. Post AFL-career After Lekkas retired, he took up a lawsuit against the Hawthorn Football Club, claiming that the club caused his early retirement by pressuring him to continue playing after the stroke. The case was later settled out of court. Lekkas was condemned by some supporters for playing the case out via the media with his manager Jacques Khouri, given Hawthorn's apparent support of Lekkas and a lack of consensus that the injury was even football related. Lekkas belatedly claimed a 50% salary bonus for having his career ended prematurely by injury, despite Hawthorn's offer of a new contract and his subsequent decision to retire as opposed to being delisted. Soccer career Lekkas was long a supporter of South Melbourne FC, even donating to help save the club from folding. After retiring from Australian rules football, Lekkas began training with South Melbourne in late 2005. During South Melbourne's 2005 season Lekkas was elevated into the senior list. Return to Australian rules After a period of disenchantment with the game, Angelo returned to work with the AFL in 2007 as part-time as a multicultural officer and AFL ambassador and also in a community liaison role at Hawthorn as part of the settlement with the club. In 2008, he signed with the Sunbury in the Ballarat Football League. He currently runs his own private sports tuition company.

Classification There are two main categories of immunostimulants: #Specific immunostimulants provide antigenic specificity in immune response, such as vaccines or any antigen. #Non-specific immunostimulants act irrespective of antigenic specificity to augment immune response of other antigen or stimulate components of the immune system without antigenic specificity, such as adjuvants and non-specific immunostimulators. =Non-specific= Many endogenous substances are non- specific immunostimulators. For example, female sex hormones are known to stimulate both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D. Some publications point towards the effect of deoxycholic acid (DCA) as an immunostimulant (English summary) of the non-specific immune system, activating its main actors, the macrophages. According to these publications, a sufficient amount of DCA in the human body corresponds to a good immune reaction of the non- specific immune system.

Fikret Amirov grew up in an atmosphere of Azerbaijani folk music. His father, Mashadi Jamil Amirov, was a famous mugam singer (\\"xan…ônd…ô\\") from Shusha, who played tar and composed, including the 1915 opera Seyfal mulk. During his childhood and early adolescence, Fikret began composing pieces for the piano. Upon his graduation from the Ganja Music College, Amirov entered the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire, now known as the Baku Music Academy, where he was a student of Boris Zeidman and Uzeyir Hajibeyov. In 1941, when Nazi Germany attacked the USSR, Amirov, 19 at the time, was drafted to the Soviet army. He was wounded near Voronezh, hospitalized and demobilized from the military service, returning to Baku to continue his studies at the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire. Amirov's music was strongly influenced by Azeri folk melodies. He created a new genre called symphonic mugam. Amirov's symphonic mugams were based on classical folk pieces and were performed by many renowned symphony orchestras throughout the world, such as the Houston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. Amirov was a prolific composer. His most famous pieces include symphonic works such as \\"Shur\\" (1946), Kurd Ovshari (1949), \\"Azerbaijan Capriccio\\" (1961), \\"Gulustan Bayati-Shiraz\\" (1968), \\"The Legend of Nasimi\\" (1977), \\"To the Memory of the Heroes of the Great National War\\" (1944), \\"Double Concerto for Violin, Piano and Orchestra\\" (1948) etc. His ballets include \\"Nizami\\" (1947) and Arabian Nights, which premiered in 1979. Amirov wrote the opera \\"Sevil\\" in 1953. He also wrote a number of pieces for the piano including \\"Ballad,\\" \\"Ashug's Song,\\" \\"Nocturne,\\" \\"Humoreska,\\" \\"Lyrical Dance,\\" \\"Waltz,\\" \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Toccata.\\" He also wrote numerous film scores. Michelle Kwan, World Champion Ice Skater from the U.S. used Fikret Amirov's symphonic piece \\"Gulustan Bayati-Shiraz\\" in her skating program \\"Taj Mahal\\" in 1996.  Life and career  Fikrat Amirov was born on November 22, 1922, in the family of Mashadi Jamil Amirov and Dyurdana khanim, Ganja city. He was the second child of the family. Fikret Amirov first started to play tar and accompany his sister, Yakhshi Khanim. Soon, with their performances, Fikret and his sister became successful in their school and attended the ‚ÄúChildren's Creative Olympics‚Äù took place in Ganja. During the event, he played tar to accompany his sister. Uzeyir Hajibeyli, who came to Ganja to choose talented performers gets acquainted with the talent. Fikret and his sister held the first place in the contest that took place in Ganja, and then in Baku. Shortly after, they move to Baku and Fikret entered Azerbaijan State Conservatoire (currently, Baku Music Academy). During their college years, they also performed at concerts with performances. Due to his success and talent, Fikret was taken to Baku after graduating from secondary school in 1939, Ganja. Here, he went to the conservatory with the advice of Dyrdana khanum (his mother). Young Fikret came to Baku to meet Bulbul and Bulbul introduced him to Uzeyir Hajibeyli here. Uzeyir Bey discovered his talent and advised him to study in the conservatory. Fikret Amirov resided at his relatives' home for the first time he visited Baku. Then with his violinist friend, they moved to a house in Dmitrov Street. After military service, he studied the subject \\"Basics of Azerbaijani Folk Music\\" in Uzeyir Hajibeyli's class and started to compose his first works in this style. Since 1930, the Folk Music Cabinet was organized in the conservatory in order to collect the folk songs and dances under the guidance of Uzeyir Hajibeyli and Bulbul. Bulbul, who led the cabinet, recruited young composers and musicians. They went on expeditions to various parts of the country, collected folklore samples and provided folk songs and dance music with musical notes including Jabbar Qaryagdioglu, Seyid Shushinski, Khan Shushinski, and others‚Äô works. Fikret Amirov was also attended in this project along with Asaf Zeynalli, Zakir Bagirov, Gara Garayev, Suleyman Alasgarov, Said Rustamov, Ashraf Abbasov, Midhat Ahmadov, Mammadsaleh Ismayilov. In 1940, frequent musical nights and concerts were held in the Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Hall. Fikret Amirov took part in these concerts and became more familiar with the works of Western and Russian composers, and used their musical language. He also attended in the symphonic orchestra exercises. During those years, Uzeyir Hajibayli was the main person who encouraged Fikret Amirov as a composer. Boris Zeydman also played a key role in the composer's career. I.G. Plyam who Fikrat's piano teacher wrote: I could hear how hard he worked every day. For hours and hours, he would go over each nuance elaborating each phrase. Students try to imitate others until they define their own way. Maybe that's only natural. But right from the start, Fikrat's work was original.\\" Amirov was involved with numerous responsibilities related to music. He directed the Azerbaijan Opera and Ballet Theater (1956-59), presided over the Azerbaijan Composers' Union in the 1960s and headed the Soviet Composers' Union during the 1970s. The wide artistic interest of Amirov included operas, ballets, symphonies, symphonic poems, symphonic mugham, suites, capriccio, piano concertos, sonatas, musical comedies, songs, love songs, piano pieces, music for dramatic productions, and movies. Amirov created the first Azerbaijani lyrical-psychological opera on a contemporary theme. Moreover, he is the author of the first instrumental concert and a fairytale ballet in Azerbaijan. The most outstanding works that made the musician well-known around the world are opera ‚ÄòSevil‚Äô as well as ballet ‚ÄòOne Thousand and One Night‚Äô created on the basis of oriental tales.  Participation in war  November 27, 1941, 19-year-old Fikrat Amirov was called up for conscription into Soviet army. He was enrolled in Tbilisi for 3 months to study at the communications courses. After finishing the course, he was sent to the Voronezh front on June 3, 1942. During those years, he also led an ensemble, and also learned to play in the mandolin, which is a Russian instrument. Fikrat Amirov got an early discharge from the military November 1942 due to the illness. He first came to Ganja and stayed here for about a year and continued his works. He worked in Ganja State Philharmonic and led the music school and together with Mehdi Mammadov, the main director at the Drama Theater. The composer's symphonic poem \\"The Memory of Heroes of the Great Patriotic War\\", written in 1943, also reflects his frontier impressions.  Style  His pieces was built on folk traditions of Azerbaijan and Middle East. However, the folkloric elements can be identified in them whether they are Azerbaijani or Arabic, as in the case of his ballet ‚ÄúArabian Nights,‚Äù his ‚ÄúConcerto on an Arabian Theme for the Piano and Orchestra‚Äù (together with Elmira Nazirova) and ‚ÄúThe Song of the Blind Arab‚Äù. As the composer used to do a lot of research before starting his pieces, strong folkloric elements can be observed in his compositions. For example, prior to composing his ballet \\"Arabian Nights,\\" he visited several Arabic countries-Iraq, Yemen and Egypt-and brought back tapes and records. His orchestral suites, based on the style of Azerbaijan Mugams often contain melodies that are reminiscent of Rimsky-Korsakov, Khachaturian and Turkish music. One of his early success outside the USSR was Kyurd Ovshar√Ø suite conducted by Leopold Stokowski.

Pinter's One for the Road is not to be confused with the Willy Russell play of the same name. Background One for the Road, considered Pinter's \\"statement about the human rights abuses of totalitarian governments\\", was inspired, according to Antonia Fraser, by reading on May 19, 1983, Jacobo Timerman's Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number, a book about torture on Argentina's military dictatorship; later, on January 1984, he got to write it after an argument with two Turkish girls at a family birthday party on the subject of torture. The year following the publication, Pinter would visit Turkey with Arthur Miller \\"to investigate allegations of the torture and persecution of Turkish writers\\"; as he explains further in his interview with Nicholas Hern, \\"A Play and Its Politics\\", conducted in February 1985 and published in 1985 in the revised and reset Eyre Methuen hardbackPinter 1985, pp. 5‚Äì23 and in 1986 in the Grove Evergreen paperbackPinter 1986, pp. 7‚Äì23 and illustrated with production photographs taken at the premiere by Ivan Kyncl, torture of political prisoners in countries like Turkey \\"is systematic\\".Pinter 1986, p. 13 Due to the tolerance and even support of such human rights abuses by the governments of Western countries like the United States, Pinter emphasizes (prophetically it turned out given later revelations about extraordinary rendition) in One for the Road how such abuses might happen in or at the direction of these democracies too. In this play the actual physical violence takes place off stage; Pinter indirectly dramatizes such terror and violence through verbal and non-verbal allusions to off-stage acts of repeated rape of Gila, physical mutilation of Victor, and the ultimate murder of their son, Nicky. The effects of the violence that takes place off stage are, however, portrayed verbally and non- verbally on stage. Though in the interview, Pinter says that he himself \\"always find[s] agitprop insulting and objectionable [‚Ä¶] now, of course I'm doing the same thing\\".Pinter 1986, p. 18 He observes that \\"when the play was done in New York, as the second part of a triple-bill [Other Places, directed by Alan Schneider, at the Manhattan Theatre Club (1984)], a goodly percentage of people left the theatre when it was over. They were asked why they were going and invariably they said, 'We know all about this. We don't need to be told.' Now, I believe that they were lying. They did not know about it and did not want to know\\". Setting The play takes place in \\"A room\\" in a house during the course of one day (\\"Morning\\", \\"Afternoon\\", and \\"Night\\"), but the location of the room is unspecified. The furniture in the room, a \\"desk\\" and a \\"machine\\" used as a telephone intercom, and the bars on the windows, as illustrated by the premiere production photographs, suggests that the room in a domestic house has been converted into an office and that the house functions as a prisonPinter 1986, p. 30 ff. The use of some common English colloquial expressions (e.g., the titular \\"One for the Road\\" repeated by Nicolas regarding having another drink) implies that the action could take place in Great Britain or America, or another English-speaking country among \\"civilised\\" people.Pinter 1986, p. 31 Synopsis Victor and his wife Gila, who have obviously been tortured, as their \\"clothes\\" are \\"torn\\" and they are \\"bruised\\",Pinter 1986, p. 31, 61 and their seven-year-old son, Nicky, are imprisoned in separate rooms of a house by a totalitarian regime represented by an officer named Nicolas. Though in control locally‚Äî\\"I can do absolutely anything I like\\"Pinter 1986, p. 33 ‚Äîhe is not the final arbiter of power, since he refers to outside sources to validate his actions: \\"Do you know the man who runs this country?\\";Pinter 1986, p. 47 \\"God speaks through me.\\"Pinter 1986, p. 36, 40 But the play reveals that Nicolas is insecure and that he overcompensates by aggressive gestures and words, threatening both Victor and Gila with a peculiar gesture, waving and jabbing his \\"big finger\\" and his \\"little finger [‚Ä¶] both at the same time\\" before their eyes;Pinter 1986, p. 33, 71 while he tries to converse with Victor as if they were both \\"civilised\\" men, he stresses gratuitously that \\"Everyone respects me here\\"Pinter 1986, p. 36 and invents depraved fantasies of having sex with a menstruating Gila,Pinter 1986, pp. 46‚Äì47 even ruminating perversely that she has \\"fallen in love\\" with him.Pinter 1986, p. 48‚Äì50 Pinter highlighted Nicolas' insecurities in his own performance of the role as directed by Robin Lef√®vre in 2001, adding stage business at the start; as Michael Billington describes in his review of a performance at the New Ambassadors Theatre, \\"In a long, silent prelude we see Nicolas psyching himself up for the ensuing ritual.\\" This page reprints the texts of some reviews, including Billington's in the Guardian of 4 July 2001, entitled \\"Pinter the Actor's Muscular Authority\\". When Nicolas confronts Gila, he refers to sexual torture of her that has taken and will continue to take place off stage: \\"Have they [my soldiers] been raping you? [‚Ä¶] How many times? How many times have you been raped? Pause. How many times?\\" [‚Ä¶] \\"How many times have you been raped?\\"Pinter 1986, pp. 70‚Äì71 Though Nicolas chats in an ostensibly-innocuous manner with Victor's and Gila's seven-year-old son Nicky about whether the child \\"Would like to be a soldier\\" when he grows up,Pinter 1986, p. 58 he bullies even the little boy: \\"You like soldiers. Good. But you spat at my soldiers and you kicked them. You attacked them.\\" After Nicky says, \\"I didn't like those soldiers\\", Nicolas replies menacingly: \\"They don't like you either, my darling.\\"Pinter 1986, p. 59 Victor's and Gila's specific \\"offences\\" (if there are any) go unnamed. Nicolas accuses Gila of mentioning her father when she responds to a question about where she met her husband by saying that she met him in \\"a room\\", in her \\"father's room\\"; Nicolas exaggerates this mere mention as if she were \\"to defame, to debase, the memory of [her dead] father\\"‚Äî\\"a wonderful man [‚Ä¶] a man of honour\\" whom he claims to have \\"loved [‚Ä¶] as if he were my own father\\".Pinter 1986, p. 66 In his final exchange with Victor, Nicolas' use of the past tense signifies that the soldiers have killed Nicky and portends his parents' similarly terrifying fate at their hands: \\"Your son. I wouldn't worry about him. He was a little prick\\" (italics added),Pinter 1986, p. 79 leading to Pinter's final stage directions, as Victor \\"straightens and stares at\\" Nicolas, followed by \\"Silence\\" and \\"Blackout.\\"Pinter 1986, p. 80 Characters *Nicolas Mid 40s *Gila 30 *Victor 30 *Nicky 7 Notable productions The Grove Press edition of the play lists eight foreign countries where the play had been staged by the time it went to press in 1985, with a list of 10 additional countries in which future productions were being planned.Pinter 1986, p. 26 Pinter's official website features a calendar of later productions, and the page devoted to One for the Road provides some hyperlinked foreign productions.One For The Road at =Premiere: The Lyric Studio, Hammersmith ‚Äì 1984 (13 March 1984)= :(Part of a double bill with Victoria Station:) Cast:Pinter 1986, p. 27 *Alan Bates (Nicolas) *Roger Lloyd- Pack (Victor) *Jenny Quayle (Gila) *Stephen Kember or Felix Yates (Nicky) Production team: *Harold Pinter, Director *Tim Bickerton, Designer *Dave Horn, Lighting =American premiere: Other Places, Manhattan Theatre Club, New York City, April 1984= :(Part of triple bill with Victoria Station and A Kind of Alaska) Cast: *Kevin Conway (Nicolas) *Greg Martyn (Victor) *David George Polyak (Nicky) *Caroline Lagerfelt (Gila) Production team: *Alan Schneider, Director *John Lee Beatty, Set design *Jess Goldstein, Costume design *Rocky Greenberg, Lighting design *Lynne Meadow, Artistic director *Barry Grove, Managing director =BBC-TV production, transmitted on 25 July 1985= Same cast as London premiere, except that Gila was played by Rosie Kerslake and Nicky by Paul Adams.

Malabar Coast moist forests The Malabar Coast moist forests is a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion of southwestern India. It lies along India's Konkan and Malabar coasts, in a narrow strip between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats range, which runs parallel to the coast. It has an area of , and extends from northern Maharashtra through Goa, Karnataka and Kerala to Kanniyakumari in southernmost Tamil Nadu. The ecoregion extends from sea level to the 250 metre contour of the Western Ghats. It is bounded on the east by the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests in Maharashtra and Karnataka, and the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests in Kerala. Very little of the natural vegetation of the ecoregion remains; it has largely been cleared for agriculture, grazing, and teak plantations. South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests The South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests is a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion of southern India. It covers the southern portion of the Western Ghats range and the Nilgiri Hills between 250 and 1000 metres elevation in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states. = Geography = The ecoregion has an area of . It includes the southern ranges of the Western Ghats, including the Agastyamalai and Anamalai, and the eastward spurs of the Nilgiri Hills and Palni Hills. The forests of Wayanad in northern Kerala mark the transition to the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests to the north. To the west, the Malabar Coast moist forests ecoregion lies in the coastal strip between the 250 meter contour and the Malabar Coast. To the east, the ecoregion transitions to the South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests ecoregion in the drier rain shadow of the Western Ghats. It surrounds the South Western Ghats montane rain forests ecoregion, which lies above 1000 metres elevation. South Western Ghats montane rain forests The South Western Ghats montane rain forests are an ecoregion of southern India, covering the southern portion of the Western Ghats range in Karnataka Kerala and Tamil Nadu, at elevations over 1000 meters. They are cooler and wetter than the lower-elevation South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, which surround the montane rain forests. = Geography = The ecoregion covers an area of . It is estimated that two-thirds of the original forests have been cleared, and only 3,200 square kilometres, or 13% of the intact area, is protected. The southern portion of the Western Ghats contains the highest peaks in the range, notably Anai Mudi in Kerala, at 2695 meters elevation. The Ghats intercept the moisture-laden monsoon winds off the Arabian Sea, and the average annual precipitation exceeds 2,800 mm. The northeast monsoon from October to November supplements the June to September southwest monsoon. The South Western Ghats are the wettest portion of peninsular India, and are surrounded by drier ecoregions to the east and north. = Flora = The ecoregion is the most species-rich in peninsular India, and is home to numerous endemic species. The cool and moist climate, high rainfall, and variety of microclimates brought about by differences in elevation and exposure supports lush and diverse forests; 35% of the plant species are endemic to the ecoregion. Moist evergreen montane forests are the predominant habitat type. The montane evergreen forests support a great diversity of species. The trees generally form a canopy at 15 to 20 m, and the forests are multistoried and rich in epiphytes, especially orchids. Characteristic canopy trees are Cullenia exarillata, Mesua ferrea, Palaquium ellipticum, Gluta travancorica, and Nageia wallichiana. Nageia is a podocarp conifer with origins in the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, of which India was formerly part, and a number of other plants in the ecoregion have Gondwana origins. Other evergreen tree species of the montane forest include Calophyllum austroindicum, Garcinia rubro-echinata, Garcinia travancorica, Diospyros barberi, Memecylon subramanii, Memecylon gracile, Goniothalamus rhyncantherus, and Vernonia travancorica. The other major habitat type in the ecoregion is the shola- grassland complex, found at elevations of 1,900 to 2,220 m. Shola is a stunted forest, with an upper story of small trees, generally Pygeum gardneri, Schefflera racemosa, Linociera ramiflora, Syzygium spp., Rhododendron nilgiricum, Mahonia nepalensis, Elaeocarpus recurvatus, Ilex denticulata, Michelia nilagirica, Actinodaphne bourdellonii, and Litsea wightiana. Below the upper story is a low understory and a dense shrub layer. These shola forests are interspersed with montane grasslands, characterized by frost- and fire-resistant grass species like Chrysopogon zeylanicus, Cymbopogon flexuosus, Arundinella ciliata, Arundinella mesophylla, Arundinella tuberculata, Themeda tremula, and Sehima nervosum. = Fauna = The ecoregion also supports a rich fauna, which is also high in endemism: of 78 mammal species, 10 are endemic, along with 42% of the fishes, 48% of the reptiles, and 75% of the amphibians. Of 309 bird species, 13 are endemic. The ecoregion supports India's largest elephant population, along with populations of threatened tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), gaur (Bos gaurus), and wild dog (Cuon alpinus). The rare and endemic Nilgiri tahr (Hemitragus hylocrius) is limited to a 400 km band of shola-grassland mosaic, from the Nilgiri Hills in the north to the Ashambu Hills in the south. The lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) and Nilgiri macaque (Semnopithecus johnii) are endangered endemic primate species. 90 of India's 484 reptile species are endemic to the ecoregion, with eight endemic genera (Brachyophidium, Dravidogecko, Melanophidium, Plectrurus, Ristella, Salea, Teretrurus, and Xylophis). Almost 50% of India's 206 amphibian species are endemic to the ecoregion, with six endemic genera (Indotyphlus, Melanobatrachus, Nannobatrachus, Nyctibatrachus, Ranixalus, and Uraeotyphlus). = Protected areas = As of 1997, 13 protected areas had been designated, covering an area of over 3,200 km¬≤. * Pushpagiri (60 km¬≤) * Talakaveri (250 km¬≤) * Brahmagiri (190 km¬≤) * Aralam (50 km¬≤) * Karimpuzha (230 km¬≤) * Mukurthi National Park, Tamil Nadu (60 km¬≤) * Silent Valley National Park, Kerala (110 km¬≤) * Meghamalai (120 km¬≤) * Periyar National Park, Kerala (540 km¬≤) * Anamalai (600 km¬≤) * Eravikulam National Park, Kerala (97 km¬≤) * Parambikulam (260 km¬≤) * Idukki (80 km¬≤) * Shenduruny (300 km¬≤) * Kalakad- Mundanthurai (290 km¬≤) * Peppara (40 km¬≤) See also * Malabar (Northern Kerala) * North Malabar Category:Ecoregions of India ","title":"Malabar rainforests"},{"id":"2993504","text":"In mathematics, a Kloosterman sum is a particular kind of exponential sum.

Zeit. 34 (1931‚Äì32) pp. 91‚Äì109. and there are many simple proofs in the literature.Williams, Kenneth S. Note on the Kloosterman sum, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 30(1), pages: 61‚Äì62, (1971). Estimates Because Kloosterman sums occur in the Fourier expansion of modular forms, estimates for Kloosterman sums yield estimates for Fourier coefficients of modular forms as well. The most famous estimate is due to Andr√© Weil and states: : K(a,b;m)\\\\leq \\\\tau(m) \\\\sqrt{\\\\gcd(a,b,m)} \\\\sqrt{m}. Here \\\\tau(m) is the number of positive divisors of . Because of the multiplicative properties of Kloosterman sums these estimates may be reduced to the case where is a prime number . A fundamental technique of Weil reduces the estimate :K(a,b;p)\\\\leq 2 \\\\sqrt{p}, when ab ‚â† 0 to his results on local zeta-functions. Geometrically the sum is taken along a 'hyperbola' XY = ab and we consider this as defining an algebraic curve over the finite field with elements. This curve has a ramified Artin‚ÄìSchreier covering , and Weil showed that the local zeta-function of has a factorization; this is the Artin L-function theory for the case of global fields that are function fields, for which Weil gives a 1938 paper of J. Weissinger as reference (the next year he gave a 1935 paper of Hasse as earlier reference for the idea; given Weil's rather denigratory remark on the abilities of analytic number theorists to work out this example themselves, in his Collected Papers, these ideas were presumably 'folklore' of quite long standing). The non-polar factors are of type , where is a Kloosterman sum. The estimate then follows from Weil's basic work of 1940. This technique in fact shows much more generally that complete exponential sums 'along' algebraic varieties have good estimates, depending on the Weil conjectures in dimension > 1. It has been pushed much further by Pierre Deligne, G√©rard Laumon, and Nicholas Katz.  Short Kloosterman sums  Short Kloosterman sums are defined as trigonometric sums of the form : \\\\sum_{n\\\\in A}\\\\exp \\\\left (2\\\\pi i \\\\frac{an^*+bn}{m} \\\\right), where runs through a set of numbers, coprime to , the number of elements \\\\A\\\\ in which is essentially smaller than , and the symbol n^* denotes the congruence class, inverse to modulo : nn^*\\\\equiv 1 \\\\bmod m. Up to the early 1990s, estimates for sums of this type were known mainly in the case where the number of summands was greater than . Such estimates were due to H. D. Kloosterman, I. M. Vinogradov, H. Salie, L. Carlitz, S. Uchiyama and A. Weil. The only exceptions were the special modules of the form , where is a fixed prime and the exponent increases to infinity (this case was studied by A.G. Postnikov by means of the method of Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov). In the 1990s Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba developed a new method of estimating short Kloosterman sums. Karatsuba's method makes it possible to estimate Kloosterman's sums, the number of summands in which does not exceed m^{\\\\varepsilon}, and in some cases even \\\\exp\\\\\\\\{(\\\\ln m)^{2/3+\\\\varepsilon}\\\\\\\\}, where \\\\varepsilon > 0 is an arbitrarily small fixed number. The last paper of A.A. Karatsuba on this subject was published after his death. Various aspects of the method of Karatsuba found applications in solving the following problems of analytic number theory: * finding asymptotics of the sums of fractional parts of the form: ::{\\\\sum_{n\\\\le x}}'\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{an^*+bn}{m}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, {\\\\sum_{p\\\\le x}}'\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{ap^*+bp}{m}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :where runs, one after another, through the integers satisfying the condition (n,m)=1, and runs through the primes that do not divide the module (A.A.Karatsuba); * finding the lower bound for the number of solutions of the inequalities of the form: ::\\\\alpha<\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{an^*+bn}{m}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\le\\\\beta :in the integers , coprime to , x<\\\\sqrt{m} (A.A. Karatsuba); * the precision of approximation of an arbitrary real number in the segment by fractional parts of the form: ::\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{an^*+bn}{m}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :where 1\\\\le n\\\\le x, (n,m)=1, x<\\\\sqrt{m} (A.A. Karatsuba); * a more precise constant in the Brun‚ÄìTitchmarsh theorem : ::\\\\pi(x;q,l)< \\\\frac{cx}{\\\\varphi(q)\\\\ln\\\\frac{2x}{q}}, :where \\\\pi(x;q,l) is the number of primes , not exceeding and belonging to the arithmetic progression p\\\\equiv l \\\\bmod{q} (J. Friedlander, H. Iwaniec); * a lower bound for the greatest prime divisor of the product of numbers of the form: .(D. R. Heath- Brown); * proving that there are infinitely many primes of the form: .(J. Friedlander, H. Iwaniec); * combinatorial properties of the set of numbers (A.A.Glibichuk): ::n^* \\\\bmod{m}, 1 \\\\le n \\\\le m^{\\\\varepsilon}. Lifting of Kloosterman sums Although the Kloosterman sums may not be calculated in general they may be \\"lifted\\" to algebraic number fields, which often yields more convenient formulas. Let \\\\tau be a squarefree integer with \\\\gcd(\\\\tau,m)=1. Assume that for any prime factor of we have : \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\tau}{p}\\\\right)=-1. Then for all integers a, b coprime to we have :K(a,b; m) = (-1)^{\\\\Omega(m)} \\\\sum_{\\\\stackrel{v, w \\\\bmod m}{v^2-\\\\tau w^2 \\\\equiv ab\\\\bmod m}} e^{\\\\frac{4\\\\pi i v}{m}}. Here is the number of prime factors of counting multiplicity. The sum on the right can be reinterpreted as a sum over algebraic integers in the field \\\\Q(\\\\sqrt{\\\\tau}).

Kuznetsov trace formula The Kuznetsov or relative trace formula connects Kloosterman sums at a deep level with the spectral theory of automorphic forms. Originally this could have been stated as follows. Let g: \\\\R\\\\to \\\\R be a sufficiently \\"well behaved\\" function. Then one calls identities of the following type Kuznetsov trace formula: :\\\\sum_{c\\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod N} c^{-r} K(m,n,c) g\\\\left(\\\\frac{4\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{mn}}{c}\\\\right) = \\\\text{ Integral transform }\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\text{ Spectral terms}. The integral transform part is some integral transform of g and the spectral part is a sum of Fourier coefficients, taken over spaces of holomorphic and non-holomorphic modular forms twisted with some integral transform of g. The Kuznetsov trace formula was found by Kuznetsov while studying the growth of weight zero automorphic functions.N. V. Kuznecov, Petersson's conjecture for forms of weight zero and Linnik's conjecture. Sums of Kloosterman sums, Mathematics of the USSR-Sbornik 39(3), (1981). Using estimates on Kloosterman sums he was able to derive estimates for Fourier coefficients of modular forms in cases where Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures was not applicable. It was later translated by Jacquet to a representation theoretic framework. Let be a reductive group over a number field F and H\\\\subset G be a subgroup. While the usual trace formula studies the harmonic analysis on G, the relative trace formula a tool for studying the harmonic analysis on the symmetric space . For an overview and numerous applications see the references.Cogdell, J.W. and I. Piatetski-Shapiro, The arithmetic and spectral analysis of Poincar√© series, volume 13 of Perspectives in mathematics. Academic Press Inc., Boston, MA, (1990). History Weil's estimate can now be studied in W. M. Schmidt, Equations over finite fields: an elementary approach, 2nd ed. (Kendrick Press, 2004). The underlying ideas here are due to S. Stepanov and draw inspiration from Axel Thue's work in Diophantine approximation. There are many connections between Kloosterman sums and modular forms. In fact the sums first appeared (minus the name) in a 1912 paper of Henri Poincar√© on modular forms. Hans Sali√© introduced a form of Kloosterman sum that is twisted by a Dirichlet character:Lidl & Niederreiter (1997) p.253 Such Sali√© sums have an elementary evaluation. After the discovery of important formulae connecting Kloosterman sums with non-holomorphic modular forms by Kuznetsov in 1979, which contained some 'savings on average' over the square root estimate, there were further developments by Iwaniec and Deshouillers in a seminal paper in Inventiones Mathematicae (1982). Subsequent applications to analytic number theory were worked out by a number of authors, particularly Bombieri, Fouvry, Friedlander and Iwaniec. The field remains somewhat inaccessible. A detailed introduction to the spectral theory needed to understand the Kuznetsov formulae is given in R. C. Baker, Kloosterman Sums and Maass Forms, vol. I (Kendrick press, 2003). Also relevant for students and researchers interested in the field is .

It is positioned 1000 metres above sea level on the north side of the Troodos mountain range, at the foot of Mount Papoutsa. Ioannis Constantinou is the president of the Community Council of Askas. Askas, like all the villages of the area, has gone through fluctuations of its population. In 1881 its inhabitants numbered 142, increasing to 333 in 1911, and to 439 in 1946. In 1960 the population decreased to 363, and to 321 in 1982. In the 2001 census the village numbered 187 inhabitants. The village lies close to the Nicosia - Limassol administrative borders, having a distance of about 50 kilometres from Nicosia and just two kilometres west of Palaichori Morphou, receiving an Average annual rainfall is of about 800 millimetres. In this region mainly are cultivated vines of the wine-making variety, vegetables, hazel, walnut, and olive trees, fruit-trees, almond trees, and forage plants. The village is connected via road to Palaichori in the east and from there on to Nicosia, to Agros in the south-west, and to Alona, Cyprus, Polystypos, and Kyperounta in the west. The houses, apart from the recent ones, are traditionally built entirely with local materials: the stone, the clay, and the pinewood from the surrounding mountains. The roofs have tiles, all \\"kneaded\\" and \\"baked\\" locally. The village's history is lost in the depths of time. No one knows exactly when the village was built and when it was first inhabited. One specific testimony is a date found on the front of an internal door, in the basement of Theofanis's house where the earthenware jars were kept. It was covered with a thin layer of clay. However, one day someone leaned on it with his hand and the clay fell off, revealing the date 1381. This indicates that the village was in existence during the Frank Domination era, without that meaning it did not exist before that. There are two churches in the village. One is church Timios Prodromos, dedicated to the Holy Baptist (John) and the other is the Church of Timios Stavros, dedicated to the Holy Cross. There is also the country church of \\"Agia Christina\\" that today is called the country church of \\"Agia Paraskevi\\". The village -under its present name -was not included in the list of Lusignan - Venetian feuds and royal estates of Mas Latri. However, it is most probable that the \\"Asta\\" settlement that is found marked in the Venetian maps is Askas. According to one version, the village's name is due to its first settler who was a skin-bag maker. Another version reports that it took its name from a medieval family of nobles that was surnamed Askas.

It currently has 65 stores locally and has had several stores in New Zealand and Hong Kong.http://www.dymocks.com.hk/ History  The first Dymocks bookstore was opened in Sydney by William Dymock in 1879, in Market Street. As his business grew over the years, he moved to larger premises at 428 George Street, traded as Dymock's Book Arcade, and eventually had a million books in stock. As he had died childless and unmarried, the business passed to his sister, Marjory, who was married to John Forsyth. Since then, the Forsyth family has managed Dymocks. In 1922, the Dymock family purchased the site of the old Royal Hotel in George Street, and built the historic, Art Deco landmark Dymocks building, completed in 1930. In 1986 the bookstore chain was established as a franchise chain, and has since opened stores in every mainland Australian state, and also internationally in New Zealand and Singapore. In 1999, Dymocks Booksellers entered into a joint venture with South China Morning Post (Holdings) to set up Dymocks Franchise Systems (China), in order to expand the Dymocks chain into Hong Kong. =Hong Kong= The first store with the Dymocks brand opened at the Star Ferry concourse in Central in 1999. Three Dymocks stores closed in 2012 in Hong Kong when their rental contracts expired. It was announced in January 2015 that Dymocks would close its flagship IFC MALL store on 25 January, and that it would subsequently close its Hong Kong office. After the closure of the IFC Mall store, the number of Dymocks stores in Hong Kong would be brought down to five. The remaining stores are expected to operate independently using the Dymocks name before being rebranded individually. Dymocks in the 21st century In addition to stocking music CDs, DVDs and other related items, Dymocks now has an online store launched in late 2006 in response to the increasing penetration into the Australian book market of online retailers such as Amazon. Dymocks has a comprehensive multi-channel strategy including an international retail network of approximately 65 stores in Australia: an online website, loyalty program, regular catalogues and social media. Dymocks also runs an Australia-wide program, Dymocks Children's Charities (DCC), providing books to pre-primary and primary school age children. Dymocks is the largest bookseller in Australia and currently holds close to 20% of the Australian book market. In 2009, Dymocks acquired an 80% equity stake in the Australian owned and operated Healthy Habits sandwich bar franchise for an undisclosed sum. In 2015, Dymocks Holdings PTY LTD acquired Telegram Paper Goods. Founded in 2008, Telegram Paper Goods distributes designer stationery brands across Australia and New Zealand. Telegram is best known for its online stationery store, Milligram (formerly Notemaker.com.au), that sells eclectic and designer stationery, cards, wrap, diaries, journals, and fine writing instruments. Loyalty program  Dymocks has a loyalty program called 'Dymocks Booklover Rewards', originally launched in 2001, and relaunched in 2006.

Owned and operated by Pacific Star Network, it broadcasts a sports radio format from Lower Plenty to Greater Melbourne. First broadcast on 29 November 1931 as 3AK, the station currently broadcasts from studios in South Melbourne alongside sister station 3MP. History The station first broadcast on 29 November 1931 as 3AK. In October 2003, amid growing debt and struggling ratings, 3AK operators Data & Commerce Limited placed the station up for sale. In November, owners Data & Commerce Limited entered into a lease with the newly-formed Sports Entertainment Network to create SEN 1116, a 24-hour sports radio station. Headed by managing director Danny Staffieri, formerly of FIVEaa, the new station was promoted as 'entertaining radio with a sports focus', and would rival horse racing station Sport 927. On 19 January 2004, SEN 1116 launched onto Melbourne's airwaves, with former AFL footballers Garry Lyon, Tim Watson and Billy Brownless heading the station's \\"Morning Glory\\" breakfast show, Richmond Football Club premiership player Kevin Bartlett in mornings, ABC Radio National's Francis Leach in afternoons, and Dermott Brereton and Anthony Hudson in drive. In the year's first radio ratings survey, the station jumped from reaching 1.2% of the Melbourne radio market as 3AK, to 2.1% as SEN, growing to 2.8% in the year's fourth survey despite the lack of coverage of any major sports. However, in July, the station secured broadcast rights to the 2004 Summer Olympics, alongside 2GB, 2CC, FIVEaa, 6iX, HO-FM and Hot 100, among others. SEN also carried coverage of the 2004 NRL Grand Final from 2GB, and the 2004‚Äì05 FA Premier League from BBC Radio 5 Live. In December 2004, the SEN brand was revealed to be expanded into Adelaide, with Sports Entertainment Network leasing news talk 5DN from Australian Radio Network to create SEN 1323. Launching on 1 February 2005, the station became a simulcast of its Melbourne sister station, with only one Adelaide-based programme - \\"The Boys Next Door\\", hosted by former FIVEaa presenter Mark Aiston, The Sunday Footy Show panelist Mark Bickley and Port Adelaide Football Club ruckman Matthew Primus. However, while the station remained flat in Melbourne, ratings dwindled in Adelaide; despite gaining coverage of the New Zealand cricket tour of Australia and the 2005 VFL season, Sports Entertainment Network entered voluntary administration, citing $3.5 million in losses. The SEN 1323 lease was cancelled, resulting in ARN launching easy listening-format Cruise 1323. The Melbourne station was sold back to Pacific Star Network, the renamed Data & Commerce Limited. =2010s= In July 2015, the newsroom shared between SEN and sister station 3MP 1377 was closed, replaced with the Victorian news service from Macquarie National News, based at 3AW. In November 2015, it was announced that Francis Leach would depart ABC Grandstand Digital following the axing of the Grandstand Breakfast programme, and will again join SEN, hosting SEN Breakfast alongside David ‚ÄúThe Ox‚Äù Schwarz to replace The Morning Glory. Current co-host Andy Maher will move to afternoons, launching SEN Lunch Break, moving Daniel Harford into drive with Mark Allen. Andrew Gaze and Tim Watson, while losing regular timeslots, would remain with the station as a contributor. In January 2018, the station's schedule was again refreshed. Former ABC commentator Gerard Whateley joined the station as chief sports caller and mornings presenter, with Kevin Bartlett moving to the drive show following the departure of Harford. In April 2018, parent company Pacific Star Network merged with sports media business Crocmedia, most notable for producing the AFL Nation broadcast call heard across regional Australia.

As the port of Gythium was an important Spartan base, the allies decided to capture it before they advanced inland to Sparta. The Romans and the Achaeans were joined outside the city by the Pergamese and Rhodian fleets. The Spartans held out, but one of the joint commanders, Dexagoridas, decided to surrender the city to the Roman legate. When Gorgopas, the other commander, found out, he killed Dexagoridas and took sole command of the city. After Dexagoridas' murder, the Spartans held out more vigorously. However, Titus Quinctius Flamininus of the allied forces arrived with 4,000 more men and the Spartans decided to surrender the city on the condition that the garrison could leave unharmed. The result of this siege forced Nabis, the tyrant of Sparta, to abandon the surrounding land and withdraw to the city of Sparta. Later that year, Sparta capitulated to the allies. Prelude The Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC which left the Spartans in control of Argos. This Spartan gain was a setback for the Achaean League who had been trying to incorporate Sparta into their league for many years. The Romans had won the Second Macedonian War and it left them in control of Greek affairs. However, they decided not to occupy Greece but to garrison some cities for five years.Livy, Rome and the Mediterranean, 125 The tyrant of Sparta, Nabis, who had declared himself king, was troubling the Achaean League and was also threatening to destroy the peace in Greece. In 195 BC, Flamininus summoned his army in Greece and that of his allies at Plataea in Boeotia. He then marched from Plataea to Argos where he was joined by 10,000 Achean infantry and 1,000 cavalry.Livy, Rome and the Mediterranean, 164 After a few brief skirmishes, the allies decided to abandon the siege and they pitched in Tegea.Livy, Rome and the Mediterranean, 165 They then advanced upon Caryae where they were joined by 1,500 Macedonians and 400 Thessalian cavalry. Nabis also made his own preparations. Nabis had always been on good terms with Cretan leaders and he requested 1,000 of their best soldiers who were hand picked to assist him. As well as the Cretans, he hired 3,000 mercenaries and 10,000 citizens.Livy, Rome and the Mediterranean, 166 The Romans and their allies then advanced upon Sellasia not far north of Sparta. The Romans were defeated in a small battle and they retreated. The Romans then won another battle against the Spartans and forced them to retreat into the city.Livy, Rome and the Mediterranean, 168 Siege Some coastal cities surrendered to the Romans which allowed them to have a base in the coastal regions of Laconia. Gythium was a large city and had been made by the Spartans as their main port and naval arsenal. The Romans advanced upon the city and they were joined there by the combined Rhodian and Pergamese fleets. The sailors from the Roman, Pergamese, and Rhodian fleets built siege engines which had devastating effects on the walls. One of the city's joint commanders, Dexagoridas, offered to surrender the city to the Roman legate in charge of the fleet while Flamininus was gone. When the other commander Gorgopas found out, he murdered Dexagoridas. Macedonia and the Aegean world. Now with the city under Gorgopas' command the defenders became reinvigorated. The siege was proving more difficult until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 Roman soldiers.Livy, Rome and the Mediterranean, 169 With the arrival of the new soldiers, the allied soldiers were encouraged and began bombarding the city again with their siege engines while the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet continued to put pressure on the Spartans from the sea. The Spartans knew that they did not have much of a chance of withstanding the renewed allied assault and Gorgopas decided to surrender the city to the Romans under the condition that the garrison was allowed to leave the city unharmed. Aftermath When Nabis found out that Gythium had fallen to the allies he decided to abandon the remaining Laconian countryside that he controlled. Nabis sent envoys to Flamininus who offered Nabis a parley. The Romans attacked Sparta when the parley ended but the Spartans withstood the initial allied assaults. Nabis, however, seeing that the situation was hopeless, agreed to surrender the city to the Romans.Livy, Rome and the Mediterranean, 175 The Romans forced Nabis to abandon Argos and most of the coastal cities of Laconia.Livy, Rome and the Mediterranean, 176 The Romans formed all the cities that had broken off from Sparta on the Laconian coast into the Union of Free Laconians.Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos.

Alexander to Actium:The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age.,423 Nabis attacked Gythium two or three years later only to retreat after being unable to capture the city but in 192 BC he was assassinated by the Aetolians before he had a chance to attempt another attack on the city. In 189 BC, the Spartans, having been deprived of a port, attacked and captured the city of Las. The Acheans, threatened by the attack, demanded the surrender of those responsible for the attack and when that was refused they captured the city.Livy, Rome and the Mediterranean, 365 Notes References =Primary Sources= *Livy.

After spending a year with the Lions, Emblen was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers for ¬£600,000, where he would become a regular during his three years at Molineux. A ¬£2,000,000 move to Crystal Palace beckoned in 1997 but would last just one season, and in 1998, after scoring two goals for Palace in the FA Cup against Scunthorpe United, Emblen moved back to Wolves in exchange for the West Midlands club writing off the remainder of the ¬£2million still owed as part of the initial transfer. Emblen's second three-year spell saw him gain favour with the Wolves fans as he made the attacking midfield role his own. It ended in 2001 when he moved to Norwich City for ¬£500,000. Emblen started just six games in a two-year spell with the Canaries because of chronic knee injury problems and spent the last few months of his contract on loan to Walsall (in two separate spells), whom he joined permanently on a two-year deal in June 2003. Upon leaving Walsall in 2005, Emblen moved to New Zealand to join the now-defunct New Zealand Knights. After the Knights ceased playing, Emblen moved to Waitakere United. Coaching career He was appointed player-coach of Waitakere United from 2009 to 2012, winning three successive ASB Premiership titles during his time at the club. In 2013, he was appointed in the same role at Western Springs, taking them from the Lotto Sport Italia NRFL Division 2 to the Lotto Sport Italia NRFL Premier within two years. In 2012, he managed the New Zealand team at the London Olympics. In 2014, he was named as the New Zealand interim head coach, taking charge of two matches; a 4‚Äì2 loss to Japan and a goalless draw with South Africa. In February 2018 he was appointed by Anthony Hudson as assistant coach of Colorado Rapids where is still one of the assistant coaches currently. Personal life His brother, Paul Emblen, was also a professional footballer, playing for Charlton Athletic and Wycombe Wanderers.

It is the capital city of Jigawa State. It is home to Federal University, Dutse established in November 2011. In addition to the Federal University Dutse, there is also a Research Institute for Date Palm (Sub-Station) and state polytechnic in Dutse. The Jigawa State Polytechnic has its College of Business and Management Studies at Dutse.  Geography and landscape  With an estimated population of 153,000 (2009), Dutse is currently the largest city in Jigawa State followed by Hadejia (111,000), Gumel (43,000), and Birnin Kudu (27,000). Dutse is the capital of Jigawa state of Nigeria. The state was created in 1991 during the military regime of General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. Dutse (Dutsi, in earlier notes) got its name from the rocky topography peculiar to the area. Different forms of rocks can be seen widely spread across the town. Mostly igneous in nature, the rocky town got its name from this naturally endowed resources, Dutse (Hausa term for rock). Dutse and its environ are well known for Date Trees (Dabino) of different variety. The area is characterised with undulating topography and hilly walls. The name Jigawa (from Jigayi) is attributed to such topology. Peculiar to the North- Western states, the population of Dutse are predominantly Hausa and Fulani. With availability of agrarian land, the inhabitants of Dutse are predominantly farmers; other occupations typical to rural area are also available among the populace. State creation The agitation for the creation of Jigawa state was chaired by Malam Inuwa-Dutse, former commissioner of Agriculture and Natural Resources in the old Kano State (comprising present Kano and Jigawa states) during late Alhaji Audu Bako governorship. It started in the late-1970s but it was curtailed as result of military coup. There was renewed interest at different times since the first call. When the call for states creation resurfaced in the late-1980s, Jigawa people were not hesitant to lend their voices. The victorious moment came in the early-1990s (August, 1991, precisely) during the military regime of President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. Although the call for state creation was won, majority of the constituting local governments submitted in the original report for the creation of the state were phased out and new ones were introduced. Some of the areas left out include Albasu, Ajingi, Wudil, Sumaila, Kachako and Takai. Only few among those that agitated for such state creation were actually in the New World (Jigawa state, Tarin Allah as a common slogan for the state).

Old Ras was one of the first capitals of the medieval Serbian state of Ra≈°ka, and the most important one for quite a long period of time. Located in today's region of Ra≈°ka, the city was positioned in the center of the early medieval state. Its favorable position in the area known as Old Serbia, along the Ra≈°ka gorge, on the crossroads and trading routes between neighbouring regions of Zeta and Bosnia in the west and Kosovo and Metohija in the south, added to its importance as a city. Today the fortress of Arsa lies in mostly unenclosed and unprotected ruins. However, there are plans for future reconstruction of the site. In the close vicinity of Arsa there is impressive group of medieval monuments consisting of fortresses, old market-places, churches and monasteries. Serbian medieval Monastery of Sopoƒáani near Arsa is a reminder of the contacts between Western world and the Byzantine world. The site of Stari Ras, in combination with the nearby Monastery of Sopoƒáani, is already a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Stari Ras monastery (12th century) is being reconstructed and it too may be included on the UNESCO World Heritage List with the site. Stari Ras and Sopoƒáani World Heritage site is not far from another UNESCO World Heritage Site of Serbia, the magnificent medieval monastery and churches of Studenica. The 6th century Church of Saint Apostles Peter and Paul is one of the oldest early medieval churches in Serbia. Stari Ras was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. History Archeological findings of fortified structures and early churches from the area of Stari Ras, dated from 4th to 6th century, correspond to testimony of Byzantine historian Procopius who wrote that Roman castellum of Arsa in the province of Dardania was refortified during the reign of emperor Justinian I (527-565). p. 216 The Slavic toponym Ras derives from Arsa via metathesis. A bishopric which cover parts of Serbia was founded probably in Ras in the time of major ecclesiastical events that took place around the Council of Constantinople in 869-870 and the Council of Constantinople in 879‚Äì880. p. 67-68, 208-209 The 10th century De Administrando Imperio mentions Rasa as a border area between Bulgaria and Serbia at the end of the 9th century. Newer research indicates that in the late 9th century it was part of the First Bulgarian Empire. From that period onwards, it changed rulers several times. Byzantine Emperor John Tzimiskes re-established control of Ras in 971 and founded the Catepanate of Ras. The seal of protospatharios John of Ras has been found from that era. By 976, the Bulgarian state had regained Ras, but Basil II recaptured it about 40 years later in 1016-18. In the imperial charters of Basil II from 1019 and 1020, rights and jurisdictions of the autonomous Archbishopric of Ohrid were established. One of the bishoprics in its jurisdiction was that of Ras, with the seat at the Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul. It remained a Byzantine frontier area until John II Komnenos lost the area as a result of the Byzantine‚ÄìHungarian War (1127‚Äì1129). The fortress of Ras was then burnt by the Serbian army. Its last commander was a Kritoplos who was then punished by Emperor for the fall of the fortress. In the next war (1149‚Äì51) the Byzantines seized Ras again. A late 12th-century cave monastery existed in the region north of the Studenica monastery. During the 14th century there was an important market-place below the Stari Ras, Trgovi≈°te, that started to develop. By the mid-15th century, in the time of the final Ottoman conquest of the region, another market-place was developing some 11 km to the east. The older place was known as Staro Trgovi≈°te (\\"old market-place\\", in Turkish: Eski Pazar) and younger as Novo Trgovi≈°te (\\"new market-place\\", Turkish: Yeni Pazar). The latter developed into the modern city of Novi Pazar.

The competition is most prominent in Australia, but is slowly expanding to other countries. The program runs through the third school term, commonly commencing in the first week back at school. Teams of students work to solve problems in one of four disciplines, these being: The Arts, Language-literature, S.T.E.M, and Social Sciences. Students form teams of seven and work together to solve both spontaneous and long term challenges. There are two divisions, primary and senior, with the primary division finishing in year 6 (Year 7 in some states), and the secondary division finishing at year 10. Students in years 11 and 12 often assist the teams at their schools as coaches, and practice spontaneous challenges with the students. The long term challenge is prepared by the students over five weeks, with minimal assistance from teachers or parents. The students receive an outline of the challenge and present their solution to the problem five weeks later at a regional competition. The solution takes the form of a dramatic production, with all costumes and props being created by the students with a strict $75 budget. The spontaneous challenge is a very different aspect of the competition, where the students are judged on their lateral thinking processes and their ability to communicate effectively and work together as a team. The challenge is spoken to the team and they are given between three and five minutes preparation time, in which they are judged on their effective use of time and creativity of their ideas, amongst other criteria. They are then given one or two minutes to present the solution. No marks are awarded for presentation. The scoring for the competition is a mixture of the long-term and spontaneous challenges. The team that scored the highest in each division, progresses to the state finals. Some states (such as South Australia) do not have a state final, and all schools in the state compete in the first round. The eight winning teams from each state then progress to the national finals, held in a different prominent Australian city each year. The state and national finals are held slightly differently to the regional competitions. The teams are given three hours to prepare their long-term challenge, as opposed to six weeks. Aside from the difference in time, the challenges are fundamentally similar. The teams still must also complete a spontaneous challenge. The Tournament is designed to encourage lateral thinking, creativity and teamwork skills in young people around Australia and the Pacific region. The tournament has been embraced by many schools throughout the region, providing their students with a different approach to learning and giving them useful skills in communication.

Its most popular series was an officially licensed series of figurines based on the Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett. The company was founded in 1980 by Bernard and Isobel Pearson, and acquired the rights to make Discworld figurines in 1990. In 1993, Clarecraft was purchased by Sally Couch and Trish Baker. It is one of the few large scale vendors of Discworld merchandise, along with Stephen Briggs, Paul Kidby, and the Discworld Emporium. Clarecraft figurines are made from a variety of different materials, including pewter and ceramic, and vary widely in size. They range from statues of characters to replicas of objects from the novels to locations appearing in the novels, and some function as book ends, stamps, or containers as well as figurines. The designers at Clarecraft consulted with Terry Pratchett to ensure their figurines accurately reflect the novels. Clarecraft figurines were available in stores throughout England as well as online through Collectors Gifts. Its figurines have become quite collectable, with discontinued items often selling for many times their original price on auction sites. Since their pieces were handmade in Britain rather than mass-produced like many figurines, each statue is different. The most expensive sale on record is that of an extremely rare piece sold on eBay in early 2005 to benefit the tsunami relief effort, which sold for ¬£1600. Clarecraft also ran a large fan club called The Discworld Collectors' Guild, which hosted a large convention every other year which drew about 1000 people, including Terry Pratchett himself.

The Strikers achieved what many people didn't think they could with a squad of mainly local-based players sprinkled with NSL experience, they made the NSL finals only to lose to Adelaide United on the away goals rule not only to bring down the curtain on their season but also that of the National Soccer League as we knew it. Fitzsimmons was signed by the foundation A-League club New Zealand Knights for the inaugural year of the A-League in what was a largely unsuccessful year for the club. On 25 January 2006 he agreed to part ways with the New Zealand Knights allowing him to look for a new club before the close of the January transfer window. Fitzsimmons linked up with his former Queensland state coach Miron Bleiberg touring Korea in pre-season with the Queensland Roar. Steve scored the only goal in the opening game of the Tongyeong Cup against Incheon United. He was subsequently signed to a short-term contract with Queensland Roar making a solitary appearance before being released at the conclusion of the season after Bleiberg was replaced by Frank Farina.Roar not yet the 'real' deal This looked to spell the end to Fitzsimmons's national league career as he went on to play for Brisbane Premier League side Palm Beach SC. The following year he moved to Beenleigh Football Club in the Brisbane Premier League Division 1 where he enjoyed a successful season playing 24 games for the club scoring 7 times including an important goal the club's Grand Final win against Capalaba Football Club. He was also on top in the Player of the Year award voting for Brisbane Premier League Division as voted by referees but was ruled ineligible due to a sending off against Albany Creek Excellsior Soccer Club in Round 21. Late in 2008, Fitzsimmons was rewarded for his performances while at Beenleigh Football Club by being one of the first signings for Gold Coast United.Miron starts signing players for A-League On 21 August 2009, he scored his first ever A-League goal in a 2‚Äì0 win for Gold Coast during the second half of United's game against Adelaide at Hindmarsh Stadium.Perfect start maintained in Adelaide Fitzsimmons turned down a move to Chinese Super League Club Qingdao Jonoon at the end of the 2009/10 season & he was rewarded for his performances with a new 1-year contract at Gold Coast United for the 2010/11 season taking him up to his 34th birthday. After retiring at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 A-League season, Fitzsimmons joined the staff at the club becoming Assistant Coach.

A dog's rhinarium with philtrum and conspicuous crenellations The rhinarium (New Latin, \\"belonging to the nose\\"; plural: rhinaria) is the furless skin surface surrounding the external openings of the nostrils in many mammals. Commonly it is referred to as the tip of the snout, and breeders of cats and dogs sometimes use the term nose leather. Informally, it may be called a \\"truffle\\", \\"wet snout\\" or \\"wet nose,\\" because its surface is moist in some species: for example, healthy dogs and cats. In many species, the rhinarium has a mid-line groove (cleft)the philtrumand a wrinkled (crenellated) surface.Lund University Faculty of Science Department of Biology Mammalian Rhinarium Group The rhinarium is a separate sense organ: it is a touch-based chemosensory organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). The rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object containing pheromones (usually large, non-volatile molecules), and transfer these pheromone molecules down the philtrum to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate. It also acts as a wind-direction detector: cold receptors in the skin of the rhinarium detect the orientation where evaporative cooling is highest, as determined by the wind direction. The study of the rhinarium's structure and associated functions has proven of considerable importance in the fields of mammalian evolution and taxonomy.Basbaum, Allan I. Kaneko, Akimichi, Shepherd, Gordon G. Westheimer, Gerald (editors). The Senses: A Comprehensive Reference. Academic press 2007. For example, primates are phylogenetically divided into those, such as lemurs, with the primitive rhinarium and the dry-nosed monkeys (Haplorhini, including apes and humans). In an analogous wayentirely unrelated to vertebrate morphologythe term rhinarium is sometimes applied to chemosensory structures in invertebrates. For example, microscopic sensilla in the form of flattened sense organs on the antennae of aphids are referred to as rhinaria.Du Yongjun Yan Fushun Tang Jue. \\"Structure and Function of Olfactory Sensilla on the Antennae of Soybean Aphids, Aphis glycines\\". ACTA Entomologica Sinica 1995, Vol. 38 Issue (1): 1‚Äì7 Morphology =Derivation= Morphologically, the rhinarium belongs to the olfactory system, but which part of the system it derives from is open to debate. One possibility is the main olfactory system, which captures media- borne odors; another is the \\"second nose,\\" the accessory olfactory system, which samples chemicals dissolved in fluids. Arguments supporting the former position consider the rhinarium \\"an outward extension of the olfactory ... skin that covers the nasal passages, [which] contains nerve receptors for smell and touch.\\" If that interpretation is correct, and the rhinarium is an extension of the olfactory epithelium lining the nasal passages, then it derives from the main system. But one opposing view traces a path from the philtrum over a notch in the upper lip, through a gap between the first incisors and premaxillae, along a \\"midline palatal groove\\" to \\"a canal that connects with the duct of the vomeronasal organ,\\" suggesting that the rhinarium belongs to the accessory system. It is unclear if moisture (mucus) there functions to trap odiferous molecules ‚Äî or is the remnant of a fluid transmission system for pheromonal molecules. =Crenellations= Typically, the rhinarium is crenellated (wrinkled, crackled, or embossed), which may, in theory, increase its sensory area, but there are many exceptions and variations among different mammalian taxa, and also variations in the innervation and sensilla of the rhinarium, so such generalized speculation should be treated with caution regarding this matter. Function Mammals with rhinaria tend to have a more acute sense of smell, and the loss of the rhinarium in the haplorrhine primates is related to their decreased reliance on olfaction, being associated with other derived characteristics such as a reduced number of turbinates. The rhinarium is also very useful to animals with good sense of smell because of its role as a wind-direction detector. The cold receptors in the skin respond to the place where evaporation is the highest. Thus the detection of a particular smell is associated with the direction it comes from. The rhinarium is adapted for different purposes in different mammals, according to ecological niche. In aquatic mammals, the development of lobes beside the nostrils allows them to close for diving. In mammals that dig or root with their noses, the rhinarium often develops into a resilient pad, with the nostrils off to the side (or below) and capable of closing to keep out dust. Examples include the common wombat, marsupial mole, and members of the Chrysochloridae. In elephants, the rhinarium has become a tactile organ. And in the walrus, a covering of stiff bristles protects it while the animal forages for shellfish. In many animals, the form and purpose of the rhinarium remains unclear. Evolutionary pressures also are not always unequivocally distinguishable, and there have been upheavals in late 20th and early 21st century taxonomy. For example, the lack of an obvious rhinarium in Tarsiiformes has been interpreted by some scholars as the consequence of the enormous development of the eyeballs, rather than a loss of relevance of olfaction.,Smith, T. D., & Bhatnagar, K. P. (2004). Microsmatic primates: reconsidering how and when size matters. The Anatomical Record Part B: The New Anatomist, 279(1), 24-31. but the significance is currently debatable, because there currently is an influential body of opinion favouring inclusion of the tarsiers in the Haplorhini rather than in the Strepsirrhini as had been traditional. Phylogeny =Mammalian = The rhinarium is a general mammalian feature and therefore likely to have been present in the stem mammals. =Primate = Primates are phylogenetically divided into those with a rhinarium, the Strepsirrhini (the prosimians: the lorises, and the lemurs); and those without a rhinarium, the Haplorhini, (the Simians: monkeys, apes, and humans). In place of the rhinarium, Haplorhini have a more mobile, continuous, dry upper lip. Use of term in invertebrates In an analogous usage unrelated to vertebrate morphology, the term rhinarium is sometimes applied to chemosensory structures in invertebrates. For example, microscopic sensilla in the flattened sense organs on the antennae of aphids are referred to as rhinaria.Du Yongjun Yan Fushun Tang Jue.

It is a well-cemented medium to coarse grained limestone characterised by marked bedding planes of clay inclusions and less well-cemented material which weather differentially to give exposed blocks a characteristic furrowed appearance. In origin, Hamstone is a Jurassic limestone from the Toarcian, or Upper Lias, stage. History In the 19th century there were 24 small quarries operating on Ham Hill employing some 200 men.Ham Hill Country Park -Medieval and Victorian History ‚Äî Visit South Somerset In later Victorian times industrial quarrying expanded significantly, with upwards of 200 small family-run quarries and masonry businesses operating on site.Ham Hill Country Park ‚Äî Victorians to More Recent Times ‚Äî Visit South Somerset Modern quarrying Today hamstone is quarried in only two areas of Ham Hill. The North quarry, run by Ham & Doulting Stone, extracts stone from just beneath the surface and is the longest running hamstone quarry in existence.Ham Stone - Ham & Doulting Stone Ltd The Norton or South quarry, run by Harvey Stone, extracts its stone from some 20‚Äì30 metres below the surface. This quarry was formed by the re-opening of workings that were abandoned in the 1930s. Hamstone House was built with the last significant supply of hamstone from the quarries before their closure. Both quarries are owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. A study by South Somerset District Council‚Äôs Area Conservation Officer noted that the stone of the South quarry is yellower in colour, less hard and less durable than the greyer North quarry hamstone. North quarry stone is primarily used by local stonemasons for the repair of external features in historic buildings, such as mullion windows and ashlars stonework as well as for new developments in conservation areas. Style and usage Described by Simon Jenkins as \\"the loveliest building material in England\\", hamstone is soft enough to be cut to make decorative features such as doorway arches and bell openings in church towers such as at the Church of St Mary at Chedzoy, Somerset. The attractive colour also contributes to its being chosen by masons and architects for more than 1000 years for adorning the buildings in the countryside of surrounding Somerset. Hamstone is featured in the medieval church towers throughout the county, and the town of South Petherton is built largely of the material. Besides being used for building, hamstone was also burnt locally in small kilns for the manufacture of lime, predominantly for use as fertiliser. Some was used for the manufacture of builders' mortar and limewash render, but the results were of poor quality due to the iron content of the stone. At least two lime kilns still exist: one close to the abandoned medieval hamlet of Witcombe, with another close to Norton Quarry.

His reputation was established with his first book, The Innocent Anthropologist (1983), an account of anthropological field work in Cameroon. After working in Africa he moved to Indonesia, where he wrote the humorous Not a Hazardous Sport (1989) about his anthropological experiences in Tana Toraja. He has since written numerous other works. Biography Barley spent some years living in Tana Toraja, Sulawesi studying the local customs. Barley was born in Kingston upon Thames in 1947. He gained his bachelor's degree in modern languages at Cambridge University, and his doctorate in social anthropology at Oxford University. He worked for some years as an academic at London University and then served from 1980 to 2003 as an assistant keeper of Ethnography at the British Museum. Barley's first travel book, The Innocent Anthropologist (1983), gave a popular account of anthropological field work among the Dowayo people of Cameroon. Barley then worked as an anthropologist in Indonesia. His first book based on his time there was the humorous Not a Hazardous Sport (1989) describing his anthropological experiences in Tana Toraja in the mountains of central Sulawesi. Barley has written on many other subjects including Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, and Sir James Brooke, the \\"white rajah\\" of Sarawak. He has been twice nominated for the Travelex Writer of the Year Award. In 2002, he won the Foreign Press Association prize for travel writing. Reception =The Innocent Anthropologist= Wooden fertility doll with beaded cords and amulets from the Dowayo people of West Africa studied by Barley. TropenMuseum collection. The journalist and author Ryszard Kapuscinski wrote that whereas the \\"modern literature\\" represented in French literary awards largely failed to talk about people from other cultures, Barley's Innocent Anthropologist, like Colin Thubron's Behind the Wall and Bruce Chatwin's Songlines did \\"show us the modern cultures, ideas and behaviour of people who live in different geographical latitudes and who believe in different gods from us\\", even if these books were not considered to be \\"real literature\\" by some within the literary elite. quoted in The anthropologist Tony Waters calls Innocent Anthropologist a memorably written story, and writes that it is the book he gets students to read for an understanding of \\"field work, ethnography, and cultural anthropology.\\" Waters says he truly admires the book as it gives a realistic idea of field experience, but \\"Oddly, I find few anthropologists who have read it, much less heard of it.\\" =Not a Hazardous Sport= Tim Hannigan, reflecting on Not a Hazardous Sport in the Asian Review of Books, wrote that British travel writing has had a \\"preeminent court jester\\" in each generation, from Robert Byron in the 1930s, Eric Newby in the 1950s, and Redmond O'Hanlon in the 1980s. But in his view, Barley's writing has survived the test of time \\"in a postcolonial world\\" far better than O'Hanlon's, not least because, as an anthropologist, his observations on the people he wrote about were underpinned by \\"professional fieldwork ... proper language training and research\\". Hannigan found Barley's prose \\"effortlessly jaunty .. with an air of permanent good-natured amusement. But there's also the faintly discernible trace of inexplicable melancholy common to the best of British comic travel writing\\". All in all, Hannigan considered it an excellent travel book, both a \\"vicarious journey\\", entertaining, and valuable for steering the reader \\"away from complacency\\".
