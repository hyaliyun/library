It was created by brothers Michael Strasser and Stefan Strasser in late 2001. Since 2004 a weekly strip is being published regularly on their website. The comic is especially popular among people who have some relation with or affinity to this particular industry, from pilots over airline personnel to modelers or flight simmers. As the artists try to appeal to this niche market of aviation fans, a few of the jokes are hard to understand or simply not funny for outsiders. The creators Michael Strasser is a helicopter pilot and flight instructor who lives and works in California. His brother Stefan Strasser is a cartoonist and illustrator who lives behind a drawing table in Vienna. Together they combine the background knowledge and artistic skills needed for this project. Characters Many characters are based on one or more real life persons. E.g. \\"Captain Ed\\" is based on the airline captain/author Ed Owen (Your Captain Speaking) and the name \\"Chuck\\" was inspired by Chuck Aaron, currently the only helicopter aerobatics pilot in the USA. =Main= Chuck 80px Chuck is the pilot of \\"Roost Air\\" and features all the stereotypical characteristics that are associated with pilots: He always wears big and expensive sunglasses and a big and expensive watch. He is known and feared by air traffic controllers because of his one- of-a-kind sense of direction and knowledge of radio procedures. Chuck likes to think of himself as a womanizer, or rather a \\"chickenizer\\", but usually ends up alone due to his mouth and his inability to think before he speaks (or, as other cases prove, inability to think at all). His reputation has spread far and wide, and when he gets into a particularly absurd situation or exchange on the radio, there will often be the question \\"Chuck, is that you?\\" Julio 80px Julio is the typical aircraft mechanic who can fix everything from a helicopter turbine engine to Sally's coffee machine. He doesn't talk too much and doesn't really like pilots a lot. They tend to break \\"his\\" planes and never treat them the way he would like. His nickname is \\"Sparks\\", which seems to have originated from an unlucky hand with electricity, so he's not very proud of it. Sally 80px Sally is the flight dispatcher and secretary of \\"Roost Air\\". She's a very nice and good looking girl (at least for a chicken) and can make a killer coffee that can keep pilots awake for two nights in a row. Sally is always motivated and in high spirits, but unfortunately, aviation seems to be sort of a foreign language to her. Hans 80px Hans is the boss of \\"Roost Air\\" who has inherited the company from his uncle and used to run a yogurt factory before. But in his opinion \\"there can't be that much difference between yogurt and airplanes\\", so his resourceful management strategies turn out to be the main cause of things going wrong and turning complicated in the company. He has a slight German accent which he can't always hide. =Supporting= Jason 80px Jason is Chuck's flight student. He is very interested in everything related to aviation and has serious difficulties to hold his curiosity in check. While Sally and Hans love him, because he owns a chocolate factory, and Chuck can usually endure Jasons inquisitive manner, he often drives Julio crazy with his drumfire of questions. Captain Ed 80px Captain Ed is Chuck's uncle and also a pilot. But that's where the similarities end. He works as a captain for a major airline but is often burdened with straightening out the mess at Roost Air, trying to keep his nephew on the right track. Unlike Chuck he is known for his experience and his calm and positive manner. Ray 80px Ray is the mechanic from the FBO next door. He is a duck from the south and pretty much Julios only shoulder to lean and cry on when it comes to mechanical questions. Nobu 80px Nobu is the pilot from the FBO next door. He is Japanese but has been living in the United States long enough to really master the language and to get used to a Roost-Air style of corporate culture. His full name is Nobutada Yakitori, but since nobody can pronounce it right, they call him Nobu. Chicken Wings in print So far the Strasser brothers published three books with their collected material. The first book was first published by Infinity Publishing. Later on the brothers decided to re-print and publish it by themselves, successfully selling it through pilot shops around the world and through their own webshop. Chicken Wings ‚Äì The First Book () and Chicken Wings 2 ‚Äì Full Throttle (). Chicken Wings strips and cartoons are published regularly in the following magazines: Trade-A-Plane (USA), EAA Sport Aviation Magazine (USA), Americas Flyways (USA), Atlantic Flyer (USA), Pilot Magazine (UK), Siivet (Finland), Flynytt (Norway), Take-Off (Portugal), Aeromarkt (Germany), Fliegermagazin (Germany) and JP4 (Italy). An italian edition of the first three books is also available.

Voter turnout was 75.1%.Dieter Nohlen, Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I, p123 Results Aftermath The second Knesset was highly unstable, with four separate governments, two different Prime Ministers and several defections; Rostam Bastuni, Avraham Berman and Moshe Sneh left Mapam and set up the Left Faction. Bastuni later returned to Mapam whilst Berman and Sneh joined Maki. Hannah Lamdan and David Livschitz also left Mapam, establising the Faction independent of Ahdut HaAvoda before joining Mapai. Four other members left Mapam to found Ahdut HaAvoda ‚Äì Poale Zion, but the move was not recognised by the Knesset speaker. During the Knesset term, Sephardim and Oriental Communities joined the General Zionists. As with the first Knesset, the speaker was Yosef Sprinzak. =Third government= The second Knesset started with David Ben-Gurion forming the third government of Israel (the first Knesset had two governments) on 8 October 1951. His Mapai party formed a coalition with Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, Agudat Yisrael, Agudat Yisrael Workers and the three Israeli Arab parties, the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Progress and Work and Agriculture and Development. Like the first Knesset, there were 15 ministers. The government resigned on 19 December 1952 due to a dispute with the religious parties over religious education. =Fourth government= Ben-Gurion formed the fourth government on 24 December 1952, dropping the ultra-orthodox parties (Agudat Yisrael and Agudat Yisrael Workers) and replacing them with the General Zionists and the Progressive Party. The new government had 16 ministers. Ben-Gurion resigned on 6 December 1953 as he wished to settle in the Negev kibbutz of Sde Boker. =Fifth government= Moshe Sharett formed the fifth government on 26 January 1954 with the same coalition partners and ministers. Sharett resigned on 29 June 1955, when the General Zionists refused to abstain from voting on a motion of no-confidence brought by Herut and Maki over the government's position on the trial of Malchiel Gruenwald, who had accused Rudolf Kastner of collaborating with the Nazis. =Sixth government= Sharett formed the sixth government on 29 June 1955, eliminating the General Zionists and the Progressive Party from the coalition and reducing the number of ministers to 12. The new government did not last long, as a general election was called for 26 July 1955.

It is a settlement scheme started in 1960s by the first president of the Republic of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta near a fresh water lake bearing his name. Location Mpeketoni lies in Lamu County, , south of the Garsen‚ÄìWitu‚ÄìLamu Highway, approximately southwest of Mokowe, on the coast. The coordinates of the town are: 2¬∞23'28.0\\"S, 40¬∞41'50.0\\"E (Latitude:-2.391119; Longitude:40.697233). History Originally, Mpeketoni and its surroundings were inhabited by Swahilis called Wabajuni and a small hunting and gathering tribe by the name of Wasanye or the Sanyes who are almost extinct. In the early 1970s Mpeketoni was transformed into a settlement area for landless Kenyans. Most of those who settled there were Kenyans from up country, largely members of the Kikuyu community who had been living in Tanzania but decided to return home because of the changing political climate. The Kikuyu tribe, which is traditionally a farming community, mostly populates this area. Other tribes found in Mpeketoni include the Luos and Kambas as well as the original local Swahili people. The town is on a route that was used by the Arab traders taking their commodities \\"slaves\\" to Lamu Island. Up to now huge mango trees along the way from Mpeketoni to Lamu Island are still visible and are said to have grown from the seeds of the mangoes slaves were eating. Overview The land has since been painstakingly transformed to arable land for farming. The main cash crops include maize, cotton, cassava, cashew nuts, mangoes, and bananas. The people of Mpeketoni have benefited from the efforts from a variety of non-profit organizations, a German not-for-profit organization GTZ and a Dutch philanthropist with ongoing charity projects since 1987. Schools, a clinic and a church have been built with funds collected from the Netherlands in collaboration with the Groen van Prinsterer school in Vlaardingen, in the Netherlands. The clinic was named Maria Teresa Nuzzo Health Centre after the foundress of the Catholic Sisters', a congregation that run it. It is now the Mpeketoni Hospital. Mpeketoni is host to Lake Kenyatta, a fresh-water lake that covers about . The lake is an ecological site with variety of fish, not less than 3,500 hippos and a large array of birds. Population As of June 2015, the population of the town was estimated at about 50,000. Administration The Division is divided into small administrative villages, including Kiongwe, Baharini, Mkunumbi, Bomani, Uziwa, Mapenya, Lakeside, Kibaoni, Hongwe and Tewa.

She is best known for her philosophical treatises on feminism and women's role in society. She is an advocate of liberal feminism and women migrant workers' rights in France. A 2010 Marianne news magazine poll named her France's \\"most influential intellectual\\", primarily on the basis of her books on women's rights and motherhood. Badinter is the largest shareholder of Publicis Groupe, a multinational advertising and public relations company, and the chairwoman of its supervisory board.Lutter contre le voile et‚Ä¶ √™tre charg√©e de la com‚Äô de l‚ÄôArabie Saoudite: le troublant m√©lange des genres d‚ÄôElisabeth Badinter, Metronews, 5 April 2016. She received these shares in an inheritance from her father, Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, who founded the company. https://www.forbes.com/profile/elisabeth-badinter/#4f911b0250b7 According to Forbes, she is one of the wealthiest French citizens with a fortune of around US$1.8 billion in 2012. The World's Billionaires List, Forbes, March 2012. Early life Badinter is the daughter of Sophie Vaillant and Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, founder of Publicis. Sophie Vaillant was the granddaughter of √âdouard Vaillant, a French political leader and social activist. Sophie's mother was raised as a Roman Catholic in a middle class upbringing, and later converted to Judaism following her marriage. Elisabeth and her two sisters were raised by parents who believed in the equality of the sexes. She received her secondary education from L'√©cole alsacienne, a private school in Paris. During adolescence, Badinter read Simone de Beauvoir's the Second Sex, which profoundly influenced her views, inspiring her pursuit of a doctorate in philosophy at Sorbonne University. She is a specialist in French history of the Age of Enlightenment. Career After her studies, Badinter taught at the √âcole Polytechnique. Her first book titled, L'Amour en plus, was published in 1980 and raises the question of whether maternal love is an exclusively natural instinct or a tendency reinforced in the cultural context, in which the behaviour of motherly affection is expected. In her critical work, L'un est l'autre, published in 1987, Badinter reflects upon the complementarities of masculine and feminine traits in gendered identities and the conflicts that arise when these complementarities are subjected to oppression. Badinter concludes that a new era of gendered resemblances will lead to a change in gender identities and a revolution of moral values. Her 2003 treatise, La fausse route, addresses misandry and victimisation of women by French contemporary feminists. \\"The systematic denial of women's power and violence, the constant portrayal of women as oppressed and therefore innocent is deepening the crevasses of a divided humanity: the victims of masculine oppression on one side and the almighty executioners on the other. \\" Political activism During the 1989 Islamic scarf controversy in France, Badinter, R√©gis Debray, Alain Finkielkraut, Elisabeth de Fontenay and Catherine Kintzler wrote an open letter to the then Minister of Education, Lionel Jospin, demanding to not let students who refuse to take off their headscarves go to school. Badinter believes that the French public education system should be free of any religious affiliation and that neutrality in public institutions of a secularist state must prevail over expressions of individuality in them. Personal life In 1966, she married lawyer Robert Badinter, who became Minister of Justice under Mitterrand.Elisabeth Badinter profile, jwa.org.

In a variation on the medieval beacon system the Navy built four semaphore stations at key high points on the Island. These relayed to the admiral at Portsmouth details of all shipping seen off the island, and the final messages all passed through Ashey. There is a story that in 1969, a Dr. White of St Helens and his wife saw some mysterious lights when driving by Ashey Down at night.

The third named storm of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Cindy developed within a trough as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on 16 September. The disturbance quickly intensified, with a distinct eye becoming visible on satellite imagery as it drifted north-northwestwards toward the Texas coastline. After peaking with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), it made landfall at High Island on the morning of 17 September at peak strength with an atmospheric pressure of 997 mbar (hPa; 29.44 inHg). Cindy remained nearly stationary for almost a day, dropping copious rainfall over the Texas coastal plain, before finally turning west-southwestward and dissipating west of Corpus Christi on 20 September. Hurricane watches and warnings were issued prior to Cindy's landfall, hastening evacuations in coastal areas of Louisiana and Texas, with many refugees seeking safety in local shelters. Although tide and wind damage was minimal, extreme rainfall totaling upwards of resulted in severe flooding in many areas of the Texas coastal plain; 4,000 homes were inundated in Jefferson, Orange, and Newton counties, many of them after a levee ruptured in Port Acres. Dozens of residents were forced to flee in rising flood waters, and many streets and roadways became impassable as a result of Cindy's flooding. Strong winds shattered glass windows, and schools throughout southeastern Texas were closed due to the hurricane. Widespread crop damage was observed, with rice, cotton, and pecan harvests suffering the worst. Overall, damage amounted to $12.5 million (1963 USD), and three deaths were recorded.  Meteorological history  The origins of Cindy can be traced to a low-pressure area which formed within a trough positioned approximately east-northeast of Brownsville, Texas on 16 September, though inclement weather had been reported in the Gulf of Mexico the previous two days. The disturbance soon strengthened into a tropical storm, developing a well-defined circulation near 1800 UTC. By the afternoon, it had become well-organized enough to prompt the New Orleans Weather Bureau office to initiate advisories on the storm, christening it Cindy. A distinct eye was noted on radar around 2000 UTC, and around then a maritime report issued by the SS Sabine documented winds of hurricane intensity, which was the forecasters' basis for operationally upgrading the storm to a hurricane. While operationally classified as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), a reanalysis of the storm in November 2019 as part of the ongoing Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project determined that Cindy never reached hurricane intensity, instead peaking as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Despite its favorable environment, Cindy remained disorganized, featuring an asymmetric -wide eye; little further strengthening occurred over the course of the night. Upon Cindy's landfall at High Island the following morning, its atmospheric pressure was measured at 996 mbar (hPa; 29.41 inHg), and winds reached 75 mph (120 km/h). Soon after moving ashore, Cindy became nearly stationary for 18 hours, maintaining tropical storm status before weakening to a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on 18 September. The remnants of Cindy gradually turned westward-to-southwestward and decreased in strength during 18 and 19 September. As a result of its abnormally slow movement and deterioration, extremely heavy rains were recorded over Texas and Louisiana, especially in the storm's northeastern quadrant. Cindy finally dissipated on 20 September while situated west of Corpus Christi.  Preparations and impact  In advance of Cindy's arrival, a hurricane watch was issued between Freeport, Texas and Grand Isle, Louisiana on 16 September. The New Orleans Weather Bureau office imposed a hurricane warning between Galveston, Texas and Vermilion Bay, Louisiana three hours later, and additionally replaced the earlier hurricane watch with a gale warning. After making landfall on the morning of 17 September, the hurricane warning for Cindy was discontinued, though flood warnings and small craft warnings remained in effect for coastal areas of southeastern Texas. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying areas along a arc, and five buses were sent to help in evacuation efforts in Sabine County, Texas. Meanwhile, the Texas civil defense and disaster relief agency and other related organizations prepared for the storm as governor of Texas John Connally declared a state of emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana, approximately 5,000 individuals left the area prior to the storm, while 6,000 fled in the state as a whole; in neighboring Texas, 3,600 individuals living along the state's shoreline heeded the Weather Bureau's warnings, evacuating to higher ground. Emergency shelters opened along the Gulf Coast, with 1,500 taking refuge in Port Arthur, Texas, 525 in Beaumont, 1,078 in Galveston, 300 in Port Bolivar, and 475 total in Texas City, Hitchcock, and Lamarque. A state of emergency was declared in the city of Lake Charles, Louisiana, where officials prepared to feed up to 10,000 refugees as the Salvation Army and other relief agencies' volunteers were deployed to the region. Black-and-white radar imagery of Cindy One shrimp boat was initially reported missing and the tug Myra White transmitted a distress signal as its engines failed near an oil rig off of Galveston. High winds shattered glass windows at Port Arthur, Texas City, and Galveston, while schools were shut down in Galveston, Lamarque, Texas City, Alvin, and most of Galveston and Jefferson counties. Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm. Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and tore off shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four requests for assistance at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, and the other three apparently traveled to Galveston. Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed for the duration of the storm. Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous requests for assistance by residents of flooded homes. Two children, initially unaccounted for, were later found safe under a bridge abutment. In Amelia, a suburb of Beaumont, officials helped residents in low-lying neighborhoods to higher ground, and in Beaumont proper, flooding inundated streets, rendering some impassible. The hurricane partially defoliated palm trees, leaving palm fronds on streets and roadways, and several structures were toppled or damaged along the coast. Overall damage, however, was minimal. An levee sheltering Port Acres ruptured, forcing residents to stack 11,000 sandbags and dump sand to protect the suburb. There, storm waters inundated homes up to roof level, and after carp were swept into local farm fields, many locals fished for them with clubs; nearby, industrial complexes in Jefferson and Orange counties endured severe damage as well. Boats were tossed into the streets of Beaumont, and numerous highways were unusable for travel due to high water; the widespread flooding forced police to rescue 30 residents in the Beaumont area. The storm inundated rice, cotton, and pecan crops, with rice harvests suffering the worst impacts. Two men left stranded on a burning fishing boat off of Morgan City, Louisiana were later rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard without issue. Tides and winds resulted in few problems, with flooding causing the majority of Cindy's damage; storm surge reached above normal levels, enough to destroy only a few piers and damage several boats. The hurricane's abnormally slow trajectory over the Texas coastal plain led to extremely high rainfall totals being measured in parts of Jefferson, Orange, and Newton counties in Texas, where storm waters inundated 4,000 homes, and Calcasieu and Vermilion parishes in Louisiana. The most extreme rainfall totals were measured in Deweyville, Texas, where of precipitation fell over a three-day period, with alone falling in 24 hours. Farther north, Cindy inundated 25 businesses and 35 homes in Guthrie, Oklahoma, where up to of water forced 300 residents to flee. Upwards of $11.7 million (1963 USD) in property damage was noted, and crop damage reached $500,000 in Texas and $360,000 in Louisiana; one man drowned after falling overboard on a boat taking oil rig personnel back to land, while two others drowned under high waters at Port Acres. Overall, Cindy inflicted $12.5 million in damage and three deaths.

With almost EUR 1.9 billion, the GVA in B√°cs-Kiskun had increased by 50% compared to 1995. Economic structure The primary sector accounted for 12.3% of the Gross Value Added of the county in 2001, and this was the highest share of any county. However, this share is declining over the years: it was 15.6% in 1995. The share of the secondary sector is relatively constant over the years, with 30.9% of the Gross Value Added in 2001 (compared to 29.5% in 1995). The tertiary sector's GVA has increased most, although it still had a low share (56.8%) compared to the country as a whole (64.4%). =Service and trade= Service and trade are the dominant sectors of B√°cs-Kiskun's economy, where privatisation occurred first. 80% of the industrial output is represented by the food, machine, wood, and printing industries. The more substantial companies in the region attracted more investment. In the course of privatisation the Kecskem√©t cannery was purchased by Heinz, the Kiskunhalas textile mill partially by Levi's. During the privatisation, the Danube Knitting Mill in Baja was acquired by an American financial investment group The operation of the Delhus abattoir and the sale of meat is an important part of the county economy Among the industrial companies operating in the area of Baja are UNILEVER Rt. producing deep frozen products, the Bread factory of B√°cska S√ºtoipari Rt., the abattoir of D√âLH√öS and the Pannonia Brewery. The local government of Baja are encouraging the expansion of foreign capital by reducing local taxes. There are approximately 39,600 firms in the county, representing 4.6% of the national total. The majority of companies employ only several people; indeed, 95% have 10 or fewer employees. Two per cent of companies belong in the medium category, employing between 21 and 50 people, while the number and proportion of those employing 300 or more is very small. =Agriculture= Fruit, vegetable, corn and wheat production are the most successful branches of the region's agriculture. Compared to the other Hungarian counties, B√°cs-Kiskun has the second largest number of pigs (10% of the Hungarian pig stock) and 7% of cattle stock. The stock of sheep made up 194,000 at the end of 2002, 17.6% of Hungary's total stock and the largest in Hungary. Research The 100-year history of agricultural research, and the more recent technical, medical, and social research have played an important role in the shaping of B√°cs-Kiskun's present profile. It was in the sandy soils around Kecskem√©t that the newly established Vegetable Research Institute conducted its first tests in the 1940s. Its work has since become internationally recognized. The same is true of the work of the Grape Research Institute - 7 000 grape hybrids and almost 100 grape species have been developed there and good results have been achieved in the improvement of species and in the development of virus- resistant varieties. The Kecskem√©t faculty of the Horticultural University researches into the biological, chemical, technical, and economic aspects of food production and preservation. The centre of technical research is the College of Automation and Engineering but important work is also being conducted by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Astronomy. Highly complex operations are undertaken in the county's hospitals, especially in the area of internal medicine. The Aviation Medical Research Institute is also based here where, amongst other things, astronauts are prepared and trained.

Its English translation (by Klara Glowczewska) was first published in 1994. The book is both a personal travelogue and a memoir, divided into three parts. Synopsis In the first part, entitled First Encounters (1939-1967), Kapu≈õci≈Ñski writes about the 1939 entry of the Red Army into Pi≈Ñsk, his home town in the Polesie area, and about the poverty and terror he experienced during the ensuing Soviet rule. He continues to describe his postwar experiences in the Soviet Union, including his travel on the Trans-Siberian Railway, and his travels to Central Asian and Transcaucasian republics of the Soviet Union, today Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. The second part of the book, From a Bird's-eye View (1989-1991), makes up over one half of the book, and is a travelogue from his lone trips around the Soviet Union during its collapse. In the European part of the USSR Kapu≈õci≈Ñski visited, among others, Brest, Moscow and Donetsk, in the Far North - Magadan and Vorkuta, in the South - Tbilisi and Yerevan. During these voyages he traveled over 60,000 km, mostly by plane. The last, shortest part, The Sequel Continues (1992-1993), is a summary. It is also an attempt to analyze the changes in the countries that arose from the disintegration of the USSR. According to the author himself, the whole work does not end with a higher and final synthesis, but with the reverse, because during its writing the subject and theme of the book, the great Soviet Empire, has disappeared.

In 336 BC, Alexander the Great's empire was spreading, and many in Athens were opposed to the ongoing wars. Among the most outspoken was the orator Demosthenes. In 336 BC, Ctesiphon proposed that Athens honor Demosthenes for services to the city by presenting him with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue, and in 330 BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and attacked vehemently those who backed Alexander the Great's empire. As to legal irregularities, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon for having violated the law in three points: * For making false allegations in a state document. * For unlawfully conferring a crown to a state official (Demosthenes) who had not yet rendered a report of his term of office. * For unlawfully offering the crown at the festival called Dionysia.

Hogarth Roundabout looking east and south It was quickly put together with a cheap steel frame and was designed to last no more than a few years. The central span has pairs of diagonal cross-braces to give the structure strength and help protect it against strong winds. The junction would have been incorporated into the plans for the London Ringways project and a far more substantial permanent structure put in place, however, the London Ringways plans were finally scrapped in the latter years of the 20th century. Recently, a major refurbishment to install a new deck, surface and parapets has ensured its survival and confirmed its stature as a permanent fixture.

Two examples of such situations are: * In derivatives transactions governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) standard documentation, it is common for the ISDA Master Agreement to be governed by the laws of New York state, and for the Credit Support Annexe to be governed by English law.

The retropubic space is a preperitoneal space, located behind the transversalis fascia and in front of peritoneum . Other names for the retropubic space are \\"Cave of Retzius\\" or \\"Retzius' space\\", named after the Swedish anatomist Anders Retzius (1796-1860). The space is a useful landmark in different gynecological and urological surgeries. Structure The space is located in the pelvic region and is bounded by the following structures: *Anteriorly: Symphysis pubis *Laterally: Pubic rami and obturator internus muscles *Posteriorly: Urinary bladder *Floor: Anterior vagina (in women) and proximal urethra Function The retropubic space is a potential space. = Compartmental Pressure = The retropubic space is directly adjacent to the abdominal cavity and is hence affected with change in intra-abdominal pressure, which in turn affects the physiology of urination and continence. Normally, intra-abdominal pressure is between 5 and 7 mmHg, and can reach 10 to 15 mmHg chronically in certain cases, such as in pregnant or obese patients. The pressure is strongly related to body mass index and a history of previous surgical procedures. This highly elevated pressure in obese and pregnant patients is sometimes referred to as chronic intra-abdominal hypertension. This pressure is relayed to the adjacent retropubic compartment and can affect the structures within. Clinical significance  The retropubic space is a surgical landmark that has surgical significance in several gynecological and urological procedures. Access to the space is achieved by separating the rectus abdominis muscle at the mid line, and bluntly dissecting the tissue in the direction of the symphysis pubis, until reaching the peritoneum.

The film is notable for having almost no spoken dialogue. Plot The film depicts a small family, a husband and wife and two sons, struggling to get by on a tiny island in the Seto Inland Sea on the island of Sukune in Mihara, Hiroshima, over the course of a year. They are the island's only occupants, and survive by farming. They must repeatedly carry the water for their plants and themselves in a row boat from a neighboring island. When the boys catch a large fish, the family travels to Onomichi by ferry, where they sell it to a fishmonger, then eat at a modern restaurant. While the parents are away from the island, the older son falls ill. The desperate father runs to find a doctor to come to treat his son, but when they arrive, the boy is already dead. After the boy's funeral, which is attended by his classmates from his school on the neighboring island, the family resumes their hard life, with very limited opportunity for grief. Production Director and scriptwriter Kaneto Shindo decided to make this film because he wanted to make a film without any dialogue. The independent production company Kindai Eiga Kyokai was close to bankruptcy at the time this film was made, and Shindo sank his last funds into making the film. The film's financial success saved the company. The lead actor Taiji Tonoyama was suffering from severe liver disease due to alcohol dependence, but recovered his health because there was no alcohol available near the filming location. These events were later dramatized in Shindo's biopic about Tonoyama, By Player. In his last published book before he died, Shindo noted that the film's premise of carrying water to the island is false, because the crop shown being watered in the film, sweet potatoes, do not actually need extensive watering. Shindo deliberately made the actors carry heavily-loaded buckets of water so that the yokes they were using would be seen to bend, symbolizing the harshness of their lives. Sukune Island The island location in the film is an uninhabited island called Sukune off the coast of a larger island called Sagishima, part of Mihara, Hiroshima. Reception In 1961, the film won the Grand Prix (in a tie with Grigori Chukhrai's Chistoye nebo) at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival, at which Luchino Visconti (whose La Terra Trema is an inspiration) was a jury member. In 1963, the film was nominated for \\"Best Film from any Source\\" at the 16th British Academy Film Awards.

He entered the University of the South (Sewanee, Tennessee) in 1888, where he studied under William Porcher Du Bose. He obtained a B.D. degree in 1894. =Career= Manning became a deacon on December 12, 1889, and was ordained as a priest on December 12, 1891.

Manning served as a volunteer chaplain at Camp Upton. Bishop Manning supported the Oxford Groups of the 1930s (not to be confused with the Oxford Movement of the 1830s, of which he was also a supporter) and in 1925 helped Rev. Sam Shoemaker become rector of Calvary Church, where Shoemaker revived the dwindling missionary congregation and later helped found Alcoholics Anonymous.Shoemaker, I Stand by the Door: the life of Sam Shoemaker (Harper and Row, 1967) pp. 48-50 From 1922 to 1924, Bishop Manning was in the public eye because of controversies with the Rev. Percy Stickney Grant, who expressed a radical point of view. Manning also came into conflict with the Rev. William Norman Guthrie, because of dancing and other innovations at his religious services in St. Mark's in-the-Bouwerie, New York City. After the war, as Bishop of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Manning led a $10,000,000 capital campaign to revive construction and complete more sections of the church. Under his direction, the cathedral employed and trained neighborhood men as skilled stonemasons and carvers during the decades of the continuing project. Bishop Manning dedicated The Church of the Epiphany on New York City's Upper East Side on October 29, 1939. In 1939‚Äì40, Bishop Manning took a leadership role in the successful effort to force the City University of New York to rescind their offer of a professorship to the philosopher Bertrand Russell.

It was originally connected to the Sumatran mainland and became separated by sea after the volcano's last eruption in the Pleistocene era. The island is situated in the Andaman Sea. The largest city on the island, Sabang, is the northernmost outpost of Indonesia. The island is known for its ecosystem; the Indonesian government has declared of inland and sea around the island as a wildlife protection area. A rare megamouth shark species was found on shore and the island is the only habitat for the threatened toad, Duttaphrynus valhallae (formerly Bufo valhallae). Coral reef areas around the island are known for their large variety of fish species.  Geography  Weh Island is located in the Andaman Sea, where two groups of islands, the Nicobar Islands and Andaman Islands, are scattered in one line from Sumatra to the north up to the Burma plate. The Andaman Sea lies on an active moving small tectonic plate (microplate). A complex geological fault system and volcanic arc islands have been created along the length of the sea by the movement of the microplate. The island lies about off the northernmost tip of Sumatra. The island is small at only , but mountainous. The highest peak is a fumarolic volcano, high. The last known eruption is estimated to have occurred in the Pleistocene age, as a result which the mountain partially collapsed and was filled by the sea, forming a separate island. At a depth of , close to Sabang city, underwater fumaroles emerge from the seabed. At Gapang Beach (Gapang is name of a kind of a tree), one hour from Balohan Port to the west, there are also underwater fumaroles which are suitable for diving and are called Hydrothermal Point. A volcanic cone is found in the jungle. There are three solfatara (mudpot) fields on the island: one is southeast of the summit and the others are and northwest of the summit, on the western shore of Lhok Perialakot bay. There are four islets surrounding Weh Island: Klah, Rubiah, Seulako, and Rondo. Among those, Rubiah is well known for diving tourism, because of its coral reefs. When traveling to Saudi Arabia was only possible by sea, Rubiah was used as a place of quarantine for Indonesian Muslims during the Hajj pilgrimage season.  Inhabitants  Weh Island is a part of Aceh province. A 1993 census reported 24,700 inhabitants. The large majority of the population are Acehnese and the remaining are Minangkabau, Javanese, Batak and Chinese. It is unknown when the island was first inhabited. Islam is the main religion, as Aceh is a special province where Sharia law has been applied exclusively for the province. However, there are some Christians and Buddhists on the island. They are mostly Javanese, Batak and Chinese. On 26 December 2004, a 9.1‚Äì9.3 undersea earthquake struck in the Andaman Sea. The earthquake triggered a series of tsunamis that killed at least 130,000 people in Indonesia alone. The effect on the island was relatively small, but it is unknown how many of its inhabitants were killed by the event.  Economy  Painting of Sabang port in 1910 The economy on Weh Island is dominated by agriculture. The main products are cloves and coconuts. Small-scale fisheries operate in the area, and fishermen have used explosives and cyanide fishing extensively. Therefore, since 1982, a wildlife protection area (suaka alam) has been declared by the Indonesian government that includes inland and of surrounding sea. The two main cities are Sabang and Balohan. Balohan is a ferry port that serves as a hub between the island and Banda Aceh on the mainland Sumatra. Sabang has been an important quay since the late nineteenth century, because the city overlooks the entry to a busy shipping route, Malacca Strait. SS Sumatra docked at Sabang in c. 1895 Before the Suez Canal was opened in 1869, the Indonesian archipelago was reached via the Sunda Strait from Africa. From the Suez Canal, the route to Indonesia is shorter via the Malacca Strait. Due to its natural harbour with relatively deep and well sheltered water, the Dutch East Indies government decided to open Sabang as a quay. In 1883, Sabang quay was opened for ships to dock by the Atjeh Associate. At first, the harbour was intended as a coal station for the Dutch navy, but later also served merchant vessels and for the transfer of export goods from northern Sumatra. Each year, 50,000 vessels pass through Malacca Strait. In 2000, the Indonesian government declared Sabang a Free Trade Zone and Free Port, to gain economic benefit by establishing the port as a logistic hub for international vessels passing through the strait. Infrastructures for a deep water harbour, port, warehousing and refuelling facilities, were developed. Weh Island is served by the Maimun Saleh Airport located in Sabang. Currently there is no airlines serving that airport. Thus, the nearest airport to get into Sabang is the Sultan Iskandarmuda Airport which is located at Banda Aceh. From the airport of Banda Aceh, it's about a half-hour drive to Ulee Lheu, close to the center of Banda Aceh, from where the ferries to Balohan (Pulau Weh's ferry harbour) are leaving. Weh Island is also known for ecotourism. Underwater diving, hiking through the volcanic mountain and beach resorts are the main attractions. A small village, Iboih, is known as a location for scuba diving. A few meters from Iboih is the Rubiah islet that is known for its coral reefs. There are also several dive operators in Gapang.  Ecosystem  During 1997‚Äì1999, Conservation International conducted a survey of the coral reef in the area. According to the survey, the coral diversity is relatively low, but fish species variation is rich. Some species found during the survey include Pogonoperca ocellata, Chaetodon gardneri, Chaetodon xanthocephalus, Centropyge flavipectoralis, Genicanthus caudovittatus, Halichoeres cosmetus, Stethojulis albovittatus, Scarus enneacanthus, Scarus scaber and Zebrasoma desjardinii. Earthquakes around Aceh and Andaman Sea in 2004 On 13 March 2004, a specimen of the rare and unusual species of shark, megamouth shark, was washed ashore on Gapang beach. Megamouth shark has a distinctive large mouth, very short snout and is broadly rounded in dorsal view. The specimen is said to be the 21st (some say it is the 23rd) sighting of the species since its discovery in 1976. The male shark, measuring in length and weighing 13.82 kg (30.5 pounds), was frozen and sent to the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) for further scientific study. , there have only been 36 findings of megamouth sharks in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami affected the island's ecosystem. At Iboih village, a large swath of mangrove was destroyed. Debris from the land was deposited on the nearby reefs as a result of the tsunami. In 2005, about 14,400 mangrove seedlings were replanted to save the mangrove forest. Apart from underwater ecosystem, Weh island is the only habitat of one threatened species of toad, Duttaphrynus valhallae (formerly Bufo valhallae). The species is only known from the holotype from the island. Due to heavy forestation on the island, the survival of the species is uncertain. Sabang International Regatta Sabang International Regatta was held on September 13 to 25, 2011. The participants were expected from Australia, United States, England, Germany, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Hong Kong. Tourism Weh Island is a small island and some beaches can be visited in one day only by rental vehicles, because there is no public transport. * Anoi Itam Beach, with its black sandy beach, is a half-hour drive from Balohan Port. For a small fee, a visitor can enter Anoi Itam Resort. * Gapang Beach is from Sabang or a 45-minute drive and is convenient for backpackers with white sandy beach, modest culinary stalls and accommodations.

Verumontanum is translated from Latin to mean 'mountain ridge', a reference to the distinctive median elevation of urothelium that characterizes the landmark on magnified views. Embryologically, it is derived from the uterovaginal primordium. The landmark is important in classification of several urethral developmental disorders.

There are a great many brassiere designs that are suitable for a wide variety of business and social settings and suitable to wear with a variety of outer clothing. The bra's shape, coverage, functionality, fit, fashion, fabric, and colour can vary widely. Some bras are designed to offer basic, practical support and coverage while others are purposefully sexual, sensual, or revealing. Manufacturers' bra designs and styles constantly change. There is no standardized system for categorizing bras, and they are made in a wide variety of designs, including those listed here and others like bridal bra, plus size bra, vintage bra, leather bra, belly dance bra. Many bras fulfil more than one purpose, like a balconette bra made of sheer material. __TOC__  List of bra design terms  * Adhesive: Sometimes described as backless/strapless or a stick-on bra. Usually made of silicone, polyurethane, or similar material, they are attached to the underside of the breasts using medical-grade adhesive. Some versions provide one piece for each breast. May be reused for a limited number of times and provides little support. Suitable for backless and strapless outerwear where a strapless bra is not possible or preferred, or as an alternative to going completely braless. * Air: See Water bras below. * Athletic: See Sports bra. * Backless: Suitable for bare-shoulder outer garments like a backless evening gown that exposes the back. * Balconette: The cup cut is horizontal which creates a lift upwards, like a balcony, but not inwards. Sometimes known as a shelf bra. One source equates them to a balcony bra. Lifts the breasts to enhance their appearance, shape, and cleavage. The name means \\"little balcony\\" which refers to the horizontal cut; it is also claimed, less plausibly, that the name comes from the notion that the bra is not visible from above, as when looking down from a balcony. First designed in the United States in about 1938, and came into mainstream fashion in the 1950s. Compare to full-cup and demi-cup bra. * Balcony: Similar to a balconette or demi-cup bra, but the sides are higher and the front is lower exposing more cleavage. * Bandeau: A simple band of material, usually stretchy, that is worn across the breasts. Suitable for small busts, they sometimes have built-in cups, but provide little support or shaping. A band of cloth can sometimes be used to bind the breasts in place. * Belly Dance: Most people consider this type of bra is similar to the normal bra. This type of bra is intended to cover up well e.g., a 32C size can fit up with a 34B belly dance bra. *Big cup: Contrary to common belief, big cup and plus size are not synonymous. Plus size bras refer to the band size that is related to the body weight to body height ratio. Big cup refers only to a large breast size on a body that may be slim. Equating big cup with plus size is therefore misleading. * Bralette: A lightweight, simple design, usually an unlined, soft-cup pullover style bra. The breasts are covered but the bra offers little, if any, real support and is suitable for small busts. Sometimes sold built into a camisole. This style is often used by preadolescent girls as a training bra to conceal the developing nipples and breasts. Similar to bandeau. * Bridal: Designed to be worn under a wedding dress and are generally strapless or adhesive with a longline or integrated corset design. May include lace or embroidery to enhance the newlyweds' experience on the wedding night. * Built-in: Sometimes described as a shelf bra, although completely unlike the shelf bra described below. Contained within or as an integral part of an outer garment like a chemise, swimsuit or tank top. Some built-in bras are detachable. Built-in bras vary in their construction and support ability. Some are bandeau like which offer limited support. The more advanced built-in bras are effectively real bras with padding and underwire with a full fledged support ability, these are mainly intended for larger bust that require sturdier support. * Bullet: A full- support bra with cups in the shape of a paraboloid with its axis perpendicular to the breast. The bullet bra usually features concentric circles or spirals of decorative stitching centred on the nipples. Invented in the late-1940s, they became popular in the 1950s due to \\"sweater girl\\" pin-ups. Madonna wore a bullet bra designed by Jean Paul Gaultier during her Blond Ambition Tour which generated popular interest in vintage fashion. Vintage lingerie company What Katie Did was the first company to put the bullet bra back into production in 1999, and it has again grown in popularity with brands such as Marks and Spencer, Rigby and Peller and Naturana producing their own version of the bullet bra. * Contour: Sometimes referred to as a molded or molded-cup bra, except the contour bra will generally have an underwire not always seen in the molded bra. Contour bras have seamless, pre-formed cups containing a foam or other lining that helps define and hold the cup's shape, even when not being worn. May be available as full-cup, demi-cup, push-up, or in other styles. Can be useful when a women's breasts are asymmetrical (which is common ‚Äì up to 25% of women's breasts are asymmetric ‚Äì or with enlarged or differently shaped nipples who want to create a symmetrical silhouette.) Also see T-shirt bra, below. * Convertible: The bra straps can be detached and rearranged in different ways depending on the outer garment. Alternative strap arrangements include traditional over-the-shoulder, criss-cross, halter, strapless and one- shoulder. * Cupless: See Shelf bra below. * Demi-cup: Sometimes referred to as a half- or shelf bra. A partial-cup bra style that covers from half to three- quarters of the breast and creates cleavage and uplift. Most demi-cup bras are designed with a slight tilt that pushes the breasts towards the centre to display more cleavage. The straps usually attach at the outer edge of the cup. The lingerie industry generally defines a demi-cup bra as covering about above the nipple. The underwire used is shorter and forms a shallower \\"U\\" shape under the cup. Suitable for low-cut outer garments. Compare to full-cup and balconette bra. * Fashion: Defines a category of bras that focus on the look and stylishness of the bra. Highly decorative and colorful bras are typically considered fashion bras and they are available in most of the various styles listed here. * Front-closure: Bras with a single, non-adjustable clasp positioned in the centre front gore between the breasts. Full-coverage cups usually have hook-and-eye instead of claps. This is especially popular for big cup front-closure bras. * Full-coverage: See Full-support bra below. * Full- cup: Sometimes called full-support bras. Designed to offer maximum support and coverage for the entire breast. A practical design for large-busted women. Compare to balconette and demi-cup bra. * Full-figure: See Full-support bra below. * Full-support: Sometimes known as a full-coverage, full-figure or plus-size bra, although these terms are no actually interchangeable. A practical design that offers maximum coverage and support for larger busts. They generally include a sturdier underwire and more supportive, stretchy materials. They typically feature wider shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye fasteners with more hook rows. * Gel: See Water bra below. * Half-: See Demi- cup above. * Half-cup: See Demi-cup above. * Halter: The straps lead up the front of the chest and connect up around the back of the neck making them perfect for backless or halter-type dresses. Some halter bras are also convertible bras. * Hard-cup: Designed for safety. Used in the Saf-t-Bra. * Jogging: See Sports bra. * Leisure: See Sleep bra below. * Liquid: See Water bra below. * Long-line: Extends from the bosom to the waist, offering additional abdominal control and smoothing of the woman's torso. Distributes support over the entire lower torso instead of just the shoulders. *Lounge: See sleep bra. * Male: Worn by men with enlarged breasts. Usually designed to flatten and conceal the breasts rather than to lift and support them. * Mastectomy: Designed to hold a breast prosthesis that simulates a real breast. Suitable after a mastectomy. * Maternity: A full-cup design with wider shoulder straps for maximum support and to reduce bounce. Intended to be worn during pregnancy. A practical design that uses comfortable fabrics that minimize irritation. May be adjustable to allow the cup size to expand as pregnancy progresses. Sometimes referred to as a nursing bra which is typically worn after a baby is delivered, but unlike a true nursing bra, does not utilize removable panels or cups that facilitate nursing an infant. * Medical: Designed to accommodate women who have undergone surgery like mastectomy or breast reduction. * Minimizer: Designed to de-emphasize the bosom, it compresses and flattens the breasts. * Molded: Often compared to a contour bra. The cups are pre-shaped without seams providing a natural, smooth, rounded look under tight fitting clothing. Some are unpadded and may not include an underwire. *Multiway: see convertible bra. * Novelty: A fashion bra designed for appearance and sensuality. May include unusual materials, like leather or feathers. Includes unusual designs like the open-tip, peekaboo, or peephole bra that feature holes or slits in the fabric that reveal the areolas and nipples. Usually made of sensuous material like Lycra, nylon (nylon tricot), polyester, satin, lace or silk. Suitable for erotic situations. * Nude: When defining a style, see Adhesive bra above. When defining a color, it uses material that matched the skin-tone of the woman. * Nursing: Like its sister the maternity bra, this is a practical bra designed with full cups, comfortable fabrics, and wider shoulder straps for increased comfort. Designed to support increased breast size during lactation. Aids breastfeeding by providing flaps or panels that can be unclipped and folded down or to the side, exposing the nipple. Underwires have traditionally been not recommended for nursing bras due to claims they can restrict the flow of milk and cause mastitis, these claims are wrong. Underwires by themselves do not cause problems. Wrong bra size, however, can cause problems, with or without underwire. Some designs utilize stretchable fabric allowing the bra to be pulled to one side to facilitate nursing. * Open-cup: See Shelf bra below. * Padded: Designed to enhance perceived bust size and cleavage. The lining of the cups is thickened and enhanced with shape-enhancing inserts or foam padding inside the entire lining of cup. Padded bras support the breasts but, unlike push-up bras (see below), are not intended to significantly increase cleavage. Also see water bra below. *Peek-a-boo: Intended for romantic occasions, this bra type has cups that can be opened. The cups are made of two parts held together by tied ribbons. * Plunge: Sometimes known as U-plunge bra if they are particularly plunging with a distinct u-shaped opening between the breasts. Allows for lower cleavage. Designed with angled cups and an open and lowered centre gore. The shoulder straps are usually set widely apart. Suitable for dresses or outfits with a deep d√©collet√© or plunging neckline, like a blouse or dress. Also suitable for swimwear, even for women with fuller breasts. Unlike push-up bras, are not generally as heavily padded, as many women with larger breasts wear them. * Plus-size: See Full-support bra above. * Posture: Reinforce correct spinal posture and alignment. * Push-up: A fashion bra that creates the appearance of increased cleavage. Uses angled cups containing padding that pushes the breasts inwards and upwards, towards the centre of the chest. A push-up bra is usually a demi-cup bra. The Wonderbra was the first push-up bra made. * Quarter-cup: See Shelf bra below. * Racerback: Designed with shoulder straps that form a \\"V\\" or \\"T\\" pattern between the shoulder blades. Suitable for outerwear like tank tops that would expose traditional over-the-shoulder straps. Provides extra support and can be used when traditional straps tend to fall off the woman. Many sports bras use a racerback design to improve support and reduce bounce. * Seamless: The cups are smooth and without any visible seams, making them nearly invisible under tight fitting clothing. * Sheer: A fashion bra made of translucent material that reveals the nipples. * Shelf: Sometimes referred to as a cupless, open- cup, half-, or even quarter-cup bra. An underwire fashion design that offers minimal breast coverage, supporting only a portion of the underside of the breast, pushing the breast upward, and leaving the nipple and areola uncovered. Suitable for erotic purposes or when a woman would otherwise want to go braless. The exposed nipples may be visible beneath an outer garment. Built-in bras (see above) are sometimes referred to as a shelf bra or integrate a shelf bra into the material. * Sleep: Sometimes referred to as a leisure bra. These are very soft, stretchy, comfortable easy-to-wear bras that do not provide much support. They may also be suitable as everyday wear for women with a small bust. They are an alternative to going braless and intended for wear at home when relaxing or asleep. With a large bust, bra support may increase comfort during sleep. * Soft cup: A practical design that does not use underwire for support. Traditionally regarded as offering less support than underwire models, soft-cup bras now offer competitive support. This is accomplished by using crisscross frames, inner under-cup slings that rise no more than half the height of the cup itself, and padding or lining the bra cup with 2-ply, molded, lined, or seamed material. * Spacer: Similar to a T-shirt bra, but it includes a breathable foam fabric in the cup reducing sweat inside the cups. * Sports: Designed for athletic activities to provide firm support and minimize breast movement during exercise. Various designs are suitable for a range of exercise, ranging from yoga to running. Usually made of stretchable, absorbent fabric like Lycra, and designed to wick perspiration from the skin to reduce irritation. (For bras worn by girls during puberty, see training bra.) * Stick-on: See Adhesive bra above. * Strapless: A fashion bra that relies on an extra-wide band for breast support. Achieve their strength through a longer underwire that encompasses more of the breast, and cups with added padding, boning, and shaping panels. Suitable for bare- shoulder outer garments like a strapless evening gown that exposes the shoulders and chest, as low as the tops of the areola. Some convertible bras (see above) allow straps to be removed, making a strapless bra. It may have rubberized or silicone beading inside the top edge of the cup to help keep the bra attached to the breast. An alternative when an outfit would otherwise prevent a bra being worn. * T-shirt: Designed without raised seams, hooks, or other construction that can be seen under an outer garment. A contoured style that fits the breasts smoothly under tightly fitting T-shirts, sweaters, light-weight knitted fabric, or clingy tops with minimal visibility. The cups may be lined with foam or lightly padded with polyfill to help conceal the nipples. Also see Contour bra, above. * Training: Designed to help conceal adolescent emerging breasts. As a girl's breasts grow larger, usually around Tanner stage III, this style includes regular bras in smaller styles, from 30AAA to 32B. Most styles are a soft-cup, lightweight, unlined design. Some styles are padded to hide the girl's developing breast buds or to increase the perceived size of the girl's breasts. For standard sized bras, see Bralette, above. For athletic-type bras, see sports bra. * Underwire: Many bra designs feature a thin, semi-circular strip of rigid material that helps support the breast. The wire may be made of either metal, plastic or resin. It is sewn into the bra fabric and under each cup, from the center gore to under the wearer's armpit. * Water: Sometimes known as a liquid or gel bra. Contains water- or silicone gel-filled cups that enhance the size of the breasts. Air bras were a similar concept.

History On May 1, 1701, Simon Van Ness, Gerebrand Clawson, Hans Spier, Elias Franson, Christopher Steinmets, Andrese Louwrentz, Garret Vanderhoof, Hessell Pieters and Jan Spier bought from the Indians a large tract of land at Horseneck.N.J. Secretary of State, Deeds, Surveys, and Commissions. Symon Vanness, et al. from Indians Deed Book O, p. 149+ Date: 5-1-1701 - Essex County In 1702, settlers purchased the 14,000 acre (57 km2) Horseneck Tract from the Lenape Native Americans for goods equal to $325. This purchase encompassed much of western Essex County, from the First Mountain to the Passaic River. Settlement began about 1740 by Thomas Gould and Saunders Sanders. The reason for calling the region \\"Horse Neck\\" has never been determined, but is not because of its shape. The area was referred to as the Horseneck Tract until February 17, 1787, when the congregation of the First Presbyterian Church at Horseneck voted to change the name of their parish to Caldwell, in honor of Reverend James Caldwell who helped them organize the church. After this date the church became known as the First Presbyterian Church at Caldwell. In 1798 the westernmost portion of Newark Township, including the Parish of Caldwell, was renamed Caldwell Township. Caldwell Borough contained what is today the towns of West Caldwell and Caldwell. Soon after, the area of Caldwell Township just to the east of Caldwell Borough between Caldwell Borough and Montclair (present-day Verona and Cedar Grove) decided to follow Caldwell's lead and incorporated itself as its own borough, Verona. Some of the already-developed eastern neighborhoods of Caldwell Township chose to become part of Montclair, as it was a rapidly developing suburb of Newark and Paterson. At around the same time, the area north of Caldwell Borough became its own town, North Caldwell. The wooded area directly to the southeast of downtown Caldwell Borough became Essex Fells, while the farmland to the south of Caldwell township was briefly called South Caldwell. This area underwent other changes when the towns of Livingston and West Orange expanded. The South Caldwell region, still part of Caldwell Township became Roseland. At this point, all that remained of the original Caldwell Township was a large piece of undeveloped land in the northwesternmost part of Essex County; eventually, in the early 1960s, Caldwell Township changed its name to Fairfield in order to avoid being confused with Caldwell Borough.

It was written in the summer of 1964, first performed live on October 10, 1964, and recorded on January 15, 1965. It is described by Dylan biographer Howard Sounes as a \\"grim masterpiece\\". The song features some of Dylan's most memorable lyrical images. Among the well-known lines sung in the song are \\"He not busy being born is busy dying,\\" \\"Money doesn't talk, it swears,\\" \\"Although the masters make the rules, for the wisemen and the fools\\" and \\"But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.\\" The lyrics express Dylan's anger at the perceived hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, and war mentality in contemporary American culture. Dylan's preoccupations in the lyrics, nevertheless, extend beyond the socio-political, expressing existential concerns, touching on urgent matters of personal experience. Dylan said that \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" is one of his songs that means the most to him, and he has played the song often in live concerts. Since its original release on Bringing It All Back Home, live versions of the song have been issued on The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall, Before the Flood, The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings, and Bob Dylan at Budokan. Dylan can also be seen performing the song in the film Dont Look Back and the video of the HBO special Hard to Handle. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, including Roger McGuinn, the Byrds, Billy Preston, Hugo Race, Terence Trent D'Arby, Mick Farren, Caetano Veloso, Marilyn Scott, and The Duhks. Bob Dylan's version Dylan wrote \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" in the summer of 1964. Although he was prepared to take his time developing the song, as he did with \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", he finished it in time for inclusion on the Bringing It All Back Home album, which was recorded in January 1965. Dylan first performed \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" live on October 10, 1964 at Philadelphia Town Hall. The version included on Bringing It All Back Home was recorded on January 15, 1965, the same day that the other three songs on side 2 of the album (\\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", \\"Gates of Eden\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\") were recorded, with Tom Wilson producing. It was long thought that the four songs that make up side 2 of Bringing It All Back Home were recorded in one long take. This is not true, but \\"Gates of Eden\\" was recorded in a single take and \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" was recorded in one take after a single false start (the false start can be heard on both the 6-disc and 18-disc versions of The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965‚Äì1966, released in 2015). Dylan biographer Howard Sounes described \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" as a \\"grim masterpiece.\\" The only accompaniment is Dylan's guitar, playing folk-blues riffs and up and down chord progressions. Author Sean Wilentz has noted that the song's chord structure is similar to that used by the Everly Brothers in their hit recording of \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\". The lyrics of \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" express Dylan's anger at what he sees as the hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, and war mentality inherent in contemporary American culture, but unlike those in his earlier protest songs, do not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions. In his book Bob Dylan, Performing Artist, author Paul Williams has suggested that the song addresses \\"the possibility that the most important (and least articulated) political issue of our times is that we are all being fed a false picture of reality, and it's coming at us from every direction.\\" Williams goes on to say that the song successfully paints a portrait of an \\"alienated individual identifying the characteristics of the world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its 'rules'.\\" As such, a major target in the song is the old, established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted. While it shares a sense of prevailing entropy with the previous song on the album, \\"Gates of Eden\\", the critique in \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" is more direct and less allusive. Author Michael Gray has commented that although the vitriol Dylan unleashes towards his targets is similar to his earlier political protest songs, \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" is a transitional song in that it does not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions. Instead, Dylan sings in a new prophetic voice that would become his trademark. However, with the political pessimism comes a more poetic vision than in his earlier protest songs, along with a more complex figurative language. Howard Sounes notes that the song features some of Dylan's most memorable images. The opening lines begin the song's torrent of apocalyptic images: :Darkness at the break of noon :Shadows even the silver spoon :The handmade blade, the child's balloon :Eclipses both the sun and moon :To understand you know too soon :There is no sense in trying Critic Andy Gill links the opening line of the song to the title of Arthur Koestler's bleak novel Darkness at Noon, set in the Great Stalinist purge of 1938 in Soviet Russia. For Gill, Dylan is suggesting that the human spirit can be cast into darkness by the dead hand of communism as well as by American capitalism. According to Seth Rogovoy, this opening echoes the Book of Ecclesiastes (1:17), which reads, \\"I observed all deeds beneath the sun, and behold all is futile.\\" There are echoes of Ecclesiastes throughout the song. Another example is: :Although the masters make the rules :For the wise man and the fools The author of Ecclesiastes laments (2:15-16) \\"The fate of the fool will befall me also; to what advantage, then, have I become wise? But I come to the conclusion that this, too, was futility, because the wise man and the fool are both forgotten. The wise man dies, just like the fool.\\" One of the most famous lines from the song reminds listeners that even the most powerful people will ultimately be judged: :But even the president of the United States :Sometimes must have to stand naked These lines seemed particularly prescient when Dylan performed the song on his 1974 tour with the Band, a few months before Richard Nixon resigned as President of the United States as a result of the Watergate crisis. After the song has confronted sex, religion and politics, it ends with the lines: :And if my thought-dreams could be seen :They'd probably put my head in a guillotine :But it's alright, Ma, it's life and life only Dylan's preoccupations in the lyrics extend beyond socio-political commentary, and touch on urgent matters of personal experience‚Äîthe challenge to live and grow in the face of uncertainty. :He not busy being born is busy dying Jimmy Carter would later refer to the line in his presidential nomination speech at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, though it addresses matters of the self which supersede politics, in the process displaying certain themes associated with existentialism. Throughout the song, the words pour out quickly, with Dylan barely taking a breath between lines, so that the intricate rhyming structure is often missed: AAAAAB CCCCCB DDDDDB in the verses and AAB in the chorus. Dylan has cited \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" as one of his songs that means the most to him. In 1980 he said, \\"I don't think I could sit down now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again. I wouldn't even know where to begin, but I can still sing it.\\" In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, \\"I've written some songs that I look at, and they just give me a sense of awe. Stuff like, 'It's Alright, Ma,' just the alliteration in that blows me away.\\" \\"It's Alright, Ma\\" has featured in Dylan's live concerts throughout his long career. Dylan's website reports that, as of March 2015, Dylan performed the song 772 times in concert. Concert performances of the songs have been released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall (recorded on October 31, 1964), Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections (recorded on April 30, 1965), Before the Flood (recorded on February 14, 1974), The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings (recorded on November 4, 1975), and Bob Dylan at Budokan (recorded on February 28, 1978). In addition to playing the song live regularly in the 1960s and 1970s, Dylan has included it in his Never Ending Tour from the late 1980s up to the present. Footage of Dylan playing \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" in May 1965 is included in the film Dont Look Back, and a live performance of Dylan playing the song with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers on February 25, 1986 is included in the video of the HBO special Hard to Handle. Dylan also sang this song at his October 16, 1992 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration at Madison Square Garden, which was released on The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration album. The studio recording was re-released on the 2008 compilation album Playlist: The Very Best of Bob Dylan '60s. Cover versions A widely known cover of \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" is that performed by Roger McGuinn for the soundtrack of the 1969 film, Easy Rider. One of the film's scriptwriters, the star, Peter Fonda, had originally intended to use Dylan's version of the song in the film but after failing to secure the appropriate licensing he asked McGuinn to record a cover of it instead. McGuinn's version of the song included on the Easy Rider soundtrack album, features McGuinn on guitar and vocals, accompanied by his bandmate from The Byrds, Gene Parsons, on harmonica. The Byrds also recorded a version of the song during the 1970 recording sessions for their album (Untitled) but it was not included in the final track listing. The Byrds occasionally performed the song in concert during 1970 and a live recording of it, from a March 1, 1970 appearance at the Felt Forum, was included on the 2000 remaster of the (Untitled) album, which was re-titled as (Untitled)/(Unissued). This version also appears as a bonus track on the 2002 remastered version of the compilation album, The Byrds Play Dylan, and on the 2006 4-disc box set There Is a Season. In 1971, Nannie Porres included \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" on her album I Thought About You and in 1973 Billy Preston included the song on Everybody Likes Some Kind Of Music. Artists who have covered the song since then include Hugo Race, Terence Trent D'Arby, Mick Farren, Caetano Veloso, Marilyn Scott, The Duhks, and Ground Components. In 2014, Lee Abramson covered \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" on his band's album Blood. Influence Clinton Heylin, in his biography Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited, wrote that the recording \\"opened up a whole new genre of finger-pointing song, not just for Dylan but for the entire panoply of pop.\\" Heylin adds that \\"It's Alright, Ma\\" probably contained more \\"memorable aphorisms\\" than any of Dylan's songs. One of these lines is \\"he not busy being born is busy dying,\\" from the song's second verse, which was used by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. During his presidential campaign in 2000, Al Gore told talk show host Oprah Winfrey that this was his favorite quotation. Writer and journalist Christopher Hitchens quoted from the song's lyrics in his last article for Vanity Fair, written shortly before his death from esophageal cancer. Hitchens posted at the top of his essay the verse of \\"It's Alright Ma\\" that ends with the words \\"That he who is not busy being born is busy dying\\". Another memorable line is \\"Money doesn't talk, it swears,\\" which appears in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. In addition, the Columbia Dictionary of Quotations lists this as well as three other lines from the song: \\"Although the masters make the rules, for the wisemen and the fools,\\" \\"But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked\\" and \\"Everything from toy guns that spark to flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark, it's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.\\" Other well-known lines include \\"Propaganda, all is phony\\" and \\"Advertising signs they con you into thinking you're the one.\\" In a 2005 reader's poll reported in Mojo magazine, \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" was listed as the #8 all-time greatest Bob Dylan song, and a similar poll of artists ranked the song at #21. In 2002, Uncut magazine listed it as the #5 all-time Dylan song. The song was featured in the final episode of The Sopranos. It has also been referenced by other songwriters. For instance, the indie-rocker Stephen Malkmus quotes \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" at the end of his song \\"Jo-Jo's Jacket\\" from his debut solo album.

Smilin' Ed McConnell (born James McConnell; 1882 - July 23, 1954) was a radio personality, best known as the host of the children's radio and television series, Smilin' Ed's Gang, closely identified with its sponsor, Buster Brown shoes, and also known as The Buster Brown Program. For his work in radio, McConnell was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Early life Born James McConnell in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of a minister, McConnell began to sing at age three and soon learned how to play drums and the piano. He was athletic as a teenager, and after attending William Jewell College, he became a professional boxer. He enlisted in the United States Army during World War I. According to an NBC press release, \\"A troop train on which he was traveling was wrecked in Arkansas by a German sympathizer and Ed wound up in a river. When he was pulled out, an Army surgeon pronounced him dead, but a buddy finally revived Ed with artificial respiration.\\" Radio After his discharge from the Army, McConnell was a gospel vocalist with several evangelists. He entered radio in Atlanta in 1922 as a substitute when a scheduled performer failed to arrive. He married in 1928, and four years later joined the CBS network. In 1937, he moved to NBC as their \\"Sunshine Melody Man\\", offering hymns and uplifting messages. McConnell‚Äôs blend of \\"songs, humor and philosophy\\" aired over network affiliates at 5:30pm. Guests included the Doring Trio, The Four Grenadiers, The Campus Choir and the Rhythmaires. In 1936, McConnell was featured in Acme Sunshine Melodies on WMAQ in Chicago. The Sunday afternoon program was sponsored by Acme White Lead and Color Works.Sies, Luther F. (2014). Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960, 2nd Edition, Volume 1. McFarland & Company, Inc. pg. 11. McConnell became known in New York City when he was heard over WJZ, though the show was broadcast from Chicago and he lived in Elk Rapids, Michigan. McConnell's time-slot and sponsors also changed. For a while, he was heard at 10:30 am doing a 15-minute program sponsored by the Air Conditioning Training Corporation of Youngstown, Ohio. Variety noted that aside from such hymns as \\"God Understands,\\" he \\"unloads a hokey hodgepodge of songs and you-know-me-I wouldn't-steer-you- wrong-blather.\\" McConnell grabbed children's attention when he created the character Froggy the Gremlin, performing with Irma Allen on the organ or Del Owen on the piano. Even though McConnell became famous as \\"Smilin' Ed,\\" he continued to host programs for religious adults. While his Buster Brown show was running, McConnell presided over a five-minute show sponsored by the American Poultry Journal. It reached over 50 stations. Variety said: > \\"Anyone who's been laboring under the impression that a dash of American > folk music and a hymn or two is strictly for farm listeners is apparently > off the beam, because here's a series of 48 shorties that two metropolitan > stations - Chicago's NBC flagship, WMAQ and Minneapolis' WCCO-CBS have > latched on to for a 16 week ride ... Packaged by E. H. Brown Agency for > American Poultry Journal, (transcription) disks which feature two songs > apiece by Smilin' Ed McConnell, with Irma Glen accompanying on the Hammond, > are blanketing the east and midwest now. McConnell plugs the mag (\\"If you've > got a poultry problem, write to APJ's Problem Corner and get a personal > reply from the editor...send in a subscription too, only 50 cents for two > years!\\") and sings... Cornfed delivery of a song like \\"Come Along My Mandy\\" > and hymn \\"When Cares of Life Distress You\\" on one platter, cues the general > format, but the star of NBC's live \\"Buster Brown Show\\" knows how to put over > the old \\"neighborly feeling.\\" And he's no slouch at plugging the Journal, it > might be added. Another Smilin' Ed show was a 15-minute program sponsored by the Purity Baking Company. The Variety review went as follows: > \\"One of the veterans of radio, Ed McConnell mines the rich veins of American > sentiment among those who are white-haired, churchgoing, rural and simple. > He has a disarming style that has been analyzed in these columns on previous > occasions and for other sponsors. This show differs only that he sticks to > hymns and is necessarily serious in comment, with none of the semi-light > folksy gab he could more appropriately introduce in a framework not devoted > to ecclesiastical music alone. Aiming at a selective audience, the program > will no doubt do well. McConnell puts it on a personal basis. Even while > telling his listeners this is one program that will not \\"be cluttered up > with long-winded advertising\\" he is sledge-hammering the important thought - > his listeners need to support his sponsors. \\"My friends who love me will > support me by buying Tasty Bread\\" he announces...\\" > \\"McConnell has a good Epworth League baritone and a down home rhetorical > sloppiness. It's \\"you-all\\" or \\"ya\\" and no fuss. In fact, this is about the > most calculatedly unpretentious program of the season. McConnell is probably > the most humble man in America, making $100,000 or better, a year.\\" In the early 1930s Smilin' Ed McConnell promoted Aladdin Kerosene Lamps with remarkable success over WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio. He became a well-known radio personality as \\"The Aladdin Lamp Man\\", who sang songs, told stories and sold Aladdin lamps over the air. By 1948, 145 ABC stations were subscribing to his 15-minute programs. Smilin' Ed's humor, songs, and music were condensed into a five-minute program especially for electric lamp dealers. So it is very likely that this series originated after 1948. =The Buster Brown Show= For The Buster Brown Show, Ed had support from producer Frank Ferrin, writer Hobart Donavan (who also wrote the Buster Brown comic book giveaways) and director Arthur Jacobson. When Ed started this show, some radio listeners recalled Buster Brown faintly from a 1929 DBS radio series. By the time Smilin' Ed got his kiddie show, Buster Brown was no longer well remembered as a comic strip because the character was merely the trademark symbol for a shoe company. Buster Brown and Smilin' Ed were joined together in 1944, with \\"Smilin' Ed's Buster Brown Gang\\" taking to the airwaves on September 2. The show continued on NBC radio every Saturday morning at 11:30 through April 11, 1953. There was an adventure story to open the show, plugs for Buster Brown shoes, and Froggy the Gremlin might sing a song or annoy a guest, such as Shortfellow the Poet or Alkali Pete the Cowboy. The character \\"Midnight the Cat\\" actually spoke a few lines on the show and Smilin' Ed was always prone to sing a novelty song or two by plunking his magic twanger. The term \\"plunking\\" may have come from McConnell's habit of plunking the strings on his piano to emphasize some of the action in his stories. McConnell was the voice of Froggy, putting on a low, gruff, Popeye-like croak. However, whenever McConnell had to sing a duet with Froggy, announcer Archie Presby was the voice of Froggy. And when there was a live audience, Archie would sometimes dress up in a frog costume and carry on to the delight of the screaming kids. The cast included June Foray and John Dehner. The cast took part in the adventure stories. Foray was called upon to voice \\"Midnight\\" and \\"Old Grandie the Piano\\", and Bud Tollefson, the sound effects engineer, growled the voice of \\"Tige the Dog.\\" Child actor Patrick Curtis (Baby Beau Wilkes in \\"Gone With The Wind\\") played Buster Brown in 1949-50. \\"That's my dog Tige, he lives in a shoe, I'm Buster Brown, look for me in there too!\\" Smilin' Ed used the show to promote not only the Buster Brown shoes but also the comic books, which featured McConnell and usually a little story involving the \\"Buster Brown Gang\\" of Midnight, Squeaky and Froggy. Television Smilin' Ed MConnell and His Buster Brown Gang debuted on NBC on August 26, 1950 and ran through May 1951. From August 1951 to April 1953, the show moved to CBS, and it then moved to ABC from August 1953 to April 23, 1955. Death Smilin' Ed McConnell died on July 23, 1954, at Newport Beach, California, as a result of a heart attack. Tribute * Buckner & Garcia paid homage to these characters on a 1982 novelty song about the arcade game Frogger called \\"Froggy's Lament\\" from their album Pac-Man Fever with its lyrics \\"Hiya kids\\" and \\"Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy!\\".

Description It reached a size of , the wing length was , the length of the tail was and the length of the culmen . It was generally greenish yellow with chestnut-coloured flanks and a conspicuous white eye-ring. The forehead and a line above the eyes were yellow. The top of the head and the back were yellow olive. The wings and the tail were black and the underparts were pale yellow. It was similar in appearance to the Mayotte race of the Malagasy white-eye (Zosterops maderaspatanus mayottensis). Nothing is known of its ecology. Distribution and habitat It is known with certainty only from the small granitic islet of Marianne Island () in the Seychelles about east of La Digue. Reports that it also occurred on Praslin, La Digue, Silhouette Island and Mah√© are unconfirmed. Due to the habitat destruction through agricultural development it apparently became extinct between 1870 and 1900 (according to IUCN around 1888). An expedition in 1940 led by Irish zoologist Desmond Vesey-Fitzgerald failed to find it. There is one specimen in the Natural History Museum in London. Footnotes References * Greenway, James C.

Based in Denmark, the IRCT is the umbrella organization for 144 independent torture rehabilitation organizations in over 70 countries that treat and assist torture survivors and their families. They advocate for holistic rehabilitation for all victims of torture, which can include access to justice, reparations, and medical, psychological and psycho-social counseling. The IRCT does this through to strengthening the capacity of their membership, enabling an improved policy environment for torture victims, and generating and share knowledge on issues related to the rehabilitation of torture victims. Professionals at the IRCT rehabilitation centers and programs provide treatment for an estimated 100,000 survivors of torture every year. Victims receive multidisciplinary support including medical and psychological care and legal aid. The aim of the rehabilitation process is to empower torture survivors to resume as full a life as possible. In 1988, IRCT, along with founder Inge Genefke, was given the Right Livelihood Award \\"for helping those whose lives have been shattered by torture to regain their health and personality.\\" History The medical response to the problem of torture began in 1973 with the launch of a campaign by Amnesty International (AI) to help and diagnose torture victims. At this time, very little was known about torture methods or the physical or psychosocial consequences for torture victims. The first AI group to start this work was founded in Denmark in 1974 and consisted of four voluntary doctors. This group was part of a network of some 4,000 medical doctors from 34 countries worldwide. It quickly became evident that, in addition to documenting cases of torture for use in potential legal proceedings, it was also critical to identify methods to help treat and rehabilitate victims of torture. This resulted in the establishment in 1978 of the first medical international working group to address the rehabilitation of torture victims, which held the first international medical seminar on torture, Violations of Human Rights ‚Äì Torture and the Medical Profession, in Athens, Greece.Violations of Human Rights: Torture and the Medical Profession, New England Journal of Medicine. In 1979, members of the Danish medical group obtained permission to admit and examine torture victims at Copenhagen University Hospital, in Denmark. Three years later, in 1982, the Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims (RCT) was founded in Copenhagen by Dr. Inge Genefke, MD, as an independent institution with its own premises. In response to a growing need for global support and assistance in the rehabilitation of torture victims, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims was founded in 1985, initially as the international arm of the RCT, and, from 1997, as an international and independent organization. In 2010, the IRCT celebrated its 25th anniversary. Members Work The work of the IRCT can be divided into three areas: * Offering rehabilitation services to torture survivors * Countering impunity for perpetrators and promoting justice for survivors * Raising awareness among policy-makers and citizens The stated vision of the IRCT is \\"a world that values and accepts shared responsibility for the eradication of torture\\". The objective of the organization is to promote the provision of specialized treatment and rehabilitation services for victims of torture and to contribute to the prevention of torture globally. To further these goals, the IRCT seeks on an international basis: * to develop and maintain an advocacy programme that accumulates, processes and disseminates information about torture as well as the consequences and the rehabilitation of torture * to establish international funding for rehabilitation services and programmes for the prevention of torture * to promote the education and training of relevant professionals in the medical as well as social, legal and ethical aspects of torture * to encourage the establishment and maintenance of rehabilitation services * to establish and expand institutional relations in the international effort to abolish the practice of torture * to support all other activities that may contribute to the prevention of torture, and * to promote knowledge of and use of the Istanbul Protocol to promote access to torture survivors to high-quality medico-legal, or forensic, documentation of torture for use in legal proceedings. The IRCT has special consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council and the UN Department of Public Information, and participatory status with the Council of Europe.List of non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council as of 1 September 2010, United Nations. Important collaboration partners include (but are not limited to) the World Medical Association (WMA), the World Confederation of Physical Therapy (WCPT), the World Psychiatric Association (WPA), the International Council of Nurses (ICN), and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR).

Biography Dave Dowle started his career when he was 13: he joined his first band, Canterbury Glass, playing alongside future Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett. According to Dowle, the band recorded a Radio One session after meeting the late John Peel DJing at a gig. Following Canterbury Glass, he worked with a variety of artists including Doris Troy and PP Arnold before forming a band called Curly who also recorded a John Peel session in November 1973. Steve Farr and Stewart Blandameer from Curly both ended up in the Q-Tips with Paul Young, with Blandameer also working with Status Quo. Dowle next worked with Brian Auger's Oblivion Express, touring the US and appearing on the Reinforcements album in 1975. In September 1976, Dowle joined the Streetwalkers replacing Nicko McBrain, and this line-up of Dowle, Brian Johnston, Roger Chapman, Charlie Whitney, Bobby Tench and Micky Feat released a studio album, 'Vicious But Fair' in January 1977. By the end of '77, however, the band had run out of steam, and a live album, released in December 1977, proved to be their final release. In January 1978, Dowle joined ex-Deep Purple singer David Coverdale in his new band Whitesnake. Joining David Dowle in the band was another ex-member of the Streetwalkers, keyboard player, Brian Johnston, although he would be replaced within a couple of months by Pete Solley. The rest of the band was Coverdale on vocals, Micky Moody and Bernie Marsden on guitars and Neil Murray on bass. This line-up recorded the 'Snakebite' EP, which was released in June 1978. By August 1978, another change of keyboard player was announced with Coverdale's old Purple buddy Jon Lord adding his considerable experience to the band. This line-up undertook a major UK tour in October and November 1978 and released an album Trouble in December of that year. Whitesnake then undertook a world tour, which served notice of a major new band on the scene. Another album, Lovehunter, was recorded, but in July 1979, even before the album was released, Dowle was replaced by Ian Paice, yet another ex-member of Deep Purple. Dowle's final appearance on a Whitesnake recording was on two sides of Live... in the Heart of the City released in 1980. After departure from Whitesnakee, Dowle continued to play on sessions. \\"I was really a session player.

Playing career Evando was born in Tim√≥teo, Minas Gerais, but represented Vit√≥ria as a youth. He made his first team debut during the 1995 season in the S√©rie A, aged only 18. In January 1997, Evando moved abroad and joined Spanish Segunda Divisi√≥n side Villarreal CF on loan until June. He made his debut abroad on 23 February by starting in a 3‚Äì1 home win against CD Toledo, but only featured in three further matches before returning to his parent club. In 1998, Evando joined Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es of the Primeira Liga on loan for one year. Upon returning, he spent a six-month spell at Goi√°s also in a temporary deal before being bought outright by the Portuguese side in early 2000. Evandro rarely settled into a team in the following campaigns, being loaned to Santa Cruz, Portuguesa Santista and Estrela Amadora before leaving Vit√≥ria in 2004 as his contract expired. He immediately returned to Brazil and signed for Ava√≠. On 12 January 2005, after scoring nine goals in the previous campaign, Evando signed for Santos, but left the club in May and joined Ponte Preta. In December, he agreed to a deal with Fluminense. Evando returned to Ava√≠ for 2007, but soon moved abroad and joined Al-Shamal. In the following year, he rejoined his previous club for a third spell, before moving back to Ponte in June 2009. He then represented Mirassol and N√°utico before rejoining Ava√≠ in February 2011. In 2012, after representing Ituano and Gr√™mio Barueri during the year, Evando retired at the age of 35 with his main club Ava√≠. Coaching career Immediately after retiring Evando continued to work for his last club Ava√≠, helping in the coordination of the club's football schools across the Santa Catarina state. Ahead of the 2015 season, he became the club's permanent assistant manager.

Kincaid (October 23, 1934 ‚Äì July 17, 2011) was a news correspondent for ABC News and local news anchor for WVEC in Norfolk, Virginia for over 18 years.  Biography and early career  Kincaid was born on October 23, 1934 in Houston, Texas, to the late Herbert and Ethel Schulze. His mother was an avid amateur painter of flowers. He grew up in Arkansas, often joking that his parents \\"moved there as soon as they heard about it\\". He started working for a radio station there in 1949, then served three years in the United States Army after being drafted in 1956. In 1960, he joined WWL in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he won a National Gold Bell award for his reporting on the death of Pope John XXIII in 1963. He later moved to what was then KMOX-TV (now KMOV) and WCBS-TV before moving to ABC News. Married three times, two of his marriages ended in divorce.  Network correspondent  Hired to work as a network correspondent, Kincaid reported in Vietnam for ABC in 1969, at the height of the Vietnam War. A military helicopter in which Kincaid was riding was shot down by rocket fire near the village of Bu Dop. He sustained a broken back in the crash and spent several months recovering in Hong Kong.  WVEC-TV  In 1978, Kincaid left ABC to become the local news anchor for WVEC. During his time with WVEC, he returned to Vietnam to do a special series of stories covering the changes that had taken place over the previous 25 years. While shooting the award-winning documentary, Kincaid reunited a Vietnamese refugee with her family in Ho Chi Minh City. The woman, Norfolk resident Thao Nguyen, left Vietnam by boat in the 1970s with her infant daughter, and had not seen her family in over 20 years. Kincaid also wrote a documentary in 1995 entitled \\"D-Day to VE Day\\". Three D-Day veterans from the Norfolk area accompanied Jim to several historic World War II sites, including Weymouth, England, Omaha Beach, Bastogne, the Dachau concentration camp, and Margraten in the Netherlands, site of the largest American cemetery in Europe. In 1996, Kincaid stepped down as WVEC's primary news anchor; he continued with the station as a commentator until his retirement.http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA- Pilot/issues/1996/vp960522/05220048.htm Jim Kincaid ‚Äî For over 17 years, he has been the \\"dean\\" of broadcasters\\" for Hampton Roads.

He is best known as a blues guitarist and also for being the first lead guitarist of The Yardbirds. Topham left the band before they achieved mainstream popularity and was replaced by Eric Clapton, the first of three lead guitarists from the Yardbirds to gain an international reputation (the other two being Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page). Aside from his musical career, Topham also works as an interior designer and painter. Biography In May 1963, Topham and his friend at secondary school, Chris Dreja, visited the Railway Hotel in Norbiton. The hotel's entertainment featured traditional jazz music in the upstairs lounge, and allowed budding musicians to play during the breaks. There, he and Dreja met singer and harmonica player Keith Relf, bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, and drummer Jim McCarty and decided to form The Yardbirds, with Topham as lead guitarist. Two weeks later they played their first gig at the Eel Pie Island, supporting the Cyril Davies All-Stars. Two months after the formation of the Yardbirds, Giorgio Gomelsky offered them the residency at the Crawdaddy Club and became their manager. As the Yardbirds had to turn professional, Topham faced parental disapproval coupled with the anxiety of abandoning his art studies. He could not devote himself to the Yardbirds full-time and he left. His replacement was a fellow art student from the same secondary school, Eric Clapton. Topham recalls, \\"I was only 15 then, three or four years younger than the rest, and there was no way my parents would let me go out five or six nights a week to play music, even though I was already bringing home double what my father was earning. I was going on to Epsom Art School and they wanted me to take it seriously. Eric Clapton was the obvious person to replace me. Later on I didn't regret leaving because they'd moved away from the blues music that I was interested in. Even if I'd stayed with them to become professional I think I would have left later for the same reasons Eric left.\\" He went on to Art College where he formed bands with his friend Duster Bennett. He joined Winston G and the Wicked (later renamed The Fox), playing alongside Marc Bolan. After a final gig with Winston G at London's Roundhouse, Topham revived his association with Bennett, recording a live album with him. This led to an introduction to Mike Vernon and his Blue Horizon label. Topham became a session musician for Blue Horizon, playing with Peter Green and Christine McVie. Topham recorded a solo album for Blue Horizon, Ascension Heights. While Bennett was touring with John Mayall in 1970, Topham fell seriously ill and had to abandon the music industry again. Upon his recovery two years later he entered the fine arts business, but a chance meeting with Jim McCarty led Topham to return to the blues in 1988. The Topham-McCarty Band was formed and played for two years until Topham decided in July 1990 to pursue country blues. He sessioned on 12-string guitar for the track \\"Broken Waltz Time\\" on the Bill Morrissey album, Night Train (Philo Records). Later, Topham and Jim McCarty teamed again up to contribute the track Drifting for the double album Rattlesnake Guitar: The Music of Peter Green. In the 2000s, Topham guested with the latest edition of the Yardbirds under the co-leadership of McCarty and Dreja, and performed with John Idan in sporadic concerts of his own. He also played alongside eminent boogie-woogie pianist Bob Hall. He officially became a member of the Yardbirds again in 2013, replacing Dreja, who was forced to leave the band for medical reasons. In May 2015, Topham exited the Yardbirds and was replaced by Earl Slick. Discography * 2008 ‚Äî The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions ‚Äî Top Topham - producer : Mike Vernon  Bibliography  * M.

The Moon may be observed by using a variety of optical instruments, ranging from the naked eye to large telescopes. The Moon is the only celestial body upon which surface features can be discerned with the unaided eyes of most people. Optimal viewing times Shadows provide a sense of depth. Contrary to popular belief, the Moon should ideally not be viewed at its full phase. During a full moon, rays of sunlight are hitting the visible portion of the Moon perpendicular to the surface. As a result, there is less surface detail visible during a full moon than during other phases (such as the quarter and crescent phases) when sunlight hits the Moon at a much shallower angle. The brightness of a full moon as compared to a phase where a smaller percentage of the surface is illuminated tends to wash out substantial amounts of detail and can actually leave an afterimage on an observer's eye that can persist for several minutes. First quarter (six to nine days past new moon) is generally considered the best time to observe the Moon for the average stargazer. Shadows and detail are most pronounced along the \\"terminator\\", the dividing line between the illuminated (day side) and dark (night side) of the Moon. Suggested viewing tools =Naked eye= maria and craters labeled Earthshine reflecting off the Moon. The bright region at left is directly illuminated by sunlight, while the rest of the Moon is faintly lit by sunlight reflected off the Earth. Generally, the Moon can be viewed even with the naked eye, however it may be more enjoyable with optical instruments. The primary lunar surface features detectable to the naked eye are the lunar maria or \\"seas\\", large basaltic plains which form imaginary figures as the traditional \\"Moon Rabbit\\" or familiar \\"Man in the Moon\\". The maria cover about 35% of the surface. The contrast between the less reflective dark gray maria and the more reflective gray/white lunar highlands is easily visible without optical aid. Under good viewing conditions, those with keen eyesight may also be able to see some of the following features: #Bright region around Copernicus #Mare Nectaris #Mare Humorum #Bright region around Kepler #Gassendi region #Plinius region #Mare Vaporum #Lubiniesky region #Sinus Medii #Faintly shaded area near Sacrobosco #Dark spot at foot of Mons Huygens #Riphean Mountains Another interesting phenomenon visible with the naked eye is Earthshine. Best visible shortly before or after new a moon (during the waning and waxing crescent phases respectively), Earthshine is the faint glow of the non-illuminated (night) side of the Moon caused by sunlight reflecting off the surface of Earth (which would appear nearly full to an observer situated on the Moon at this time) and onto the night side of the Moon. By the time the Moon reaches first its quarter however, the sunlight illuminated portion of the Moon becomes far too bright for Earthshine to be seen with the naked eye, however it can still be observed telescopically. =Binoculars and telephoto camera lenses= Binoculars are commonly used by those just beginning to observe the Moon, and many experienced amateur astronomers prefer the view through binoculars over that through higher-power telescopes due to the larger field of view. Their high level of portability makes them the simplest device used to see more detail on the lunar surface than what is visible to the naked eye. The primary disadvantage of binoculars is that they cannot be held as steadily unless one utilizes a commercial or homemade binocular tripod. The recent introduction of image-stabilized binoculars has changed this to some extent; however, cost is still an issue. A 10√ó pair of binoculars will magnify the Moon approximately as much as a 200mm camera lens can. The photos below were shot with a 200mm lens. The first photo was taken on 13 November 2016 at 6:20pm PST, observing the full Moon just hours before it would officially become the largest supermoon since 1948. The second photo was shot 24 hours later, and the contrast was enhanced to bring out details such as mountainous terrain. The next supermoon will not occur this large until the year 2034. File:Pre-Super Moon 11-13-2016.jpgPre-supermoon on , at 6:20 pm PST, just a few hours before it would be officially called the \\"Supermoon of 2016\\" File:Super-Moon-3 11-14-2016.jpgSupermoon officially on , at 7:19 pm PST =Telescopes= To some it may be more desirable to utilize a telescope in which case far more options for observing the Moon exist. Even a small, well- made telescope will show the observer much greater detail than is visible with the naked eye or small binoculars. As the aperture of the telescope mirror (in the case of a reflecting telescope) or lens (in the case of a refracting telescope) increases, smaller and smaller features will begin to appear. With large amateur telescopes, features as small as 0.6 miles (1 km) in diameter can be observed depending on atmospheric conditions. Most astronomers use different kinds of filters in order to bring out the contrast of certain surface features. Simple neutral density filters are also common as they can cut down the amount of light reaching the eye by 60‚Äì95%, something that is helpful especially when observing a full or gibbous moon so the surface does not appear as washed out. Lunar occultations Jupiter (the bright object in the upper right) a few minutes before being occulted by the Moon on June 16, 2005 An occultation is an astronomical event where a celestial object appears completely hidden by another, closer body (with a greater angular diameter) due to the passage of the closer object directly between the more distant object and the observer. Due to the large apparent size of the Moon, lunar occultations are quite common and when a bright celestial object is involved, the result is an event that can be easily observed using the naked eye. The Moon almost constantly occults faint stars as it orbits the Earth but because even a young Moon appears immensely brighter than these stars, these events are difficult to observe using amateur telescopes. However, the Moon does frequently occult brighter stars and even planets due to its close proximity to the ecliptic. Four first magnitude stars, Regulus, Spica, Antares, and Aldebaran, are sufficiently close to the ecliptic that they may be occulted by the Moon. In addition, two star clusters visible to the naked eye, the Beehive Cluster and the Pleiades, are often occulted. Depending on one's location on the Earth, there are usually several occultations involving naked eye objects every year and many more that can be observed using binoculars or a telescope. Accurate timings (accuracy at least +/-0.02 seconds) of lunar occultations are scientifically useful in fields such as lunar topography, astrometry, and binary star studies and are collected by the International Occultation Timing Association - IOTA. The archive of lunar occultations observations, (1623 to the present day) are maintained at VizieR. Transient Lunar Phenomena A transient lunar phenomenon (TLP) or \\"Lunar Transient Phenomena\\" (LTP), refers to short-lived lights, colors, or changes in appearance of the lunar surface. Claims of these phenomena go back at least 1,000 years, with some having been observed independently by multiple witnesses or some in the scientific community. Nevertheless, the majority of transient lunar phenomena reports are irreproducible and do not possess adequate control experiments that could be used to distinguish among alternative hypotheses. Few reports concerning these phenomena are ever published in peer reviewed scientific journals, and rightfully or wrongfully, the lunar scientific community rarely discusses these observations. Most lunar scientists will acknowledge that transient events such as outgassing and impact cratering do occur over geologic time: the controversy lies in the frequency of such events. A number of astronomical societies around the world have implemented their own TLP watch programs and TLP alert networks. =Features with reported TLP Associations= Agrippa (crater) Alphonsus (crater) Archimedes (crater) Aristarchus (crater) Aristoteles (crater) Atlas (crater) Alphonsus (crater) Bullialdus (crater) Calippus (crater) Cassini (crater) Censorinus (crater) Clavius (crater) Cleomedes (crater) Copernicus (crater) Eratosthenes (crater) Fracastorius (crater) Gassendi (crater) Grimaldi (crater) Herodotus (crater) Sinus Iridum Kepler (crater) Lambert (lunar crater) Linn√© (crater) Manilius (crater) Mare Crisium Menelaus (crater) Mons Piton Mons Pico Picard (crater) Plato (crater) Posidonius (crater) Proclus (crater) Promontorium Laplace Riccioli (crater) Schickard (crater) Taruntius (crater) Theophilus (crater) Timocharis (crater) Tycho (crater) Vallis Schr√∂teri Zagut (crater) =Blinking devices= A number of observers employ different colored filters to determine colored transient events on the Moon. By quickly alternating filters of opposing colors in the telescopic light path, faintly colored areas on the Moon can stand out more by appearing to flicker on and off. A red area will appear brighter when viewed through a red filter and darker when seen through a blue filter. It is possible to alternate the filters manually however, this requires a certain dexterity of the hand and good coordination. A purpose built filter wheel is much more viable alternative, and this can be motorized, so the observer can devote all of their concentration to what is going on through the eyepiece. There are, however a number of features on the Moon that will appear to blink naturally, among them being the southwestern part of Fracastorius (crater), and a section of the western wall of Plato (crater). A special filter wheel called a \\"crater extinction device\\" is capable of measuring the brightness of an individual lunar feature to be measured according to the point where it ceases to be visible. Crescent Moon During the first two weeks, the Moon is called 'crescent' (when the illuminated portion increases) while it is 'falling' for the next two weeks. For two weeks, the crescent Moon wanes before and waxes after new moon, or \\"change of Moon\\". The Moon when other than crescent or dark, is called a gibbous, waxing before and waning after full moon. Other items of interest Because the Moon is so bright, it is especially interesting to see objects \\"superimposed\\" on it. One particular point of interest is an ISS (International Space Station) transit.

It is a restriction enzyme used in molecular biology laboratories. It was the third endonuclease to be isolated from the Haemophilus aegyptius bacteria. The enzyme's recognition site--the place where it cuts DNA molecules--is the GGCC nucleotide sequence which means it cleaves DNA at the site 5‚Ä≤-GG/CC-3. The recognition site is usually around 4-8 bps.This enzyme's gene has been sequenced and cloned. This is done to make DNA fragments in blunt ends. HaeIII is not effective for single stranded DNA cleavage. Properties HaeIII has a molecular weight of 37126. After a 2-10-fold of Hae III takes place, there is overdigestion of a DNA substrate. This results in 100% being cut, more than 50% of fragments being ligated, and more than 95% being recut. Heat inactivation comes at about 80 ¬∞C for 20 minutes. The locus of the HaeIII enzyme is on AF05137, and is linear with 957 base pairs. History HaeIII along with other restriction enzymes were discovered in 1970 by Werner Arber and Matthew Meselson. The HaeIII methyltransferase also known as MTase gene from Haemophilus aegyptius (recognition sequence: 5‚Ä≤-GGCC-3‚Ä≤) was made into Escherichia coli (E.coli) in the plasmid vector pBR322. The gene was extracted from a single EcoRI fragment and a single HindIII enzyme fragment. Clones carrying additional adjacent fragments were found to code for the HaeIII restriction enzyme. Function The enzyme cleaves the DNA at the positions where the GGCC sequence is found. The cleavage occurs between the second and the third nucleotides (G and C). The resulting DNA fragments are known as restriction fragments. HaeIII cuts both strands of DNA in the same location, yielding restriction fragments with blunt ends. Heat denaturation occurs at 80¬∞C after 20 minutes. Methylase Haemophilus aegyptius also carries a methylase dubbed HaeIIIM () that methylates the internal cytosines in the GGCC sequence. It protects sequences from being cut by HaeIII, and forms a restriction modification system. HaeIII enzyme comes from an E. coli strain that carries the cloned HaeIII modification gene from Haemophilus aegyptius.

This time they did not join the government. On 10 September 1951 the party merged into the General Zionists, then the second- largest party in the Knesset and briefly a member of the governing coalition that made up the fourth and fifth governments (though they were expelled from the sixth after abstaining from a motion of no-confidence).

Oberl√§nder earned a doctorate in agriculture in 1929 and a second doctorate in economics in 1930. He spent time in the Soviet Union during the 1920s and early 1930s, including as an employee of DRUSAG, a German company involved in developing Soviet agriculture in cooperation with the Soviet government. Subsequently, he became active in Ostforschung, area studies of the Soviet Union, the Baltic states, Poland and other countries of Eastern and Central Europe, advocating elimination of Jews and subjugation of Polish people in Poland which in his writings he described as having \\"eight million inhabitants too many\\". In 1933, he became Director of the Institute for East German Economy in K√∂nigsberg, and in 1938 he became Professor of Agriculture at the University of Greifswald. He served as a lieutenant in the German military intelligence service in the Soviet Union during the Second World War and was promoted to captain of the reserve before his discharge in 1943; in the same year he became Director of the Institute for Economic Sciences. From 1944, he was affiliated with the staff of Andrey Vlasov's anti-Stalinist Russian Liberation Army. He became a member of the Nazi Party in 1933. However, from 1937 until the end of Nazi rule, he was under surveillance by the Sicherheitsdienst, as he was suspected of being disloyal to the Nazi cause. In 1940, he endorsed ethnic cleansing of Poland. He later became the leader of the mixed German and Caucasian Bergmann Battalion, which was active in anti-partisan warfare. Both groups were later claimed to have participated in war crimes. After the war, he worked for American intelligence as an expert on Eastern Europe until 1949.Klaus von Wiegrefe: \\"Der seltsame Professor.\\" Der Spiegel 27/2000, 3 July 2000, pp. 62‚Äì66. He entered politics for the liberal Free Democratic Party from 1948. In 1950, he was a co-founder of the All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights and served as its chairman from 1954 to 1955. He served as a member of the Parliament of Bavaria from 1950 to 1953 and as Secretary of State for Refugee Affairs in the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior from 1951 to 1953. He then served as Federal Minister for Displaced Persons, Refugees and Victims of War in the Second and Third Cabinets of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer from 1953 to 1960, and as a Member of the Bundestag from 1953 to 1961 and from 1963 to 1965, during which time he represented Hildesheim from 1957 to 1961. In 1956, Oberl√§nder became a member of the Christian Democratic Union. Oberl√§nder was one of the most staunch anti-communists in the German government. He received the Grand Cross of Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Bavarian Order of Merit and the Legion of Honour. Background and early career Oberl√§nder was born in 1905 in Meiningen, Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, part of the German Empire, to a Protestant family; his father Oskar Oberl√§nder was a civil servant and director of the insurance agency in Th√ºringen. From 1923 to 1927, he studied agricultural science at LMU, the University of Hamburg and the University of Berlin, and earned a master's degree in this field in 1927. In 1928, he spent half a year in the Soviet Union as an employee of DRUSAG, which was involved in developing Soviet agriculture in cooperation with the Soviet government.\\"Oberl√§nder ‚Äì Baustein oder Dynamit.\\" Der Spiegel 17/1954, 21 April 1954 In 1929, he earned a doctorate in agriculture at the University of Berlin with a dissertation titled Die landwirtschaftlichen Grundlagen des Landes Litauen (\\"The agricultural base of the country of Lithuania\\"). In 1930, he earned a doctorate in economics at the University of K√∂nigsberg with the dissertation Die Landflucht in Deutschland und ihre Bek√§mpfung durch agrarpolitische Ma√ünahmen (\\"The rural exodus in Germany and its prevention by agricultural policy measures\\"). From 1930 to 1931, he spent nearly two years in the Soviet Union, China, Canada and the United States, where he worked for the Ford Motor Company. In 1931, Oberl√§nder became an assistant professor at the Institute for East German Economy in K√∂nigsberg, and in 1933 he became Director of the institute. From 1934, he was also Associate Professor of Agriculture at the Technical College of Danzig. He became Associate Professor at the University of K√∂nigsberg in 1937. In 1938, he became Professor of Agriculture at the University of Greifswald. Oberl√§nder wrote several books about the need for German intervention in the agricultural systems of the Soviet Union and Poland, which he considered \\"un-economic\\". During the Nazi regime Oberl√§nder became a member of the NSDAP in 1933, a member of the SA and leader of an NSDAP district.\\"Konrad Adenauer: A German Politician and Statesman in a Period of War, Revolution and Reconstruction : The Statesman : 1952‚Äì1967\\", Hans Peter-Schwarz pages 91, 432, Berghahn Books 1997 On 4 August 1935, he became an assistant to Gauleiter Erich Koch, under whose authority he started to gather information about non-German minorities in East Prussia. A significant role in this process was played by the \\"Bund Deutscher Osten\\" (BDO ‚Äì \\"League for a German East\\"), which advocated radical Germanization of the eastern provinces and the elimination of the Polish language in Masuria. The language's traditional usage in the Protestant churches of the Masurians was outlawed in November 1939, with the Lutheran Prussian Church leadership acquiescing in December. Oberl√§nder had participated in Adolf Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, Bavaria, in 1923 during the Weimar Republic era, already at the age of 18. In March 1935, he attended a meeting of professors, scholars and NSDAP training specialists dedicated to the study of the \\"East\\" where he focused his essays on what he described as \\"border struggle\\" with Poland. The meeting was divided into two groups:‚Äùbase\\" and \\"front\\". The \\"base\\" included 58 professors, lecturers and research assistants, the \\"front\\" was made up of political functionaries, seven training specialists of the NSDAP, the Hitler Youth, three heads of Reichsarbeitsdiensts, two teachers and two civil servants. It was Oberl√§nder who introduced the 72 participants on the first day and set for them the task to study the \\"border struggle\\" against Poland. Attacking Poland, he advocated fighting the Polish minority in Nazi Germany and demanded that social relationships between Germans and Polish immigrants be prohibited. Oberl√§nder implied that Poland was not capable of sociopolitical and agrarian reforms due to the fact that it was not a \\"racially homogenous\\" nation state. He dismissed the population of Polish cities as \\"transplanted rubes\\". Sharing Hitler's views, Oberl√§nder believed that the treaties regarding the East, like the German‚ÄìPolish Non-Aggression Pact, were only conditional, and that Ostforschung studies should go on as usual \\"so that after ten years we have everything ready that we could need in any given circumstances\\".\\"Germany turns eastwards: a study of Ostforschung in the Third Reich\\", Michael Burleigh Cambridge University Press, 1988, pages 76 ,144‚Äì146, 222, 317‚Äì318 Continuing his studies on the rural population of Poland he noted in his works that \\"Poland has eight million inhabitants too many\\". Reflecting on the temporary lack of possibility of open war in the East, Oberl√§nder wrote the following: \\"The struggle for ethnicity is nothing other than the continuation of war by other means under the cover of peace. Not a fight with gas, grenades, and machine-guns, but a fight about homes, farms, schools and the souls of children, a struggle whose end, unlike in war, is not foreseeable as long as the insane principle of the nationalism of the state dominates the Eastern region, a struggle which goes on with one aim:extermination!\\" Other features of Oberl√§nder's thoughts concentrated on depicting Jews as carriers of communism, and the benefits of peasant antisemitism to German goals in Central and Eastern Europe. His preparatory work in the BDO involved monitoring over 1,200,000 Poles living in Germany, with a card-name index of untrustworthy Poles and Germans living in the borderlands, and proposals to Germanise Polish place, street, and family names. In the middle of 1937, Oberl√§nder formulated a \\"divide and conquer\\" strategy for Poland.German scholars and ethnic cleansing 1919‚Äì1945\\" Ingo Haar, Michael Fahlbusch Berghahn Books 2006 page 10, 12 Within Poland, ethnic groups were to be directed into fighting with each other in order to prepare the ground for German rule. The Poles were to be steered away from opposing Germans and guided into confrontation with Russians and Jews. Oberl√§nder additionally called for elimination of \\"assimilated Jewry\\" which in his view carried \\"communist ideas\\". Polish peasants were to be \\"taught\\" that they benefit from German \\"law\\". In order to win over Poles to the side of German hegemony in Europe, Oberl√§nder proposed that they share in the theft of Jewish property. Around 3.5 million Polish Jews and 1.5 million people who were considered \\"assimilated Jews\\" were to be deprived of all of their rights. He is considered by some historians to be among the academics who laid the intellectual foundation for the Final Solution.\\"In pursuit of German memory: history, television, and politics after Auschwitz\\", Wulf Kansteiner Ohio University Press; 2006 page 222-224 By 1937, Oberl√§nder, however, started to lose influence in the Nazi party as his views on the treatment of the Polish population (but not the Jewish question) were losing out to more hardline positions and his personal conflict with Erich Koch.\\"Himmler's Auxiliaries: The Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle and the German National Minorities of Europe, 1933‚Äì1945\\"Valdis O. Lumens page 63 As a result, he had lost his position in East Prussia and within the BDO by 1938. He was essentially fired by the University of K√∂nigsberg, after the Nazi government had attacked the \\"political nature\\" of his work. He was instead appointed Professor of Agriculture at the University of Greifswald, and was ordered to refrain from involving himself in Ostforschung.Werner Zschintzsch: \\"Betrifft: Verwendung des Prof.Dr. Oberl√§nder, zuletzt in K√∂nigsberg\\", letter of 22 December 1937 From 1937 until the end of Nazi rule he was under surveillance by the Sicherheitsdienst, as he was henceforth suspected of being disloyal to the Nazi cause.Victor Silling: Die Hintergr√ºnde des Falles Oberl√§nder. Grenzland Verlag 1960, p. 60‚Äì61. From 1 April 1938, he worked as Professor of History at University of Greifswald. In 1939, Oberl√§nder moved to work in Abwehrstelle Breslau; one of the main centers of sabotage and diversion organised by the Nazis that conducted operations against Poland. At the same time, his work concerned issues connected to Ukraine and the Sudetes region and he had contacts with Osteuropa Institut located in Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw).\\"Przeglad Zachodni\\", volume 16 Instytut Zachodni 1960 page 115 =World War II= In 1940, Oberl√§nder endorsed the ethnic cleansing of the Polish populationhttp://gplanost.x-berg.de/sgplanost.html and, in 1941, wrote in the German magazine Deutsche Monatshefte: \\"We have the best soldier in the world who re-conquered German soil in the East. There is no bigger responsibility than educating this colonist to be the best on earth and to secure the living space for all time to come\\" Oberl√§nder's words echoed the views of Heinrich Himmler, who envisioned settling former soldiers, armed with weapons and ploughs in the East, not just pure peasants.‚ÄùSCHWERTE MUSS DER PFLUG FOLGEN: ≈∞ber-peasants and National Socialists Settlements in the Occupied Eastern Territories during World War Two‚ÄùSimone C. De Santiago Ramos, M.S. Thesis Prepared for the Degree of Master of Arts University of Texas page 68 During 1940 he moved to the University of Prague, after which he became active in Ukraine, where he was used by Nazi Germany's military as an expert on \\"ethnic psychology\\". Biographer Philipp-Christian Wachs describes Oberl√§nder as a \\"German nationalist and anti-communist, but not a national socialist racial fanatic\\"; according to Wachs Oberl√§nder was a pragmatist who wanted to secure the cooperation with Poles and Ukrainians, among others, in order to achieve German political dominance and defeat the Soviet Union.Philipp-Christian Wachs: Der Fall Oberl√§nder (1905‚Äì1998). Ein Lehrst√ºck deutscher Geschichte. Campus Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 2000, . When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Oberl√§nder became an advising officer of the Nachtigall Battalion (a Ukrainian battalion of Wehrmacht) which occupied Lvov in the Ukraine. The participation of the Battalion in The Lvov Civilian Massacre of 1941 has since been subject to controversy, and Oberl√§nder himself was accused after the war of participating in the events. In January 1942, he sent a report on the situation in the Ukraine in which he wrote that success lay in \\"winning over the masses and pitilessly exterminating partisans as deleterious to the people\\". He later became the leader of the mixed German and Caucasian Sonderverband Bergmann, which was active in anti-partisan warfare. Both army groups were later claimed to have participated in war crimes. Oberl√§nder's involvement in the Eastern front would lead to the Oberl√§nder case at the end of the 1950s. In 1943, he was dismissed from the Wehrmacht due to political conflict with his superiors and returned to Prague. In 1944, he joined the staff of Andrey Vlasov's Russian Liberation Army. He was participating to crimes in the Vercors (France), in Chapelle en Vercors and Saint Nazaire en Royans. (5 bis : http://museedelaresistanceenligne.org/media582-MA) He was taken prisoner of war by the United States Army in 1945. Cold War After the war, Oberl√§nder worked for American intelligence as an expert on Eastern Europe until 1949. In his denazification hearing, he was deemed to be an opponent of nazism and categorized as \\"entlastet\\" (acquitted). After the war, Oberl√§nder claimed that he had criticised Nazi policies and personally only wanted German hegemony over Slavic peoples in which they would have \\"some respect\\" and were \\"treated reasonably humanely\\". Oberl√§nder again became active in German politics, first in the liberal Free Democratic Party, then in the Bloc of Refugees and Expellees (GB/BHE)(despite the fact that he himself was not expelled), where he would become a prominent figure alongside another ex-Nazi Waldemar Kraft who had previously been interned for two years for his wartime activities in occupied Poland\\"Shouldering the Burdens of Defeat: West Germany and the Reconstruction of Social Justice\\" Michael L. Hughes, The University of North Carolina Press 1999 The BHE itself was connected in various ways to the Nazis, as it openly tried to win over former NSDAP members angry at denazification, calling their crimes to be only \\"uncritical belief in Germany's future\\". The party classified those Nazis on a par with war-damaged as fellow victims. The fact that it selected as its leaders two ex-Nazis, who had taken part in the expulsion of non-Germans and expropriation of their property severely undermined German complaints about their situation.‚ÄùA World at Arms: A Global History of World War II\\" Gerhard L. Weinberg Cambridge University Press 1995 page 792 Oberl√§nder joined the Adenauer government of West Germany in 1953 as Minister for Refugees and Expellees. His appointment prompted negative press coverage and made details of his Nazi past known. However, despite the fact that he nominated several former Nazis as co- workers, the criticism soon died down. Adenauer in particular was keen on getting the BHE on board, as, with its support, he controlled a two-thirds majority in parliament. Adenauer knew very well that Oberl√§nder was a former National Socialist and admitted he has a \\"very brown past\\" In 1956, when Oberl√§nder tried to visit his former Nazi co-workers, who were still serving time in Landsberg prison, the foreign minister of Germany vetoed the trip, fearing international consequences, nevertheless, despite hindrances, Oberl√§nder still tried to support far right groups.\\"Legacies of Dachau: the uses and abuses of a concentration camp 1933‚Äì2001\\"‚Äû Harold Marcuse Cambridge University Press 2001 page 118 Oberl√§nder left the GB/BHE for the centrist Christian Democratic Union in 1956 when it broke with Adenauer. Adenauer himself continued to support him, as a matter of principle. In the fall of 1959, the Eastern Bloc unleashed a coordinated campaign against the presence of Nazis in the West German government, which included Oberl√§nder. He was accused of participating in the Lvov Massacre. Previously, he had been able to remain active in politics despite the accusations, but the situation this time became more unfavourable, and some of his fellow CDU colleagues pushed for him to resign for the good of the government and country. While many in West Germany did not believe the accusations of war crimes, it was clear that Oberl√§nder had been an enthusiastic Nazi; due to the fact that the West German community had reinvented its image as a community of innocent bystanders during the Second World War, Oberl√§nder's past was considered a liability.

In 1960, Oberl√§nder was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment by an East German court, for his alleged involvement in the Lviv massacre in 1941. In January 1960, during discussions with 3,000 students of University of Cologne, Adenauer was faced with protests against the continued presence of Oberl√§nder in the German government. In response, Adenauer stated that Oberl√§nder was a Nazi but \\"never did anything dishonourable\\". Despite Adenauer's protection, Oberl√§nder became a heavy burden on the German government in May 1960 and finally was forced to resign from the government, but not because of his past but due to the fact that he politically represented no value that was worth the trouble. Oberl√§nder nevertheless continued efforts to influence the German public, and in 1962 published an article in Der Stahlhelm, an organ of the former Frontsoldaten. In it, he repeated claims about a \\"revolutionary war\\" in which he accused the \\"dictatorship in the East\\" of conducting an offensive revolution against the West, in which there was \\"no beginning\\", and no movement of troops, but which was led by \\"infiltration and publicism\\" as well as \\"espionage\\". He denounced any possibility of \\"coexistence\\" between East and West and blamed such ideas on a \\"rootless intelligentsia\\"; Oberl√§nder wrote \\"to appease the enemy\\" was \\"to further world revolution\\". Historian Michael Burleigh notes that the idea that the \\"unfree\\" perhaps didn't wanted to be \\"liberated\\" by the likes of Oberl√§nder and his \\"Bund der Frontsoldaten\\" (who passed that way twenty years ago)-did not occur to him. In 1986, Oberl√§nder received the Bavarian Order of Merit from the state of Bavaria. The GDR conviction of Oberl√§nder was declared null and void by the Berlin Kammergericht in 1993.Philipp-Christian Wachs: Die Inszenierung eines Schauprozesses ‚Äì das Verfahren gegen Theodor Oberl√§nder vor dem Obersten Gericht der DDR, Schriftenreihe des Berliner Landesbeauftragten f√ºr die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen DDR, Vol. 14, p. 13, Berlin 2001. At the end of his life, Oberl√§nder became involved in anti-immigration politics. A preliminary inquiry into Oberl√§nder's role in connection with the unlawful killing of a civilian in Kislovodsk in 1942 during his Bergmann leadership was opened by a district attorney in Cologne in 1996.Der Spiegel 18 / 1996 Kriegsverbrehen. Die M√ºhlen mahlen langsam The allegations involved an interrogation of a female Soviet teacher; it was alleged that she was whipped and, after refusing to talk about suspected partisan activity, shot in the breast by Oberl√§nder, and then left to die. Oberl√§nder called those allegations \\"old Soviet lies\\".Die M√ºhlen mahlen langsam.

It is a silvery fish with unspined fins and a deeply forked caudal fin. The distribution is widely along the California coast from Baja California north to Alaska and the Bering Sea; in Asia the distribution is south to Japan. Clupea pallasii is considered a keystone species because of its very high productivity and interactions with many predators and prey. Pacific herring spawn in variable seasons, but often in the early part of the year in intertidal and sub-tidal environments, commonly on eelgrass, seaweedHerring Spawn on Kelp Photo or other submerged vegetation; however, they do not die after spawning, but can breed in successive years. According to government sources, the Pacific herring fishery collapsed in the year 1993, and is slowly recovering to commercial viability in several North American stock areas.Alaska Fisheries 1998 study The species is named for Peter Simon Pallas, a noted German naturalist and explorer. There are disjunct populations of Clupea pallasii in North-East Europe, which are often attributed to separate subspecies Clupea pallasii marisalbi (White Sea herring) and Clupea pallasii suworowi (Chosha herring). Morphology Pacific herring have a bluish-green back and silver-white sides and bellies; they are otherwise unmarked. The silvery color derives from guanine crystals embedded in their laterals, leading to an effective camouflage phenomenon.Hourston, A.S. and C.W. Haegele, Herring on Canada's Pacific Coast, Canadian Special Publications of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Ottawa (1980) There is a single dorsal fin located mid-body and a deeply forked tail- fin. Their bodies are compressed laterally, and ventral scales protrude in a somewhat serrated fashion. Unlike other genus members, they have no scales on heads or gills;Roger A. Barnhart, Species Profile: Life Histories and Environmental Requirements of Coastal Fishes and Invertebrates (Pacific Southwest): Pacific Herring, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, February, 1988 moreover, their scales are large and easy to extract. This species of fish may attain a length of 45 centimeters in exceptional cases and weigh up to 550 grams, but a typical adult size is closer to 33 centimeters. The fish interior is quite bony with oily flesh. This species has no teeth on the jawline, but some are exhibited on the vomer. Pacific herring have an unusual retinal morphology that allows filter feeding in extremely dim lighting environments. This species is capable of rapid vertical motion, due to the existence of a complex nerve receptor system design that connects to the gas bladder.J.H.S. Blaxter, The Herring: a Successful Fish?, Journal of Canadian Journal of Fish. Aquatic Sci.(suppl. 1) 42:21-30 (1985) Life cycle Juvenile fish Pacific herring prefer spawning locations in sheltered bays and estuaries. Along the American Pacific Coast, some of the principal areas are San Francisco Bay, Richardson Bay, Tomales Bay and Humboldt Bay. Adult males and females make their way from the open ocean to bays and coves around November or December, although in the far north of the range, these dates may be somewhat later. Conditions that trigger spawning are not altogether clear, but after spending weeks congregating in the deeper channels, both males and females will begin to enter shallower inter-tidal or sub-tidal waters. Submerged vegetation, especially eelgrass, is a preferred substrate for oviposition. A single female may lay as many as 20,000 eggs in one spawn following ventral contact with submerged substrates. However, the juvenile survival rate is only about one resultant adult per ten thousand eggs, due to high predation by numerous other species. The precise staging of spawning is not understood, although some researchers suggest the male initiates the process by release of milt, which has a pheromone that stimulates the female to begin oviposition. The behavior seems to be collective so that an entire school may spawn in the period of a few hours, producing an egg density of up to 6,000,000 eggs per square meter.J.D. Spratt, The Pacific herring resource of San Francisco and Tomales Bays: Its size and structure, California Department of Fish and Game Marine Research Tech. 33, 44p (1976) The fertilized spherical eggs, measuring 1.2 to 1.5 millimeters in diameter, incubate for approximately ten days in estuarine waters that are about 10 degrees Celsius. Eggs and juveniles are subject to heavy predation. Fisheries Global capture of Pacific herring in tonnes reported by the FAO, 1950‚Äì2009Clupea pallasii (Valenciennes, 1847) FAO, Species Fact Sheet. Retrieved April 2012. Historically the Pacific herring has been an important species, due to its productive abilities to generate significant species biomass. Biomass estimates have been performed by scuba divers from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game since 1975 but the estimates remain highly variable. Herring has long been fished by First Nations on the Central Coast of British Columbia, and elsewhere. In 1997 the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its decision in the Gladstone decision (R. v. Gladstone)- recognizing a pre-existing aboriginal right to herring that includes a commercial component to the Heiltsuk Nation. Due to overfishing, the total North American Pacific herring fishery collapsed in 1993, and is slowly recovering with active management by North American resource managers. In various sub-areas the Pacific herring fishery collapsed at slightly differing times; for example, the Pacific herring fishery in Richardson Bay collapsed in 1983.Patrick Sullivan, Gary Deghi and C.Michael Hogan, Harbor Seal Study for Strawberry Spit, Marin County, California, Earth Metrics file reference 10323, BCDC and County of Marin, January 23, 1989 The species has been re-appearing in harvestable numbers in a number of North American fisheries including San Francisco Bay, Richardson Bay, Tomales Bay, Sitka Sound, Half Moon Bay and Humboldt Bay. In other areas, such as Auke Bay, which, in the late 1970s was the largest harvestable stock of herring in Alaska, the species remains severely depleted.O'Clair, Rita M. and O'Clair, Charles E., \\"Pacific herring,\\" Southeast Alaska's Rocky Shores: Animals. pg. 343-346. Plant Press: Auke Bay, Alaska (1998). Pacific herring are currently harvested commercially for bait and for roe. Past commercial uses included fish oil and fish meal. Conservation On April 2, 2007, the Juneau group of the Sierra Club submitted a petition to list Pacific herring in the Lynn Canal, Alaska, area as a threatened or endangered distinct population segment under the criteria of the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). On April 11, 2008, that petition was denied because the Lynn Canal population was not found to qualify as a distinct population segment. However, the National Marine Fisheries Service did announce would be initiating a status review for a wider Southeast Alaska distinct population segment of Pacific herring that includes the Lynn Canal population.Announcement of initiation of status review for Southeast Alaska Pacific herring The Southeast Alaska DPS of Pacific herring extends from Dixon Entrance northward to Cape Fairweather and Icy Point and includes all Pacific herring stocks in Southeast Alaska. On February 5, 2018, researchers at Western Washington University began researching causes for the decline in Pacific herring populations in the Puget Sound; a prominent speculated reason is the loss of eelgrass, an important spawning substrate for the herring.

G. De Sylva. First published in 1921, it is one of many popular songs whose lyrics use a \\"Bluebird of happiness\\" as a symbol of cheer. (\\"So keep on looking for a bluebird, and listening for his song.\\") In 2014, the song was later remastered by Pierre Karana, he is also attributed to remixing the lyrics. The song was introduced in the 1921 Broadway musical Bombo, where it was performed by Al Jolson. It became a well-known Jolson standard: the first of his several recordings of the song was on Columbia Records in October 1921. It has also been recorded by many other artists. Spike Jones and Doodles Weaver produced a parody that began with the lyrics: \\"When April showers, she never closes the curtain...\\" The British comedians Morecambe and Wise performed a skit featuring the song, which involved a light sprinkling of water drizzling on straight man Ernie Wise whenever he sang it, but a bucket of water being thrown over Eric Morecambe whenever he did the same.

It is also referred to as Hollies '65 to differentiate it from the similarly titled 1974 album. It went to No. 8 in the UK album charts. Originally available in mono only, it was reissued in stereo under the title Reflection in 1969. In 1997, British EMI put both mono and stereo versions of this album onto a single CD. Of the twelve tracks on this album, only \\"So Lonely\\" was issued on 45 in Great Britain; even then, it was the B-side to the 1965 hit \\"Look Through Any Window\\", a song recorded concurrent with the rest of this album. On the original album, only five of the twelve songs are band originals, attributed at the time to the pseudonym \\"L. Ransford\\" but actually written by Allan Clarke, Tony Hicks and Graham Nash. The rest were covers. In Scandinavia \\"Very Last Day\\" and \\"Too Many People\\" were issued on 45, with the former becoming a major hit in Sweden. The song \\"Put Yourself in My Place\\" (written by Clarke, Hicks and Nash) was also recorded by Episode Six and became their 1966 debut single. Track listing *Note: All songs written by the bandmembers were attributed to the pseudonym \\"L. Ransford\\". Hear! Here! (US version) More than a year after the release of the Hollies' US debut album, Here I Go Again, the success of \\"Look Through Any Window\\" (The Hollies' first Top 40 hit in the US) inspired Imperial Records, the Hollies' US label, to finally release another Hollies LP. In November 1965, Imperial released Hollies, with a slightly different track listing, as Hear! Here! in the US Imperial removed \\"Fortune Teller\\" and \\"Mickey's Monkey\\" from Hollies and added the singles \\"I'm Alive\\" and \\"Look Through Any Window\\". The track listing was then re-arranged so that the singles started each side. Although the album is clearly a US repackaging of the Hollies album, the cover uses the photo from the UK In The Hollies Style LP, which was never released in the USA. \\"Mickey's Monkey\\" later appeared in 1966 on the forthcoming \\"Bus Stop\\" album, but \\"Fortune Teller\\" was never issued in the US until the 1990s. In 2010, the mono version of this LP was reissued on 180 gram vinyl in the USA by Sundazed Records. =Track listing= Love N' Flowers (Canadian version) In 1967, The Hollies transferred the US and Canadian rights to all new material to Epic Records. Unlike Imperial Records in the US, Capitol Canada had opted not to issue a version of Hollies when it was released in 1965, choosing instead to release an edited version of the almost year-old album In The Hollies Style. However, even though all of the Hollies' master rights were owned by Capitol Records' parent company, EMI, Capitol Canada decided to counterprogram against The Hollies' first Epic release, Evolution. In November 1967, one month after the release of Evolution, Capitol Canada repackaged Hollies with a \\"flower child\\" cover (a later picture of The Hollies standing amidst tree branches under a title bar with flowered wallpaper, as shown) and issued it under the name Love N' Flowers. Capitol Canada had previously released two tracks from Hollies (\\"Very Last Day\\" and \\"Too Many People\\") on the Canadian version of Bus Stop, and a third track (\\"Mickey's Monkey\\") had been included on In The Hollies Style, leaving nine tracks from the album unissued in Canada. Capitol Canada added one of the tracks that it did not use from the UK version of In The Hollies Style (\\"I Thought of You Last Night\\") to make up the ten songs included on Love N' Flowers.

Over 300 artists from various disciplines use the space to develop and present new work. Fylkingen is run by its members and an active board and production group. It also produce and distribute recorded material through its own label Fylkingen Records since 1966. History The organization was established in 1933 in Stockholm, Sweden, then focusing on contemporary composers and a traditional repertoire. Over the years, the organization branched out into new forms. The first concert of electroacoustic music in Sweden was arranged by Fylkingen in 1952, together with the Swedish Radio. Since the 1960s Fylkingen represents a wide field of artistic practices. Fylkingen was founded in 1933 as a Chamber Music Society of musicians and composers in order to highlight the new music of contemporary composers in combination with a traditional repertoire. Composer Ingemar Liljefors served as the organization's first Chairman from 1933-1946. The interest in new music eventually led to that Fylkingen in cooperation with the Swedish Radio presented the first concert of electroacoustic music in Sweden in 1952 and in 1963 Fylkingen arranged the very first concerts of computer music, or data machine music as it was then called. Fylkingens concerts of electronic music attracted the attention of composers worldwide for the high sound quality and unconventional presentation format. Promenade Concerts with electronic music, music simultaneously in several rooms with different acoustic conditions and landscape music in Stockholm parks heard the news. In the 1960s the association radicalized more and more art forms took place at Fylkingen; performance art, dance, choreography, happenings and text-sound compositions. At the time, many of Fylkingens arrangement took place at Moderna Museet, with a detour to other premises in Stockholm and around Scandinavia. The programs from the 1960s and 1970s are filled with performances by and with the international avant-garde: John Cage, David Tudor; Iannis Xenakis, Pierre Boulez, Morton Subotnick, Ravi Shankar, Terry Riley, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Nam June Paik, Henri Chopin, and La Monte Young, side by side with major Swedish composers such as √Öke Hodell, Lars-Gunnar Bodin, √ñyvind Fahlstr√∂m, Sten Hanson, Folke Rabe and Catherine Christer Hennix and performing artists Margaretha √Ösberg, Yvonne Rainer, Merce Cunningham, Antonin Artaud, Carolee Schneeman. Later, visiting artists have been, for example; Brian Eno, Kaffe Matthews, Genesis P-Orridge, Her Noise, Andre Stitt, Carsten Nicolai, Damo Suzuki, Tara Transistory, Gudrun Gut and many many more. 1971 Fylkingen opened their first own stage on √ñstg√∂tagatan in Stockholm. 1986 Fylkingen moved to its current premises in the Munich Brewery, next door to the EMS Electronic Music Studio Elektroakustisk Musik i Sverige (the society for electroacoustic music in Sweden). EMS is since its start in 1964 the center of the Swedish electroacoustic music and sound art. Fylkingen was in the 1960s the driving force behind the founding of EMS and since then the organizations has continued its tightly linked collaboration. In connection with the move in 1986 to M√ºnchenbryggeriet the association became bigger, improvisational music dominated. In the 1980s many choreographers were based at Fylkingen; Efva Lilja, Per Jonsson, Susanne Valentin, Irene Hultman, Bj√∂rn Elisson, Anne K√ºlper, Margaretha √Ösberg and Susanne Jaresand (then H√•kansson) to name a few. The contemporary dance substantial development over the past decades could happened in Sweden thanks to Fylkingens open space and room. Many of the choreographers who \\"started\\" at Fylkingen later moved to other rooms. Modern Dance Theatre established its guest stage on Skeppsholmen, the House of Dance and the Cultural House was focused on dance, for example. Choreographers and dancers have been active at Fylkingen during different periods of time and today is yet another new generation of choreographers active in the association, along with an older generation. With a newly built dance floor, renovated in autumn 2015, the physical conditions for dance are efficient to have a place in Fylkingens rooms. Today Fylkingen presents over a hundred events a year and continues to play a significant role in contemporary music and art by being a stage, a platform and a place that provides space for the artistic freedom that experimental and radical artistic work need. Fylkingen is unique by being the world's oldest artist-run scene of its kind. Fylkingen Records Fylkingen Records, also called Fyrec, has since 1966 produced a series of important records with emphasis on electro-acoustic music and new chamber music. Fylkingen Records also has a record store at Fylkingen. The shop sell discs from Fylkingen Records catalog, as well as many odd, exclusive editions and rarities from a variety of other record labels specializing in experimental music in various forms. Fyrecs aims to present the disc editions that take advantage on Fylkingens rich heritage of electronic and experimental art music, and highlights the most interesting composers and sound artists from a conscious gender and norm-critical perspective. Books and archives In connection with Fylkingen 60th anniversary in 1993 Fylkingen published a book about the history of the society: \\"Sixty years of radical and experimental art 1933‚Äì1993\\". The book contains, in addition to a detailed list of events, including articles, essays and photographs that reflect on the society's long history. In autumn 2013, Fylkingen published a new book in connection with the 80th anniversary, \\"FYLKINGEN 80!\\". The new book picks up where the former left off and continues to portray the activities until 2012. Fylkingen also has an extensive archive of audio and video recordings, posters, articles, publications and programs, since the fall of 2012 kept in the Music and Arts Library in Stockholm. Fylkingen journals Since the 1960s, Fylkingen has intermittently published periodicals (Fylkingen Bulletin/Fylkingen International Bulletin 1966-1968 and 1983, Hz-Fylkingens Bulletin 1992-93, and Hz Journal online 2000‚Äìpresent). Resting on \\"the foundation for Fylkingen to engage in 'Art & Technology' problematics‚Äù laid in 1965 by Knut Wiggen (then the Chairperson), the journals often explore cutting-edge up-to-date issues of contemporary art and music in conjunction with technology and science. The artists and researchers whose articles are presented in these journals include John Cage (1966), Pierre Schaeffer (1967, 1968), Alvin Lucier (1967), Nam June Paik (1967), John R.

Like its subsidiary institution, the NAWCC Library & Research Center, the National Watch and Clock Museum is operated by the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors (NAWCC), a non-profit organization with about 21,000 members and an educational mission. History Clock tower The National Watch and Clock Museum was founded in 1977 by the NAWCC and over time has put together a major collection of horological artifacts, mainly clocks and watches, but also related tools, machinery and ephemera, and has become an important institution in its field. Most of the greatest and most important clocks and watches ever made have been preserved and exhibited ‚Äî for decades if not centuries ‚Äî as decorative art in such major museums around the world as the British Museum in London or the Metropolitan Museum in New York, or form a small department in the globally important museums of technology and science such as the Smithsonian Institution, the Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers or the Deutsches Museum. There are only few museums like NWCM, dedicated principally to the history of timekeeping, and the majority of them - located in former centers of horological production - have primarily a local or regional focus. Since the former \\"Time Museum\\" in Rockford, IL closed in the 1990s, the NWCM is often described as the broadest specialist horology museum in the country. (The only comparable museum in the United States is the American Clock & Watch Museum in Bristol, Conn., but that one is more focused on American-made timekeepers). The museum, located near the Susquehanna River in Lancaster County's Pennsylvania Dutch tourist area, serves both a general public (including youth), as well as a specialized audience of horological aficionados (including NAWCC members), which appreciate its study collection and some of the more specialized temporary exhibits. Exhibits Longcase clocks A rare Austrian chariot clock. The museum attempts to show the complete history of timekeepers from the first non-mechanical devices (sun-dials, hour- glasses, fire-clocks) to the atomic clock and mass-produced wristwatches of the present. The museum's collections include over 12,000 clocks and watches, with about 3,000 on display. The monumental Engel Clock There is a \\"Learning Center\\" introducing some of the basic technologies of the mechanical timekeeper, such as the pendulum, and a large and varied exhibit on many types of clock escapement. There is an excellent sample of American-made tall case clocks (popularly known as \\"grandfather clocks\\"), a comprehensive exhibit on American watches, and a small but excellent area dedicated to automatic machinery used in watch manufacturing. Other highlights include an exhibit of the pioneering automated machinery developed by the American Waltham Watch Company, allowing for the first time to mass-produce watches using interchangeable parts, a large selection of American pocket watches (including Railroad watches), and the \\"Engel Clock\\", a complicated \\"monument\\" clock built by Stephen Decatur Engel of Hazleton, Pennsylvania. This clock took Engel about 20 years to complete, and it was shown for many years all around the United States starting in about 1877. The Engel clock disappeared in the early 1950s, and was found in a barn in New York State in 1983. The Engel clock was purchased and fully restored by the NAWCC in 1989 and is on display at the museum. The NWCM has an ongoing schedule of temporary exhibits ‚Äî usually two of them at a time, one devoted to a general timekeeping-related theme of interest to the public, and the other a more specialized show appealing primarily to horological collectors.

Rudolf Spanner (born 17 April 1895 in Metternich bei Koblenz; died 31 August 1960) was Director of the Danzig Anatomical Institute during World War II. Allegations of human soap During the Nuremberg Trials, Sigmund Mazur, a laboratory assistant at the Danzig Anatomical Institute, testified that soap had been made from corpse fat at the institute, and claimed that 70 to 80 kg (155‚Äì175 lb) of fat collected from 40 bodies could produce more than of soap, and that the finished soap was retained by Professor Rudolf Spanner. Two British POWs who had to assist with auxiliary task at the Institute provided witness- accounts.http://holocaust.skeptik.net/documents/soap.htm In his book Russia at War 1941 to 1945, Alexander Werth claims that while visiting /Danzig in 1945 shortly after its conquest by the Red Army, he saw an experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human corpses. According to Werth it had been run by \\"a German professor called Spanner\\" and \\"was a nightmarish sight, with its vats full of human heads and torsos pickled in some liquid, and its pails full of a flakey substance‚Äîhuman soap\\". Polish historian Joachim Neander states that the rumors of Nazi soap production of murdered Jews in concentration camps, long-since thoroughly debunked, still hold wide belief, which is exploited by holocaust deniers. He however goes on to say that even scholars that reject the aforementioned claims of soap production are still convinced that small-scale, \\"experimental\\" soap production was done in by the Germans in Danzig, and that this claim is also repeated as a firm fact in several remembrance contexts. He, and the other Polish historians such as Monika Tomkiewicz and Piotr Semk√≥w, have thoroughly investigated the claims of human soap production in the Danzig Anatomical Institute by Spanner and all concludes these soap-making claims are also a myth, particularly cemented into Polish consciousness by Zofia Na≈Çkowska's 1946 book Medaliony, which was mandatory reading in Poland until 1990, widely distributed in the Eastern Bloc, and is still popular today. They all alleged that such secondary sources have played a far larger role of spreading information about the claim than scholarly research. It is pointed out the soap-making recipe given by Manzur at the Nuremberg trials to be contradictory and unrealistic, with a testimony from 12 May 1945 claiming 75kg fat produced 8kg soap from the first boiling, a testimony from 28 May 1945 claiming 70-80kg fat from 40 bodies produced 25kg soap from both boilings, and a testimony from 7 June 1945 claiming 40 bodies produced 40kg soap from both boilings. These inconsistencies were even pointed out before the Chief Commission. The witness testimonies from the two British POW's were also noted in a 1990's report from the newly established Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C. to be \\"contradictory and inconclusive\\", and they hold a cautious stance of the Danzig Soap issue. Tomkiewicz and Semk√≥w state that recent surface analysis by the Department of Forensic Medicine at the Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk of soap tested negative for human DNA. They also document how a Polish 2006 delegation by from the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology to the Hague which sampled the soap-material presented in the Nuremberg trials did show to possibly contain human fat\\"Human Fat Was Used to Produce Soap in Gdansk during the War\\" , Auschwitz‚ÄìBirkenau Memorial and Museum website, 13 October 2006. Accessed July 12, 2011., but that the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) Gd√°nsk branch closed the investigation citing lack of evidence of crimes committed. The IPN did however maintain that human fat has been used, based on 1945 testimonies and the presence of kaolin in the samples, the abrasive qualities of which indicated possible use as a cleaning soap. Tomkiewicz and Semk√≥w's research, however, concluded that Spanner, a well-respected physician who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1939, would not have been \\"experimenting\\" with soap production (which was widely understood and not something which needed experimentation) instead of teaching his students, and that the soapy grease (claimed to be \\"unfinished soap\\"), a by-product stemming from bone maceration in the creation of anatomical models for the institute, was injected into the models flexible joints. They further noted that Spanner had previously done research on kaolin injections into cadavers, and stated that the kaolin could have come from the cadaver itself, rather than as a later additive. Both Neander, and Tomkiewicz and Semk√≥w, state that the origin of this myth come from the findings of bodies and maceration processes in a small brick building on the premise the anatomical institute which was used by the Soviets and newly established Polish Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation as \\"proof\\" of human soap production in concentration camps, which had been presented as fact and become a stock phrase in Soviet propaganda, but of which no evidence could be found in the liberated camps. The \\"human soap\\" found in Danzig was conflated with the separate rumors regarding the concentration camps and presented together during the Nuremberg trials. Neander concludes that no research, experiments or production on soap- making were conducted in Danzig, that Manzur never made soap according to his \\"recipe\\", that the corpses delivered to be boiled to create anatomical models were all Germans, and which had not been killed in order to \\"harvest\\" their bodies. His research did however conclude that the grease was used for simple cleaning purposes towards the end of the war and that Spanner bore responsibility for this, whether he was aware of it or not, as head of the institute, but that it amounted to a misdemeanor in the handling of dead bodies, as opposed to any criminal behavior, let alone a crime against humanity or involvement in any genocidal activities, something which is today officially acknowledged in Poland. Tomkiewicz and Semk√≥w write that when Zofia Na≈Çkowska, Vice-Chairperson of the Chief Commission, was already writing her short-story \\"Professor Spanner\\" (which would be published in Medaliony), Spanner was already back to working as a medical doctor, under his own name, in Schleswig-Holstein in September 1945, unaware that he was being linked with any possible crimes. He was arrested in May 1947, but released three days later. He was later arrested again, but once again released after explaining the maceration and injection process. He was officially exonerated in 1948 and resumed his academic career.

After the war, he was tried, convicted for treason, and sentenced to death in a public court-martial carried out by the British Indian Army. The sentence was commuted by the Commander-in-chief of the Indian Army following unrest and protests in India. Early life As he states in his autobiography, Khan was born on the 24th January 1914 into a Punjabi Muslim family of the Rajput- Janjua clan to Tikka Khan, who retired as a Captain of the British Indian Army, in Matore, a village now in the Rawalpindi District of Pakistan.Shah Nawaz Khan, The I.

He got his military education at the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College (now the Rashtriya Indian Military College).Who's who, Issue 5, The Second World War and the Indian National Army Khan, who rose to the rank of Captain in the Indian Army, was captured by the Japanese after the fall of Singapore in 1942. A prisoner of war in Singapore, he was profoundly influenced by Subhas Chandra Bose's speeches asking POWs to join the Indian National Army and to fight for a free India.The INA Trial and The Raj (2003), Harkirat Singh, Atlantic Publishers & Dist, , p. 26 He later stated: Impressed by Bose‚Äôs patriotic speeches, Nawaz joined the INA in 1943. He was included in the Cabinet of the Arzi Hukumat-e- Azad Hind (INA) formed by Bose. Later, Bose decided to select a regiment consisting of the cream of the INA and send it to action to spearhead the advance into India. Khan led the army into North- Eastern India, seizing Kohima and Imphal which were held briefly by the INA under the authority of the Japanese. In December 1944, Shah Nawaz Khan was appointed Commander of the 1st Division at Mandalay. thumb Indian National Army trials Khan was tried, along with General Prem Sahgal and Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon, for \\"waging war against the King Emperor\\" in a public court martial at the Red Fort in Delhi. They were defended by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Asaf Ali, Bhulabhai Desai, Kailash Nath Katju and others based on the defence that they should be treated as prisoners of war as they were not paid mercenaries but bona fide soldiers of a legal government, the Provisional Government of Free India, or the Azad Hind Government, \\"however misinformed or otherwise they had been in their notion of patriotic duty towards their country\\" and as such they recognized the free Indian state as their sovereign and not the British sovereign.A Hundred Horizons, Sugata Bose, 2006 USA, p136 During the trial, Khan cited the differential treatment meted out to Indian versus British soldiers in the Indian Army. In his testimony, Khan testified that no Indian officers were given the command of a division and only one was allowed to command a Brigade. Khan was given the death sentence by the court but that sentence was reduced to cashiering by the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. After the Indian National Army (INA) of Subhas Chandra Bose surrendered to British forces, officers and soldiers of the INA were arrested. Major General Shah Nawaz Khan, Col Prem Kumar, and Col. Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon were tried in court. Upon the directive of Allama Mashriqi, the Khaksars made great efforts for their release and their efforts did not go in vain. During a visit to the Khaksar Tehrik headquarters, Major General Shah Nawaz thanked Allama Mashriqi for obtaining their release. The General also thanked the Khaksars and stated, ‚ÄúWe are highly grateful to the Khaksar Tehrik for their efforts in obtaining our release.‚Äù (‚ÄúAl-Islah‚Äù dated January 11, 1946). On this occasion, Major General Shah Nawaz Khan and Col.

Having successfully contested the first Lok Sabha in 1952 from Meerut, Khan had an illustrious parliamentary career becoming: * The Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Minister of Railway and Transport for 11 years (1952‚Äì1956) & (1957‚Äì1964 (second term)) * Minister of Food & Agriculture (1965) * Minister of Labour, Employment & Rehabilitation (1966) * Minister of Steel & Mines and Minister of Petroleum & Chemical Industries (1971‚Äì1973) * Minister of Agriculture & Irrigation(1974‚Äì1975) * Minister of Agriculture & Irrigation (1975‚Äì1977) * Chairman of National Seeds Corporation Ltd. * Chairman, Food Corporation of India. He was elected four times to the Lok Sabha from Meerut constituency in 1951, 1957, 1962 and 1971. He lost in the 1967 and 1977 Lok Sabha election from Meerut. During the 1965 war, his son Mahmud was a Pakistan Army Officer and the opposition demanded he be removed from the government. But Lal Bahadur Shastri, as Prime Minister, refused to accede and reminded them of his selfless service to India as an Officer of the INA. Khan's political views were leftist, supporting land reforms and public distribution. But his support for permanent separate personal laws for religious communities led to his defeat in the 1967 elections against Jan Sangh. In 1969, the Indian National Congress split, leading him to side with Indira Gandhi. The 1971 \\"Gareebi Hatao\\" campaign brought him again as MP from Meerut. In 1977, the Janata Party led to his defeat and ended his career in Parliament. He remained as head of Congress Sewa Dal till his death in 1983. Shahnawaz Committee In 1956, the government constituted a committee to look into the circumstances around Subhas Chandra Bose's death with Khan as the head. The committee included Bose's elder brother Suresh Chandra Bose. The Committee began its work in April 1956 and concluded four months later when two out of the three members (excluding Suresh Chandra Bose) concluded that Bose had died in the airplane crash at Taihoku (Japanese for Taipei) in Formosa (now Taiwan), on 18 August 1945. They stated that his ashes were kept in Japan's Renkoji Temple and should be reinstated to India. In popular culture In the 2005 movie Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero, Khan was portrayed by actor Sonu Sood. In the 2017 film Raagdesh on the Red Fort Trials, he is portrayed by actor Kunal Kapoor.

Available at: https://web.archive.org/web/20070403185442/http://www.alvas.com/Zunigar/website/rick_zunigar.htm The organ trio format was characterized by long improvised solos and an exploration of different musical \\"moods\\". In organ trios, the Hammond organist plays several roles, including playing the basslines (either on the bass pedalboard or on the lower manual of the organ), playing chords (\\"comping\\"), and playing lead melodic lines and solos. In organ trios with a guitarist, the guitarist usually 'fills in' the musical parts that the organist is not performing. For example, if the organist is soloing and playing a bassline, the guitarist may play chords. Organ trios of the 1950s and 1960s often played soul jazz, a groove-infused style that incorporated blues, gospel and rhythm and blues. 1970s-era organ trios such as Tony Williams' band Lifetime played jazz-rock fusion. In the 1990s and 2000s, organ trios such as Medeski, Martin and Wood and Soulive became involved in the burgeoning jamband scene. History =Pre-1950s= While jazz musicians such as Fats Waller and Count Basie explored the use of organ in jazz ensembles in the 1920s and 1930s, it was not until the late 1940s that Hammond players such as Wild Bill Davis pioneered the organ trio format. Musicians such as Davis and the Milt Herth Trio realized that the amplified Hammond B3 organ \\"put the power of a full- sized big band in the hands of one musician\\", with the rotating Leslie speaker-equipped amplified cabinet adding a room-filling, \\"king-sized sound.\\" Tom Vickers. Organ Grinder Swing. Available at: https://archive.is/20130119003211/http://www.catalog-of- cool.com/organ.htmllang_fr =1950s‚Äì1960s= In the 1950s and 1960s, the organ trio became a common musical ensemble in bars and taverns in the US, especially in downtown areas of major cities. Organ trios used the powerful amplified sound of the Hammond organ, and its ability to fill multiple musical roles (basslines, chords, and lead lines), to fill a bar or club with a volume of sound that would have previously required a much larger ensemble. While bar owners liked this money-saving aspect of the organ trio, the format also had a number of musical advantages. The organ trio was a more intimate, smaller ensemble, which facilitated communication between musicians, and allowed more freedom for spontaneous changes of mood or tempo, and for \\"stretching out\\" on extended solos. According to Tom Vicker, the \\"most famous of the early [organ trio] grinders was Philadelphia's Bill Doggett, who recorded instrumentals for King Records in the early Fifties\\". The next organists to come along were Hank Marr, Dave \\"Baby\\" Cortez, Jimmy McGriff, and then the \\"bossest organ swinger yet, Jimmy Smith\\". After Smith's death in 2005, Variety magazine writer Phil Gallo eulogized Smith as a man who \\"[s]ingle-handedly reinvented the Hammond B3 organ for jazz and created the model for the organ trio\\".Available at: https://web.archive.org/web/20100531000724/http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/BraveNewsWorld/MUSIC/BNWSmith.html During the 1960s, jazz guitarists such as Howard Roberts, Grant Green, Kenny Burrell, George Benson, and Wes Montgomery often performed in organ trios, and organ trio recordings often made the R&B; and pop charts. Hammond organ players such as \\"Brother\\" Jack McDuff, Johnny \\"Hammond\\" Smith and Richard \\"Groove\\" Holmes often performed and recorded in organ trios. The \\"body of work by the leaders in the organ trio idiom in its heyday has been well documented, owing to the fact during that era, based on record sales, the organ groups -- most significantly those led by Jimmy Smith -- represented perhaps the most popular genre of jazz\\". Guitarist Grant Green performed a blend of jazz, funk, and boogaloo, collaborating frequently with organists \\"Big\\" John Patton, Jack McDuff, and Neal Creque and with drummer Idris Muhammad. In the late 1960s, as jazz musicians began to explore the new genre of jazz-rock fusion, organ trios led by organists such as Larry Young \\"ventured into more remote territory, expanding the harmonic palette of the organ trio form\\". Young pioneered a new approach to playing the Hammond B3. In contrast to Jimmy Smith's blues- influenced soul-jazz style, in which songs were structured over chord progressions, Young favored a modal approach to playing, in which songs were based on musical modes rather than chord progressions. =1970s‚Äì1980s= Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Maple Leaf Gardens, Toronto 1978 In the 1970s, the 1960s-style organ trios based around a Hammond organ were eclipsed by the new trend of jazz-rock fusion, and small ensembles increasingly used electronic keyboards such as Moog synthesizer in place of the Hammond organ. Synthesizers allowed musicians to make new electronic sounds that were not possible on the electromechanical Hammond organs. Emerson, Lake & Palmer was one organ trio that successfully branched between the changing times between their debut performances in 1970 towards the end of the decade, with Keith Emerson on the Hammond B3 organ, Greg Lake on either the guitar or bass guitar, and Carl Palmer on drums; Emerson was one of the earliest in moving into synthetic sound. Veteran Hammond players such as Emerson and Charles Earland began using synthesizers to \\"update\\" their sound to the pop-disco styles of the late 1970s. There were a small number of well-known organ trios during the 1970s. John Abercrombie had a futuristic-sounding organ trio with Jan Hammer on Hammond and Moog bass, and Jack DeJohnette on drums. Tony Williams' fusion band Lifetime, which lasted from 1969 to 1975, was an organ trio with John McLaughlin on guitar and Larry Young on organ. Lifetime was a pioneering band of the fusion movement, combining rock, R&B;, and jazz. =1990s= Traditional groups Jazz organist Joey Defrancesco, pictured here in 2002, has recorded albums that recapture the \\"old school\\" organ trio sound of the 1960s. In the 1990s and 2000s, there was a revival of organ trios in the Jazz, Blues, Soul and R&B; genres. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, before his death in 2005, Jimmy Smith had a comeback, recording albums and playing in clubs. Some groups, such as the organ trio led by the Jimmy Smith-mentored Hammond player Joey DeFrancesco, aimed to recapture the traditional sounds and blues-influenced jazz feel of the 1960s organ trios of Smith, McDuff and Don Patterson. The Deep Blue Organ Trio, a Chicago guitar- organ trio, recorded two albums for Delmark Records and two with Origin Records, and toured with Steely Dan several times. In the tradition of Wes Montgomery and George Benson their sound was infused with more African, blues and post-Bop rhythms with focus on the play of both organist Chris Foreman and guitarist Bobby Broom. The Danish organ trio, Ibrahim Electric, also explored different kinds of developments from jazz, such as afro-beat, and boogaloo with a strong blues traditional influence, but with the main focus on the Hammond B-3 played by Jeppe Tuxen. In 2007 Steve Howe created the Steve Howe Trio, inspired mainly by Kenny Burrell's work. Other variations Organ trios such as Medeski, Martin & Wood (MMW), Niacin, Soulive and Mike Mangan's Big Organ Trio mix jazz with a range of different styles such as 1970s soul jazz, jazz fusion, and jam band-style improvisation. MMW used a variation of the organ trio format, since the band includes Hammond organ, upright bass and drums. The New York organ trio Darediablo blends funk, progressive rock, fusion, and hard rock into a heavy, riff-laden sound. More rarely, some blues bands use the organ trio format, such as the UK band led by guitarist Matt Schofield (the Matt Schofield Trio's organist is Jonny Henderson). The Medeski, Martin and Wood organ trio demonstrates that an organ trio can come in different varieties; in place of a sax or electric guitarist, this band has an upright bass player as the third member. An unusual example of an organ trio-influenced performer is Charlie Hunter, who used a customized 8-string guitar to emulate the role and sound of a Hammond Organ. He performed bass lines on his guitar's three electric bass-range strings, while playing chords and melody lines on the higher strings. In the mid-2000s, saxophonist/bass- clarinettist/flutist James Carter has performed and recorded modern and more traditional jazz, with his James Carter Organ Trio, with Gerard Gibbs on Hammond B-3 and Leonard King on drums. These recordings include Live at Baker's Keyboard Lounge in 2001 (released 2004), and Out of Nowhere, in 2004, and drummer Leonard King's Extending the Language in 2005. =2000s and 2010s= Jazz groups After the Deep Blue Organ Trio disbanded in 2013,'MY SHINING HOUR' BOBBY BROOM'S 11TH ALBUM, TO RELEASE IN AUGUST - BobbyBroom.com Chicago guitarist Bobby Broom, who had been a pivotal player in the group, launched his own organ trio The Bobby Broom Organi-Sation featuring new young Chicago musicians, Ben Paterson on the Hammond B-3 and alternating drummers Makaya McCraven and Kobie Watkins. The group toured with Steely Dan on their Jamalot Ever After North American tour, and began working in the Chicago area and work on their first album.Bobby Broom Organi-Sation to Open for Steely Dan Jamalot Ever After Tour 2014 - BobbyBroom.com Other variations The English progressive rock band Van der Graaf Generator effectively operated as an \\"organ trio\\" beginning in 2006, when saxophonist/flautist David Jackson left, leaving the core of the early-1970s lineup (Peter Hammill (vocals/guitar/piano), Hugh Banton (organ/keyboards) and Guy Evans (drums/percussion) to continue to the present day (as of 2012). Banton, a classically trained organist, has provided the bass from the organ (occasionally playing bass guitar in the studio) since Nic Potter left the band in 1970. Therefore, the Van der Graaf Generator lineup of 1970-71 (Hammill, Banton, Evans and Jackson) which recorded Pawn Hearts (1971), could also be viewed as an \\"organ-trio-plus-saxophone\\". Musical style, tradition and variants =As a musical style or tradition= While the term \\"organ trio\\" is typically a reference to a type of small ensemble, the term \\"organ trio\\" is also used to refer to the musical styles, genres, and tradition of the 1950s/1960s era of organ trio playing. Although the components of the \\"organ trio tradition\\" are a subject of debate, the 1950s/1960s organ trio style tends to have more blues influences than other small-group jazz from this era, and it often blurs the lines between blues, R&B;, and jazz. As well, organ trios tend to be focused on, or built around the sound of the organ. The organ trio style has also been associated with soul jazz, a development of hard bop which incorporated strong influences from blues, gospel and rhythm and blues. However, unlike hard bop, soul jazz generally emphasized repetitive grooves and melodic hooks, and its improvisations were often less complex than in other jazz styles. Music critics discussing 1990s and 2000s-era organ trios often refer to how a modern-day group is positioned vis-√†-vis the \\"organ trio tradition\\" of the 1950s and 1960s. For example, John Koenig's review of guitarist Rick Zunigar's organ trio recordings notes that Zunigar's \\"...conception of the organ trio gives us a present-day look at the genre, filtered through all of the tradition of the past, but also infused with other influences and trends that have their roots in the major jazz movements of the last 30 years.\\" Available at: https://web.archive.org/web/20070403185442/http://www.alvas.com/Zunigar/website/rick_zunigar.htm =Variant forms= More rarely, an organ trio might consist of a Hammond organist and two jazz guitarists, or a Hammond organist, a double bassist, and a drummer. For example, organist Shirley Scott had an organ trio that included a bass player and a drummer. In some cases, a fourth musician will be added to a traditional organ trio, such as a saxophone player or vocalist. In this case, the group may be billed as \\"saxophone player and organ trio\\" or \\"singer and organ trio.\\" For example, reviewer Dan McClenaghan, from All About Jazz, said that \\"...a fine organ trio [was] backing a talented saxophonist\\" in one of tenor saxophonist David Sills' recordings.Dan McClenaghan. David Sills, Eastern View. https://web.archive.org/web/20100103135213/http://www.origin- records.com/reviews/review.php?ReviewID=222 Accessed 30 May 2008. Describing these four-musician ensembles as a \\"trio plus one\\", instead of as a quartet, may appear to be a misnomer. However, this approach can be justified because there are different musical styles and traditions associated with different types of jazz ensembles. As such, if a concert is billed as a jazz quartet (e.g. a saxophone and a rhythm section), the audience has expectations about the repertoire and musical styles than if a concert is billed as an organ trio with a saxophone. There are specific musical styles, genres, and traditions that are associated with the 1950s/1960s era of organ trio playing (see section above). Other meanings =Baroque-era works for solo organ= J.S. Bach and other Baroque composers from the 17th century and early 18th century wrote many organ works called trio sonatas, often based on chorale prelude melodies. These organ trio sonata compositions are sometimes referred to as \\"organ trios.\\" Bach's organ trio sonatas are written for a single instrument‚Äîthe baroque pipe organ. They are nonetheless called trio sonatas because they are written in three independent melodic lines, or \\"voices\\". To help the audience hear the three different melodic lines, Bach indicated that the trio sonatas should be performed on two separate manuals (organ keyboards), with the bass pedalboard supplying the third, lower part. To further help the audience to hear the different upper melodic lines, organists typically use different registrations for each manual by selecting different organ stops.Ruth Elaine Dykstra.

Due to its relation to winter wheat, it is very difficult to control. Not only are the joints similar in shape and size to the seeds of winter wheat, making it difficult to remove through grain cleaning methods, the shared genetics mean that no registered herbicides are available to single out jointed goatgrass while leaving winter wheat unharmed. This poses problems for farmers who have to suffer through reduced yields and poorer quality winter wheat.Management effects on the incidence of jointed goatgrass inhibitory rhizobacteria  History and distribution  Jointed goatgrass is a winter annual grass seed native to Southern Europe and Russia,Factors affecting germination of jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica) seed It is considered a problem weed in United States, where it is now widely spread across western and central regions. It entered the US at several different times and at different locations, however the first was possibly in the late 19th century when Mennonite settlers from Russia brought Turkey winter wheat to Kansas. The first sample of jointed goatgrass was collected in Centerville, DE in 1870 and later samples collected in 1910 showed that jointed goatgrass had escaped from experimental plots on South Dakota State University campus at Brookings, SD. In 1999, it was reported that jointed goatgrass had infested an estimated 2 million hectares in the US alone, and that this was annually increasing at a rate of about 20 000 hectares. In 1986, jointed goatgrass had been reported as having infected less than 1% of winter wheat fields in seven counties in Nebraska, yet it was rated one of the ten most troublesome weeds, concerning 13% of respondents to a 1984 farmer survey. Human activities, wind, and machinery help to spread jointed goatgrass seeds once the joints disarticulate. However, due to the size of joints, wind dispersal is not as effective at spreading jointed goatgrass. Some of the human activities that helped spread jointed goatgrass include; planting contaminated wheat, allowing joints to blow from passing trucks hauling grain, transporting combines to different fields, or using straw spreaders on combines. Steven Miller argued that some states did not have laws that prevented contaminated winter wheat from being certified, which helped lead to it still being planted. Combines with straw spreaders are likely to spread jointed goatgrass joints farther than combines without these spreaders. Also, because the joints can float, runoff from fields can take them into rivers where they can aggregate and create an infestation in moist depressions, draws in fields, or along drainageways. It has been observed by growers and researchers that jointed goatgrass has a higher germination and emergence rate in compacted soils (such as in the wheel tracts of tractors) than in looser soils.  Biology  Jointed goatgrass and winter wheat are genetically linked through a D genome which allows them to live in cold, continental climates and means they are capable of cross-breeding. They are both C3 plants, have similar phenology and growth rates and even germinate at the same time. Jointed goatgrass has glabrous to scabrous glumes with upright culms and the ability to produce 50 erect flowering stalks for each isolated plant. Both wheat and jointed goatgrass have spikes that are sessile and alternately arranged spikelets on opposite sides of the rachis. Each spikelet holds one to two seeds, and in some cases three, that are reddish-brown in colour and reach maturity in mid-summer which is when the spikelets shatter. These seeds adhere to the lemma and palea of the glume, so that removing the seeds from the joints is difficult.  Agricultural issues  Jointed goatgrass can reduce the yield of winter wheat by 25 ‚Äì 50% which can cost US farmers up to $145 million. Another problem is that winter wheat provides an overwinter home for winter wheat attacking pests such as Russian wheat aphid, leaf spot, pink mold, foot rot, dwarf bunt, fron, root browning, damping off, and kernel bunt. When the spikes shatter, the disjointed spikelets are cylindrical in shape and are easily mistaken for small pieces of winter wheat straw. Since the spikelets are similar in shape and size to winter wheat seeds, it is difficult to separate them from the wheat using conventional methods. Better methods use length graders or weight tables, but these are slow and costly to operate. The Official United States Standards for Grain states that when the spikelets get mixed in with the winter wheat, the wheat is considered contaminated and the grade is reduced, resulting in a penalty. The more jointed goatgrass found in the wheat, the lower the grade and the larger the penalty. The lowest penalty is $0.02 per bushel while the highest is $0.15 per bushel. =Benefits= Jointed goatgrass does have some benefits in the sense that its germplasm can be used in winter wheat to improve its tolerance to environmental stresses, diseases and insects. Cattle in parts of the Central Great Plains are able to graze on it as well as winter wheat, and jointed goatgrass can even be ground into feed for other animals. =Solutions= Since jointed goatgrass and winter wheat are genetically related, there are no registered herbicides that can selectively kill off the jointed goatgrass without harming the winter wheat. However, Newhouse et al. looked at the development of an imidazolinone resistant strain of winter wheat which allows the use of imazamox to kill jointed goatgrass, but Seefeldt et al. mentioned the concerns about the possibility of resistant jointed goatgrass ‚Äì winter wheat hybrids.A Visual Guide to Help Producers Manage Jointed Goatgrass This has resulted in a demand for other methods for controlling jointed goatgrass. These include planting only certified winter wheat seed that is free of jointed goatgrass, covering trucks that are transporting contaminated winter wheat, cleaning combines before moving them to a new field, allowing combines to enter each field through one spot only so possible infestations can be localized, using combines that lack straw or chaff spreaders, mowing jointed goatgrass found along roadsides, fields or waste areas, as well as using cultural practices. These cultural practices include fallowing for one or more growth seasons, long-term crop rotations which would mean growing winter wheat only once every three to four years, and delaying seed planting so that seedbed preparations will destroy jointed goatgrass seedlings (although this may also reduce the yield of winter wheat). These practices are not completely effective since jointed goatgrass seeds are able to persist and can stay in dormancy for up to five years. The best solution is to use several cultural tactics throughout the life cycle of jointed goatgrass and at a minimum of three different decision times (during the interval between winter wheat crops, before planting winter wheat, after planting but before winter wheat jointing, and before harvesting). Other cultural practices include burning the residue after harvest and deep moldboard plowing, although Ball et al. point out that these methods can reduce air quality, increase soil erosion, decrease soil productivity and result in lost organic matter. Another option for the control of jointed goatgrass is to use deleterious rhizobacteria (DRB) which scientists have already proven can suppress other weeds. However, the success of DRB depends upon its ability to survive which is affected by environmental factors such as soil series, temperature, moisture, and sunlight exposure. The goal for DRB is for it to be a low-cost, effective method for the control of jointed goatgrass with minimum damage to the environment.

CV2 also publishes essays, interviews, articles and reviews regarding various poetic works. The magazine tries to stimulate discussion, encourages people to try out their writing skills in various contests (See Contests) and to enjoy poetry. Although the magazine is in English, CV2 also accepts French poetry. Published quarterly, Contemporary Verse 2 aims to: \\"Advance the understanding and appreciation of contemporary poetry through the publication of Contemporary Verse 2: The Canadian Journal of Poetry and Critical Writing and related activities.\\" (CV2) History Founded by Dorothy Livesay in 1975, CVII, as it was then called, continued where another poetry magazine (Contemporary Verse) had left off in the early 1950s. Livesay, who was also the editor at the time, found that there were not enough magazines that discussed Canadian poetry and for this reason designed the new CVII magazine to continue the discussion on modern poets and poetry. Later, the Roman numeral would be replaced by a 2 and the magazine would include an even wider range of discussion material. However, to this day the Contemporary Verse 2 magazine still discusses Canadian poetry. Website Readers can read excerpts from the current issue as well as back issues as far as Summer 2000 on the magazine's official website. Readers also have access to CV2's online subscription page, and can learn how to submit their work to the magazine. The magazine's contest site, the history of CV2, resources, the Lina Chartrand Award webpage, and a T-shirt store are the kinds of features readers can access on the CV2 website. There is also a special webpage dedicated to CV2's 35th anniversary celebration that happened in 2010. Features on the webpage include a contest, a word from CV2's writers on how the magazine has poetically changed them, how to purchase a 35th anniversary special edition of the magazine (double issue), and videos from CV2's Coast to Coast anniversary tour stop in Toronto. Website Coordinator for contemporaryverse2.ca is Melody Morrissette. Contests The magazine CV2 is dedicated to broadening the poetic community and publishing new poets. CV2 contests aim to get the readers of the magazine involved in the poetic community by submitting original work. The cost of an entry fee depends on the contest and may also include a one-year subscription to the magazine. The poems are then blindly read and judged by the staff at CV2. The winner(s) of a CV2 magazine contest can expect to have their submission published in an upcoming issue of CV2 magazine as well as a cash prize depending on the contest. Honourable mentions are also awarded and receive publications in upcoming issues. To find specifics on contest fees, prizes and more visit www.contemporaryverse2.ca CV2 offers an annual 2-day poem contest, where poets register online to receive ten words chosen by CV2 magazine. They then must compose one poem in a time frame of two days and contain the ten chosen words. First, second and third prizes are awarded as well as two honourable mentions.

In June 2018 the school moved to the new building at 111 Viewforth. The building was named the Building of the Year by Edinburgh Architectural Association, the building also won the RIAS Award 2018 and RIBA Award for Scotland. Its catchment area is in the south side of the city, and includes Bruntsfield, Buckstone, and South Morningside Primary Schools. In 2011 Boroughmuir's exam results were the fourth best state school results in Scotland. Boroughmuir High School was also awarded the high achievement of State School of the Year in 2012 and 2018 by the Sunday Times Newspaper. \\"Vassals of the Muir\\" is the official Boroughmuir school song.  Sport  Boroughmuir High School acquired the team Boroughmuir RFC in 1913, which is based at the Meggetland Sports Complex, as well as operating U15 (Under 15s) and U18 clubs as after-school activities.  Uniform  Pupils are required to wear the school tie: it has green and black stripes for students in S1 to S4 and is green with the crest in S5 and S6. A blazer was introduced in 2015 and made obligatory in 2016.  Houses  Each pupil is assigned to a house named after streets surrounding the school ‚Äì Leamington (yellow), Viewforth (green), Hartington (blue), Westhall (Red) and Montpelier. (Purple). The houses Bruntsfield and Montpelier were removed by David Dempster in 2013 and their remaining members were distributed among the remaining houses. Montpelier was recreated in 2018 to cope with an influx of new pupils, however this addition to the school was rather controversial and received a lot of backlash from pupils and staff. This resulted in pupils creating a petition to undo the addition of the house, this petition received 200+ signatures but ultimately failed after a meeting with head teacher David Dempster.

If only one sample required evaporation then a rotary evaporator is most often used. The most advanced modern centrifugal evaporators not only concentrate many samples at the same time, they eliminate solvent bumping and can handle solvents with boiling points of up to 220 ¬∞C. This is more than adequate for the modern high throughput laboratory. Design A centrifugal evaporator often comprises a vacuum pump connected to a centrifuge chamber in which the samples are placed. Many systems also have a cold trap or solvent condenser placed in line between the vacuum pump and the centrifuge chamber to collect the evaporated solvents. The most efficient systems also have a cold trap on the pump exhaust. There are many further developments available from manufacturers to speed up the process, and to provide protection for delicate samples. The system works by lowering the pressure in the centrifuge system - as the pressure drops so does the boiling point of the solvent(s) in the system. When the pressure is sufficiently low that the boiling points of the solvents are below the temperature of the sample holder, then they will boil. This enables solvent to be rapidly removed while the samples themselves are not heated to damaging temperatures. High performance systems can remove very high boiling solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) while keeping sample temperatures below 40 ¬∞C at all times. The centrifugal force generated by spinning the centrifuge rotor creates a pressure gradient within the solvent contained in the tubes or vials, this means that the samples boil from the top down, helping to prevent \\"bumping\\". The most advanced systems apply the vacuum slowly and run the rotor at speeds of 500 x gravity - this system is proven to prevent bumping and was patented by Genevac in the late 1990s. History Centrifugal evaporators were invented in 1960s by Savant Inc of USA, with their SpeedVac brand.

The Law Society of Scotland. Butterworths. Edinburgh. 1990. Volume 19. Page 9. was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. The act was passed on 23 March 1709, which was still considered part of the year 1708 in the British calendar of the time. It was passed to allow the naturalisation of French Protestants (Huguenots) who had fled to Britain since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. It was one of the British Subjects Acts 1708 to 1772.The Short Titles Act 1896, section 2(1) and Schedule 2 The Whig majority in Parliament passed the Act with the support of both Houses of Parliament, despite some opposition concerning a \\"conflux of aliens that would be invited over\\". A counter- argument is presented in the preamble of the Act, that \\"the increase of people is a means of advancing the wealth and strength of a nation\\". The effect of the Act was that all foreign Protestants could be naturalised, provided they swore allegiance to the government and received sacrament in any Protestant church. Following passage of the Act, up to 12,000 Palatines, Suabians, and other German Lutherans arrived in Britain between May and June 1709, owing to war in those places. Some German Catholics who arrived were sent back, and some immigrants were sent on to Ireland, New York and Carolina. The Act was largely repealed by the Tories in 1711 by the Naturalization Act 1711 (10 Anne c. 9).Index: N, O, Calendar of Treasury Books, Volume 27, 1713.

They are one of the first bands of the Brazilian thrash metal scene, along with bands like Sarc√≥fago and Sepultura. Their first release was issued in the seminal metal compilation called SP Metal on Baratos Afins label back in 1985. They changed the lineup a lot of times since the birth of the band, but three members, Marcello Pompeu (on vocals), Silvio Golfetti (on guitars) and Dick (on bass guitar) remained. The classic lineup of the band (1988‚Äì1992) was Marcello Pompeu (vocals), Silvio Golfetti (guitars), Marcelo Nicastro (guitars), Dick (bass) and Roberto Bet√£o Sileci (drums, replacing Zema who committed suicide in 1987). Early days Lacking the funds to record a studio album, their debut album, which was released in 1986 consisted of a collection of live recordings. A year later they released their first studio album called Sonho Man√≠aco. Around that time, Silvio Golfetti played guitars for the L.A. speed metal band Agent Steel for a short time in 1987, because he was a friend of John Cyriis, vocalist of Agent Steel and born in Brazil. He temporarily played guitars for Sepultura at the time when Andreas Kisser was unable to play due to an arm injury. In 1989, they changed their sound a little, going more in a direction of Bay Area thrash, and released the EP Pay For Your Lies, featuring a cover of Black Sabbath's \\"Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes\\". During that period Korzus became a major metal band in Brazil; they even struck a friendship with their idol, Formula One racer Ayrton Senna. 90's Two years later they came up with what most people call the best Korzus album to date, Mass Illusion. With production of Roger Moreira (vocalist/founder of the Brazilian rock band Ultraje A Rigor) the band gained more attention outside Brazil. A videoclip for the song \\"Agony\\" was made, and it received heavy air play on Furia Metal (a Brazilian version of MTV's Headbangers Ball). Drummer Beto Silesci and the guitarist Marcello Nicastro left the band, as each one pursued their own projects (Beto Silesci formed a band with his wife and tried the drums in the hardcore band Ratos de Por√£o; Marcello Nicastro became a well-known player of cavaquinho - a short four- string guitar used to play samba). After the departure of Beto Sileci and Marcello Nicastro, the band started to try an audience out of Brazil, due to the success of Sepultura. They recruited a guitarist called Soldado and a drummer called Fernando Schaefer and recorded in 1994 the album KZS. The band was musically fitting with the 90's NYHC sound of bands such as Madball and Sick of It All. On tour they played in the States with Biohazard and S.O.D. After two years, Soldado and Fernando Schaefer left the band (Fernando Schaefer became a drummer for several Brazilian bands like Treta, Pavilh√£o9, Rodox, Kiko Loureiro, and recently Endrah), and to replace them, they hired Heros Trench for the guitar post and Rodrigo Oliveira as the drummer. This lineup is still playing together and since they recorded in 1998 a live CD at the Brazilian edition of the Monsters of Rock festival and after some years without recording any album, they released the album Ties Of Blood in 2004. Present Korzus has a new formation, which includes Ant√¥nio Ara√∫jo as the new guitar player (replacing Silvio Golfetti). In 2010 the band released a new album, entitled Discipline Of Hate by German label AFM Records.

She is a lifelong resident of Taos Pueblo and descends from an unbroken line of Taos Pueblo natives. Her mother Tonita made traditional micaceous pottery for utilitarian use. She became interested in the micaceous pottery tradition in 1980 after a career of working as a pharmaceutical technician. She started making micaceous pottery at the age of 50 with the encouragement of a neighbor who gave her some clay. When she first started making pottery she made one-of-a-kind micaceous pots using different ancient designs and symbols. Eventually she began using more contemporary designs and symbols on her pots, making them out of both micaceous and white clay. She added an element of sculpture, producing many pieces with icons of corn, turtles, lizards, and kiva steps in relief. Her original corn design has become her most recognized symbol. She also often includes traditional ornamentation of rope fillets, tool-impressed rims and loop handles on her pots. Juanita has also produced sculptured objects including nativity scenes and storyteller dolls. As a self-taught potter, Juanita has come a long way in mastering the skills of making traditional micaceous pottery, which are truly beautiful works of art. She has attended numerous shows and exhibitions including the Santa Fe Indian Market, Denver Indian Market, the San Ildefonso and San Juan Pueblo Eight Northern Indian Markets among others. In 1988 she received first place in the San Ildefonso Eight Northern Indian Market. In 1994 she was designated a Master Potter by the School of American Research and was invited to attend the school‚Äôs Micaceous Pottery Artists Convocation. She was one of ten master micaceous potters to attend. In June 2004 she also taught a workshop at the Taos Art School on making traditional Taos Pueblo micaceous pottery.

They are sex toys created for massaging the clitoris, and are not penetrating sex toys, although the shape of some vibrators allows for penetration and the stimulation of inner erogenous zones for extra sexual pleasure. Regardless of the design, the main function of the clitoral vibrator is to vibrate at varying speeds and intensities. Vibrators are normally driven by batteries and some of them can be used underwater. Discretion is often a useful feature for a sex toy, so clitoral vibrators that look like ordinary objects at first glance are also available. Clitoral vibrators have been designed to resemble lipsticks, mobile telephones, sponges, and many other everyday items.  Types  A wand vibrator belt for hands-free use Most vibrators can be used for clitoral stimulation, but there are a few distinct types of vibrator available. Manual clitoral vibrators come in a wide variety of designs. Some wand vibrators (such as the Hitachi Magic Wand and the Doxy) are powered by a long cable to a wall socket, making them somewhat less convenient, and unsafe in a wet environment. However, they are generally powerful, offering more intense stimulation and better durability. There are also battery operated vibrators, as well as small ones that can be worn on a finger, and used for couples' play. Hands-free clitoral vibrators are generally smaller, less powerful devices held in place by straps or a harness. The most common ones are small, egg-shaped and attached to a multi-speed battery pack by a long cord. They may be remotely controlled. Butterfly strap- ons, vibrating panties, and cock rings are types of hands-free clitoral vibrators. Butterfly strap-ons are small vibrators with adjustable straps on the woman's waist and hips. Vibrating panties are panties with an extra pouch in front into which a small vibrator is placed. They are usually remote controlled, such as via an app on a mobile device, and can be worn outside of the home, such as in an office, car, etc. The remote control can be entrusted to the wearer's partner, but its range is limited, and the vibrator can also be remotely controlled via an app installed on both mobile devices. However, these vibrators are not silent, producing an audible humming sound when active. Cock rings feature a vibrating bullet, to stimulate the clitoris during intercourse, as well as an erection enhancer. Some hands-free vibrators are waterproof. There are also dual type of vibrators which provide stimulation to both the clitoris and G-spot. Some clitoral vibrators may be inserted into the vagina. These typically have a small arm near the base of the vibrator, providing simultaneous clitoral and vaginal stimulation. Variations include vibrators shaped like narrow bullets, animals, ergonomic forms, miniature rockets and large human tongues.

Born at Martley, Worcestershire, Stainforth began his artistic career as a traditional artist doing religious portraits and wood engravings in the vein of the Italian Old Masters. The quality of his work brought invitations to exhibit at the Royal Academy as well as at venues in Berlin, Germany; Brussels, Belgium; and Paris, France. At the beginning of the 20th century, he began working as a magazine illustrator but a visit to North Queensland, Australia in 1908 led to his settling there and developing his skills as a painter of animals and especially equine portraiture. Among his works, there is a portrait of the 1912 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner, Trafalgar. The publication \\"Racehorses In Australia with paintings by Martin Stainforth\\" is an important standard reference work in Australian Thoroughbred literature. First published in 1922 with many tipped in plates, a facsimile reprint was issued in 1983 but without any tipping in. Good copies of the original with dust jackets are hard to find. The book contained reproductions of paintings of many notable Thoroughbreds including Carbine, Comedy King, Kennaquhair, Poitrel and Eurythmic. Martin Stainforth lived in Sydney for close to twenty years but around 1928 he spent time in New Zealand before returning to his native England in 1930 where he was commissioned to do the portraits of a number of racehorses including Hyperion for Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby and other prominent owners such as King George V. Near the end of 1934, Stainforth moved to New York City where he would remain for nearly fifteen years, spending considerable time at the hotel Breslin. He was hired to paint many famous American horses, including future U.S. Hall of Fame horse, Johnstown and 1937 U.S. Triple Crown winner, War Admiral as well as early American champion Sir Archy and Man o' War. Martin Stainforth returned to England around 1949 where he died in 1957. Some of his works can be seen at the Australian Jockey Club at Randwick Racecourse near Sydney, New South Wales as well as at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. A watercolour of Carbine by the artist (who painted the great horse on a number of occasions) sold for A$25,000 at a Sotheby's auction in Sydney in late 2007.

Along with Juana Leno, they have been called \\"The Four Matriarchs\\" who \\"revived the ancient style of Acoma pottery.\\" The inspiration for many designs used on their pottery were found on old potsherds gathered to use for temper. Together they led the revival of ancient pottery forms including the Mimbres, Tularosa and other various cultures in the Anasazi region. This revival spread to other potters who also accepted the old styles, which led to new innovative designs and variations of style and form. In 1922, Marie won her first award at the Santa Fe Indian Market at the age of fifteen. She went on to receive numerous awards for her pottery from 1970-1982. In 1998 the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts recognized Marie with a ‚ÄúLifetime Achievement Award.‚Äù Marie became particularly well known for her fine-line black-on-white pottery and vases with the step design. Her pots were distinctive in their complex geometric designs as well as the combination of life forms and abstract symbols. Some of her favorite designs include: Mimbres animals, Tularosa swirls, Acoma parrots, rainbows, bushes with berries, leaves, rain, clouds, lightning and fine-line snowflakes. Marie was the matriarch of the Chino family of potters. She helped her children and grandchildren learn the fine art of pottery making and had many students.

As Auburn's starting quarterback from 2005 to 2007 he guided the Tigers to a 29‚Äì9 record and was a member of the winningest senior class in Auburn history, winning 50 games during their time on the Plains. Cox attended Hewitt-Trussville High School, the same school as Jay Barker, former quarterback for rival Alabama. He was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis in his 10th grade year in high school, but fought the disease and continued to play football.Meet Mr. Football: Brandon Cox overcomes for ‚Äô06 season Cox, a left-hander, was recruited to Auburn in 2003 but redshirted his freshman year. After serving one season as backup, Cox stumbled to begin the 2005 season before leading the Tigers to a 9‚Äì3 finish. He returned his junior year in 2006 to lead Auburn to an 11‚Äì2 finish, including a victory over Nebraska in the 2007 Cotton Bowl Classic. Cox began the season as the starter for the third season for the Tigers in 2007. Prior to the season, Cox was one of 35 quarterbacks named to the 2007 Manning Award Watch List. For much of the 2007 season, Cox struggled to find consistency behind an offensive line starting three freshmen. He was briefly benched in favor of true freshman quarterback Kodi Burns during the Mississippi State game. Cox rebounded from being benched to lead Auburn to victories over undefeated Florida, Arkansas and Alabama. In winning the 2007 Iron Bowl over Alabama, 17‚Äì10, the team set a school record with six consecutive wins over its rival. Cox became only the second Auburn quarterback to be 3‚Äì0 against Alabama, with his predecessor, Jason Campbell, being the other quarterback to record this feat. Cox's last win came in the 2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl when he led Auburn past Clemson, 23‚Äì20 (OT). Cox completed a career-high 25 passes, but it was Burns who ended the game with a touchdown run in overtime. Cox finished the regular season of his senior year with a 117.58 passer rating. As of the 2007 Iron Bowl, Cox had 6,748 career passing yards, a 59.12% completion percentage (525/888), 42 touchdowns on 31 interceptions for a career NCAA passer rating of 131.58. After leaving Auburn with a business administration degree, Cox became an account manager for Ready Mix USA. He later worked in the construction industry, serving as commercial leasing associate for Daniel Corporation and later the Director of Business Development for Hoar Construction.

He is known also as Pablo de Santa Maria, Paul de Santa Maria, and Paulus episcopus Burgensis. His original name was Solomon ha- Levi. Early life He was the most wealthy and influential Jew of Burgos, an erudite scholar of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, and a rabbi of the Jewish community. His father, Isaac ha-Levi , had come from Aragon to Burgos in the middle of the fourteenth century. Solomon ha-Levi also apparently filled the office of tax-farmer at the same time. According to Graetz, his scholarship and intelligence, no less than his piety, won the praise of Isaac ben Sheshet, with whom he carried on a learned correspondence. This assertion is disputed by Atlas and Hershman as anachronistic; \\"...the disparity in age between Paul de Burgos and Perfet renders the assumption of Graetz untenable.\\" Hershman, Rabbi Isaac ben Sheshet Perfet and His Times page 181. Isaac ben Sheshet, Responsa, Nos. 183-192 Conversion He received Christian baptism on 21 July 1391 at Burgos, taking the name Paul de Santa Mar√≠a. French historian Leon Poliakov writes that he converted in the aftermath of the great massacres of Jews which began on 6 June 1391.Poliakov, Leon The History of Anti-Semitism, Volume 2, pages 160-1 University of Pennsylvania Press: 2003 He himself said that he had been convinced by the works of Thomas Aquinas. At the same time his brothers Pedro Su√°rez and Alvar Garc√≠a, his sister Mar√≠a Nu√±ez, and his children, one daughter and four sons, aged from three to twelve years, were baptized. His wife, Joanna, whom he had married in his twenty-sixth year, remained faithful to Judaism, dying in that faith in 1420; she was afterward buried in the Church of S. Pablo, built by her husband. Controversy Following his conversion, Paul, like fellow convert Joshua ha-Lorki (Ger√≥nimo de Santa Fe) took an active role in persecuting Spanish Jews. Kenneth Levin has stated that when a wave of forced conversions of Jews to Christianity began in 1411, Paul \\"took a leading role in the assault on Spain‚Äôs remaining Jews and was responsible for drawing up edicts that isolated the Jews, stripped them of many communal rights, and, most importantly, deprived them of almost all means of earning a living, leaving them with the choice of death by privation for themselves and their families or conversion.\\" Jewish historians have strongly suggested that Paul converted for social and economic (as opposed to religious) reasons following a wave of anti-Jewish violence and forced conversions throughout Spain in 1391.The Psychology of Collaborators in the War against Israel and the Jews by Jamie Glazov, Frontpage Magazine, October 19, 2009.Jews in Spain 06: The Conversos 1391-1492 - the expulsion of 1492 , Encyclopaedia Judaica 1971, Vol. 15, presented by Michael Palomino (2008) at Encyclopaedia Judaica. Later life Paul spent some years at the University of Paris, receiving the degree of doctor of theology after several years. He then visited London, where he probably remained only a short time, sending a Hebrew satire on Purim to Don Me√Ør Alguades from that city.Israel Abrahams, \\"Paul de Burgos in London,\\" in \\"J.Q.R.\\" xii.255 et seq.; Steinschneider, \\"Cat. Leyden,\\" No. 64, 7 Castle of Olmillos de Sasam√≥n, known as \\"The Castle of the Fleur de Lis\\", built by his son Pedro de Cartagena in 1446 He was appointed archdeacon of Trevi√±o, and in 1402 (or 1405) became Bishop of Cartagena; and in 1415, Archbishop of Burgos. He was succeeded in the see of Burgos by his second son, Archbishop Alfonso of Burgos. His intelligence and scholarship, as well as his gift of oratory, gained for him the confidence of King Henry III of Castile, who in 1406 appointed him keeper of the royal seal, in succession to Pero Lopez de Ayala. In 1416 King Henry named him Lord Chancellor. After the king's death Archbishop Paul was a member of the council which ruled Castile in the name of the regent Do√±a Catalina, and by the will of the deceased king he was tutor to the heir to the throne, the later John II of Castile. Relationship to Judaism Paul, who even after he had been baptized continued to correspond with several Jews, including Joseph Orabuena, chief rabbi of Navarre, and Joshua ibn Vives, became a bitter enemy of Judaism. He tried his best, frequently with success, to convert his former coreligionists. In the same spirit the chief object of the edict which he drafted as chancellor of the kingdom, and which was promulgated in the name of the regent, the widowed queen mother Catherine of Lancaster, at Valladolid on January 2 (not 12), 1412, was the conversion of the Jews. This law, which consisted of twenty-four articles, was designed to separate the Jews entirely from the Christians, to paralyze their commerce, to humiliate them, and to expose them to contempt, requiring them either to live within the close quarters of their ghetto or to accept baptism. Impelled by his hatred of Talmudic Judaism, Paul in the year preceding his death composed the Dialogus Pauli et Sauli Contra Jud√¶os, sive Scrutinium Scripturarum (Mantua, 1475; Mayence, 1478; Paris, 1507, 1535; Burgos, 1591), which subsequently served as a source for Alfonso de Spina, Geronimo de Santa F√©, and other Spanish writers hostile to the Jews, and Martin Luther in Germany for his treatise On the Jews and their Lies. A few years after his baptism he wrote Additiones (which consist of addenda to Nicholas of Lyra's postils on the Bible, and have been frequently printed), and in his old age a Historia Universal in Spanish verse. Works The published writings of Archbishop Paul were: *Dialogus Pauli et Sauli contra Jud√¶os, sive Scrutinium scripturarum (Mantua, 1475; Mains, 1478; Paris, 1507, 1535; Burgos, 1591). *Additiones to the Postilla of Nicholas of Lyra (Nuremberg, 1481; 1485; 1487, etc.; Venice, 1481, 1482, etc.). It is chiefly on the latter work that Paul's reputation as an exegete rests. The Additiones were originally mere marginal notes written in a volume of the Postilla which he sent to his son Alfonso. Their publication aroused Matthias D√∂ring, the provincial of the Saxon Franciscans, to publish his Replic√¶, a bitter rejection of almost half of the 1,100 suggestions and additions Paul had made. * De nomine divino qu√¶stiones duodecim (Utrecht, 1707).

He was educated at Eton and at King's College, Cambridge, graduating Master of Arts in 1773. Orde entered politics as Tory Member of Parliament for Aylesbury (1780‚Äì1784) and later for Harwich (1784‚Äì1796). He served as Secretary to the Treasury (1782‚Äì1783) and as Chief Secretary for Ireland (1784‚Äì1787). Around 1782, he was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland, and in 1785, to HM Privy Council. He was Governor of the Isle of Wight (1791‚Äì1807) and Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire (1800‚Äì1807). On 7 January 1795, by Royal Licence, he assumed the additional surname of Powlett, and on 20 October 1797 he was created Baron Bolton.

Background Johnstown was a bay horse bred at Claiborne Farm. He was purchased by William Woodward, Sr. and raced under his Belair Stable banner. Racing career After a successful season racing at age two when he won seven of his twelve starts, in the spring of 1939 Johnstown gave trainer Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons his third straight Wood Memorial Stakes, an important stepping stone to the U.S. Triple Crown races. The heavy favorite going into the Kentucky Derby, Johnstown got off to a slow start under jockey James Stout, then he took command by the mile pole and defeated Challedon by eight lengths, tying the (still current, 2015) record for margin of victory. In the Preakness Stakes, it came up muddy (he never raced on an off-track before or after), and Johnstown finished 5th to winner Challedon. With Challedon not eligible for the Belmont Stakes, Johnstown easily won the final leg of the U.S. Triple Crown races. He later won several more important races and wound up his highly successful season with seven wins in nine starts. Stud record Retired to stud at Claiborne Farm, Johnstown met with modest success as a sire, producing winners of only six stakes races. However, he was a leading broodmare sire during the 1950s with his most famous offspring being Hall of Famer Nashua. Johnstown died in 1950 at the age of fourteen and was buried in the equine cemetery at Claiborne Farm. He was posthumously inducted into the United States' National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1992. His portrait by artist Martin Stainforth can be seen as part of the museum's equine collection.

Two consuls were elected each year to head the government of the state, and in the early to mid-Republic were assigned a consular army and an area in which to campaign. History From Gaius Marius and Sulla onwards, control of the army began to be tied into the political ambitions of individuals, leading to the political triumvirate of the late 1st century BC and its resolution in a civil war that led to the Republic's collapse. The Empire was increasingly plagued by usurpations led or supported by military conspiracies, leading to the Crisis of the Third Century (A.D. 235‚Äì284) in the late empire and eventual final decline. Following is a list of topics on the military history of ancient Rome. * Structural history of the Roman military :The branches of the Roman military at the highest level were the Roman army and the Roman navy. Within these branches the actual structure was subject to substantial change throughout its history. * Campaign history of the Roman military :The history of Rome is inseparable from its military history over the roughly thirteen centuries that the Roman state existed. The core of the military campaigns of ancient Rome is the account of the Roman military's land battles, from the conquest of Italy to its fights against the Huns and invading Germanic peoples. Naval battles were largely less important, although there are notable exceptions during, for instance, the First Punic War and others. :The Roman army battled first against its tribal neighbors and Etruscan towns within Italy, and later came to dominate much of the land surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, including the provinces of Britannia and Asia Minor at the Empire's height. * Technological history of the Roman military :From sticks and stones to ballistae and quinqueremes. * Political history of the Roman military :From subjects of the state to subjects of the general.

Biography He was born in Maple Valley, Ohio, to Lydia Meyer and Levi E. Fetzer. After graduating from Akron's West High School, he worked as suburban reporter for the Akron Times, where in 1920 he began his column Pippins and Cheese, taking its title and his pen name from William Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor. Except for a short sabbatical serving as managing editor of the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) and head of the Cleveland's The Plain Dealers Akron bureau, Fetzer remained with the Times until its merger into the Akron Times-Press. Herman married Hazel May Stevenson on August 5, 1922 in Akron. Together, they had no children. Herman died January 17, 1935 from pneumonia. Fetzer was buried in Canaan, Ohio. http://www.findagrave.com/memorial/38008974/herman-fetzer He is listed in the encyclopaedia of Cleveland History. https://case.edu/ech/articles/f/fetzer- herman Career He worked briefly for the Akron Beacon Journal and published several books, two of them based on his Teutonic folk hero, Reini Kugel. While working at the Akron Beacon Journal, his desk sat adjacent to writer Josephine Van de Grift, columnist of Demi-Tasse and Mrs. Grundy. He was Josephine's neighbor when he lived at 508 Buchtel Avenue in Akron. Upon her death in 1927, Herman wrote a full front page tribute to Josephine for the Akron Beacon Journal on August 23, 1927 which was reprinted in November of the same year. Fetzer's reputation spread as he published articles, poems, and stories in The New Yorker, The Nation, Collier's, and Liberty. In the summers of 1929 and 1930, he wrote the Conning Tower column for the vacationing Franklin Pierce Adams in the New York World. Lured to the Cleveland Press early in 1930, Fetzer not only contributed Pippins and Cheese but also did rewrites, editorials, and features until his early death from lung cancer. Largely through the efforts of his widow, Hazel, several volumes of his work were published posthumously: The Bulls of Spring: Selected Poems (1937); 3 volumes of Ohio farm stories culled from a \\"Rural Vacation\\" series composed for the Press; a representative Fetzer anthology, Pippins and Cheese (1960); and Jake Falstaff Selections to Make You Thirsty (1969). An inventory of his works is held in a repository at the University of Akron. The collection consists of manuscripts, correspondence, newspaper clippings, photographs and miscellaneous material concerning Fetzer's life and work as a newspaper man and writer.

The purpose of a clutch is in part to allow such control; in particular, a clutch provides transfer of torque between shafts spinning at different speeds. In the extreme, clutch control is used in performance driving, such as starting from a dead stop with the engine producing maximum torque at high RPM. Overview With the clutch pedal completely pressed or a motorcycle's lever pulled entirely towards the driver, there is no direct link between the engine and the driveshaft, so no power can pass from the engine to the driveshaft and wheels. With the pedal entirely released, there is full contact between the engine and the driveshaft, via the clutch plate, which means that the engine can apply power directly to the driveshaft. However, it is possible to have the clutch plate partially engaged, allowing the clutch to slip. As a result, only a fraction of the power from the engine reaches the driveshaft, which is commonly known as half clutch. Benefits There are benefits to the use of clutch control in specific circumstances: =Low gear and low speed= When a car is in first gear, small variations in engine speed translate to large changes in acceleration and engine braking. However, with a combination of clutch control and careful use of engine speed, a much smoother ride can be achieved by allowing the clutch to slip. Variations in engine revs are not immediately translated into changes in drive shaft rotation speed, but rather the friction on the clutch plate allows the drive shaft to gradually equalize with the speed of the engine. At a certain point while gently lifting the clutch, the car will begin to move as the clutch starts to slip, referred to as the biting point. Here, the accelerator pedal should be gently depressed to slowly increase the car's speed. Once the car reaches a suitable speed, the clutch can be fully engaged and speed can then be controlled either by varying the engine speed or by partially disengaging the clutch again if necessary. This particular use of clutch control is frequently taught to learning drivers as a way to control acceleration when pulling away from a complete stop or when driving at very slow speeds while minimizing the chance of stalling the engine. =Uphill start= :For mechanical aids to hill-starting, see Hill- holder and Hill Start Assist When pulling away on an uphill slope, the chance of stalling the engine is greater, and so it can be beneficial to engage the clutch more slowly than normal while revving higher than normal. =Adverse road conditions= In adverse road conditions, notably snow or ice, it is recommended to pull away in as low a gear as possible to minimize torque on the wheels and thereby maintain traction with the road. Pulling away requires progressively slower engagement of the clutch as the gear increases, and in a high gear it is necessary to engage the clutch slowly to avoid the increased risk of stalling the engine, or, in the case of adverse weather conditions, spinning the wheels. =Balancing the clutch= Normally, when a vehicle is stationary on an uphill slope it is necessary to use the handbrake in conjunction with clutch control to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards when pulling away. However, in situations where the vehicle must be stopped briefly, for example in slow moving traffic, the clutch can be used to balance the uphill force from the engine with the downhill force of gravity. The benefit of this is that there is no need for the hand- or foot-brake, and the driver can pull away more quickly, and sometimes even the accelerator is used with the partially engaged clutch as the clutch alone cannot 'handle' such a steep incline and instead the engine would just stall. Using this option will wear out the clutch more quickly, however in some steep inclines with stop- start moving traffic, it is the easiest option as using the handbrake would be time-consuming. =Deceleration= Typically with motorcycles and in motor sport, the clutch is often used to facilitate the use of resistance from the engine spinning at high speeds to decelerate the vehicle more quickly, often accompanied with normal braking. This can be achieved by placing the vehicle in a gear that would ordinarily be too low for the current speed and momentum of the vehicle and by partly engaging the clutch. When this happens, momentum energy from the inertia of the vehicle is taken away to spin the engine as close as possible to its maximum capability. As the vehicle is decelerating, the clutch can be further released to transfer more energy to keep the engine spinning as quickly as possible. This method causes excessive clutch wear, however, and it could cause severe engine damage or wheel lockup if the clutch were to be released suddenly. A better method is to downshift to a lower gear that would spin the engine within its RPM limit and use the throttle to \\"rev match\\" the engine to the road speed before releasing the clutch fully. Effective engine braking is still achieved with little or no excessive clutch wear. Once the clutch is entirely released and the vehicle has decelerated some, this cycle proceeds downwards through the gears to further assist deceleration. If the clutch is controlled improperly while this is being attempted, damage or extra wear to the engine and gears is possible, as well as the risk of wheels locking up and a subsequent loss of proper vehicle control. Problems Even normal use of clutch control increases the wear (and decreases the lifespan) of the clutch. Excessive use of clutch control or \\"riding the clutch\\" will cause further damage. =Prolonged use= While the use of clutch control at low speed can be used to obtain greater control of acceleration and engine braking, once a car has picked up sufficient speed the clutch should be fully engaged (pedal released). =Excessive engine revolutions= Excessively revving the engine while using clutch control, or keeping the clutch partially engaged while accelerating with the gas pedal, can cause unnecessary damage to the clutch. Slipping the clutch Slipping the clutch (sometimes referred to as feathering the clutch) is a term used by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and releases the clutch to achieve some movement of the car. It's called slipping because the clutch plate will slip against the flywheel surface when such an action is performed. Slipping the clutch is known to be hard on the clutch surface due to the sliding friction created. Drivers can frequently be observed slipping the clutch when they are trying to stay stationary on a hill without using neutral and the brake. They apply the clutch to climb a bit, then release to roll back, then apply again, etc. so that the car stays in about the same place. With enough practice, alternating is no longer needed. Applying the correct amount of clutch pressure and throttle causes just enough force from the engine to counter gravity and keep the vehicle stationary (see balancing the clutch). The alternative to this technique of staying stationary on a hill would be to put the vehicle in neutral and apply the brake. Slipping the clutch is a popular term in drag racing culture and is done when launching a car, usually in a drag race. Some contend that slipping the clutch is the best way to launch a front-wheel drive (FWD) car as it prevents torque steering that many FWD cars experience when too much power is put to the front wheels. Riding the clutch In a vehicle with a manual transmission, riding the clutch refers to the practice of needlessly keeping the clutch partially disengaged. This results in the clutch being unable to fully engage with the flywheel and so causes premature wear on the disc and flywheel. A common example of riding the clutch is to keep slight continual pressure on the clutch pedal whilst driving, as when a driver habitually rests his/her foot on the clutch pedal instead of on the floorboard or dead pedal. Although this slight pressure is not enough to allow the clutch disc itself to slip, it is enough to keep the release bearing against the release springs. This causes the bearing to remain spinning, which leads to premature bearing failure. When shifting properly, the driver \\"shifts\\" to another gear and then releases pressure on the clutch pedal to re-engage the engine to the driveshaft. If the pedal is released quickly, a definite lurch can be felt as the engine and driveshaft re-engage and their speeds equalize. However, if the clutch is released slowly the clutch disc will \\"slip\\" against the flywheel; this friction permits the engine a smoother transition to its new rotation speed. Such routine slippage causes wear on the clutch analogous to the wear-and-tear on a brake pad when stopping. Some amount of wear is unavoidable, but with better clutching/shifting technique it can be minimized by releasing the clutch as close to the correct engine speed for the gear and vehicle speed as possible. When upshifting, this will involve allowing the engine speed to fall. Conversely, when downshifting, increasing the engine speed with the accelerator prior to releasing clutch will result in a smoother transition and minimal clutch wear. Riding the clutch occurs when the driver does not fully release the clutch pedal. This results in the clutch disc slipping against the flywheel and some engine power not being transferred to the drive train and wheels. While inefficient, most drivers routinely use this technique effectively when driving in reverse (as fully engaging the reverse gear results in velocity too great for the short distance traveled) or in stop-and- go traffic (as it is easier to control the throttle and acceleration at very slow speeds). Riding the clutch should not be confused with \\"freewheeling\\" or \\"coasting\\", where the clutch is pressed down fully allowing the car to roll either downhill or from inertia. While this is not damaging to the car, it can be considered a dangerous way to drive since one forgoes the ability to quickly accelerate if needed. It is, however, a common practice to roll into a parking space or over speed bumps via inertia.

Bio Lobotomia was born in 1984 playing songs in an absolutely hardcore way. Its original formation was Caio on vocals, Adherbal Billy Argel on guitars, Grego on drums and Alfredo on bass. Punk movement was on the rise and places like Napalm, Carbono 14, Lira Paulistana, Madame Sat√£, √Åcido Pl√°stico and others were welcoming bands of this kind. In the end of 1985, Lobotomia was part of the Ataque Sonoro compilation by the independent label Ataque Frontal and in this album is already visible the change in the band's musical style, on a search for a new sonority and the starting fusion with other heavy sound styles. Along with the bands C√≥lera, Garotos Podres, Ratos de Por√£o, Armagedom, V√≠rus 27, Grinders, Desordeiros and Auschwitz, they made this album remarkable in the history of Brazilian punk. In 1986, with Caio on vocals, Adherbal on guitars, Grego on drums and Zez√© on bass they get ready to record what was going to be the first Brazilian ‚Äúmetalpunk‚Äù disc, the style that later will lead to what is known today as crossover. The LP Lobotomia vinyl was recorded and produced by the band while the New Face Records collaborated with pressing and distribution in 1987. This album has a characteristic metallic, dark and innovative sound that was different from everything that was heard in terms of punk in Brazil until then. In this work can be found the rerecording of Faces da Morte and also the band's classics like S√≥ Os Mortos N√£o Reclamam and Indigentes do Amanh√£, with lyrics by Adherbal and Caio. This record was remarkable because even though it was a heavy and completely out of the 80's market standards, one of its songs ‚ÄúS√≥ Os Mortos N√£o Reclamam‚Äù was on the regular schedule of the 89 FM radio station, which was entitled Radio Rock. At that times it was inconceivable to play this musical genre on the radio, especially if the station had a more alternative profile. In this phase, Lobotomia suffers one more change. For the live concerts they called Paulo, who was friends with the vocalist Caio, to take a place on the second guitar. With this formation they gave many concerts in the S√£o Paulo underground. In 1988, Zez√© and Caio quit the band and gave room to Flavinho on bass and Guba on vocals. At this phase were written most of the next album songs, with three of the lyrics written by Guba. When Guba left, Markon assumes the vocals, and with this formation they enter a studio in Belo Horizonte and recorded in 1989, by the label Cogumelo Discos, the LP Nada √â Como Parece. The sound showed itself more cohesive when mixing styles, looking more like headbanger sound but still did not have the title of crossover. By the end of the recordings the band closes a circle and temporarily cease their activities after a few more concerts. In 2002, the band (Markon, Adherbal, Paulo, Grego and Picapau) gets reunited for a concert with Agnostic Front. In 2003 the first album's CD ‚ÄúLobotomia‚Äù is relaunched in Japan by the record company SpeedStates. In 2004 the band returns to action but now with only one member of the original formation: the drummer Grego. The guitarist is Joz√© (ex- Kangaroos In Tilt), bassist Fralda (ex-Ratos de Por√£o) and Markon on vocals. Many concerts were made around the country in Brazil with this formation. With the departure of Z√©, the band returns to the Nada √â Como Parece formation, with the exception of Flavinho, who was substituted by Fralda, who later would be replaced by Carlos ‚ÄúCarlinhos‚Äù. In January 2008 Grego, Adherbal, Paulo, Markon and Carlos entered a studio to record one more album called Extin√ß√£o, with 13 songs that combine several styles moving between hardcore, punk and thrash metal. After the recording, Adherbal and Paulo quit the band again and Carlos changes focus to his band ‚ÄúPresto?‚Äù. In 2009 Fralda returns to the band, Andr√© (Presto?) assumes the guitars and the band present a few more concerts to spread the new album Extin√ß√£o. In July 2009, with the formation Grego, Markon, Fralda and Andr√©, Lobotomia finally leave the country for their first European tour. In 2011 is the band's second European tour, longer and visiting more countries. Right after the second tour Markon leaves the band along with the guitarist Spock. Guilherme Goto joins the band when only 15 years old and assumes the guitars. Edu Vudoo enters as the new vocalist. In 2013 Fralda also leaves the band and is substituted by Gabriel Kaspar, that in 2015 is replaced by Daniel Brita (Pig Soul and M√£o Santa). With the new formation of Edu Vudoo, Guilherme Goto, Daniel Brita and Grego, Lobotomia records the fourth album ‚ÄúDesastre‚Äù, acclaimed by the critics and the fans right after being released, in 2016. Still in 2015, right after the recordings of the new album the band makes its third European tour. In 2016 the album has a disclosure tour in Brazil and an unprecedented tour of Mexico. The tour involves 14 concerts in 12 cities and surprises the band with the number of fans and welcome. The band is currently already preparing and working on new material and setting a new European tour for 2018. Lobotomia is a hardcore/crossover thrash band that left a mark on the 80's and today is still a reference for many bands who follow this style.

Halberstam tomb with his initials in Rashi script Solomon Joachim Chayim Halberstam (February 23, 1832‚ÄìMarch 24, 1900) known from his acronym as ShaZHaH (◊©◊ñ◊ó◊î), was an Austrian scholar and author born at Cracow. His father, Isaac Halberstam, was a prominent merchant who devoted his leisure time to study, and left in manuscript a work which Solomon published in his honor under the title Sia·∏• Yi·∫ì·∏•a·∏≥, Lemberg, 1882. This work contains also notices on the genealogy of Halberstam, who numbered eminent rabbis among his ancestors both on his father's and on his mother's side. In 1860 he settled at Bielitz as a prosperous merchant. The larger part of his time, however, he devoted to Jewish learning, and a considerable part of his income to increasing his library, which was especially rich in rare and valuable manuscripts, the love of collecting having been developed in him early. For half a century he corresponded widely with the representatives of Jewish learning of all shades of opinion; he took part in learned discussions on the most diverse questions, contributing to nearly all the periodical papers written in Hebrew and in other languages. Halberstam was one of the directors and chief supporters of both the old and the new Me·∏≥i·∫ìe Nirdamim, the publications of which include contributions from him. He contributed valuable introductions to the works of a great number of Hebrew writers, and was also a collaborator on collective works, such as the jubilee or memorial volumes in honor of Gr√§tz, Steinschneider, Kohut, and Kaufmann. Halberstam's editions are: * ·∏§iddushe ha- Ri·π≠ba'al Niddah, novell√¶ and discussions on the tractate Niddah by R.

The greater part of them was acquired by Montefiore College, Ramsgate, England, while his large collection of printed books, and a considerable number also of manuscripts, was bought by Mayer Sulzberger and presented to the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.

Ideals and policies ROOD's main goals are the promotion of a socialist society and promotion of its mother party and attempts to attract new people into it.  Organisation  Formally, ROOD has been a vereniging (voluntary association) since 2003 with the goal to let young people participate in creating a socialist society in the Netherlands and to support the SP. Between 1999 and 2003, ROOD was a group within the party, initially subtitled \\"young initiative within the SP\\". It was the successor of the \\"J-team\\". Locally, ROOD is organised in groups within political and financial responsibility of the local SP-section. There exist criteria for forming a group, such as a minimum number of (active) members. The number of groups is continuously fluctuating, but was 20 on average in 2005. Stable groups exist in Amsterdam, Delft, Den Bosch, Groningen, Utrecht and Den Haag. ROOD-members can be anyone between 14 and 28. They have to be a member of the SP, except for members below 16 years of age. Nationally, ROOD has a board consisting of five people with a varying number of supporting advisors. The board, elected nationally, coordinates the groups and organises nationwide action campaign and activities such as education and excursions. In May 2012 Lieke Smits was elected chairperson. She is the successor of Leon Botter, who was chairman between 2009 and 2012. He was elected after Eva Gerrebrands stepped down. She was the successor of Gijsbert Houtbeckers, who was chairperson since June 2007, succeeding Renske Leijten who held the position since June 2005. The first formal chairperson since ROOD was founded was between 2003 and 2005. Before that, he had been part of the board of the group ROOD since 1999, whose chairpeople were (1999‚Äì2000) and Gerrie Elfrink (2000‚Äì2002).  Activities and stances  Although formally independent, ROOD (contrary to other political youth organisations) does not take any stances that are different from that of the party. The main activities of ROOD are political activism and educating its members. =Campaigns= In 2003, ROOD was active protesting against the obligation for all citizens to be always able to identify themselves, and against cuts in education. There were also buildings occupied to attract attention to the lack of housing for young people and at various universities, actions were held for fair trade coffee at universities. ROOD also sent a representative to the European Social Forum (ESF) in Paris. Since 2003, ROOD organises a yearly Huisjesmelker van het Jaar vote, where students vote for the worst private landlord in the country. Since 2005, this poll is organised in cooperation with the and local councils of that organisation. In 2004, ROOD started a campaign against animal testing in the cosmetics industry, in 2005 L'Or√©al were targeted to stop animal testing when ROOD visited delivered a signed petition to the company. ROOD also campaigns on international themes such as globalisation. In 2005, ROOD facilitated an exposition by young Palestinians about their culture, in different Dutch cities. After a visit of ROOD members to the occupied areas in Palestine, a declaration of friendship was signed with the football club Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin, by ROOD referred to as \\"FC Bnei Sakhnin\\". In the Netherlands, ROOD started a supporters club for this Arab Israeli club. ROOD also participated in the successful campaign against the European Constitution with the slogan \\"Zeg je ja of denk je na\\" (\\"do you say yes, or do you think?\\").

Also in 2006, ROOD started the website www.watvooreikelszijnjullie.nl, a parody of the government website www.watvooreikelbenjij.nl, meant to teach values to young people. ROOD's stated reasons for the satirical site are that the government site represents a waste of public money (ca. 1 million euro for the campaign) and that the language used by the government site lacks respect (wat voor eikel ben jij can be translated as what kind of dick are you). ROOD also criticised the fact that this site was obviously linked to MSN, which means free publicity for Microsoft. Since 2007, ROOD has been organising actions for the improvement of the education system. The main focus of these actions was against the '1040 hour norm' (a norm that forces schools to give an unrealistic high amount of lessons, creating a huge amount of 'free hours' for students). This 1040 norm caused a spontaneous all-out strike among secondary school students. =Publications = ROOD publishes two student newspapers: * The Blikopener (eyeopener), for HBO and university students; * The Code ROOD (code red), for all youths between the age of 14 and 28. The Code ROOD appears four times a year and contains political comments and news about activities by ROOD. The Blikopener appears twice a year. They are distributed free of charge at schools, and in some places are distributed at homes in areas with many students. Until 2006, ROOD had a monthly page in the party magazine, the Tribune. Since 2006, ROOD is distributing the ROOD-magazine for its members. It is distributed twice a year and will contain in-depth political analysis for ROOD-members. Relation to the SP ROOD op het 22e SP-congres, 2017 Unlike other political youth organisations, ROOD is closely linked to the party. For the municipal elections in 2006, 10% of the elected candidates are from ROOD, and for the legislative elections in 2006, former chairperson Renske Leijten is at number 9 on the candidate list, and was one of the youngest candidates for parliament. By 2008, three members of parliament have a history within ROOD, being Farshad Bashir, Manja Smits and Renske Leijten. Within the national SP, ROOD is represented within the party management, and locally it is tried to represent ROOD in many local sections to coordinate activities. As of 2008, ROOD had 28 local groups.

Characters X-Men: Professor X, Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Rogue, Gambit, Beast, Jean Grey, Jubilee Supporting Characters Magneto, Morph, Mjnari Villains: Shadow King Synopsis This episode begins in Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa. At the Mountain, a young boy named Mjnari with the power of super speed (similar to Quicksilver) sees a portal opening at the mountain, but no one else sees it. Then Shadow King comes out of the portal and possess Mjnari. Jean Grey senses that something odd is going on in that part of Africa. Beast finds that it is a tear in the Astral Plane of the planet from Bishop's time- travel. Soon Storm comes and looks at the map and says that it's near her village. So, Storm and Rogue go to Africa. When the girls get there they find the crops destroyed and on fire, so Storm creates rain and stops the fire. Then the villagers tell her that Mjnari, who is Storm's prot√©g√© and the son of her best friend, did all this. It turns out that the Shadow king captured Mjnari's body, so he could convince Storm to take over her body. Later Shadow King comes and tells Storm to come to the Mountain to free her son. Storm goes to the mountain alone, because she thinks Shadow King could harm Mjnari. But Rogue follows her anyway. Storm agrees to let Shadow King take over her body, if he leaves Mjnari unharmed. Then Shadow King releases Mjnari, possesses Storm and leaves for Cairo. Rogue goes after Shadow King to stop him, but has hard time even getting near him and storm. Storm regains partial control of herself, so she starts going higher and higher in space to kill the Shadow King *and* herself. Shadow King starts suffocating and leaves Storm's body; she falls down, so Rogue catches her. Mjnari arrives and tells Storm that he can see the Astral portal and he wants to help her, since she became his godmother after saving his life as a newborn. So, he lures shadow king into the portal; when the portal starts closing, Mjnari gets out with his super- speed, but Shadow King is trapped in the Astral Plane again. Later Storm and Rogue leave and return to the mansion. Meanwhile, in Upper Amazon, Brazil, Wolverine is there to find Morph. He finally finds him, working at a bar. Wolverine wants to bring him back to the X-Mansion, so that Professor X can help him get better, but Morph doesn't want to go back. He turn into Jean and cruelly mocks Wolverine, emotionally disturbing him and giving himself a chance to escape. Wolverine goes after him in rage. Wolverine finds him in a mine and has a short battle with Morph, again trying to reason with his maddened friend. Morph turns into Sabretooth, among other things, and injures Wolverine; he says he has to heal his psychological damage on his own and runs away. Wolverine decides to stop chasing Morph, accepting that he needs time, and vows that he and the X-Men will wait until then. In Antarctica, the Professor and Magneto come out the snow after they had been trapped under avalanche in the previous episode, Till Death Do Us Part (Part 2). Here they find a rain forest in Antarctica. Magneto tells Professor Xavier that this place is called the Savage Land. Here Xavier's legs start working, and he can walk again, but both of them have lost their powers. Suddenly two men riding on a bird called Aerians, grab Xavier and Magneto and drop them in a river. Then Xavier and Magneto fall down a waterfall, and the episode ends. Production Professor Xavier's ability to walk while in the Savage Land is never properly explained on the show, though in the comics, his (second) body was crippled due to injuries sustained on the astral plane, meaning he physically was fine, but his mutant-powered mind would \\"tell\\" his body he was crippled. Without his powers here, the barriers imposed by that mental injury aren't enforced. In the comics, this was due to the Shadow King, coincidentally enough, but the show's version of events is hinted at in season 4's \\"Sanctuary Part 1\\" and involve Magneto instead. Reception The episode was not positively received and has been described as \\"arguably the poorest episode of the season\\". The episodes focus on Storm is believed to give the episode a \\"dull\\" feeling. Also, The Shadow King was perceived to be a boring villain. The sub-plot involving Wolverine and Morph, however, was more likeable. The morphing cameos have been described as \\"cool\\".

He won two Eclipse Awards in 1990. Background A descendant of Nearco, he was bred at the famed Calumet Farm in Lexington, Kentucky and owned in partnership with Jurgen K. Arnemann. He was sired by Alydar out of the mare Klepto, making him a half-brother to the Eclipse Award winning turf mare Estrapade and the Italian Group One winner Isopach.http://www.pedigreequery.com/progeny/klepto It was perhaps because of the success of his siblings on turf that he was originally sent to be trained in Europe. Racing career He was first sent to race in France. There, racing on grass, Criminal Type was a winner at age two, but after a poor three-year-old season he was brought back to the United States and turned over to trainer D. Wayne Lukas. In 1990, at age four, Criminal Type began to show promise on the U.S. dirt tracks, then at age five he won seven of eleven races entered and earned two Eclipse Awards including the most prestigious award of all, the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. Criminal Type won four consecutive Grade 1 races: The Pimlico Special, the Metropolitan Handicap, the Hollywood Gold Cup, and the Whitney Handicap. In his wins, Criminal Type defeated 1989 Horse of the Year, Sunday Silence, eventual 1991 Horse of the Year, Black Tie Affair, U.S. Outstanding Sprint Horse Housebuster, and winner of the Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse and Hall of Famer, 1989 Belmont Stakes winner Easy Goer; however, Criminal Type carried seven pounds less than Easy Goer, and five pounds less than Sunday Silence, in their respective match-ups. Other quality horses vanquished by Criminal Type include Opening Verse, Lively One, Ruhlmann, and Flying Continental. Criminal Type was the last champion to run in the Calumet Farm devil's red and blue colors. Stud career After suffering an injury in the Woodward Stakes, Criminal Type was retired to stand at stud at Calumet Farm where he sired two graded stakes race winners before he was sent in 1993 to a breeding farm in Japan. Criminal Type was the broodmare sire of 2003 Travers Stakes winner, Ten Most Wanted. Criminal Type died in Japan at age twenty on March 9, 2005 from a ruptured stomach. He had been scheduled to be returned to America as a pensioner at Old Friends Equine in Kentucky. Hall of Fame nominee Criminal Type has been a regular nominee to the Horse Racing Hall of Fame, but has yet to be named a finalist for induction. Many believe that Criminal Type has been overlooked by the Hall of Fame due to the scandals that engulfed Calumet Farm in the early 1990s, including the alleged killing of Criminal Type's sire, Alydar for insurance proceeds. A Federal judge in the Houston Division of Texas found Calumet and its President not responsible for the payment of the insurance pay-out on Alydar.

MSC's other Lake Tanganyika ferry, , operates the route to Zambia. History Mwongozo was built by a Finnish company for the Tanzania Railways Corporation. Her original route was a weekly return route from Bujumbura, Burundi to Mpulungu, Zambia, calling at Kigoma, Tanzania and various small settlements along the Tanzanian coast of the lake. In 1997 the UNHCR used Mwongozo and Liemba to transport more than 75,000 refugees, who had fled Zaire during the First Congo War, back to their homeland following the overthrow of longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Also in 1997, TRC's inland shipping division became a separate company, the Marine Services Company Ltd.

Indirect evidence has implicated viral infection in the etiology of subacute thyroiditis. This evidence is limited to preceding upper respiratory tract infection, elevated viral antibody levels, and both seasonal and geographical clustering of cases. There may be a genetic predisposition. Nishihara and coworkers studied the clinical features of subacute thyroiditis in 852 mostly 40- to 50-year-old women in Japan.

Signed to Edinburgh's Human Condition Records, Sputniks Down (named after a song by Lou Barlow's Folk Implosion) were a three piece from Bishopbriggs on the outskirts of Glasgow. They produced instrumental electronica with 'Eno-esque gorgeousness'. 'The Young Marble Giants stepping out with a prozac-ed up Godspeed You! Black Emperor while the Mary Chain bite their ankles'. Influences also included such bands as Tortoise and Mogwai. They were one of the first bands from the UK (along with fellow Glaswegians Mogwai) to play instrumental, post-rock and subsequently formed an important part of the early 2000s Glasgow music scene. Career After a handful of gigs, they were signed to Edinburgh's Human Condition record label. In January 2000, their debut EP Monotone Mountain was recorded by Tony Doogan at CaVa Studios. At the time, they were highly thought of by Keith Cameron (NME), Roy Wilkinson (Select) and Vic Galloway (BBC Radio 1 Evening Session). 'MM' was described as 'an electropopguitary lullaby'. The EP was released on 17 April 2000. The gig to celebrate the EP launch on 27 April 2000 in Avalanche, Edinburgh was reviewed by the NME. In 2001 they released their debut album, Much Was Decided Before You Were Born. The songs \\"Atonement\\" and \\"Mie Scattering\\" featured artists from El Hombre Trajaedo and Long Fin Killie (Luke Sutherland). The band played a six date tour later that year, including gigs in London (Dublin Castle), Norwich (FerryBoat), Aberdeen (Glow303/Lava/Kef) and the Life Without Buildings album launch in Glasgow. They undertook a live session for BBC Scotland, along with Brendan O'Hare, and took part in the 2001 Planet Pop Festival, and the Burnt Out Electronica Festival. Their presence at a David Pajo gig in 2002 in Glasgow was reported by the NME. Live, they were described by one journalist as \\"almost triphop with an Aphex Twin feel while the slower stuff broods with a smoky almost film-noir feel as guitars chime and keyboards swirl\\". The same year they supported Mull Historical Society, American Analog Set and Fly Pan Am. In late 2002, they were listed in Martin C. Strong's The Great Scots Discography. After a tour of Greece in 2003, the band split up. David Roy went on to play in Multiplies, and was a founder member of Dananananaykroyd. In April 2010, it was announced that the band was reforming.

Before this there was only an elementary school and the train station for the people living in the area. The location where the village is situated today was basically made up of puszta and grazing fields. In 1950 the area was measured into land lot(s), and it was on these parcels of land that the village was built. In 1951 the name B√°csfeh√©rt√≥ was given to the village, but this was changed to Kunfeh√©rt√≥ in 1952, the same year as electricity was integrated in the village. In the first period, between 1950 and 1953, around 180-190 homes were built. In the following years public buildings such as the town hall, kinder garden and post office were built. The area around the lake with all the summer cottages was until recently a popular summer holiday destination for many German, Dutch and Austrian tourists, but the last ten years, after the increasing popularity of Lake Balaton and other bigger places in Hungary, these visitors are almost absent today. Still, the yearly beer festival with its concerts, parties and entertainment attracts a great number of visitors from all over the county and Hungary. Also, every summer many children spends a week or two in summer camps or at the sports facilities near the lake. Geography It covers an area of and has a population of 2307 people (2005).

The group consisting of two sisters, Felipita Aguilar Garcia, Asuncion Aguilar Cate, and their sister in law, Mrs. Ramos Aguilar. Their pottery work together became known as Aguilar pottery, however they are sometimes referred to as the Aguilar Sisters.  History  In the early 1900s, pottery creation at Santo Domingo Pueblo had experienced a significant decline. In 1910, Julius Seligman, who worked at the Bernalillo Mercantile Company near the pueblo, noticed the decline in the sales. At his suggestion, the two sisters, Felipita Aguilar Garcia, Asuncion Aguilar Cate, and their sister in law, Mrs. Ramos Aguilar attempted to revive the dying art. The three women worked together making pottery and their work became known as ‚ÄúAguilar pottery.‚Äù The Aguilar sisters made traditional polychrome ollas, jars and dough bowls with several different styles of decoration. The painting style for which they are best known was a bold, geometric pattern with black paint on a cream colored slip or black and red on a cream slip, which almost totally obscured the cream background. This style was unique compared to the typical geometric forms of Santo Domingo pottery where areas were usually left open of unpainted. This style has become known as ‚Äúnegative boldface‚Äù or reverse-painted Aguilar pottery. They also made traditional Santo Domingo types of potty painting including black-on-cream and black-on-red. The Aguilar sisters' style of pottery ended around 1915, but is today making a comeback as the Aguilar polychrome style has been revived by one of Kewa pueblo‚Äôs leading potters, Robert Tenorio. Their pottery work, both as a family and as individual artists, can be found in various museum permanent collections including, the Brooklyn Museum, Nelson Atkins Museum of Art, Denver Art Museum, and others.

Walker was born in 1836, in British North America, in what would later become Canada.John Theakstone An Encyclopedia of Nineteenth Century Women Travellers , 2019 Her mother, Jane McNeil McMurdo, moved from Scotland to North America with her husband and infant daughter in 1836. Mrs McMurdo left her husband to live with Francis (Frank) Walker; Lucy Walker and her brother Horace were born before their parents moved to England. The McMurdos divorced in 1841, and Frank Walker and Jane McMurdo married on 24th April 1841. The family then moved to Liverpool, England, where Frank Walker became a lead merchant. Walker began her climbing rather modestly in 1858 when she was advised by her doctor to take up walking as a cure for rheumatism. Accompanied by her father Frank Walker and her brother Horace Walker, both of whom were early members of the Alpine Club, and Oberland guide Melchior Anderegg, she became the first woman to regularly climb in the Alps. Walker's achievements were, at first, largely unnoticed except by those in her immediate company. Early successes included the first ascent of the Balmhorn (1864), and the first female ascent of the Eiger (1864), Wetterhorn (1866), Lyskamm (1868) and Piz Bernina (1869). In 1871 she learned that her rival Meta Brevoort, an American female mountaineer, was planning an expedition to climb the Matterhorn. Walker hastily assembled a group and on 22 August, while wearing a white print dress, she became the first woman to stand atop the Matterhorn, and with it gained world renown. Also in that year she completed her fourth ascent of the Eiger during which she is said to have lived on a diet of sponge cake, champagne and Asti Spumante. In all Lucy Walker completed a total of 98 expeditions. In 1909 she became a member of the newly formed Ladies' Alpine Club where she was acclaimed as the pioneer of women climbers. In 1913 she was elected its second President and served in that capacity until 1915. She died at her home in Liverpool, England, on 10 September 1916.

Notable features include web browser integration, online syncing, generation of in- text citations, footnotes, and bibliographies, as well as integration with the word processors Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer, and Google Docs. It is produced by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University.  Etymology  The name \\"Zotero\\" is loosely derived from the Albanian verb zot√´roj, meaning \\"to master\\".  Features  Zotero shows an icon when a resource (book, article, thesis) is being viewed on many websites (such as library catalogs, PubMed, Google Scholar, Google Books, Amazon.com, Wikipedia, and publishers' websites). Clicking this icon saves the full reference information to the Zotero library. Zotero can also save a copy of the webpage, or, in the case of academic articles, a copy of the full text PDF. Users can then add notes, tags, attachments, and their own metadata. Items are organized through a drag-and-drop interface, and can be searched. Selections of the local reference library data can later be exported as formatted bibliographies. Furthermore, all entries including bibliographic information and user-created rich-text memos of the selected articles can be summarized into an HTML report. Zotero users can generate citations and bibliographies through word processor plugins, or directly in Zotero, using Citation Style Language styles. The house styles of most academic journals are available in Zotero, and the bibliography can be reformatted with a few clicks. Zotero also allows users to create their own customized citation styles. Zotero can import and export citations from or to many formats, including Wikipedia Citation Templates, BibTeX, BibLateX, RefWorks, MODS, COinS, Citation Style Language/JSON, refer/BibIX, RIS, TEI, several flavours of RDF, Evernote, and EndNote. Zotero can associate notes with bibliographic items. It can annotate PDFs and synchronize them with a mobile PDF reader through the Zotfile plugin. As of 2014, Zotero supports more than thirty languages. Zotero launched the online bibliography tool ZoteroBib in May 2018, where users can generate bibliographies online without installing Zotero or creating a Zotero account. Zotero has no dedicated customer support service, but the Zotero website provides extensive information, including instructional screencasts, troubleshooting tips, a list of known issues, and user forums. Questions and issues raised in the forums are answered quickly, with users and developers suggesting solutions. Many academic institutions provide Zotero tutorials to their members. Zotero uses 'translators' ‚Äì short pieces of computer code, or scripts ‚Äì written by volunteers, to understand the structure of web pages and to parse them into citations using its internal formats. These open-source scripts may be used by third party tools also, for example Wikipedia's 'Citoid' citation generator. A community-driven version of Zotero, Juris-M, allows for multilingual citations, and translations and transliterations of citation fields. It also provides additional support for needs of scholars in fields of law. Juris-M is developed by Frank Bennett, who is also one of the developers of the Citation Style Language used by Zotero. Financial support and awards Development of Zotero has been funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, as well as user donations. Zotero has won awards from PC Magazine, Northwestern University's CiteFest competition, and the American Political Science Association.  History  The first release of Zotero, 1.0.0b2.r1, was made available in October 2006 as an add-on for the Firefox web browser. Development of Zotero 1.0.x continued until May 2009, when Zotero 1.0.10 was released. In 2008, Thomson Reuters sued the Commonwealth of Virginia and George Mason University, based on the claim that Zotero's developers had, in violation of the EndNote EULA, reverse-engineered EndNote and provided Zotero with the ability to convert EndNote's proprietary .ens styles into Citation Style Language (CSL) styles. George Mason University responded that they would not renew their site license for EndNote and that \\"anything created by users of Zotero belongs to those users, and that it should be as easy as possible for Zotero users to move to and from the software as they wish, without friction\\". The journal Nature editorialized that \\"the virtues of interoperability and easy data sharing among researchers are worth restating. Imagine if Microsoft Word or Excel files could be opened and saved only in these proprietary formats, for example. It would be impossible for OpenOffice and other such software to read and save these files using open standards‚Äîas they can legally do.\\" The case was dismissed on June 4, 2009 due to a lack of jurisdiction. Although the Virginia Supreme Court granted an appeal to Thomson Reuters in this case on December 18, 2009, the appeal was withdrawn on January 11, 2011. Zotero 2.0, released in February 2010, added online features such as metadata and file syncing and group libraries, and included a license change from the Educational Community License to GPLv3. Development of Zotero 2.0.x continued until October 2010, when Zotero 2.0.9 was released. Zotero 2.1, released in March 2011, adds CSL 1.0 support, Firefox 4 compatibility (the minimum is Firefox 3.6), and Zotero Commons, through which materials can be uploaded to the Internet Archive. Zotero Standalone, first released in January 2011, allowed Zotero to be run as an independent program outside Firefox. Using XULRunner, Zotero Standalone was made available for Windows, Linux, and . Browser connectors were available to use Zotero Standalone with the web browsers Safari and Chrome. Zotero 3.0, released in January 2012, includes the stable release of Zotero Standalone as well as several new major features, including overhauled Word and LibreOffice integration and duplicate detection. Version 3.0 also introduced the Zotero bookmarklet for iOS browsers, Android browser, Chrome for Android, Firefox mobile, and Opera mobile allowing uses to save reference data to their Zotero library when using mobile devices. Zotero 4.0, released in April 2013, includes new features such as automatic journal abbreviations, direct downloading of PDFs to Zotero Standalone from the Zotero Firefox plugin, a single save button on the Zotero browser plugin (which combines the functionality of the address bar icon and the ‚ÄúCreate Web Page Item from Current Page‚Äù button), colored tags, and on-demand file syncing. Zotero 5.0, released in July 2017, did away with the Firefox plugin, replacing it with a Firefox connector for the new standalone product, which was now simply branded as the Zotero app. This move was the result of Mozilla discontinuing its powerful extension framework on which Zotero for Firefox was based. The Zotero Connectors for Chrome and Safari were also revamped, and given additional features. A point update also introduced a new PDF recognizer, using a Zotero- designed web service that doesn't rely on Google Scholar, to retrieve metadata for PDF files. In October 2018, automatic PDF file retrieval, until then limited to directly saving from original web sources, was expanded to include open-access PDF files available at Unpaywall, and integration with word processors was extended to include Google Docs through the Firefox and Chrome connectors. In June 2019, as the result of a collaboration with Retraction Watch, Zotero started flagging retracted publications in its app, and warns users who try to cite retracted articles.

Her daughter Bessie Braddock was a prominent Labour Member of Parliament (MP). Bamber was active in Liverpool and nationally for the best part of fifty years, present at key moments in Merseyside labour history, in the forefront of several prominent disputes. As a Labour councillor and a Justice of the Peace she promoted the dissemination of contraceptive advice as a mechanism to empower women. Privately educated and living in one of the most affluent parts of Edinburgh, Mary‚Äôs early life was very different from that of the poor in Liverpool she was ultimately to live among. However, when still a girl, her lawyer father took to the drink and one day walked out on the family never to be seen again. Her mother Agnes Glanders Little‚Äôs (n√©e Thomson) life up until then had been poor preparation for the rigours of single motherhood with six children to provide for. She worked hard charring and in other jobs to support her family, making a close acquaintance with near destitution and, when her eldest son got a job with a printer in Liverpool, the family came with him. The Liverpool they came to, dominated as it was by casual labour and irregularity of income, was characterised by poverty, ill health, squalid housing conditions and hand-to-mouth subsistence. During the winter of 1906-7, Mary was on the rota of women who made soup to sell at a farthing a bowl from a Clarion caravan parked by St George's Hall on Lime Street. She visited the sick, collected for the unemployed and kept open house for travelling socialists. She frequently spoke at outdoor meetings, often at the Wellington monument or on street corners. Sylvia Pankhurst described her as the \\"finest, fighting platform speaker in the country\\". In a city that was dominated by sectarianism, she refused any religious identification and was a regular heckler at both Catholic and Protestant political rallies. However, it was through her work as a trade union organiser that Bamber became most visible. In the years leading up to the First World War, she worked tirelessly as an official for the Warehouse Workers Union. She travelled the length of the dock road, organising women from Johnson's Cleaners and Dye Works in the North end to Wilson‚Äôs Bobbin Works in the South. Bamber was often up before dawn to catch bag women - who made and mended the millions of sacks used to contain and transport the products which passed through the port - as they walked to work. Like employment in rope manufacture, which also drew Mary‚Äôs attention, this was heavy, filthy, poorly paid work often undertaken by only the most desperate ‚Äì women caring for dependants, married women or those old and single. Mary gave a great deal of time - often fruitlessly in terms of actual recruitment - to talking to these women, pressing leaflets on them and persuading them to come to meetings. Bamber spoke at meetings with the Liverpool Independent Labour Party and Women's Social and Political Union organiser, Alice Morrissey attracting crowds. Though her work as a trade union organiser was central to Bamber's politics, it was interwoven with other activity. She was present at the 'Bloody Sunday' demonstration during the 1911 Liverpool general transport strike. In 1919, she stood as the Labour Party candidate in the Protestant stronghold of Everton. Campaigning on everyday issues such as milk, education and municipal laundries, she won by a tiny majority. The same year, she became a founder member of the local Communist Party and in 1920 she attended the Second Congress of the Third International in Moscow. She was a local committee member on the National Unemployed Workers Committee and, in September 1921, was one of those arrested at the occupation of the Walker Art Gallery. She did not seek a second term as city councillor and by 1924 she had left the Communist Party, saying that it interfered with her work as an organiser. She was present at all the key demonstrations held during the 1920s and into the thirties. She spoke at her last meeting just two weeks before she died.

In Hebrew, the name is rendered \\"ha-Bartseloni\\". was a Catalan Talmudist of the end of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th century. Almost nothing is known of his life. He came of a very distinguished family, on account of which he was not seldom called \\"ha-Nasi\\" (the prince), a title of honor borne also by his descendants in Barcelona. It is very doubtful if Judah was a pupil of Isaac ben Reuben, as some have asserted; nor can the names of his own pupils, and whether Abraham ben Isaac of Lunel (RABaD II) was among them, be determined. It is certain that Abraham ben Isaac knew Judah personally and consulted him in difficult cases. Judah once had a controversy with his learned fellow citizen Abraham ben ·∏§iyya. The latter, it seems, tried to postpone a wedding because the stars displayed unfavorable omens, while Judah held such a course to be contrary to law, since the regarding of omens is forbidden in the Scriptures. Works Judah was one of the greatest codifiers of the Middle Ages. With the exception of a few fragments, his halakhic writings have been lost. However, they are often cited as authoritative by Rabad II, Isaac ben Abba Mari (for both of whom he is simply \\"HaRav,\\" or \\"HaRav haMe·∏•abber\\"), Abraham ben David (RABaD III), and Zerahiah ben Isaac ha- Levi. The works of Maimonides and Jacob ben Asher,In the Jewish Encyclopedia article from which this was taken, it refers mistakenly to Judah ben Asher instead. published a century later, caused Judah's codex to be neglected, although individual scholars down to the 16th century made use of it. From quotations found in works of more than forty authors it is seen that Judah codified the whole law, ritual and civil. His Sefer haIttim, of which manuscript fragments exist,In the library of Jews' College, London (Hirschfeld, in J. Q. R. xiv. 191-192) is cited by name. The fragments contain regulations for Shabbat, but the book originally included not only regulations for the Sabbath, festivals, and Rosh Chodesh, but also nearly all the material treated of in the first part of the ·π¨ur, and probably even more than this. Part of the Sefer haIttim is printed in Coronel's Zekher Natan.pp. 129 et seq., Vienna, 1872 The part of the codex which deals with marriage laws and kindred topics is called by some Seder Nashim; by others, Yi·∏•us She'er Bosar. The civil law was contained in the Sefer ha-Dinim (so read by Halberstam instead of Sefer ha-Dayyanim), which was divided into five \\"gates,\\" and the extent of which may be judged from that portion of it published as Sefer ha- She·π≠arotS. I. Halberstam, Berlin, 1898 embracing 138 pages, and treating of the different forms of contracts according to rabbinical law. Besides this halakhic work, Judah wrote a detailed commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah. Like most commentaries on Sefer Yetzirah, that by Judah helps little to an understanding of the text; on the contrary, it contains Judah's own rather diffuse, half-mystical, half-philosophical theological discussions. The author betrays an astonishing familiarity with the Talmudic-Midrashic literature, and gives extracts from works of the Geonim which are otherwise unknown. Judah was acquainted with the philosophical writings of Saadia and of Samuel ben Hophni, but not with those of Solomon ibn Gabirol and Ba·∏•ya. He shows little talent for dealing with theological or philosophical subjects. He argues strenuously against the charge made by the Karaites that the Rabbis favored anthropomorphisms. The Sefer Yetzirah was first published by Halberstam in 1885 (Berlin). A treatise on the preparation of Torah scrollsPublished by E. Adler in J. Q. R. ix. 681-716 is attributed to Judah, but without sufficient reason. In his commentary to Sefer Yetzirah Judah mentions another of his own works, Zemanim, about which nothing further is known. To judge from certain allusions of Judah it would seem that he wrote a commentary also on the Bible; at any rate he had planned such a work. References Its bibliography: * Bacher, in J. Q.

The detective first appeared in the self-published full- sheet newspaper-sized Cole Black Comix #1 (1976) which had a print run of only 200 copies, all distributed in the Aberdeen, South Dakota area. Hartberg submitted Cole Black to Marvel Comics for inclusion in Epic Magazine in the late-1970s. Although Marvel initially like the concept and accepted the submission, changes in editorial direction at Epic Illustrated scrapped the project. In 1980, Hartberg initiated a second Cole Black series, this time in newspaper comic strip format. Between 1980 and 1983, five issues of Cole Black were published in this format. Each of these issues had national distribution and circulated between 1,000 and 1,500 copies. Informed by Bud Plant and other comics distributors that the newspaper strip format was limiting sales, Hartberg prepared African Dream in traditional comic book format. Although intended for publication in 1984 as the concluding chapter of the first story arc, African Dream was dropped in favor of a less fantastic World War II tale. The previously unpublished story was printed in a limited edition by Boardman Books (USA) prior to the sale of Hartberg's original art. Cole Black returned in volume two in traditional comic format. Although exact numbers are unknown, about 15,000 copies of volume 2, number 1, were distributed worldwide. Two more issues followed in the same format in 1985-1986. Unfortunately, Cole Black was caught in the black and white implosion of the mid-1980s when the highly speculative market for independent black and white comics crashed. Although poor sales forced Rocky Hartberg to abandon Cole Black in 1986, several full unpublished issues were already finished. Boardman Books (USA) published African Dream as Cole Black: the Missing Issue in September 2006, and in December 2006, they released Cole Black Comics (ISSN 1935-0023) volume 2, number 4, \\"Charge of the Lady Brigade,\\" cover dated Spring 2007, using art work finished in 1986.

United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court concerning the constitutionality of the United States Sentencing Commission. Background John Mistretta was indicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri for allegedly selling cocaine. He moved to have the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which had been established under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, declared unconstitutional because it delegated excessive authority by Congress, resulting in a violation of separation of powers. After the motion was denied, Mistretta pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and agreement to sell cocaine. He was sentenced principally to serve 18 months in prison. He filed an appeal to the Eighth Circuit, but he and the government both petitioned for certiorari before judgment, and the Supreme Court granted the petitions. Issues presented Was Congress's creation of a United States Sentencing Commission with the power to establish binding sentencing guidelines a constitutional delegation of authority? Decision The Supreme Court held that the Commission and the guidelines represented a constitutional delegation of powers. Justice Blackmun delivered the majority opinion. The Court held that, as society increases in complexity, Congress must delegate authority ‚Äúunder broad general directives.\\" The broad delegation of power to the Commission was undoubtedly \\"sufficiently specific and detailed to meet constitutional requirements.‚Äù Congress charged the commission with specific goals, identified specific purposes that sentencing was to serve, and prescribed a particular tool in the guidelines. That and other guidance that Congress provided ensured that the commission was steered by \\"more than merely an 'intelligible principle' or minimal standards.\\" Turning to the separation of powers question, the Supreme Court considered Mistretta's objections to the location of the commission inside the judicial branch, the composition of the commission and the president's ability to appoint and remove members of the commission but found none of these meritorious. Dissent Dissenting, Justice Scalia believed the commission to be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power by Congress to another branch because the guidelines established by the Sentencing Commission have the force of law: a judge who disregards them will be reversed. Justice Scalia noted that the guidelines were \\"heavily laden (or ought to be) with value judgments and policy assessments\\" rather than being merely technical. He also disputed the assertion by the Court's majority that the Sentencing Commission was in the judicial branch rather than the legislative branch, writing that the Commission \\"is not a court, does not exercise judicial power, and is not controlled by or accountable to members of the Judicial Branch.\\" Justice Scalia rejected the notion of an ‚Äúindependent agency‚Äù in the judicial branch because ‚Äúunlike executive power, judicial and legislative powers have never been thought delegable. A judge may not leave the decision to his law clerk [and] Senators... may not send delegates to consider and vote upon bills in their place.‚Äù The case, he asserted, was not about ‚Äúcommingling‚Äù of constitutional powers ‚Äúbut about the creation of a new Branch altogether, a sort of junior varsity Congress.‚Äù See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 488 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court * United States v.

When they first started, Arthur and Hilda would make pots while Robert would create decorative designs and do the painting. Within two years time, Arthur was painting pots for himself and his wife Hilda. They eventually became full-time potters, winning numerous awards at the Santa Fe Indian Markets between 1983-1998. They participated in exhibitions at the Santa Fe Indian Market and the Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Arts & Crafts Shows. The Coriz' couple made pottery using the traditional methods of Santo Domingo potters. They used only natural clays and the Rocky Mountain bee plant, also known as wild spinach, and honey for making the black paint. Together they made traditional polychrome jars, bowls, dough bowls, and canteens. Arthur and Hilda‚Äôs favorite designs included birds, clouds, flowers and animals like the deer and bighorn sheep.

The rise of Hellenism and the Roman Republic are generally seen as signalling the end of the Iron Age in the Mediterranean. Roman iron-working was enhanced by a process known as carburization. The Romans used the better properties in their armaments, and the 1,300 years of Roman military technology saw radical changes. The Roman armies of the early empire were much better equipped than early republican armies. Metals used for arms and armor primarily included iron, bronze, and brass. For construction, the army used wood, earth, and stone. The later use of concrete in architecture was widely mirrored in Roman military technology, especially in the application of a military workforce to civilian construction projects.John W. Humphrey, John P. Oleson and Andrew N. Sherwood; Greek and Roman Technology: A sourcebook Origins and development Much of what is described as typically Roman technology, as opposed to that of the Greeks, comes directly from the Etruscan civilization, which was thriving to the North when Rome was just a small kingdom. The Etruscans had invented the stone arch, and used it in bridges as well as buildings. Some later Roman technologies were taken directly from Greek civilization. After the absorption of the ancient Greek city states into the Roman Republic in 146 BC, the highly advanced Greek technology began to spread across many areas of Roman influence and supplement the Empire. This included the military advances that the Greeks had made, as well as all the scientific, mathematical, political and artistic developments. =New materials= However, the Romans made many significant technological advances, such as the invention of hydraulic cement and concrete. They used such new materials to great advantage in their structures, many of which survive to this day, like their masonry aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard, and buildings, such as the Pantheon and Baths of Diocletian in Rome. Their methods were recorded by such luminaries as Vitruvius and Frontinus for example, who wrote handbooks to advise fellow engineers and architects. Romans knew enough history to be aware that widespread technological change had occurred in the past and brought benefits, as shown for example by Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia. That tradition continued as the empire grew in size and absorbed new ideas. Romans thought of themselves as practical, so small-scale innovation was common (such as the development of the ballista into the polybolos or repeating ballista). The traditional view is that their reliance on a plentiful slave labour force and a lack of a patent or copyright system have both been cited as reasons that there was little social or financial pressure to automate or reduce manual tasks. However, this view is being challenged by new research that shows they did indeed innovate, and on a wide scale. Thus the watermill had been known to the Greeks, but it was the Romans who developed their efficient utilisation. The set of mills at Barbegal in southern France were worked by a single aqueduct, which drove no fewer than 16 overshot mills built into the side of a hill. They probably were built by the army and supplied flour to a wide region. Floating mills were also used to exploit fast flowing rivers. Pont du Gard =Mining= The Romans also used water power in an unexpected way during mining operations. It's known from the writings of Pliny the Elder that they exploited the alluvial gold deposits of north-west Spain soon after the conquest of the region in 25 BC using large-scale hydraulic mining methods. The spectacular gold mine at Las Medulas was worked by no fewer than seven long aqueducts cut into the surrounding mountains, the water being played directly onto the soft auriferous ore. The outflow was channelled into sluice boxes, and the heavier gold collected on rough pavements. They also developed many deep mines, such as those for copper at Rio Tinto, where Victorian mining developments exposed the much earlier workings. Dewatering machines, such as Archimedean screws and reverse overshot water wheels, were found in situ, one of which is on show at the British Museum. Another fragmentary example was recovered from the Roman gold mine at Dolaucothi in west Wales, and is preserved at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff. The army were at the forefront of development of gold mines, since the metal was imperial property, and developed the Dolaucothi mines from the outset by establishing a fort there that was known as Luentinum. They had the expertise to build the infrastructure of aqueducts and reservoirs, as well as control production. Panoramic view of Las M√©dulas The period in which technological progress was fastest and greatest was during the 2nd century and 1st century BC, which was the period in which Roman political and economic power greatly increased. By the 2nd century, Roman technology appears to have peaked. Roman implementation of technology The Romans advanced military technology significantly, and implemented it on a massive scale. From a few early models of ballista from Greek city-states the Romans adopted and improved the design, eventually issuing one to every century in the legions. To facilitate this organization, an engineering corps was developed. An officer of engineers, or praefectus fabrum, is referenced in armies of the Late Republic, but this post is not verifiable in all accounts and may have simply been a military advisor on the personal staff of a commanding officer.Keppie 1984: 99 There were legion architects (whose rank is yet unknown), who were responsible for the construction of war machines.

In the Roman kingdom the social standing of a person impacted both his political and military roles, which were often organised into familial clans such as the Julia. These clans often wielded a large amount of power and were huge influences through the Roman Kingdom into the Republic. The political system was from an early date based upon competition within the ruling elite, the Patricians. Senators in the Republic competed fiercely for public office, the most coveted of which was the post of Consul. Two were elected each year to head the government of the state, and would be assigned a consular army and an area in which to campaign. From Gaius Marius and Sulla onwards, control of the army began to be tied into the political ambitions of individuals, leading to the first triumvirate of the 1st century BC and the resulting Caesar‚Äôs civil war. The late Republic and Empire was increasingly plagued by usurpations led by or supported by the military, leading to the crisis of the third century in the late empire. Roman kingdom  Under the Etruscan king Servius Tullius, a person's social standing and wealth determined both their political and military role: following his reforms, a rich man would have had greater voting rights, and greater standing within the military, than a poor man. A further politicization of the military involved officers for a unit not belonging to and being drawn from the class of the military unit he commanded but being selected often through voting. Roman Republic  In the republic, the tradition of social class determining military duty continued, despite structural changes - the rich equestrians continued to serve together in the equites for instance - but the lower ranks became less politicized and based upon a mix of social class, age and military experience rather than social class alone. For non-citizens, 25 years in the army was a guaranteed way of gaining citizenship for them and their family. Despite these changes on the bottom rungs of the military, amongst the army's commanders a process began of politicizing military command. In the Republic, military service made a person of the equestrian class eligible for a wide range of profitable postings: military triumphs boosted a person's career, and military service became a pre-requirement for a number of political posts. Intended initially to ensure that all political leaders had shown dedication and duty serving in the military, the effect was to cause military experience to become of paramount importance to a Roman's political career, with the eventual consequence that armies would become tools for the political goals of their generals, rather than neutrally aligned forces of the state. At the highest level, two consuls were elected each year to head the government of the state and simultaneously were appointed the commanders-in-chief of the Roman army, and would be assigned a consular army and an area in which to campaign. From late Republic to mid-Roman Empire  In 100 BC, Lucius Appuleius Saturninus was tribune and advocated several social reforms, among which was a bill that gave colonial lands to war veterans, a suggestion that was radical and displeasing to the patrician senate, which opposed the measures. Violence broke out and the Senate ordered Gaius Marius, as Consul for that year, to put down the revolt. Marius, although he was generally allied with the radicals, complied with the request and put down the revolt in the interest of public order. The political issue of land allocation for Rome's military veterans would return several times to haunt the state including 14 AD when an army in central Europe mutinied over the failure of the state to provide land plots for soldiers. After the conclusion of the Social War, certain of Rome's eastern provinces became under threat of invasion and it was necessary to raise an army to counter the threat. The choice before the Senate was to put either Consul Marius or Consul Sulla in command of an army. There was already a fierce rivalry between the two, in part due to a competitive instinct amongst the two as successful generals, but more importantly distrust on Sulla's part that Marius held unhealthy ambitions. The Roman Republic was always on guard against any citizen gaining too much prominence, lest he seize power and restore Rome as a kingdom; thus a series of checks and balances existed, such as consuls having to be re-elected annually. Marius had already served five consulships and enjoyed widespread popularity. The senate made its decision and Sulla was given the job but a short time later the decision was reversed by the Assembly, and Marius placed in command. Already wary of Marius' prominence and previous five terms as consul, and (rightly) suspecting bribery in the securing of the position to command the army (Marius had promised to erase the debts of Publius Sulpicius Rufus), Sulla refused to acknowledge the validity of the Assembly's action. Sulla left Rome and traveled to reach the army waiting in Nola, the army the Senate had asked him to lead against Mithridates. Sulla urged his legions to defy the Assembly's orders and accept him as their rightful leader. Sulla was successful and the legions stoned the representatives from the Assembly when they arrived, defying the state's orders. Sulla then commanded six legions to march with him to Rome. This was a momentous event, and was unforeseen by Marius, as no Roman army had ever marched upon Rome - it was forbidden by law and ancient tradition. Marius fled with no great loss of life and Sulla later disbanded his legions and re- established consular government, but the military had been shown to be able to be used as a political tool of individuals. It was a pattern to be repeated more famously later by Caesar. During the First Triumvirate of Julius Caesar, Pompey and Crassus, each of the triumvires used military success to enhance their own political and public status. The incredibly wealthy consul Crassus, who had earlier displayed his wealth by entertaining the populace of Rome at a huge party with 10,000 tables, personally raised and funded six legions from his personal wealth. Whilst he did not at this time use them for marching on Rome in direct furtherance of his own career, his desperation to rival the military campaigns of Pompey that led to recognition in the public eye means that his motives are unlikely to have been entirely selfless. Rather, it was another step in the severance of the direct connection between state and troops that saw armies increasingly become tied to their generals' political careers. When the triumvirate collapsed, Caesar crossed the Rubicon river and marched his armies upon Rome itself. This turning of an army loyal to its general against the state had occurred before under Sulla, but the circumstances were different this time: Sulla felt at least partly justified in his march on Rome by the alleged and probably real corruption of the political system by Marius, and by Marius' own quest for primacy as a political figure against a political backdrop that sought to prevent any person becoming too prominent. Caesar, on the other hand, marched his army against Rome purely for his own purposes. It is true that the political maneuverings of Pompey, which made it possible for Caesar to be prosecuted on his return to Rome, pushed Caesar into marching on Rome, but the fact that almost the entire senate fled alongside Pompey shows that Caesar's actions were at least perceived to be an act against the state itself rather than the person of Pompey: Caesar's power base was built almost exclusively on the loyalty of the soldiers who had served under him campaigning several years. Unlike Sulla, Caesar also failed to revert power to the state when the threat of Pompey had been removed, not just keeping his position as de facto ruler of the state but, immediately on his return from defeating Pompey, naming his grand-nephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian) as the heir to his title, a wholly unconstitutional act. In everything but name, the army had placed the first Emperor on the throne of Rome. The years following the fall of the republic were peaceful and relatively benign with the military not involving itself greatly in political affairs - such that the term Pax Augusti is often used - perhaps because the military was expending most of its energy in territorial expansion of the empire. The Roman senate and emperors were not blind to the possibility of rebellion by its troops as generals could gain the loyalty of his officers through a mixture of personal charisma, promises and simple bribes: once the general and officers had a unity of purpose the rigid discipline of the military meant that the troops would normally follow. Only later seemingly did the situation reverse and the soldiers began to dictate action to the officers and generals, raising generals to Emperors even when the generals themselves were completely lacking such ambition or wishes. However, the state saw itself as relatively safe from such rebellions in the early imperial period. The reason for this safety from rebellion is that for a rebellion to be successful it was necessary for an usurper to gain control of a certain percentage of the army in order to stand some chance of success. Sulla and Caesar had managed such actions because the consular system of that period had concentrated in their hands a large proportion of the small number of armies in service of the state at the time. In the expanding empire, legions under generals were spread out across the extent of the Roman borders and it was not easy for one man to seize control of a great part of them, perhaps only commonly being in control of two or so legions. However, later larger-scale wars necessitated the concentration of greater military power in the hands of generals. There is evidence of emperors holding some members of generals' families as hostage to ensure their loyalty. Middle Roman Empire  By the mid Empire the military's involvement in politics had increased to the degree such that 193 AD saw no less than five emperors as armies heralded their generals as emperors or even, as after the death of Pertinax, murdered the Emperor and then sold the empire at auction to the highest bidder. Likewise, from 211 to the accession of Diocletian and the establishment of the Tetrarchy in 293, Rome saw 28 emperors of which only two had a natural death (from the plague). However, there were also 38 usurpers who raised revolts across the empire. Successful usurpers were usually either provincial governors, commanders of a large grouping of Roman legions, or prefects of the Praetorian guard, which had control of Rome, where the Imperial palace still lay. The problem of usurpation seems to have lain at least partially in the lack of a clear tradition enshrined in law and popular will of an agreed method of ensuring succession, and also in the maintenance of large standing armies. The former problem was evident from the very first emperor Augustus and meant that those claiming imperial power via various means, and whether they went on to become emperor or be denounced as usurpers, could all claim some form of legitimacy. The latter problem meant that there were always men remote from their duties and loyalties in Rome and in command or large armies marching under their discipline and command. The usurpation mania of the 3rd century had profound effects in the military organization of the Empire. One of the most striking changes was the division and multiplication of the Roman provinces. The greater the manpower a provincial governor had under his command, the greater the temptation to make a bid to the throne. Thus, provinces were slowly divided into smaller units to avoid concentration of power and military capacity in the hands of one man. Late Roman Empire The beginning of the end of the Roman Empire did not start in a way that foreshadowed the downfall of a great power. The latter part of the Roman reign began when Diocletian (r. 284-305 AD) emerged. Diocletian was a strong and able leader but by creating smaller provinces, he effectively split the empire into two parts - East and West. The maintenance of legions in a \\"strategic reserve\\" some distance behind the frontier and close to the emperors must also have been partially attributable to a need to preserve against rebellion by Roman border armies as much as against external invasion by an enemy. He also established the tetrarchy in 293 AD by appointing Maximian, who played the role of a co-emperor, as well as Galerius and Constantius Chlorus, who were subordinate but powerful nonetheless. Constantius' son Constantine would reunite the halves 31 years later and founded a new capital at Constantinople in 330 AD. Ultimately, the Empire itself was destroyed because of the eventual loyalty of its troops to their commanders over their state. In 476, Odoacer was appointed leader of the foederati troops of Rome, and deposed the emperor, proclaiming himself King of Italy. Political economy of the Roman military There is evidence that starvation among Roman troops could induce them to mutiny. These mutinies, in turn, could then lead to political instability, including the assassination of the emperor himself.

It is part of the National Sanctuary of Ancient Chernihiv and is an Archaeological Monument of national importance. Comparable to the barrows of Gnyozdovo near Smolensk, the Black Grave has a height of over 10 metres and a circumference of 170 metres. During excavations undertaken in 1872‚Äì73, Dmitry Samokvasov uncovered two cremated bodies of Norse warriors (probably father and son), surrounded by slaves, sacrificial animals, arms, armour, and decorations. Samokvasov dated the burial to the late 10th century, when Vladimir I was the ruler of Kievan Rus. It is likely that the buried warriors were two princes (knyazes) of Chernihiv, although no local potentate is attested in the Slavonic chronicles before Vladimir's son, Mstislav of Chernihiv. After the bodies were cremated, they were put upon a 7-metre-high mound, where a funeral feast took place. Arranged near the bodies were two helmets and knee-length chain mail (hauberks), probably extracted from the pyre, as well as a cauldron with ram bones, two sacerdotal knives, two golden Byzantine coins, an imported sabre, a miniature dark-red bronze idol of Thor, and two silver-bound aurochs horns decorated with floral motifs, fabulous animals, and figures of a man and a woman shooting at a bird. When the barrow was completed, a stele was placed at the top. All these items are now displayed at the State Historical Museum in Moscow. At the present time the site of the burial mound along with other 34 buildings (mostly churches) are included in the Chernihiv National Architecture-Historical Sanctuary \\"Ancient Chernihiv\\". The Black Grave along with the rest of the reserve is the major tourist attraction in the Chernihiv Oblast (province) of Ukraine.

It is endemic to the Seychelles. At one time thought to be extinct, it was rediscovered and is now listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. Description This long bird has a plumage of olive-grey upperparts and dull-coloured underparts. It is further characterized by a narrow, white eye-ring, a rather long dark-grey tail and a small sharp bill. Its diet consists of insect larvae, locusts, and grasshoppers as well as berries and seeds. The Seychelles white-eye's breeding season is from September to April, in which a clutch of two to seven eggs is laid into a cup-shaped nest. The incubation time is thirteen to fifteen days and the young are fully fledged after eleven to sixteen days. After that, adults look after their young for another two months. The species' melodious and complex song consists of nasal tones. Due to its ecology and foraging habits (in the canopy of high trees) it is difficult to observe. The existence of an amazingly complex cooperative breeding system was discovered among Seychelles white-eyes. It is apparently unique among all species of white-eyes and appears as a very peculiar social breeding organisation among birds in general. Within the same breeding territory, the individual composition of nesting groups constantly changes, often involving birds that sometimes also contribute to nests in other territories. Threats Zosterops modestus was thought to be extinct between 1935 and 1960 until it was rediscovered in the highlands of Mah√©. Even in 1996 it was considered one of the rarest birds in the world, with a population of only 25-35 individuals. The dramatic decline in population was caused by the extensive clearing of forests, competition with introduced birds (especially with the common myna), and from rat predation. In 1997, a population of about 250 individuals was rediscovered on the island of Conception. In 1998, the population on Mah√© was estimated to be about 50. Currently the population on Conception Island consists of between 244 and 336 individuals. In 2001, the Island Conservation Society led a project to transfer 31 birds to the Seychelles island of Fr√©gate. The population has since increased to more than 60 birds. Further transfers of birds have been made to North Island, Seychelles and to Cousine Island. Birds subsequently died out on Cousine, but transfers to other islands have been successful, increasing the world population to perhaps 500.

Route Description =Columbiana County= Ohio State Route 39 has an eastern terminus at the West Virginia state line near East Liverpool, Ohio. It then continues as a two-laned road through residential areas of East Liverpool. It widens into a four lane road just east of the interchange with US 30, and proceeds northwest as a freeway around downtown East Liverpool.https://www.google.com/maps/place/OH-39,+East+Liverpool,+OH/@40.6164321,-80.5953539,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x883723a05cb175d9:0xce830cbd87bfe7e!8m2!3d40.6164008!4d-80.5778443 History SR 39 was commissioned in 1923, originally routed from Shelby to Dover. In 1927 the highway was extended to the current eastern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line, along mostly the former route of SR 20. The route was extended to its current northern terminus at SR 103, in 1939. Between 1969 and 1971 the road between Shelby and Mansfield became a four-lane highway. In 1974, the route between Wellsville and East Liverpool was upgraded to a four- lane highway.

Airlanding units included infantry battalions and light armoured regiments together with combat support and combat service support units and sub-units. The Glider Pilot Regiment provided the aircrew to fly the gliders into battle (who were trained to fight alongside them on the ground thereafter). Although combat support and combat service support units had the term airlanding as part of their unit title, for example 1st Airlanding Light Regiment Royal Artillery, infantry battalions' names remained unchanged. All units wore the maroon beret of airborne forces with their own regimental capbadge. Development The 1st and 6th Airlanding Brigades formed integral parts of the 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions. Paratroopers tended to become scattered over a wide area on landing. This meant they took some time to compose a useful force, once on the ground. Although gliders needed a certain amount of ground to land, the soldiers aboard arrived in larger groups (the Horsa glider carried a complete platoon) and ready for combat. The British Army had been inspired in creating both glider-borne units and parachute units by the example of the German Luftwaffe's Glider Troops which had played a major role in Germany's invasions of the Low Countries, and Crete. History bridge over the Caen Canal, at B√©nouville, are visible beyond the bridge, in June, 1944. The bridge was renamed Pegasus Bridge after the mythical winged horse on the formation sign of British airborne forces. Probably the most famous action involving a glider-borne unit was that at Pegasus Bridge, the first landing of troops on D Day, as part of Operation Deadstick. On the night of 5/6 June 1944, D Company, 2nd Battalion Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (2nd Ox & Bucks), led by Major John Howard, together with Royal Engineers and men of the Glider Pilot Regiment (totalling 181 men), were carried in 6 Horsa gliders to capture the vital bridge (later renamed \\"Pegasus Bridge\\") over the Caen Canal, and the bridge over the Orne River (since known as Horsa Bridge, and which is east of Pegasus Bridge). This was intended to secure the eastern flank to prevent German armour from reaching the area behind Sword Beach and interfering with the beach landings of the 3rd Infantry Division there. Five of the Ox and Bucks's gliders landed very close to their objectives at 16 minutes past midnight and poured out of their battered gliders, surprising the German defenders, and taking the bridges within 10 minutes. They lost two men, Lieutenant Den Brotheridge and Lance-Corporal Greenhalgh. One glider, assigned to the capture of Horsa Bridge, was landed at the bridge over the Rives Dives, some 7 miles from where they were meant to land. The soldiers captured the bridge, then moved through German lines towards the village of Ranville, where they eventually rejoined the British forces. The Ox & Bucks were reinforced half-an-hour after the landings by 7th Parachute Battalion, and linked up with the beach landing forces with the arrival of the British Commandos of the 1st Commando Brigade under the command of Brigadier Lord Lovat.

He was a judge in the Denia community, where he became connected with ibn Al·∏•atosh, likely due to becoming his son-in-law. Among his later descendants was Moses ben Na·∏•man (Na·∏•manides); Judah Albargeloni is said to have been Isaac's pupil. He was one of five prominent contemporaneous scholars named Isaac and the regard in which he was held by his own and succeeding generations is indicated by the fact that he is simply designated \\"Ha-Rab Albargeloni.\\" He wrote commentaries on various sections of the tractate Ketubot, and at the age of thirty-five (1078) translated, from the Arabic into Hebrew, Hai Gaon's Ha-Mi·∏≥·∏≥a·∏• weha-Mimkar, on buying and selling (Venice, 1602, and frequently afterward printed with commentaries). Noteworthy among his liturgical poems are his Azharot, included in the rituals of Constantine, Tlem√ßen, Tunis, Morocco, Algeria, and Oran. There are 145 strophes in the poem, each consisting of three verses, and it ends with a Biblical quotation. Contemporaries said that Isaac's use of Biblical verses indicates great skill. Al-·∏§arizi remarked: \\"He has put the religious laws into rime, and has fitted them so well to Biblical passages that it almost seems as if the work had been inspired by a higher power.\\" Isaac faithfully copied the division of the laws and interdictions of the Halakot Gedolot; at times even following its wording, while he also took into account the regulations of traditional literature referring to Biblical prescriptions. The following poems of Isaac are also included in the Azharot: * Alah Mosheh le-Rosh Har Sinai (introduction) * Yom Zeh Horid (pizmon preceding the commands) * Ya·∏•id Nora 'Alilah (pizmon between the commands and interdictions) Isaac also wrote Pa·∏•adti mi-Yo·∫ìeri and Yom Zeh Mekapper le- Shabim, both in three-line strophes, the latter with signature and alphabet. Rapoport also attributes to Isaac the works Ayumati Yonah, ahabah for the Sabbath before the Feast of Weeks, and Ya·∏≥ush be-'Onyo, ge'ullah for the fifth Sabbath after Pesa·∏•, but other scholars dispute whether these works were created by Isaac.

Thus, there have been multiple uses of the same names, confusingly sometimes sharing a common pennant number. The role of support tanker generally involves the bulk transport of fuel oils between distribution centres, the replenishment of front-line fleet tankers such as the and classes and using their replenishment at sea (RAS) abilities to allow them to directly support naval warships.

Dirr, Professor of Horticulture at the University of Georgia criticized the tree's form as 'floppy'. The bark features greyish, flat-topped ridges, separated by roughly diamond-shaped fissures. The dark green leaves are large, < 17 cm (avg. 12 cm) long by < 10 cm (avg. 7.4 cm) broad, typical of the species, turning golden yellow in autumn. In an assessment at U C Davis as part of the National Elm Trial, the tree initially grew comparatively slowly, increasing in height by 0.85 m per annum, although stem development at 2.6 cm d.b.h. was near average.McPherson, G. et al. (2008). National elm trial: Initial report from Northern California. Western Arborist, Fall 2009, 32-36. Image: Valley Forge leaf and Euro coin.jpgLeaf with 1 Euro coin Image: Valley forge autumn colour 2.jpgFall color Pests and diseases 'Valley Forge' has proven the most resistant of all the American Elm cultivars (although it is not immune) to Dutch elm disease. While also very resistant to the elm leaf beetle, Xanthogaleruca luteola like all other American Elms it is susceptible to Elm Yellows.Townsend, A. M., Bentz, S. E., and Douglass L. W. (2005). Evaluation of 19 American Elm Clones for Tolerance to Dutch Elm Disease . Journal of Environmental Horticulture, March 2005, Horticultural Research Institute, Washington, D.C. In California 'Valley Forge' has also been found to be susceptible to leaf curling aphids (Eriosoma sp.) which produce honeydew The cultivar is only moderately preferred for feeding by the Japanese Beetle Popillia japonica,Brady, C., Condra, J., & Potter, D.

University of Kentucky. but the species as a whole is the most susceptible of all the elms to verticillium wilt.Pegg, G. F. & Brady, B. L. (2002). Verticillium Wilts. CABI Publishing. In England, the leaves of 'Valley Forge,' along with those of other American Elm cultivars, remained completely free from Black Spot.Brookes, A. H. (2020). Great Fontley Elm Trial, 2020 Report. Butterfly Conservation, Lulworth, England. Cultivation All examples included in 10-year trials at Atherton, California, to evaluate replacements for Californian elms lost to disease were withdrawn after a combination of rapid growth and poor structure condemned the trees as \\"likely to require more maintenance than most municipalities would find acceptable\\".Costello, L. R. (2004). A 10-year evaluation of the performance of four elm cultivars in California, U. S. Journal of Arboriculture, March 2004. However, these verdicts may reflect in large measure the fact that they were grown in warm climates but with minimal weed competition. Trees raised in the nursery of the University of Minnesota also proved very difficult to manage, but \\"settled down\\" as they matured, adopting a more manageable form and habit.Giblin, C. P. & Gillman, J. H. (2006). Elms for the Twin Cities: A Guide for Selection and Maintenance. University of Minnesota. 'Valley Forge' seems to develop far fewer structural problems in temperate climates further north, where the rate of growth in any given season is much more moderate. Moreover, where grown in the countryside, competing vegetation tends to keep excessively vigorous growth in check . Interim results from the aforementioned trial at U C Davis confirm the tree's high pruning requirement. 'Valley Forge' was introduced to the UK in 2010;; it is not known to have been introduced to Australasia. Etymology 'Valley Forge' was named for the site near Philadelphia where Washington's forces endured the winter of 1777 during the War of Independence. Accessions ;North America *Arnold Arboretum, US.

He was sent to Colombia as part of an exchange program between the two countries to help found the National Police of Colombia on 5 November 1891 and was its first commissioner. Early life Gilibert was born in Fustignac in the French department of Haute Garonne on 24 February 1839. He joined the French army at the age of 22 and rose to become a Sergeant-Major. Gilibert served during the Franco-Prussian War and was wounded at the battle of Reichshoffen. During the war he was captured three times, escaping each time. He was awarded the French military medal for his service. After the war, Gilibert travelled with his regiment to Constantinople, where he was appointed a police commissioner of the 5th class. He later rose to become the commissioner of the 1st class in Lille. Colombia At the request of the Colombian charg√© d'affaires, Gonzalo Mallarino, Gilibert was selected to reorganise the Bogota police, known as the National Police, based on his knowledge of Spanish and his experience, and arrived in the country in late 1891. On 1 January 1892 he presented the new Bogota police service, consisting of 450 officers organised in six districts, to President Carlos Holguin and his ministers in a parade. Local press reports from this period describe him rarely leaving his offices and strictly enforcing discipline, including dismissing two officers who claimed to have seen a ghost. Gilibert's contract expired in August 1892 but he remained on as an instructor to the force. Between 15 and 17 January 1893 a series of riots by artisans and craftsmen known as the \\"Bogotazo\\" erupted in Bogota. Anger towards the police force caused by its professionalisation and its crackdown on street crime and prostitution, as well as Gilibert's alienation from the local populace and recruitment of officers from outside the city is thought to have contributed to the breakout of rioting. Under Gilibert's leadership, the police responded violently, with many arrests. In 1894 Gilibert also had a role in uncovering a coup-plot by artisans, buying off one of the plotters with 200 pesos. He also had a role in uncovering a liberal coup plot against the governing conservatives in Bogota in January 1895, though this did not prevent a series of liberal uprisings timed to occur simultaneously elsewhere resulting in a civil war in that year. In 1898 Gilibert tended his resignation from the directorate of the Bogota police, claiming that his resources were insufficient for his task. He later reassumed the directorate under the government of General Rafael Reyes and continued to serve as an advisor until his death on 11 September 1923.

In the early 20th century, Lama joined the U.S. Cavalry as a cobbler for the soldiers stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas. After completing his service in 1911, he stayed in the border town of El Paso, Texas. While there, Lama met and married Esther Hernandez, a pianist and music teacher. Soon after, he opened a small shoe and boot repair shop. Repairs were initially the biggest part of his business, but the boots he made soon became popular. In the first year, together with his one employee at the time, Lama sold 20 pairs of handcrafted boots.Tony Lama - History By the 1930s, Western wear stores began asking for Tony Lama's boots. In response, he developed methods to produce greater quantities. Over the next two decades, Lama's six children became actively involved in the business. In 1946, his son, Joseph ‚ÄúBert‚Äù Lama, presented a custom pair of gold and silver inlaid boots to U.S. President Harry S. Truman. In the 1950s, the company began marketing its boots nationally.

He had a life-long commitment to life-long learning and promoting civic values and educational reforms. Silva Alvarenga edited one of the first newspapers in Brazil, O Patriota.  Biography  Silva Alvarenga was born out of wedlock in Ouro Preto and was biracial. His mother was African and his father an \\"indigent white musician.\\" He was raised in Minas Geras. In the early 1770s, he studied in Rio de Janeiro. Silva Alvarenga was able to attend the University of Coimbra in Portugal in 1776 where he studied law. His father's friends encouraged his poetry and musical talents. After studying in Portugal, he moved back to Brazil, where he was part of the Ouro Preto Arcady. In 1782, he moved to Rio de Janeiro where he taught rhetoric and poetics in the position of Royal Professor. He became a founding member of the Sociedade Literaria do Rio de Janeiro (Literary Society in Rio de Janeiro) in 1786. The society discussed issues ranging from the French Revolution to religion, where some members challenged religious dogma and claimed that miracles did not exist. Because the society was considered \\"subversive\\" he was imprisoned from 1794 to 1797. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 1814. Poetry Silva Alvarenga's poetry follows European Neoclassical aesthetics of the eighteenth century and is considered an Arcadian poet. His work is compared to Tomas Antonio Gonzaga and Claudio Manuel da Costa. Silva Alvarenga, along with other Brazilian Arcadians, have been credited with planting \\"the roots of a literary culture in a systematic sense\\" in Brazil. He was unique among contemporary Brazilian poets in using Brazil's own natural landscape in his work. He rarely included Africans in his own poetry and when he did, his depictions were considered negative by today's standards. Despite his personal background as a person of color, Silva Alvarenga, like many in his time, believed that black people were not \\"suitable subjects for poetry.\\" O Desetor das Letras is a satire based on university reforms of 1772. His series of work, Glaura: poemas eroticos was originally published in Lisbon.

The massacre was initiated in NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria's proposal to Stalin to execute all captive members of the Polish officer corps, approved by the Soviet Politburo led by Joseph Stalin. Of the total killed, about 8,000 were officers imprisoned during the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland, another 6,000 were police officers, and the remaining 8,000 were Polish intelligentsia the Soviets deemed to be \\"intelligence agents, gendarmes, landowners, saboteurs, factory owners, lawyers, officials, and priests\\". The Polish Army officer class was representative of the multi-ethnic Polish state; the murdered included ethnic Poles, Polish Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Polish Jews including the Chief Rabbi of the Polish Army, Baruch Steinberg. The government of Nazi Germany announced the discovery of mass graves in the Katyn Forest in April 1943. Stalin severed diplomatic relations with the London-based Polish government-in-exile when it asked for an investigation by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The USSR claimed the Nazis had killed the victims, and it continued to deny responsibility for the massacres until 1990, when it officially acknowledged and condemned the killings by the NKVD, as well as the subsequent cover-up by the Soviet government. An investigation conducted by the office of the Prosecutors General of the Soviet Union (1990‚Äì1991) and the Russian Federation (1991‚Äì2004) confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres, but refused to classify this action as a war crime or as an act of mass murder. The investigation was closed on the grounds the perpetrators were dead, and since the Russian government would not classify the dead as victims of the Great Purge, formal posthumous rehabilitation was deemed inapplicable. In November 2010, the Russian State Duma approved a declaration blaming Stalin and other Soviet officials for ordering the massacre.  Background  =Invasion of Poland= Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov signs the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. Behind him: Ribbentrop and Stalin. On 1 September 1939, the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany began. Consequently, Britain and France, fulfilling the Anglo-Polish and Franco-Polish treaties of alliance, and most countries of the British Empire declared war on Germany, but provided little military support to Poland. They took minimal military action during what became known as the Phoney War. The Soviet invasion of Poland began on 17 September, in accordance with the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. The Red Army advanced quickly and met little resistance, as Polish forces facing them were under orders not to engage the Soviets. About 250,000 to 454,700 Polish soldiers and policemen were captured and interned by the Soviet authorities. Some were freed or escaped quickly, but 125,000 were imprisoned in camps run by the NKVD. Of these, 42,400 soldiers, mostly of Ukrainian and Belarusian ethnicity serving in the Polish Army, who lived in the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, were released in October. The 43,000 soldiers born in western Poland, then under Nazi control, were transferred to the Germans; in turn, the Soviets received 13,575 Polish prisoners from the Germans. =Polish prisoners of war= Soviet repressions of Polish citizens occurred as well over this period. Since Poland's conscription system required every nonexempt university graduate to become a military reserve officer, the NKVD was able to round up a significant portion of the Polish educated class as prisoners of war. According to estimates by the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), roughly 320,000 Polish citizens were deported to the Soviet Union (this figure is questioned by some other historians, who hold to older estimates of about 700,000‚Äì1,000,000). IPN estimates the number of Polish citizens who died under Soviet rule during World War II at 150,000 (a revision of older estimates of up to 500,000). Of the group of 12,000 Poles sent to Dalstroy camp (near Kolyma) in 1940‚Äì1941, mostly POWs, only 583 men survived; they were released in 1942 to join the Polish Armed Forces in the East. According to Tadeusz Piotrowski, \\"during the war and after 1944, 570,387 Polish citizens had been subjected to some form of Soviet political repression\\". As early as 19 September, the head of the NKVD, Lavrentiy Beria, ordered the secret police to create the Main Administration for Affairs of Prisoners of War and Internees to manage Polish prisoners. The NKVD took custody of Polish prisoners from the Red Army, and proceeded to organise a network of reception centres and transit camps, and to arrange rail transport to prisoner-of-war camps in the western USSR. The largest camps were at Kozelsk (Optina Monastery), Ostashkov (Stolobny Island on Lake Seliger near Ostashkov), and Starobelsk. Other camps were at Jukhnovo (rail station Babynino), Yuzhe (Talitsy), rail station Tyotkino ( from Putyvl), Kozelshchyna, Oranki, Vologda (rail station Zaonikeevo), and Gryazovets. Polish POWs captured by the Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Poland Kozelsk and Starobelsk were used mainly for military officers, while Ostashkov was used mainly for Polish Scouting, gendarmes, police officers, and prison officers. Some prisoners were members of other groups of Polish intelligentsia, such as priests, landowners, and law personnel. The approximate distribution of men throughout the camps was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men. According to a report from 19 November 1939, the NKVD had about 40,000 Polish POWs: 8,000‚Äì8,500 officers and warrant officers, 6,000‚Äì6,500 officers of police, and 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers who were still being held as POWs. In December, a wave of arrests resulted in the imprisonment of additional Polish officers. Ivan Serov reported to Lavrentiy Beria on 3 December that \\"in all, 1,057 former officers of the Polish Army had been arrested\\". The 25,000 soldiers and non-commissioned officers were assigned to forced labor (road construction, heavy metallurgy). =Preparations= Once at the camps, from October 1939 to February 1940, the Poles were subjected to lengthy interrogations and constant political agitation by NKVD officers, such as Vasily Zarubin. The prisoners assumed they would be released soon, but the interviews were in effect a selection process to determine who would live and who would die. According to NKVD reports, if a prisoner could not be induced to adopt a pro-Soviet attitude, he was declared a \\"hardened and uncompromising enemy of Soviet authority\\". On 5 March 1940, pursuant to a note to Joseph Stalin from Beria, six members of the Soviet Politburo ‚Äî Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Mikhail Kalinin ‚Äî signed an order to execute 25,700 Polish \\"nationalists and counterrevolutionaries\\" kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus. The reason for the massacre, according to the historian Gerhard Weinberg, was that Stalin wanted to deprive a potential future Polish military of a large portion of its talent. The Soviet leadership, and Stalin in particular, viewed the Polish prisoners as a \\"problem\\" as they might resist being under Soviet rule. Therefore, they decided the prisoners inside the \\"special camps\\" were to be shot as \\"avowed enemies of Soviet authority\\".  Executions  Beria to Stalin, proposing the execution of Polish officers The number of victims is estimated at about 22,000, with a lower limit of confirmed dead of 21,768. According to Soviet documents declassified in 1990, 21,857 Polish internees and prisoners were executed after 3 April 1940: 14,552 prisoners of war (most or all of them from the three camps) and 7,305 prisoners in western parts of the Byelorussian and Ukrainian SSRs. Of them 4,421 were from Kozelsk, 3,820 from Starobelsk, 6,311 from Ostashkov, and 7,305 from Byelorussian and Ukrainian prisons. The head of the NKVD Administration for Affairs of Prisoners of War and Internees, , was involved in \\"selections\\" of Polish officers to be executed at Katyn and elsewhere. Those who died at Katyn included soldiers (an admiral, two generals, 24 colonels, 79 lieutenant colonels, 258 majors, 654 captains, 17 naval captains, 85 privates, 3,420 non-commissioned officers, and seven chaplains), 200 pilots, government representatives and royalty (a prince, 43 officials), and civilians (three landowners, 131 refugees, 20 university professors, 300 physicians; several hundred lawyers, engineers, and teachers; and more than 100 writers and journalists). In all, the NKVD executed almost half the Polish officer corps. Altogether, during the massacre, the NKVD executed 14 Polish generals: Leon Billewicz (ret.), Bronis≈Çaw Bohatyrewicz (ret.), Xawery Czernicki (admiral), Stanis≈Çaw Haller (ret.), Aleksander Kowalewski (ret.), Henryk Minkiewicz (ret.), Kazimierz Orlik-≈Åukoski, Konstanty Plisowski (ret.), Rudolf Prich (killed in Lviv), Franciszek Sikorski (ret.), Leonard Skierski (ret.), Piotr Skuratowicz, Mieczys≈Çaw Smorawi≈Ñski, and Alojzy Wir-Konas (promoted posthumously). Not all of the executed were ethnic Poles, because the Second Polish Republic was a multiethnic state, and its officer corps included Belarusians, Ukrainians, and Jews. It is estimated about 8% of the Katyn massacre victims were Polish Jews. 395 prisoners were spared from the slaughter, among them Stanis≈Çaw Swianiewicz and J√≥zef Czapski. They were taken to the Yukhnov camp or Pavlishtchev Bor and then to Gryazovets. Up to 99% of the remaining prisoners were killed. People from the Kozelsk camp were executed in Katyn Forest; people from the Starobelsk camp were killed in the inner NKVD prison of Kharkiv and the bodies were buried near the village of Piatykhatky; and police officers from the Ostashkov camp were killed in the internal NKVD prison of Kalinin (Tver) and buried in Mednoye. A mass grave at Katyn, 1943 Detailed information on the executions in the Kalinin NKVD prison was provided during a hearing by Dmitry Tokarev, former head of the Board of the District NKVD in Kalinin. According to Tokarev, the shooting started in the evening and ended at dawn. The first transport, on 4 April 1940, carried 390 people, and the executioners had difficulty killing so many people in one night. The following transports held no more than 250 people. The executions were usually performed with German-made .25 ACP Walther Model 2 pistols supplied by Moscow, but Soviet-made 7.62√ó38mmR Nagant M1895 revolvers were also used. The executioners used German weapons rather than the standard Soviet revolvers, as the latter were said to offer too much recoil, which made shooting painful after the first dozen executions. Vasily Mikhailovich Blokhin, chief executioner for the NKVD‚Äîand quite possibly the most prolific executioner in history‚Äîis reported to have personally shot and killed 7,000 of the condemned, some as young as 18, from the Ostashkov camp at Kalinin prison, over 28 days in April 1940. After the condemned individual's personal information was checked and approved, he was handcuffed and led to a cell insulated with stacks of sandbags along the walls, and a heavy, felt-lined door. The victim was told to kneel in the middle of the cell, and was then approached from behind by the executioner and immediately shot in the back of the head or neck. The body was carried out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside and subjected to the same treatment. In addition to muffling by the rough insulation in the execution cell, the pistol gunshots were masked by the operation of loud machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. Some post-1991 revelations suggest prisoners were also executed in the same manner at the NKVD headquarters in Smolensk, though judging by the way the corpses were stacked, some captives may have been shot while standing on the edge of the mass graves. This procedure went on every night, except for the public May Day holiday. Some 3,000 to 4,000 Polish inmates of Ukrainian prisons and those from Belarus prisons were probably buried in Bykivnia and in Kurapaty respectively, about 50 women among them. Lieutenant Janina Lewandowska, daughter of Gen. J√≥zef Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki, was the only woman POW executed during the massacre at Katyn.  Discovery  Secretary of State of the Vichy regime Fernand de Brinon and others in Katyn at the graves of Mieczys≈Çaw Smorawi≈Ñski and Bronis≈Çaw Bohatyrewicz, April 1943 The question about the fate of the Polish prisoners was raised soon after Operation Barbarossa began in June 1941. The Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet government signed the Sikorski‚ÄìMayski agreement, which announced the willingness of both to fight together against Nazi Germany and for a Polish army to be formed on Soviet territory. The Polish general W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders began organizing this army, and soon he requested information about the missing Polish officers. During a personal meeting, Stalin assured him and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, the Polish Prime Minister, all the Poles were freed, and not all could be accounted because the Soviets \\"lost track\\" of them in Manchuria. J√≥zef Czapski investigated the fate of Polish officers between 1941 and 1942. In 1942, with the territory around Smolensk under German occupation, captive Polish railroad workers heard from the locals about a mass grave of Polish soldiers at Kozelsk near Katyn; finding one of the graves, they reported it to the Polish Underground State. The discovery was not seen as important, as nobody thought the discovered grave could contain so many victims. In early 1943, Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff, a German officer serving as the intelligence liaison between the Wehrmacht's Army Group Centre and Abwehr, received reports about mass graves of Polish military officers. These reports stated the graves were in the forest of Goat Hill near Katyn. He passed the reports to his superiors (sources vary on when exactly the Germans became aware of the graves‚Äîfrom \\"late 1942\\" to January‚ÄìFebruary 1943, and when the German top decision makers in Berlin received those reports [as early as 1 March or as late as 4 April]). Joseph Goebbels saw this discovery as an excellent tool to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies, and the Soviet Union, and reinforcement for the Nazi propaganda line about the horrors of Bolshevism, and American and British subservience to it. After extensive preparation, on 13 April, Reichssender Berlin broadcast to the world that German military forces in the Katyn forest near Smolensk had uncovered a ditch that was \\"28 metres long and 16 metres wide [92 ft by 52 ft], in which the bodies of 3,000 Polish officers were piled up in 12 layers\\". The broadcast went on to charge the Soviets with carrying out the massacre in 1940. Polish banknotes and epaulets recovered from mass graves The Germans brought in a European Red Cross committee called the Katyn Commission, comprising 12 forensic experts and their staff, from Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland, and Slovakia. The Germans were so intent on proving the Soviets were behind the massacre they even included some Allied prisoners of war, among them writer Ferdynand Goetel, the Polish Home Army prisoner from Pawiak. After the war, Goetel escaped with a fake passport due to an arrest warrant issued against him. Jan Emil Skiwski was a collaborator. J√≥zef Mackiewicz has published several texts about the crime. Two of the 12, the Bulgarian Marko Markov and the Czech Franti≈°ek H√°jek, with their countries becoming satellite states of the Soviet Union, were forced to recant their evidence, defending the Soviets and blaming the Germans. The Croatian pathologist Eduard Miloslaviƒá managed to escape to the US. The Katyn massacre was beneficial to Nazi Germany, which used it to discredit the Soviet Union. On 14 April 1943, Goebbels wrote in his diary: \\"We are now using the discovery of 12,000 Polish officers, killed by the GPU, for anti-Bolshevik propaganda on a grand style. We sent neutral journalists and Polish intellectuals to the spot where they were found. Their reports now reaching us from ahead are gruesome. The F√ºhrer has also given permission for us to hand out a drastic news item to the German press. I gave instructions to make the widest possible use of the propaganda material. We shall be able to live on it for a couple of weeks\\". Katyn exhumation, 1943 The Soviet government immediately denied the German charges. They claimed the Polish prisoners of war had been engaged in construction work west of Smolensk, and consequently were captured and executed by invading German units in August 1941. The Soviet response on 15 April to the initial German broadcast of 13 April, prepared by the Soviet Information Bureau, stated \\"Polish prisoners-of-war who in 1941 were engaged in construction work west of Smolensk and who...fell into the hands of the German-Fascist hangmen\\". In April 1943, the Polish government-in-exile led by Sikorski insisted on bringing the matter to the negotiation table with the Soviets and on opening an investigation by the International Red Cross. Stalin, in response, accused the Polish government of collaborating with Nazi Germany and broke off diplomatic relations with it. The Soviet Union also started a campaign to get the Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet government-in-exile of the Union of Polish Patriots led by Wanda Wasilewska. Sikorski died in the 1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash ‚Äîan event convenient for the Allied leaders. = Soviet actions = When Joseph Goebbels was informed in September 1943 that the German Army had to withdraw from the Katyn area, he wrote a prediction in his diary. His entry for 29 September 1943 reads: \\"Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers. That episode is one that is going to cause us quite a little trouble in the future. The Soviets are undoubtedly going to make it their business to discover as many mass graves as possible and then blame it on us\\". Having retaken the Katyn area almost immediately after the Red Army had recaptured Smolensk, around September‚ÄìOctober 1943, NKVD forces began a cover-up operation. They destroyed a cemetery the Germans had permitted the Polish Red Cross to build and removed other evidence. Witnesses were \\"interviewed\\" and threatened with arrest for collaborating with the Nazis if their testimonies disagreed with the official line. As none of the documents found on the dead had dates later than April 1940, the Soviet secret police planted false evidence to place the apparent time of the massacre in mid-1941, when the German military had controlled the area. NKVD operatives Vsevolod Merkulov and Sergei Kruglov issued a preliminary report, dated 10‚Äì11 January 1944, that concluded the Polish officers were shot by German soldiers. In January 1944, the Soviet Union sent another commission, the Extraordinary State Commission for ascertaining and investigating crimes perpetrated by the German-Fascist invaders to the site; the commission's name implied a predestined conclusion. It was headed by Nikolai Burdenko, the president of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (hence the commission is often known as the \\"Burdenko Commission\\"), who was appointed by Moscow to investigate the incident. Its members included prominent Soviet figures such as the writer Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, but no foreign personnel were allowed to join the commission. The Burdenko Commission exhumed the bodies, rejected the 1943 German findings the Poles were shot by the Soviet army, assigned the guilt to the Nazis, and concluded all the shootings were done by German occupation forces in late 1941. It is uncertain how many members of the commission were misled by the falsified reports and evidence, and how many actually suspected the truth. Cienciala and Materski note the commission had no choice but to issue findings in line with the Merkulov- Kruglov report, and Burdenko was likely aware of the cover-up. He reportedly admitted something like that to friends and family shortly before his death in 1946. The Burdenko Commission's conclusions would be consistently cited by Soviet sources until the official admission of guilt by the Soviet government on 13 April 1990. In January 1944, the Soviets also invited a group of more than a dozen mostly American and British journalists, accompanied by Kathleen Harriman, the daughter of the new American Ambassador W. Averell Harriman, and John F. Melby, third secretary at the American embassy in Moscow, to Katyn. Some regarded the inclusion of Melby and Harriman as a Soviet attempt to lend official weight to their propaganda. Melby's report noted the deficiencies in the Soviet case: problematic witnesses; attempts to discourage questioning of the witnesses; statements of the witnesses obviously being given as a result of rote memorization; and that \\"the show was put on for the benefit of the correspondents.\\" Nevertheless, Melby, at the time, felt on balance the Russian case was convincing. Harriman's report reached the same conclusion and after the war both were asked to explain why their conclusions seemed to be at odds with their findings, with the suspicion the conclusions were what the State Department wanted to hear. The journalists were less impressed and not convinced by the staged Soviet demonstration. Some Western Communists propagated Soviet propaganda, e.g., Alter Brody (introduced by Corliss Lamont) published the text Behind the Polish-Soviet Break. = Western response = British, Canadian, and American officers (POWs) brought by the Germans to view the exhumations The growing Polish-Soviet tension was beginning to strain Western-Soviet relations at a time when the Poles' importance to the Allies, significant in the first years of the war, was beginning to fade, due to the entry into the conflict of the military and industrial giants, the Soviet Union and the United States. In retrospective review of records, both British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt were increasingly torn between their commitments to their Polish ally and the demands by Stalin and his diplomats. According to the Polish diplomat Edward Bernard Raczy≈Ñski, Raczy≈Ñski and General Sikorski met privately with Churchill and Alexander Cadogan on 15 April 1943, and told them the Poles had proof the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. Raczy≈Ñski reports Churchill, \\"without committing himself, showed by his manner that he had no doubt of it\\". Churchill said \\"The Bolsheviks can be very cruel\\". On 17 April 1943 the Polish government issued a statement on this issue, asking for a Red Cross investigation, which was rejected by Stalin, who used the fact that Germans also requested such an investigation as a \\"proof\\" of Polish-German conspiracy, and which led to a deterioration of Polish-Soviet relations. Shortly afterward, however, on 24 April 1943, the British successfully pressured the Poles to withdraw the request for a Red Cross investigation, and Churchill assured the Soviets: \\"We shall certainly oppose vigorously any 'investigation' by the International Red Cross or any other body in any territory under German authority. Such an investigation would be a fraud and its conclusions reached by terrorism\\". Unofficial or classified UK documents concluded Soviet guilt was a \\"near certainty\\", but the alliance with the Soviets was deemed to be more important than moral issues; thus the official version supported the Soviets, up to censoring any contradictory accounts. Churchill asked Owen O'Malley to investigate the issue, but in a note to the Foreign Secretary he noted: \\"All this is merely to ascertain the facts, because we should none of us ever speak a word about it.\\" O'Malley pointed out several inconsistencies and near impossibilities in the Soviet version. Later, Churchill sent a copy of the report to Roosevelt on 13 August 1943. The report deconstructed the Soviet account of the massacre and alluded to the political consequences within a strongly moral framework but recognized there was no viable alternative to the existing policy. No comment by Roosevelt on the O'Malley report has been found. Churchill's own post-war account of the Katyn affair gives little further insight. In his memoirs, he refers to the 1944 Soviet inquiry into the massacre, which found the Germans responsible, and adds, \\"belief seems an act of faith\\". Lt. Col. John H. Van Vliet Jr communication on Katyn At the beginning of 1944, Ron Jeffery, an agent of British and Polish intelligence in occupied Poland, eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London with a report from Poland to the British government. His efforts were at first highly regarded, but subsequently ignored by the British, which a disillusioned Jeffery later attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents entrenched in the British system. Jeffery tried to inform the British government about the Katyn massacre, but was as a result released from the Army. In 1947, the Polish Government in exile 1944‚Äì1946 report on Katyn was transmitted to Telford Taylor. In the United States a similar line was taken, notwithstanding two official intelligence reports into the Katyn massacre that contradicted the official position. In 1944, Roosevelt assigned his special emissary to the Balkans, Navy Lieutenant Commander George Earle, to produce a report on Katyn. Earle concluded the massacre was committed by the Soviet Union. Having consulted with Elmer Davis, director of the United States Office of War Information, Roosevelt rejected the conclusion (officially), declared he was convinced of Nazi Germany's responsibility, and ordered that Earle's report be suppressed. When Earle requested permission to publish his findings, the President issued a written order to desist. Earle was reassigned and spent the rest of the war in American Samoa. A further report in 1945, supporting the same conclusion, was produced and stifled. In 1943, the Germans took two U.S. POWs‚ÄîCapt. Donald B. Stewart and Col. John H. Van Vliet‚Äîto Katyn for an international news conference. Documents released by the National Archives and Records Administration in September 2012 revealed Stewart and Van Vliet sent coded messages to their American superiors indicating they saw proof that implicated the Soviets. Three lines of evidence were cited. Firstly, the Polish corpses were in such an advanced state of decay that the Nazis could not have killed them, as they had only taken over the area in 1941. Secondly, none of the numerous Polish artifacts, such as letters, diaries, photographs and identification tags pulled from the graves, were dated later than the spring of 1940. Most incriminating was the relatively good state of the men's uniforms and boots, which showed they had not lived long after being captured. Later, in 1945, Van Vliet submitted a report concluding the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. His superior, Major General Clayton Lawrence Bissell, General George Marshall's assistant chief of staff for intelligence, destroyed the report. Washington kept the information secret, presumably to appease Stalin and not distract from the war against the Nazis. During the 1951‚Äì52 Congressional investigation into Katyn, Bissell defended his action before the United States Congress, arguing it was not in the U.S. interest to antagonize an ally (the USSR) whose assistance the nation needed against the Empire of Japan. In 1950, Van Vliet recreated his wartime report. In 2014, a copy of a report Van Vliet made in France during 1945 was discovered.  Postwar trials  From 28 December 1945 to 4 January 1946, a Soviet military court in Leningrad tried seven Wehrmacht servicemen. One of them, Arno D√ºre, who was charged with murdering numerous civilians using machine-guns in Soviet villages, confessed to having taken part in the burial (though not the execution) of 15,000 to 20,000 Polish POWs in Katyn. For this he was spared execution and was given 15 years of hard labor. His confession was full of absurdities, and thus he was not used as a Soviet prosecution witness during the Nuremberg trials. He later recanted his confession, claiming the investigators forced him to confess. I. S. Yazhborovskaja, A. Yu. Yablokov, V. S.

(paragraph preceding footnote [40] in the web version). A review of this book appeared as At the London conference that drew up the indictments of German war crimes before the Nuremberg trials, the Soviet negotiators put forward the allegation, \\"In September 1941, 925 Polish officers who were prisoners of war were killed in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk\\". The U.S. negotiators agreed to include it, but were \\"embarrassed\\" by the inclusion (noting the allegation had been debated extensively in the press) and concluded it would be up to the Soviets to sustain it.Alderman, S. S., \\"Negotiating the Nuremberg Trial Agreements, 1945\\", in Raymond Dennett and Joseph E. Johnson, edd., Negotiating With the Russians (Boston, MA: World Peace Foundation, [1951]), p. 96 At the trials in 1946, Soviet General Roman Rudenko raised the indictment, stating \\"one of the most important criminal acts for which the major war criminals are responsible was the mass execution of Polish prisoners of war shot in the Katyn forest near Smolensk by the German fascist invaders\\", but failed to make the case and the U.S. and British judges dismissed the charges. It was not the purpose of the court to determine whether Germany or the Soviet Union was responsible for the crime, but rather to attribute the crime to at least one of the defendants, which the court was unable to do.  1950s  In 1951 and 1952, with the Korean War as a background, a congressional investigation chaired by Rep. Ray Madden and known as the Madden Committee investigated the Katyn massacre. It concluded the Poles had been killed by the Soviet NKVD and recommended the Soviets be tried before the International Court of Justice. However, the question of responsibility remained controversial in the West as well as behind the Iron Curtain. In the United Kingdom in the late 1970s, plans for a memorial to the victims bearing the date 1940 (rather than 1941) were condemned as provocative in the political climate of the Cold War. It has also been alleged that the choice made in 1969 for the location of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic war memorial at the former Belarusian village named Khatyn, the site of the 1943 Khatyn massacre, was made to cause confusion with Katyn. The two names are similar or identical in many languages, and were often confused. In Poland, the pro-Soviet authorities following the Soviet occupation after the war covered up the matter in accordance with the official Soviet propaganda line, deliberately censoring any sources that might provide information about the crime. Katyn was a forbidden topic in postwar Poland. Censorship in the Polish People's Republic was a massive undertaking and Katyn was specifically mentioned in the \\"Black Book of Censorship\\" used by the authorities to control the media and academia. Not only did government censorship suppress all references to it, but even mentioning the atrocity was dangerous. In the late 1970s, democracy groups like the Workers' Defence Committee and the Flying University defied the censorship and discussed the massacre, in the face of arrests, beatings, detentions, and ostracism. In 1981, Polish trade union Solidarity erected a memorial with the simple inscription \\"Katyn, 1940\\". It was confiscated by the police and replaced with an official monument with the inscription: \\"To the Polish soldiers‚Äîvictims of Hitlerite fascism‚Äîreposing in the soil of Katyn\\". Nevertheless, every year on the day of Zaduszki, similar memorial crosses were erected at PowƒÖzki Cemetery and numerous other places in Poland, only to be dismantled by the police. Katyn remained a political taboo in the Polish People's Republic until the fall of the Eastern Bloc in 1989. In the Soviet Union during the 1950s, the head of KGB, Alexander Shelepin, proposed and carried out the destruction of many documents related to the Katyn massacre to minimize the chance the truth would be revealed. His 3 March 1959 note to Nikita Khrushchev, with information about the execution of 21,857 Poles and with the proposal to destroy their personal files, became one of the documents that was preserved and eventually made public.  Revelations  Monument in Katowice, Poland, memorializing \\"Katyn, Kharkiv, Mednoye and other places of killing in the former USSR in 1940\\" During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katy≈Ñ Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: > It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the > majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of > Katy≈Ñ. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems > very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, > for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from > the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of > true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will > make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was > able to travel here. His remarks were given extensive coverage on Soviet television. On 13 April 1990, the forty-seventh anniversary of the discovery of the mass graves, the USSR formally expressed \\"profound regret\\" and admitted Soviet secret police responsibility. The day was declared a worldwide Katyn Memorial Day ().  Post-communist investigations  In 1990, future Russian President Boris Yeltsin released the top-secret documents from the sealed \\"Package ‚Ññ1.\\" and transferred them to the new Polish president Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa. Among the documents was a proposal by Lavrentiy Beria, dated 5 March 1940, to execute 25,700 Poles from Kozelsk, Ostashkov and Starobelsk camps, and from certain prisons of Western Ukraine and Belarus, signed by Stalin (among others). Another document transferred to the Poles was Aleksandr Shelepin's 3 March 1959 note to Nikita Khrushchev, with information about the execution of 21,857 Poles, as well as a proposal to destroy their personal files to reduce the possibility documents related to the massacre would be uncovered later. The revelations were also publicized in the Russian press, where they were interpreted as being one outcome of an ongoing power struggle between Yeltsin and Gorbachev. In 1991, the Chief Military Prosecutor for the Soviet Union began proceedings against Pyotr Soprunenko for his role in the Katyn killings, but eventually declined to prosecute because Soprunenko was 83, almost blind, and recovering from a cancer operation. During the interrogation, Soprunenko defended himself by denying his own signature. Ceremony of military upgrading of Katyn massacre victims, Pi≈Çsudski Square, Warsaw, 10 November 2007 During Kwa≈õniewski's visit to Russia in September 2004, Russian officials announced they were willing to transfer all the information on the Katyn massacre to the Polish authorities as soon as it became declassified. In March 2005 the Prosecutor-General's Office of the Russian Federation concluded a decade-long investigation of the massacre. Chief Military Prosecutor Alexander Savenkov announced the investigation was able to confirm the deaths of 1,803 out of 14,542 Polish citizens who had been sentenced to death while in three Soviet camps. He did not address the fate of about 7,000 victims who had not been in POW camps, but in prisons. Savenkov declared the massacre was not a genocide, that Soviet officials who had been found guilty of the crime were dead and that, consequently, \\"there is absolutely no basis to talk about this in judicial terms\\". Of the 183 volumes of files gathered during the Russian investigation, 116 were declared to contain state secrets and were classified. On 22 March 2005, the Polish Sejm unanimously passed an act requesting the Russian archives to be declassified. The Sejm also requested Russia to classify the Katyn massacre as a crime of genocide. The resolution stressed that the authorities of Russia \\"seek to diminish the burden of this crime by refusing to acknowledge it was genocide and refuse to give access to the records of the investigation into the issue, making it difficult to determine the whole truth about the killing and its perpetrators.\\" In late 2007 and early 2008, several Russian newspapers, including Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Nezavisimaya Gazeta, printed stories that implicated the Nazis in the crime, spurring concern this was done with the tacit approval of the Kremlin. As a result, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance decided to open its own investigation. In 2008, the Polish Foreign Ministry asked the government of Russia about alleged footage of the massacre filmed by the NKVD during the killings, something the Russians have denied exists. Polish officials believe this footage, as well as further documents showing cooperation of Soviets with the Gestapo during the operations, are the reason for Russia's decision to classify most of the documents about the massacre. wiadomosci.gazeta.pl: \\"NKWD filmowa≈Ço rozstrzelania w Katyniu\\" , 17 July 2008 In the following years, 81 volumes of the case were declassified and transferred to the Polish government. , 35 out of 183 volumes of files remain classified. In June 2008, Russian courts consented to hear a case about the declassification of documents about Katyn and the judicial rehabilitation of the victims. In an interview with a Polish newspaper, Vladimir Putin called Katyn a \\"political crime\\". On 21 April 2010, the Russian Supreme Court ordered the Moscow City Court to hear an appeal in an ongoing Katyn legal case. A civil rights group, Memorial, said the ruling could lead to a court decision to open up secret documents providing details about the killings of thousands of Polish officers. On 8 May 2010, Russia handed over to Poland 67 volumes from \\"criminal case No. 159\\", launched in the 1990s to investigate the Soviet-era mass killings of Polish officers. Copies of these volumes, each comprising about 250 pages, were packed in six boxes. With each box weighing approximately , the total weight of all the documents stood at about . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev handed one of the volumes to the acting Polish president, Bronislaw Komorowski. Medvedev and Komorowski agreed the two states should continue to try to reveal the truth about the tragedy. The Russian president reiterated Russia would continue to declassify documents on the Katyn massacre. The acting Polish president said Russia's move might lay a good foundation for improving bilateral relations. In November 2010, the Russian State Duma admitted in an official declaration that Joseph Stalin and Soviet officials ordered the Soviet NKVD secret police under Lavrentiy Beria to commit the massacres. In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights declared admissible two complaints from relatives of the massacre victims against Russia regarding adequacy of the official investigation. In a ruling on 16 April 2012, the court found Russia had violated the rights of victims' relatives by not providing them with sufficient information about the investigation and described the massacre as a \\"war crime\\". But it also refused to judge the effectiveness of the Soviet Russian investigation because the related events took place before Russia ratified the Human Rights Convention in 1998. The plaintiffs filed an appeal but a 21 October 2013 ruling essentially reaffirmed the prior one, noting Russian courts failed to substantiate adequately why some critical information remained classified. Archive searches are continuing in Belarus state archives for one of execution lists containing names of 3870 officers whose identifies and exact place of execution (presumably Bykivnia and Kuropaty, as mentioned above) were not yet established. Legacy = Polish‚ÄìRussian relations = Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski laying wreaths at the Katyn massacre memorial complex, 11 April 2011 Russia and Poland remained divided on the legal description of the Katyn crime. The Poles considered it a case of genocide and demanded further investigations, as well as complete disclosure of Soviet documents. In June 1998, Boris Yeltsin and Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski agreed to construct memorial complexes at Katyn and Mednoye, the two NKVD execution sites on Russian soil. In September of that year, the Russians also raised the issue of Soviet prisoner of war deaths in the camps for Russian prisoners and internees in Poland (1919‚Äì24). About 16,000 to 20,000 POWs died in those camps due to communicable diseases. Some Russian officials argued it was \\"a genocide comparable to Katyn\\". A similar claim was raised in 1994; such attempts are seen by some, particularly in Poland, as a highly provocative Russian attempt to create an \\"anti-Katyn\\" and \\"balance the historical equation\\". The fate of Polish prisoners and internees in Soviet Russia remains poorly researched. On 4 February 2010, the Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, invited his Polish counterpart, Donald Tusk, to attend a Katyn memorial service in April. The visit took place on 7 April 2010, when Tusk and Putin together commemorated the 70th anniversary of the massacre. Before the visit, the 2007 film Katy≈Ñ was shown on Russian state television for the first time. The Moscow Times commented that the film's premiere in Russia was likely a result of Putin's intervention.The Moscow Times: \\"'Katyn' Film Premieres on State TV\\", 5 April 2010 On 10 April 2010, an aircraft carrying Polish President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski with his wife and 87 other politicians and high-ranking army officers crashed in Smolensk, killing all 96 aboard the aircraft. The passengers were to attend a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre. The Polish nation was stunned; Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who was not on the plane, referred to the crash as \\"the most tragic Polish event since the war.\\" In the aftermath, a number of conspiracy theories began to circulate. The catastrophe has also had major echoes in the international and particularly the Russian press, prompting a rebroadcast of Katy≈Ñ on Russian television. The Polish President was to deliver a speech at the formal commemorations. The speech was to honour the victims, highlight the significance of the massacres in the context of post- war communist political history, as well as stress the need for Polish‚ÄìRussian relations to focus on reconciliation. Although the speech was never delivered, it has been published with a narration in the original Polish and a translation has also been made available in English.View From The Right \\"The Speech the Polish President was to give at the Katyn Memorial\\" (12 April 2010) In November 2010, the State Duma (lower house of the Russian parliament) passed a resolution declaring long-classified documents \\"showed that the Katyn crime was carried out on direct orders of Stalin and other Soviet officials\\". The declaration also called for the massacre to be investigated further to confirm the list of victims. Members of the Duma from the Communist Party denied the Soviet Union had been to blame for the Katyn massacre and voted against the declaration. On 6 December 2010, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed commitment to uncovering the whole truth about the massacre, stating \\"Russia has recently taken a number of unprecedented steps towards clearing up the legacy of the past. We will continue in this direction\\". The Communist Party of the Russian Federation and a number of other pro-Soviet Russian politicians and commentators claim that the story of Soviet guilt is a conspiracy and that the documents released in 1990 were forgeries. They insist that the original version of events, assigning guilt to the Nazis, is the correct version, and they call on the Russian government to start a new investigation that would revise the findings of 2004. A number of Russian historians and organizations such as \\"Memorial\\" openly admit the Soviet responsibility, pointing out inconsistencies in the alternative versions ‚Äì primarily the fact that another major mass execution site in Mednoye was never under German occupation and contained remains of victims originating from the same camps as those killed in Katyn, killed at the same time, and even though it was only exhumed in the 1990s it contained well preserved Polish uniforms, documents, souvenirs as well as Soviet newspapers dated 1940. = Memorials = Many monuments and memorials that commemorate the massacre have been erected worldwide. = In art, entertainment, and media = The Katyn massacre appears in many works of film, the fine arts, literature, and music. * Robert Harris' 1995 novel Enigma (subsequently made into a 2001 film) featured the discovery of the Katyn massacre as a central plot point. * The 1999 Academy Honorary Award recipient, Polish film director Andrzej Wajda, whose father Captain Jakub Wajda was killed in the NKVD prison of Kharkiv, made a film depicting the event, Katy≈Ñ (2007).

Family Bellomo is the son of Salvatore Bellomo. He is the double cousin of Genovese associate Liborio Thomas Bellomo; their fathers are brothers and their mothers are sisters. This has led law enforcement to confuse their identities on several occasions. In 1997, Liborio Thomas Bellomo swore in an affidavit that he was guilty of federal charges instead of Bellomo. Bellomo has three sons and one daughter. Acting boss and indictment In 1990, after Vincent Gigante's indictment in the Windows Case, Bellomo was appointed acting boss of the Genovese family. On June 11, 1996, Bellomo was indicted on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charges, including the murders of mobster Ralph DeSimone and Antonio DiLorenzo, extortion, and labor racketeering. DiLorenzo was found shot to death in the backyard of his home in West New York, New Jersey. DeSimone was found in the trunk of his car at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, shot five times. Both DeSimone and DiLorenzo were murdered because the Genovese leadership thought they were government informants. Bellomo's lawyers stated that their client passed two polygraph tests in which he denied killing anyone. FBI agents shaved Bellomo's head, looking for evidence that Bellomo had used drugs to beat the polygraph machines. In February 1997, prosecutors dropped the DeSimone and DiLorenzo murder charges and offered Bellomo a chance to plead guilty to extorting payoffs from a construction union and a garbage hauling company. Bellomo accepted the deal and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Prison and more indictments On July 13, 2001, the imprisoned Bellomo was indicted on money laundering charges related to the Genovese family's involvement in the waterfront rackets and control of the ILA. Bellomo was accused of hiding money stolen from the ILA's members pension fund account between 1996 and 1997. Bellomo again pleaded guilty to lesser charges, pushing back his scheduled release date in 2004. On February 23, 2006, Bellomo and over 30 Genovese family members were indicted on more racketeering charges. Bellomo was specifically charged with ordering the 1998 murder of Ralph Coppola, the acting captain of Bellomo's crew and Bellomo's good friend. On September 16, 1998, Coppola disappeared a few weeks before his sentencing on fraud charges and was never found. Government witness Peter Peluso, a former lawyer for the Genovese family, stated that he had transported a message from Bellomo in prison ordering Coppola's murder. Some accounts state that Coppola was disrespectful, others say that he was stealing family profits. According to the Bellomo indictment: Peluso pleaded guilty to his role in the murder. However, the government had no proof that Peluso had indeed met with Bellomo. With insufficient evidence to press the murder charge against Bellomo, the government offered him a plea bargain for mail fraud. Bellomo accepted and received one additional year in prison. His daughter Sabrina, is credited with helping get her father a light sentence with a tearful plea to judge Lewis A. Kaplan. Due to his 12-year imprisonment, he missed her high school, college, and law school graduations. Release from prison On December 1, 2008, Bellomo was released from prisonLiborio Bellomo at the Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator after serving 12 years.

He especially occupied himself with the study of Oriental languages and literature, of which he became professor at the Hamburg gymnasium in 1712. At this time the Oppenheimer Collection was housed at Hamburg, and Wolf determined to devote himself to a description of Jewish literature based upon this collection.

According to the American Society of Cost Segregation Professionals, a cost segregation is \\"the process of identifying property components that are considered \\"personal property\\" or \\"land improvements\\" under the federal tax code.\\"American Society of Cost Segregation Professionals A cost segregation study identifies and reclassifies personal property assets to shorten the depreciation time for taxation purposes, which reduces current income tax obligations. Personal property assets include a building's non-structural elements, exterior land improvements and indirect construction costs.The primary goal of a cost segregation study is to identify all construction- related costs that can be depreciated over a shorter tax life (typically 5, 7 and 15 years) than the building (39 years for non-residential real property). Personal property assets found in a cost segregation study generally include items that are affixed to the building but do not relate to the overall operation and maintenance of the building. Land Improvements generally include items located outside a building that are affixed to the land and do not relate to the overall operation and maintenance of a building. Reducing tax lives results in accelerated depreciation deductions, a reduced tax liability, and increased cash flow. Land improvements include parking lots, driveways, paved areas, site utilities, walk ways, sidewalks, curbing, concrete stairs, fencing, retaining walls, block walls, car ports, dumpster enclosures, and landscaping. Landscaping itself can be separated into plants, trees, shrubs, sod, mulch, rock, and security lighting.https://www.irs.gov/businesses/cost- segregation-guide-chapter-72-industry-specific-guidance-restaurants A Cost Segregation study allows a taxpayer who owns real estate to reclassify certain assets as Section 1245 property with shorter useful lives for depreciation purposes, rather than the useful life for Section 1250 property. Recent tax law changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) have given a boost to cost segregation. Bonus depreciation was increased from 50% to 100% on certain qualifying assets. Real estate investors will receive immediate expensing of certain 5, 7 and 15 year property. TCJA also allows used property that was acquired after Sept. 27, 2017 to qualify for this special depreciation treatment. A quality cost segregation will separate any costs that qualify under the new bonus depreciation rules.  Property asset classification  Analysis of capital expenditures is used to determine appropriate asset classifications. Cost segregation identifies building costs that would typically be depreciated over a 27.5 or 39-year period and reclassifies them to permit a shorter, accelerated method of depreciation for certain building costs. Costs for non-structural elements, such as wall covering, carpet, accent lighting, portions of the electrical system, and exterior site improvements such as sidewalks and landscaping, can often be depreciated over five, seven or 15 years, rather than over 27.5 or 39 years.  Eligibility  Real property eligible for cost segregation includes buildings that have been purchased, constructed, expanded or remodeled since 1987. A formal engineering based study is typically cost-effective for buildings purchased or remodeled at a cost greater than $750,000. A cost segregation study is most efficient for new buildings recently constructed, but it can also uncover retroactive tax deductions for older buildings which can generate significant short benefits due to \\"catch-up\\" depreciation.  Cost segregation study process  \\"A cost-segregation specialist can perform a nonintrusive yet detailed engineering study of a building's walls, flooring, and ceilings; and its plumbing, electrical, lighting, telecommunications, heating and cooling systems\\" (Money Doesn't Grow on Trees, But It Could be Hidden in the Walls By William J. Barnes, CPA). Usually, a construction engineer will analyze architectural drawings, mechanical and electrical plans, and other blueprints to segregate the structural and general building electrical and mechanical components from those linked to personal property. The study also allocates ‚Äúsoft costs,‚Äù such as architect and engineering fees, to all components of the building. \\"In general, a study by a construction engineer is more reliable than one conducted by someone with no engineering or construction background. However, the possession of specific construction knowledge is not the only criterion. Experience in cost estimating and allocation, as well as knowledge of the applicable law, are other important criteria. A quality study identifies the preparer and always references his/her credentials, experience and expertise in the cost segregation area\\" (www.irs.gov - Cost Segregation Audit Technique Guide - Chapter 4 - Principal Elements of a Quality Cost Segregation Study and Report).  Tax benefits of cost segregation  In addition to providing lower taxes, cost segregation can benefit businesses in a number of ways: # Maximizing tax savings by adjusting the timing of deductions. When an asset's life is shortened, depreciation expense is accelerated and tax payments are decreased during the early stages of a property's life. This, in turn, releases cash for investment opportunities or current operating needs. # Creating an audit trail. Improper documentation of cost and asset classifications can lead to an unfavorable audit adjustment. A properly documented cost segregation helps resolve IRS inquiries at the earliest stages. # Playing Catch-Up: Retroactivity. Since 1996, taxpayers can capture immediate retroactive savings on property added since 1987. Previous rules, which provided a four-year catch-up period for retroactive savings, have been amended to allow taxpayers to take the entire amount of the adjustment in the year the cost segregation is completed. This opportunity to recapture unrecognized depreciation in one year presents an opportunity to perform retroactive cost segregation analyses on older properties to increase cash flow in the current year. # Additional tax benefits. Cost segregation can also reveal opportunities to reduce real estate tax liabilities and identify certain sales and use tax savings opportunities.  Downsides to Cost Segregation Studies  Downsides to cost segregation studies include cost, the triggering of depreciation recapture and understatement penalties for taxpayers that use cost segregation too aggressively.http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/2004/Aug/CostSegregationApplied.htm See also * Depreciation * MACRS  Notes  External links * \\"Cost Segregation Applied\\" The Journal of Accountancy * American Society of Cost Segregation Professionals * IRS Cost Segregation Audit Techniques Guide Category:United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Category:Real estate in the United States Category:Taxation in the United States ","title":"Cost segregation study"},{"id":"7969504","text":"Nicholas Roerich. Longships Built in the Land of the Slavs (1903) √Ålaborg or √Åluborg is the name of a Varangian fort mentioned in the Norse sagas about Halfdan Eysteinsson and Hrolf Ganger. The first saga indicates that it was possible to sail from Aldeigjuborg (Ladoga) to Alaborg northward by sea, but a more rapid and practicable way was by land eastward. The text implies that Alaborg and Aldeigjuborg were two rivals, situated at a short distance from each other. In 1989, Tatiana Jackson demonstrated that the only location conforming to this description is the so-called \\"Gorodishche\\" (literally, \\"abandoned fortress\\") on the Syas River. It was the only sizable settlement in the area east of Ladoga until the 13th or 14th century. Its Norse name may derive from the Valya River that flows in the vicinity. Archaeology Nikolay Repnikov was the first historian to recognize the archaeological importance of the village Gorodishche on the Syas River (). Repnikov published his observations in 1900 but it was not until 1929 that Vladimir Ravdonikas started extensive excavations of the site. During the years of Stalinism, the finds brought to light by Ravdonikas were lost, while the archaeological site was turned into a quarry for construction of a highway. As a result, the core of the site was totally destroyed and its overall integrity deteriorated. Excavations of Alaborg were resumed in 1987‚Äì1990 by Oleg Boguslavsky and Anna Machinskaya. They defined the following areas of archaeological interest: * an urban settlement (gorodishche) on a promontory between the river and a creek (now almost totally destroyed); * rural settlements on the same promontory; * a cluster of fifteen (formerly twenty) large conical tumuli to the northwest from the promontory; * an outcrop of eight tumuli in the village Gorodishche; * twenty five small mounds, about one mile to the southeast from the promontory; * twenty nine \\"druzhina\\" mounds, about one mile to the northwest from the promontory (almost all excavated in 1929); * a chain of barrows along the right bank of the river (ten barrows were attested in the 1920s, only two extant as of 1993). Historical context Compared with the Volkhov, the Syas River provided an alternative (and more rapid) route from the Baltic to the Volga. Its main drawback was the rapids, which made the river impracticable for Viking longships. While crossing the rapids, the ships were particularly susceptible to attacks from land. To protect these key points, the Varangians established the fortified settlements of Duboviki and Gorodische at the head of the lower and upper Volkhov rapids, accordingly. In a parallel fashion, Alaborg commanded a 20-metre-high hill above the Syas rapids (although no traces of actual fortifications have been found there in the 1980s). Boguslavsky and Machinskaya date the earliest Scandinavian burial at Alaborg to ca. 700 CE. Archaeologically, the site has much in common with Ladoga. It seems that the two sites developed on parallel lines. Alaborg was destroyed by fire and abandoned before the 930s, most likely towards the end of the 9th century. At that period all the other centres of the Rus' Khaganate faced with destruction, which Constantine Zuckerman associates with Vadim's uprising, as recorded in the East Slavic chronicles.

It is aligned to the Pennsylvania Academic Standards. Lincoln Park provides academics in two different formats: direct instruction and online. A team of artists and educators was assembled by one of the school's founders and principal architects, Stephen Catanzarite, to develop the school's curriculum over a period of one year. Catanzarite secured a grant from Pittsburgh's Grable Foundation, and recruited Dr. Micheal Cerveris, an alumnus of the Juilliard School, retired arts administrator at the university level, and a staff member of the Arts Education Collaborative in Pittsburgh to oversee this process. Lincoln Park has a partnership with the Community College of Beaver County to offer juniors and seniors college-level coursework in select subjects. Course of study for each student is chosen through the collaborative effort of the parents, student, and professional staff. A personalized education plan is developed for each student to address the student's abilities, learning needs, learning style, future educational plans, and/or employment interests. The school has also developed key strategic partnerships with organizations such as the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Berklee College of Music, and the Yamaha Music and Wellness Institute, and also collaborated in a research project with the MIT Media Lab.

Of the identified students 62% had a specific learning disability. The school uses the services of the Beaver Valley IU 27 to meet the needs of its students that have an IEP - Individual Education Plan. In accordance with state and federal regulations, Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School established and implemented procedures to locate, identify and evaluate school age students suspected of being eligible for special education services. These procedures include, but are not limited to: review of records, various modes of screening (reading and math screenings are completed the first week of school), and/or recommendation of teacher and/or parent. There is currently in place a referral system for students who may be in need of assistance. Instructional strategies are updated and revised as needed for individual student needs. Teachers attend trainings to ensure that strategies employed address the individual needs of the student in special education. Strategies used for the special education student are dependent upon the needs reflected in the IEP. Funding for special education students comes from the respective student's home school district which is required to pay all the state and federal subsidies it receives for the student to the charter school. The school uses Response to Intervention (RTI) methodology combined with differentiated instruction in the classroom is designed to help students with different learning styles and needs. Title I interventions are provided for reading and mathematics. Students are administered a benchmark mathematics test. Those that do not meet the proficiency level are placed in a comprehensive math program designed to target their areas of weakness. =Gifted education= The Administration reported that fewer than 10 of the school's students were gifted in 2009. By law, the school must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Transportation Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School uses multiple forms of transportation to accomplish the task of bussing students to school. As charter school law requires school districts within a ten-mile range to transport students who choose to attend a charter school, Lincoln Park has seven districts who participate. Those districts are: Beaver Area School District, Blackhawk School District, Central Valley School District, Hopewell Area School District, South Side Area School District, Midland Borough School District and Western Beaver County School District. For those students who do not reside in one of these districts, Lincoln Park contracts with a private company operating within individual school districts. Most of these students catch the bus at a hub stop where up to a few dozen students may get on. Parking lots are available for students who drive to school. Accommodations and modifications to transportation are provided for any student with that need. Food Service Program and Wellness There is a daily breakfast and lunch program at the school. It is a participant in a wellness program as mandated by Pennsylvania Department of Education for all schools involved with The National School Lunch Program. The school uses an outside agency to facilitate the nutrition program. Of the 482 students enrolled throughout the year; 47 received reduced-rate lunches, and 101 received federal free lunches due to family poverty. Budget The school's annual budget is developed by the administration and subject to approval by the Board of Trustees. The school does not levy any taxes. Reserves In 2010, the school reported a balance of zero in an unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $647,589.00 In 2008, Lincoln Park Administration reported a balance of $156,479 in its unreserved- undesignated fund. Pennsylvania public school agency reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania public school entities (school districts, charter schools and Intermediate Units combined) amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received an extra $31,861 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant School officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over hundreds of thousands in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of many school districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. Sports are part of the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (Class A) and the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. The sports offered are: men's basketball, men's and women's golf and women's volleyball. Lincoln Park has won the WPIAL Men's Basketball championship in 2014, 2018, and 2019 (2018, 2019 in Class 3A). The clubs/organization the school offers includes: Student Council, Environmental Club, National Honor Society, BatCat Press, The Siren, and Humanitarian Club. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.  Controversy  In 2007, just one year after the creation of the school, Pennsylvania Education Secretary Gerald L. Zahorchak became concerned with the school's accounting, citing the school double-billing students' home districts, misuse of taxpayer dollars, and questionable payments. Founder of Lincoln Park Nick Trombetta was accused of mail fraud, theft and bribery concerning a federal program, tax conspiracy and filing false tax returns in 2013, and pleaded guilty to tax conspiracy in August 2016, and diverted about $8 million from PA Cyber through other organizations. In March 2017, Shaun Rolly, a theatre teacher, committed suicide after being accused of possessing child pornography depicting 10-12 year olds. Due to the ongoing success of the Lincoln Park men's basketball team, some have accused the school of recruiting players for non-academic reasons, since students from nearby districts can elect to attend the school. Lincoln Park issued a statement that the accusations were false and that the school abides by WPIAL rules.

After attending Edinburgh Academy and Christ's College at Cambridge University, Fraser received his medical training from the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1910 with M.B., Ch.B. He interned at the Royal Infirmary and the Hospital for Sick Children, both in Edinburgh. In 1922, he received his M.D. from the University of Edinburgh Medical School. By chance, due to an illness of his father's, Fraser was asked to host a dinner in honor of Abraham Flexner. Flexner convinced Fraser to go to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in the United States for his postgraduate work. While in the United States, Fraser worked on poliomyelitis and electrocardiographs with Rufus Cole, Simon Flexner and Alfred E. Cohn at the Rockefeller. He then went on to work with W. T. Longcope at Presbyterian Hospital. When World War I broke out, Fraser joined up with the Harvard Unit and returned to England. In 1920 Fraser became Assistant Director of the Medical Unit at Saint Bartholomew's Hospital in London. When Archibald Garrod left the position of Director later that year to go to Oxford, Fraser was appointed to it. He remained at Bart's until 1934 when he was asked to become the first Professor of Medicine at the Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital. In 1939 Fraser was asked to join the Emergency Medical Services and soon was appointed Director General. For his work with the EMS and Hammersmith, Fraser was knighted in 1944. At the close of World War II Fraser resigned from Hammersmith to undertake the establishment of a British Postgraduate Medical Federation as its first Director. The Federation loosely joined and established postgraduate medical schools and institutes in the London area. In 1960 Fraser retired from academic life. In 1919 Fraser married Mary Claudine Stirling Fraser, daughter of Colin Dunlop Donald and widow of Captain John Alexander Fraser, Francis Fraser's first cousin. Mary Claudine had two daughters from the previous marriage, Alexandra Mary Agnes and Margaret Stirling, and with Francis Fraser had one son, Peter Basil Fraser.

It ensued in skirmishing in which several demonstrators and four police officers were killed. The intent of the demonstration was \\"..to awaken the maltreated Armenians and to make the Sublime Porte fully aware of the miseries of the Armenians.\\"Khan-Azat, op. cit., VI (February 1928), pp. 124‚Äì125  Background  Towards the close of the nineteenth century, Armenian revolutionary societies began to agitate for reform and renewed European attention to the Armenian Question. The Hnchak party in particular utilized the tactic of mass demonstration to hasten the process. They had been suspected to be behind an earlier June 1890 protest in Erzerum that resulted in a massacre. July 27, 1890 On 27 July 1890, Harutiun Jang√ºlian, Mihran Damadian and Hambartsum Boyajian interrupted the Divine Liturgy at the Armenian Cathedral in Constantinople to read a manifesto and denounce the indifference of the Armenian patriarch and Armenian National Assembly. They soon forced the patriarch to join a procession heading to Yildiz Palace to demand implementation of Article 61 of the 1878 Treaty of Berlin. Even as the procession was gathering, police surrounded the crowd, and shots were fired that resulted in a number of deaths, including four policemen and three protestors. Result The Hunchaks concluded that the demonstrations at Kum Kapu were unsuccessful.The Armenian revolutionary movement: the development of Armenian political parties through the nineteenth century By Louise Nalbandian, page 119 At the same time, while there was no clear result from the event, the Hunchak press praised the courage shown by those present.

Its route started in Santa Clarita (25 miles north of Los Angeles), went northeast to Towne Pass and dropped into Death Valley, traversed Death Valley in the southern direction, crossed Mojave Desert and ended at Twentynine Palms. The race was named after the total length of its course (508 miles) and the location of its midpoint (near Furnace Creek). Rather than use names or numbers as in other races and other sports, the Furnace Creek 508 identified riders and teams with \\"totems\\" - animal names said to signify or have a special meaning for a rider or team. The race was discontinued in 2014 due to a policy change of the Death Valley National Park that prohibited competitive cycling events in the park. Its organizers have since created a new annual event, the \\"Silver State 508\\", which keeps the overall format and the total distance of the course, but takes place in Nevada. At of length and of elevation gain, the Furnace Creek route was roughly comparable to four typical mountain stages of Tour de France ridden back-to-back.

His mother, Cherry Groce, was shot by police during a dawn raid on her home, starting the 1985 Brixton riot in London, England. He is now a published poet, having won the Cheltenham Poetry Prize, and actively engages with young people to inform them of his own experiences. Early biography Michael Groce was brought up in Tinworth House, on a rough housing estate in Vauxhall, London. Much of his life from age six was spent in residential care. He was involved with street gangs, and had been exposed to guns during his childhood. He spent time in and out of prison; throughout his life, he accrued 50 convictions and 15 different spells in prison. Role in the riots A few days before the riots, Michael Groce was involved in a domestic dispute with his girlfriend during which he fired a gun. Shortly afterwards, he heard a knocking on the door, and went down to answer it, believing it to be a neighbour complaining about the gunshot. Instead, he found a police officer, enquiring if he was Michael Groce. Groce attempted to close the door, but the police officer would not let him, and only left after Groce put the gun into the officer's mouth. Following this incident, Groce fled his mother's house, and took up residence with his sister. After three days of hiding, when he turned on the television, he was presented with a picture of his mother accompanying a news story about her shooting and subsequent paralysis from the waist down. She had been shot in a police raid in search of him. Her shooting triggered the riots. Groce handed himself in to the police shortly afterwards. Community work Following the riots, Michael Groce attempted to help the community recover - he ran a youth football team, trying to provide a fun alternative to crime. He now runs poetry, personal development and motivational workshops in schools, and gives talks to dissuade others from making mistakes similar to those he made. Political activity In May 2018, Groce ran as the Green Party candidate in the Lambeth Council Elections where he stood in the Coldharbour ward. He polled 761 votes finishing the runner up in fourth place out of twelve candidates. Later that year, Groce was again selected as the Green candidate for the Brixton Coldharbour ward by-election where he again finished in second place with 30.5% of the vote (912 votes), an increase of 15%. Poetry Groce is also a poet. He wrote poetry in prison, often at the request of other inmates to send in letters to partners or family. He won the Cheltenham Festivals, and owns his own performance club.

These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb, architectural best practices, etc. These are guidelines for software structural quality. Software programmers are highly recommended to follow these guidelines to help improve the readability of their source code and make software maintenance easier. Coding conventions are only applicable to the human maintainers and peer reviewers of a software project. Conventions may be formalized in a documented set of rules that an entire team or company follows, or may be as informal as the habitual coding practices of an individual. Coding conventions are not enforced by compilers. Software maintenance Reducing the cost of software maintenance is the most often cited reason for following coding conventions. In their introduction to code conventions for the Java programming language, Sun Microsystems provides the following rationale: > Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons: > *40%‚Äì80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to > maintenance.Robert L. Glass: Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering; > Addison Wesley, 2003. *Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life > by the original author. *Code conventions improve the readability of the > software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and > thoroughly. *If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make > sure it is as well packaged and clean as any other product you create. =Quality= Software peer review frequently involves reading source code. This type of peer review is primarily a defect detection activity. By definition, only the original author of a piece of code has read the source file before the code is submitted for review. Code that is written using consistent guidelines is easier for other reviewers to understand and assimilate, improving the efficacy of the defect detection process. Even for the original author, consistently coded software eases maintainability. There is no guarantee that an individual will remember the precise rationale for why a particular piece of code was written in a certain way long after the code was originally written. Coding conventions can help. Consistent use of whitespace improves readability and reduces the time it takes to understand the software. Coding standards Where coding conventions have been specifically designed to produce high-quality code, and have then been formally adopted, they then become coding standards. Specific styles, irrespective of whether they are commonly adopted, do not automatically produce good quality code. Reduction of complexity Complexity is a factor going against security. Tom Gillis. \\"Complexity is the enemy of security\\". The management of complexity includes the following basic principle: minimize the amount of code written during the project development. This prevents unnecessary work which prevents unnecessary cost, both upfront and downstream. This is simply because if there is less code, it is less work not only to create the application, but also to maintain it. Complexity is managed both at the design stage (how the project is architectured) and at the development stage (by having simpler code). If the coding is kept basic and simple then the complexity will be minimised. Very often this is keeping the coding as 'physical' as possible - coding in a manner that is very direct and not highly abstract. This produces optimal code that is easy to read and follow. Complexity can also be avoided simply by not using complicated tools for simple jobs. The more complex the code is the more likely it is to be buggy, the more difficult the bugs are to find and the more likely there are to be hidden bugs. =Refactoring= Refactoring refers to a software maintenance activity where source code is modified to improve readability or improve its structure. Software is often refactored to bring it into conformance with a team's stated coding standards after its initial release. Any change that does not alter the behavior of the software can be considered refactoring. Common refactoring activities are changing variable names, renaming methods, moving methods or whole classes and breaking large methods (or functions) into smaller ones. Agile software development methodologies plan for regular (or even continuous) refactoring making it an integral part of the team software development process. Task automation Coding conventions allow to have simple scripts or programs whose job is to process source code for some purpose other than compiling it into an executable. It is common practice to count the software size (Source lines of code) to track current project progress or establish a baseline for future project estimates. Consistent coding standards can, in turn, make the measurements more consistent. Special tags within source code comments are often used to process documentation, two notable examples are javadoc and doxygen. The tools specify the use of a set of tags, but their use within a project is determined by convention. Coding conventions simplify writing new software whose job is to process existing software. Use of static code analysis has grown consistently since the 1950s. Some of the growth of this class of development tools stems from increased maturity and sophistication of the practitioners themselves (and the modern focus on safety and security), but also from the nature of the languages themselves. Language factors All software practitioners must grapple with the problem of organizing and managing a large number of sometimes complex instructions. For all but the smallest software projects, source code (instructions) are partitioned into separate files and frequently among many directories. It was natural for programmers to collect closely related functions (behaviors) in the same file and to collect related files into directories. As software development shifted from purely procedural programming (such as found in FORTRAN) towards more object-oriented constructs (such as found in C++), it became the practice to write the code for a single (public) class in a single file (the 'one class per file' convention). FIFE coding standards Java has gone one step further - the Java compiler returns an error if it finds more than one public class per file. A convention in one language may be a requirement in another. Language conventions also affect individual source files. Each compiler (or interpreter) used to process source code is unique. The rules a compiler applies to the source creates implicit standards. For example, Python code is much more consistently indented than, say Perl, because whitespace (indentation) is actually significant to the interpreter. Python does not use the brace syntax Perl uses to delimit functions. Changes in indentation serve as the delimiters. Tcl, which uses a brace syntax similar to Perl or C/C++ to delimit functions, does not allow the following, which seems fairly reasonable to a C programmer: set i = 0 while {$i < 10} { puts \\"$i squared = [expr $i*$i]\\" incr i } The reason is that in Tcl, curly braces are not used only to delimit functions as in C or Java. More generally, curly braces are used to group words together into a single argument. In Tcl, the word while takes two arguments, a condition and an action. In the example above, while is missing its second argument, its action (because the Tcl also uses the newline character to delimit the end of a command). Common conventions There are a large number of coding conventions; see Coding Style for numerous examples and discussion. Common coding conventions may cover the following areas: * Comment conventions * Indent style conventions * Line length conventions * Naming conventions * Programming practices * Programming principles * Programming style conventions Coding standards include the CERT C Coding Standard, MISRA C, High Integrity C++.

In 1905, an end of slavery in Mauritania was declared by the colonial French administration but the vastness of Mauritania mostly gave the law very few successes. In 1981, Mauritania became the last country in the world to abolish slavery, when a presidential decree abolished the practice. However, no criminal laws were passed to enforce the ban. In 2007, \\"under international pressure\\", the government passed a law allowing slaveholders to be prosecuted. Despite this, in 2018 Global Slavery Index estimated the number living in slavery in the country to be 90,000 (or 2.1% of the population), which is a reduction from the 140,000 in slavery figure which the same organisation reported in 2013, while in 2017 the BBC reported a figure of 600,000 living in bondage. Sociologist Kevin Bales and Global Slavery Index estimate that Mauritania has the highest proportion of people in slavery of any country in the world. While other countries in the region have people in \\"slavelike conditions\\", the situation in Mauritania is \\"unusually severe\\", according to African history professor Bruce Hall and comprises largely of a Black population enslaved by Arab masters. The position of the government of Mauritania is that slavery is \\"totally finished ... all people are free\\", and that talk of it \\"suggests manipulation by the West, an act of enmity toward Islam, or influence from the worldwide Jewish conspiracy.\\" According to some human rights groups, the country might have jailed more anti-slavery activists than slave owners. Background A November 2009 United Nations mission, headed by UN Special Rapporteur Gulnara Shahinian, evaluated slavery practices in the country.ANI and Journal Tahalil reported on 2 November 2009 In an August 2010 report to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) it concluded that \\"despite laws, programmes and difference of opinion with regard to the existence of slavery in Mauritania, ... de facto slavery continues to exist in Mauritania\\". Slave status has been passed down through the generations. The descendants of black Africans captured during historical slave raids now live in Mauritania as \\"Black Moors\\" or haratin, some of them still serve as slaves to the lighter-skinned \\"White Moors\\" or beydan (\\"Whites\\") (that are Berbers or mixed Berber-Arabs, descendants of slave- owners known collectively as al-beydan). According to Global Slavery Index, slavery of adults and children in Mauritania \\"primarily takes the form of chattel slavery\\" (i.e. the slaves and their descendants \\"are the full property of their masters\\"). Slaves \\"may be bought and sold, rented out and given away as gifts\\". Slavery in Mauritania is \\"prevalent in both rural and urban areas\\", but women are reportedly \\"disproportionately affected\\" by slavery. Women slaves \\"usually work within the domestic sphere\\", caring for children and doing domestic chores, but \\"may also herd animals and farm\\". Women slaves \\"are subject to sexual assault by their masters\\". Because slave status is matrilineal, slaves typically serve the same families that their mothers and grandmothers did. They usually sleep and eat in the same quarters as the animals of their owning families. Slaves are \\"not restrained by chains\\" but by \\"economic\\" and \\"psychological\\" factors. They are denied education in secular fields that provide job skills, and taught that \\"questioning slavery is tantamount to questioning Islam\\". There is also a \\"grey area\\" or \\"a continuum\\" between slavery and freedom in Mauritania‚Äîreferred to politely as the \\"vestiges of slavery\\"‚Äîwhere sharecroppers and workers are exploited by Beydane landowners and bosses. According to Ahmed Vall Ould Dine, of Mauritanian Human Rights Watch, \\"Slaves tend to develop very close relations with their masters; the freed ones, who are poor and have inherited nothing from their parents, chose to remain under the auspices of their ex-masters as they provide them with basic necessities of life.\\" Two academics, Ahmed Meiloud and Mohamed El Mokhtar Sidi Haiba, have criticized statements on slavery in Mauritania by anti-slavery organizations and writers for alleged exaggeration, lack of statistical sources, factual errors. = French Colonialism = The French colonized Mauritania in 1904 during the Scramble for Africa. Mauritania and other territories the French owned were referred to as soci√©t√©s esclavagistes or \\"slave societies\\" because slavery was a tradition that they interacted with. The French reshaped slavery socially because ‚Äú French administrators and French missionaries created a role for themselves... that was, for the most part, compatible with local cultural customs‚Äù. However, there was not that great of an economic impact the prices were not raised high enough to promote a greater supply of slaves. There were several interpretations on the impact that colonialism had on African societies. Mahmood Madani believed that colonialism let the chief's power go unchecked because of the authority that backed them. However, other scholars believed that there was not a change of African institutions because Europeans were simply consumers . Either way, the French made themselves a part of an already existing slave trade in Mauritania. The French were able to control their territories with the use of African employees from those territories. Mauritanian employees worked low- level positions and the ‚Äúcolonial hierarchy operated on the assumption that its African employees would act as transparent, unthinking conduits who would link white colonial authorities to black African colonial subjects.‚Äù . The African employees were not seen as a threat despite the fact that they had the ability to control the flow of information between the Mauritanians and the French because of the language barrier. = Impact of religion = Islam is by far the largest religion in Mauritania, with the Maliki school of Sunni Islam as the dominant form. Maliki Islam in pre-colonial West-Africa campaigned hard against the trans-atlantic slave trade, but in the 19th and 20th centuries many Maliki's justified continued slavery inside Mauritania, in some or all of its forms. Still today, the dominant majority of Mauritanians believe that former slaves (irrespective of the status of their manumission) can not be full and equal citizens, let alone become imams. Attempts to end slavery in colonial Mauritania largely failed because abolitionism was molded by Orientalism, or the ideology that Africans were \\"exotic, intellectually retarded, emotionally sensual, governmentally despotic, culturally passive, and politically penetrable\\". Certain aspects of religion might have had an impact in the preservation of slavery-based structures. Concubinage, for example, was admitted in Islam and quite common. Concubines were expected to be treated humanely. Impressions of freedom were molded by notions of social order, and the belief that God would forgive the sins of slaves if they behaved obediently towards their masters. After 1980 Mauritania's ulama (clerical scholarly community) came to the consensus that no slaves had been acquired through jihad so there was no (however questionable) sharia-based legitimacy to continue enslavement. Government position Marie-Jos√© Domestici-Met (CNCDH) and Biram Dah Abeid who in 2009 was sentenced to six months in prison for allegedly taking part in unauthorised rally. The government of Mauritania (which is dominated by Beydanes) denies that slavery exists in the country. According to Abdel Nasser Ould Ethmane, a political adviser to the African Union and a cofounder of the abolitionist group SOS Slaves, the Mauritanian government's \\"line\\" on slavery is: \\"Slavery no longer exists, and talk of it suggests manipulation by the West, an act of enmity toward Islam, or influence from the worldwide Jewish conspiracy.\\" Responding to accusations of human rights abuse, in 2012 the Mauritanian Minister of rural development, Brahim Ould M'Bareck Ould Med El Moctar, stated: > I must tell you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, > equality‚Äîof all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with > this government, this is in the past. There are probably former > relationships‚Äîslavery relationships and familial relationships from old days > and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to > be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial > reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But > (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in > Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can > tell you that no one profits from this commerce. In March 2013, the President established an agency to \\"combat slavery\\", known as the \\"National Agency to Fight against the Vestiges of Slavery, Integration, and Fight against Poverty\\".\\"Creating a National Agency for the Fight against the Legacy of Slavery \\" (21 March 2013), National Commission for Human Rights in Mauritania The director, Hamdi Ould Mahjoub, a Beydane, told The New Yorker author Alexis Okeowo, \\"Slavery as an institution, as something accepted by society, does not exist\\" in Mauritania, and that his agency was working on a program to help farmers and others to build clinics and improve access to water. Causes of persistence Among the reasons given for the difficulty of ending slavery in Mauritania are: * Many of the slaves are isolated by illiteracy, poverty, and geography, and do not know that life outside servitude is possible. * The difficulty of enforcing any laws in the country's vast desert.Slavery's last stronghold. CNN.com (16 March 2012). Retrieved 20 March 2012. * Poverty that limits opportunities for slaves to support themselves if freed. * Dependence on masters who provide food and clothing to slaves. * Difficulty of \\"running away\\" and leaving families in large parts of the country that are desert. * Belief that slavery is part of the natural order of this society. * Belief in an interpretation of Islam in which slaves are \\"told that their paradise is bound to their master and that if they do what the master tells them, they will go to heaven\\". * Mauritanian laws, which place the burden of proof on the slave, require that a victim file a complaint before an investigation is launched, and that human rights organisations may not file a case on behalf of a victim, despite the fact that most slaves are illiterate. Antislavery organizations Mauritanian antislavery organizations include: * Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement (IRA-Mauritania), is led by Biram Dah Abeid, a former slave * Al'Hor ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ± (translated as \\"the free\\") * In'itaq ÿ•ŸÜÿπÿ™ÿßŸÇ (translated as \\"emancipation\\") * SOS Esclaves (meaning \\"SOS Slaves\\" in French) aids slaves to escape from their masters, and petitions the government and the clergy to address the problem of slavery, but stops short of aggressively confronting authorities like IRA-Mauritania. SOS was co-founded by , a former slave who went on to study engineering and architecture in Mali and Moscow. As of 2014, he was in his late sixties and so, according to Messaoud, may represent an older generation. In 2011, Messaoud and Biram Dah Abeid held a hunger strike in a Nouakchott police station until the police put a slave owner in jail. Modern slavery According to the US State Department 2010 Human Rights Report,2010 Human Rights Report: Mauritania. State.gov (8 April 2011).

The 2010 report continued: \\"Government efforts were not sufficient to enforce the antislavery law. No cases have been successfully prosecuted under the antislavery law despite the fact that 'de facto' slavery exists in Mauritania.\\" One person, Oumoulmoumnine Mint Bakar Vall, has been prosecuted for owning slaves. She was sentenced to six months in jail in January 2011. According to the Global Slavery Index 2014 compiled by Walk Free Foundation, there are an estimated 155,600 enslaved people in Mauritania, ranking it 31st of 167 countries by absolute number of slaves, and 1st by prevalence, with 4% of the population. The Government ranks 121 of 167 in its response to combating all forms of modern slavery.Global Slavery Index 2014 http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/. Walk Free Foundation, p. 3 Retrieved 5 November 2014. According to the Mauritanian government, it has taken action to end all forms of slavery. In 2015, the government expanded the definition of slavery to include child labor, although they have difficulty enforcing anti- slavery laws. The government is underfunded and ill-equipped to deal with slavery.MAURITANIA 2016 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT. state.gov The government of Mauritania denies that slavery continues in the country. In a 2012 interview, the Mauritanian Minister of rural development, Brahim Ould M'Bareck Ould Med El Moctar, responded to accusations of human rights abuse by stating: > I must tell you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, > equality‚Äîof all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with > this government, this is in the past.

But > (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in > Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can > tell you that no one profits from this commerce. = French abolitionist policies = The French implemented abolitionist policies after their territories failed to comply with a law freeing all slaves. Mauritanian administrators told the French that slavery was a custom in Mauritania, and they could not simply abolish it without societal distress, so they enforced certain policies but still allowed slavery. Slaves in Mauritania were returned to their masters and treated as runaway children. Also, African men who were recruited into the French army, or tirailleurs were allowed to take slave wives, but they had to have been free before they were married, and had to stay in the colony. Tirailleurs could claim their children by proving they were not illegitimate, however if they were not they were slaves. The French established villages de libert√© or \\"liberty villages\\" so that slaves would have an area to be free in Mauritania. They could take refuge there and be taxed by the French. However, within 3 months the slave could be reclaimed by their masters, and the villages had little resources. Although the French liberated their other territories successfully, because Islam was so intertwined with slavery the French believed it would go against tradition to enforce abolition in Mauritania. The French also believed that ‚Äúslaves themselves were simply ‚Äònot ready‚Äô to be wrenched from their social security, to do so would be to ‚Äòsow social disorder‚Äô‚Äù. Subsequently, domestic slavery as well as colonial slavery was still permitted in Mauritania. = Other abolition issues = Obstacles to ending slavery in Mauritania include: * The difficulty of enforcing any laws in the country's vast desert * Poverty that limits opportunities for slaves to support themselves if freed * Belief that slavery is part of the natural order of this society. In November 2016, an appeals court in Mauritania overturned the jail convictions of three anti- slavery activists and reduced the sentences of seven others to time served leaving three in custody, for their alleged role in a riot in June, Amnesty International said. Another court had originally sentenced the 13 human rights activists and members of the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement (IRA) to 15 years in prison. Child labor also remains prevalent throughout Mauritania. The Mauritanian government conducted raid in Nouakchott in November 2017 and rescued forty-two child slaves who were held by Koranic instructors. According to the United States Department of Labor, the violation of child slavery laws is rarely punished. The Special Brigade for Minors investigated 406 case of child exploitation; however, it is unclear if the Mauritanian legal system further investigated or punished anyone involved in those particular cases. Child slavery continues to be an issue in Mauritania because the status is passed down maternally, from mother to child. = International pressure = As a result of Mauritania failing to curb slavery, in January 2018, the African Union officially reprimanded the Mauritanian government. The ruling was based on a case involving two brothers, Said Salem and Yarg Ould Salem who were slaves since birth. The African Union ordered Mauritania to compensate the two brothers, causing activists to claim that the ruling would lay the groundwork enforcing anti-slavery laws within the country. In 2015, the Mauritanian government expanded the definition of slavery to include child labor. Extreme poverty and Islamic norms discourage many slaves from attempting to escape. Racial and ethnic division plays a role in Mauritanian government and society, as most slaves in Mauritania are Black while the ruling class tend to be Arab. The international community is increasingly pressuring Mauritania to enforce its anti-slavery laws. Along with the African Union's recent ruling, the United States is considering downgrading its trade relations with Mauritania because of its poor record on enforcing its anti- slavery laws.

Intended to restore Latin domination, both civil and ecclesiastical, to Greece, it was forestalled by the War of the Sicilian Vespers, which diverted the resources of Charles to the recovery of Sicily. Background Charles had long aspired to assemble a trans-Mediterranean kingdom. A younger brother of the French king, Louis IX, he had enlarged his appanage of Provence by agreeing to act as the Papal champion against the Hohenstaufen in 1263. He was rewarded with the Kingdom of Sicily as a papal fief, and almost immediately began to look eastward for further lands. With the defeat of Manfred of Sicily in 1266, Charles sent an army to Albania to seize the dowry of Manfred's wife, Helena of Epirus. This brought Charles into conflict with Emperor Michael VIII in the Adriatic theater. Baldwin II of Courtenay, then titular Latin Emperor, made a natural ally. Driven out of Constantinople by Michael VIII in 1261, Baldwin was practically penniless and desperate for aid to regain his empire. Charles agreed, but at a significant price: the two signed the Treaty of Viterbo in 1267, wherein Charles agreed to help reconquer the Latin Empire in exchange for the suzerainty of Achaea and other important concessions. However, the invasion of Italy by Conradin and the Eighth Crusade combined to delay any intervention by Charles. Under Pope Gregory X, negotiations for the union of the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox Churches were initiated, and any move by Charles against Constantinople was forbidden. However, he was encouraged by the Pope to purchase the claim of Maria of Antioch to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1277, to which he sent a bailli to rule in his name. This was part of a papal strategy to preserve the Kingdom of Jerusalem by integrating it into a trans-Mediterranean empire allied with the French royal house, which would provide the necessary resource for the Kingdom's defense. In 1278, by a provision of the Treaty of Viterbo, the Principality of Achaea also came under his direct rule. The accession of Pope Martin IV, who was largely under Charles' influence, removed the last obstacle to Charles' ambitions. The new Pope declared the Union of the Churches a failure, clearing the way for Charles' plans of conquest. Like the Treaty of Viterbo, the new alliance against Constantinople would unite the arms of Charles and the dynast of the Latin Empire (now Philip of Courtenay, Baldwin II having died in 1273) under Papal sanction. Furthermore, the Venetians, who had played a key role in the Latin Empire but had not subscribed to the Treaty of Viterbo, were also to be brought into the alliance. Provisions Charles I of Sicily, one of the high contracting parties to the treaty. Like the Treaty of Viterbo, the new treaty was signed in the Papal palace, which Pope Martin IV had moved to Orvieto after Viterbo was placed under interdict for imprisoning two cardinals. Its stated purpose was the dethronement of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII in favor of Philip and the establishment of the Union of the Churches, bringing the Greek Orthodox Church under the authority of the Pope. Its practical motivation, however, was to re-establish the Latin Empire, under Angevin domination, and to restore Venetian commercial privileges in Constantinople. Under the terms of the treaty, Philip and Charles were to supply 8,000 troops and mounts, and sufficient ships to transport them to Constantinople. Philip, Dandolo, and Charles, or Charles' son, Charles, Prince of Salerno, were to personally accompany the expedition. In practice, Charles would have supplied almost all of the troops, Philip having little or no resources of his own. The Venetians would supply forty galleys as escorts for the invasion fleet, which was to sail from Brindisi no later than April 1283. Upon Philip's restoration to the throne, he was to confirm the concessions of the Treaty of Viterbo and the privileges granted to Venice at the founding of the Latin Empire, including recognition of the Doge as dominator of \\"one-fourth and one-eighth of the Latin Empire.\\" A second document was also drawn up to organize a vanguard to precede the main expedition of 1283. Charles and Philip were to supply fifteen ships and ten transports with about 300 men and horses. The Venetians were to provide fifteen warships for seven months of the year. These forces would make war against Michael VIII and \\"other occupiers\\" of the Latin Empire (presumably the Genoese), and would meet at Corfu by 1 May 1282, paving the way for the next year's invasion. The two treaties were signed by Charles and Philip on 3 July 1281. They were ratified by the Doge of Venice on 2 August 1281. Consequences A few weeks after the signing of the treaty, Pope Martin excommunicated Michael VIII. Provisions were duly made for the expedition, and a few skirmishes took place around Euboea. Nikephoros, the ruler of Epirus, also concluded a treaty with Charles, Philip, and Dandolo in September 1281. However, shortly before the expedition was to sail, the Sicilian Vespers broke out (30 March 1282). The resulting civil war split the Kingdom of Sicily in two, and Charles spent the rest of his life trying to quell it. His descendants would continue to maintain an ever more tenuous rule over parts of the Latin Empire, but no grand expedition against Constantinople was ever mounted.

Chicago-based Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, such as William F. Roemer, Jr., considered DeStefano to be the worst torture-murderer in the history of the United States.Roemer, Jr., William F., The Enforcer (1994), p.12 The Outfit used the mentally unstable and sadistic DeStefano for the torture-murders of Leo Foreman and Arthur Adler, the murder of DeStefano's younger brother, Michael DeStefano (an Outfit enforcer), and many others. However, due to DeStefano's deranged mental state, the Outfit never let him become a made man. At least one Outfit insider, Charles Crimaldi, claimed DeStefano was a devil worshipper. Early years Samuel DeStefano, Jr. was born in Streator, Illinois, into the Italian-American family of Samuel DeStefano, Sr., and Rosalie DeStefano (n√©e Brasco), both of whom had been born in Italy and had immigrated to the United States in 1903. Destefano, Sr., was a laborer and, later on in life, a grocer and real estate salesman who died of natural causes in 1942, at age 77. Rosalie was a housewife, who throughout her life was supported by the contributions of her children. She died in October 1960. In all, the DeStefanos had seven children, three sons and four daughters. Not long after his birth, Sam DeStefano and his family moved to Herrin, Illinois, where his father worked in the local coal mine. After the labor-related turmoil surrounding the Herrin Massacre, the DeStefano family moved north to Chicago's Little Italy. One of the earliest reports on DeStefano is from September 12, 1926, when he was arrested in Chicago and turned over to the Niles Police Department as a fugitive for breaking out of jail. On July 1, 1927, several hundred Westside gang members showed up threatening violence against a police sergeant for arresting DeStefano and shooting DeStefano's associate Harry Casgrovi. In November 1927, DeStefano and fellow gang member Ralph Orlando were in court on charges of assaulting a 17-year-old girl. The prosecution claimed that on August 19, 1927, the girl was forced into an automobile and driven to a garage where she was sexually assaulted by seven men. Orlando and DeStefano were both found guilty of rape; Orlando was sentenced to ten years while DeStefano was sentenced to three. The reason for the lighter sentence was that police arrived before DeStefano had the opportunity to rape the girl. In 1930, DeStefano joined the Forty-Two Gang, an infamous Chicago street gang led by future Outfit boss, Salvatore \\"Sam\\" Giancana. DeStefano soon became involved in bootlegging and gambling. In 1932, he was wounded by a policeman during a grocery store robbery. In August of that year, DeStefano appeared at a hospital on Chicago's West Side with bullet wounds, which he refused to explain. In 1933, DeStefano was convicted of a bank robbery in New Lisbon, Wisconsin and sentenced to 40 years in prison. His sentence was commuted by Governor Julius Heil in December 1942 and he was released in December 1944. DeStefano returned to prison in June 1947 for possessing counterfeit sugar ration stamps. While in Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary in the 1940s DeStefano met Outfit members Paul Ricca and Louis Campagna. Later in 1947, DeStefano was released and obtained a civil service job in Chicago as a garbage dump foreman. In 1952, city officials discovered DeStefano had omitted his criminal record from his Civil Service application; however, they chose not to prosecute him. He married his wife Jeanie Rose Weldrin in a private New York ceremony in 1932. He was known to be abusive and controlling towards his wife often beating or raping her if she didn‚Äôt do exactly as he asked. At one point he kidnapped a man at gun point and forced him to rape Jeanie. They have six children together: their daughters Beanie, Roberta, Alexia and Eljean, and their sons Donald and Bertie. All went into hiding after their father's death.  Crimes  =Political fixing= During the early 1950s, DeStefano became one of the most prominent loan shark operators in Chicago. Using stolen money from his days as a bank robber, DeStefano began investing in Chicago real estate. He bought a 24-suite apartment building and used the rent money as legitimate income to bribe local aldermen and other politicians. By the mid-1950s, DeStefano's influence extended to city officials, prominent judges, and law enforcement officers. DeStefano would brag \\"there wasn't any case he couldn't 'fix,'\\" and began offering his services accordingly. His fees ranged from $800 for fixing a robbery case to $1,500 for an assault case. DeStefano allegedly fixed a first- degree murder case for $20,000. DeStefano's arrangements became so routine, corrupt police officers would escort suspects to DeStefano's house. After DeStefano paid off the cops, the suspects would be \\"put on the juice\\" to DeStefano in exchange for his assistance. =Loan sharking= By the early 1960s, DeStefano was a leading loan shark for the Outfit. DeStefano's loan shark victims included politicians, lawyers and small-time criminals; by the end of the decade, DeStefano was charging 20% to 25% a week in interest. DeStefano would accept very high-risk debtors, such as drug addicts or business men who had already defaulted on previous debts. The reason was simple: DeStefano enjoyed when debtors did not pay on time, since he could then bring them to the sound-proof torture chamber he'd built in his basement. Other gangsters said the sadistic DeStefano would actually foam at the mouth while torturing his victims. From time to time, DeStefano would also kill debtors who owed him small sums just to scare other debtors into paying their bigger debts. DeStefano would give his loan shark victims presents, such as a gold watch with his name engraved on the back, so that if he had to kill his victim and the police accused him he could use the watch as proof of how close he was to the victim and why he could never have killed him. He wore thick black rimmed glasses, making people believe he couldn't see without them, when in truth he could see everything that was going on and would take mental notes on how people operated. Under normal circumstances, the Outfit would have distanced itself from DeStefano due to his sadistic, irrational behavior. However, the bosses tolerated DeStefano because he earned them a great deal of money. DeStefano was such a successful earner, Giancana and Tony Accardo invested some of their own money in DeStefano's loansharking operations. Following a negative report in the Chicago Tribune by reporter William Doherty, DeStefano assaulted Doherty, chased him with a gun, threatened his family and finally broke the windows on Doherty's nearby parked car. =Acts of violence= In November 1963, DeStefano had a violent argument with Leo Foreman, a real estate agent and one of DeStefano's \\"juice-loan\\" collectors,Roemer, Jr., William F., The Enforcer (1994) p.39 in Foreman's office. DeStefano was physically ejected by Foreman from his office, and then he went into hiding. Later on, DeStefano underlings Tony Spilotro and Chuck Crimaldi contacted Foreman and said DeStefano wanted to let \\"bygones be bygones\\". Foreman was lured to DeStefano's brother's house and was murdered soon after. In another incident, Peter Cappelletti, a collector for DeStefano, fled Chicago with $25,000 from a loan shark victim. DeStefano's men located Cappelletti in Wisconsin and brought him back to Chicago. DeStefano chained Cappelletti to a radiator and tortured him for three days. While a banquet was going on, Cappelletti was secretly being tortured in the back of the restaurant. \\"Kill me man, please, I'm on fire!\\" Cappelletti implored, to which DeStefano replied \\"Then we need to put the fire out\\" before having his men drag the severely burned Cappelletti into the dining area and forcing the man's family to urinate on him in unison. Following the banquet, the family quickly paid back the stolen money. Behavior In January 1950, DeStefano bought a new car, in which police later spotted him driving around with a sign on it, reading \\"This is a lemon\\". To make sure everyone would notice it, he also festooned the car with grapefruits. DeStefano's reason for this was because that he thought he had bought a bad car and wanted the world to know it. In 1962, DeStefano was arrested after he tried to represent Vito Zaccagonini in a forgery trial in Rockford, Illinois. He later demanded the names of all employees in the state's attorney's and sheriff's offices so that they could be called as witnesses at his subsequent trial. During another court date in Rockford, when he was serving as his own lawyer as was his practice, he confused everyone in the courtroom when he approached the jury and asked, \\"Have you ever seen an elephant?\\" Moments later, DeStefano suddenly changed his plea to guilty, telling the jury, \\"something had come to light that I had not known before.\\" The jury found him guilty and fined him $100 for disorderly conduct. He would say it was his dream in life to own a pig farm so he could feed his victims to the pigs. He even drove to pig farms just to watch them for hours. According to hitman-turned-informant Charles Crimaldi, DeStefano once forced his wife Anita to take his gun and put the end of the barrel in her mouth, then demanded that she pull the trigger. When she pulled the trigger and the gun didn't go off, DeStefano began to laugh and told her he had removed the bullets. He would tell this story repeatedly to his mob associates for amusement. FBI Agent William F. Roemer wrote of going to DeStefano's house to question him about mob business, saying that several times, DeStefano would walk down the stairs in his pajamas, exposing himself. Often DeStefano's wife would serve the agents coffee and the agents would comment that the coffee had a unique taste to it. DeStefano would claim that the coffee was made from special Italian coffee beans that his wife brewed. Months later Roemer found out DeStefano had been urinating in the coffee before serving it to the agents. Roemer wrote that he could never drink coffee again. DeStefano's partner in the drug dealing business was rogue cop Tommy Dorso. Dorso said he once saw DeStefano roll on the floor, with spit running from his mouth, begging Satan to show him mercy and screaming over and over again, \\"I'm your servant; command me.\\" Once, while riding in his car, DeStefano saw a man walking down a Chicago street. He forced the man into his car at gunpoint, took the man to his house and forced the man and his own wife to have sex with each other, all for some real or imagined grievance that DeStefano had with his wife. Afterward, the man was so mortified that he would be accused of rape, he went to the nearest police station and reported the incident. One informant who was close to DeStefano described him as a highly emotional, temperamental individual, extremely egotistical and concerned with his personal appearance. The walls of his home were lined with mirrors and as DeStefano talked to people, he constantly watched his reflection in the mirrors as he walked across the room. He was described as being of such a temperament that he could be crying at one moment and laughing the very next. DeStefano would often state that if he had not been framed for rape at age 17, he would have become President of the United States.Dark, Tony. A Mob of His Own: Samuel Mad Sam DeStefano and the Chicago Mob's Juice Rackets, H.H. Productions, Chicago, 2008. Later life In 1965, DeStefano was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to three to five years in prison. On February 22, 1972, DeStefano was sentenced to three and one half years in prison for threatening the life of a witness, mobster turned informant Charles Crimaldi, an accomplice in the Foreman murder. DeStefano had encountered Crimaldi in the elevator of the Chicago Dirksen Federal Building and threatened him. Later in 1972, DeStefano was indicted on federal charges for illegal possession of firearms by a felon. DeStefano and his associates were eventually indicted for the Foreman murder. As in his previous trials, DeStefano had raised a large amount of public interest with his bizarre behavior. He made demands to represent himself, dressed in pajamas, shouted through bullhorns, and rambled incoherently. DeStefano then started displaying similar behavior in the Foreman trial. The Outfit bosses began to worry DeStefano was not only jeopardizing his own defense, but also the defenses of his other crew members. In a secret meeting, the boss of the Chicago Outfit, Tony Accardo, gave DeStefano's crew permission to kill him. On April 14, 1973, it was presumed that DeStefano was to have met with his brother, Mario Anthony DeStefano, and associate Tony Spilotro in the garage of his Galewood neighborhood home, in the 1600 block of North Sayre Avenue. Before the meeting began, Spilotro allegedly entered the lot and shot DeStefano twice with a shotgun, hitting him in the chest and tearing his left arm off at the elbow, instantly killing him. The murderer was never brought to trial.Roemer, Jr., William F., The Enforcer (1994), p.90Roemer, Jr., William F., Accardo: The Genuine Godfather (1995), p.271 References Bibliography *Devito, Carlo.

A longtime gambler with numerous minor convictions for illegal gambling, DiCocco was connected to New York's underworld. He also controlled racketeering and other criminal activities with Carmine Galante in Montreal, Canada. DiCocco also had contacts in New York's labor unions; he and Nicholas Robilotto, President of Teamsters Local #294 in Albany, New York were eventually investigated for conspiring to underbid rival construction companies. DiCocco owned a luncheonette with his brother that was renowned for its Italian cuisine. In 1951, DiCocco was investigated by a grand jury on charges of corruption and illegal gambling in Schenectady County, New York. This investigation resulted from allegations that Schenectady Police Chief Joseph A. Peters fixed a traffic ticket for DiCocco. Peters denied the charge, but was eventually forced to resign. Receiving a subpoena from Mayor Samuel S. Stratton, DiCocco appeared before a City Hall investigation on his supposed ties to organized crime. During a half-hour period, DiCocco pleaded the Fourth and Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitutions to the U.S. Constitution over 76 times. In 1977, DiCocco was indicted on contempt and perjury charges. Shortly after his first trial ended in a hung jury, DiCocco accepted a plea bargain to obstructing governmental administration and contempt. DiCocco received three years probation and a $1,000 fine. Paul had ties in Syracuse, New York with prominent business owners. He is related to the DiCocco, Tessitore, Iovinella, Cuomo and Viscusi families. In 1988, DiCocco was released from probation due to bad health. On July 30, 1989, Paul DiCocco Sr. died from complications from a previous heart transplant. Further reading *United States. Congress.

He used his profits to purchase sports properties, including the New York Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates of the National Hockey League (NHL), as well as the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National Football League. He eventually was brought down by the U.S. government through legal actions, leaving Dwyer penniless at the end of his life in 1946. Early life and Prohibition Born and raised in Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, Dwyer became one of the leading bootleggers during the early years of Prohibition. In his heyday he reportedly ran a fleet of 20 rum-runners. Dwyer was working as a dockyard stevedore (hired by friend George Shevlin) prior to the announcement of the Volstead Act in 1919. With access to company supply trucks, garages, and other valuable resources, Dwyer quickly dominated bootlegging in Manhattan within a year. His network of garages was able to hide large numbers of supply trucks which, accessible only by secret doors and compartments, were known only to Dwyer and several others. Eventually breaking away from Shevlin, Dwyer had organized a smuggling operation which ran from Europe directly to Manhattan. Forming a partnership with Owney Madden and, later Frank Costello, Dwyer soon began taking on future gangsters such as lieutenant Vannie Higgins and others. Through James J. Hines, Dwyer was able to gain the political protection of Tammany Hall as well as members of the New York police and Coast Guard enabling Dwyer's shipments to be delivered to the coast without interference. However, in 1925, Dwyer was arrested for attempting to bribe members of the Coast Guard during an undercover operation by the Prohibition Bureau and was sentenced for two years. After thirteen months, Dwyer was released for good behavior and slowly began to withdraw from bootlegging instead investing his money into legitimate businesses including legalized gambling ventures such as casinos and racetracks as well as sports teams owning a football team and two ice hockey teams. By the end of Prohibition in 1932, Dwyer had retired from bootlegging and lived with his wife and five children in Belle Harbor, Queens. He died there in 1946, aged 63, of a heart attack. Entry into professional sports In 1925, Tex Rickard convinced Dwyer to purchase the Hamilton Tigers of the National Hockey League and he renamed them the New York Americans. Dwyer paid $75,000 to turn the Tigers into the New York Americans. With a fortune made in Prohibition bootlegging, Dwyer handed out lucrative contracts, including a three-year deal to Billy Burch rumored to be worth $25,000. Shorty Green also received a huge raise, his salary going from $3,000 to $5,000. This was a time when most NHL players were said to make about $1,500 or $2,000. He took an active role in owning the team, often trying to rig NHL games. For example, he put a goal judge in that would call a goal against an opponent merely if the puck touched the goal line. It happened one night in 1927-28 when Ottawa was at Madison Square Garden. However, the goal judge seemed more interested in taunting Ottawa goalkeeper Alex Connell. Connell finally butt-ended the goal judge in the nose, which caused Dwyer's buddies to seek Connell's death that night. It took a police detail to get Connell out of the Gardens that night and at the train station, someone inquired if a gentleman was Alex Connell. Connell lied and said he was not, knowing he was in danger. The Americans flourished, and Dwyer secretly purchased the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NHL, using ex-boxer Benny Leonard as the front man who appeared to be the team's owner. The team folded in 1930 as the Philadelphia Quakers. In 1930, Dwyer also purchased the NFL's Dayton Triangles for $2,500, relocated them to Ebbets Field and renamed them the Brooklyn Dodgers. He bought the team with Jack Depler, a former player for the NFL's Orange Tornadoes. By the end of the 1932 season, Dwyer had enough of professional football. The Dodgers, had cost him an estimated $30,000 in just three years. The team was then purchased by two former New York Giants players, Chris Cagle and John Simms Kelly for $25,000. In 1935-36, the United States government won a big lawsuit against Dwyer, leaving him virtually penniless except for his ownership of the Americans, and he was losing money here, also. Just before the 1936-37 season, the NHL took control of the Americans, claiming that the financial status of the team was critical. Dwyer filed a lawsuit against the NHL for this, but the NHL settled by letting him own the Americans in 1936-37 to give him time to pay his debts. Red Dutton, who was manager and coach of the team, lent Bill $20,000 for the team and Dwyer promptly lost it all in a craps game.Frayne, p.73 When, at the end of the season, he could not pay the debts he owed, the NHL ordered the team under its control. Thoroughbred racetrack ownership In 1929, Dwyer acquired the Coney Island Race Track in Cincinnati, Ohio. He allowed operations through bootlegging partner, Arthur \\"Dutch Schultz\\" Flegenheimer in 1934 and 1935. Dwyer cut a deal with Ed Strong of Cleveland for Peter Horback to purchase the race track which was in receivership on July 20th, 1936 for a $5,000.00 down payment. On September 1st, 1936, the deal was finalized and paid in full, in the amount ofhttps://wordpress.com/view/deathvalleyfarmcincinnatibootleggingandprohibition.wordpress.com $95,000.00. The same day the track was sold by Peter Horback to River Downs Inc. of Cleveland, Ohio. In 1931, Bill Dwyer became a founding partner in the Tropical Park Race Track in Coral Gables, Florida.

Fitzpatrick had joined the Five Points Gang under Paul Kelly (born Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli) in the late 1890s. During the Kelly-Eastman gang war in 1903, Fitzpatrick defected to the Eastman Gang, along with \\"Kid Twist\\" Max Zwerbach; they both became top lieutenants. After Monk Eastman was arrested and imprisoned in 1904, Fitzpatrick and Zwerbach began fighting over leadership of the Eastman gang, eventually splitting the gang into separate factions. On November 1, 1904 while attending a peace conference at a Sheriff Street saloon in the New York Chrystie Street neighborhood, Fitzpatrick was shot to death before the peace talks began. His killer was suspected of being Harris Dahl, aka Kid Dahl, friend of arch-rival Kid Twist. Several weeks later, \\"Kid Twist\\" lieutenant Vach \\"Cyclone Louie\\" Lewis led an attack that resulted in the murders of the remainder of the Fitzpatrick faction. Popular culture Fitzpatrick was said to use a strategy of ambushing opponents by setting up meetings and claiming to be ready to turn against his leader. After being searched, he would excuse himself to use the restroom, where he had stashed a gun. Returning to the main room, he would kill his opponent.

An associate of Arnold Rothstein during prohibition, he was caught up in a power struggle following Rothstein's death. Fellow Rothstein associates Charles Luciano and Meyer Lansky provided authorities with evidence that led to his imprisonment for ten years. Youth and early career He was born Irving Wexler to Polish Jewish immigrant parents in New York's Lower East Side on January 19, 1888. Gordon became known as a pickpocket and sneak thief as a child, becoming so successful he earned the nickname \\"Waxey\\" for supposedly being so skilled in picking pockets it was as if his victims' wallets were lined with wax. In 1914, he participated in a gang fight that resulted in the death of a court clerk named Samuel Straus. Wexler was put on trial for the crime but acquitted by a jury in February 1917. Joining \\"Dopey\\" Benny Fein's labor sluggers in the early 1910s Gordon helped organize Fein's operations before being noticed by Arnold Rothstein, who hired him away from Fein and put him to work as a rum-runner during the first years of Prohibition. Prohibition and decline Gordon's success later led him to run all of Rothstein's bootlegging on most of the east coast, specifically New York and New Jersey, and importing large amounts of Canadian whisky over the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. Gordon, now earning an estimated $2 million a year, began buying numerous breweries and distilleries as well as owning several speakeasies. Gordon began to be known to live extravagantly, traveling in limousines and living in prominent Manhattan hotel suites, as well as owning mansions built for him in New York and Philadelphia. Rothstein died in 1928 and Gordon's position began to decline. He made an alliance with future National Crime Syndicate founders Charles Luciano, Louis Buchalter, and Meyer Lansky. Gordon, however, constantly fought with Lansky over bootlegging and gambling interests and soon a gang war began between the two; several associates on each side were killed. Lansky, with Luciano, supplied interim United States Attorney Thomas E. Dewey with information leading to Gordon's conviction on charges of tax evasion in 1933. Gordon had a large million- dollar operation that included many trucks, buildings, processing plants, and associated employees and his business front could not account for this ownership and cash flow and he paid no taxes on it. Gordon was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. At this time he was married to a rabbi's daughter and their son was in medical school. This son died in a weather-related automobile accident while traveling from an out-of-town college planning to plead with the judge for leniency with his father's sentence. Gordon had tried to insulate his otherwise respectable family from his organized crime career and the incident greatly shocked their relations, and great stress was put on the deteriorating marriage. Later career Upon Gordon's release from prison, he found his gang long since disbanded. Ignored by his former political connections, he reportedly remarked to a journalist, \\"Waxey Gordon is dead. Meet Irving Wexler, salesman.\\" He moved to California, a single man, and during World War II he was able to obtain 10,000 lbs of scarce, coupon- rationed sugar to sell on the black market. FBI investigations revealed he had high-level international narcotics connections, and was given the U.S. West Coast as a protected territory for distribution of imported illegal drugs since he lost his bootlegging business on the East Coast. In 1951, Gordon was arrested for selling heroin to an undercover police officer. The 62-year-old gangster reportedly offered the detective all his money in exchange for his release. When the detective refused, Gordon jokingly pleaded with the detective to kill him instead of arresting him for \\"peddling junk.\\" Gordon was later convicted, and due to his long criminal record was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment in Alcatraz, where he died of a heart attack on June 24, 1952.

As attempting to score runs quickly involves playing more aggressive shots and thus an increased likelihood of being dismissed, it is generally considered unwise for a top-order batsman to attempt this. Therefore, a lower-order batsman (such as a bowler) is sometimes promoted. There is less importance placed on his wicket, so he can play with more freedom. This is an important tactic in One Day International cricket, with its occurrence in Test cricket far less regular. The term was relatively recently introduced to cricket, and was unfamiliar to many cricket followers before the 1992 World Cup. New Zealand employed a slightly different form of the tactic to considerable effect with Mark Greatbatch playing the pinch- hitting role. This was among other innovative tactics New Zealand employed successfully during the round-robin stage to reach the knockout stage. It has since been used throughout limited overs cricket, with the aggressive batsmen known as \\"pinch-hitters.\\" However, \\"pinch hitter\\" usually refers to an aggressive batsman moved up the batting order from his usual place, used in situations where scoring runs quickly becomes more important than keeping wickets in hand. Pinch hitters are known for their big hitting and high strike rates. However, they sometimes lack the technique of higher-class batsmen and therefore often go out for low scores through their excessive attacking. This is not the same as a \\"nightwatchman\\" used in Test and first-class matches.

Biography At the age of thirteen, according to the custom of the German Talmudists of that epoch, Judah began to travel. He set out for Spain July 18, 1283, and arrived at Toledo April 7, 1285, consuming almost two years in his journey. He does not appear to have stayed long in Toledo, for in 1286 he married the daughter of his oldest brother, Jehiel, who is not known to have left Germany before 1305. After her death he married the daughter of Solomon, another brother of his. In 1305 his father, who was then obliged to leave Germany, sent Judah before him into Spain in order to arrange for his settling there. Judah says in his testament that when he first came to Toledo he could not profit much by the Spanish Talmudists, as he understood neither their writing nor their language; and as he had sore eyes he could not even occupy himself with writing. After his father's death (1321 or 1328) Judah was chosen by the Toledo community as his successor in the rabbinate. He was held in great esteem by the members of his congregation, and when, on account of some disagreement, he manifested a desire to remove to Seville, they urged him to remain and doubled his salary. Still, he was not favorably inclined toward Spain; for he recommended his five sons to emigrate to Germany, his native country. Asher, Judah's father, had ordained that every member of his family should give for charitable purposes a tithe of his earnings, and that three-fourths of the amount of such tithe should be confided to two trustees for distribution among the poor. In the agreement signed by Asher and his sons on October 20, 1314, Judah and his brother Jacob were appointed trustees. Judah approved heartily of this charitable institution, and at his request, on September 18, 1346, his sons signed an agreement making a similar arrangement in regard to the disposition of their own earnings.Bet Talmud, iv. 377 Judah died at Toledo July 4, 1349. Works Judah was a recognized authority on Halakha, and his responsa, together with a fragment of his commentary on Shabbat, were published, under the title of Zikron Yehudah, by David Cassel (Berlin, 1846).

It is an ester formed from the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid and glycerol. It is present at relatively high levels in the central nervous system, with cannabinoid neuromodulatory effects. It has been found in maternal bovine and human milk. The chemical was first described in 1994-1995, although it had been discovered some time before that. The activities of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) mediate its formation. 2-AG is synthesized from arachidonic acid-containing diacylglycerol (DAG). Occurrence 2-AG, unlike anandamide (another endocannabinoid), is present at relatively high levels in the central nervous system; it is the most abundant molecular species of monoacylglycerol found in mouse and rat brain (~5-10 nmol/g tissue). Detection of 2-AG in brain tissue is complicated by the relative ease of its isomerization to 1-AG during standard lipid extraction conditions. It has been found in maternal bovine as well as human milk.The Endocannabinoid-CB Receptor System: Importance for development and in pediatric disease Neuroendocrinology Letters Nos.1/2, Feb-Apr Vol.25, 2004.Cannabinoids and Feeding: The Role of the Endogenous Cannabinoid System as a Trigger for Newborn Suckling Women and Cannabis: Medicine, Science, and Sociology, 2002 The Haworth Press, Inc.

Longevity Medicine Review. Retrieved 2011-05-26. 2-AG was a known chemical compound but its occurrence in mammals and its affinity for the cannabinoid receptors were first described in 1994-1995. A research group at Teikyo University reported the affinity of 2-AG for the cannabinoid receptors in 1994-1995,Sugiura T, Itoh K, Waku K, Hanahan DJ (1994) Proceedings of Japanese conference on the Biochemistry of Lipids, 36, 71-74 (in Japanese) but the isolation of 2-AG in the canine gut was first reported in 1995 by the research group of Raphael Mechoulam at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which additionally characterized its pharmacological properties in vivo. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol, next with Anandamide, was the second endocannabinoid discovered. The cannabinoid established the existence of a cannabinoid neuromodulatory system in the nervous system. Pharmacology Unlike anandamide, formation of 2-AG is calcium-dependent and is mediated by the activities of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). 2-AG acts as a full agonist at the CB1 receptor. At a concentration of 0.3nM, 2-AG induces a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free calcium in NG108-15 neuroblastoma X glioma cells through a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism. 2-AG is hydrolyzed in vitro by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the uncharacterized serine hydrolase enzymes ABHD6 and ABHD12. The exact contribution of each of these enzymes to the termination of 2-AG signaling in vivo is unknown, though it is estimated that MAGL is responsible for ~85% of this activity in the brain. There have been identified transport proteins for 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide. These include the heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs). Biosynthesis 2-Arachidonoylglycerol is synthesized from arachidonic acid- containing diacylglycerol (DAG), which is derived from the increase of inositol phospholipid metabolism by the action of diacylglycerol lipase. The molecule can also be formed from pathways like the hydrolysis derived (by diglyceride) from both phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidic acid (PAs) by the action of DAG lipase and the hydrolysis of arachidonic acid-containing lysophosphatidic acid by the action of a phosphatase.

The basic story goes as follows: > Four men entered the pardes ‚Äî Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, Acher, and Rabbi Akiva. > Ben Azzai looked and died; Ben Zoma looked and went mad; Acher destroyed the > plants; Akiva entered in peace and departed in peace.Babylonian Talmud > Hagigah 14b, Jerusalem Talmud Hagigah 9:1. Both available online in Aramaic: > Babylonian Talmud, Jerusalem Talmud. This translation based on Braude, > Ginzberg, Rodkinson, and Streane. Etymology The Hebrew word ◊§÷∑÷º◊®÷∞◊ì÷µ÷º◊° (pardes 'orchard') is of Persian origin (cf Avestan ê¨ûê¨Äê¨åê¨≠ê¨å‚∏±ê¨õê¨Äê¨âê¨∞ê¨Ä)◊û◊ô◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊©◊û◊ß◊ï◊®◊ü ◊ë◊§◊®◊°◊ô◊™ and appears several times in the Bible. Persian is also the source of the word paradise, which entered English via Latin paradisus and Greek œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ¥ŒµŒπœÉŒøœÇ.paradise (n.) Account The story is found in several places, with minor variations: the Tosefta,Tosefta Hagigah 2:2 the Babylonian Talmud,Hagigah 14b and the Jerusalem Talmud.Jerusalem Talmud Hagigah 2:1 The original context in the Tosefta is the restriction on transmitting mystical teaching concerning the divine Chariot except privately to particularly qualified disciples. The version in the Babylonian Talmud, which is the best-known, may be translated: > The Rabbis taught: Four entered the Pardes. They were Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, > Acher and Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva said to them, \\"When you come to the place > of pure marble stones, do not say, 'Water! Water!' for it is said, 'He who > speaks untruths shall not stand before My eyes'Psalms 101:7\\". Ben Azzai > gazed and died. Regarding him the verse states, 'Precious in the eyes of G-d > is the death of His pious ones'.Psalms 116:15 Ben Zoma gazed and was harmed. > Regarding him the verse states, 'Did you find honey? Eat as only much as you > need, lest you be overfilled and vomit it'.Proverbs 25:16 Acher cut down the > plantings. Rabbi Akiva entered in peace and left in peace.Babylonian Talmud > Hagigah 14b Versions of the story also appear in the esoteric Hekhalot literature.David J. Halperin, A new edition of the Hekhalot literature (Review of Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur by Peter Sch√§fer), Journal of the American Oriental Society 104(3):543-552. Exposition Rashi says that Ben Azzai died from looking at the Divine Presence. Ben Zoma's harm was in losing his sanity. Acher's \\"cutting down the plantings\\" in the orchard refers to becoming a heretic from the experience. Acher means \\"the other one\\", and is the Talmudic term for the sage Elisha ben Avuya. Rabbi Akiva, in contrast to the other three, became the leading Rabbinic figure of the era. Rashi explains that the four rabbis ascended to Heaven by utilizing the Divine Name, which might be understood as achieving a spiritual elevation through Jewish meditation practices. The Tosafot, medieval commentaries on the Talmud, say that the four sages \\"did not go up literally, but it appeared to them as if they went up.\\"A. W. Streane, A Translation of the Treatise Chagigah from the Babylonian Talmud (Cambridge University Press, 1891). p. 83. On the other hand, Rabbi Louis Ginzberg wrote that the journey to paradise \\"is to be taken literally and not allegorically\\".Louis Ginzberg, \\"Elisha ben Abuyah\\", Jewish Encyclopedia, 1901-1906. According to another interpretation, PaRDeS-exegesis is an acronym for the 4 traditional methods of exegesis in Judaism. In this sense, they were the four to understand the whole Torah. =Interpretation in Kabbalah= Another version of the legend is also found in the mystical literature (Zohar I, 26b and Tikunei HaZohar 40), which adds to the story: > The ancient Saba (an old man) stood up and said (to Shimon bar Yochai), > \\"Rabbi, Rabbi! What is the meaning of what Rabbi Akiva said to his students, > \\"When you come to the place of pure marble stones, do not say 'Water! > Water!' lest you place yourselves in danger, for it is said, 'He who speaks > untruths shall not stand before My eyes.'\\" But it is written, 'There shall > be a firmament between the waters and it shall separate between water (above > the firmament) and water (below the firmament)' (Genesis 1:6). Since the > Torah describes the division of the waters in to upper and lower, why should > it be problematic to mention this division? Furthermore, since there are > upper and lower waters why did Rabbi Akiva warn them, \\"do not say, 'Water! > Water!'\\"\\" > > The Holy Lamp (a title for Shimon bar Yochai) replied, \\"Saba, it is proper > that you reveal this secret that the chevraya (Rabbi Shimon's circle of > disciples) have not grasped clearly.\\" > > The ancient Saba answered, \\"Rabbi, Rabbi, Holy Lamp. Surely the pure marble > stones are the letter yud - one the upper yud of the letter aleph, and one > the lower yud of the letter aleph. Here there is no spiritual impurity, only > pure marble stones, so there is no separation between one water and the > other; they form a single unity from the aspect of the Tree of Life, which > is the vav in the midst of the letter aleph. In this regard it states, 'and > if he take of the Tree of Life (and eat and live forever)' (Genesis > 3:22)...\\" from ascentofsafed.com Moshe Cordovero explains the Zoharic passage in his Pardes Rimonim (\\"Orchard of Pomegranates\\"), whose title itself refers to the Pardes mystical ascent (Pardes: Shaar Arachei HaKinuim, entry on Mayim-Water). The meaning of the ascent is understood through Rabbi Akiva's warning. The danger concerns misinterpreting anthropomorphism in Kabbalah, introducing corporeal notions in the Divine. Emanations in Kabbalah bridge between the Ein Sof Divine Unity and the plurality of Creation. The fundamental mystical error involves separating between Divine transcendence and Divine immanence, as if they were a duality. Rather, all Kabbalistic emanations have no being of their own, but are nullified and dependent on their source of vitality in the One God. Nonetheless, Kabbalah maintains that God is revealed through the life of His emanations, Man interacting with Divinity in a mutual Flow of \\"Direct Light\\" from Above to Below and \\"Returning Light\\" from Below to Above. The Sephirot, including Wisdom, Compassion and Kingship comprise the dynamic life in God's Persona. In the highest of the Four Worlds (Atzilut-Emanation), the complete nullification and Unity of the sephirot and Creation is revealed within its Divine source. Apparent separation only pertains, in successive degrees, to the lower Three Worlds and our Physical Realm. Introducing false separation causes the exile of the Shekhina Divine Presence within Creation from God. From Cordovero's explanation: > The meaning of Rabbi Akiva's warning is that the Sages should not declare > that there are two types of water, since there are not, lest you endanger > yourself because of the sin of separation...The marble stones represent the > letter ◊ô yud...a yud at the beginning, and a yud at the end...The first is > Wisdom, the second Kingship, which is also Wisdom according to the light > that returns from Below to Above. The upper is the yud of the Tetragrammaton > (first letter), while the lower is the yud of Adonai (last letter). The > latter is \\"female waters\\", and the former is \\"male waters\\"...the inner and > outer aspects...signified by the top and the bottom yuds of the letter ◊ê > aleph...Each is a stone because its shape is round. White \\"marble\\" indicates > Compassion, similar to \\"waters of kindness\\"...Wisdom is ◊ô◊© \\"Yesh\\" Being. > Kinship is ◊©◊ô \\"Shay\\" (reversed).

The firmament between them ◊ï (letter Vav in > the ◊ê aleph), which is Compassion, unites them...There is no separation > other than in a place of spiritual impurity, but \\"Here there is no > impurity...the Tree of Life\\" in Atzilut.

The company has its administrative base at the Mamdani Opera Centre, a facility in the Wesley United Church, since July 2005. The company gives its seasonal mainstage productions at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium. During the summer, the company presents 'Opera in the Village', the only Canadian outdoor summer opera festival. History The company was founded in 1972 as the Southern Alberta Opera Association. The association initially performed two opera productions per year, from 1973 to 1977. Alexander Gray was the first artistic director of the Southern Alberta Opera Association, and held the post until 1976. In 1976, the association appointed Brian Hanson as both its general manager and artistic director. During Hanson's tenure, the association expanded its season to three productions per season, beginning in 1978. Hanson described his general philosophy of programming operas for the company as \\"something old, something new, something light\\". In 1983, the Southern Alberta Opera Association officially changed its name to the Calgary Opera. The company presented further expanded seasons of four productions in 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988. Hanson retired from his posts in 1988. David Speers, previously the assistant general manager of the company, succeeded Hanson in 1988. The company staged five operas in 1990, and four operas in 1991. Speers concluded his tenure in 1998. In 1998, W.R. ('Bob') McPhee became general director of Calgary Opera. The company staged four productions in 2001, 2002 and 2004. From July 2004 to September 2005, the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium was shuttered for renovations. The company established its Emerging Artist Development Program in 2004, and received support of $375K (CDN) from the Canada Arts Training Fund over the period from 2010 to 2013. The 'Opera in the Village' programme began during McPhee's tenure. In March 2015, the company announced a partnership with the Calgary Stampede that is to lead to the eventual construction of a new opera centre for the company, on land provided by the Calgary Stampede. McPhee retired as the company's general director on 3 March 2017, because of health issues. Taras Kulish and Lauren Martin subsequently served as interim leaders of the company. In December 2017, the company announced the appointment of Keith Cerny as its next general director, effective January 2018. In August 2018, the company announced that Cerny is to stand down as its general director in January 2019. Gordon Gerrard was the company's resident conductor and r√©p√©titeur for four seasons, beginning in 2009. Christopher ('Topher') Mokrzewski succeeded Gerrard as resident conductor and repetiteur with the company in 2013. In October 2017, the company announced the appointment of Kimberley-Ann Bartczak as its next resident conductor and repetiteur. Bartczak is the first female conductor to be named to this post. New work Calgary Opera has commissioned and/or presented several new operas by Canadian composers, including the following: * Allan Gordon Bell and Rick McNair: Turtle Wakes (2001; one-act opera for young audiences) * John Estacio and John Murrell: Filumena (2003) * John Estacio and John Murrell: Frobisher (2007) * Allan Gilliland and Val Brandt: Hannaraptor (2008; one-act opera for young audiences) * Bramwell Tovey and John Murrell: The Inventor (2011) * Arthur Bachmann and Clem Martini: What Brought Us Here (2012) Calgary Opera was a co-commissioner of Jake Heggie and Gene Scheer's 2012 opera Moby-Dick, along with the Dallas Opera, the San Francisco Opera, the San Diego Opera, and the State Opera of South Australia.

Leonard. It stars Stephen Adly Guirgis and Michael Pitt and is set in an unnamed prison in California. The film received numerous independent film nominations and was awarded the Lake Placid Film Festival Grand Jury Prize. Plot Randy (Pitt), a 20-year-old convict, is taken to his cell by a Correctional Officer (David Zayas). He is greeted by his new cellmate, Jake (Guirgis), a veteran prisoner serving a life sentence. Randy explains that he is serving 25 years for spray painting his neighbor's Mercedes-Benz. The next morning, Jake begins telling Randy a story about the worst sexual encounter he ever had. The story terrifies Randy, who begins to realize that Jake's motive may be more than just friendship. The conversation turns toward how Jake feels homosexuality is a state of mind. The breakfast bell rings and the story is interrupted, much to Randy's relief. Jake seems to drop the topic and return to his more friendly demeanor. However, Randy is quickly brought back to the horrible reality of his situation when Jake forces him to wear his shirt in a feminine style and to hold his hand as they go to lunch (See prison sexuality). Several months later, Randy's mother (Laila Robins) visits him at the prison. Randy lies to her and says his cell mate and he are getting along well. The brief visit only highlights Randy's isolation, as his mother is powerless to do anything to help him. Moments later, Jake again prods the now bruised and bloody Randy to tell him about his \\"worst fuck.\\" Randy tells Jake about his first sexual experience: he was 17 and drunk in a Tijuana strip club, and paid a stripper $35 for oral sex in a room above the dance floor. Afterwards, he saw the same stripper perform a striptease in which she revealed that she was a pre-operational transsexual. Randy then tells Jake that he \\"thought that was the worst it was ever going to get,\\" insinuating that his current situation as Jake's sex slave is far worse. Jake appears angry and offended, but then seems guilt ridden. Again, Jake snaps out of his more tender feelings and, replacing them with cruelty, forces Randy to perform oral sex on him. Afterward, Jake makes pleasant conversation as Randy lies in the fetal position in his bunk. That night, as Jake sleeps, Randy creeps silently to his cellmate's bedside, preparing to stab him in the throat with a pencil as the older man sleeps. Randy hesitates and Jake wakes up. Jake doesn't attempt to physically restrain Randy, but instead tells him that he doesn't have the heart to kill a man in cold blood, and that even if he did he wouldn't kill him. Jake tells Randy that he is all that Randy has, that he is his protection, alluding perhaps to an even more brutal sexual slavery among other inmates were he not tied down to Jake. He sincerely tells Randy that he is his only friend. Jake then tells Randy to go back to his bed and think about all the things he will do when he is finally released. Jake then tells the now nearly tearful Randy why his mother stopped writing back; she had died and no one told him. The prison authorities had refused to let him go to his mother's funeral. Jake then tells Randy to make sure that he gets to see his mother's funeral, that it is very important to be able to say goodbye.

Born in Toronto, Ontario, he was vice president and director of creative services at the typographic firm Cooper and Beatty Ltd. when he designed the new CN logo in 1959. In 1962, he became art director for Maclean's magazine. From 1963 to 1968, he was director of creative services at MacLaren Advertising. From 1968 to 1976, he was the chief designer at the University of Toronto Press. He was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and the Alliance Graphique Internationale, a Fellow of the Ontario College of Art, and the first Fellow of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada. Chronology =Early Years= Allan Robb Fleming was the son of Isabella Osborne Fleming, a nurse, and Allan Stevenson Fleming, a clerk with Canadian National Railways. They were both Scottish immigrants to Toronto. Between 1937 and 1939 the young Allan was hospitalized in Sick Children's Hospital in Toronto because of an ear infection that required radical surgery and caused the permanent loss of hearing in his left ear. He never forgot the trauma. In 1939 Allan and his mother travelled to California as part of his recuperation; attending the Hollywood Premier of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" formed an indelible impression. Back in Toronto, he attended Western Technical Collegiate from 1943 to 1945 in the commercial art stream. When he was 15, in 1944, his father died of bone cancer. From 1945 until 1947 Fleming worked as an illustrator in the mail order-advertising department of the T. Eaton Company, and then until 1951 became a layout artist with Art Associates Studio and an art director with the advertising firm Aikin McCracken. Fleming married Nancy Barbara Chisholm in 1951. Working at the advertising firm Art and Design Service, he was involved with clients such as Ford, Helena Rubenstein, and Kaiser-Frazer. In April 1953, the Flemings relocated to England for two years, where Fleming studied letterforms and the design of type and books, being mentored by such eminent English designers and design historians as Stanley Morison, Oliver Simon, Herbert Spencer, and Beatrice Warde. =Getting Established= Fleming in 1959 When the Flemings returned to Toronto in May 1955, Allan set up as a freelance designer with illustrator Lewis Parker and taught part-time at the Ontario College of Art. He became head of typography at the college, a post he held until 1961. He also set up an independent graphic design studio in his home in November 1955, hiring his then student, Ken Rodmell, as his assistant a year later. It was in this period that Fleming designed his first book. In September 1957 Fleming joined Cooper & Beatty Typesetters as typographic director and designer. The range and flair of the work he effected for C&B; garnered attention internationally, and brought in a host of awards from the New York Art Directors Club, the Type Directors Club of New York, and the AIGA among others. As well as paying work for companies such as General Motors, London Life, the Hudson's Bay Company, and others, Fleming produced witty and effective advertising ephemera for C&B; itself. He also designed the \\"Type-o- file,\\" an innovative pick-and-mix box of type specimens arranged by family. Fleming also co-organized (with Franklyn Smith) a number of significant exhibitions of internationally acclaimed designers such as Karl Gerstner, Hermann Zapf and Saul Bass at C&B;'s headquarters in Toronto. In 1958 he attended the highly influential Silvermine Conference (\\"The Art and Science of Typography: An International Seminar of Typographic Design\\") in Norwalk, Connecticut, delivering that year the Rous Lecture on Typography at the Ontario College of Art, on the subject of legibility. The Flemings' first daughter, Martha, was born in October 1958. =CN Logo= Allan Fleming at the launch of the CN logo, 1960 In 1959 the New York industrial design firm James Valkus commissioned Fleming to create a new logo for Canadian National Railways as a key part of Valkus' company-wide corporate redesign programme. The resulting logo, launched in 1960, is still in use today and acclaimed as one of the top 50 corporate logos of all time by design historian Alice Rawsthorn [Report on Business, October 2000]. In this same year he designed an innovative and gritty fundraising brochure in an unusual photo-documentary style for the United Church of Canada, as well as \\"Printing and Social Change\\" by Marshall McLuhan, which was published in Printing Progress: A Mid-Century Report by the International Association of Printing House Craftsmen. Fleming also established his first private press that year, the Tortoise Press, whose first book was Eight Poems, by Richard Outram. Besides launching the CN symbol in 1960, Fleming redesigned the Bank of Nova Scotia logo, and worked on projects for Dow Chemical Company, Salada Foods, Jordan Wines, Vickers and Benson, Eaton's, and of course Cooper & Beatty. He began designing more books, such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts' Paul-Emile Borduas and the National Gallery of Canada's Canadian Painters in Watercolour and Folk Painters of the Canadian West. Peter Fleming, Nancy and Allan's only son, was born in August. From late June to early September 1960 Fleming travelled to the UK and Europe on a Canada Council for the Arts grant, meeting among others Jan Tschichold, Karl Gerstner, and Gunter Gerhard Lange of the Berthold type-foundry. He exhibited work at Monotype House Gallery in London at the invitation of Beatrice Warde, gave an address on North American graphic design, and persuaded Ken Rodmell, then living in London, to return to Toronto to work for him at Cooper & Beatty and join Jim Donoahue who by then also worked in the creative department at C&B.; In 1961, Fleming became vice-president and typographic director in charge of creative services at C&B.; =Maclean's Magazine, MacLaren Advertising, Ontario Hydro= Maclean's Magazine cover by Fleming, 3 November 1962 1962 was another busy year for Fleming. He designed a logo for the Montreal Trust Company; letterhead for Hawker Siddeley Canada; graphics and the logo for Toronto's Malton Airport (architect John B. Parkin); all signage, monumental lettering, and the foundation stone for Massey College at the University of Toronto (architect Ron Thom); annual reports and invitations; and much more. But in November 1962, he left C&B; in order to become art director at Maclean's magazine. After a tumultuous nine months there, during which Fleming radically redesigned the look of the magazine, he was hired as executive art director at MacLaren Advertising Company Ltd. Its clients included General Electric, General Motors, Hockey Night in Canada, Imperial Oil, and Lever Brothers. That same year Fleming was commissioned to design a new logo for Ontario Hydro (launched 1965), as well as the crest, letterhead, and other related materials for the new Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario (architect Ron Thom). In April 1963, Allan and Nancy's third child, Susannah, was born. Fleming was promoted in 1965 to vice- president and associate general manager, creative department at MacLaren Advertising. Fleming was involved that year in Liberal Party campaign materials ‚Äì an election the Liberals won. Although he has never received any credit for it, it's very likely that he had a hand in guiding the final design execution of the Canadian flag. Although it's attributed to others, it bears many of his typical design stylings and hallmarks and that he was hired by the federal government is indicated in his archives, according to his daughter. It has stood as one of the best national flag designs ever done. In 1966 Fleming became a MacLaren's director; by then he was responsible for the work of sixty-three staff in creative services. Among other accomplishments that year, seven of Fleming's projects were chosen for exhibition in Typomundus 20, the first international juried exhibition of typographic design, which was held in Toronto. Canada: A Year of the Land, 1967 Lorraine Monk of the National Film Board, Still Photography Division, commissioned Fleming to design the sumptuous NFB Centennial book, Canada: A Year of the Land/Canada, du temps qui passe, for which he was awarded the Centennial Medal of Canada and a gold medal for book design at Graphica '67'. =UTP Years= In 1968 the first hint of heart trouble occurred. Fleming was unwell that spring, and left MacLaren Advertising in May, though he continued to be on the board of directors and served as a creative consultant. That month he shifted gears to become chief of design at the University of Toronto Press, a post that was created for him, and an association he maintained until his death in 1977. UTP was then the fourth largest university press in North America, publishing an average of eighty to a hundred books a year. While revolutionizing the look of scholarly books at UTP, Fleming also continued to do a wide variety of other design jobs for the Canada Council, Galanty Productions, Gramercy Holding Ltd, Jordan Wines, Philip and Noah Torno, the Hudson's Bay Company, and other MacLaren Advertising clients. With master printer Ernie Herzig, he set up another small press, Martlet Press, which produced among others high-quality photography books with the National Film Board. A UTP Christmas keepsake, The Alphabet Book, by Kettle Point School and Anne and Alex Wyse, won an AIGA '50 Books of the Year'. The Martlet Press's own John Fillion: Thoughts About My Sculpture also won an AIGA award. =The Last Decade= In 1969 Fleming designed both a symbol and the launch publications for the new Ontario Science Centre, a symbol for the Metropolitan Separate School Board (now today as the Toronto Catholic District School Board), the NE Thing Company logo, and a style guide for Canada Post that set the bar for the next 20 years. As a public educationalist, he was also a driving force behind such exhibitions as Art at the Service of Intention: Graphic Designers at Work (Art Gallery of Ontario), and appeared on Robert Fulford's TV program, 'On Books'. Two of UTP's publications designed by Fleming -- The Economic Atlas of Ontario and Rural Ontario‚Äîwon AIGA awards in 1969. The following year, Fleming designed a logo for the Metropolitan Educational Television Authority and one for Gray Coach Lines, and was appointed to the National Design Council. Fleming also found time for civic duty, designing posters for the \\"Stop the Spadina Expressway\\" movement spearheaded by Jane Jacobs, Marshall McLuhan and William Kilbourn. Also in 1971, another UTP book, Goethe's Faust, translated by the renowned literary scholar and painter Barker Fairley and illustrated by one of Fleming's prot√©g√©s, Randy Jones, won yet another AIGA award, and The Economic Atlas of Ontario won the World's Most Beautiful Book prize at the Leipzig International Exhibition of Book Arts. 1971 saw Fleming designing the United Church of Canada's new Hymnal, in tandem with designer and UTP colleague Laurie Lewis. A notable UTP book that year was Sculpture Inuit, done for the Canadian Eskimo Arts Council. Closer to home, Fleming's Martlet Press published Twenty-Eight Drawings by Barbara Howard: Howard was a close family friend, the wife of poet Richard Outram. And, in exchange for books for his considerable collection, Fleming also began designing stationery and catalogues for Monk Bretton Books, an antiquarian book dealer specializing in fine press books. In June 1971 Fleming had a heart attack while in Halifax and then a few months later a paralyzing stroke, forcing him to go on disability leave from UTP. He didn't stop working, designing philatelic materials for Canada Post such as a stamp with the artist Alma Duncan, first-day covers for the Paul Kane and British Columbia centennial stamps, and writing and hosting a program for CBC TV entitled \\"Calligraphy: My Love Affair with the Alphabet.\\" Quill & Quire, the monthly Canadian book trade magazine, ran a feature on AF, and he continued to make regular contributions to professional gatherings. By 1972 Fleming had returned to UTP, but not for long: he suffered another debilitating heart attack early in the year. In 1973, Fleming joined Burton Kramer Associates as one of two principals, alongside Kramer. Among other projects during that period, the firm developed the new visual identity for the CBC and for Reed Paper. Concurrently, he also incorporated as Allan R. Fleming Graphic Design Consultants, but in August he experienced further heart problems which forced him to cut back on various activities. A highlight of the year was being made a fellow of the Ontario College of Art, the first year this honour had been given, alongside the painter A.Y. Jackson. Another NFB book, \\"Canada\\", won the Leipzig World's Most Beautiful Book prize. As of January 1974 Fleming became a director of the industrial design firm Kuypers Adamson Norton Ltd. and launched the CBC symbol with Burton Kramer. St Thomas's Anglican Church in Toronto commissioned him to design a logo for its centennial, and continued to design philatelic materials for Canada Post. His work with UTP that year included the template for The Collected Works of Erasmus, which is still used by UTP for this monumental editorial project, and another AIGA award-winner, Clarence Tracy's The Rape Observ'd. He resigned from Burton Kramer Associates Ltd in March 1976, joining Burns Cooper Donaohue and Fleming the following month. The range of his work from that office covered his complete editorial redesign for Canada's newspaper The Financial Post, a logo for media company Torstar, packaging design for MacKenzie Seeds and an award-winning album cover for singer-songwriter Sylvia Tyson. It was a tumultuous year: in March he also left his wife and family and set up house with an editor from UTP, Prudence Tracy. A solo exhibition of Fleming's work curated by Alvin Balkind opened at the Vancouver Art Gallery; the exhibition also travelled to the Alberta College of Art in Calgary, and coming back to Toronto from the opening there, Fleming suffered a stroke. In late December Fleming had a cardiopulmonary collapse, from which he died on 31 December. Fleming's Influence This outlined trajectory of Allan Fleming's career gives a sense of his personality and energy if only by demonstrating the sheer quantity and variety of his undertakings, but a simple chronology can't adequately suggest what Brian Donnelly in issue 63 of The Devil's Artisan calls \\"his persuasive presentation style and genuine brilliance with words.\\" Nor can it convey the attentive and inclusive style that made Fleming such an inspiring colleague and friend: one from whom all who were interested could learn. He was an indefatigable mentor, teacher and public champion of design in all aspects of Canadian cultural life. He revolutionized more than the design department at UTP; he also revolutionized the relationship between editors, designers, and production and marketing employees, inspiring all with his camaraderie and brilliant innovation. This ability to inspire and galvanise disparate professionals was also a hallmark of his work in advertising and in typographic design, when those professions were not the flat hierarchies they have since become. His early death was a great loss to family and friends, but his work as a designer, collaborator and teacher continues to reverberate through the Canadian design world and beyond.

He worked giving piano lessons and accompanying dancers, singers, and silent movies. Nazi anti-Jewish labour laws rendered Tal unemployed and he turned to studying photography with Schule Reimann with the intention of acquiring a profession that would make him eligible for an \\"immigration certificate\\" to Mandate Palestine.Fleisher, Robert: Twenty Israeli composers: voices of culture. Wayne State University Press (1997) , pp.67-78 In 1934, the family immigrated to Palestine with their young son Re'uven.Later a member of kibbutz Megiddo, killed in action in the Six-Day War. Tal worked as a photographer in Haifa and Hadera for a short time. The family moved then to Kibbutz Beit Alpha and later to Kibbutz Gesher, where Tal intended to dedicate his time to his music. Finding it hard to adjust to the new social reality in the kibbutz, the family settled in Jerusalem where Tal established professional and social connections. He performed as a pianist, gave piano lessons and occasionally played harp with the newly founded Palestine Orchestra. In 1937, the couple divorced. Tal accepted an invitation from Emil Hauser to teach piano, theory, and composition at the Palestine Conservatory, and in 1948 he was appointed director of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance in Jerusalem, a post he held until 1952.

Almost all of Tal's works are published by the Israel Music Institute (IMI).  Musical style  The characteristic features of Tal's music are broad dramatic gestures and driving bursts of energy generated, by various types of ostinato or sustained textural accumulations. Complex rhythmic patterning is typical of the widely performed Second Symphony and of a number of notable dance scores. But Tal's marked dramatic and philosophical propensities find total expression only in opera, particularly in the large-scale, 12-note opera Ashmedai...Ringer, Alexander L.: Tal, Josef. in: The New Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, (1980) p. 537 Tal's early compositional style was a point of some controversy, due to his departure from ‚Äì and criticism of ‚Äì the so- called 'Mediterranean school' favoured by many Israeli composers at the time. This was an approach pioneered by Paul Ben-Haim and other composers, who set traditional Middle Eastern Jewish melodies within a European, often Impressionist, harmonic vocabulary.Between Two Cultures: A Conversation with Shulamit Ran Author(s): Malcolm Miller and Shulamit Ran, Tempo, Vol. 58, No. 227 (Jan., 2004), pp. 15-32 He was the most distinctive among the first generation of composers who principally opposed the use of folklorism and orientalism.Seter, Ronit in On the one hand, like other members of the pioneer generation of composers who emigrated to Palestine in the 1930s, Tal sought to create a new national style distinct from European (and particularly German) modernism. On the other hand, to distance himself from Ben-Haim's \\"Mediterranean\\" school he adopted a distinctly modernist style.Malcolm Miller, \\"Between Two Cultures: A Conversation with Shulamit Ran\\", Tempo 58, no. 227 (January 2004): 15‚Äì32; here 15 and 29. Tal's music is not monolithic. Despite its dominant atonality, Tal's music has undergone changes and modifications over the years. These changes reflect what occurred over time in Israeli music. Most of the works which Tal wrote around 1950 are characterized by traditional components and frameworks, written in traditional techniques such as variations, and atonal musical language. In the late 'forties and early 'fifties, when the Mediterranean style was at its peak, Tal was a frequent borrower of Oriental-Jewish source material as the basis for his compositions. If we take Ben-Zion Orgad's definition as the most pertinent it would surely follow that Tal's Piano Sonata,The Sonata for Piano is included in the repertoire of The 13th Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Master Competition (2011) 1st symphony, 2nd Piano Concerto and other works based on Oriental-Jewish melodies are definitely not Mediterranean.Ron, Yohanan, Expressions of the Twelve-tone Row in the Works of Oedeon Partos and Josef Tal (Orbis Musicae Vol. XI, 1993/4, pp. 81-91)Ron, Yohanan, Josef Tal: \\"The Death of Moses\\" Requiem for Solo, Choir, Orchestra and Magnetic Tape ‚Äì the text and the music (HaArchion le-musica Israelit no. 7, 1995, pp. 14-21)Ron, Yohanan, The Tone as an Idea and a Subject in the Later Works of Josef Tal (Israel Studies in musicology, Vol. VI, 1996, pp. 71-80)Ron, Yohanan, The \\"Where and When\\" in the Compositions of Josef Tal (HaArchion le-musica Israelit No. 9, 1997, pp. 7-16)The Cyclic Concept and the Place of the Tone C in the Works of Josef Tal In: Ron, Yohanan, The Music of Josef Tal ‚Äì Selected Writings, The Israeli Music Archive, Tel-Aviv University, 2000 Reflections (1950) is neither tonal nor serial, and inhabits a world not unlike Bartok of the third and fourth string quartets, tempered somewhat by a decidedly Stravinskian acidity, along with a Hindemithian contrapuntal propensity. This, however, should not be taken literally. Cast in three movements, and having a performance time of approximately fifteen minutes, its procedures relate it more to the general neo-classic aesthetic of the late 1930s and 1940s. The use of solo strings played off against the ripieni of the string body points to the Baroque concerto grosso. As if to trump its neo-classical models, the final movement is a \\"fugue\\" in which Tal obliquely pays his respects to Hindemith without reverting explicitly to Hindemith's vocabulary.Leichtling, Avrohom: Josef Tal, Reflections. in: Musikproduktion H√∂flich Repertuar and Opera Explorer (2005) Tal's numerous works for traditional media defy classification as part of any \\"school\\". No doubt Schoenberg had an early influence on the Berlin composition student. But neither his widely played First Symphony (1952) nor his exceedingly well-wrought String Quartet in one movement, nor, for that matter, his subsequent Cello Concerto is in any structural sense dodecaphonically conceived. While row materials are freely used, the method of composing with twelve tones is nowhere strictly applied, not even in as recent and completely atonal a piece as the Structure for solo harp. Similarly, oriental materials are employed sparingly and with the greatest caution. Whereas the Symphony is actually based on a Persian-Jewish lament as notated by A. Z. Idelsohn, the Quartet no longer goes beyond the use of a few characteristic motifs. And if the Symphony still features a dance section in accordance with the then prevailing tenets of the Mediterranean School, such sacrifices to popular taste, however subtle, have been conspicuously missing in recent years.Ringer, Alexander L.: Musical Composition in Modern Israel. The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 51, No. 1, Oxford University Press (Jan., 1965), pp. 282-297 A comprehensive examination of Tal's work suggests the following analysis:Ron, Yohanan: The Instrumental Music of Josef Tal: Style and Artistic Concepts ‚Äì Ph.D. Thesis, Bar-Ilan University (1990) (A) First period (works written up to 1959): These have a three-part structure; the micro-structural idea is based on the relationship between notes; the beat and the melodic line occupy an important place among the musical components. (B) Second period (1959‚Äì1967): Characterized by the use of dodecaphonic technique. (C) Third period (from 1967 on): Characterized by all (instrumental) works being written in one condensed movement. The single note, with its potential implications, is the micro-structural idea. Time, the sound in its various aspects, the rhythmic figure, the color and the texture are the dominant components... The influence of electronic music is in evidence. Transition from one period to the next is gradual, the language in all of them being atonal and the compositions developing from one basic idea. (D) All Tal's works contain a recapitulation, which he terms \\"closing the cycle\\"... Tal sees his compositions as a metaphor for geometric circle, a perfect form, the life cycle. Life begins with the note C (doh) ‚Äì a \\"center of gravity\\"... Tal employs innovative instrumental and orchestral techniques while retaining a predisposition for tradition, especially the Baroque... He divides the orchestra into sound and color group, sometimes also attaching a special texture to each group. This technique is personal and could be called \\"a special language\\". The whole orchestra is used sparingly, only at strategic points... = Composer‚Äìlistener relationship = First lines of Piano Concerto No. 2 (1953) Tal did not underestimate the importance of relationship between composer and listener, and was aware of the difficulties posed by \\"modern music\\":  Electronic music  A caricature by Meir Ronnen following the premiere of Tal's Concerto No. 4 for Piano & Electronics.Bar-Am, Benjamin: Unconventional Music, Jerusalem Post Musical Diary, 29 Aug, 1962. Tal at the Electronic Music Studio (~1965) The founding figure of the field in Israel, Josef Tal, was first exposed to electronic music in the late 1920s in Germany. The founding of the Israel Center for Electronic Music was the result of a six-month UNESCO research fellowship on which Tal toured major international electronic music studios, in 1958. It was a meeting with Milton Babbitt at The Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center that pointed Josef Tal to the technology he needed to found the first electronic music studio in Israel.Gluck, Robert J.: Educating International Composers: The Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, in EMS Proceedings and Other Publications, http://www.ems-network.org/spip.php?article267 He learned from Vladimir Ussachevsky, about a new invention by Canadian inventor Hugh Le Caine, called the Multi-track. First built in 1955, this device could replay six independent magnetic tapes, with the speed and direction of each tape separately controllable. Le Caine's idea was to design an instrument to facilitate composition in the Parisian musique concr√®te tradition of Pierre Schaeffer. Following a successful fund-raising by Shalheveth Freier the Multi- track which was built for Tal's studio was completed and delivered to Jerusalem in 1961. It required a trip by Le Caine to set it up correctly.Tal, Josef,: An Encounter with Hugh Le caine, Musicworks (83) 2002, pp 50-51 Tal produced some of the earlier examples of electrico-acoustical music, and in this is joined by such as Edgard Var√®se, Mario Davidovsky, and Luciano Berio. As might be expected from a man of his candor, Tal is completely undoctrinaire about electronic music and broaches its problems with the same healthy skepticism that has marked his approach to the twelve-tone method or the issue of a \\"national\\" Israeli style. Thus, he declared: Imbued with the kind of realism found only in the true idealist, Tal is indeed a liberal in a realm of artistic endeavor where extremism often goes on a rampage. Combining a good deal of modesty with a strong sense of personal value, he impresses even those who find his music rather forbidding and exerts a far more powerful influence on the younger generation than some of his more \\"successful\\" colleagues who intoxicate a gullible public with their facile \\"Mediterranean\\" orientalism. Tal was a strong believer in the value of electronic instruments and their potential to transcend the limitations of acoustical means of sound production.Gluck, Bob: Electronic Music in Israel, http://cec.concordia.ca/econtact/11_4/israel_gluck.html (The original version of this article was published by The EMF Institute, Electronic Music Foundation, Ltd., in 2006) Tal regarded electronic music as a new music language, which he describes as unstable and lacking a crystallized definition. He viewed the computer as an instrument which compels the composer to disciplined thinking. In return, it stores the data it was fed with absolute faithfulness. Nevertheless, when the computer is ill-used, the composer's incompetence will be revealed, as he is unable to unite computer with the realm of music. But according to Tal, composing electronic music has another aspect too: when the composer chooses the computer's music-notation as his tool for creating, he concomitantly annuls the performer's role as an interpreter. From that point on, it is only the composer's mental capacity that counts, and the performance is independent of the interpreter's virtuosity. Tal integrated electronic music in many of his works for \\"conventional\\" instruments, and was actually one of the world's pioneers in doing so. His pieces for electronic music and harp, piano or harpsichord, and operas like Massada or Ashmedai are typical examples. Following Concerto No.4 for Piano & Electronics premiere (27/8/1962), Herzl Rosenblum the daily Yediot Ahronot's editor and critic, used the terms \\"Terror!\\", \\"Cacophony\\" and \\"Minority dictatorship\\"... Tal taught electronic music and composed, for nearly two decades. Upon his retirement in 1980, Menachem Zur became director and remained in this role until the University closed the studio, for a variety of reasons, in the 1990s.

Obradoviƒá, delighted, he happily and sincerely greeted the Serb uprising with this special, patriotic poem. Obradoviƒá extensively used the concept of \\"Mother Serbia\\" in his works, including this poem. Of his poems, Vostani Serbije is the most patriotic. In it, he calls on a new Serbia, with overtones of memory on the Serbian Empire which had been long gone. Obradoviƒá became the first Minister of Education of Revolutionary Serbia. Bo≈æe pravde was the anthem of the Principality of Serbia and the Kingdom of Serbia until 1918 when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was formed. In 1992, Vostani Serbije and March on the Drina were proposed as the anthem of Serbia along with B–æ≈æe pravde. The latter, promulgated by then-ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, even received a plurality of popular vote on referendum, but it never got officially adopted, until 2004. Ahead of the 2000 parliamentary election in Serbia, an altered version of the song was used in campaigns (...you have slept enough, and joked enough, now wake up, and awaken the Serbs, to vote!). It is one of the best known patriotic songs in the country, and for some time it was considered as a potential national anthem following the replacement of the old Yugoslav anthem Hej Sloveni following the break-up of Yugoslavia. The song was set to music written by Vartkes Baronijan, Z. Vauda and Ljuba Manasijeviƒá.Iz licnog ugla  Lyrics  { width=\\"100%\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  ;Serbian Latin: Vostani Serbije! Vostani carice!

It is (or was) endemic to the island of Pohnpei (Federated States of Micronesia) in the Pacific Ocean. It was called \\"sie\\" (pronounced see-ah) by the Pohnpei islanders. It was named after the Austrian ornithologist August von Pelzeln (1825‚Äì1891). Description The Pohnpei starling reached a size of 19 cm. It was generally dark with sooty brown upperparts. The head was darker and exhibit a black forehead and black lores. The wings, rump, uppertail coverts and tail were paler and showed a stronger brown coloring at the head. The underparts were washed olive brown. The bill and the feet were black. The iris was brown. The juveniles were similar to the adults except the upperparts of their plumage exhibited a paler brown. Its call consists of a bell-like shrill \\"see-ay\\". Habitat The Pohnpei starling was native to dark, damp mountain forests in altitudes above 425 m, but it was also observed at lower altitudes. The last specimen was shot in 1994 at an altitude of 750 m above the sea level. Ecology and diet It was a non-migratory bird and it was defended its territory by pairs. It foraged diurnally and its diet consisted of flowers, berries and seeds of evergreen bushes and trees as well as insects and maggots. Reports that it has built its nest in tree holes are unconfirmed. Threats and extinction The Pohnpei starling was discovered by the Polish ethnographer John Stanislaw Kubary (1846‚Äì1896) and first described by German ornithologist Otto Finsch in 1876. The holotype which was deposited at the Godeffroy Museum in Hamburg, Germany for a while is now at the Museum Naturalis in Leiden, Netherlands. It seems that this bird was rather common at the beginning of the 1930s. Sixty specimens were obtained during the Whitney South Seas Expedition led by William Coultas in 1930 and 1931. One specimen was shot by Lawrence P. Richards in 1948 who sent the skin to the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawaii. In 1956, ornithologist Joe T. Marshall was the last western scientist who saw this bird alive. Marshall shot two specimens and sent the skins to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Afterwards this bird was lost. In 1973 or 1974 it was apparently sighted at the Nantolemal Point but this unconfirmed. After several unconfirmed reports by Pohnpei islanders there were surveys in 1976, 1977, and 1983 which unfortunately failed. In 1990 it was classified as extinct by the IUCN, but on 4 July 1995 ornithologist Donald W. Buden obtained a dead female that was shot by a native guide at a herpetological expedition during 1994. Therefore, the IUCN has reclassified it as critically endangered in 2000. In 2008, surveys produced 3 records, although these have not been fully documented. A seven-day expedition in 2010 failed to produce any sightings.Pohnpei Starling Aplonis pelzelni. BirdLife International The reasons for its vanishing remained unknown. Competition with other bird species and the bird hunting have played certainly an important role and as with many bird species on islands the clutches were plundered by rats. Habitat loss might have played a minor role because even if 37% of the highland forests were cleared between 1975 and 1995, a large part of its habitat still remains.

At the height of the struggle, the seamen bombarded Liverpool Town Hall. At the time a large number of the working class in Liverpool were seamen and enjoyed the support of much of the general population. In August 1775, the American War of Independence had a big impact on the economy of Liverpool: 3,000 unemployed seamen were to be found in Liverpool. Merchants decided to reduce the standard pay for rigging out a ship in preparation for a voyage, which was 30 shillings a month. Seamen who had been engaged to rig the Derby found that they were to be paid at only 20 shillings a month, and were told that there were plenty of sailors to be had in the port. The seamen returned to the ship, cut down the rigging and left it lying on deck. The rest of the rigged ships in the harbour were treated in the same way. When nine of the men were arrested and committed to prison by the magistrates, two or three thousand seamen surrounded the prison and secured the release of eight of the men. They marched away, discovered that they had left one prisoner behind, and marched back to the prison. Here they succeeded in releasing not only the other seaman, but also a woman who had been accused of aiding and abetting the rioters. The crowd marched to the Town Hall - which was also the merchants' Exchange - with a red flag. They continued their peaceful meetings and marching and a delegation met Lord Mayor James Clemens on the fifth day. There was a report that the merchants agreed to pay the rates that were asked. However, that afternoon the merchants hired a body of armed men at ten shillings a day, and posted some in the Town Hall to arrest the strike leaders. In the evening, they fired on the unarmed strikers who were surrounding the building. The dead were variously reported at two or seven, the wounded at ten or several. The seamen went aboard ships collecting cannon, and then put them into position to bombard the Town Hall. They bedecked their hats with red ribbons, raised the red flag, and at 1pm the next day, they began bombarding the Town Hall. Four people were killed. The merchants sent a message to the military in Manchester and two days later 100 cavalry with six officers set off for Liverpool. The seamen were attending the funeral of the victims of the shooting. The troops hunted down and arrested forty to sixty sailors and marched them off to Lancaster for indictment and trial. Only twelve of the sailors were indicted at Lancaster. Eight were found guilty, but all were discharged on agreeing to enlist in the Navy. References Hunter, B.

James Ida also known as \\"Little Guy\\" (born 1940) is a New York mobster and former consigliere of the Genovese crime family. James was born to first generation immigrants from Lombardy. Growing up in the Little Italy neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, Ida was inducted into the Genovese crime family in the late 1970s. Ida was placed in the Little Italy-based crew of captain Matthew \\"Matty the Horse\\" Ianniello, frequently serving as Ianniello's bodyguard and chauffeur. Ida's younger brother Joseph also served in Ianniello's crew. Racketeering in Little Italy In 1988, after Ianniello was convicted on federal racketeering charges, Ida took over the Ianniello crew. In 1991, after consigliere Louis Manna was convicted of federal racketeering charges, Ida became the official consigliere of the Genovese family. When boss Vincent Gigante and underboss Venero Mangano went to prison, Ida handled the day-to-day functions of the Genovese family with acting boss Liborio Bellomo. Ida also oversaw rackets involving the Mason Tenders Union and the San Gennaro Feast in Little Italy. Each vendor working at the Feast had to pay tribute to the Genovese family.\\"19 indicted in blow to Genovese mob\\" New York Times June 12, 1996 Ida helped oversee the collection of rents from some 400 vendors. While the mob typically demanded $4,000 a booth, the society running the festival would report to city officials that booth vendors had paid only $1,000 or so each. The city would then assess each vendor a 25 percent permit fee based on this rent. The end result was that the city and charities received very little money.\\" Genovese family counselor is convicted of racketeering\\" New York Times April 24, 1997 Ida also owned a social club in Little Italy that he used for family business. However, in 1990, capo James Messera was sent to prison based partly on conversations recorded by law enforcement at the club. Ida soon switched to conducting business on walks through the neighborhood and meetings in diners and parks. To counter Ida's new strategy, Federal investigators in 1994 obtained warrants for use of roving bugs and were able to intercept six of Ida's conversations with family members and union associates. Protection for La Toya Jackson In 1994, Ida was involved in the extortion of money from singer La Toya Jackson. According to the FBI, Jackson's husband Gordon was paying the Genovese family $1,000 per month for the use of Genovese soldier John Schenone as a \\"bodyguard\\" whenever the singer visited New York. Schenone would then present the checks to Ida. On one occasion, the FBI recorded Ida angrily complaining to Schenone about receiving a bad check from the Jacksons.\\"THE GENOVESE FAMILY\\" TruTV Crime Library Prison In June 1996, Ida and 19 other Genovese members and associates were charged with violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The government offered Ida a 15-year plea deal in exchange for cooperation, but Ida refused it. However, fellow mobster Bellomo accepted a plea agreement, reportedly enraging Ida. The FBI was sufficiently concerned about the threat to notify Bellomo's lawyer and to place Bellomo and Ida in solitary confinement. Ida's time incarcerated for the durations of his trial was spent in solitary. He connected with Pavle Stanimirovic, also known as Paul Montana and 'Punch', the son of Vojislav Stanimiroviƒá.

Description and history  Inscription upon a chess piece unearthed at Timerevo. The site covers an area of five hectares and has no fortifications. It seems to have been operated by the Varangians from their principal base at Sarskoe Gorodishche, near Rostov. Like Sarskoe, it is situated at a distance from a major waterway ‚Äî the Volga River. Nevertheless, substantial amounts of Arabic coins indicate its position as the most important Scandinavian trade outpost in the proximity of the Volga trade route. The site was first settled by a mixture of Norse merchants and local population in the ninth century. This dating is based on three major hoards of dirhams that were detected at Timeryovo since the 1960s. The first hoard, numbering about 2,100 coins, was dispersed before scholars learnt about its existence. Only seventeen coins are known from this deposit, the earliest datable to 867. Another hoard also numbering more than 2,000 dirhams (entire and in pieces), was the largest deposit of such coins ever found from Early Medieval Europe. The earliest coin was issued by Idris II (who reigned in the 810s and 820s). Many dirhams have Runic graffiti carved on them. The site was abandoned towards the end of the ninth century, only to be revived half a century later. At least 400 druzhina kurgans were erected there in that period. The burial rite normally featured cremation. Excavations revealed an unusual amount of Scandinavian pottery and a surprising number of crosses, indicating that a large portion of the Norse population was Christianised. Among other finds were amber artifacts from the Baltic, a unique roaster, a spatha labelled by a certain Ulfberht from the Rhine, and a chess piece with an enigmatic Runic inscription (illustrated, to the right). The site was definitively abandoned in the early eleventh century, simultaneously with the decline of Sarskoe Gorodishche and the foundation of Yaroslavl. The latest coin found at Timerevo was issued by Bruno II of Friesland (dating it between 1038 and 1057).  Similar sites  A growing number of other early medieval sites have been excavated near Yaroslavl, each important in its own way. The site of Mikhailovskoe immediately north of the city was explored from the nineteenth century to 1961. Of 400 barrows excavated there, only four percent yielded Scandinavian finds. Most burials featured inhumations of ordinary Slavs and Merians. The site of Medvezhy Ugol (literally, \\"Bear's Nook\\") in downtown Yaroslavl, proved to be a humble, primarily Merian settlement. More recently, twenty six burial mounds were found at Petrovskoe to the south of the city; these are still largely unexcavated. All these sites date to the mid-tenth century. Although \\"objects of Scandinavian origin constitute a miserly per cent of the total of all finds, and nothing firmly indicating a complete Norman complex has yet been found\\",https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005042/http://www.bbznet.com/scripts/view.php?user=rus_tu&board;=6&id;=1093‚Ñ¥=numtopic&mobileE;=Y scholars suggest that within fundamentally Slavic settlement of the area \\"was a Norman colony, which constituted a staging point midway on the route from the Vikings to the East.\\" Archaeologist Igor Dubov, who excavated the settlement in the 1970s, views it as a center (perhaps the capital) of mysterious Arsania mentioned by Ibn Hawqal.–ò. –í. –î—É–±–æ–≤. \\"–ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞, –≤–µ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º —Å–∏—è—é—â–∏–µ\\". –ò–∑–¥-–≤–æ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–∞, 1985. –°—Ç—Ä. 53.

The victims included more than 80 writers, translators, poets, political activists, and ordinary citizens, :\\"103 is the estimated number of the victims in the 'serial murders'.

The pattern of murders did not come to light until late 1998 when Dariush Forouhar, his wife Parvaneh Eskandari Forouhar, and three dissident writers were murdered over a span of two months. After the murders were publicized, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei denied the government was responsible, and blamed \\"Iran's enemies\\".ŸÖŸÇÿßŸÖ ŸÖÿπÿ∏ŸÖ ÿ±Ÿáÿ®ÿ±€å ÿØÿ± ŸÜŸÖÿßÿ≤ ÿ¨ŸÖÿπŸá ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜ In mid-1999, after great public outcry and journalistic investigation in Iran and publicity abroad, Iranian prosecutors announced they had found the perpetrator.

The murders are said to be \\"still shrouded in secrecy\\", and an indication that the authorities may not have uncovered all perpetrators of the chain murders was the attempted assassination of Saeed Hajjarian, a newspaper editor who is thought to have played a \\"key role\\" in uncovering the killings. On 12 March 2000, Hajjarian was shot in the head and left paralyzed for life. History of chain murders =Killings= The term \\"Chain Murders\\" was first used to describe the murder of six people in late 1998. The first two killed were 70-year-old Dariush Forouhar (secretary general of the opposition party, the Nation of Iran Party), and his wife Parvaneh Eskandari, whose mutilated bodies were found in their south Tehran home on 22 November 1998. Forouhar received 11 knife wounds and Eskandari 24. Their home, which was later ransacked, was thought to be under 24-hour surveillance by the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran,Iran Terror.com thus casting suspicion on that ministry for at least complicity in the murder. On 2 December 1998, Mohammad Mokhtari, an Iranian writer, left his residence and did not return home. A week later his body was identified at the coroner's office. The next to disappear was Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, an author and \\"one of the most active translators of the country,\\" whose body was discovered four days after leaving his office on 8 December. Pooyandeh and Mokhtari's bodies were both found around Shahriar, a \\"mini-city\\" in the south of Tehran, and both had apparently been strangled. On the day Pooyandeh's body was found, 12 December 1998, fifty writers called on President Khatami to find the persons behind the crimes. In the meantime, other suspicious and unsolved murders of dissidents over the previous decade were put forward by reformers as connected: Ahmad Miralaee, Ebrahim Zalzadeh, Ghafar Hosseini, Manouchehr Saneie and his wife Firoozeh Kalantari, Ahmad Tafazzoli. The body of Majid Sharif, a translator and journalist who contributed to the banned publication Iran-e Farda, was found on the side of a Tehran road on 18 November 1998, three days before the discovery of the bodies of Dariush Forouhar and Parvaneh Eskandari. His official cause of death was \\"heart failure.\\"Alarming pattern of killings and \\"disappearances\\" In the summer of 1996, there had been an unsuccessful attempt to kill a busload of 21 writers en route to a poetry conference in Armenia. At two in the morning, while most of his passengers were sleeping, the driver of the bus attempted to steer the bus off a cliff near the Heyran Pass. \\"When the driver tried to jump out to save himself, a passenger grabbed the wheel and steered the bus back onto the road.\\"Sciolino, Elaine, Persian Mirrors, Touchstone, (2000), p. 239 The driver tried it a second time, \\"diving out of the vehicle just as it careened toward the edge of the 1000-foot free fall.\\" The bus hit a boulder and stopped, saving the lives of 21 writers. The driver ran away.Molavi, Afshin The Soul of Iran, Norton, (2005), p. 1333 The passengers were taken to a nearby Caspian town by authorities, interrogated and warned \\"to discuss the event with no one\\".Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening, by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House New York, 2006, p. 128‚Äì29 The person thought to be the first victim was Kazem Sami Kermani, an \\"Islamic nationalist and physician\\" who had opposed the Shah and served as Minister of Health in the brief post- revolutionary provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. He was later a member of the first Majles where he criticized the government for its continuation of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War after the Liberation of Khorramshahr. He was murdered on 23 November 1988 in his clinic in Tehran by an ax-wielding assailant. =Alleged perpetrators= On 20 December 1998, a statement was issued in Tehran by a group calling itself \\"pure Mohammadan Islam devotees of Mostafa Navvab\\" taking credit for at least some of the killings. The statement attacked reformists and said in part: > \\"Now that domestic politicians, through negligence and leniency, and under > slogan of rule of law, support the masked poisonous vipers of the aliens, > and brand the decisive approaches of the Islamic system, judiciary and > responsible press and advocates of the revolution as monopolistic and > extremist spread of violence and threats to the freedom, the brave and > zealous children of the Iranian Muslim nation took action and by > revolutionary execution of dirty and sold-out elements who were behind > nationalistic movements and other poisonous moves in universities, took the > second practical step in defending the great achievements of the Islamic > Revolution ‚Ä¶ The revolutionary execution of Dariush Forouhar, Parvaneh > Eskandari, Mohammad Mokhtari and Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh is a warning to > all mercenary writers and their counter-value supporters who are cherishing > the idea of spreading corruption and promiscuity in the country and bringing > back foreign domination over Iran...\\" Iran's conservative Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest ranking political and religious authority in Iran, speculated as to the perpetrators. Khamenei blamed foreign powers, stating \\"the enemy was creating insecurity to try to block the progress of Iran's Islamic system.\\" Foreign correspondents believed the main suspects were likely to be conservatives opposed to Iran's more moderate President Mohammad Khatami reform agenda. In Iran, conservative daily newspapers also blamed \\"foreign sources intend on creating an environment of insecurity and instability in the country,\\" for the killings. In particular, they blamed the Iraqi-based Mojahedin-e-Khalq terrorist group. On 4 January 1999, the public relations office of the Ministry of Information \\"unexpectedly\\" issued a short press release claiming \\"staff within\\" its own Ministry \\"committed these criminal activities ‚Ä¶ under the influence of undercover rogue agents\\": > \\"The despicable and abhorring recent murders in Tehran are a sign of chronic > conspiracy and a threat to the national security. The Information Ministry > based on their legal obligations and following clear directives issued by > the Supreme Leader and the President, made the discovery and uprooting of > this sinister and threatening event the priority action for the Ministry. > With the cooperation of the specially appointed Investigatory committee of > the President, the Ministry has succeeded to identify the group responsible > for the killings, has arrested them and processed their cases through the > judicial system. Unfortunately a small number of irresponsible, misguided, > headstrong and obstinate staff within the Ministry of Information who are no > doubt under the influence of undercover rogue agents and act towards the > objectives of foreign and estranged sources committed these criminal > activities\\". Arrested for the dissident murders was Saeed Emami or Islami, the deputy security official of the Ministry of Information, and his colleagues and subordinate staff: Mehrdad Alikhani, Mostafa Kazemi and Khosro Basati. According to Indymedia UK, \\"the agent named as the mastermind behind the assassinations, Saeed Emami, was reported to have killed himself in prison by drinking a bottle of hair remover.\\" > Defendant Ali Rowshani admitted murdering Mokhtari and Pouyandeh. But he > said he had done so under orders from Mostafa Kazemi, a former head of > internal security at the intelligence ministry and another man, Merhdad > Alikhani. Another pair of defendants admitted killing the Forouhars, a > husband and wife found dead at home from multiple stab wounds. They too said > they had received orders from Kazemi and Alikhani. Another man said he had > assisted in the murder. Kazemi was reported telling the court on Saturday he > had been the mastermind behind the killings, while Alikhani said the > decision was taken \\"collectively.\\" The Iranian press reported that Emami was not only responsible for the deaths of Forouhar, Mokhtari, Pooyandeh and Sharif, but also earlier killings in the 1980s and 1990s of Saidi Sirjani, the Mykonos restaurant assassinations, the unsuccessful 1995 attempt to stage a bus accident in the mountains and kill 21 writers, and the unexpected death of Ahmad Khomeini, (Ayatollah Khomeini's son).A Man Called Saeed Emani Human Rights activist Shirin Ebadi claims Emami's \\"friends reported that he belonged to a notorious gang of hard-core religious extremists who believed that the enemies of Islam should be killed.\\"Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening, by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House New York, 2006, p. 138 Saeed Emami's arrest was not revealed, however, until 3 June 1999, six months after his reported suicide. Several facts added to skepticism over whether the true culprits of the murders had been found and justice done, namely: Emami was believed to have had \\"round- the-clock\\" surveillance while in prison, being the prime suspect of a serial political murder case that aroused the whole country; hair-removal cream available in Iran is unlikely to be lethal when ingested; that Emami's confession was not considered evidence and made public by the presiding judge who deemed it \\"unrelated to the case;\\" that > no photos of the agents of the Ministry of Intelligence tried in Dec 2000 ‚Äì > Jan 2001 were published, their identity remained a \\"state secret\\". Most > Iranians are convinced their \\"confessions\\" are part of a deal to allow them > freedom after the trials, irrespective of the verdict. and > There are conflicting reports on the manner of [Emami's] suicide. His body > or its photograph have never been publicly seen and even in the 'Behesht > Zahra' graveyard, where he is said to have been buried, no grave has been > registered in his name. According to Iranterror.com, \\"it was widely assumed that he was murdered in order to prevent the leak of sensitive information about MOIS operations, which would have compromised the entire leadership of the Islamic Republic.\\" There was an antagonism between the authorities and the victims' relatives. The lawyer for the victims relatives, Nasser Zarafshan, was arrested for \\"publicizing the case\\", for which her bail was set at the equivalent of $50,000 as opposed to $12,500 for some of the accused murderers. At least one of the victims' relatives, Sima Sahebi, the wife of Pouyandeh, was also arrested \\"for publishing a letter criticizing them for not allowing us to hold a memorial of the second anniversary of their death.\\" Investigations Ali Fallahian was intelligence minister at the start of the murders Investigative journalists Emadeddin Baghi and Akbar Ganji both wrote investigative news articles on the murders. In a series of articles in Saeed Hajjarian's Sobh Emrouz daily, Akbar Ganji referred to perpetrators with code names such as \\"Excellency Red Garmented\\" and their \\"Excellencies Gray\\" and the \\"Master Key\\". In December 2000, Akbar Ganji announced the \\"Master Key\\" to the chain murders was former Intelligence Minister Hojjatoleslam Ali Fallahian. He \\"also denounced by name some senior clerics, including Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi for having encouraged or issued fatwas, or religious orders for the assassinations.\\" A number of government officials, including Mostafa Tajzadeh, the political deputy of the Ministry of State, emphatically rejected this view. :\\"Among the prominent Islamic Republic figures accused by human rights advocates of masterminding the chain murders were Mostafa Pour Mohammadi and Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i, now serving as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Interior and Intelligence ministers, respectively.\\" =Retaliation against investigation= On 12 March 2000, Saeed Hajjarian was shot in the head by an assailant but narrowly escaped death, ending up paralyzed for life. He is \\"believed to have played a key role in bringing about‚Ä¶ damaging disclosures\\" against the sponsors of the chain killings, not only as editor of Sobh Emrouz daily, but as a former deputy minister of intelligence turned reformist. Consequently, \\"some believe that remnants\\" of the chain murder \\"intelligence killer group may have been\\" behind his attempted assassination. At about the same time, Akbar Ganji attended the Iran After the Elections conference in Berlin. Upon return he was arrested and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, to be followed by five years in exile (later reduced to six years imprisonment and no exile) for \\"retaining classified documents from the Culture and Islamic Guidance Ministry, insulting the former Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini, and disseminating propaganda against the Islamic system.\\"Iran: Further information on torture/ill-treatment/prisoner of conscience ‚Äì Akbar Ganji Amnesty International, 2001 His time in prison included hunger strikes and courtroom displays of torture marks. Baghi was sentenced to three years in prison in 2000 and served two years. =Explanation= The killings have been blamed on forces trying to put a stop to the Iranian reform movement and its effort to create \\"cultural and political openness.\\" Shirin Ebadi speculates that the murders were done by a variety of means and surreptitiously to avoid any connection between them and to avoid the attention of the international community.Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening, by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House New York, 2006, p. 131-2 Previous mass killings by the regime \\"had blackened the reputation\\" of the Islamic Republic and hindered Iran's efforts to provide jobs and resources for its growing population and \\"rebuild itself\\" after the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. In the media The events surrounding one of the more infamous assassinations, the Mykonos restaurant assassinations and subsequent trial, were examined by Roya Hakakian in her book Assassins of the Turquoise Palace.

It is approximately west of Great Yarmouth, and north-east of Berney Arms on the northern edge of Breydon Water. The structure is a Grade II listed building. History The current mill at this location was built somewhere between 1800 and 1825 under the name 'Freethorpe Mill', it is four stories high and built of red brick tarred black. The structure stands at 35 feet to the curb and the diameter of the base is 24 feet, housing two doors and 4 windows. A farm once stood next to the mill, it was known as Lockgate Farm and was demolished in 1981 after many years of being derelict. When operational, the mill was driven by four patent sails that turned in a clockwise direction, these drove a 19 ft diameter external scoopwheel with 7 inch paddles. Unusually for a mill on the halvergate marshes it didn't drain into the Halvergate Fleet even though it is only 800 yards from the connection of the fleet with Breydon water. Instead it drained Acle marshes that lie to the north of the mill. The earliest recorded marshman of the mill was a Mr Dan Banham, followed subsequently by Mr Bob Banham. The Banham family ceased working the mill in the early 1920s and was taken over for a short period by Mr Gordon Addison, who lived in the nearby Lockgate Farm. The final marshman that worked the mill was Mr Leonard Carter, who left the mill in the mid-1940s. After Leonard Carter left the mill, it began to fall into disrepair. In 1953 the sails were blown off the mill in a gale and was left to deteriorate until a temporary aluminium cap was fitted in 1988 to protect the remains of the mill. Today In 2001 a fire started by vandals damaged the inside of the mill and has blackened some of the external and internal brickwork. The mill can be reached on the Weavers' Way and Wherryman's Way footpaths between Yarmout and Berney Arms. Access to the mill is prohibited and a fence blocks access due to the unsafe state the structure is in.

This was the first time the country took part in a Summer Olympics. The delegation consisted of four athletics competitors: sprinters Gustavo Envela and Secundino Borabota, and middle-distance runners Bartolom√© Esono Asumu and Diosdado Lozano. All four failed to advance beyond the initial heats in their respective competitions. The best performance came from Envela who placed fifth in the eighth heat of the men's 100 metres. Background The Equatoguinean Olympic Committee was formed in 1980 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on 1 January 1984. The 1984 Los Angeles Summer Games were the first Olympics, Summer or Winter, Equatorial Guinea ever participated in after it accepted a formal invitation from the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee. As of the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, the country has yet to debut in the Winter Olympics. Equatorial Guinea took part in the 1984 Summer Olympics from 28 July to 12 August. The Equatoguinean delegation to Los Angeles consisted of a group of four athletics competitors: sprinters Gustavo Envela and Secundino Borabota, and middle-distance runners Bartolom√© Esono Asumu and Diosdado Lozano. The team was funded by a subsidy from the IOC. Borabota was chosen to be the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Athletics (track and field) The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where the Equatoguinean delegation competed in athletics competitions. At the age of 16, Gustavo Envela was the youngest person to represent Equatorial Guinea at the Los Angeles Games. He was drawn to compete in the eighth heat of the first round in the men's 100 metres on 3 August. Envela placed fifth out of eight sprinters with a time of 10.79 seconds. Since the top three in a heat, plus the next six overall fastest athletes progressed to the second round, that was the end of his participation in the men's 100 metres. Three days later, Envela took part in the first round of the men's 200 metres and was assigned heat eight along with seven other runners. He finished this race in a time of 22.14 seconds, which was seventh out of eight competitors. This was not sufficient for Envela to advance to the second round. Envela would go on to compete for Equatorial Guinea in the next three Summer Olympics and became a political activist after retiring. 23 year old Secundino Borabota was the oldest athlete to compete for Equatorial Guinea at the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics. On 4 August, he took part in the first round of the men's 400 metres. Assigned to the third heat and starting from lane two, Borabota, unfamiliar with the rule that all runners had to stay in their lane during the sprint and hurdle races, was observed cutting off Innocent Egbunike of Nigeria on the first turn. While running, Egbunike yelled at Borabota for before he got by him on the inside line and won the heat. Egbunike subsequently called for officials to disqualify Borabota, which they did. Afterwards, Borabota explained he switched lanes inadvertently because of an injury he sustained and remarked, \\"Lane one is a good lane.\\" Nevertheless, Borabota represented Equatorial Guinea at the 1988 Summer Olympics. Bartolom√© Esono Asumu was 21 years old at the time of the 1984 Games and was competing in his first Summer Olympics. His only race was the men's 800 metres, which he took part in the first round on 3 August. Asumu finished seventh and last in the seventh heat in a time of two minutes and 17.29 seconds. As the top three from each heat plus the next five fastest from all nine heats advanced to the second round, he was eliminated as his qualifying time was the slowest overall. Diosdado Lozano was 20 years old at the time of these Summer Games and was making his Olympic debut. His only event was the men's 1500 metres, and on 9 August he was assigned to run in the second round's sixth heat. The top three in a heat, plus the next five overall fastest athletes advanced to the quarterfinals. Lozano finished his heat in a time of four minutes and 34.71 seconds and was eliminated from further contention as it placed him tenth and last of all the finishing runners. ;Key *Note‚ÄìRanks given for track events are within the athlete's heat only *N/A = Round not applicable for the event ;Track and road events {class=wikitable style=font-size:90% - !rowspan=2Athletes !rowspan=2Events !colspan=2Round 1 !colspan=2Round 2 !colspan=2Semifinal !colspan=2Final - !scope=\\"col\\"Time !scope=\\"col\\"Rank !scope=\\"col\\"Time !scope=\\"col\\"Rank !scope=\\"col\\"Time !scope=\\"col\\"Rank !scope=\\"col\\"Time !scope=\\"col\\"Rank -align=center align=left rowspan=2Gustavo Envela 100 metres 10.79 5 align=center colspan=6Did not advance -align=center 200 metres 22.14 7 colspan=6Did not advance -align=center align=leftSecundino Borabota 400 metres colspan=2 align=center colspan=6Did not advance -align=center align=leftBartolom√© Esono Asumu 800 metres 2:17.29 7 align=center colspan=6Did not advance -align=center align=leftDiosdado Lozano 1500 metres colspan=2 4:34.71 10 align=center colspan=4Did not advance } References External links *Official Olympic Reports Category:Nations at the 1984 Summer Olympics 1984 Olymp ","title":"Equatorial Guinea at the 1984 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"7970153","text":"Equatorial Guinea competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.

Its purpose was to provide an education for the children of foreign missionaries and the foreign business and diplomatic communities in China.  Principles and practice Chefoo School was operated as a part of the China Inland Mission agency. Staff of the school were required to be full members of the C.I.M.. The curriculum was based on the British education system, heavily emphasizing classical courses designed to prepare students for entrance to British universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. Christian education was also a focus. The Principal led prayers daily, and there were two services each Sunday. The school year had four terms beginning in February, April, August and October. The school also competed in sports such as soccer and rowing. School magazines included Lux Tenebris in 1887, and The Magnet in the 1920s, and The Chefusian begun in 1928, and continued until 1942.  Origins and development The school was connected to a sanatorium for missionaries when it began, but eventually became larger than the hospital itself. Mr W L Elliston began to teach the first three pupils in 1881. This included two sons of pioneer missionary Charles Henry Judd. Elliston was also the first Head Master. By 1886, the number of pupils grew to over 100, and there were three departments‚Äîthe Boys', Girls' and Preparatory School. In 1886 the Boys' and Girls' schools were separated. The children of China Inland Mission workers alone numbered over 200 children by 1894. In 1895 a Preparatory School for children aged 5‚Äì10 was opened in premises owned by the Mission at Tong-Hsin, three miles away. In 1896 a new Boys' School was built at Chefoo, and enlargements made to the Girls' School, which was opened in 1898. By early 1900, the Preparatory school had moved closer to the main school once more. From 1909-1915, another Preparatory school operated in Lushan (Kuling), Jiangxi, in central China. Under Head Master Pat Bruce, that there were some significant changes at Chefoo such as the introduction of co-education in 1934; the construction of a new teaching and preparatory bloc in the same year; the creation of the Chefoo Orchestra in 1930; the teaching of Chinese Studies; and the beginning of a Girl Guides company. In 1936, Chefoo School adopted the Chinese dolphin as its crest.  The Second World War displaces the school In 1937 Japan invaded China and Japanese Army entered Chefoo in February 1938. British and American citizens were considered as 'neutrals' at first. The school routine was not disrupted very much. Then came December 7, 1941, with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Bruce was soon arrested and the Japanese Army took control of the school property. In November 1942, staff and remaining students were interned at the Temple Hill Japanese Internment Camp. The Chefoo Girls' School circa 1893 left left left In summer 1943, they were moved to Weihsien Internment Camp, where they remained until the camp was liberated by American paratroopers. Their fellow internee, Eric Liddell died there before the end of the war. The Americans landed on August 17, 1945, just outside the gates of the ‚ÄúWeihsien Civilian Assembly Center‚Äù. Three days before, the Japanese had announced their surrender, but another two weeks would pass before the surrender papers were signed. The paratroopers were sent by the Office of Strategic Services the forerunner of the CIA, to liberate 1,400 captives taken by the Japanese during the war. Unable to land at the camp because of the guards, they made a low drop from a B-24 into a nearby cornfield. A Salvation Army band began playing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" and the prisoners hoisted their rescuers onto their shoulders. Suddenly, unexpectedly, the war was over for them, and they were free. Prisoner Mary Previte recalled.  History after WWII After the war, the Communist forces occupied north China and the school never returned to Chefoo. During the war, parts of Chefoo School were temporarily opened at Leshan (Kiating) (1941‚Äì1944), Kalimpong, India (1944‚Äì1946) and Shanghai (1946‚Äì1947). Mr S Houghton (formerly on the staff at Monkton Combe School and who had joined the staff at Chefoo in 1927), became Head Master in 1946, until his sudden death in 1950.Three Score Years and Ten: A Short History of Monkton Combe School by J Walker, 1956 In 1947, the Mission purchased the Kuling American School and students and staff gradually returned. By the first summer, there were 126 students. By May 1949, Communist forces had occupied Kuling. The school continued under their observation until 1951. In 1951 Chefoo School in China ceased to exist. The China Inland Mission decided to withdraw completely from China, a ‚Äúreluctant exodus‚Äù. Staff and students of Chefoo School withdrew to Hong Kong between February and April 1951, where missionary parents waited for their children. Following the redeployment of missionaries throughout east Asia, new Chefoo schools were established in Japan (1951‚Äì1998), Malaya/Malaysia (1952‚Äì2001), Thailand (1952‚Äì1954), Taiwan (1954‚Äì1961), and the Philippines (1956‚Äì1981). Chefoo School Malaysia, which was based on the outskirts of Brinchang at the Cameron Highlands, was the longest running and last surviving post-war Chefoo School when it ceased function as a school in June 2001 due to changes in demographics of mission work; the compound was subsequently transferred to the Methodist Church in Malaysia and has been repurposed as the Methodist Centennial Chefoo Centre, a church-run retreat and hostel opened in 2009 following extensive renovation. The Chefoo Schools Association was founded in 1908 to operate as an association for all former scholars and past and present members of staff of the Chefoo Schools. The association has North American, Australian and New Zealand branches. The president (in 1998) was James Hudson Taylor III. A magazine entitled Chefoo (organ of the Chefoo Schools Association) was first published in 1908, and still continues.

Both are in the public domain with some of the original stories having been reprinted by AC Comics. Michael Shelby The first Green Mask debuted in Fox's Mystery Men Comics #1 (August 1939). The writer was not credited (although it may have been Will Eisner); the artwork was by Walter Frehm. This Green Mask's final appearance was in Mystery Men Comics #31 (February 1942). Originally, the Green Mask really is a mystery man; the secret identity of this \\"modern Robin Hood\\" is kept from the readers for his earliest appearances and known only to reporter \\"News\\" Doakes (later \\"News\\" Blake), who is the only one who can contact the pulp-style costumed vigilante when needed. With the start of the solo Green Mask title in Summer 1940, the character was retooled. The hero is revealed to be Michael Shelby (or Selby, in some early stories), a wealthy private investigator and son of a crusading Senator murdered by white-hooded gangsters known as the Grim Circle. He is transformed into a super-powered \\"Miracle Man\\" (no relation) after being exposed to an experimental \\"vita-ray\\" machine created by family friend Professor Lascomb. In Green Mask #1 (1940), he's joined by a young orphan named Don who, after surviving an explosion meant for the Green Mask, is taken in by the hero and becomes his non-powered, boomerang-throwing sidekick, Domino the Miracle Boy, wearing a costume almost identical to his own. Eventually, Shelby leaves behind his playboy lifestyle when he meets girlfriend Olivia Tracy on a case in Green Mask #6 (1941). According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"The Green Mask fights Yellow Peril Tong lords, hooded master criminals, counterfeiters, crime syndicates, mummies, and hunchbacked mad scientists.\\" In Project Superpowers, Domino makes an appearance in the second series as part of a team of former sidekicks known as the Inheritors. The Green Mask does not appear. =Powers and abilities= Originally, the first Green Mask had no superpowers. Despite this, the first issue of his series retconned his origin so that he became the Green Mask after gaining a number of superpowers after being exposed to vita-rays, including superhuman strength and the ability to fly. He would occasionally display other powers like invulnerability, usually as required by the plot. In addition to super powers, the Green Mask carried a gun (usually a revolver or an automatic, although he briefly used a \\"paralyzer pistol\\" he had confiscated from a mad scientist) for those times when being super was just not enough. Johnny Green Fox Feature re-introduced the Green Mask moniker in issue #10 of The Green Mask (August 1944); the artist and writer were uncredited. In this version, the Green Mask is secretly Johnny Green. He is the son of a previous Green Mask, named Walter Green. Johnny is a meek bespectacled teenager often taunted as a \\"sissy boy\\" by his high school peers who transforms into an adult \\"Avenger of Wrong\\" whenever he becomes angry and cries out at any display of injustice (\\"Eee-ow!\\"), changing back once he has finished beating up the bad guys, grows tired and yawns (making him a sort of cross between Captain Marvel and the Hulk). While some stories have him aware of his alter-ego, others indicate that he either doesn't retain the memory of anything he did while transformed or perceives them as only a dream. The motherless Johnny lives in a rented room above the exclusive Miramar Club while his father is off serving in the army in Europe; he survives on his father's savings and the kindness of the club's owner, Punchy. He has a dog named Curly and a much more outgoing and courageous girlfriend named Suzie who's unaware of his dual identity. The second Green Mask's final appearance was in The Green Mask #17 (October‚ÄìNovember 1946). = Powers and abilities = Johnny Green transforms into the adult Green Mask whenever he becomes angry, gaining all the powers of the previous Green Mask.

It is situated at Kennady Lake (), in the Akaitcho Treaty 8 TerritoryGahcho Ku√© Project Exploration Camp Project Description claim block, which is southeast of the Snap Lake Diamond Mine and approximately east northeast of Yellowknife. The site is served by Gahcho Kue Aerodrome, which has both an ice runway in winter and a year-round gravel runway, and a spur of the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road from Lupin Mine. the main camp is at , north of the ice strip, with a smaller site at , south of the runway. Background The Gahcho Ku√© Diamond Mine is a 49% / 51% joint-venture between Mountain Province Diamonds and De Beers Canada.Mountain Province Diamonds Mountain Province claims 49% and De Beers claims 51%. The mine, which opened officially on 20 September 2016, consists of the Gahcho Ku√© kimberlite pipes, which lie underneath Kennady Lake. There are also several unexplored kimberlite occurrences scattered over several kilometres. History In 1993, Canamera Geological began sampling and surveying the area for Mountain Province Mining Joint Venture (now Mountain Province Diamonds). Exploration began in the area with a camp being set up in 1995. In 1997, Monopros, now De Beers Canada, took over the camp when they joined the Mountain Province Mining Joint Venture. In 1998 De Beers began sampling the kimberlite to evaluate the four Gahcho Ku√© pipes. More drilling followed and the positive results led to the decision to proceed. Project development A project study was started in 2004. An evaluation program in 2006 was followed by a drilling and sampling program in 2007. In September 2009 a feasibility study on a proposed mine was started, which was completed in September 2010. De Beers and its partners approved it in June 2011 and are preparing a plan and budget for a final decision on whether to go ahead with the mine project.Gahcho Ku√© factsheet \\"About Gahcho Kue\\" , De Beers Canada website. If it proceeds to an operating mine, is expected to annually mine of kimberlite, and to produce per year over an 11-year life. In 2005, the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board (MVEIRB), after an initial environmental assessment, ruled that De Beers applications for a land use permit and water license would require a full Environment Impact Review. De Beers appealed this decision to the NWT Supreme Court, but was denied in April 2007, and the review process began in 2007. Due to economic factors, De Beers delayed filing the required Environment Impact Statement (EIS) to the review board and the review process was suspended in May 2010. De Beers gave notice in November and filed the EIS on 23 December 2010, and after some subsequent revisions to address a few deficiencies, the MVEIRB accepted it on 26 July 2011. Staff sessions began in November, and the panel's decision is expected by July 2013. Should it proceed after that, mine construction would take two years at a cost of around C$650‚Äì750 million. Traditional use Gahcho Ku√© is the traditional Chipewyan, a Dene people, name for the Kennady Lake area and in Dene Suline means \\"Place of the Big Rabbit\\". The area, also known for Barren-ground caribou, has been traditionally used by Dene from ≈Åutselk'e and the M√©tis of Fort Resolution.

Neyman and Pearson's 1933 result inspired Wald to reformulate it as a sequential analysis problem. The Neyman-Pearson lemma, by contrast, offers a rule of thumb for when all the data is collected (and its likelihood ratio known). While originally developed for use in quality control studies in the realm of manufacturing, SPRT has been formulated for use in the computerized testing of human examinees as a termination criterion.Ferguson, Richard L. (1969). The development, implementation, and evaluation of a computer-assisted branched test for a program of individually prescribed instruction. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Pittsburgh.Reckase, M. D. (1983). A procedure for decision making using tailored testing. In D. J. Weiss (Ed.), New horizons in testing: Latent trait theory and computerized adaptive testing (pp. 237-254). New York: Academic Press. Theory As in classical hypothesis testing, SPRT starts with a pair of hypotheses, say H_0 and H_1 for the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis respectively. They must be specified as follows: :H_0: p=p_0 :H_1: p=p_1 The next step is to calculate the cumulative sum of the log-likelihood ratio, \\\\log \\\\Lambda_i, as new data arrive: with S_0 = 0, then, for i=1,2,..., :S_i=S_{i-1}+ \\\\log \\\\Lambda_i The stopping rule is a simple thresholding scheme: * a < S_i < b: continue monitoring (critical inequality) * S_i \\\\geq b: Accept H_1 * S_i \\\\leq a: Accept H_0 where a and b (a<0) depend on the desired type I and type II errors, \\\\alpha and \\\\beta. They may be chosen as follows: a \\\\approx \\\\log \\\\frac{ \\\\beta }{1-\\\\alpha} and b \\\\approx \\\\log \\\\frac{1-\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha} In other words, \\\\alpha and \\\\beta must be decided beforehand in order to set the thresholds appropriately. The numerical value will depend on the application. The reason for being only an approximation is that, in the discrete case, the signal may cross the threshold between samples. Thus, depending on the penalty of making an error and the sampling frequency, one might set the thresholds more aggressively. The exact bounds are correct in the continuous case. Example A textbook example is parameter estimation of a probability distribution function. Consider the exponential distribution: :f_\\\\theta(x)= \\\\theta^{-1} e^{-\\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta}}, \\\\qquad x,\\\\theta>0 The hypotheses are :\\\\begin{cases} H_0: \\\\theta=\\\\theta_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ H_1: \\\\theta=\\\\theta_1\\\\end{cases} \\\\qquad \\\\theta_1>\\\\theta_0. Then the log- likelihood function (LLF) for one sample is :\\\\begin{align} \\\\log \\\\Lambda(x)&= \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1^{-1} e^{-\\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta_1}}}{\\\\theta_0^{-1} e^{-\\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta_0}}} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_0}{\\\\theta_1} e^{\\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta_0} - \\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta_1}} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_0}{\\\\theta_1} \\\\right) + \\\\log \\\\left (e^{\\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta_0} - \\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta_1}} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -\\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1}{\\\\theta_0} \\\\right ) + \\\\left (\\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta_0} - \\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta_1} \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -\\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1}{\\\\theta_0} \\\\right ) + \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1-\\\\theta_0}{\\\\theta_0 \\\\theta_1}\\\\right ) x \\\\end{align} The cumulative sum of the LLFs for all is :S_n=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\log \\\\Lambda(x_i)= - n \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1}{\\\\theta_0} \\\\right ) + \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\theta_1-\\\\theta_0}{\\\\theta_0 \\\\theta_1} \\\\right)\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i Accordingly, the stopping rule is: :a<\\\\- n \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1}{\\\\theta_0} \\\\right ) + \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\theta_1-\\\\theta_0}{\\\\theta_0 \\\\theta_1} \\\\right ) \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i After re-arranging we finally find :a+n \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1}{\\\\theta_0} \\\\right ) < \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1-\\\\theta_0}{\\\\theta_0 \\\\theta_1} \\\\right ) \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i < b+n \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\theta_1}{\\\\theta_0} \\\\right ) The thresholds are simply two parallel lines with slope \\\\log ( \\\\theta_1/\\\\theta_0 ). Sampling should stop when the sum of the samples makes an excursion outside the continue-sampling region. Applications =Manufacturing= The test is done on the proportion metric, and tests that a variable p is equal to one of two desired points, p1 or p2. The region between these two points is known as the indifference region (IR). For example, suppose you are performing a quality control study on a factory lot of widgets. Management would like the lot to have 3% or less defective widgets, but 1% or less is the ideal lot that would pass with flying colors. In this example, p1 = 0.01 and p2 = 0.03 and the region between them is the IR because management considers these lots to be marginal and is OK with them being classified either way. Widgets would be sampled one at a time from the lot (sequential analysis) until the test determines, within an acceptable error level, that the lot is ideal or should be rejected. =Testing of human examinees= The SPRT is currently the predominant method of classifying examinees in a variable-length computerized classification test (CCT). The two parameters are p1 and p2 are specified by determining a cutscore (threshold) for examinees on the proportion correct metric, and selecting a point above and below that cutscore. For instance, suppose the cutscore is set at 70% for a test. We could select p1 = 0.65 and p2 = 0.75 . The test then evaluates the likelihood that an examinee's true score on that metric is equal to one of those two points. If the examinee is determined to be at 75%, they pass, and they fail if they are determined to be at 65%. These points are not specified completely arbitrarily. A cutscore should always be set with a legally defensible method, such as a modified Angoff procedure. Again, the indifference region represents the region of scores that the test designer is OK with going either way (pass or fail). The upper parameter p2 is conceptually the highest level that the test designer is willing to accept for a Fail (because everyone below it has a good chance of failing), and the lower parameter p1 is the lowest level that the test designer is willing to accept for a pass (because everyone above it has a decent chance of passing). While this definition may seem to be a relatively small burden, consider the high-stakes case of a licensing test for medical doctors: at just what point should we consider somebody to be at one of these two levels? While the SPRT was first applied to testing in the days of classical test theory, as is applied in the previous paragraph, Reckase (1983) suggested that item response theory be used to determine the p1 and p2 parameters. The cutscore and indifference region are defined on the latent ability (theta) metric, and translated onto the proportion metric for computation. Research on CCT since then has applied this methodology for several reasons: #Large item banks tend to be calibrated with IRT #This allows more accurate specification of the parameters #By using the item response function for each item, the parameters are easily allowed to vary between items. =Detection of anomalous medical outcomes= Spiegelhalter et al.Risk- adjusted sequential probability ratio tests: application to Bristol, Shipman and adult cardiac surgery Spiegelhalter, D. et al Int J Qual Health Care vol 15 7-13 (2003) have shown that SPRT can be used to monitor the performance of doctors, surgeons and other medical practitioners in such a way as to give early warning of potentially anomalous results. In their 2003 paper, they showed how it could have helped identify Harold Shipman as a murderer well before he was actually identified. Extensions =MaxSPRT= More recently, in 2011, an extension of the SPRT method called Maximized Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MaxSPRT) was introduced. The salient feature of MaxSPRT is the allowance of a composite, one-sided alternative hypothesis, and the introduction of an upper stopping boundary. The method has been used in several medical research studies.2nd to last paragraph of section 1: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07474946.2011.539924 A Maximized Sequential Probability Ratio Test for Drug and Vaccine Safety Surveillance Kulldorff, M. et al Sequential Analysis: Design Methods and Applications vol 30, issue 1 See also *CUSUM *Computerized classification test *Wald test *Likelihood-ratio test References  Further reading  * * Holger Wilker: Sequential-Statistik in der Praxis, BoD, Norderstedt 2012, .

This includes morphological and functional changes (the decidual reaction) to endometrial stromal cells (ESCs), the presence of decidual white blood cells (leukocytes), and vascular changes to maternal arteries. The sum of these changes results in the endometrium changing into a structure called the decidua. In humans, the decidua is shed during the third phase of birth. Decidualization plays an important role in promoting placenta formation between a mother and her fetus by mediating the invasiveness of trophoblast cells. It also triggers the production of cellular and molecular factors that result in structural changes, or remodeling, of maternal spiral arteries. Decidualization is required in some mammalian species where embryo implantation and trophoblast cell invasion of the endometrium occurs, also known as hemochorial placentation. This allows maternal blood to come into direct contact with the fetal chorion, a membrane between the fetal and maternal tissues, and allows for nutrient and gas exchange. However, decidualization-like reactions have also been observed in some species that don't display hemochorial placentation. In humans, decidualization occurs after ovulation during the menstrual cycle. After implantation of the embryo, the decidua further develops to mediate the process of placentation. In the event no embryo is implanted, the decidualized endometrial lining is shed or, as is the case with species that follow the estrous cycle, absorbed. In menstruating species, decidualization is spontaneous and occurs as a result of maternal hormones. In non-menstruating species, decidualization is non-spontaneous, meaning it only happens after there external signals from an implanted embryo.  Overview  After ovulation, the high levels of progesterone initiate the molecular changes leading to decidualization. The process triggers an influx of decidual leukocytes along with morphological and functional changes of ESCs. The changes in the ESCs result in the endometrium developing a secretory lining that produces a variety of proteins, cytokines, and growth factors. These secreted factors will regulate the invasiveness of trophoblast cells that eventually form the placental connection if an embryo implants into the decidua. = Decidual leukocytes = One of the identifying features of the decidua is the presence of large numbers of leukocytes that are mostly made up of specialized uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and some dendritic cells. As the fetus consists of both maternal and paternal DNA, the decidual leukocytes play a role in suppressing the immune response of the mother to prevent treating the fetus as genetically foreign. Outside of their immune functions, the uNK cells and dendritic cells also act as regulators of maternal spiral artery remodeling and ESC differentiation. = Endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) = ESCs are the connective tissue cells of the endometrium that are fibroblastic in appearance. However, decidualization causes them to swell up and adopt an epithelial cell-like appearance due to the accumulation of glycogen and lipid droplets. Furthermore, they begin secreting cytokines, growth factors, and proteins like IGFBP1 and prolactin, along with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin and laminin. The increased production of these ECM proteins turns the endometrium into the dense structure known as the decidua, which produces factors that promote trophoblast attachment and inhibit overly aggressive invasion. During pregnancy The decidual reaction is seen in very early pregnancy in the generalized area where the blastocyst contacts the endometrial decidua. It consists of an increase in secretory functions of the endometrium at the area of implantation, as well as a surrounding stroma that becomes edematous.T. F. Kruger, M. H. Botha. Clinical Gynaecology; page 67. Juta Academic; 3rd edition (September 5, 2008). The decidual reaction occurs only in a few species such as humans. The decidual reaction and decidua are not required for implantation. Evidence can be taken from the fact that in ectopic pregnancy, implantation can occur anywhere in the abdominal cavity. Even after hysterectomy some women have become pregnant.  Role in diseases and disorders  Abnormalities in decidualization have been implicated in diseases such as endometriosis, in which impaired decidualization leads to ectopic uterine tissue growth. Lack of decidualization has also been linked to higher rates of miscarriage. Chronic deciduitis, a chronic inflammation of the decidua, has been linked with premature birth.  In research  The decidualization process is initiated by progesterone, but this requires cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to act as the initial signalling molecule to sensitize endometrial cells to progesterone. Consequently, human ESCs have been decidualized in culture with chemical analogs of cAMP and progesterone together. In vitro decidualization results in similar morphological changes to the human ESCs as well as upregulated production of decidualization markers such as IGFBP1 and prolactin. Mouse models have been extensively used for the identification of the molecular factors required for and involved in decidualization.

Maraval is one of the northern suburbs of Trinidad's capital, Port of Spain, a valley in northern Trinidad in Trinidad and Tobago. It is situated at the bottom of the hills of Paramin and located east of the Diego Martin valley to which it is connected directly by Morne Coco Road, and west of Santa Cruz valley, to which it is connected by Saddle Road. Description St. Andrew's Golf Course, Maraval, Port of Spain. 1949 Maraval is considered one of the major high-income residential areas in the country, and, in combination with the Westmoorings/Goodwood Park/ Glencoe area, is home of much of the island's elite, including a number of diplomats. Some of the highest income enclaves within Maraval are Champs Elysees, Fairways, Andalucia, Haleland Park, La Seiva and Moka, with many properties in these neighbourhoods commanding prices in excess of US$2.5 million. Maraval is sometimes referred to as \\"Diego Martin East\\". It is home to Trinity College secondary school and St. Andrew's Golf Course/Club which is considered to be one of the finest golf courses in the Caribbean that was established in 1891 making it one of the oldest in the world. It arguably provides the best route of access from the capital to the North Coast. Along with Santa Cruz, Maraval is located close to the best beaches on the island, allowing its residents quick access to both leisure activities, as well as downtown business and entertainment.  Entertainment and popular culture  Maraval is also the home to many restaurants, shops, late-night cafes, and nightclubs. Business and banking =Banks= Maraval has branches of the major locally-operating banks, Republic Bank such as Scotiabank and well as RBTT, so residents do not have to go downtown to conduct business. =Churches and parish groups= There are church buildings located along the Saddle Road, Maraval, within one hundred yards of each other. These are: Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church which falls under the title R.C. Archdiocese of Port of Spain - Parish of Maraval. Within the Catholic Church there are beautiful stained glass windows, one of which acts as a remembrance to a Roman Catholic priest, a Fr. \\"Alvarez\\", who died close to one hundred years ago. The property is quite large and includes a Parish Hall and other buildings which will be covered in this section. There is a Presbytery which is attached to the Parish Office which is located at the front of the compound. The buildings on the compound appears to be quite old. Over the years there have been modifications to the Presbytery/ Office which have allowed the Parish Office to continue to meet the needs of the public. Air conditioning units have been added and several of the open areas have been \\"closed off\\" to facilitate the preservation of the building and its contents. Located in the Parish Hall are a Soup Kitchen which is managed by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul - Maraval Conference and which offers meals to the public. Also offered to the public are gently used items of clothing for persons of all ages and sizes. Other groups belonging to the Catholic church meet on the compound and offer services to the parishioners and the public, such as the Kids Klub, Gentle Doves and Rite of Christian Initiation (RCIA). A Seventh Day Adventist Church is also located in this area. =Catholic schools= There are at least two Catholic schools located in the area of Maraval. These are La Seiva Catholic Primary School and Maraval R.C. School. Both primary schools serve the children of the area. The Maraval R.C. School is located in the compound of the Roman Catholic Presbytery and Parish Office, however it is located on level of the church, (Our Lady of Lourdes). =Supermarkets, greengrocers= There are two outlets of the Massy Stores which are located at either end of the Saddle Road in Maraval. Each outlet was designed to cater to the needs of the area and to suit a marketing strategy designed to offer goods and services to the population yet retain the culture of the area which is to allow the small business owner to thrive. There are several greengrocers which are established throughout the area of Maraval, many of which have been long established. Some of the greengrocers are situated to allow the vehicles to pull off the main road either in front of the establishment or a little way off to purchase items and merge into the roadway with ease, except during the busy hours when this may be a bit more difficult. =Boutiques, clothing outlets= There are several clothing outlets which are located along the Saddle Road Stretch and are positioned either in mini malls or as individual stores. Some of these stores are positioned to cater to special events such as weddings, Christmas and Easter, while some of the other clothing stores are positioned to cater to the daily needs of the average individual. =Pharmacies= There are several pharmacies located throughout Maraval, from SuperPharm to the smaller pharmacy. All of the pharmacies have evolved to offer stationary and other items to meet the needs of the Sunday nighter who is preparing for school and needs an item for Monday. =Cemetery= Within the compound of the Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church is a cemetery which is quite old. The cemetery is located above the church and the school and appears to stretch to the sky. The cemetery has been built to cater to the needs of the parish from then to now as there are more than five hundred plots on the site. Grave markers from the past have been retained and allow for a glimpse into the history of Trinidad and Tobago.  Other  As with many urban and suburban areas in Trinidad, Maraval is prone to flash floods during the rainy season. During this period, houses built along the main roads or close rivers and streams are in danger of being flooded. The West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine included 'Maraval' in his full title when, in 1969, he became a Life Peer and member of the British House of Lords. On February 5, 2015 an El Pecos restaurant in Maraval exploded around 10:45 a.m. The explosion left 13 people severely injured and at least four were in critical condition. The explosion also destroyed the Burger King next to it, and caused millions of dollars in damages]susanmohammedgyasigonzales,13injuredasmaravalrestaurantexplodes,02/05/15 References Category:Landforms of Trinidad and Tobago Category:Populated places in Trinidad and Tobago ","title":"Maraval"},{"id":"7970311","text":"Samuel ben Hofni (Hebrew: ◊©◊û◊ï◊ê◊ú ◊ë◊ü ◊ó◊§◊†◊ô, or full name: ◊®◊ë ◊©◊û◊ï◊ê◊ú ◊ë◊ü ◊ó◊§◊†◊ô ◊í◊ê◊ï◊ü [abbreviation: ◊®◊©◊ë\\"◊ó] or ◊©◊û◊ï◊ê◊ú ◊ë◊ü ◊ó◊§◊†◊ô ◊î◊õ◊î◊ü; also: Samuel b. Hofni or Samuel ha-Kohen ben Hofni; died 1034). He was the Gaon of Sura from 998 to 1012. Biography His father was a Talmudic scholar and chief judge (\\"ab bet din,\\" probably of Fez), one of whose responsa are extant,see Zunz, Ritus, p. 191; Steinschneider, Hebr. Bibl. xx. 132 and on whose death Samuel wrote an elegy. Samuel was the father-in-law of Hai ben Sherira Gaon, who is authority for the statement that Samuel, like many of his contemporaries, zealously pursued the study of non-Jewish literature.Tes·∏•ubot ha-Ge'onim, ed. Lyck, 1864, No. 99. Beyond these few data, nothing is known of the events of Samuel's life. He served as the Gaon of Sura from 998 to 1012, he was later succeed by Dosa ben Saadia. His son Israel ha-Kohen ben Samuel was the last Sura Gaon.  His responsa  Although, as a rule, geonic literature consists mainly of responsa, Samuel ben ·∏§ofni composed but few of these.See Rapoport in Bikkure ha-'Ittim, xi. 90; Julius F√ºrst in Orient, Lit. x. 188; Weiss, Dor, iv. 192, note 2; M√ºller, Maftea·∏•, pp. 168 et seq.; Harkavy, Zikron la-Rishonim, etc., iv. 146, 258; Winter and W√ºnsche, Die J√ºdische Litteratur, pp. 50 et seq.; Schechter, Saadyana, p. 61. This was because the Academy of Sura had for a century occupied a less prominent position than that of Pumbedita, and that, especially in the time of Hai ben Sherira, information was preferably sought at the latter institution. A Cairo genizah fragment of the Taylor-Schechter collection, containing a letter to Shemariah ben Elhanan written, according to Schechter's opinion, by Samuel ben ·∏§ofni, and another letter of Samuel's to Kairwan,J. Q. R. xiv. 308. show the great efforts which at this time the last representative of the Babylonian schools had to make to maintain the ancient seats of learning in Babylonia.Schechter, l.c. p. 121. Samuel's responsa, written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic (those written in Arabic were translated into Hebrew), discuss tefillin, tzitzit, Shabbat and holidays, forbidden and permitted food (kashrut), women, priests, servants, property rights, and other questions of civil law. They consist chiefly of explanations of the Talmud and include some very short halakhic decisions, from which fact it is surmised that they are taken from his Talmud treatise Sha'arei Berakhot.Weiss, l.c. p, 193; Steinschneider, Die Arabische Literatur der Juden, p. 109. With the intellectual independence peculiar to him, he occasionally declares a Talmudic law to be without Biblical foundation, and when an explanation in the Talmud seems inadequate, he adds one of his own which is satisfactory.Sha'are ·∫íede·∏≥, i. 305. Samuel wrote Madkhal ila 'al- Talmud (Hebrew title, \\"Mevo haTalmud\\"), an Arabic introduction to the Talmud which is known only through citations from it made by Abu al-Walid,Kitab al- U·π£ul, ed. Adolf Neubauer, p. 166. Joseph ibn 'A·∏≥nin, and Abraham Zacuto. His treatise concerning the hermeneutic rules in the Talmud is known only by name. Some of Samuel ben ·∏§ofni's teachings, not found in any other sources, have been conveyed in Nathan ben Abraham's Judeo-Arabic Mishnah commentary, supplemented by an anonymous copyist in the 12th-century.Yosef Qafih, \\"Yemenite Jewry's Connections with Major Jewish Centers\\", in: Ascending the Palm Tree ‚Äì An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage, Rachel Yedid & Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 29 The entire work has been translated into Hebrew by Rabbi Yosef Qafih.  Treatises  Samuel's systematic treatises on many portions of the Talmudic law surpassed in number those of his predecessors.

Moreover, Schechter's genizah fragments contain the beginning of an Arabic commentary by Samuel on a Hebrew \\"reshut\\" of Saadia's.Saadyana, pp. 43, 54, where further writings of his previously unknown are mentioned; see also Samuel Poznanski in Zeit. f√ºr Hebr Bibl. vii. 109  As Bible Exegete  The most important work of Samuel, however, was in Bible exegesis. As early a writer as Jonah ibn JanahKitƒÅb al-Luma‚Äò, p. 15 called him a leading advocate of simple, temperate explanation (\\"pesha·π≠\\"), and Abraham ibn Ezra, although finding fault with his verbosity, placed him in the front rank of Bible commentators of the geonic period.see Bacher, Abraham ibn Ezra's Einleitung zu Seinem Pentateuch-Commentar, etc., p. 18 In modern times his significance as a Bible exegete has been given proper appreciation through Harkavy's studies of the manuscripts in the St. Petersburg Library.see Berliner's Magazin, v. 14 et seq., 57 et seq.; Harkavy, l.c. i., iii.; Steinschneider, Hebr. Bibl. xx. 132 et seq. Fragments of Samuel's commentary on the Pentateuch were preserved only in the Leningrad Ms. (St. Petersburg Ms.) and in Mss. from the Cairo Geniza, and which were collected, rendered into a Hebrew translation and published in 1979 by Aaron Greenbaum.  Translations of the Bible  Samuel ben ·∏§ofni wrote, besides, an Arabic translation of the Pentateuch with a commentary, a commentary on some of the Prophets, and perhaps a commentary on Ecclesiastes.see Harkavy, l.c. iii. 24, note 59; Poznanski, l.c. ii. 55, note 5 M. I. Israelsohn has published a portion of Samuel's Pentateuch translation (Gen. xli.-l.) with commentary.Samuelis b. Hofni Trium Sectionum Posteriorum Libri Genesis Versio Arabica cum Commentario, St. Petersburg, 1886 The deficiencies in these edited fragments might be supplied by the citations in Abraham Maimonides' commentary on Genesis and Exodus.Neubauer, Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS. No. 276 The German translation of a specimen of these fragments is given in Winter and W√ºnsche.l.c. ii. 254 The fragments show that Samuel's translation of the Pentateuch was dependent upon, though it was more literal than, that of Saadia, which had been written almost one hundred years earlier. In contrast to Saadia, Samuel gives Hebrew proper names in their original form. Grammatical notes occupy a remarkably small space in his verbose commentary, and his grammatical point of view was that taken by scholars before the time of ·∏§ayyuj. On the other hand, he gives careful consideration to the chronology of Bible accounts, and in explaining a word he gives all its various meanings besides references to its occurrence elsewhere. His source is the midrashic and Talmudic literature, though he specifically mentions only Seder Olam Rabbah and Targum Onkelos.see Bacher in R. E. J. xv. 277, xvi. 106 et seq.  Polemical Writings  Samuel ben ·∏§ofni is mentioned in connection with Saadia and Mu·∏≥amma·π£ as a polemical writer.Steinschneider, Jewish Literature, p. 319 An anti-Karaite work entitled Arayot, on the degrees of relationship, is ascribed to him,F√ºrst, Gesch. des Kar√§ert. ii. 153 but whether correctly or incorrectly is not certain.See the above-mentioned catalogue, Nos. 58-59 Kabalists have assigned to him a Sefer ha-Yashar,Leopold Zunz, S. P. p. 146 and a request directed to Saadia for his decision on oaths.  Theological views  Samuel ben ·∏§ofni is justly called a rationalist.Schreiner, in Monatsschrift, 1886, pp. 315 et seq. In religious matters he considered reason higher than tradition.Harkavy, l.c. note 34 Holding to a belief in the creation of the world out of nothing, he rejected astrology and everything that reason denies. He deliberately placed himself in opposition to Saadia, who had held fast to the belief that the witch of En-dor had brought Samuel to life again, that the serpent had spoken to Eve, and the ass to Balaam, even though he felt himself compelled to explain the wonders by supplying the intermediary agency of angels. Samuel denied these and similar miracles, and, with an irony reminiscent of ·∏§iwi al-Balkhi, he put the question, \\"Why, if they were able to do so at one time, do serpents not speak at present?\\" According to his conception, God changes the natural order of things only when He wishes to verify before all people the words of a prophet.Teshubot ha- Ge'onim, ed. Lyck, No. 99 This view was opposed by his son-in-law Hai Gaon. That in later times he was not termed a heretic, although disparaging criticism was not lacking, was due to his position as gaon.see Weiss, l.c. iv. 198; Menachem Meiri, Bet ha-Be·∏•irah, in Adolf Neubauer, M.

Arabic pop is mainly produced and originated in Cairo, Egypt; with Beirut, Lebanon, as a secondary center. It is an outgrowth of the Arabic film industry (mainly Egyptian movies), also predominantly located in Cairo. Since 2000, various locations in the Gulf countries have been producing Khaleeji pop music. The primary style is a genre that synthetically combines pop melodies with elements of different Arabic regional styles, called ughniyah () or in English \\"Arabic song\\". It uses mainly Western instruments, including electric guitars or electronic keyboards, as well as traditional Middle Eastern instruments like the oud or darbukka. Another characteristic aspect of Arabic pop is the overall tone and mood of the songs. The majority of the songs are in a minor key, and the lyrics tend to focus on longing, melancholy, strife, and generally love issues. Songwriting, recording and distribution formats The road to Arab stardom is very different from the one in the Western world. Traditionally, a certain producer creates the full song from music to lyrics, no matter the talents of the performer. Most music is recorded in studios as is Western Pop music. But also several live albums have been popular, such as with Asalah and Egyptian legend Umm Kulthum. Since the 1990s, most music has been released on CD in the album format. Singles are not released separately, but just airplay is common. There are no official charts or certifications due to the informal nature of the business and bootlegging. Ringtone charts are occasionally made, but due to bootlegging, they are also highly inaccurate. There are several awards in different countries awarded in different ways according to their organizations. In fact, bootlegging is so common that most bootleggers have their own brands. They are so bold that they usually put contact info on the front of the CDs. Bootlegging is such a major problem that most artists cannot rely on royalties for income. Most of the actual musical income comes from ringtone downloads, which is more prevalent than in the West. Other income comes from endorsement deals and live performances. Live performances are mainly brokered through the record label. This includes public concerts, such as at arenas or major media events. However, performances at weddings and private parties are common and well paid, no matter the artist's level of fame. Music TV channels and music shows such as Arabs Got Talent are popular in the Middle East and North Africa, where some 40 Arab music channels exist. Rotana is the most popular company, running six TV channels, a record label, and a roster of more than 100 of the top Arab pop artists. =The business side= There are vast differences between the Western Music business and the Arabic Music business. Unlike in the West, there are rarely managers, agents or PR systems. Record labels are usually mega corporations that control music videos, music channels, and distribution as well as the artists' careers, such as endorsement deals or booking gigs. Music videos generally are similar to videos in the Western world, often with a storyline and dance scenes. Producers, song writers and composers are usually affiliated with certain labels. An aspiring Arab singer creates a video demo and sends them to satellite channels that specialize in that area. It is then up to a record label to see them on such a program and sign them.Several artists have also risen to fame via other forms of exposure ‚Äî either having a famous parent musician (such as Asalah) or having been famous in some other area (such as 'Miss Lebanon' Haifa Wehbe). By means of the Internet and social media, regional cooperation between Arab pop musicians, producers and studios has become more feasible than ever before. Thus, Arab pop or even underground musicians can reach their audiences across the region and beyond.  Artistic expression and public response  Most Arab pop concentrates on romantic themes, hence the frequent use of words like habibi (my darling) and qalbi (my sweetheart). Explicit references to sexuality and topics forbidden by Islam, including alcohol, are rare. So is the overt mention of politics, reflecting the limited democratic rights in the region, but international conflicts such as the Gulf War sometimes inspire songs such as \\"Saddam Saddam\\", a 1991 hit in support of Saddam Hussein. Arab pop music videos are most popular among local youth in the Levant and North Africa. The Gulf countries are well-known to ban or censor music videos they deem inappropriate. Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Tunisia, and Morocco show the least tendency to censor or ban music videos, while Egypt has been known to ban overtly sexual and explicit music videos. Although tame by Western standards, female Arab popstars have been known to cause controversy with their sexuality. Playful lyrics, skimpy costumes, and dancing have led to quite a bit of criticism in the more conservative Islamic circles. Artists such as Lydia Canaan, Samira Said, Nancy Ajram, Nawal El Zoghbi, Latifa, Assala, Amal Hijazi and Haifa Wehbe have all come under fire at one time or another for the use of sexual innuendos in their music. This has led to bans on their music and performances in certain countries; particularly in Haifa's case. Lydia Canaan's provocative costumes made her a sex symbol. The Daily Star wrote: \\"On stage, with her daring looks and style, Canaan became a role model\\".Jinan Jubayli, The Daily Star, No.10,735, March 18, 2002 In 2002, a video by Samira Said called \\"Youm Wara Youm\\" was banned by the Egyptian Parliament for being 'too sexy', similar to Nancy Ajram's music video \\"Akhasmak Ah\\". In addition Amal Hijazi's music video of \\"Baya al Ward\\" was heavily criticised and banned on a few music channels. Such extremes are rare, but such kinds of censorship are not uncommon for Arab female popstars. As in other countries, Arab pop stars also have been engaged in social issues, for example during the COVID-19 pandemic. Audiences of Arabic pop Though particularly popular among the youth and young adult Arab population, Arabic pop has found an audience with older fans as well. Most fans of Arabic pop live in the Arab World, but Arabic pop has also continually charted in Europe since the 1990s, especially in the French Top 20. Arabic pop has fans in communities of immigrants from Arabic speaking countries, particularly in France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the United States. Further fan bases come from DJs playing Arabic pop in dance venues or from Western belly dance fans. In Australia, SBS Radio plays Arab pop on a radio format called PopAraby.http://www.sbs.com.au/shows/poparaby/ Many artists speak several languages and have songs in various languages, especially French and Spanish. History of Arabic pop =Early days: 1920s‚Äì1950s= The early days of Arabic pop featured a more traditional style of music. Artists such as Umm Kulthum, who is now considered an Arabic music legend, made it acceptable for female singers to perform in public. In some cases, the performers wrote their own lyrics, but the music was written by others. Both lyrics and music were in characteristic Arabic styles, and songs tended to last well over 10‚Äì30 minutes. Several of Umm Kulthum's songs were measured in hours. Performances were broadcast over the radio, and live tours were organized. The songs could have been compared to Western Jazz for their improvisation and to Opera for their traditional elements and length. = Modernization: 1950s‚Äì1970s = During this period, Arabic pop began to emerge, although the older style of the early days was still extremely popular. Songs began to become more westernized in sound and length (now around 5‚Äì20 minutes). Artists such as Abdel Halim Hafez or the Lebanese superstar Fairuz rose to fame during this period. = 1970s‚Äì1980s = In the 1970s with the rise of Western artists such as ABBA and the death of the early artists such as Umm Kulthum, Arabic pop began to take shape.

Following the breakup of the glam rock / proto - punk band the Berlin Brats in 1976, two years of inactivity followed before Rick Wilder updated his image and sound to more align in the wake of the Los Angeles original punk scene (that had just begun to get off the ground in 1977) and formed the Mau-Mau‚Äôs in 1978. The original line-up from Hollywood, California was Greg Salva on guitar, Roderick Donahue on bass, and Rick Torres on drums. They started out playing at The Masque in Hollywood. Salva was replaced by Mike R. Livingston in 1979 after Salva moved to New York City and Donahue was replaced first by Oscar Harvey and then by Scott Franklin (onetime bassist in The Cramps). Wilder had been chosen to be MC of the Penelope Spheeris movie The Decline of Western Civilization but was dumped after he insisted he be able to say what he really thought of every act before their clip (it was probably not going to be too complimentary). One of the original bands from The Masque era, the Mau-Mau's are conspicuous by their absence from Decline. Wilder‚Äôs eccentric attitude toward the record industry and the legendarily self-destructive lifestyles of himself and his band members guaranteed that no record company would risk finances on the Mau-Mau's. This lack of recorded music contributed towards a long period of obscurity despite being well known by most in the early Los Angeles punk rock scene. The Mau-Mau's can be seen briefly in the movie Rock 'n' Roll High School, have appeared in the movie Cocaine and Blue Eyes starring OJ Simpson, and were included in the compilation Hell Comes to Your House II. Rick Wilder also showed up in The Weeknd's music videos for the songs \\"Tell Your Friends\\", \\"The Hills\\", and \\"Can't Feel My Face\\". He is also the main character in Ariel Pink's music videos for the song \\"Dayzed Inn Daydreams\\". The Mau-Mau‚Äôs long-awaited album Scorched Earth Policies... Then and Now was released by Ratchet Blade Records in 2012. It features The Doors' Robbie Krieger playing guitar on the Wilder-Campbell punk classic, \\"(I'm) Psychotic\\". The album was produced by L.A. punk pioneer Geza X Gideon. Over the years and throughout the Mau-Mau's history, Rick Wilder lived between New York at his sister's apartment (opera singer Aprile Millo) and L.A., giving him the flexibility to work with other musicians and perform shows.

Sargent, CPhoM, USCG. Original caption: \\"American invaders spring from the ramp of a Coast Guard- manned landing barge to wade those last perilous yards to the beach of Normandy. Enemy fire will cut some of them down. Their 'taxi' will pull itself off the sands and dash back to a Coast Guard manned transport for more passengers.\\" Taxis to Hell ‚Äì and Back ‚Äì Into the Jaws of Death is a photograph taken on June 6, 1944, by Robert F. Sargent, a chief photographer's mate in the United States Coast Guard. It depicts soldiers of the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division disembarking from an LCVP (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel) from the U.S. Coast Guard-crewed at Omaha Beach during the Normandy Landings in World War II. The photograph The photograph was taken by Chief Photographer's Mate Robert Sargent during the troop landing phase of Operation Neptune, the naval component of the Operation Overlord Normandy landing commonly known as D-Day. The photograph was taken at 7:40 AM local time. It depicts the soldiers departing the Higgins boat and wading through waist-deep water towards the \\"Easy Red\\" sector of Omaha Beach. The image was one of the most widely reproduced photographs of the D-Day landings. The original photograph is stored by the United States Coast Guard Historian's Office. Background Neptune was the largest combat operation performed by the United States Coast Guard in American history. The Higgins boat depicted in the photograph had departed from the attack transport about from the coast of Normandy at around 5:30 AM. Waves continuously broke over the boat's square bow, and the soldiers inside were drenched in cold ocean water. In all, Samuel Chase lost six landing craft on D-Day; four foundered near the beach, one was \\"impaled\\" by a beach obstacle, and another was sunk by enemy gunfire.  Origin of the phrase  The phrase \\"into the jaws of Death\\" in the photograph's title comes from a refrain in \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\", an 1854 narrative poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson about the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War.  In popular culture  The image was evoked in the 1998 Hollywood film Saving Private Ryan, and appears on the cover of Stanley Lombardo's 1997 English translation of the Iliad as a symbol of the universality of war. The picture was also rendered on the 2017 Call of Duty game Call of Duty: WWII.

Modern mapping shows it to be nearly ten miles long. Its mouth is at an elevation of about above sea level, and its head is at about . This fall was once used to provide waterpower for industry. There exists the remnants of several dams, two of which were taken out during a flood in the 1950s and never repaired.

In addition to small local brooks and streams, the Seven Mile River is fed from Turkey Hill Brook north of town and Cranberry River to the south. This river is part of the Chicopee River Watershed. Seven Mile River bridge in Spencer The seven mile name starts from the length of the river, the bridge is not really 7 miles. History In the 1800s, the Seven Mile River furnished waterpower to industry in Spencer. There were many factories along this river. Now a sewage treatment plant stands alone. At the head of Turkey Hill Brook, a major tributary to the Seven Mile River is Sugden Reservoir. The reservoir was part of Spencer's wire drawing industry and fed the Lower Wire Village Mill, which made card wire. This mill originally belonged to the Prouty Brothers. When sold to Richard Sugden, he improved it by building the Sugden Reservoir on the top of Turkey Hill. The new company's name became Wickwire-Spencer. It remained until after World War II.

Pibiones are used to decorate traditional Sardinian linen bedcovers, historically woven by young Sardinian girls to be included in their dowry (corredo).

It was first discovered in Spring 1988. It was written by a disgruntled programmer and specifically attacks two applications that were under development at his former company. These programs were never released to the public.  Overview  Scores infects the System, Notepad, and Scrapbook files under System 6 and System 7. There is a simple way to identify infection. Normal Notepad and Scrapbook icons will have specific icons under System 7, or little Macintosh icons under System 6. If the icons are blank document icons, it is a good indication the system is infected. Scores begins to spread to other applications two days after infection. The Finder and DA Handler often become infected as well. The second payload, activated after 4 days, will start causing crashes if programs with the ERIC or VULT signatures are run. Both signatures are found on programs written by Electronic Data Systems of Plano, Texas. If a program from the company is run, the virus will crash the system after 25 minutes. The third payload activates after 7 days, and will actively try to stop programs with the VULT signature from writing to disk. If no write to disks happen within 10 minutes, the virus will crash the system. The alleged author of the virus was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) soon after the virus was discovered. There were no federal laws with which to charge the author, so they remain free to this day. This loophole resulted in the \\"Computer Virus Eradication Act of 1988\\". References * Norstad, John.

Illustrated is his painting The Town Is Being Built (1902). Sarskoye Gorodishche or Sarsky fort (, literally \\"Citadel on the Sara\\") was a medieval fortified settlement in the Yaroslavl Oblast of Russia. It was situated on the bank of the Sara River, a short distance from Lake Nero, to the south of modern Rostov, of which it seems to have been the early medieval predecessor.  Exploration  The site first attracted the attention of Russian archaeologists in the mid-19th century by its imposing dimensions which have no parallels in the region. Excavations begun by Count Aleksey Uvarov in 1854 revealed a number of superb Varangian objects comparable to the sites in Scandinavia, notably a Carolingian sword with the inscription \\"Lun fecit\\". Excavations have been undertaken intermittently since that period by many persons, including Nicholas Roerich in 1903. In his diary, Roerich complained that the site had been reduced drastically by road builders. After Soviet archaeologists resumed excavations, they rejected the traditional attribution of the site to the Norsemen, proclaiming it the largest centre (perhaps the capital) of the Merya, a Finnic tribe which inhabited the region prior to the arrival of the Slavs. According to the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia, the Merya township goes back to the 6th century, but its fortifications were constructed by the Slavs in the 10th century. The settlement suffered a decline in the late 10th century but seems to have endured until the 13th century, when it is first mentioned in a major chronicle as \\"Sarskoe Gorodishche\\". Interpretation Major Varangian finds at Sarskoye date from ca. 800 onward, indicating that it was a major (perhaps the most important) trade station on the Volga trade route between Scandinavia and Baghdad. Traces of a bath, an iron foundry, a potter's workshop and a jeweller's shop were encountered. There were two hoards of early 9th-century dirhams. Another deposit was detected in the vicinity: it contained dirhams inscribed with Runic signs, interpreted as a thanksgiving to Thor. Side by side with this evidence of a Scandinavian presence, the native Merya element is strong. For instance, there are numerous beaver symbols made of clay: the beaver was a sacred animal for the Finns. Although cremations were encountered, inhumation is predominant. Like the Slavs and Varangians at Gnezdovo, the Merya and the Norsemen seem to have peacefully co-existed in the 9th and 10th centuries. The settlement appears to have escaped the violent clashes of the Norsemen with the indigenous population, so characteristic of the Ladoga region.  Sarskoe vs Rostov  Rostov as seen from Lake Nero The earliest pavement of Rostov is dated by dendrochronology to 963. These pieces of wood were uncovered in post-1949 digs, throwing much light on the earliest years of the city. At about the same period, the decline of Sarskoe Gorodishche started. Whether the town was simply transferred to a new place remains debatable. It is also not clear if the original Slavic name of Sarskoe Gorodishche was Rostov or something different. The original name of the settlement might have been Arsa (the capital of mysterious Arsania, according to Ibn Hawqal). Historians have experienced difficulty in explaining why the superior location of Sarskoe was abandoned in favor of a boggy site where Rostov now stands. According to one theory, the town was transferred primarily for religious considerations, so as to have the water frontage facing a rocky island with a major sanctuary of Veles. Whatever the reasons for the decline of Sarskoe, the similar sites at Timeryovo near Yaroslavl and Gnezdovo near Smolensk relinquished their administrative and economic primacy roughly in the same period.

Gale co-hosted with John Forsythe from 2010 to 2018, when Forsythe retired after a 50-year career in radio. Each year, the station switches to a Christmas music format from Thanksgiving Day through Christmas Day. WMGF operates out of iHeartMedia's Orlando offices and studios in Maitland. It broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 98,000 watts from a transmitter off Miller Road in Orange City, Florida. The station has two HD Radio signals. The first carries the adult contemporary format and the second airs smooth jazz, informally using the call sign of a past Orlando jazz station, WLOQ. History =WHIY and WORJ= In February 1966, the station first signed on as WHIY, powered at 28,000 watts and owned by the Orlando Radio & TV Company.Broadcasting Yearbook 1968 page B-38 In 1969, Orlando Radio & TV bought WORL Orlando (now WIWA in Eatonville), operating the two stations together from offices and studios in Orlando. In the early 1970s, 107.7 began airing a Top 40 format, switching to the call letters WORJ, standing for \\"Orange,\\" a major crop in Central Florida.Broadcasting Yearbook 1973 page B-43 By the late 70s, the station had switched to an album rock format, calling itself \\"Zeta 7.\\" =Joy 108 WJYO= In 1978, Sudbrink Broadcasting bought the station. In 1981, the call letters switched to WJYO, airing a soft adult contemporary format as Joy 108.Broadcasting Yearbook 1983 page B-52 (The WJYO call sign is now used on a Christian radio station in Fort Myers, Florida at 91.5 FM.) In 1987, the station was bought by Metroplex Communications of Orlando. In 1993, Paxson Communications, owned by Florida millionaire Bud Paxson, bought the station for $5.6 million, coupled with WWZN (now WPRD).Broadcasting Yearbook 1995 page B-87 Paxson changed the call sign to WMGF, calling the station Magic 107.7. Former logo of the radio station used from September 2001 through March 2005 Former logo of the radio station used from April 2005 =Purchase by Clear Channel= In 1997, Clear Channel Communications, a forerunner of iHeartMedia, acquired the station, continuing its Soft AC format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1999 page D-96 On January 25, 2008, it was announced that WMGF would be one of several Clear Channel radio stations to be sold, in order to remain under Federal Communications Commission ownership caps following the sale of Clear Channel to private investors. Those stations would be placed into the Aloha Station Trust. But those plans changed and WMGF remains under iHeart ownership. Former logo of the radio station used from 2009 to July 2014 WMGF was, for a time, an affiliate of the Delilah After Dark and John Tesh syndicated radio shows. Both were dropped in Fall 2010. Nights and weekends, the station adopted Clear Channel's Premium Choice music service. The station's playlist was coordinated with the national Premium Choice playlist around the clock, which gave the station a more uptempo sound. Around Fall 2011, the station had its playlist return to local programming. By March 2012, the station was placed on the Mediabase add board. When Clear Channel had another round of lay-offs in Fall 2012, the station's program director was let go. In 2013, a new PD was hired who organized a playlist of softer 70s, 80s, and 90s hits. By July 2014, the station changed its slogan to \\"More Variety from the 80s to Now.\\" With the new handle, the station eliminated 1970s music, moving to a playlist of 80s, 90s and 2000's music. Starting in 2017, WMGF plays 80s music every Friday from 5 to 10 p.m. Outside of key hours on weekdays, the station is mostly voice- tracked. Although not a Christian music station, WJYO produced a syndicated program on Sunday mornings called \\"Glory of Joy\\", which aired contemporary Christian music. The program continued after the switch to WMGF. Another weekend staple on WMGF is American Top 40: The 80s distributed by Premiere Networks, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia. HD Radio =HD2= WLOQ logo used for WMGF-HD2. WMGF is licensed for HD Radio operations and carries Broadcast Architecture's Smooth Jazz network programming on its HD2 subchannel. In August 2011, the HD2 subchannel began simulcasting on an FM translator at 102.5 MHz. The translator, W273CA, was leased by Clear Channel, calling itself \\"102.5 WLOQ,\\" although those call letters were not officially assigned to the station. The translator restored the smooth jazz format for analog radio listeners in the immediate Orlando area several weeks after the original 103.1 WLOQ dropped the format in favor of Spanish tropical music as WHKQ (now WOTW). W273CA's area of strongest coverage includes the western suburbs of Orlando, including Winter Garden, Pine Hills, Ocoee, and Clermont. The simulcast on 102.5 FM ended on February 12, 2014, when W273CA flipped to a simulcast of co- owned talk radio station WFLF. Smooth Jazz WLOQ continues as the HD2 channel of 107.7 and on the iHeartRadio streaming service on line, although it is no longer available on conventional radios in Orlando.

The city is a part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. According to the 2011 census, the total population of the Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation area was 709,665. History Bhiwandi is a commercial city in the Thane district of Western Maharashtra. Bhiwandi lies in the Konkan coastal lowland with hills and streams. Bhiwandi is well-known as a major trade centre. The city is the major link between Mumbai and the rest of India through Mumbai‚ÄìAgra highway. Bhiwandi has been given the nickname \\"the Manchester of India\\". In the early 16th century, Bhiwandi used to have a port on the Kamwadi River in Bunder Mohalla. Waswoods & Spices were traded the most from the port. During the reign of the Moghul Empire the city of Bhiwandi was known by the name \\"Islamabad\\". There is a mosque named Islamabad Masjid & Eidgah. In the early 20th century, Bhiwandi was a small town and was inhabited mainly by Maharashtrians. Most people worked in agriculture, fishing and weaving. With the introduction of electricity, the hand looms were replaced by power looms. It became a hub of the textile industry in the 1930s. With the decline of the textile industry in Mumbai, Bhiwandi became attractive to textile companies due to the convenience for transport and 24-hour power service. The power loom of Bhiwandi is the second largest power loom after the one in Surat. Bhiwandi produces and transports most of the Power loom for textile industry all over India. The increase in Bhiwandi's population is directly or indirectly related to the power loom industry. The place is also known for its large godowns which are considered Asia's largest.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/how- bhiwandi-has-rebuilt-itself-to-become-a-logistics-hub-for-online- retailers/articleshow/72201341.cms?from=mdr Bhiwandi was initially inhabited by the Kolis and Konkanis who were fishermen that used to live near the Konkan sea coast. Bhiwandi was once a trading town as it had its own port (Bandargah) in Bunder Mohalla. Some of the traditional wooden fishing boats can be seen even today in the Bhiwandi area. The Kolis have their own customs and speak a different dialect of Marathi. Bhiwandi's total population was about 500,000 in 2001. The bulk of the population forms the workforce for a number of textile and other industries. The first textile loom was set up by Khan Saheb Samad Seth in 1927. He told the local people to sell gold and purchase iron. Today the city of Bhiwandi has about 500,000 power looms, though handlooms are few in number.  Business  The city of Bhiwandi, known for its textile industry, has the largest number of power looms and handlooms in the country. The majority of the population is employed in the power loom sector. Bhiwandi developed as an industrial hub for the textile industry in the past, but more recently has hosted other industries and logistics sectors. Bhiwandi is one of Asia‚Äôs biggest warehousing hubs. It is a major contributor to the logistic landscape of Mumbai and India due to close proximity to Nhava Seva port of Mumbai and servicing Mumbai ,India‚Äôs financial capital Many e-commerce companies like Amazon, Flipkart, Reliance, Snapdeal, and FedEx have branches in the city. a warehousing hub dispatching hundreds of thousands of retail and industrial goods to consumers in the financial capital every day.Bhiwandi is the next development region for MMRDA, which has developed other regions such as the Bandra‚ÄìKurla Complex, Mumbai Metro, Monorail Project and Eastern Freeway.

Actors would stage mock gunfights in the Western City or threaten to attack riders on the boat rides. The park's Old Smokey Railroad Line was a narrow gauge railroad using equipment leased from the Edaville Railroad. Another park feature was the Show Bowl, where performers such as Ricky Nelson, Michael Landon, The Modernaires, the Three Stooges, Clayton Moore, Don Ameche, and Cesar Romero appeared. Product placement and branding played a part in some attractions, such as the Grist Mill which featured Pepperidge Farm products and the Pepsi-Cola Diamond Lil Theater.

It is divided into the hamlets of Churchtown, Kingsbridge and Pooltown, which lie within a mile of each other. Luxborough, 'Lolochesberie' in the Domesday Book, means 'stronghold or hill of a man called Lulluc'. Administratively, the civil parish falls within the Somerset West and Taunton local government district and the Somerset shire county, with administrative tasks shared between county, district and parish councils. In 2011, the population of the parish was 237. History Luxborough was part of the hundred of Carhampton. About 100 years ago, people used to mine iron ore around Luxborough. It was taken by train down the West Somerset Mineral Railway's incline to Watchet, beside the Bristol Channel and shipped to Newport. There are the remains of several buildings, including stations, such as Luxborough Road railway station. Luxborough had a new village hall put in a few years ago, and because there is no mobile phone signal in the village, it still has its old telephone box. The village school was closed in 1971 as the result of the three-tier education system introduced in West Somerset. Village children now attend Dunster School. In the 19th century the school was reported to have 200 pupils from the village and the iron mines in the Brendon Hills. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Williton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography The Washford River rises close to the village and flows through the Kingsbridge valley, and Pooltown takes its name from the large number of pools on the river there. The Washford River is joined by one of its tributaries, which flows in the Churchtown valley, starting in the wooded combe called Throat. The village is both on the route of the Coleridge Way and Samaritans Way South West and is located within the Exmoor National Park. Religious sites The Church of St Mary dates from Norman times, but has had the tower added on and it had an extension put on in the 19th century. It is a Grade II listed building A new window was added in 2002.

Five people and a pet dog were killed and a woman was severely wounded. The brothers were arrested and convicted of multiple counts of murder, kidnapping, robbery, and rape. They were both sentenced to death in October 2002. Their vicious crimes created panic in the Wichita area resulting in an increase in the sales of guns, locks, and home security systems.The Wichita Horror, The Brutal Murders by Jonathan and Reginald Carr: The Heartbreak of a City by Denise Noe, Court TV's Crime Library The case has received significant attention because the killers' death sentences have been subject to various rulings related to the use of executions in Kansas. In 2004, the Kansas Supreme Court overturned the state's death penalty law but the Kansas Attorney General appealed to the US Supreme Court which upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty in Kansas. On July 25, 2014, the Kansas Supreme Court again overturned the Carrs' death sentences on a legal technicality relating to their original trial judge not giving each brother a separate penalty proceeding. After an appeal by the state's attorney general to the US Supreme Court, it overturned the decision of the Kansas Supreme Court in January 2016, and reinstated the death sentences.\\"Supreme Court restores death sentences in heinous Kansas murder spree\\", USA Today, January 20, 2016, accessed January 20, 2016 The Carr brothers are incarcerated on death row at El Dorado Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in NE of Wichita.  Crime spree  The Carr brothers were from Dodge City. Both 22-year-old Reginald and 20-year-old Jonathan had lengthy criminal records. On December 8, 2000, having recently arrived in Wichita, they robbed and wounded 23-year-old Andrew Schreiber, an assistant baseball coach. Three days later, on December 11, they shot and mortally wounded 55-year-old cellist and librarian Ann Walenta as she tried to escape from them in her car. She died three days later in hospital from her wounds. On December 14, the brothers broke into a house at 12727 E Birchwood Drive in Wichita. Inside the property, which they had chosen at random, were Brad Heyka, Heather Muller, Aaron Sander, Jason Befort and his girlfriend, a young woman identified as \\"Holly G.\\". Befort was a local high school teacher; Heyka was a director of finance with a local financial services company; Muller was a local preschool teacher; Sander a former financial analyst who had been studying to become a priest; Holly G. was a teacher.State v. Carr, 329 P.3d 1195, 1204 (Kan. 2014). The group, who were all white and in their twenties, were spending the night together. First the Carrs searched the house for valuables. Befort had intended to propose to Holly, and she found this out when the Carrs discovered an engagement ring hidden in a popcorn box. After burgling the house, the Carrs forced their victims to strip naked and then bound them. They then repeatedly raped the two women, and forced the men to engage in sexual acts with the women and the women with each other. After taking the victims in Befort's truck to ATMs to empty their bank accounts, they drove them to the closed Stryker Soccer Complex on the outskirts of Wichita where they shot all five execution-style in the back of their heads. The Carrs then drove Befort's truck over their bodies and left them for dead. Holly G. survived because her plastic barrette deflected the bullet to the side of her head. She walked naked for more than a mile in freezing weather to seek first aid and shelter at a house. Before getting medical treatment, she reported the incident and descriptions of her attackers to the couple who took her in, before the police arrived. After the killings, the Carrs returned to the house to ransack it for more valuables, while there they use a golf club to beat Holly's pet dog Nikki to death.Kansas v. Carr, Nos. 14-449, 14-450, 14-452, slip op. at 5 (U.S. January 20, 2016) (\\"Investigators also testified that the brothers returned to the Birchwood house after leaving the five friends for dead, where they ransacked the place for valuables and (for good measure) beat Holly's dog, Nikki, to death with a golf club\\".) Capture, arrest and conviction Police captured both Carr brothers the next day. Reginald was identified by both Schreiber and the dying Walenta. The District Attorney said that based on evidence they believed their motive was robbery. With the help of Holly's testimony at the trial, both brothers were convicted of nearly all 113 counts against them, including kidnapping, robbery, rape, four counts of capital murder, and one count of first-degree murder. Reginald Carr was convicted of 50 counts and Jonathan Carr of 43. They were each sentenced to death for the capital murders, as well as to life in prison, with decades to serve before being eligible for parole. Their cases were appealed. Death sentence appeals There has been continuing attention for the Carr brothers' case because of various rulings about the Kansas death penalty law and decisions by its high court on such cases. In 2004, the Kansas Supreme Court overturned the state's death penalty law, but the state attorney general appealed this ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. It upheld the constitutionality of the state's death penalty law, which returned the Carrs and other condemned killers to death row. On July 25, 2014, the Kansas Supreme Court announced it had overturned the Carr death sentences on appeal. The six justice-majority said they did so because the trial judge failed to adequately separate the penalty proceedings for each defendant. According to a release from the Kansas Supreme Court public information officer, the court unanimously reversed three of each defendant's four capital convictions because jury instructions on sex-crime-based capital murder were \\"fatally erroneous and three of the multiple-homicide capital murder charges duplicated the first.\\" The high court upheld most of the convictions against each of the brothers despite other purported lower-court errors. The court ruled that the brothers were entitled to separate sentencing trials, as \\"differentiation in the moral culpability of two defendants\\" can cause a jury \\"to show mercy to one while refusing to show mercy to the other.\\" Even if the death penalties were not upheld, each of the Carrs were already sentenced to serve at least \\"70 to 80 years\\" in prison before being eligible for parole. The Kansas Attorney General appealed the high court's ruling to the US Supreme Court, which in March 2015 agreed to hear the Carr brothers' sentencing case, together with another death-penalty case from the state. In January 2016, the United States Supreme Court (in an 8-1 ruling) reinstated the death sentences, overturning the Kansas Supreme Court, deciding that neither the jury instructions which were challenged by the Carrs' legal counsel, nor the combined sentencing proceedings, violated the Constitution.Kansas v. Carr, Nos. 14-449, 14-450, 14-452 (U.S. January 20, 2016).  Criticism of media coverage  The victims were white and the Carr brothers are black, but the District Attorney held that there was no prima facie evidence of a racial crime. Based on the robberies, Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston decided against treating these incidents as hate crimes. Conservative media commentators David Horowitz, Michelle Malkin, and Thomas Sowell said the crimes were downplayed; they felt the national media suppressed the stories due to political correctness.Michelle Malkin, \\"Winona and the Wichita massacre\\", Townhall.com, November 8, 2002. Sowell, an African-American conservative, has said the media has a double standard regarding interracial offenses, tending to play up \\"vicious crimes by whites against blacks\\" but play down \\"equally vicious crimes by blacks against whites\\". Years later, The Wichita Eagle commented that the deaths of four young black people who were murdered by a young black man eight days before the \\"Wichita Massacre\\" in 2000 received less general media coverage than the murders committed by the Carr brothers. In this case, Cornelius Oliver, 19, killed his girlfriend, Raeshawnda Wheaton, 18, at her house, as well as her roommate Dessa Ford, and friends Jermaine Levy and Quincy Williams, who were visiting the women. Oliver shot the men in the back of the head where they sat on a couch. The couple had been known to have a \\"volatile, violent relationship\\". The police arrested Oliver that day; he still had blood on his shoes. Some members of the black community questioned why the murders of the four young blacks was superseded by attention given to the Carr brothers' killing of four young white people. A relative of Wheaton asked, \\"How could one be any worse than the other, if the results [multiple deaths] were the same?\\" The deaths of Wheaton and her friends were characterized by Oliver having had a personal relationship with at least one of his victims, unlike the Carrs who chose their victims at random. In addition, the Carrs committed rapes, as well as other assaults and abuses, to the victims. There was no torture or sexual component in the Wheaton case. Oliver was convicted of the four murders and is serving a life sentence in prison, with no possibility of parole before 2140.

Plot This story is quite similar to Romeo and Juliet. The story centers around two rival ninja clans; the Iga and the Kouga; whose no-hostilities treaty is lifted by retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu to settle a succession dispute within the government concerning which of Ieyasu's grandsons is destined to become the third Tokugawa Shogun. Due to years of selective breeding, the members of Kouga and Iga have all developed inhuman abilities at the cost of several of them being born physically disfigured or otherwise abnormally mutated. At the center of the conflict is Kouga and Iga's two young heirs; Gennosuke and Oboro respectively; who had fallen in love in the hopes of not only bringing their clans together in peace but also to mix the bloodlines of their families so as to undo the genetic damage endured by both.

The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite.

Based upon a series of novels that had launched in 1957, the series starred Anne Francis as female private detective Honey West and John Ericson as her partner, Sam Bolt. 30 half-hour episodes were produced. The entire series is available on DVD. Creation The Honey West character was created by Gloria and Forrest E. ‚ÄúSkip‚Äù Fickling under the pseudonym ‚ÄúG.G. Fickling‚Äù in the late 1950s. Skip had been a United States Army Air Forces air gunner during World War II, then enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve after the war, when he was called back into active service during the Korean War. The G.G. represented the initials of his wife, Gloria Gautraud, whom he married in 1949, with initials used so the sex of the author would remain vague. Though Gloria said that most of the writing was done by Forrest, Forrest said Gloria's ideas were used to make a plausible female character, with Gloria also providing Honey's dress sense. Forrest told the Los Angeles Times, ‚ÄúI first thought of Marilyn Monroe, and then I thought of [fictional detective] Mike Hammer and decided to put the two together ... We thought the most used name for someone you really like is Honey. And she lives in the West, so there was her name.‚Äù West was one of the first female ‚Äúprivate eyes‚Äù to ever appear on television. Francis first played West in the second-season episode of Burke‚Äôs Law, entitled ‚ÄúWho Killed the Jackpot?‚Äù, broadcast on April 21, 1965, which led to this series being commissioned as a spin-off. West drove a Jaguar convertible in the Burke's Law episode and was twice referred to as the \\"private eyeful.\\" She carried a gun and was trained in martial arts. Honey West was intended to be the American equivalent of the popular characters Cathy Gale and Emma Peel in the British series The Avengers. Producer Aaron Spelling's first choice for the role of Honey was Honor Blackman, whom he had seen in England playing Cathy Gale on The Avengers and as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger. Blackman turned the role down. Anne Francis‚Äô fashions in the Honey role were by Nolan Miller, and her action scenes choreographed by Gene LeBell. The series was developed for television by Gwen Bagni and Paul Dubov, writers of several Burke's Law episodes.  Synopsis  Francis as Honey West with Bruce. As in the Burke's Law episode introducing her, West has a partner and man-Friday, Sam Bolt (John Ericson), who communicates with Honey via a radio hidden in her lipstick case. In the television series, she keeps a pet ocelot named Bruce. (In ‚ÄúThe Fun-Fun Killer‚Äù, which originally aired on March 4, 1966, the African series Daktari is showing on Honey's TV, and Honey asks, ‚ÄúOh Bruce, why do we always have to watch your show?‚Äù) Honey's alluring feline qualities were reflected in her animal-print wardrobe and apartment decor. For sneaking around at night and engaging in energetic fight scenes, she wears a black fabric bodystocking reminiscent of Emma Peel's leather jumpsuit. Like Peel's Lotus Elan sports car, Honey's similar-looking AC Cobra convertible emphasized her independence and vitality. Although the racy content of the novels was excised for television, West often went on solo undercover missions that required a provocative or revealing outfit. She uses a number of James Bond-like gimmicks: a high-tech surveillance van, an exploding compact, a garter-belt gas mask, and tear-gas earrings. West is a black-belt in judo, as is Sam, who is an ex-Marine. Some episodes of this series, including the final one, were scripted by Richard Levinson and William Link, who would later be affiliated with such noted series as Columbo and Murder, She Wrote.  Cast  * Anne Francis as Honey West * John Ericson as Sam Bolt * Irene Hervey as Aunt Meg = Guest stars = Among those appearing during the series' 30-episode run were Joe Don Baker, James Best, Lloyd Bochner, Edd Byrnes, Dick Clark, Charlene Holt, Nancy Kovack, Kevin McCarthy, Maureen McCormick, Bert Parks, Michael J. Pollard, Wayne Rogers, Everett Sloane and Bobby Sherman. Episodes Reception Honey West was cancelled after just one season. This came down to two factors: competition from Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., and the network reportedly decided it would be cheaper to import The Avengers and run it in the same time-slot than to keep producing Honey West. Nonetheless, Francis received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Best Actress Emmy for her performance. The series was rerun in the late 1990s as part of TV Land's inaugural lineup.  Home media  In 2006, Delta Home Entertainment released the entire series on Region 0 DVD in the UK. VCI Entertainment issued a North American Region 1 DVD release of the series in September 2008.

The tsunami crossed the Pacific Ocean and damaged the harbor at Crescent City, California. Post-tsunami surveys indicate that the local tsunami in the central Kuril Islands reached runup of or more.MacInnes, B.T., Bourgeois, J., Pinegina, T.K., Kravchunovskays, E., 2009.

This earthquake is considered a doublet of the 2007 Kuril Islands earthquake that hit the same area on January 13, 2007.. Tsunami At about 11:45 UTC, tsunami warnings were issued in Japan for the north coasts of Hokkaid≈ç and Honsh≈´, and a number of towns in this area were very quickly evacuated. Tsunami warnings, advisories and watches were also issued for the coastal areas of Alaska, Hawaii, parts of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California.

In August 2020, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and racketeering.  Lucchese crime family  = Rise to power = Crea was inducted into the Lucchese crime family sometime in the 1980s, under the reign of boss Anthony Corallo. By 1990, family boss Victor Amuso appointed Crea capo, taking over Samuel \\"Sammy Bones\\" Castaldi's crew in the Bronx. Crea specialized in labor rackets, and gained power over Carpenter's Local 608, using it to extort New York City contractors. Crea also held a no-show job at Inner City Drywall, one of the city's largest drywall contractors and was involved with Local 282 of the Cement and Concrete Workers Union. In 1993, with Amuso and Anthony Casso's support, Crea became underboss of the Lucchese family. Using his new clout, Crea shifted the family's power center away from the Brooklyn crews and back to the Manhattan and Bronx crews which had historically controlled the family for decades. In the early 1990s, several Amuso/Casso loyalists, including George Zappola and Frank \\"Spaghetti Man\\" Gioia, Jr. hatched a plot to kill Crea, and take over the family. They planned to lure Crea to a sitdown and then murder him. However, the plot fell through after Zapolla, Gioia, and the rest of Amuso/Casso regime were indicted and imprisoned. = Construction boss = From 1997 through 1999, Crea served as the head of the \\"Lucchese Construction Group\\", which also included Lucchese capos Dominic Truscello, head of the Prince Street crew, and Joseph Tangorra, head of a Brooklyn crew. The Construction Group brokered the bribes and \\"mob tax\\" payments to be received from contractors, and settled disputes over who would dominate a particular construction site. Also, the mobsters were placed on the company payroll so they could report legitimate taxable income to the U.S Internal Revenue Service (IRS). During its existence, the Construction Group controlled over $40 million in construction contracts, increasing overall construction costs by 5%. In 1998, after acting Lucchese boss Joseph DeFede was indicted on labor racketeering and extortion charges, Crea became the family's new acting boss. In December 1999, Crea and Joseph Datello talked about bribery and extortion with Sean Richard, the son-in-law of John Riggi, the boss of the DeCavalcante crime family. It was later revealed that Richard was wearing a hidden recording device. In 1999, it was revealed that Crea had formed an alliance with members of the Gambino crime family in extorting local officials of New York City's carpenters, laborers and bricklayers unions. = Guilty plea on corruption charges = On September 6, 2000, Crea and other members of the Lucchese Construction Group were indicted in New York on state enterprise corruption, labor racketeering, extortion, and bid-rigging charges.The Indictment (September 6, 2000) Union Plain Facts The District Attorney charged that these schemes had systematically siphoned off millions of dollars from both public and private construction projects. Specifically, Crea used mob associates to extort building contractors who wished to receive rights to no- bid jobs or who wanted to reduce the number of union members on their payrolls. Crea's attorney was able to negotiate a favorable plea agreement which called for Crea to plead guilty to enterprise corruption and restraint of trade charges, and in January 2004 he received a 34-month prison sentence. Crea also pleaded guilty to similar federal charges and served both sentences concurrently. = Back to power = On August 24, 2006, Crea was released from prison with parole restrictions that prohibited him from associating with other mobsters or union officials.\\"With the Boss Behind Bars a Borough Battle Brews\\" Jerry Capeci New York Sun January 25, 2007 On November 17, 2009, Crea's parole restrictions expired. Since his release it was speculated that he would take over the Lucchese crime family when his parole was up. In March 2010, the FBI observed at a Bronx social club Crea meeting with capo John Castellucci. In July 2014, Jerry Capeci reported that Vic Amuso remains the official boss while Crea serves as acting boss. When the US attorneys office in Manhattan arrested him in 2017, they alleged he was the underboss of the family. =Racketeering indictment and life sentence= On May 31, 2017, Crea was indicted and held without bail for racketeering, fraud and murder conspiracy. The indictment built on charges previously filed against a reputed Lucchese soldier and associate in February 2017 with the murder of Michael Meldish in the Bronx on November 15, 2013; Matthew Madonna, Crea and Crea Jr., were charged and suspected of serving as co-conspirators in the Meldish gangland execution. Crea is also accused of ordering the attempted murder of a Bonanno crime family associate. The FBI also accuses Crea of giving his approval for one of his underlings driving to New Hampshire in an attempt to find and murder an informant. Crea was personally charged with mail and wire fraud in connection of his skimming involvement with the construction of a New York City hospital. On November 15, 2019, Crea, Madonna, Christopher Londonio and Terrence Caldwell were convicted in White Plains federal court of executing the murder of East Harlem Purple Gang leader Michael Meldish. On August 27, 2020, Crea was sentenced to life in prison, along with a $400,000 fine and the forfeit of $1 million.  References   Further reading  *Goldstock, Ronald, Martin Marcus and II Thacher.

Controversies Bulgarian news sources Sega and FOCUS linked Bulgartabac to reports that CorpBank banker Tsvetan Vasilev had ordered the assassination of Member of Parliament Delyan Peevski, prompting Bulgartabac to \\"declare war on CorpBank\\" and divest itself of all accounts within that institution. A 2014 study on Transnational Tobacco Companies (TTCs) penetration of the Bulgarian market after the fall of communism and during that nations accession into the EU concluded that Bulgartabac was involved with smuggling its own cigarettes out of, and back into, Bulgaria to avoid taxation. Bulgartabac has been linked by Turkish Customs officials to a significant role in the production and illegal import of \\"cheap whites\\" - substandard cigarettes smuggled in through Iran and Syria to avoid taxation or safety quality standards. Allegedly \\"They are shipped through the Suez Canal and Red Sea, around the Gulf of Aden and up to Jebel Ali, the transit point. Once there, the tobacco is usually disguised as another product and given fresh paperwork before being shipped onwards to Iraq, where it is smuggled back across the border into Turkey without paying excise duty.\\" Despite proximate location to their production facility, Bulgartabac publicly denied involvement with a 1.6 million dollar shipment of contraband cigarettes seized by Bulgarian customs authorities at the Port of Varna in 2010. An investigation into Bulgartabac's alleged role the incident, led by Bulgarian Finance Minister Simeon Dyankov, concluded that the cigarette manufacturer was not responsible but raised the concern that Bulgartabac did not have risk management systems in place to responsibly combat illicit traffic. Recently, the Turkish Anti-Smuggling and Organized Crime Department (KOM) sent a report to Interpol complaining against cigarette smuggling by Bulgartabac and financing terrorism. While the ownership structure of the company is unclear, Bulgarian journalists claim its beneficial owner is Bulgarian media tycoon Delyan Peevski. Social activists argue that Bulgaria's General Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov avoids investigating Bulgartabac's smuggling on purpose. Former Bulgarian Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov has drawn attention to the fact that the problem of cigarette smuggling by Bulgartabac is mentioned in every yearly report by the Turkish Anti-Smuggling and Organized Crime Department and that it is peculiar that Bulgarian authorities have not noticed.

The site contains extensive remains of a Slavic-Varangian settlement that flourished in the 10th century as a major trade station on the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. Site The archaeological site comprises a \\"citadel\\" (gorodishche) (), formerly situated at the confluence of the Rivers Dnieper and Svinets, and a ring of ancient rural settlements (selitba) which occupy an area of 17.5 hectares, of which roughly had been excavated by the end of the 20th century. This makes the site one of the largest survivals of the Viking Age in Europe: only Hedeby covered a larger territory (24 hectares), with the sites of Birka (13 hectares), Dublin (12 hectares), Ribe (10 hectares), and Gda≈Ñsk (1 hectare) trailing behind.The New Cambridge Medieval History. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Page 90. There are about 3,000 burial mounds arranged in eight clusters of kurgans. Of these, about 1,300 mounds have been explored by Russian and Soviet archaeologists, starting in 1874. There is some disagreement among scholars as to which ethnic element predominated at Gnyozdovo.

Saint Petersburg, 1902. Finds Seven hoards of Byzantine and Arabic coins (more than 1,100 of the latter) and a Byzantine dish bearing an image of Simargl have shown that the local community carried on a prosperous trade along the Dnieper. The metal objects represented include hauberks (not typical for Scandinavian sites), helmets, battle-axes, Carolingian swords, and arrows. Among the more surprising discoveries were an early folding razor with a copper handle and a pivoted scissors, probably the earliest found in Eastern Europe. The most unexpected discovery at Gnyozdovo was a Kerch amphora with the earliest inscription attested in the Old East Slavic. The excavator has inferred that the word –≥–æ—Ä—É—à–Ω–∞ (goru≈°na), inscribed on the pot in Cyrillic letters, designates mustard that was kept there.The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia, 2nd ed.

Waugh, Stephen Rudy. Contributions to Comparative Mythology. Walter de Gruyter, 1985. Page 333. The dating of the inscription to the mid-10th century suggests a hitherto unsuspected popularity of the Cyrillic script in pre-Christian Rus.

This fact highlights a great importance attached to the Dvina trade route by the Vikings. Gnyozdovo is situated downstream from the Dvina-Dnieper portages, at a point where the Svinets and several small waterways empty into the Dnieper. Like Smolensk at a later period, Gnyozdovo flourished through trade along the Dnieper going south to Constantinople and north over portages to the Dvina and the Lovat, two rivers flowing to the Baltic Sea. At the time of its establishment, the local citadel served a defensive function against possible attacks on the portages, where the Norse traders would be at their most vulnerable.–ë—É–ª–∫–∏–Ω –í.–ê. –ì–Ω–µ–∑–¥–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ–≥–∏–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫ –∏ –∫—É—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –°–º–æ–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ü–æ–¥–Ω–µ–ø—Ä–æ–≤—å—è.

After internal tensions within Kievan Rus settled down, the site of Gnyozdovo \\"formed the critical exchange centre and refitting base on the route from the Baltic to the Black Sea\\".A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures (ed. by Mogens Herman Hansen). Kgl. Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, 2000. Page 265. The settlement declined in the early years of the 11th century, simultaneously with other Varangian trade stations in Eastern Europe. By the end of the century, Gnyozdovo's importance as a trade centre had been completely supplanted by nearby Smolensk. Gnyozdovo and Smolensk Scholars are not in agreement as to how Gnyozdovo is related to Smolensk (Norse: Smaleskja), situated at the confluence of the Dnieper and the Smolnya Rivers. According to one point of view, Gnyozdovo was the functional and economic predecessor of modern Smolensk. Soviet archaeologists established that the earliest settlement on the site of Smolensk goes back to the early 11th century.–ê–≤–¥—É—Å–∏–Ω –î.–ò. –ö –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—É –æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –°–º–æ–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –∏ –µ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Ç–æ–ø–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∏. // –°–º–æ–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫—É 1100 –ª–µ—Ç.

Moscow-Leningrad, 1979. Pages 100-112. According to this version, Gnyozdovo was a pogost of the ruling Kievan monarch which he used to levy tribute from the Krivichs. Since the knyaz's druzhina was composed primarily of the Norsemen, a substantial Varangian presence at Gnyozdovo seems to be well motivated. Concurrently, Smolensk was an urban centre of the Slavic (Krivich) population, where the regional veche was held. After Vladimir the Great established a local principality for his son, the administrative centre of the region and the seat of princely power was moved from Gnyozdovo to Smyadyn Castle near Smolensk. The dichotomy of a Slavic veche centre and a Varangian druzhina station has parallels in other areas of Rus: compare Novgorod and Holmsgard, Chernigov and Shestovitsa, Rostov and Sarskoye Gorodishche, Yaroslavl and Timeryovo. In later centuries, the ruling princes from the House of Rurik preferred to settle in a fortified castle at a distance from their capital: in Vyshhorod rather than Kiev, in Smyadyn rather than Smolensk, in Kideksha rather than Suzdal, in Bogolyubovo rather than Vladimir. Nomenclature The place-name Gnyozdovo seems to be a late medieval derivation from the Slavic word for \\"nest\\". It is first recorded in the 17th- century documents. Historians disagree as to what was the earlier name of the settlement. Those who view Gnyozdovo as the antecedent of Smolensk, believe that the name of Smolensk originally applied to Gnyozdovo. According to them, Constantine VII referred to the site of Gnyozdovo when he mentioned the fortress of Smolensk in De Administrando Imperio. The Primary Chronicle records Smolensk even earlier, in connection with Askold and Dir's raid against Kiev in 867. Vasmer and other etymologists derive the name of Smolensk from the Smolnya River. If so, the original Slavic name for Gnyozdovo must have been different. Tatiana Jackson theorizes that it may have been derived from the name of the Svinets River, reconstructing it as Svinechsk (–°–≤–∏–Ω–µ—á–µ—Å–∫—ä).

Etymology The surname Keats is believed to have originated with the Anglo Saxon culture, perhaps from the old English word cyta or cyte, a worker at the shed, or an outhouse for animals, hence herdsman. It can also be attributed to the Middle English word kete or kyte (the bird) from greed or rapacity. The family name Keats emerged as a notable family name in the county of Devonshire, where they were recorded as a family of great antiquity seated at Kitts, and they were the lords of the manor and of now extinct baronets. They also branched into Berkshire and Gloucestershire. The Keats coat of arms is a silver shield overlaid with three dark silver mountain cats beneath an Armet and embroidered with vines and leaves of alternating colours of red and silver. As of the 1891 census in England, most Keats's or Keates's were resident in Staffordshire. Members of the family name Keats made their way to the New World, settling in such places as Newfoundland, Maryland, Boston, Philadelphia, and Anchorage. People with the surname Notable individuals bearing the surname include: * Abigail Keats (born 1986), South African fashion designer * Duke Keats (1895-1972), Canadian Hall-of-Fame ice hockey player * Ed Keats (born 1915), United States Navy rear admiral * Ele Keats (born 1973), American actress * George Keats (1797-1841), British-born American businessman and civic leader, brother of John Keats * John Keats (1795-1821), English poet * John Keats (writer) (1921-2000), American magazine writer, author and biographer * Jonathon Keats (born 1971), American conceptual artist and experimental philosopher * Jonathan Keates, English writer, biographer and novelist * Richard Goodwin Keats (1757-1834), British Royal Navy admiral and Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland * Roger A.

The depth of the sulcus (Latin for groove) is bounded by two entities: apically by the gingival fibers of the connective tissue attachment and coronally by the free gingival margin. A healthy sulcular depth is three millimeters or less, which is readily self-cleansable with a properly used toothbrush or the supplemental use of other oral hygiene aids.  Anatomy  Enamel 2) Dentin 3) Junctional epithelium 4) Connective tissue 5) Alveolar bone 6) Gingival margin 7) Sulcular epithelium 8) Gingival epithelium 9) Cementum The Dentogingival tissues consist of many constituents, such as the enamel or cementum of the tooth and the connective tissue supporting epithelia like the junctional epithelium, the gingival epithelium and the sulcular epithelium. The junctional epithelium is developed during the eruption of teeth when the reduced enamel epithelium merges with the oral epithelium The reduced enamel epithelium forms the first junctional epithelium and is firmly attached to the enamel. In certain cases where gingival recession has occurred, the junctional epithelium will attach to the cementum instead. The non-keratinised stratified squamous sulcular epithelium is thicker than the junctional epithelium and is attached coronally to the junctional epithelium but is not attached to the surface of teeth. Gingival Sulcus, also known as Gingival Crevice, refers to the space between the tooth surface and the sulcular epithelium. At the free gingival margin, the sulcular epithelium is continuous with the gingival epithelium. Both the attached gingivae and the free gingivae are included as part of the gingival epithelium. While the junctional epithelium is a stratified and thin epithelium that is attached to the tooth surface, the epithelium of the gingival sulcus is stratified squamous and thicker non-keratinised. Presence of Rete Pegs which may be prominent epithelial ridges can also be found in the gingival epithelium that is a stratified squamous, thick and para-keratinised epithelium.  Basic periodontal examination (BPE)  The Basic Periodontal Examination (BPE) is a quick and straightforward method to systematically screen the gingival and periodontal health of patient and determine the next stages of management in terms of further assessment or treatment that a patient might be required. = Recording of examination = 1) The patient's dentition is divided into six sextants ‚Äì three sextants for the mandible and maxillary respectively. All teeth, except the 3rd molars, are examined (note the 3rd molars are included if there are no other molars in that sextant). The sextants include: a. Upper Right (17 to 14) b. Upper Anterior (13 to 23) c. Upper Left (24 to 27) d. Lower Right (47 to 44) e. Lower Anterior (43 to 33) f. Lower Left (34 to 37) For a sextant to be recorded, at least two teeth must be present. Otherwise, the lone standing tooth will be included with the recordings of the adjacent sextant. 315x315px 2) A World Health Organization (WHO) Probe should be used. Refer to attached picture for WHO Probe. The World Health Organization (WHO) Probe has a ball ended tip which is 0.5mm in diameter and some have 2 black bands for dental professionals to measure periodontal pocket depth. A light force equivalent to the weight of the probe should be used. World Health Organization (WHO) Probe ranges in mass from 20-25 grams. 3) The probe should be run around the gingival pockets and the highest score derived in each sextant derived should be recorded. 4) Scoring codes range from 0 to 4. This can be accessed based on the flow table attached. A ‚Äú*‚Äù is recorded when a furcation is involved. 5) For patients with BPE scores of codes 3 and 4, more detailed charting is required. The presence of code 3 would indicate that a 6-point pocket charting in the sextant(s) where code 3 was recorded is required. If code 4 is recorded, a 6-point pocket charting throughout the entire dentition would be required. Usually, radiographs would be taken to evaluate alveolar bone levels for teeth or sextants where BPE codes 3 or 4 are found assuming no false pockets. = Timing of examination = Basic Periodontal Examination (BPE) should be recorded for:Picture of Flow Table for Scoring Codes ‚óè All new patients ‚óè Patients with code 0, 1 and 2 at least once annually = Guidance on interpretation of BPE scores = A myriad of factors, which are patient specific, can affect the BPE scores derived. Hence, dental professionals should use their expertise, knowledge and experience to form a reasonable decision when interpreting BPE scores. The BPE scores should be taken into account alongside other factors when being interpreted. A general guideline is: # Score 0: There is no need for periodontal treatment. # Score 1: Provide patient with Oral hygiene instruction (OHI). # Score 2: Provide patient with Oral hygiene instruction (OHI) and remove plaque retentive factors, including all supra- and subgingival calculus and any restoration overhangs. # Score 3: Provide patient with Oral hygiene instruction (OHI) and root surface debridement (RSD). # Score 4: Provide patient with Oral hygiene instruction (OHI) and root surface debridement (RSD). In addition, patient should be evaluated for the requirement of more complex treatment. A referral to specialists may be needed.  Physiological immune surveillance  After supra-gingival oral hygiene cleaning, plaque biofilm will quickly develop at the gingival margin and will enter the gingival sulcus after some time. The junctional epithelium, which is at the base of the gingival sulcus, permits plaque bacteria and its toxin to enter the underlying gingival connective tissue via the large spaces between epithelial cells of the junctional epithelium. As a result, inflammation occurs. In clinical gingival health, homeostasis occurs because resident biofilm of plaque bacteria and the host defences (symbiosis) results in a dynamic equilibrium with oral hygiene practices such as brushing and flossing. Therefore, despite having clinical gingival health, a low level of inflammatory infiltrate, consisting of neutrophils, B Cell Lymphocytes and macrophages, is always present in the connective tissue underlying the junctional epithelium. Essentially, this means that histologically, there will always be an inflammatory reaction to bacteria from plaque. The constant low-level inflammatory reaction in the connective tissue underlying the junctional epithelium also results in the formation of the Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF). The Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) is a serum like fluid that is formed from the post capillary venules of the Dentogingival Plexus which is a dense network of blood vessels within the gingival connective tissue that is sub-adjacent to the junctional epithelium. The Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) is made up of various components of cells and blood. These include defence cells and proteins such as Neutrophils, Antibodies and Complement, and various plasma protein. With the outflow of the Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) into the gingival sulcus, at a rate of approximately 0.2ul per hour, that significantly increases with the presence of periodontal disease, this produces a ‚Äúwashing effect‚Äù that aids in preventing bacterial invasion. Picture of Gingival Sulcus Legend: # Tooth Dentine # Tooth Enamel # Infiltrated Connective Tissue (is this the pink dots ‚Äì surely they should be under the junctional epihelium rather than at the gingival crest # Gingival Sulcus # Microbial Colonization # Dental Plaque and Biofilm # Junctional epithelium: Base of Gingival Sulcus  Microbiology  The environment of the gingival sulcus is unlike any other location within the mouth. The ecosystem of the gingival sulcus is more anaerobic, and the site is filled with Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF). In the presence of periodontal disease, the gingival sulcus becomes a periodontal pocket and the oxidation reduction potential will decrease to low levels as the site is very anaerobic. At the same time, the gingival crevicular fluid would have increased by 147% when gingivitis is present and would have increased by up to 30-fold where periodontitis is present. While gingival crevicular fluid provides for the cellular defence and humoral factors to combat against the microbial insult, the gingival crevicular fluid also deliver novel substrates, in the form of proteins and glycoproteins, for bacterial metabolism. These include haeme containing molecules and iron, such as haemoglobin and transferrin. Dissimilarly to dental caries, many bacteria associated to periodontal disease cannot metabolise carbohydrates for energy (they are asaccharolytic) and are proteolytic too. One effect of proteolysis is that the pH of the gingival pocket with periodontal disease will increase and becomes slightly alkaline at around a pH level of 7.4 ‚Äì 7.8 as compared to relatively neutral pH values, around a pH level of 6.9, when the gingival is healthy. In alkaline growth conditions, the enzyme activity and growth activity of periodontal pathogens, like Porphyromonas Gingivalis. Similarly, during inflammation, slight increase in temperature of the periodontal pocket will occur too. The changes in the ecology of the gingival sulcus impacts gene expression and changes the competitiveness of periodontal pathogens like Porphyromonas Gingivalis. Hence, the growth of proteolytic and Gram-Negative Anaerobes (most of the time) will be favoured by fluctuating homeostasis, the natural balance, of the subgingival microflora. Extra attention must be given to maintain the feasibility of the obligately anaerobic species when trying to find out the microflora of a periodontal pocket or gingival sulcus during the sample collection, dispersing, diluting and cultivation phase of the sample. In a perfect scenario, the sample should be taken as close to the expanding front of the lesion as possible to exclude any organisms which are not involved in tissue destruction and to achieve a clear connection between the disease activity and specific bacteria. The sample should also be taken from the base of the periodontal pocket. Most of the time, it is challenging to determine periodontal diseases accurately because not all studies are comparing pathological conditions which are undistinguishable.  Pathology  When the sulcular depth is chronically in excess of three millimeters, regular home care may be insufficient to properly cleanse the full depth of the sulcus, allowing food debris and microbes to accumulate, forming dental biofilm. This poses a danger to the periodontal ligament (PDL) fibers that attach the gingiva to the tooth. If accumulated microbes remain undisturbed in a sulcus for an extended period of time, they will penetrate and ultimately destroy the delicate soft tissue and periodontal attachment fibers. If left untreated, this process may lead to a deepening of the sulcus, recession, destruction of the periodontium, including the bony tooth socket, tooth mobility, and tooth loss. A periodontal pocket is a dental term indicating the presence of an abnormally deepened gingival sulcus.

It was directed by James W. Horne, produced by Hal Roach and distributed by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer.  Synopsis  On a snowy winter's night, Laurel and Hardy try to keep their pet dog 'Laughing Gravy' hidden from their landlord, mostly without success. The landlord eventually orders them to leave, but fate takes a hand. Stan and Ollie are in bed, when Stan‚Äôs hiccups wake up Ollie. Oliver, after suffering in silence for a few moments, wakes up Stan. Stan, in a very clownish way, drinks a glass of water and tries to go back to sleep, only to wake up the dog, whose barking rouses their landlord. The landlord throws the dog out, and Stan decides that he‚Äôs going to rescue his dog. Ollie insists on doing it, however, since Stan will wake up the landlord. Ollie succeeds in finding Laughing Gravy, only to be locked out of the building. This basic scenario is repeated several times, resulting in Ollie falling into a frozen barrel of rainwater, locking himself out of the apartment window, climbing down (and destroying) the brick chimney, etc. Eventually, the boys are going to be thrown out of the apartment (after having driven their poor landlord to the point of distraction), when the movie takes a very unexpected turn. Stan receives a letter, informing him that he‚Äôs inherited his uncle's fortune on the condition that he breaks off all contact with Oliver Hardy. Stan receives a check for $1000 to seal the deal. At first, Stan doesn‚Äôt show Ollie the letter, until Oliver, in a very funny extended scene ‚Äúguilts‚Äù Stan into sharing the letter. With Oliver‚Äôs blessing, Stan prepares to leave forever. At the last moment, however, Stan tears up the letter and returns to Oliver. Puffed up, Oliver thinks that Stan gave up the money for him, but Stan tells him that he did it for his dog. The short film ends with Stan and Ollie about to be thrown out by their landlord, only to get a reprieve. The entire house has been quarantined for two months, and nobody can leave for that time. The suffering landlord, unable to take that, picks up a rifle and walks away. Stan, Ollie and the policeman hear a shot, and the sound of the landlord's body hitting on the floor. The three remove their hats and walk away; the policeman closes the door.  Cast  * Stan Laurel as Stan * Oliver Hardy as Ollie * Charlie Hall as The landlord * Harry Bernard as The Policeman  Production notes  Laughing Gravy is a remake of the Laurel and Hardy 1929 silent film Angora Love. Charlie Hall played a tenant in the original; he plays the landlord in the remake. Harry Bernard also played the policeman in Angora Love as he does here. Laughing Gravy was partially remade in 1932 as The Chimp. The eponymous dog's name is a reference to liquor, as Prohibition was still in effect in the U.S. when the film was made. = Alternative versions = Laughing Gravy has three versions. A two-reel black-and-white version lasting approximately 20 minutes, a three-reel black-and-white version lasting approximately 30 minutes, and a three-reel colourised version. There is also a \\"feature\\" version joining this film and Be Big!, by a title card stating that Laurel and Hardy were divorced by their wives for what happened and wind up in the dingy rooming house. The three-reel version was the original one, as Hal Roach had tried to switch to the three-reel format for Laurel & Hardy shorts, starting with The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case. Just after it was completed, MGM asked Roach to limit short films to two reels, and an alternative ending was shot instead. The three-reel version had already been previewed, and a work print was rediscovered in 1985. The two-reel version and the first two reels of the three-reel version are identical except that the two-reel version ends with the landlord committing suicide when, due to his residence being quarantined, he finds he is unable to evict Stanley and Ollie. In the three-reel version, Stanley receives a telegram just before they are evicted that says he is to inherit a vast fortune, but only if he leaves Ollie behind forever. = Foreign versions = Laughing Gravy was filmed in two extended foreign language versions immediately upon completion of its English incarnation. These foreign versions combined the story of the English original with that of Be Big!, another short from the same year. Les Carottiers was the extended French version; it replaced Isabelle Keith with Germaine de Neel as Mrs. Hardy and Jean De Briac in Baldwin Cooke's role of \\"Cookie.\\" The Spanish version, Los Calaveras, featured Linda Loredo as Mrs. Hardy. Laurel and Hardy delivered their French and Spanish lines phonetically from cue cards in both foreign versions. In the preceding Be Big! Anita Garvin played Mrs. Laurel in all three films; she mouthed her foreign lines phonetically, on-camera but off-mic, while a voice actress just off-camera spoke into a \\"hot\\" mic.Skretvedt, Randy (1996).

He was part of several civic groups that pushed for the creation of a state park in Warren County. Chapman State Park, opened in 1951, is adjacent to Allegheny National Forest and State Game Land 29 just off U.S. Route 6. Recreation Chapman State Park is open for year-round recreation. Chapman Lake is open for swimming, boating, and fishing. A large picnic area is near the beach and overlooks the lake. Five pavilions are available by reservation or first-come, first-served. A rustic, wooded campground is open mid-April through mid- December. Twelve miles (19 km) of trails are open to hiking. Chapman State Park is also open to hunting and fishing in the streams as well as the lake. The park stays open in the winter for cross-country skiing, snowmobiling and ice fishing. The unguard, sand beach is open from 8:00 AM until sunset daily from the Friday before Memorial Day through Labor Day, each summer. A concession is available in the beach area offering snacks, beverages, and ice cream treats. Gas powered boats are prohibited on Chapman Lake. Electric powered and non powered boats must have a current registration with any state, a launch permit from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, or a mooring or launch permit from Pennsylvania Bureau of State Parks. A concession is available adjacent to the beach for renting canoes and kayaks. Chapman lake provides a habitat for warm water and cold water fish. Fishermen may catch brook and brown trout, bluegill, sunfish, yellow perch, largemouth bass, and sucker. Chapman Lake and the West Branch Tionesta Creek above and below the lake are stocked with trout several times a year. Visitors to Chapman State Park have several choices for overnight accommodations. The rustic campground in a wooded area has 81 campsites, with two shower houses, and water hydrants. Many campsites offer 30 Amp or 50 Amp electric service. Approximately half the sites are pet friendly. Three cottages are available to rent. The cottages sleep up to five people in single and double bunks. Each cottage has wooden floors, a porch, electric heat, lights, and outlets. The cottages also have a picnic table and fire ring in the yard area. In addition to the more traditional cottagesb two Mongolian style yurts are available to rent. These round structures are mounted on a wooden platform and have a cooking stove, refrigerator, tables, chairs, countertop, electric lights, heat and outlets. Picnic tables and fire rings are in the yard area. Chapman State Park is a trailhead for an extensive network of trails in the Allegheny National Forest. All backpackers are asked to register at the park office and leave word about where they plan to hike and when they plan to return. Hikers are also encouraged to take a map and compass. Over of Chapman State Park are open to hunting. Hunters may park their vehicle in the park to gain access to the surrounding state game lands and Allegheny National Forest. Common game species are white-tailed deer, American black bear, wild turkey, eastern gray squirrel, and ruffed grouse. All hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission.

Slaatto cooperated with Kjell Lund in an architectural firm partnership for many years.  Background Nils Slaatto was born in the town of Lillehammer in Oppland, Norway. His father Oddmund Eindride Slaatto, was a functionalist architect in Oslo in the years between the two world wars. His mother, Anine Wolleb√¶k, was also an architect, graduating from the University of Technology, but never practised. During 1938-39 Nils Slaatto took carpentry at the Technical School in Oslo before he enrolled into the Norwegian Institute of Technology, Faculty of Architecture, where he graduated in 1947. The post-war period offered numerous tasks; the most demanding was the rebuilding of northern Norway, where Slaatto participated in the reconstruction of Finnmark as district architect in Vads√∏ and Tana from 1948 to 1950. Large parts of the area suffered major damage during the war because of the Germans' use of the scorched-earth tactic. Career In 1957 Nils Slaatto and Kjell Lund, a fellow graduate from the Norwegian Institute of Technology, were invited to take part in a limited competition for an extension to the Akershus County Agricultural College at Hvam. In 1958, after winning the competition, they were able to start their architectural firm Lund & Slaatto Arkitekter AS, a partnership that lasted for three decades. As youngsters, Slaatto and fellow Lillehammer native, Lund, had both wandered around Maihaugen, an open-air museum consisting of many types of old wooden farm buildings They were influenced by this Norwegian wood architecture, adapting age-old techniques to modern production demands. An example is the \\"√Öl cabin\\" in the Hallingdal Valley, designed in cooperation with Jon Haug. The architectural firm of Lund & Slaatto was awarded the Houen Foundation Award for three of their designs: St. Hallvard's Church and Monastery at Enerhauggata in Oslo, DNV GL headquarters at H√∏vik in B√¶rum and St. Magnus Catholic Church at Romeriksgata in Lillestr√∏m. Personal life In 1949 Slaatto married Margit Bleken of Trondheim, the sister of the famous Norwegian artist H√•kon Bleken. When they moved to Oslo, Slaatto started as the leader of the Farmers' Architectural Office.

The route begins at an intersection with US 9 and NY 23B in the Columbia County city of Hudson and ends at a junction with NY 2 in the Rensselaer County city of Troy. While both Hudson and Troy are located on the Hudson River, NY 66 follows a more inland routing between the two locations to serve several rural villages and hamlets, including Chatham and Sand Lake. NY 66 overlaps with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and NY 43, two regionally important east‚Äìwest highways, in Nassau and Sand Lake, respectively. The route was assigned in the mid-1920s to an alignment extending from Claverack to Nassau via Ghent. It was extended north to Troy as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and rerouted south of Ghent to serve Hudson . Originally, NY 66 directly served Averill Park via modern County Route 45 (CR 45) and part of NY 43; however, it was realigned in 1980 to bypass the hamlet to the northeast. The segment of NY 66 between Sand Lake and US 20 was part of Route 21, an unsigned legislative route, in the early 1920s. Route description = Columbia County = NY 66 proceeding north from its junction with NY 23B in the city of Hudson NY 66 begins at an intersection with US 9 and NY 23B (Green Street) in the center of the city of Hudson. Proceeding northeast along Union Turnpike, NY 66 becomes a two-lane city road through Hudson, soon leaving for the town of Greenport, where it becomes a two-lane commercial street north of the city. Retaining its northeastern direction, the route crosses over the Claverack Creek and enters the town of the same name. The route passes the Dutch Village mobile home park and several residences before reaching an intersection with County Route 18 (CR 18 or Fish and Game Road). After CR 18, NY 66 becomes primarily rural in nature. Entering the hamlet of Brick Tavern, NY 66 reaches a junction with NY 9H in the southern end of the hamlet. NY 66 continues northeast through the town of Claverack, reaching the southern terminus of CR 20 at the eastern end of Brick Tavern. Passing south of Columbia County Airport, the route passes the junction with former CR 20, crossing into the town of Ghent. Continuing northeast, NY 66 remains rural in nature, soon reaching a junction with CR 9 (Mellenville Road). NY 66 reaches the hamlet of Ghent, where it meets a junction with the southern terminus of a section of CR 21 (Church Street). Continuing out of Ghent, NY 66 crosses over an abandoned railroad grade and a junction with another section of CR 9 (Arnolds Mill Road). At CR 9, NY 66 turns north through the town of Ghent, reaching the hamlet of Buckneyville. The two-lane roadway remains rural for this portion but the road crosses into the village of Chatham, where it gains the moniker of Hudson Avenue. Crossing through a residential section of Chatham, NY 66 reaches a junction in the eastern end of the village with NY 203 (Church Street / Coleman Street). Passing the Chatham Rural Cemetery, NY 66 enters the Depot Square, where it passes Chatham's New York Central Railroad station. NY 66 at the roundabout in the northern end of the village of Chatham Passing the station, NY 66 also has a junction with the terminus of NY 295 (Railroad Street). Now known as Main Street, the route remains commercial through the northern reaches of the village, turning northwest at a roundabout with Austerlitz Street, River Street and Kinderhook Street. Continuing onto Center Street, NY 66 winds across the northern reaches of the village before crossing into the town of Chatham, where it drops the Center Street moniker. Through the town of Chatham, the route returns to its rural nature, passing a junction with a former alignment of NY 66 that dead-ends in the nearby woods. Turning northwest again, NY 66 enters the hamlet of Old Chatham, where it reaches a junction with CR 13 before crossing Kinderhook Creek. After crossing Kinderhook Creek, NY 66 reaches a junction with CR 28\\\\. Just north of the hamlet, the route turns northeast at a junction with CR 17\\\\. Winding along Kinderhook Creek, NY 66 turns northward near Spangler Road, remaining a two- lane rural roadway. Continuing northward, the route crosses under the Berkshire Thruway section of the New York State Thruway (I-90). After a junction with the eastern terminus of CR 32, NY 66 turns northeast into the hamlet of Malden Bridge, reaching a junction with Albany Turnpike, where NY 66 turns southeast and re-crosses Kinderhook Creek. After crossing Kinderhook Creek, NY 66 turns northeast and out of Malden Bridge, reaching the hamlet of Riders Mills, a rural community alongside the creek. Less than a mile north of Riders Mills, the route crosses the Rensselaer County line and leaves the town of Chatham for the town of Nassau. = Rensselaer County = NY 66 northbound at the junction with NY 43 in Denault Corners Now in the town of Nassau, NY 66 continues northeast along Kinderhook Creek, soon reaching a junction with US 20\\\\. Continuing to parallel Kinderhook Creek, US 20 and NY 66 form a concurrency through Nassau, passing several former alignments of US 20 before crossing over the creek twice. Rapidly approaching the Columbia County line once again, the routes reach the residential hamlet of Brainard, where they meet the northern terminus of CR 19, a short connector the aforementioned Columbia CR 13\\\\. Just east of this junction, NY 66 forks north off US 20 and continues north along Kinderhook Creek as it enters the village of East Nassau. In the center of East Nassau, NY 66 reaches a junction with the terminus of CR 26 (Garfield Road). Near the junction with Tsatsawassa Lake Road, NY 66 leaves Kinderhook Creek behind permanently, continuing north through the town of Nassau, past Tackawasick Lake and the Tackawasick River before reaching the hamlet of Hoag Corners, where it reaches a junction with CR 16 and CR 21 (Dunham Hollow Road). Crossing the Tackawasick River, NY 66 continues north out of Hoag Corners and past Pikes Pond. At the northern end of Pikes Pond, NY 66 reaches a junction with CR 20 (Totem Lodge Road). Just north of that junction, the route enters the hamlet of Denault Corners, where it meets with NY 43. Now concurrent, NY 43 and NY 66 continue northwest through Denault Corners as a two-lane residential street as it crosses into the town of Sand Lake. The routes run northward along the eastern shores of Crooked Lake and past a junction with CR 49 (Eastern Union Turnpike). Soon Crooked Lake gives way to Glass Lake, which is bordered with lakeside homes near NY 43 and NY 66\\\\. Just before crossing Glass Lake Road, the routes turn northwest again, crossing into the hamlet of Sand Lake, where they reach a junction with CR 42 (Taborton Road). At this junction, NY 43 forks to the west, while NY 66 continues northwest out of Sand Lake as Miller Hill Road. NY 66 northbound at the junction with NY 2 in Troy Crossing northwest through the residential section of Sand Lake on Miller Hill, NY 66 soon leaves the town of Sand Lake for the town of Poestenkill. Along this northwestern stretch, NY 66 drops the Miller Hill Road moniker, crossing a junction with NY 351 (Reichards Lake Road / Round Top Road). A short distance after NY 351, the route returns to the rural nature it once had, crossing a junction with CR 68 (Snyders Corner Road). Winding northwest past a large quarry, NY 66 reaches the western terminus of NY 355 as it enters the town of North Greenbush. Now known as Main Avenue, NY 66 crosses into the hamlet of Wynantskill. Through Wynantskill, NY 66 becomes the main two-lane west/east street through the community, passing Evergreen Cemetery and a junction with the northern terminus of NY 150 (West Sand Lake Road). Remaining a two-lane commercial street, NY 66 continues west along Main Avenue along the Wyants Kill before leaving North Greenbush for the city of Troy. Upon entering Troy, NY 66 crosses the southern terminus of CR 142 (Mountain View Avenue). Passing through the Albia section of Troy, the route runs northwest along Pawling Avenue, remaining a two-lane residential street for a distance through Troy. At the junction with Pinewoods Avenue and passing south of Ida Lake, NY 66 turns north past Mount Ida Cemetery and crosses the Poesten Kill before reaching a junction with NY 2 (Congress Street). This junction marks the northern terminus of NY 66 just south of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and southeast of downtown Troy. History When the New York State Legislature assigned Route 21, an unsigned legislative route, in 1908, it followed modern CR 15 and CR 51 between Averill Park and the village of Nassau. The route was realigned on March 1, 1921, to use what is now NY 66 between Averill Park and current US 20 instead. This leg of Route 21 was included in NY 66 when it was assigned in the mid-1920s. At the time, NY 66 began at NY 23 in Claverack and followed modern NY 217 to Mellenville (west of Philmont). Here, NY 66 turned onto what is now CR 9 and proceeded north to Ghent, where it joined its modern alignment. On its north end, NY 66 originally ended at NY 45 (now NY 43) just south of the Sand Lake town line. The remainder of modern NY 66 north to Troy was part of NY 45, which was assigned around the same time as NY 66 and utilized modern CR 45 in the vicinity of Averill Park. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the NY 45 designation was reassigned elsewhere in the state while its former routing was split up into several routes. One of these was NY 66, which was extended northward over former NY 45 to Troy. NY 66 was altered to follow Union Turnpike southwest from Ghent to Hudson, bypassing Claverack and Philmont to the west. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY 66 between NY 43 in Averill Park and then-CR 48 (Miller Hill Road) north of the hamlet was transferred from the state of New York to Rensselaer County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. One of the highways the state received in exchange was CR 48, a northerly bypass of Averill Park that began at NY 43 and NY 66 in the hamlet of Sand Lake and went northwest around Averill Park to NY 66 north of the latter hamlet. The new state highway became part of a realigned NY 66 while the route's old alignment into Averill Park became CR 45.

Shared lands are striped. The Treaty of Leipzig or Partition of Leipzig (German Leipziger Teilung) was signed on 11 November 1485 between Elector Ernest of Saxony and his younger brother Albert III, the sons of Elector Frederick II of Saxony from the House of Wettin. The agreement perpetuated the division of the Wettin lands into a Saxon and a Thuringian part, which in the long run obstructed the further development of a Central German hegemonic power in favour of Brandenburg-Prussia. History In 1423 Ernest's and Albert's grandfather, Margrave Frederick IV of Meissen had received the Saxon Electorate from the hands of the Luxembourg emperor Sigismund. The Electorate -- formerly the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg -- together with the incorporated Margraviate of Meissen and the Thuringian landgraviate formed the united Wettin lands. After the death of Frederick in 1464, his lands were ruled jointly by his two sons, until 1485, when they were partitioned between them. In the 1485 partition the elder, Ernest, as hereditary Elector of Saxony, necessarily received the Electoral lands around Wittenberg. The rest were partitioned on the \\"I'll cut, you choose\\" basis, with Ernest partitioning the lands into two sets, and Albert choosing one set for himself. Albert chose the eastern territory of the former Margraviate of Meissen, while Ernest acquired most of the Thuringian regions in the west. Ernest was said to be disappointed by this outcome, as he had hoped to rule the lands around Meissen, which had been ruled by the House of Wettin since the 12th century, rather than the newly acquired lands of southern Thuringia. Elector Ernest established the town of Wittenberg as the capital of the Saxon electorate and proclaimed himself Landgrave of Thuringia. Duke Albert III established Meissen as the centre of the Albertine Saxon duchy and deemed himself Margrave of Meissen. In the course of the Protestant Reformation the Ernestine and Albertine branches of the Wettin dynasty found themselves on opposing sides of the 1546/47 Schmalkaldic War. As an ally of victorious Emperor Charles V of Habsburg, the Albertine Duke Maurice of Saxony gained the Wittenberg territory and the electoral dignity, after his defeated Ernestine cousin Elector John Frederick I signed the Capitulation of Wittenberg. From that event, the Albertine line in the former Meissen Margraviate ruled the Electorate and later Kingdom of Saxony. The descendants of John Frederick I only retained the Thuringian territory which furthermore split into numerous Ernestine duchies. When after World War I the House of Wettin was deposed, the Albertine Saxon Kingdom was succeeded by the Free State of Saxony, while the four former Ernestine duchies formed, along with four minor states, the Free State of Thuringia following a referendum in which Saxe-Coburg (minus Gotha), however, voted to join Bavaria.

The Southwest quadrant is the smallest of Washington's four quadrants, and the Southwest Waterfront is one of only two residential neighborhoods in the quadrant; the other is Bellevue, which, being east of the Anacostia River, is frequently, if mistakenly, regarded as being in Southeast. For that reason many residents of Southwest Waterfront will simply refer to themselves as living in \\"Southwest.\\" Southwest Waterfront is bounded by Interstate 395 to the north, Washington Channel to the west, the Anacostia River to the south, and South Capitol Street to the east.https://www.swbid.org/history Politically, Southwest Waterfront lies in Ward 6. History The Thomas Law House built in 1796 Southwest Waterfront is part of Pierre L'Enfant's original city plans and includes some of the oldest buildings in the city, including the Wheat Row block of townhouses, built in 1793, the Thomas Law House, built in 1796, and Fort McNair, which was established in 1791 as \\"the U.S. Arsenal at Greenleaf Point.\\" Prior to the federal government's survey and appropriation of the District of Columbia, most of what is now Southwest Waterfront was part of a large slave plantation owned by Notley Young. After the city was established, much of the former Young plantation was purchased by a Bostonian venture capitalist named James Greenleaf, who received a discount on sixty thousand real estate lots in exchange for a promise to build ten new houses on them per year. Greenleaf, however, had not secured the financial backing he had claimed and was unable to finance the promised construction. (He declared bankruptcy in 1797.) As a result, with the exception of a few scattered buildings such as Thomas Law's (a land speculator who was able to put down pounds sterling) and workers' shanties, settlement of the Southwest Waterfront was extremely slow. Despite his crippling of the region's growth, Greenleaf's name was eventually given to the section of land along the bank of the river on which the Arsenal stood. Law himself was the other major figure in defining the early character of the Southwest Waterfront. He built its first industrial outpost, a sugar refinery, in 1797. He also initiated the construction in 1802 of the Washington City Canal, which connected Tiber Creek, at the western foot of the National Mall, with the Anacostia River--then called the \\"Eastern Branch\\"--just east of the Arsenal. The canal opened in 1815 but was too shallow and subject to unstable tides to be useful as the industrial pipeline Law had hoped for, instead filling quickly with trash and stagnant water and serving only to isolate Southwest from the rest of the city of Washington. As a result of Law's canal, the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood was known as The Island. It was further cut off from the city when railroad tracks were built along Maryland Avenue SW. It was known primarily for its brothels, its crime, and its filthy, decrepit alley slums, and was regarded as among the worst neighborhoods in Washington. After the Civil War, with the Canal covered, over the Southwest Waterfront became more organized, though it remained a neighborhood for the poorer classes of Washingtonians. The neighborhood was divided in half by Fourth Street SW--then known as 4 Street-- with Scottish, Irish, German, and eastern European immigrants to the west and Blacks to the east. Each half was centered on religious establishments: St. Dominic's Catholic Church and Temple Beth Israel on the west and Friendship Baptist Church on the east. Each half of the neighborhood was the childhood residence of a future American musical star; Al Jolson lived on 4 Street and Marvin Gaye was born in a tenement on First Street.) The Waterfront developed a thriving commercial district with grocery stores, shops, a movie theater, as well as a few large and elaborate houses--mostly owned by wealthy blacks-- but most of the neighborhood was a very poor shantytown of tenements, shacks, and even tents. The latter were frequent subjects of photographs that were published with captions like, \\"The Washington that tourists never see.\\" It was also a major traffic hub from Virginia. The Long Bridge connected horse, stagecoach and foot traffic from Alexandria, VA to Maryland Avenue SW before becoming a railway bridge during the American Civil War.An Act authorizing the erection of a bridge over the river Potomac within the District of Columbia - 10th Congress Session I - Chapter 15 - 1808.National Railway Historical Society - Washington DC Chapter - History of the Long Railroad Bridge Crossing Across the Potomac River by Robert Cohen - http://www.dcnrhs.org/learn/washington-d-c-railroad- history/history-of-the-long-bridge It was also the access point to the Capital for steamboat lines.

Company and the Norfolk & Washington Steamboat Company.Baist's real estate atlas of surveys of Washington, District of Columbia - 1903 - Volume 2 - Plate 4 Urban renewal Jewish-owned businesses that once operated in Southwest Waterfront. This was a DGS Store.https://www.jhsgw.org/exhibitions/online/momandpop/database/store.php?id=1020 In the 1950s, city planners working with the Congress decided that the entire Southwest quadrant should undergo significant urban renewal ‚Äî in this case, meaning that the city would acquire nearly all land south of the National Mall (except Bolling Air Force Base and Fort McNair), either through voluntary purchases or through the use of eminent domain; evict virtually all of its residents and businesses; destroy many of its streets, and all of its buildings and landscapes; and start again from scratch. There was some opposition to the plan, notably from the Southwest Civic Association, because of its emphasis on building luxury housing rather than supplying low and moderate income dwellings to replace the homes slated for demolition. John Ihlder, the director of the Alley Dwelling Authority, also spoke out about the plan's failure to provide enough affordable and public housing. However, the redevelopment plans, which had been crafted by architects Louis Justement and Chloethiel Woodward Smith and which included modernist buildings, ample green spaces, and plenty of parking, were popular among many city residents and officials, and their appeal eventually won out. Only a few buildings were left intact, notably the Maine Avenue Fish Market, the Wheat Row townhouses, the Thomas Law House, and the St. Dominic's and Friendship churches. The Southeast/Southwest Freeway section of Interstate 395 was constructed where F Street, SW, had once been, separating the quadrant's business district from the residential Waterfront neighborhood. The heart of the urban renewal of the Southwest Waterfront was Waterside Mall, a small shopping center/office complex mostly occupied by a Safeway grocery store and satellite offices for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The Arena Stage was built a block west of the Mall, and a number of hotels and restaurants were built on the riverfront to attract tourists. The now closed Southeastern University, a very small college that had been chartered in 1937, also established itself as an important institution in the area. and a majority were female, but there was also a significant international enrollment. The residential aspect of the project began with a large apartment complex and park called Potomac Place, located on 4th Street between G and I Streets. When Nikita Khrushchev visited Washington in 1959, he pointed out to President Dwight D. Eisenhower the extremely poor dwellings that stood on the way from Bolling Air Force Base (where Khrushchev had arrived in the city) to the downtown area; Eisenhower, in response, ordered their driver to pass by Potomac Place in order to show the Soviet Premier that the nation's capital was working to assist its poorer citizens. Present day Titanic Memorial located beside the Washington Channel in Southwest Waterfront Due to its history of urban redevelopment, most of the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood is composed of large cooperatives or condominiums, often containing both townhouses and apartment buildings. Most of the building projects are examples of Modern Architecture. The fire pit at the Wharf Constructed in 1962, River Park contains townhouses and a glass and aluminum high-rise building that architect Charles Goodman designed.(1) (2) Constructed in 1965 in a pinwheel shape with a large courtyard and with town houses in its quadrants, Tiber Island, which architects Keyes, Lethbridge and Condon designed, received the American Institute of Architects award for Multi-Family Residential design in 1966.(1) (2) Carrollsburg was completed in 1967 and developed as a companion piece to Tiber Island by the same architects. In 1968, the Titanic Memorial was moved to the Washington Channel, near Fort McNair in Southwest Waterfront.

A number of the neighborhood's apartment buildings began extensive renovations and condominium conversions. Residential and commercial developers began to take a more serious interest in Southwest with the announcement in 2004 that the city would build the new Washington Nationals baseball stadium just across South Capitol Street from Southwest. The Southwest Waterfront has been targeted as a site for the next wave of DC redevelopment. Large development projects include a mixed retail-commercial- residential development at Fourth & M Streets SW (Waterfront Station); the expansion and redesign of Arena Stage; and the redesign and overhaul of the waterfront itself, to include residences, office space, hotels, and retail establishments.(1) (2) (3) On March 19, 2014, developers PN Hoffman and Madison Marquette broke ground on a massive redevelopment of D.C.‚Äôs Southwest Waterfront into a mixed- use complex named \\"The Wharf\\".(1) (2) Stretching across 24 acres of land and more than 50 acres of water from the Municipal Fish Market to Fort McNair, The Wharf, when complete, will feature more than 3 million square feet of residential, office, hotel, retail, cultural, and public uses including waterfront parks, promenades, piers and docks. The first phase of the redevelopment project opened with a four-day series of public events during October 2017.(1) (2) In April 2017, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) approved plans for a staircase and bicycle paths through Benjamin Banneker Park to connect the Mall and L'Enfant Plaza to the Southwest Waterfront. In addition, the project would add lighting and trees to the area. The NCPC and the National Park Service intended the project to be an interim improvement that could be in place for ten years while the area awaited further redevelopment.(1) (2) (3) (4) Hoffman-Madison Waterfront and the District of Columbia government agreed to invest $4 million in the project in an effort to improve neighborhood connectivity in the area.(1) (2) Construction began on the project in September 2017 and was completed during the spring of 2018.  Notable residents  Current and former residents of Southwest D.C. include the late House Representative John Conyers and former Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey. Hubert Humphrey lived there while serving as U.S. Vice President, and Thurgood Marshall, Lewis Powell, and David Souter all had homes in Southwest during their tenures on the United States Supreme Court.

The highway, which runs from Sciotodale to Lucasville, reroutes through traffic around the cities of Portsmouth and New Boston to the east. The bypass provides better mobility within the local area for residents and has the potential to increase the economic development of the local area. In September 2013, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) recommended a public‚Äìprivate partnership (P3) to fund and build the highway. Construction began in June 2015. The highway was dedicated on December 13, 2018 with vehicle traffic beginning the next day. Route description The freeway bypasses the cities of Portsmouth and New Boston by connecting US 52 east of New Boston and west of Wheelersburg to US 23 north of Lucasville. SR 823 begins at a partial interchange with US 52 and heads north, passing through the communities of Minford, Lucasville, and Sciotodale before ending at a trumpet interchange with US 23\\\\. The freeway has three interchanges with local roads: SR 140 near the Portsmouth city limit, CR 234 (Shumway Hollow Road) adjacent to the Greater Portsmouth Regional Airport just south of Minford, and at CR 28 (Lucasville-Minford Road) in Minford. Ohio State Route 823 east of Lucasville Ohio State Route 823 north of Sciotodale History The proposal for a bypass began in the 1962 which called for the construction of a bypass designated as Ohio State Route 423 running north from Rosemount to east of Sciotoville. An engineering contract was awarded in the waning days of Governor Michael DiSalle's administration in 1963 which called for the construction of a bypass at a cost of $19.1 million. This was promptly terminated in the same year when Jim Rhodes assumed the governorship with the engineering firm citing that the bypass would not be under construction within two to three years. The proposed bypass was referred to as a part of Corridor B following the establishment of the Appalachian Development Highway System. The project languished for years as the bypass was \\"plagued with problems\\" with the state prioritizing the construction of Corridor D. It wasn't until 1998 that a $5 million environmental study was earmarked from federal transportation dollars. After three proposed routes, the hill alignment was chosen after ODOT conducted numerous studies concerning impact to the environment and local area. =Construction= The bypass was constructed in three general phases. Phase 1 connects Lucasville-Minford Road near Rases Mountain Drive to Airport Road (a newly relocated Shumway Hollow Road) adjacent to the Greater Portsmouth Regional Airport on SR 335‚Äîthis phase was scheduled to take approximately three years to complete. Phase 2 continues the freeway from the Lucasville-Minford Road interchange to US 23 just north of Lucasville. Phase 3 continues the freeway from the Shumway Hollow Road/Airport Road interchange in Minford to US 52 near Wheelersburg. The freeway did not open for traffic on completed sections but rather upon completion of the entire project in December 2018. The construction cost was initially projected to be $429 million in June 2015, had a total construction cost of $634 million when completed in December 2018. The state's share will be $1.2 billion over a 35-year period to construct and maintain the highway while servicing its debt.

It was built in the 1920s and 1930s on land purchased from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Most of the early residents were affluent Middle Eastern Christians who built elegant homes with Renaissance, Moorish and Arab architectural motifs, surrounded by trees and flowering gardens. History Villa Salameh in Talbiya After World War I, Constantine Salameh, a native of Beirut, bought land in Talbiya from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate with the idea of building a prestigious neighborhood for Middle Eastern Christians. In addition to a villa for himself, Salameh built two apartment houses on the square that was named for him. After the 1948 Palestine war many Arab residents of Talbiya including Salameh lost the right to their properties due to Israel's Absentee Property Law. Salameh sought to regain his property under a clause that distinguished between persons who left Israeli territory due to the conflict and those who were absent for other reasons, but after being convinced that the High Court would not rule in his favor for fear of creating a precedent he accepted a symbolic $700,000 in compensation for all of his multimillion-dollar properties located in Israel. Talbiya's Gan Hashoshanim (Rose Garden) dates back to the 1930s. After the establishment of the State of Israel, official Independence Day events were held at this park. Hansen Lepers Hospital, Talbiya Before the Six-Day War, many of the villas in Talbiya housed foreign consulates. The home of Constantine Salameh, which he leased to the Belgian consulate, faces a flowering square, originally Salameh Square, later renamed Wingate Square to commemorate Orde Wingate, a British officer who trained members of the Haganah in the 1930s. Marcus Street is named for Colonel David (Mickey) Marcus, an officer in the U.S. army who volunteered to be a military advisor in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Today The neighborhood's Hebrew name Komemiyut, () introduced as a hebraization after the establishment of the state, never caught on, and it is still known as Talbiya. Some of Jerusalem's important cultural institutions are located in Talbiya, among them the Jerusalem Theater, the Van Leer Institute and Beit HaNassi, the official residence of the President of Israel. =The Lands Problem= Some lands in Talbiya are owned by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. In August 2016 a group of investors, which was called \\"Nayot Komemiyut Investments\\", purchased 500 dunams from the Patriarch, while a part of it was in Talbiya. Formerly, the lands had been leased by the Jewish National Fund (JNF) and were subleased to Israeli tenants who registered their leasehold rights in the Land registration in Israel, but the revenue was not paid to the Patriarch by the JNF. It was one of the reasons of selling the lands by the Patriarch to \\"Nayot Komemiyut\\", which committed to collect the rents for the Patriarch, as it was stated in a verdict of the Jerusalem District Court. Selling the areas to a third hand aside the Patriarchate of Jerusalem and the JNF, puts the Israeli tenants, which most of them are elderly, under an economic uncertainty, while their real estate's value goes down. Tenants cannot design plans of TAMA 38 The investors are also unable to construct or widen the buildings, because the land is still hired by the JNF for several decades. The tenants requested the Israeli government to nationalize the leased lands, or at least to compensate them in real terms for their acquires, which were equal to real estate values. The Patriarchate reacted by claiming that its property rights were offended. In the beginning of 2018, Jerusalem Municipality joined the Israeli Government and refused to release the lands overwhelmingly, claiming it had to evaluate every leased estate for its betterment levy. As a result, the Christian leaders closed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to visitors during the end of February 2018.

Route description CR 97 begins at CR 85 (Montauk Highway) west of the Islip‚ÄìBrookhaven town line in Bayport just west of Blue Point. The median at this end was widened for the purpose of adding a trumpet interchange that was never built. North of Church Street, Nicolls Road becomes the limited-access highway it was originally intended to be, only to be interrupted by Greenbelt Parkway north of the interchange with NY 27\\\\. For the rest of the journey CR 97 is a limited-access highway running along the border between Holtsville and Holbrook. The road runs on two long bridges over Furrows Road (unmarked CR 90), the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road and Long Island Avenue. Access to Long Island Avenue is available from turning ramps onto Union Avenue which lead to connecting roads that run parallel to CR 97\\\\. As the road approaches the Long Island Expressway (Interstate 495 or I-495), it runs below a cloverleaf with collector/distributor roads along the expressway that were built before Nicolls Road itself, and had served as the southern terminus of Nicolls Road until 1975. The freeway portion terminates north of the CR 16 (Portion Road) interchange. From here, the road runs along the western side of the Ammerman Campus of Suffolk County Community College where it briefly curves to the northwest, then moves back north after crossing South Coleman Road before reaching the interchange with NY 25\\\\. North of NY 25, the road takes another northwest curve until it reaches Hawkins Road south of Wireless Road, and takes a much more westerly direction. In this section, Hawkins Road serves as a frontage road along the southbound lane between Pond Path Drive and Wireless Road, while Bette Ann Drive serves as an additional frontage road along the northbound lane from Mark Tree Road to the Hawkins and Wireless Road intersection. Both frontage roads are two lanes wide and are bi-directional. Only after crossing Pond Path Drive does Nicolls Road return to a north-south road before reaching NY 347, which is slated to get a cloverleaf interchange. Beyond NY 347, Nicolls Road is surrounded by suburban development of the 1960s, although very few of that development leads directly to the road. At some point, the developed area ends, and CR 97 winds through the hills of Stony Brook University with numerous underpasses mainly for pedestrians. As St. George's Golf and Country Club becomes more visible, CR 97 approaches the penultimate intersection between the northernmost driveway into Stony Brook University before descending back into suburbia and intersecting a connecting road to Lower Sheep Pasture Road. A short distance to the north is a bridge carrying the Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island Rail Road over CR 97 and the north end of Nicolls Road at a junction with NY 25A. History The road started out as two different main highways through two different colleges in Suffolk County, and was built in stages from north to south. =Origins= The oldest section of Nicolls Road was built in the early 1960s between NY 25A and the Nesconset‚ÄìPort Jefferson Highway, now known as NY 347\\\\. The railroad bridge that carries the Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island Rail Road replaced an older and narrower one over a former section of Sheep Pasture Road. Nicolls Road bisected two sections of Oxhead Road between Sycamore Avenue and Hawkins Road. In the mid-1970s,NICOLLS RD over HOSPITAL UNDRPASS (UglyBridges.com) the driveways and pedestrian underpasses around Stony Brook University were relocated in a major reconstruction project. The next oldest section of Nicolls Road was built on the ground of the former Suffolk Sanitorium, which was converted into the main campus of Suffolk County Community College. Originally, this segment only ran between South Coleman Road and Portion Road (now CR 16). However, it ended up bisecting Horse Block Road. In order to reconnect the western section of Horse Block Road back to Portion Road, two side roads were built: a north-south frontage called Leeds Boulevard and an east-west street called Horse Block Place between Leeds Boulevard and College Road. A cloverleaf interchange with Portion Road was built in 1971, and the south-to-west ramp connected to both directions on Leeds Boulevard. In the fall of 2008, the left turning lanes at Horse Block Place were eliminated to relieve traffic heading towards the college. =Merging two college roads= While connecting the two segments, local streets such as Hawkins Road were reconstructed as a frontage road between Pond Path and Wireless Road, while Bette Ann Drive was built as an additional frontage road along the northbound lane west to Mark Tree Road. At the intersection with Hawkins Road and Wireless Road, the southern terminus of the formerly proposed CR 110 (A.O. Smith Turnpike) was intended to be built with an interchange. A.O. Smith Turnpike was to replace Wireless Road, and continue north of NY 347, towards the vicinity of Port Jefferson Harbor leading to a possible bridge to Bridgeport, Connecticut. The interchange with NY 25 was originally built as a widened median intersection that was intended to be a cloverleaf with outer ramps that connected to local streets like North Hammond Road and South Coleman Road, although construction of this interchange had been put on hold for decades. Along with the merging of the Stony Brook University and Suffolk Community College sections was the 1971 extension south of Portion Road to the Long Island Expressway. The Division Street overpass was built in 1975, four years after the at-grade intersection was built. After years of financial and bureaucratic delays and rampant development, the NY 25 interchange was finally built as New York State's first single-point urban interchange in 1998.Interchange of the Week; Monday, October 6, 2003 (Empire State Roads) =South of the Long Island Expressway= The construction of Nicolls Road south of exit 62 on I-495 required an extension of Long Island Avenue to Union Avenue, which was cut off by the road and turned into on-off ramps for Long Island Avenue. Two long bridges were built over the Long Island Avenue Extension, the LIRR Main Line, and Furrows Road, which was formerly proposed to be built as part of a Central Suffolk Highway designed to reconnect the two broken ends of NY 24 between East Farmingdale and Calverton. The rest of Nicolls Road remains a limited-access highway until reaching Greenbelt Parkway, south of the interchange with CR 19 (Patchogue‚ÄìHolbrook Road). The interchange with NY 27 was originally an intersection that replaced an intersection with Sylvan Avenue, which became a dirt road north of Sunrise Highway. Like the one with NY 25, it was built as a widened median for the purpose of being upgraded into a cloverleaf interchange. In the 1980s it actually was built as a cloverleaf, but to the newly installed service roads along Sunrise Highway, which required the elimination of two nearby roadside parking areas.

Mantronix emcee  In 1984, Brooklyn native MC Tee met Kurtis Mantronik at Downtown Records in Manhattan, where MC Tee was a regular customer, and Mantronik worked as the in-store DJ. The duo soon made a demo, formed the group Mantronix, and eventually signed with Sleeping Bag Records. MC Tee co-wrote Mantronix's debut single, \\"Fresh is the Word,\\" a club hit in 1985, reaching #16 on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. \\"Fresh is the Word\\" was featured on Mantronix's debut album, Mantronix: The Album, which was released the same year. Mantronix's second album, Music Madness, was released in 1986. While MC Tee's rhyming style on the album continued in the traditional b-boy fashion of the times, Mantronik's club oriented production and mixing in Music Madness tended to attract more dance music and electro funk aficionados than hardcore, old school hip hop fans. In 1987, Mantronix signed with Capitol/EMI and released In Full Effect the following year (1988). MC Tee abruptly left Mantronix shortly after the release of In Full Effect to enlist in the United States Air Force.

It is the first, and is the only Welsh-medium secondary school in Wrexham County Borough. It is named after the seventeenth century preacher and author Morgan Llwyd. The school has been open at its present location in Cefn Road since 2000. Previously it was located on Stockwell Grove. The Headteacher is Ms. Catrin Prichard. There are seven houses or forms into which the approximately 800 pupils are divided. These are Alun, Bers, Clywedog, Dyfrdwy, Erddig, Gwenfro and Hafod. These are named after local rivers and places ‚Äì the River Alun, Bersham, River Clywedog, River Dee, Erddig and the River Gwenfro. According to the 2014 Estyn inspection report, forty per cent of pupils come from homes in which Welsh is spoken by one or both parents. History Ysgol Morgan Llwyd opened in the 1960s, as the first Welsh-medium secondary school in Wrexham. Originally on Stockwell Grove, the school became popular and its student population grew. In the 1990s a new home for the school was found ‚Äì a former site of the Cartrefle Teacher Training College on Cefn Road. The school opened on its new site in 2000, after building work to expand the facilities on the site. The school is now regarded as one of the most modern schools in Wrexham. St. Christopher's School moved to the old site on Stockwell Grove. From 2005 the school was involved in the pilot scheme of the Welsh Baccalaureate. From 2018 construction started on a new sixth form block with eight classrooms and other facilities, which due to open in 2019. Construction was by Read Construction and the estimated cost was ¬£1.5 million. Feeder schools The feeder schools for Ysgol Morgan Llwyd include: *Ysgol Plas Coch, Wrexham *Ysgol Bryn Tabor, Coedpoeth *Ysgol I.D. Hooson, Rhosllannerchrugog *Ysgol Bodhyfryd, Wrexham *Ysgol Min-Y-Ddol, Cefn Mawr *Ysgol Llanarmon, Llanarmon-yn-I√¢l *Ysgol Cynddelw, Glyn Ceiriog *Ysgol Bro Alun, Gwersyllt The majority of pupils from these schools transfer to Ysgol Morgan Llwyd. Many pupils from other schools, with either Welsh language or English language background, also attend the school. Activities and sport Year 7 pupils have the opportunity to visit Glan Llyn, an Urdd outdoor activity centre on Lake Bala. Some pupils in years 10 to Year 13 (sixth form) participate in the Duke of Edinburgh award programme. School excursions have included trips to Germany, France, the Czech Republic, America and Belgium. All pupils have the opportunity to compete in Urdd events at the National Eisteddfod and at the County Eisteddfod. The school choir has had success in the Urdd Eisteddfod and the Llangollen International Eisteddfod, and won the show choir competition in the 2014 Llangollen Eisteddfod. The annual school Eisteddfod is usually held on St. David's Day, and is open for years 7 to 10 with pupils participating in many competitions, including form choir, garage/kitchen band and whistling. In earlier years the Theatr y Ddraig drama club productions included Sweeney Todd, Grease and Blind Date. Football and netball matches are held against other schools in Wrexham. There is a Tae Kwon Do club.

Rather, the true nature and significance had not been recognized on any of the earlier fossils, and therefore no separate species' name was assigned. The discovery was made by limestone quarry miners. Neanderthal 1 consists of a skullcap, two femora, the three right arm bones, two of the left arm bones, ilium, and fragments of a scapula and ribs. The fossils were given to Johann Carl Fuhlrott, a local teacher and amateur naturalist. The first description of the remains was made by anatomist Hermann Schaaffhausen and the find was announced jointly in 1857. In 1997, the specimen was the first to yield Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA fragments. In 1999, scientists announced that recent excavations had led them to some of the sediments of the now- destroyed cave which contained fragments of Neanderthal bones including one that fit exactly to the original femur. In 2000, the fossil of a second individual from the locality, named Neanderthal 2, was identified as a Homo neanderthalensis. The Neanderthal 1 publication represents the beginning of paleoanthropology as a scientific discipline. The fossil is preserved in the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn since 1877.

Johann Carl Fuhlrott Hermann Schaaffhausen Limestone has been mined in the Neander Valley since the early 16th century. From the mid 19th century it has been carried out on an industrial scale. In August 1856 two Italian workers extended the entrance to the Kleine Feldhofer Grotte by removing the naturally sintered, and therefore rock-hard, clay layers which were embedded into the limestones of the cave. Upon removing the sediment fillings, the workers unearthed fossilized bones in a depth of which, initially unnoticed, were disposed of among mud and debris and dispersed into the valley. The bones came to the attention of the cave's owner Wilhelm Beckershoff, who assumed them to be the remains of a cave bear.

Without Fuhlrott's approval, the following notice was published on September 4, 1856 in the Elberfeld newspaper and the Barmer local Journal: > \\"In neighboring Neanderthal, a surprising discovery was made in recent days. > The removal of the limestone rocks, which certainly is a dreadful deed from > a picturesque point of view, revealed a cave, which had been filled with > mud-clay over the centuries. While clearing away this clay a human skeleton > was found, which undoubtedly would have been left unconsidered and lost if > not, thankfully, Dr. Fuhlrott of Elberfeld had secured and examined the > find. Examination of the skeleton, namely the skull, revealed the individual > belonged to the tribe of the Flat Heads, which still live in the American > West and of which several skulls have been found in recent years on the > upper Danube in Sigmaringen. Maybe the find can help to settle the issue of > whether the skeleton belonged to an early central European original > inhabitant people or simply to one of Attila's roaming horde's men.\\" This report brought the find to the attention of two Bonn professors of anatomy, Hermann Schaaffhausen and August Franz Josef Karl Mayer. They contacted Fuhlrott and asked him to send the bones. Fuhlrott personally brought them to Bonn the following winter, where Schaaffhausen had them examined. Six months later, on 2 June 1857 Schaaffhausen and Fuhlrott presented the results of their investigations to the members of the Natural History Society of the Prussian Rhineland and Westphalen. Paleo-anthropologist and primatologist Ian Tattersall describes the results as follows: > \\"Here Fuhlrott summarized the history of discovery of these fossils, which > was based on a careful survey of the workers who had excavated the finds. He > emphasized the age of the bones, which was obvious by both, the thickness of > the overlying strata [...] as well as by the strong mineralization and > dendrite formation on the surface, which were also found in the bones of the > extinct giant cave bears. The description and interpretation of the find was > Schaaffhausen's task.\\" Schaaffhausen described the unusually massive bone structure of the find in detail and particularly noted the shape of the cranium - especially the low, sloping forehead and the bony ridges above the eyes: > \\"He considered these characteristics to be natural, rather than the results > of illness or abnormal development. They reminded him of the Great Apes. > Nevertheless, this was not an ape, and if its features were not > pathological, they must be attributed to the age of the find. [...] Although > his own search for specimens that were similar to Neanderthal was > unsuccessful, he came to the conclusion that the bones belonged to a > representative of a native tribe who had inhabited Germany before the > arrival of the ancestors of modern humans.\\" Schaaffhausen published his findings in 1858 in the Archives of Anatomy, Physiology and Scientific Medicine.Hermann Schaaffhausen: Zur Kenntniss der √§ltesten Rassensch√§del. In: Archiv f√ºr Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin. 1858, S. 453‚Äì478 A year later Fuhlrott published a Treatise on Human remains from a rock grotto of the D√ºssel valley in the team sheet of the Natural History Society of the Prussian Rhineland and Westphalen.Johann Carl Fuhlrott: Menschliche √úberreste aus einer Felsengrotte des D√ºsselthals.

Band 16, 1859, S. 131‚Äì153, Volltext (PDF; 4,1 MB) In this essay he also discussed the anatomical conditions and mentioned initially reluctant (also taking into account their integration in glacial loam-drifts) that these bones probably \\"come from prehistoric times, probably from the diluvial period and therefore belong to an archetypal individual of our race.\\" Following his comments on the geology of the locality he suspected the effect that \\"these bones are ante-diluvial (before the biblical flood), forms of fossil human remains\\". Fuhlrott's and Schaaffhausen's ultimately correct interpretation of the finds was not taken seriously by scholars of their time. As Fuhlrott published his treatise in 1859 in the team sheet of the Natural History Society of the Prussian Rhineland and Westphalen, the members of the editorial commented his interpretations with the postscript that he \\"put forward views, that cannot be shared.\\" Historical background Fossil finds of 1829 Engis 2 In 1758 Carl Linnaeus published the 10th edition of his work Systema Naturae. The name Homo sapiens as a species name was introduced to the public, but without a known diagnosis and without precise description of the species- specific characteristics. In 1833 the Dutch physician and naturalist Philippe- Charles Schmerling described a fossil skull and several other bones, which were discovered in 1829 in a cave near the Belgian municipality of Engis. He deduces their age by comparing them with animal fossils and stone tools, which he found in the same strata and associated them with the Pleistocene.Philippe- Charles Schmerling: Recherches sur les ossements fossiles d√©couverts dans les cavernes de la Province de Li√®ge. P.-J. Collardin, Li√®ge 1833, S. 1‚Äì66 However, this first scientifically described Neanderthal was misunderstood by colleagues as \\"modern\\". It lacked the criteria discriminating fossil species of the genus Homo with those of Homo sapiens. Moreover, many colleagues referred to the Bible (Genesis 1), suggesting finds from such a high age could not be determined. Even Thomas Henry Huxley, a supporter of Darwin's theory of evolution, saw in the find of Engis a \\"man of low degree of civilization\\". The finding in the Neandertal he also interpreted to be within the range of variation of modern humans.Thomas Henry Huxley: On some fossil remains of man. Kapitel 3 in: Evidence as to man's place in nature. D. Appleton and Company, New York 1863 Also the 1848 discovered and relatively well-preserved skull Gibraltar 1 of the Forbes limestone Quarry in Gibraltar was recognized only decades later to be tens of thousands of years old and firmly established as to be a representative of Homo neanderthalensis. Like Huxley before them, anthropologists of the late 19th and early 20th century still tended to classify and consider the increasingly more numerous hominid fossils as representatives of early \\"races\\" of modern man. Subject of scholarly debate Thomas Henry Huxley, Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature, London, 1863 Charles Lyell The fossil of the Neanderthal was discovered in 1856, three years before the publication of Darwin's work On the Origin of Species. Yet the scientific debate over whether species are immutable or mutable had already been going on for a long time. Hermann Schaaffhausen considers in an 1853 treatise about the durability and transformation of species \\"...that species were not immortal, that they have just as the life of the individual being a beginning, a time of blooming and of demise, only in larger time intervals, and that the various life forms also vary greatly in life- span.\\"Hermann Schaaffhausen: √úber die Best√§ndigkeit und Umwandlung der Arten.

Verlag von Adolph Marcus, Bonn 1885, S. 134‚Äì164, Digitalisat Schaaffhausen, who also had emphasized the close proximity of various anatomical and physiological characteristics of man and the anthropoid apes, concludes in his summary:\\"...the immutability of species which is considered a law of nature by most researchers, has not yet been proven\\". However, Hermann Schaaffhausen was not a scientific authority in mid 19th century Germany. Here biological sciences were at that time dominated by Rudolf Virchow, \\"...the father of modern Cell biology, who, for political reasons opposed evolutionary thought. Virchow advocated socialist ideals. He fought for a society in which not the origin, but the skills of the individual should decide on his future. The theory of evolution was an elitism to him, any inherent preference for a particular 'race' was incompatible with his ideals.\\"Ian Tattersall, Neandertaler. Der Streit um unsere Ahnen, S. 77. Before Virchow had the opportunity to see the Neanderthal bones in person in 1872, he left them to Bonn anatomist and eye specialist August Franz Josef Karl Mayer, \\"a resolute supporter of the Christian belief of creation in its traditionalist form\\".Martin Kuckenberg: Lag Eden im Neandertal? Auf der Suche nach dem fr√ºhen Menschen. Econ Verlag, D√ºsseldorf 1997, S. 51, Mayer had missed the first evaluation of the fossils during winter 1856/57 due to illness: > \\"He confirmed the Neanderthaler's \\"rickety\\" changes in bone > development[...]. Mayer argued, among other things, that the thigh and > pelvic bones of the Neanderthal man were shaped like those of someone who > had spent all his life on horseback. The broken right arm of the individual > had only healed very badly and resulting permanent worry lines due to the > pain were the reason for the distinguished brow ridges.

Nevertheless, Virchow largely accepted the anatomical findings of Mayer. Virchow described the bones as a \\"remarkable individual phenomenon\\" and as \\"plausible individual formation\\", this being the reason why the characteristics of the Neandertal finds were seen as a form of pathological change in the skeleton of modern man in German-speaking countries for many years to come. William King Even the accurate assessment of geologist Charles LyellCharles Lyell: The geological evidences of the antiquity of man. John Murray, London 1863 did not change this, who as early as 1863 after a visit to Fuhlrott and the Neandertal had confirmed the antiquity of the find. Yet seen with the benefit of hindsight, the turning point towards the recognition of the find as not being pathologically had already occurred in 1863/64. In 1864 Irish geologist William King published a detailed description of the physique of the Reputed Fossil Man of the Neanderthal, in which he - largely due to the absence of other comparative possibilities - emphasized the apelike characteristics of the fossil.William King: The Reputed Fossil Man of the Neanderthal. In: Quarterly Journal of Science. Band 1, 1864, S. 88‚Äì97, hier: S. 96. At the very end of this essay, in one of his footnotes, King mentions that one year prior he had given a lecture of similar contents at the geological section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,William King: On the Neanderthal Skull, or Reasons for believing it to belong to the Clydian Period and to a species different from that represented by Man. In: British Association for the Advancement of Science, Notices and Abstracts for 1863, Part II. London, 1864, S. 81 f. yet by now he is even more convinced that the fossil, which he at that time had called \\"Homo Neanderthalensis\\", is generally distinct from man. This casual name, chosen by King for the Neandertal fossil in footnote 27 has become the official species name in accordance with the international rules for zoological nomenclature. In 1863 British paleontologist George Busk, who had Schaaffhausen's treatise translated into English in 1861, came into possession of the 1848 in the Forbes' Quarry discovered Gibraltar 1 skull. Due to its similarity to Neandertal 1 he scoffed that even Professor Mayer should find it hard to suspect \\"that a \\"rickety\\" cossack of the campaign of 1814 would have holed up in the clefts of the rock of Gibraltar\\".zitiert aus Friedemann Schrenk, Stephanie M√ºller: Die Neandertaler, S. 18‚Äì19 Final recognition of Neanderthal man as a distinct species separate from Homo sapiens only came after 1886, after two almost complete Neanderthal skeletons were found in the Spy Cave in Belgium.Ian Tattersall: Neandertaler. Der Streit um unsere Ahnen, S. 81 Anthropological analysis The 19th century discussion first focused on the question of how the anthropological findings had to be reconciled with characteristics of Homo sapiens. Already Johann Carl Fuhlrott had noticed the unusual massiveness of the bones, the highly trained bumps, ridges and ledges that supported the attachment of vigorously trained muscles.Johann Carl Fuhlrott: Menschliche √úberreste aus einer Felsengrotte des D√ºsselthals, S. 140 One of the humerus had, according to his observation a healed injury. William King also referred to the unusual thickness of the skeletal bones, agreeing with Schaaffhausen, who had also evaluated the strongly rounded shape of the ribs and thus a quite unusual thorax for a human.William King: The Reputed Fossil Man of the Neanderthal, S. 90 ff. King mainly concentrated on the construction of the preserved skull bones. He described the shape as to be \\"stretched oval\\" and about an inch longer than that of a recent British person. The width of the skull, however hardly surpassed the width of modern man. As Schaaffhausen before him, King described the forehead region as unusually flat, fleeing and \\"excessively developed\\" bone strips above the eyes. In his synopsis of characteristics, that deviated from modern humans, King wrote: > \\"In these general characters the Neanderthal skull is at once observed to be > singularly different from all others which admittedly belong to the human > species; and they undoubtedly invest it with a close resemblance to that of > a young Chimpanzee.\\" =Intravital injuries and illnesses= G√∂ttingen pathologist Michael Schultz also devoted his investigations at the beginning of the 21st century to the health of the Neanderthal holotype.Michael Schultz: Der Neandertaler aus der Kleinen Feldhofer Grotte ‚Äì Versuch einer Rekonstruktion seines Gesundheitszustandes. In: Uelsberg, G. (Hrsg.): Roots: Wurzeln der Menschheit. Katalog-Handbuch zur Ausstellung im Rheinischen Museum Bonn, Zabern-Verlag, Mainz, S. 123-132 Michael Schultz: Results of the anatomical- palaeopathological investigations on the Neanderthal skeleton from the Kleine Feldhofer Grotte (1856) including th new discoveries from 1997/2000. In: Rheinische Ausgrabungen. Band 58, S. 277‚Äì318, 2006. He diagnosed pathological muscle tendon processes in several cases, a fracture of the left arm in the area of the elbow joint with a resulting deformity of the bone. The deformity resulted in a permanent impairment, as the man of the Neanderthal could no longer utilize the arm even after the healing of the fracture. On the frontal bone is a healed bone injury that is attributed to the fall on a sharp stone. Moreover, Neanderthal 1 obviously had suffered a healed bleeding of a circulatory brain vessel, which is also attributed to an intravital (during his lifetime) traumatic event. Neanderthal 1 suffered from extensive inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Both frontal sinuses can be seen deformed, humped and covered with small vessel traces - symptoms of chronic inflammation. With advanced age he also suffered from a serious disease that had never before been determined on a Neanderthal - a metastatic, bone-eating process of still unknown cause. His age at death was determined to be 40 to 42 years. =Postmortem changes of the skeleton= In 1992, alleged cut marks on the skeletal remains were published, particularly those at the edges of the skull, which might suggest a specific burial rite.R. W. Schmitz, W. Pieper: Schnittspuren und Kratzer. Anthropogene Ver√§nderungen am Skelett des Urmenschenfundes aus dem Neandertal ‚Äì vorl√§ufige Befundaufnahme. In: Das Rheinische Landesmuseum Bonn. Band 2, 1992, S. 17-19 Given the rudimentary state of conservation of the skeleton (16 of 203 bones) the likelihood of tooth scratches caused by carnivores is also conceivable. Yet taking the superficial and non-scientific recovery of the bones into account, the question of disarticulation (dispersion of skeletal structure by predators) remains difficult to clarify. Excavations of 1997 and 2000 temporal and zygomatic bone discovered in 2000 From 1991 on the Neanderthal bones were re-analyzed by an international team of researchers. Radiocarbon dating yielded an age of 39,900 ¬± 620 years, which suggests these individuals belonged to the last populations of this human species in Europe.Gerd- Christian Weniger: Mettmann ‚Äì Fundort Neandertal. In: Heinz G√ºnter Horn (Hrsg.): Neandertaler + Co. Verlag Philipp von Zabern, Mainz am Rhein 2006, S. 187, In 1997 the research team succeeded in extracting mitochondrial DNA from the humerus of the type specimen, the first sample of a Neanderthal mtDNA ever. Results, though, were interpreted very carefully in the publication of this first analysis. Nevertheless, evidence led to the conclusion that Neanderthals were genetically distinct from anatomically modern humans. The title of the Cell journal issue read: \\"Neanderthals were not our ancestors\\". The decoding of the Neanderthal genome in 2010 relativized this statement, though (see section below). Also in 1997 excavations in the Neander Valley determined and reconstructed the exact location of the former \\"Little Feldhof Grotto\\".Ralf W. Schmitz et al.: The Neandertal type site revisited: Interdisciplinary investigations of skeletal remains from the Neander Valley, Germany. In: PNAS. Band 99, Nr. 20, 2002, S. 13342‚Äì13347, Underneath layers of residue, loam fillings and blasting rubble of the limestone quarry, a number of stone tools and a total of more than 20 Neanderthal bone fragments were discovered. No stone tools had been unearthed from the cave prior. In 2000 the excavations continued and a further 40 human teeth and bone fragments were discovered, including a piece of the temporal and the zygomatic bone, which accurately fit into the Neanderthal 1 skull. Another bone fragment could be associated precisely to the left femur. Particular attention was given to the discovery of a third humerus: two humeruses were already known since 1856. The third humerus represents the remains of a second, more delicately built individual; at least three other bone fragments are also present twice. Called Neandertal 2, the find was dated at 39 240 ¬± 670 years old, exactly as old as Neanderthal 1. Moreover, a milk tooth was recovered and attributed to an adolescent Neanderthal.Vergleiche dazu: faz.net vom 9. September 2002: Auf den Spuren des Neandertalers.

The site was turned into an archaeological garden, its installations symbolize the eventful history of the place. The park is part of the neighboring Neanderthal Museum, which exhibits a chronological outline of human evolution. Relation to modern man A 2008 study by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig suggested Neanderthals probably did not interbreed with anatomically modern humans, while the Neanderthal genome project published in 2010 and 2014 suggests that Neanderthals did contribute to the DNA of modern humans, including most non-Africans as well as a few African populations, through interbreeding, likely between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago.Brahic, Catherine. \\"Humanity's forgotten return to Africa revealed in DNA\\", The New Scientist (February 3, 2014).

The Purdue Big Bass Drum is a percussion instrument played by the All-American Marching Band of Purdue University. At a height of over ten feet (three meters) when the carriage is included, it is branded by Purdue as the \\"World's Largest Drum.\\" Since its inception, it has become a lasting symbol of the marching band as well as the university. The drum can be seen at all home football games as well as parades, alumni rallies, the Indianapolis 500 Race, and many other special events. Appearance The drum stands approximately ten feet high on its carriage. Purdue is reluctant to disclose the exact measurements of the drum. Hayleigh Colombo of the IndyStar was able to confirm the drum's original size of 7 feet 3 inches in diameter and 3 feet 9 inches wide from microfilm stored at the Tippecanoe County Public Library. Many of the original components, the carriage, axle, wheels, and wood shell of the drum are all intact and well preserved. Since its trip to Ireland with the \\"All-American\\" Marching Band in the spring of 2013, the drum has been remastered with new paint and select new parts to replace ones damaged on the trip. The carriage is built upon a Ford Model T back axle and wheelbase. The rims are steel wire spoke rims common during the 1910s in the racing circuit. The drum is handled by a crew of four chrome-helmeted bandsmen, who are selected for their strength and agility, along with two beaters. They painstakingly rehearse every movement of the \\"Monster\\" drum to assure its being in the right place at the right time in accordance with the precise timing necessary for the fast-paced shows presented by the \\"All-American\\" Band. History In 1921, Purdue Marching Band Director Spotts Emrick commissioned the Leedy Manufacturing Company in Indianapolis, Indiana, to produce a massive bass drum (cost: $911.12). Other bands were trying to make large drums at the time, but most could only achieve a diameter of about four feet. The main constraints included finding cattle skins large enough to use for drum heads, and carrying the drum both during and in between performances. After months of searching, Leedy's suppliers solved the first problem by finding steers weighing between 2,000 and 3,000 pounds each, which are said to have been from Argentina. These large heads put a great strain on the shell, requiring special reinforcement rods to be designed. While other marching bands had tried having two people work together to move their large drums along the football field, Emrick and Leedy decided to use a wheeled carriage. After contacting Jesse Lemon of the New York Central Railroad, Emrick was able to find a baggage car with a door large enough to accommodate the Monster. The Purdue Drum's first football game was at the University of Chicago, whose band members immediately contacted Conn asking for an even larger drum. The resulting instrument was completed the following year and later sold to the University of Texas at Austin where it was nicknamed \\"Big Bertha.\\" The drum was refurbished in 1937 when the natural wood finish was replaced by an old gold diamond pattern and several inches were added to the drum's size. With the arrival of World War II, the Big Bass Drum was put into storage as the materials required such as animal skin drum heads and rubber tires were not supportive of the war effort. By the time Al Wright became Purdue's director of bands in 1954, the Big Bass Drum had been neglected after years of damage in storage. Wright had the drum repaired and once again made it a centerpiece of the marching band. Because large cattle were much rarer than they were when the drum was built, Remo began making Mylar drum heads for Purdue in the early 1960s. These synthetic heads can be changed frequently. While the drum may have been the world's largest in overall size at the time it was constructed, other drums have claimed the title of world's largest, such as the Millennium Drum. However, no official comparative measurement has ever been made. In 1961, the University of Texas and Purdue University chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi, an honorary band fraternity, pledged to bring their drums to the national convention in Wichita, Kansas for a direct comparison; however, only Purdue showed up.. As of 2013, the University of Texas and University of Missouri have larger drums at 8 feet tall/44 inches wide and 9 feet tall/54 inches wide, respectively. The BBD has also gained national attention on several occasions, such as when it has been stolen, usually by students from Notre Dame or Big Ten rival, Indiana. Traditions =Spinning in the Block P= In 1907 the Purdue All- American Marching Band was the first marching band to break ranks and form a block letter on the field. During the pregame show, the drum is positioned in the 'P' formed by the marching band and spins while the band plays \\"Hail Purdue!\\". =Indianapolis 500= Being part of the official band of the Indianapolis 500, the drum can be seen on the back of a pickup truck driven around the track. =Aerials= When Purdue scores, the drum crew can occasionally be seen performing aerials in the Southeast endzone of Ross‚ÄìAde Stadium. This is accomplished by first removing the 'third' wheel, which acts as kick stand. Two crew members pull down of the back of the drum as two other members are lifted on the front bar of the carriage, while performing acrobatic stunts, such as spinning on the bar, horizontal holds, and one handed balancing. =Pushups= Drum crew members perform push-ups each time the Purdue Boilermakers score a touchdown. The push-ups correspond to the total score achieved at that point by the Purdue football team. The push-up tradition was started by Eric Stankiewicz in 1994. =Signatures= Another tradition is for celebrities to sign the drum head, and old autographed heads are kept in the Bands Department. The head was signed by US President Harry Truman in 1961. Kix Brooks of Brooks and Dunn signed his name to the drum before a concert at Purdue University in 1995. Other signatures include astronauts Gus Grissom and Neil Armstrong as well as Snoop Dogg and the Kodo Drummers of Japan. The inside of the drum is filled with names of previous drum crew members. Through two air expansion holes in the side of the drum, one can easily spot the names. =Training= Every fall during the week of camp, training occurs. The potential crew is put through a series of physical and public relations tests to determine if they suit the characteristics needed to be on the crew. Physical tests include: 2 minutes of push-ups, 2 minutes of sit-ups, a 1.5-mile road course, a 100-meter dash, and a 400-meter run. Each test has a perfect score for which members aim. A series of questions are asked to the crew to see how they would respond in certain situations because during a year many types of situations can occur ranging from talking with celebrities, rowdy fans, and senior citizens. Each takes a certain adaptation that a crew member needs to make. Questions also include history of and other important facts of the drum such as its size and original cost. Thursday of camp the crew scales the stairs of Ross‚ÄìAde Stadium for one final run in the blistering sun of an Indiana August.

It is often used to connote such a person who is habitually engaged in small-time criminal activity, especially by one working as a con artist or panhandler. History In its modern form, the use of skell as a slang term in the United States appears to date only from the 1960s, most especially from New York City. The word has sometimes been used by the police officer characters on the TV shows NYPD Blue, Third Watch, Gotham, Law and Order: SVU, and Blue Bloods. The term has been so overused on these programs that it has essentially come to mean any sort of criminal or perp, which itself has come to mean anyone accused of a crime. It also appears in the 1964 novel Last Exit to Brooklyn by American author Hubert Selby, Jr. Origin Possible origins for the word include: *The 17th century English slang word skelder, a noun and verb which referred to a professional beggar, especially one who falsely pretended to be a wounded former soldier to gain sympathy; more generally, it could be used for a swindler or cheat. An early recorded use is by Ben Jonson, from his play Poetaster, written in 1601: 'An honest decayed commander, cannot skelder, cheat, nor be seene in a bawdie house.' In an older military connection, the term skelder seems to have been used in early Medieval England to mean 'shield-maker' (Old Norse 'skjoldur'?), the supposed derivation of the streetname Skeldergate in the city of York. * The Dutch schelm, a word meaning a villain or rogue. * The Latin scelus, meaning a wicked deed or wickedness. Use in film, television and music The term is used several times in the film Miller's Crossing, especially in regard to the character Bernie Bernbaum. Crow T. Robot refers to Michael J. Nelson as a skell in a sketch performed in episode 905 of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Ed Burns (Mickey) refers to Mike McGlone (Francis) as a skell in the movie She's the One. Joe Pesci (Nicky Santoro) uses the term skell in his rant to Robert De Niro (Sam Rothstein) in the movie Casino. Police Officer Smitty refers to Bender as a skell when he and his partner, URL, are undercover in Little Bitaly in the second-season episode of Futurama entitled Bender Gets Made. Within the Law & Order television series, the term has been casually used by leading characters such as Det. Lennie Briscoe, Det. Elliot Stabler and Det. Mike Logan. In the Third Watch television series, the term has been frequently used in casual conversation between the leading NYPD characters such as John \\"Sully\\" Sullivan, Maurice \\"Bosco\\" Boscorelli and others. Starting in Season 2 (Rise of the Villains) of Gotham, Michael Chiklis (Captain Nathanial Barnes) often refers to miscellaneous but expectedly nefarious characters as \\"skells.\\" He typically does so with a \\"shoot 'em if you need to\\" tone, alluding to the worthless nature of their character, both literally and figuratively. The term is mentioned in Type O Negative song \\"Der Untermensch\\", in the line \\"Skells like you allowed to live/ Get off society's back\\". The term is used frequently in the Public Morals television series written by Ed Burns and set in 1960s New York City.https://www.wsj.com/articles/public- morals-review-bring-in-the-vice-squad-1440108418 While cleaning up after a vagrant's vomit due to hallucinations and visions, a police officer in Max Payne 2 says about aforementioned vagrant \\"I've been cleaning up after this skell all night\\". In 'True Confessions' the fourth episode of the NYPD Blue first season, Robert Breuler (Detective Walker) and his partner Dennis Franz (Detective Sipowicz) use the term several times when referring to a very nervous Ethan Phillips (Dwight). Used in the series The Deuce starring James Franco. Used in the series Better Call Saul.

The previous day, Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger had died when his car crashed during qualification for the race. His and Senna's crashes were the worst of several that took place that weekend (including a serious one involving Rubens Barrichello) and were the first fatal collisions to occur during a Formula One race meeting in twelve years (and not repeated until 20 years later at Suzuka Circuit). This became a turning point in the safety of Formula One, prompting the implementation of new safety measures in both Formula One and the circuit, as well as the Grand Prix Drivers' Association to be reestablished. The Supreme Court of Cassation of Italy ruled that mechanical failure was the cause of the crash, although this has been disputed.  Background  In 1994, Senna left his longtime team McLaren, which he had joined in 1988, to join Williams, replacing his former teammate Alain Prost and being paired with Damon Hill. Williams was expected to again contend for the F1 World Championship as they had in the previous two seasons with Prost and Nigel Mansell, albeit with cars that no longer had electronic aids, which had been banned for the 1994 season. On debut for his new team during the traditional pre-season testing at Estoril, Senna said of the Williams FW16: The problems continued as the season commenced. Senna had his worst ever start to a Formula One season, failing to finish or score points in the first two races (the Brazilian and Pacific Grands Prix), despite having taken pole in both. Benetton's Michael Schumacher was the championship leader entering the third race at Imola, with Senna trailing by 20 points. 1994 San Marino Grand Prix Rubens Barrichello (pictured at the 1995 French Grand Prix) suffered a high speed crash at the Variante Bassa chicane On the Friday before the race, Senna's proteg√©, Rubens Barrichello, driving for the Jordan team, clipped a kerb and crashed heavily at at the Variante Bassa chicane. Senna got out of his Williams car and went to the scene of the collision. Barrichello's tongue blocked his airway and emergency work done by FIA doctor Sid Watkins saved his life. Barrichello regained consciousness and found Senna looking over him. After learning Barrichello had survived, Senna returned to his car and continued his practice session. After the session concluded, he left his car and went to the Williams motor home to attend pre-arranged interviews for the press and told the attending journalists to wait one hour while he was checking car problems with his engineer, David Brown. Following the interviews, Senna continued his work with Brown for another two hours. Once he arrived back to his hotel in Castel San Pietro, Senna reportedly telephoned his girlfriend Adriane Galisteu and broke down into tears while recounting Barrichello's crash earlier that day. On Saturday morning, Senna set a personal best time of 1m 22.03 seconds and agreed with teammate Damon Hill that the car had improved. Having been released from the Medical Centre, Barrichello told Senna he was flying back to England to watch the race on television. Roland Ratzenberger was killed after colliding with a concrete wall at the Villeneuve Curve In the afternoon, the second qualifying session began and 18 minutes into the session, Simtek driver Roland Ratzenberger struck the concrete wall on the outside of the Villeneuve curve at 314 km/h, as a result of a suspected front wing failure. After the impact with a concrete barrier, the car bounced off and rested in the middle of that section of the track. Senna saw the replays of the collision and rushed into the pitlane to get inside a course car. When he arrived, with Ratzenberger taken into an ambulance, Senna inspected the damaged Simtek. He then attended the circuit's Medical Centre where he learnt from neurosurgeon Sid Watkins that Ratzenberger had died. When the two left the centre together, Watkins told Senna that he did not have to race ever again and suggested that he withdraw from the race and go fishing with him. Senna responded by telling Watkins he could not stop racing and then went back to the Williams garage, where he summoned Patrick Head and Frank Williams, telling them of the situation and deciding to withdraw for the remainder of the qualifying session. Reportedly, Senna retired to his motor home where he broke down in tears and collapsed onto the floor. This had concerned Williams, who asked Betise Assump√ß√£o, Senna's PR chief to arrange a meeting to discuss Senna's emotional state. Senna decided not to attend the post-qualifying press conference, leading the FIA to discuss but decide not to take disciplinary action against him. On the following day, however, Race Stewards called Senna out of his motor home to discuss his having commandeered a course car to visit Ratzenberger's crash site. A row ensued and Senna stormed off in disgust. The Stewards decided to take no action. On Sunday morning, Senna was the fastest in the warm-up session by nine-tenths of a second. Afterwards he saw former McLaren rival Alain Prost sitting at a table. They talked together for 30 minutes, with Senna lobbying for Prost's help to improve the sport's safety, both agreeing to meet before the Monaco Grand Prix. Next, Senna filmed an in-car lap of Imola for French television channel TF1, where he greeted Prost now working as a presenter for that channel: \\"A special hello to our dear friend Alain. We all miss you, Alain.\\" Prost said that he was amazed and very touched by the comment. At the drivers' briefing, Senna attended along with Gerhard Berger. Since he was unwilling to speak out due to the earlier row with race officials that had left him still fraught with emotions, Senna asked Berger to raise his concerns about the pace car's presence during formation lap, which had no role other than to promote the then latest Porsche 911. At the San Marino Grand Prix, this pace car was thus made to leave the grid in advance of the Formula One cars, instead of together. Senna then met with fellow drivers to discuss the re-establishment of a drivers' group (the Grand Prix Drivers' Association) in an attempt to increase safety in Formula One. As the most senior driver, Senna offered to take the role of leader, starting with the next race event in Monaco. Niki Lauda suggested that Senna lead the group because of his strong personality, relative to the other drivers.  Racing crash  A map of the circuit per layout, with the Tamburello corner encircled At the start of the race, Pedro Lamy and JJ Lehto were involved in a serious collision, spraying debris into the crowd and injuring bystanders. Track officials deployed the Opel Vectra safety car, driven by German Formula Three driver Max Angelelli, to slow down the field and allow the removal of debris. The competitors proceeded behind the safety car for five laps. As the Vectra was based on a family sedan and not relatively fast, Senna had pulled alongside the Vectra to gesture to its driver to speed up; this car was subsequently regarded as inadequate for the role (due to the fact that its brakes had overheated and thus had to be driven slowly, lest itself be the cause of a crash) and a cause of the alleged drop in tyre pressures of the following Formula One cars. Before the sixth lap, David Brown told Senna via pit-to-car radio that the safety car was pulling off, and Senna acknowledged the message. On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace with the third-quickest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher. At the flat-out left-hander Tamburello corner, Schumacher noticed that Senna took a tight line through the curve and his car jiggled on the bumps. On lap 7, the second lap at racing speed, Senna's car left the racing line at Tamburello, ran in a straight line off the track and struck an unprotected concrete barrier. Telemetry data recovered from the wreckage shows he entered the corner at and then braked hard, downshifting twice to slow down before impacting the wall at . p. 154 \\"Senna's speed was 192 m.p.h. when he entered Tamburello, and 131 m.p.h. when he hit the wall.\\" The car hit the wall at a shallow angle, tearing off the right front wheel and nose cone before spinning to a halt. After Senna's car stopped, he was initially motionless in the cockpit. After about ten seconds, as recorded by the close-up aerial footage, his head was seen to lift to the left before returning to its original position. Thereafter he did not move again. The right front wheel had shot up upon impact and entered the cockpit, striking the right frontal area of his helmet. The violence of the wheel's impact shoved his head back against the headrest (which was already far forward from the car's impact with the wall) causing fatal skull fractures. In addition, a piece of suspension attached to the wheel had also partially penetrated his Bell M3 helmet and caused trauma to his head. Also, it appeared that a jagged piece of the upright assembly had penetrated the helmet visor just above his right eye. Senna was using a medium-sized (58 cm) M3 helmet with a new \\"thin\\" Bell visor. Any one of the three injuries would probably have killed him. After the crash, it was immediately evident that Senna had suffered some form of injury, because his helmet was seen to be motionless and leaning slightly to the right. The subtle movement of his head in the seconds that followed raised false hopes. Moments after the crash, Angelo Orsi, a photographer and a friend of Senna, took photographs of Senna in the car after his helmet was removed and Senna being treated before marshals blocked his view. Despite receiving numerous offers, the photographs have only been seen by Orsi and the Senna family, who insisted that Orsi not publish the photographs. Fire marshals arrived at the car and were unable to touch Senna before qualified medical personnel arrived. Senna was pulled out of the car within minutes. Television coverage from an overhead helicopter was seen around the world, as rescue workers gave Senna medical attention. Close inspection of the area in which the medical staff treated Senna revealed a considerable amount of blood on the ground, probably from the pieces of suspension and upright assembly penetrating his helmet. From visible injuries to Senna's head, it was evident to attending medical professionals that he had sustained a grave head trauma. An emergency tracheotomy was conducted alongside the track to establish a secure airway through which the medical personnel could artificially maintain his breathing. The race was stopped one minute and nine seconds after Senna's crash. Williams team manager Ian Harrison went up to race control, finding a scene where many race officials were sensing that Senna's crash had been serious. Bernie Ecclestone later arrived in race control to calm the situation. Neurosurgeon Sid Watkins, the head of Formula One's on-track medical team, performed the on-site tracheotomy on Senna. Watkins later reported: > He looked serene. I raised his eyelids and it was clear from his pupils that > he had a massive brain injury. We lifted him from the cockpit and laid him > on the ground. As we did, he sighed and, although I am not religious, I felt > his spirit depart at that moment. Watkins cleared the respiratory passages, stemmed the blood flow, replaced lost blood and immobilised the cervical area. Watkins radioed for a medical helicopter and asked the intensive care anaesthetist, Giovanni Gordini, to escort Senna to Maggiore Hospital. During the safety car period, √ârik Comas brought his Larrousse-Ford to the pit lane to correct a vibration issue caused by contact during the yellow flag phase. Shortly after the helicopter landed on the racing surface, Comas left the pit area and attempted to rejoin the now red flagged Grand Prix due to a miscommunication with his crew. The race marshals waved frantically at Comas as he approached Tamburello, since he was apparently unaware of what was taking place, and he slammed on his brakes in time to stop the Larousse avoid a collision with the medical chopper. When he spotted Comas approaching the accident scene, John Watson -- covering the events as an analyst for EuroSport -- as the \\"most ridiculous thing I've ever seen at any time in my life\\". Senna's car was eventually lifted onto a truck and returned to the pit lane where officials impounded it. However, an unidentified person insisted that the black-box data carried on the car should be removed. At 3:00 pm, the helicopter landed in front of the Maggiore Hospital. Doctors rushed Senna into intensive care; a brain scan confirmed the diagnosis made on the track. At 3:10 pm, Senna's heart stopped beating, doctors restarted his heart, and he was placed on a life-support machine. Senna's brother Leonardo arranged for a priest to perform the last rites which occurred at 6:15 pm. Senna's heart stopped beating at 6:37 pm, and it was decided not to restart it. Doctor Maria Teresa Fiandri, the emergency department head physician at the hospital who was off-duty and had been watching the race live from home with her sons, immediately left for the hospital and arrived at the same time as Senna's helicopter landed some 28 minutes after the crash. In her interview after 20 years, she confirmed that the blood loss suffered by Senna was due to a damaged superficial temporal artery and that, apart from his head injuries, Senna appeared serene and the rest of the body was intact. Fiandri became responsible for providing medical updates to the media and public that had amassed at the hospital and, at about 7:00 pm, she announced that Senna died at 6:40 pm. It was later revealed that, as medical staff examined Senna, a furled Austrian flag was found in his car‚Äîa flag that he had intended to raise in honour of Ratzenberger after the race. Some time after the race, Ian Harrison was called by an Italian lawyer informing Harrison of Senna's death and that it was being treated as a \\"road traffic accident\\". Early in the morning of 2 May, Harrison was called by another lawyer, who took him to a mortuary. Harrison declined to see Senna's body upon being asked. Following some stability and aerodynamic issues Senna's Williams FW16 was re-engineered by Adrian Newey to provide better handling at the request of Senna and Hill.How to Build a Car - Book by Adrian Newey After the end of the season, the cars were significantly changed to be safer. At Imola, Tamburello was changed from a flat-out left-hander to a chicane and a slow left-hander. Funeral Monument to Ayrton Senna, Melinda Garcia's work, installed at the entrance of the tunnel under Ibirapuera Park, S√£o Paulo, Brazil Senna's death was considered by many of his Brazilian fans to be a national tragedy, and the Brazilian government declared three days of national mourning. Contrary to airline policy, Senna's coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home country not as cargo but in the passenger cabin of a Varig McDonnell Douglas MD-11 commercial jetliner (registration PP-VOQ (cn 48435/478)), accompanied by his younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends. Senna's coffin was covered with a large Brazilian flag. The funeral, taking place on 5 May 1994, was broadcast live on Brazilian television and an estimated three million people lined the streets of his hometown of S√£o Paulo. Many prominent motor racing figures attended Senna's state funeral, notably Alain Prost, Gerhard Berger, Jackie Stewart, Damon Hill, Thierry Boutsen, Rubens Barrichello (Ayrton's new prot√©g√©) and Emerson Fittipaldi who were among the pallbearers. Watkins and then McLaren team coordinator Jo Ram√≠rez did not attend as they were so grief-stricken. Senna's family did not allow FOM president Bernie Ecclestone to attend, and FIA president Max Mosley instead attended the funeral of Roland Ratzenberger which took place on 7 May 1994, in Salzburg, Austria. Mosley said in a press conference ten years later, \\"I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna's. I thought it was important that somebody went to his.\\" Senna was buried at the Morumbi Cemetery in S√£o Paulo. His grave bears the epitaph \\"Nada pode me separar do amor de Deus\\", which means \\"Nothing can separate me from the love of God\\". At the Tokyo headquarters of Honda, where McLaren-Honda cars were typically displayed after each race, so many floral tributes were received after Senna's death that they overwhelmed the large exhibit lobby. This was despite Senna no longer driving for a Honda-powered team. Senna had a special relationship with company founder Soichiro Honda and was revered in Japan, where he achieved a near mythic status. For the next race at Monaco, the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger. Aftermath =Reactions= ESPN, who broadcast the San Marino Grand Prix in the United States, broke the news to its audience during the NASCAR Winston Select 500 (now the GEICO 500) Winston Cup race later that afternoon from Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega, Alabama. With the race under a caution period on Lap 111, with Dale Earnhardt leading, lead commentator Bob Jenkins announced Senna had died and extended the network's condolences. To honor Senna, the ESPN booth of Jenkins, Ned Jarrett, and Benny Parsons went silent for the ensuing restart, ending after another multiple-car incident resulted in another caution flag period within two laps of the restart. In Brazil, the country's television networks spent the rest of the day interrupting their normal programming schedules to announce Senna's death and replay his last interview, given to the media on the day before the crash. Many motor racing fans gathered outside of Maggiore Hospital to pay their respects to Senna, causing major traffic jams. Fans also gathered in the Williams F1 factory in Didcot where around 200 people attended with flowers laid on the front gates of the factory. The Italian and Brazilian press were critical of the FIA for the rule changes that were enacted for 1994. Benetton driver Schumacher called for improvements in safety. BBC Sport commentator Murray Walker called Senna's death the \\"blackest day for Grand Prix racing that I can remember\\". Two and a half months later, following Brazil's victory over Italy in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the Brazilian squad dedicated their World Cup victory to Ayrton Senna. =Safety improvements= The layout of the circuit was changed after the two fatal crashes at the 1994 event On 3 May, the FIA called a meeting at the request of the Italian Automobile Club to review the events of the weekend. Later on, the governing body announced new safety measures for the next round in Monaco which included the following three changes: # Entry to and exit from the pit lane would be controlled by a curve to force cars to run at a reduced speed # No team personnel would be allowed onto the pit lane surface except those directly involved with working on a car during a scheduled pit stop # A draw would be arranged to determine the scheduled order in which cars make pit stops. Stops made out of the designated order will be limited to emergencies only and cars would not be allowed to take on fuel or new tires. On 8 May, it was reported that Federico Bendinelli, an official who worked at Imola, said Senna had inspected the Tamburello corner and declared it was \\"O.K.\\" Williams ran tests on one of their rigs attempting to replicate Senna's accident from the data retrieved. They attempted to simulate a mechanical failure which had not proven conclusive. At the next race in Monaco, retired world champion Niki Lauda announced the reformation of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA). The representatives elected were Lauda and active drivers Michael Schumacher, Gerhard Berger and Martin Brundle. At the end of the season, the GPDA demanded the FIA improve the safety of Formula One. The FIA responded quickly and introduced changes to the regulations as follows:Official 1994 season review video For the Spanish Grand Prix: * the size of diffusers would be reduced; * the front wing end plates would be raised; * the size of the front wing would be reduced. All together this would reduce the amount of downforce by about 15%. For the Canadian Grand Prix: * the lateral protection of the drivers' heads would be improved by increasing the height of the sides of the cockpit; * the minimum weight of a Formula One car would be increased by 25 kg (changed to 15 kg by Canadian GP); * the front wishbones would be strengthened to reduce the possibility of a front wheel coming loose and striking the driver; * the cockpit would be lengthened to prevent drivers striking their head on the front of the cockpit; * the use of pump petrol would be imposed; * the airboxes from the engines would be removed to reduce the airflow to the engines and thus decrease the power available. Other changes included improved crash barriers, redesigned tracks and tyre barriers, higher crash safety standards, higher sills on the driver cockpit and a limit on 3-litre engines. The FIA immediately investigated the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola, and the track's signature Tamburello turn was changed into a left-right chicane as a result. In February 1995, a 500-page report by a team of judicial investigators was handed over to Italian prosecutors which attributed Senna's crash to steering column failure caused by a pre-race adjustment. Autopsy During legal proceedings before the Italian courts on 3 March 1997, based on the expert testimony and evidence of the pathologist, Dr Cipolla, Senna's official time of death was recorded as 2:17 pm on 1 May 1994, coinciding with cerebral death under Italian law, upon Senna hitting the Tamburello wall. The FIA and Italian motorsport authorities still maintain that Senna was not killed instantly, but rather died in the hospital, where he had been rushed by helicopter after an emergency tracheotomy and IV administration were performed on the track. There is an ongoing debate as to why Senna was not declared dead at the track. Under Italian law, collisions resulting in a fatality must be investigated for any criminal culpability. The activities that cause the fatality, such as a sporting event, must be suspended forthwith and the scene of the crash secured. The former Director of the Oporto (Portugal) Legal Medicine Institute, Professor Jos√© Eduardo Pinto da Costa, has stated the following: > From the ethical viewpoint, the procedure used for Ayrton's body was wrong. > It involved dysthanasia, which means that a person has been kept alive > improperly after biological death has taken place because of brain injuries > so serious that the patient would never have been able to remain alive > without mechanical means of support. There would have been no prospect of > normal life and relationships. Whether or not Ayrton was removed from the > car while his heart was beating or whether his supply of blood had halted or > was still flowing, is irrelevant to the determination of when he died. The > autopsy showed that the crash caused multiple fractures at the base of the > cranium, crushing the forehead and rupturing the temporal artery with > haemorrhage in the respiratory passages. It is possible to resuscitate a > dead person immediately after the heart stops through cardio-respiratory > processes. The procedure is known as putting the patient on the machine. > From the medical-legal viewpoint, in Ayrton's case, there is a subtle point: > resuscitation measures were implemented. From the ethical point of view, > this might well be condemned because the measures were not intended to be of > strictly medical benefit to the patient but rather because they suited the > commercial interest of the organisation. Resuscitation did, in fact, take > place, with the tracheotomy performed, while the activity of the heart was > restored with the assistance of cardio-respiratory devices. The attitude in > question was certainly controversial. Any physician would know there was no > possibility whatsoever of successfully restoring life in the condition in > which Senna had been found. Professor Jos√© Pratas Vital, Director of the Egas Moniz Hospital in Lisbon, a neurosurgeon and Head of the Medical Staff at the Portuguese GP, offered a different opinion: > The people who conducted the autopsy stated that, on the evidence of his > injuries, Senna was dead. They could not say that. He had injuries which led > to his death, but at that point, the heart may still have been functioning. > Medical personnel attending an injured person, and who perceive that the > heart is still beating, have only two courses of action: One is to ensure > that the patient's respiratory passages remain free, which means that he can > breathe. They had to carry out an emergency tracheotomy. With oxygen and the > heart beating, there is another concern, which is the loss of blood. These > are the steps to be followed in any case involving serious injury, whether > on the street or on a racetrack. The rescue team can think of nothing else > at that moment except to assist the patient, particularly by immobilising > the cervical area. Then the injured person must be taken immediately to the > intensive care unit of the nearest hospital. Rog√©rio Morais Martins, creative director of Ayrton Senna Promotions (which became the Ayrton Senna Institute after Senna's death), stated that: > According to the first clinical bulletin read by Dr. Maria Teresa Fiandri at > 4:30 pm Ayrton Senna had brain damage with haemorrhaged shock and deep coma. > However, the medical staff did not note any chest or abdomen wound. The > haemorrhage was caused by the rupture of the temporal artery. The > neurosurgeon who examined Ayrton Senna at the hospital mentioned that the > circumstances did not call for surgery because the wound was generalised in > the cranium. At 6:05 pm Dr. Fiandri read another communiqu√©, her voice > shaking, announcing that Senna was dead. At that stage he was still > connected to the equipment that maintained his heartbeat. The release by the > Italian authorities of the results of Ayrton Senna's autopsy, revealing that > the driver had died instantaneously during the race at Imola, ignited still > more controversy. Now there were questions about the reactions of the race > director and the medical authorities.

Italian prosecution The Williams team was entangled for many years in Italian criminal court proceedings after prosecutors instigated manslaughter charges against key team officials. On 16 December 1997, Frank Williams and five others were acquitted of the charges, ending the threat of a boycott of Formula One in Italy. In a 381-page ruling, Judge Antonio Costanzo concluded that steering column failure was the probable cause of Senna's crash; however, there was no proof of negligence on the part of Head or Newey, or that they had designed the modifications in the first place. On 22 November 1999, an appeals court upheld the acquittals, rejecting a request from prosecutors to give one-year suspended sentences to Head and Newey. In April 2002, Senna's FW16 chassis number 02 was returned to the Williams team. The team reported that the car was in an advanced state of deterioration and was subsequently destroyed. Senna's helmet was returned to Bell, and was incinerated. The car's engine was returned to Renault, where its fate is unknown.Tom Rubython, \\"Life of Senna\\", chapter 33, \\"The Trial\\", p. 473. In January 2003, the Italian Supreme Court reopened the case, ruling that \\"material errors\\" had been made in Bologna court of appeal. On 27 May 2005, the court gave a full acquittal to Adrian Newey, while the case against Head was \\"timed out\\" under a statute of limitations. A retrial was ordered by Italy's highest court in 2005. On 13 April 2007, the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation delivered its own verdict (number 15050) stating that: \\"It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility for this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control\\". However, Head was not arrested since the Italian statute of limitations for culpable homicide was 7 years and 6 months, and the verdict was pronounced 13 years after the crash. The criminal charges had focused on the car's steering column, which was found to have sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed, causing the crash, and the Williams team conceded to this failure but only as caused by the crash impact. In the weeks preceding the San Marino Grand Prix, Senna reportedly had asked his team to alter the steering column in order to give him more room in the cockpit. Patrick Head and Adrian Newey satisfied Senna's request by having the FW16's existing shaft cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing that was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as there was insufficient time to instead manufacture a new steering shaft in time for the race. A 600-page technical report was submitted by the University of Bologna under Professor of Engineering Enrico Lorenzini and his team of specialists. The report concluded that fatigue cracks had developed through most of the steering column at the point where it had broken. Lorenzini stated: \\"It had been badly welded together about a third of the way down and couldn't stand the strain of the race. We discovered scratches on the crack in the steering rod. It seemed like the job had been done in a hurry but I can't say how long before the race. Someone had tried to smooth over the joint following the welding. I have never seen anything like it. I believe the rod was faulty and probably cracked even during the warm-up. Moments before the crash only a tiny piece was left connected and therefore the car didn't respond in the bend.\\" An analysis of the onboard camera video was submitted by Cineca, which tracked the movement of the steering wheel during the race. Having rotated in a fixed arc during the previous laps, during the final seconds a yellow button on the wheel moved several centimetres away from its normal trajectory, with the steering wheel tilting in its own plane, indicating a breaking steering column. Williams introduced its own video to prove the movement was normal in which David Coulthard manhandled an FW16B steering wheel, the effort required to deflect the wheel termed as \\"quite considerable\\". Michele Alboreto testified that the steering wheel movement was abnormal, stating that the video \\"proves that something was broken in Senna's Williams. No steering wheel moves a few centimetres.\\" In May 2011, Williams FW16 designer Adrian Newey expressed his views about the crash: > The honest truth is that no one will ever know exactly what happened. > There's no doubt the steering column failed and the big question was whether > it failed in the accident or did it cause the accident? It had fatigue > cracks and would have failed at some point. There is no question that its > design was very poor. However, all the evidence suggests the car did not go > off the track as a result of steering column failure... If you look at the > camera shots, especially from Michael Schumacher's following car, the car > didn't understeer off the track. It oversteered which is not consistent with > a steering column failure. The rear of the car stepped out and all the data > suggests that happened. Ayrton then corrected that by going to 50% throttle > which would be consistent with trying to reduce the rear stepping out and > then, half-a-second later, he went hard on the brakes. The question then is > why did the rear step out? The car bottomed much harder on that second lap > which again appears to be unusual because the tyre pressure should have come > up by then ‚Äì which leaves you expecting that the right rear tyre probably > picked up a puncture from debris on the track. If I was pushed into picking > out a single most likely cause that would be it.  Alternative hypotheses  =Driver error= Patrick Head, technical director of Williams, believed that Senna had made a driving error. Michael Schumacher had told him after the race that Senna's car looked 'nervous' the previous lap. Japanese broadcasts of the 1994 season show both Schumacher and Hill gesturing a bottoming out action with their hands while waiting for the restart of the San Marino race. Damon Hill said he is convinced that Senna made a mistake.http://www.carmag.co.za/speed_post/driver-error-caused-senna- death/ =Tyre puncture= Adrian Newey, who designed Senna's car, said he believes a tyre puncture may have caused Senna to crash. There was debris on the track following the JJ Lehto crash. Riccardo Patrese suffered a right rear tire failure at Tamburello during practice for the 1992 Grand Prix, yet his car (an active suspension FW14B) was seen to be spinning before even leaving the track.

In addition, Rex Trailer worked with guests who made educational presentations; took part in skits; and introduced the cartoons that rounded out the program, including Popeye, Davey and Goliath, Gumby, The Mighty Hercules among others. He was aided on the show by a succession of sidekicks over the years, including Pablo (played by Dick Kilbride), Cactus Pete, Sgt. Billy, Terrence Currier and Bill O'Brien, respectively. One recurring, memorable segment of Boomtown was set to the music of Hey, Look Me Over. Rex would appoint two children sheriff and deputy, and hand them a wanted poster showing another member of the studio audience thinly disguised. As the music played, the entire \\"posse\\" would march through the sheriff's office, waving for the camera (and for their families and friends watching; the segment ensured that every child had a chance to be on screen at least once). Trying for a prize, the young lawmen would attempt to pick out the person shown on the poster as he passed through the office. Trailer had moved from Philadelphia (where his TV series had ended) to Boston to host Boomtown on a short-term contract, but the show ended up running for almost two decades. Two-hundred thousand children appeared on Boomtown during its run, and another four million watched on TV or saw Rex at his many personal appearances across New England. Trailer essentially played himself, so he was never caught out of character: kind, quietly confident, eminently capable, and wholesome. Parents and children alike responded to Boomtown's subtle, integral messages encouraging respect for others and nature. Rex Trailer settled in the Boston area permanently where he remained a major local celebrity decades after the final episode of Boomtown aired. Trailer died in 2013. Trailer opened and closed each installment of the show with a live rendition of the Boomtown theme, a song that is said to have been \\"as sticky as the molasses used for grandma‚Äôs cookies on the old frontier.\\"\\"Rex Trailer: Lassoing a special honor\\" March 09, 2012 His audience participated by miming the shooting of a pistol into the air as they raucously sang along to the refrain of \\"Boom- Boom- Boomtown!\\" The complete lyrics to the song, Boomtown, are: Howdy there, folks, we're glad to meet you in Boom- Boom- Boomtown! There's a bunch of folks who'd like to greet you in Boom- Boom- Boomtown! You can bet we'll have lots of Western fun And excitement for you We'll ride and rope, do a square dance and shoot a gun And we'll sing a song or two Come along, folks, now we're gonna start the fun in Boom- Boom- Boomtown! From six to sixty there's something for everyone in Boom- Boom- Boomtown! So do-si-do and swing around, Get your gal and promenade down to Boom- Boom- Boomtown! Boomtown ran on WBZ-TV until the last day of 1974. Trailer and some of his associates briefly moved the show to a fledgling UHF station, Channel 25, but that station lacked the facilities to recapture the show's glory and audience. In the 1990s, Trailer and Sgt. Billy moseyed on over to cable television with a retrospective series called Boomtown Revisited. Little footage exists of Boomtown because the shows were mostly broadcast live, and any segments that were recorded were routinely taped over after broadcast. However, a documentary film titled Rex Trailer's Boomtown was produced by Milford, Massachusetts native Michael Bavaro. Bavaro used rare archival footage along with the memories of Boomtown fans to provide a nostalgic overview. The Emmy¬Æ nominated film aired on WBZ-TV on June 18, 2005 with encore broadcasts on WGBH in 2010, 2013, and is now sold in DVD format.

The Coronation of the Winner mosaic (a.k.a. the 'Bikini mosaic'), Villa Romana del Casale, Piazza Armerina, Sicily, 4th century AD The history of bras (brassi√®res; variously pronounced) is inextricably intertwined with the social history of the status of women, including the evolution of fashion and changing views of the female body. Women throughout history have used a variety of garments and devices to support, cover, restrain, reveal, or modify the appearance of their breasts. Bra- or bikini-like garments are depicted in art of female athletes of the Minoan civilization, ca. 14th century BC and there is some evidence to suggest that even from the Greco-Roman period women had developed specialized bra-like garments used for the purpose of supporting the breast. By the 14th century AD the proto-bra was in development in Europe and from approximately the 16th century AD onward, the undergarments of wealthier women in the Western world were dominated by the corset, which supported the breasts by transferring their weight to the rib cage. Corsets varied in length from short ones, which only supported the bust, to longer ones which were also used to shape the waist. In the latter part of the 19th century, women experimented with various alternatives such as splitting the corset into a girdle-like shaping device for the lower torso and transferring the upper part to devices suspended from the shoulder. By the early 20th century, garments more closely resembling contemporary bras had emerged, although large-scale commercial production did not occur until the 1930s. Since then bras have replaced corsets (although some women prefer camisoles) and some, as well, go without. The metal shortages of World War II encouraged the end of the corset. By the time the war ended, most fashion-conscious women in Europe and North America were wearing bras. From there the bra was adopted by women in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Antiquity Faience figurine of the Snake Goddess from ancient Crete, with the breasts supported by a fitted corset-like garment, circa 1600 BC =Greece= y-shaped breast bands on a bronze statue of Artemis, goddess of the hunt (mid-4th century BC). These bands form an archery harness, which a quiver of arrows attaches to. Marble statuette of Aphrodite in a gold \\"bikini\\"; Roman copy of a Hellenistic original found in Pompeii. The wearing of a specialized undergarment meant to support a woman's breasts may date back to ancient Greece. In Book 14 of Homer's Iliad, written in the archaic period of Classical Antiquity, the poet refers to Aphrodite's \\"embroidered girdle\\" or kestos himas as being \\"loosed from her breasts,\\" perhaps indicating that this may be a reference to a decorated breast-band rather than a girdle or belt, as is often interpreted. There is at least one example of late-Hellenic sculpture that seems to confirm this, depicting the goddess wrapping a str√≥phion (from str√≥phos \\"twisted band\\" + the diminutive suffix -ion) around her chest. However, it is currently impossible to tell whether the str√≥phion was an everyday garment worn by the average woman or an item of clothing reserved for certain situations or specific types of women. Some sources suggest that it may have been in use as a common undergarment while others are doubtful. There is very little visual evidence for its existence, and even less evidence for its specialized use as an undergarment. Most early Grecian sculpture and vase paintings that depict women in states of undress show no indication of any kind of breast-band, instead revealing the shape of the breast through draped clothing, or even the nipple itself, with no sign of an intervening item of clothing between chiton and skin. However, the literary attestation is somewhat more plentiful, and the str√≥phion is mentioned specifically in Aristophanes' plays Lysistrata and Women at the Thesmophoria. =Rome= The gold body chain from the Hoxne hoard resembles a jeweled version of the crossed breast band Detail from a wall painting at alt=There is considerably more evidence for the use of the Roman strophium, their adaptation of the str√≥phion, which was also referred to as the fascia, fasciola, taenia, or mamillare. This garment, which could be made from a variety of materials, was mentioned in writings by Martial, Ovid, and the Scriptores Historiae Augustae. The Middle Ages Painting illustrating Renaissance ideals. = Western Europe = Until fairly recently, not much was known about supportive garments with defined cups that may have existed before the invention of the corset in the late Middle Ages. That changed when, in 2008, four lace-decorated undergarments were found among 3,000 textile fragments during a renovation project in Lengberg Castle, Austria. All four garments were carbon-dated to the 15th century, and illustrate three different styles: the first and second are high-necked, with fabric stretching above the cups to cover the d√©colletage, and are sleeveless and cut just below the bust; the third has two broad shoulder straps and a possible back strap; the fourth garment most resembles a modern longline bra, with linen cups joined vertically at the center of the breast and a linen extension cut at about to the level of the ribcage and fastened with a row of eyelets on the front left side of the body. It is difficult to tell how widespread this type of garment was at the time, but there is both artistic and literary evidence that suggests they may have been more prevalent than is commonly thought. Both Henri de Mondeville, surgeon to King Phillip the Fair of France and Konrad Stolle, writing over a hundred years apart (c. 1315 and c. 1480 respectively) mention \\"breast bags\\" or \\"shirts with bags\\" that women used to contain their breasts. Stolle calls these inventions \\"indecent\\" and another, anonymous, writer of 15th century Germany talks of how many women would make these garments and then wear them, and says of one woman: \\"all the young men that look at her, can see her beautiful breasts...\\" The Corset The inventor of the corset is unknown, but its introduction to France is widely credited to Queen Catherine de' Medici, who married King Henry II in 1533. The earliest extant corset known of dates from the late 16th century. It belonged to Pfalzgrafin Dorothea Sabine von Neuberg and was buried with her in her tomb in Lauingen, Germany in 1598. At this time in English, corsets were known as \\"a pair of bodies.\\" The Pfalzgrafin's pair are made of lightweight ivory-colored silk lined with linen and enforced with whalebone or reeds; they have a wide casing in the center front designed to house a busk made of wood or horn and lace up the back. Re-Emergence of the Bra = Victorian Dress Reform Movement = The evolution of the bra from the corset was driven by two parallel movements: health professionals' concerns about the cruel, constraining effects of the corset, and the clothing reform movement of feminists who saw that greater participation of women in society would require emancipation from corsetry. Prominent among these were the Rational Dress Society, the National Dress Reform Association, and the Reform Dress Association. In practice, early bras made little market penetration. They were expensive, and only educated wealthy reformers wore them to any extent. American women who made important contributions included Amelia Bloomer (1818‚Äì1894) (\\"When you find a burden in belief or apparel, cast it off\\") and Dr. Mary Edwards Walker (1832‚Äì1919). =Early Bra Designs and Patents= There are considerable differences of opinion as to who \\"invented\\" the modern brassi√®re. Patent dates indicate some of the landmark developments; a large number of patents for bra-like devices were granted in the 19th century. However, what is regarded as the world's oldest push-up bra was discovered in storage at the Science Museum in London. Designed to enhance cleavage, the bra is said to be from the early 19th century. A bra-like device that gave a symmetrical rotundity to the wearer's breasts was patented in 1859 by Henry S. Lesher of Brooklyn, New York. In 1863, a \\"corset substitute\\" was patented by Luman L. Chapman of Camden, New Jersey. Historians refer to it as a \\"proto- bra.\\" In 1876, dressmaker Olivia Flynt was granted four patents covering the \\"true Corset\\" or \\"Flynt Waist.\\" It was aimed at larger-breasted women. Reformers stimulated demand for and probably purchased these early garments on \\"hygienic\\" grounds because of their concerns about the corset. Initially Flynt's garments were only available by mail order, but they eventually appeared in department and clothing stores and catalogues. Her designs won a bronze medal at the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics Association in 1878, at the Cotton Centennial Exposition in Atlanta in 1884‚Äì5, and at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. According to Life magazine, in 1889 Herminie Cadolle of France invented the first modern bra.Pechter E. A new method for determining bra size and predicting post-augmentation breast size. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 102 (4) September 1998, 1259‚Äì1265 It appeared in a corset catalogue as a two-piece undergarment, which she originally called the corselet gorge, and later le bien-√™tre (or \\"the well-being\\"). Her garment effectively cut the traditional corset in two: The lower part was a corset for the waist and the upper part supported the breasts with shoulder straps. Her description reads \\"designed to sustain the bosom and supported by the shoulders.\\" She patented her invention and showed it at the Great Exhibition of 1889. The company, still family-owned, claims today that Herminie \\"freed women by inventing the first Bra.\\" By 1905, the upper half was sold separately as a soutien-gorge, the name by which bras are still known in France. She also introduced the use of \\"rubber thread\\" or elastic. In 1893, Marie Tucek received a U.S. patent for a device that consisted of separate pockets for each breast above a metal supporting plate and shoulder straps fastened by hook-and-eye. This invention more closely resembled the modern bra known today, and was a precursor to the underwire bra. Home-sewn garments competed with factory-made, ready-to-wear garments. The bra was at first an alternative to the corset, as a neglig√©e or at-home wear, or worn by women with medical issues stemming from corsets. After the straight-fronted corset became fashionable in the early 20th century, a bra or \\"bust supporter\\" became a necessity for full-busted women because the straight-fronted corset did not offer as much support and containment as the Victorian styles. Early bras were either wrap-around bodices or boned, close-fitting camisoles (both worn over the corset). They were designed to hold the bust in and down against the corset, which provided upward support. Advertising of the times, typically in periodicals, stressed the advantages of bras in health and comfort over corsets and portrayed garments with shoulder supports in a mono-bosom style and with limited adaptability. Their major appeal was to those for whom lung function and mobility were priorities, rather than outer appearance.

Jacob's brassiere, from the original patent application. 1913 Bust reducing bra US Patent 1156808. The first modern bra was patented by the German Christine Hardt in 1889. Sigmund Lindauer from Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, Germany developed a bra for mass production in 1912 and patented it in 1913. It was mass-produced by Mechanischen Trikotweberei Ludwig Maier und Cie. in B√∂blingen, Germany. With metal shortages, World War I encouraged the end of the corset. By the time the war ended, most fashion- conscious women in Europe and North America were wearing bras. From there the bra was adopted by women in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In 1910, Mary Phelps Jacob (known later in life as Caresse Crosby), a 19-year-old New York socialite, purchased a sheer evening gown for a debutante ball. At that time, the only acceptable undergarment was a corset stiffened with whalebone. Mary had large breasts and found that the whalebone visibly poked out around her plunging neckline and from under the sheer fabric. Dissatisfied with this arrangement, she worked with her maid to fashion two silk handkerchiefs together with some pink ribbon and cord. Her innovation drew immediate attention that evening and, at the request of family and friends, she made more of her new device. When she received a request for one from a stranger, who offered a dollar for her efforts, she realized that her device could turn into a viable business. On 3 November 1914, the U.S. Patent Office issued the first U.S. patent for the \\"Backless Bra.\\" Crosby's patent was for a device that was lightweight, soft, comfortable to wear, and naturally separated the breasts, unlike the corset, which was heavy, stiff, uncomfortable, and had the effect of creating a \\"monobosom.\\" Crosby managed to secure a few orders from department stores, but her business never took off. Her husband Harry Crosby discouraged her from pursuing the business and persuaded her to close it. She later sold the bra patent to the Warners Brothers Corset Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut, for $1,500 (roughly equivalent to $ in current dollars). Warner manufactured the \\"Crosby\\" bra for a while, but it did not become a popular style and eventually was discontinued. Warner went on to earn more than $15 million from the bra patent over the next 30 years. Bras became more common and widely promoted over the course of the 1910s, aided by the continuing trend towards lighter, shorter corsets that offered increasingly less bust support and containment. In 1917 at the beginning of the U.S. involvement in World War I, the U.S. War Industries Board asked women to stop buying corsets to free up metal for war production. This was said to have saved some 28,000 tons of metal, enough to build two battleships. It has been said that the bra took off the way it did in large part because of World War I, which shook up gender roles by putting many women to work in factories and uniforms for the first time. The war also influenced social attitudes toward women and helped to liberate them from corsets. But women were already moving into the retail and clerical sectors. Thus the bra emerged from something that was once discreetly tucked into the back pages of women's magazines in the 1890s, to prominent display in department stores such as Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery Ward by 1918. Advertising was now promoting the shaping of the bust to contemporary fashion demands, and sales reflected this. =The 1920s= As the corset became shorter during the later 1910s, it provided less support to the bust. By 1920 the corset started at the waist, and bust containment yielded entirely to the bra. A low, sloping bustline became more fashionable. Brassieres from the late 1910s and early 1920s were merely slightly shaped bandeaus (bandeaux) style, holding the bust in and down by means of a clip attached to the corset. This culminated in the \\"boyish\\" silhouette of the Flapper era of the 1920s, with little bust definition. The term (which in the mid-1910s referred to preteen and early-teenage girls) was adopted by the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in the 1920s for their younger adult customers. The androgynous figure then in style downplayed women's natural curves through the use of a bandeau bra, which flattened breasts. It was relatively easy for small-busted women to conform to the flat-chested look of the Flapper era. Women with larger breasts tried products like the popular Symington Side Lacer that, when laced at the sides, pulled and helped to flatten women's chests. Yet some \\"bras\\" of the early 1920s were little more than camisoles. In 1922, Russian immigrant Ida Rosenthal was a seamstress at the small New York City dress shop Enid Frocks. She and her husband William Rosenthal, along with shop owner Enid Bissett, changed the look of women's fashion. They noticed that a bra that fit one woman did not fit another woman with the same bra size. With $4,500 invested in their new business, they developed bras for all ages. Their innovation was designed to make their dresses look better on the wearer by increasing the shaping of the bandeau bra to enhance and support women's breasts. They named the company Maiden Form, a deliberate contrast with the name of a competitor, \\"Boyishform Company.\\" Maiden Form routed Boyishform by 1924, accenting and lifting rather than flattening the bust. In 1927, William Rosenthal, the president of Maiden Form, filed patents for nursing, full-figured, and the first seamed uplift bra. These fashion changes coincided with health professionals beginning to link breast care and comfort to motherhood and lactation, and campaigned against breast flattening. The emphasis shifted from minimizing the breasts to uplifting and accenting them. Women, especially the younger set, welcomed the bra as a modern garment. While manufacturing was beginning to become more organized, homemade bras and bandeaux were still quite popular, usually made of white cotton, but they were little more than bust bodices with some separation. Drawing of a woman wearing bra, from 28 February 1930 United States Patent 1825579 application =The 1930s= The word \\"brassiere\\" was gradually shortened to \\"bra\\" in the 1930s. According to a 1934 survey by Harper's Bazaar, \\"bra\\" was the most commonly used expression for the garment among college women. The bra was becoming more sophisticated, and home-sewn versions vanished in the 1930s. In October 1932, the S.H. Camp and Company correlated the size and pendulousness of a woman's breasts to letters of the alphabet, A through D. Camp's advertising featured letter-labeled profiles of breasts in the February 1933 issue of Corset and Underwear Review. In 1937, Warner began to feature cup sizing in its products. Two other companies, Model and Fay-Miss, began to offer A, B, C and D cups in the late 1930s. Catalog companies continued to use the designations Small, Medium and Large through the 1940s. Adjustable bands were introduced using multiple eye and hook positions in the 1930s. As with other women's products, consumer adoption was encouraged by successful advertising and marketing campaigns. Saleswomen played a key role, helping clients find the right garment, as did the changing role of women in society. Much of this marketing was aimed at young women. Bras rapidly became a major industry over the 1930s, with improvements in fiber technology, fabrics, colours, patterns, and options, and did much better than the retail industry in general. Innovations included Warners' use of elastic, the adjustable strap, the sized cup, and padded bras for smaller- breasted women. In the US production moved outside of New York and Chicago, and advertising started to exploit Hollywood glamour and become more specialised. Department stores developed fitting areas, and customers, stores and manufacturers all benefited. Manufacturers even arranged fitting training courses for saleswomen. International sales started to form an increasing part of the U.S. bra manufacturer's market. Prices started to make bras available to a wider market, and home-made competition dwindled. Other major manufacturers of the 1930s included Triumph, Maidenform, Gossard, (Courtaulds), Spirella, Spencer, Twilfit, and Symington. The culturally preferred silhouette among Western women during the 1930s was a pointy bust, which further increased demand for a forming garment. Drawing of a woman wearing bra, from 1947 United States patent application =The 1940s= Two women show off a new uniform - including a plastic 'bra' - designed to help prevent occupational accidents among female war workers in Los Angeles in 1943.The Second World War had a major impact on clothing. In the United States, military women were enlisted for the first time in the lower ranks and were fitted with uniform underwear. Willson Goggles, a Pennsylvania firm that manufactured safety equipment for manual workers, is believed to have introduced the plastic \\"SAF-T-BRA\\", designed to protect women on the factory floor. Advertising appealed to both patriotism and the concept that bras and girdles were somehow \\"protection\\". Dress codes appearedfor example, Lockheed informed their workers that bras must be worn because of \\"good taste, anatomical support, and morale\\". Military terminology crept into product marketing, as represented by the highly structured, conically pointed Torpedo or Bullet bra, designed for \\"maximum projection\\". The bullet bra was worn by the Sweater Girl, a busty and wholesome \\"girl next door\\" whose tight-fitting outergarments accentuated her artificially enhanced curves. Underwire began to be used in bra construction. Actresses like Jane Russell appeared in photographs wearing the new bras that emphasized the \\"lift and separate\\" design, which influenced later bra design. For the movie, The Outlaw, which features actress Jane Russell, the producer and airplane designer Howard Hughes constructed the Cantilever bra for Russell to wear in the movie. Hughes constructed the bra so that it would fit and support Jane Russell's breasts. Hughes created the bra on the basis of bridge building. After seeing Jane Russell and her bust in the movie, women sought to recreate the look on their own chests. The war presented unique challenges for industry. Women's occupations shifted dramatically, with far more employed outside the home and in industry. Severe material shortages limited design choices. Advertising, promotion, and consumerism were limited but started to appear directed at minorities (e.g., Ebony in 1945) and teens. Many manufacturers only survived by making tents and parachutes in addition to bras. American industry was now freed from European influences, particularly French, and it became more distinctive. Again there was concern about the use of badly needed steel in corsets and the British Government carried out a survey of women's usage of underwear in 1941. This showed that \\"on average, women owned 1.2 bras (housewives 0.8 and agricultural workers 1.9)\\". =The 1950s= Patti Page wearing a bullet bra in 1955. Following the Second World War, new kinds of material were increasingly available, and production and marketing increased, creating a demand for a greater variety of consumer goods, including bras. The baby boom specifically created a demand for maternity and nursing bras and television provided new promotional opportunities. Manufacturers responded with new fabrics, colours, patterns, styles, padding and elasticity. Hollywood fashion and glamour influenced women's fashion choices including bras like the cone-shaped, spiral-stitched bullet bra popularized by actresses like Patti Page, Marilyn Monroe, and Lana Turner, who was nicknamed the \\"Sweater Girl\\". Bullet bras allowed women to add a cup size to their bust. Bras for pre-teen and girls entering puberty were first marketed during the 1950s. Prior to the introduction of training bras, young girls in Western countries usually wore a one-piece \\"waist\\" or camisole without cups or darts. =The 1960s= The 1960s reflected increasing interest in quality and fashion. Maternity and mastectomy bras began to find a new respectability, and the increasing use of washing machines created a need for products that were more durable. While girdles gave way to pantyhose, the bra continued to evolve. Marketing campaigns like those for the \\"Snoozable\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams\\"Maidenform Sweet Dreams Campaign (November 1962). Family Circle Magazine. promoted wearing a bra 24 hours a day. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \\"Freedom Trash Can.\\" These included bras, which were among items the protestors called \\"instruments of female torture\\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity. Individuals who were present said that no one burned a bra nor did anyone take off her bra. However, respected author Joseph Campbell found a local news story that contradicted the feminists' statements, reporting that lingerie was in fact burned at least briefly that day. An article on page 4 of the Atlantic City Press reported, \\"Bra-burners blitz boardwalk'. It stated, \\"As the bras, girdles, falsies, curlers, and copies of popular women‚Äôs magazines burned in the Freedom Trash Can, the demonstration reached the pinnacle of ridicule when the participants paraded a small lamb wearing a gold banner worded Miss America. \\" A second story in the same newspaper written by Jon Katz did not mention burning lingerie, but Campbell interviewed Katz. Katz, who was present that day, confirmed that bras and other items had been set on fire: \\"...the fire was small, and quickly was extinguished.\\" The feminists insisted afterward that the newspaper report was wrong. Female reporter Lindsy Van Gelder who covered the protest drew an analogy between the feminist protesters and Vietnam War protesters who burned their draft cards, and the parallel between protesters burning their draft cards and women burning their bras was encouraged by some organizers including Robin Morgan. \\"The media picked up on the bra part,\\" Carol Hanisch said later. \\"I often say that if they had called us 'girdle burners,' every woman in America would have run to join us.\\" Feminism and \\"bra-burning\\" became linked in popular culture. The analogous term \\"jockstrap-burning\\" has since been coined as a reference to masculism. While feminist women state they did not literally burn bras that day, some stopped wearing them in protest. Author and feminist Bonnie J. Dow has suggested that the association between feminism and bra-burning was encouraged by individuals who opposed the feminist movement. \\"Bra-burning\\" created an image that women weren't really seeking freedom from sexism, but were attempting to assert themselves as sexual beings. This might lead individuals to believe, as she wrote in her 2003 article \\"Feminism, Miss America, and Media Mythology,\\" that the women were merely trying to be \\"trendy, and to attract men.\\" Women associated with an act like symbolically burning their bra may be seen by some as law-breaking radicals, eager to shock the public. This view may have supported the efforts of opponents to feminism and their desire to invalidate the movement. Some feminist activists believe that anti- feminists use the bra burning myth and the subject of going braless to trivialize what the protesters were trying to accomplish at the feminist 1968 Miss America protest and the feminist movement in general.Lee, Jennifer Feminism Has a Bra-Burning Myth Problem 11 June 2014 Time  Swimsuit and bra designs  A Canadian Wonderbra branded plunge, push-up bra, circa 1975 On 4 June 1962, Rudy Gernreich's single-piece, topless monokini swimsuit received worldwide media attention.

In the process, he has ripped out the boning and wiring that made American swimsuits seagoing corsets.\\" Gernreich followed that in October 1964 with the \\"No Bra\\", a soft-cup, light-weight, seamless, sheer nylon and elastic tricot bra in sizes 32 to 36, A and B cups, manufactured by Exquisite Form. His minimalist bra was a revolutionary departure from the heavy, torpedo-shaped bras of the 1950s, initiating a trend toward more natural shapes and soft, sheer fabrics. He also designed an \\"All-in-None\\" design with a deep, plunging front, and a \\"No-Back\\" long-line version, which featured a contoured stretch-waistband that allowed a woman to wear a backless dress. The Wonderbra was created in 1964 by Louise Poirier for Canadelle, a Canadian lingerie company. It has 54 design elements that lift and support the bustline while creating a deep plunge and push-together effect. First-year sales for the Wonderbra were approximated at US$120 million. They repositioned Wonderbra as a romantic, fashionable and sexy brand. =The 1970s = Germaine Greer's book The Female Eunuch (1970) became associated with the anti-bra movement because she pointed out how restrictive and uncomfortable a bra could be. \\"Bras are a ludicrous invention\\", she wrote, \\"but if you make bralessness a rule, you're just subjecting yourself to yet another repression.\\" In the 1970s, like other garment makers, bra manufacturers moved production offshore. The evolution of the bra reflects the constantly changing idea of what an \\"ideal\\" woman should look likeflat, round, pointy, conical, or even \\"natural\\". The contemporary bra also reflects advances in manufacturing and availability of fabric types and colours, enabling it to be transformed from a utilitarian item to a fashion statement, countering the negative attitudes some women had about bras. Designers have also incorporated numerous devices to produce varying shapes, cleavage, and to give women bras they could wear with open- back dresses, off-the-shoulder dresses, plunging necklines, and the like. Jogbra, back view with packaging, \\"The Professional Athletic Support Bra That Keeps Breasts from Bouncing\\" With the growing popularity of jogging and other forms of exercise, it became apparent that there was a need for an athletic garment for women's breasts. In 1977, Lisa Lindahl, Polly Smith and Hinda Mille invented the first sports bra in the costume shop of Royall Tyler Theatre at the University of Vermont. One of the original Jogbras is bronzed and on display near the costume shop of the theatre. Two others are housed by the Smithsonian and another by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. Sportshape JogBra Advertisement, 1986, emphasizes support for larger breasted women who choose to be active = The 1980s = Throughout the 1980s fashion led the way in the look and feel of bras. Western TV shows featured classy, powerful, and well-formed ladies, usually donning low cut tops to show an enhanced chest with an equally classy matching bra. The onset of classy and stylish Teddy suits also encompassed this decade and sales of silicone increased the need for bigger and more supportive bras. Models and celebrities all donned fashionable and extravagant bras, showing these off at red carpets events become the norm. In contrast, feminist Susan Brownmiller in her book Femininity (1984) took the position that women without bras shock and anger men because men \\"implicitly think that they own breasts and that only they should remove bras.\\" = The 1990s = Manufacturers' marketing and advertising often appeals to fashion and image over fit, comfort and function. Since about 1994, manufacturers have re-focused their advertising, moving from advertising functional bras that emphasize support and foundation, to selling lingerie that emphasize fashion while sacrificing basic fit and function, like linings under scratchy lace. = The 2000s = Two design challenges that bra manufacturers face at present seem paradoxical. On the one hand, there is a demand for minimal bras that allow plunging necklines and reduce interference with the lines of outer garments, such as the shelf bra. On the other hand, body mass and bust size is increasing, leading to a higher demand for larger sizes. Over a 10-year period, the most common size purchased in the UK went from 34B to 36C. In 2001, 27% of UK sales were D or larger. The 2000s brought two large design changes to the bra. The molded one-piece, seamless bra cup became ubiquitous. They are heat-molded around round forms of synthetic fibers or foam that keeps their rounded shape. This construction can include padded bras, contour bras and so-called T-shirt bras. Also new and ubiquitous in the 2000s was the popularity of printed designs such as floral or patterned prints. Bras are a billion-dollar industry ($15 billion in the US in 2001, ¬£1 billion in UK.) that continues to grow. Large corporations such as HanesBrands Inc. control most bra manufacturing, Gossard, Berlei and Courtaulds with 34% of the UK market. Victoria's Secret is an exception. Feminist author Iris Marion Young wrote in 2005 that the bra \\"serves as a barrier to touch\\" and that a braless woman is \\"deobjectified\\", eliminating the \\"hard, pointy look that phallic culture posits as the norm.\\" Without a bra, in her view, women's breasts are not consistently shaped objects but change as the woman moves, reflecting the natural body. Other feminist anti-bra arguments from Young in 2005 include that training bras are used to indoctrinate girls into thinking about their breasts as sexual objects and to accentuate their sexuality. Young also wrote in 2007 that, in American culture, breasts are subject to \\"[c]apitalist, patriarchal American media-dominated culture [that] objectifies breasts before such a distancing glance that freezes and masters.\\" Academic Wendy Burns-Ardolino wrote in 2007 that women's decision to wear bras is mediated by the \\"male gaze\\". =Modern production= Like other clothing, bras were initially sewn by small production companies and supplied to various retailers. The term \\"cup\\" was not used to describe bras until 1916, and manufacturers relied on stretchable cups to accommodate different sized breasts.{rp73}} Women with larger or pendulous breasts had the choice of long-line bras, built-up backs, wedge-shaped inserts between the cups, wider straps, power Lastex, firm bands under the cup, and even light boning. In October 1932, the S.H. Camp and Company correlated the size and pendulousness of a woman's breasts to letters of the alphabet: A, B, C and D. Camp's advertising featured letter-labeled profiles of breasts in the February 1933 issue of Corset and Underwear Review. In 1937, Warner began to feature cup sizing in its products. Adjustable bands were introduced using multiple eye and hook positions in the 1930s. There is an urban legend that the bra was invented by a man named Otto Titzling (\\"tit sling\\") who lost a lawsuit with Phillip de Bra (\\"fill up the bra\\"). This originated with the 1971 book Bust- Up: The Uplifting Tale of Otto Titzling and the Development of the Bra and was propagated in a comedic song from the movie Beaches. Non-Western Equivalents While the modern bra has evolved, almost directly, from the proto-bra of the Middle Ages, other cultures across the world and across history have invented garments that serve similar purposes. This is only a short list; for a more in-depth view, please see each garment's separate page. = China = The dudou (Chinese: ËÇöÂÖú, ÂÖúËÇö, or ÂÖúÂÖú; also known by other names) is a traditional Chinese undergarment used to flatten the breasts and preserve the stomach qi. =India= Although the majority of female figures in ancient Indian sculptures are devoid of a blouse, there are several instances of ancient Indian women wearing bras. The first historical reference to bras in India is found during the rule of King Harshavardhana (1st century AD). Sewn bras and blouses were very much in vogue during the Vijayanagara empire and the cities brimmed with tailors who specialized in tight fitting of these garments. The half-sleeved tight bodice or kanchuka figures prominently in the literature of the period, especially Basavapurana (1237 AD), which says kanchukas were worn by young girls as well.

She is known mostly for her mastery of figurative language. Little is known about the exact date and location of her birth, but it is assumed that Pinar was an educated member of the upper class. This much can be deduced from the fact that she was one of the few female poets whose works were included in the 15th century Spanish poetic songbook known as Cancionero general. Her work must have been deemed exemplary at the time as the songbook was compiled with the intent to make the works of renowned poets more accessible to the public. She also composed her poems in the Castilian dialect which was characteristic of the educated upper class of her time. Only four of her works are known to have been published, two of which were later attributed to the \\"dama\\" (lady) or \\"Se√±ora\\" Florencia Pinar. Both of these titles connote a certain elevated level of social status. There have also been a number of additional poems dating back to the 15th century that also denote a poet by the name of \\"Pinar.\\" For the most part, many of these have been attributed to Florencia's brother Geronimo de Pinar - who was also a writer of many canciones. However, there is still some speculation about how many of them may have actually been written by Florencia Pinar herself. Pinar's poems are canciones - a popular 15th century - that usually discussed lighter themes. Works Of the four works attributed to Pinar, \\"Canci√≥n de una dama que dice Florencia Pinar\\" (Song by a Dame Called Florencia Pinar), \\"Glosa de Florencia\\" (Florencia's Gloss), \\"Cancion de Florencia Pinar\\" (Song of Florencia Pinar), \\"and Otra canci√≥n de la misma se√±ora a unas perdices que le enviaron vivas\\" (Another Song of the Same Lady About Some Partridges Sent to Her Alive), the latter is the most well known for its symbolism and hidden themes: Florencia del Pinar original Julie Allen translation Destas aves su nacion These birds were born Es contar con alegria, Singing for joy, Y de vellas en prision Such softness imprisoned Siento yo grave pasion, Gives me such sorrow--- Sin sentir nadie a mia. Yet no one weeps for me. Ellas lloran que se vieron They cry that they flew Sin temor de ser cativas, Fearless of capture Y a quien eran mas esquivas And those whom shunned Esos mismos las prendier Were those who seized them: Sus nombres mi vida son Their names write my life Que va perdiendo alegria, Which goes on, losing joy; Y de vellas en prision Such softness imprisoned Siento yo grave pasion, Gives me such sorrow--- Sin sentir nadie a mia. Yet no one weeps for me. Samantha Pious translation These birds were born to sing with joy in flying free. For them, encaged, I ache with rage but no one mourns for me. They cry to find themselves enslaved to masters whom they used to scorn. The very men they hated most can purchase them and take them home. In their names I write my life, which goes on losing liberty. For them, encaged, I ache with rage but no one mourns for me. It is in this work that Pinar shows her ability to play with language and create conceits (conceptismo), by showing love's dual role of providing both pleasure and pain. Also evident is her characteristic use of indirect sexual allusions. During this time period partridges served as an archetype of female promiscuity because female partridges are known to be easily impregnated birds. This playful use of symbolism is one of the distinguishing features of Pinar's poetry. The prevailing theme of her poetry is love, but there is also much ambiguity in her tone. Throughout the centuries, scholars have often speculated about whether this love about which she so frequently writes is platonic or sexual in nature. However, there is a very prominent discussion about Pinar's own feelings of entrapment within her poems. The encaged bird is clearly a reflection of Pinar herself as she chooses to twice repeat the lines \\"Yet no one weeps for me\\" even as she is reflecting on the partridge. This consistent repetition highlights not only her sadness and isolation, but also ensures that the reader returns to the idea that the bird is a metaphor for her own capture. In her Cancione de Florencia Pinar, Pinar also delves into a discussion on love. She compares love to a worm that has burrowed its way into the body and likens love to a \\"cancer of nature who devours all the healthy flesh\\" (lines 7 - 8) right before harshly stating that \\"if he enters one's entrails he can leave only by tearing them out\\" (lines 11 ‚Äì 12). These images are all very graphic, but allow the reader to clearly visualize her view on love. Her writing is clearly very evocative and fleshes out the painful paradox of love.

Established in 1738 during the reign of Empress Anna, the academy was known as the Imperial Ballet School until the Soviet era, when, after a brief hiatus, the school was re-established as the Leningrad State Choreographic Institute. In 1957, the school was renamed in honor of the pedagogue Agrippina Vaganova, who cultivated the method of classical ballet training that has been taught there since the late 1920s. Many of the world's leading ballet schools have adopted elements of the Vaganova method into their own training. The Vaganova Academy is the associate school of the Mariinsky Ballet, one of the world's leading ballet companies. Students of the school have found employment with ballet and contemporary companies worldwide, such as the Bolshoi Ballet, The Royal Ballet, American Ballet Theatre and the Mikhailovsky Ballet. History The school was established as the Imperial Theatrical School by decree of the Empress Anna on 4 May 1738 with the French Ballet Master Jean-Baptiste Lande as its director. The first classes occupied empty rooms in the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg and the first students were twelve boys and twelve girls. The purpose of the school was to form Russia's first professional dance company, which led to the formation of the Imperial Russian Ballet, the school becoming known as the Imperial Ballet School. The Imperial Russian Ballet is the direct predecessor of today's Mariinsky Ballet. 2 Rossi Street at the beginning of the 20th century Nearly all the early teachers at the school were from Western Europe, including Franz Hilferding and Giovanni Canzianni. The first Russian teacher to join the school was Ivan Valberg. After the spread of ballet in Europe, the development of the school was influenced by a number of other teachers and methods, including Christian Johannson, a student of August Bournonville, and the Italian methods of Enrico Cecchetti, Pierina Legnani and Carlotta Brianza. Other renowned 19th-century dancers and ballet masters who taught at and were influential in the development in the school include Charles Didelot, Jules Perrot, Arthur Saint- L√©on, Lev Ivanov, Marius Petipa and Mikhail Fokine. Since 1836, the school has been situated at 2 Rossi Street in St. Petersburg (known as Leningrad after 1924 until the collapse of the Soviet Union). The Imperial Ballet School was dissolved by the new Soviet government, but later re-established on the same site as the Leningrad State Choreographic School. The Imperial Russian Ballet was also dissolved and re-established as the Soviet Ballet. The company was later renamed the Kirov Ballet following the assassination of Sergey Kirov in 1938. Despite later being given the current name Mariinsky Ballet, the company is still commonly known as the Kirov Ballet by the majority of Western audiences and the company still use that title when touring internationally. Vaganova Medium close-up of the main entryway. Agrippina Vaganova brought perhaps the most important developments in modern Russian Ballet. She graduated from the Imperial Ballet School in 1897 and danced with the Imperial Ballet, retiring from the stage early to pursue her teaching career following the Revolution. As the Soviet government had not yet re-established the school, Vaganova began her teaching career at the privately owned School of Russian Ballet, eventually joining the new Leningrad State Choreographic School in 1920. Vaganova was to become a highly renowned ballet teacher and is most noted for authoring The Principles of Classical Dance, which outlines the training system she created and which heads the list of the numerous works produced by teachers of the school. Vaganova's students would become some of the most famous ballet dancers of all time, and in recognition of her achievements, the school was named in her honour in 1957, six years after her death. There are a number of variations in the name of the school, but the official title in current use in the English-speaking world is Vaganova Ballet Academy. Today =Overview= The Vaganova Ballet Academy which some consider the source of modern ballet is now over 275 years old.Russian Ballet Celebrates 275 (!!!) Years , Dance Magazine, 2013, retrieved 13 March 2014 The Academy has over 300 students. As in other similar institutions, competition for a place at the school is very fierce, with over 3,000 children auditioning each year, 300 of these being from St. Petersburg. Approximately 60 students are selected annually, with some 25 eventually graduating from the school having completed the full course of training. Students are evaluated annually as there are progressively fewer places in each grade. The school employs approximately 75 dance teachers, 30 piano teachers, 40 academic teachers and 40 accompanists. The Rector of the academy is Nikolay Tsiskaridze and the Artistic Director is Zhanna Ayupova. =Auditions= Auditions for the school begin in June, and children must be at least 10 years to audition. The audition process is divided into three sections. * Aptitude: to assess the candidate's proportions, height of jump, degree of turnout and general appearance etc. * Physical: an examination by a specialist medical practitioner to assess the physiological possibilities of the candidate * Artistic: to assess the candidate's musicality, rhythm, co-ordination and artistic talent =Training= All students at the school begin by studying a program of dance training, secondary school level education, French language and piano lessons. As they progress through the school, the program becomes more intensive, with new subjects being added to the curriculum as the students become more advanced. In the first year, students study classical and historical dance. They progress to character dance in the fourth year and pas de deux and mime in the sixth year. At the end of the 8th year of training, all students dance in a graduation gala at the Mariinsky Theatre. The most successful students may be offered a contract with the Mariinsky Ballet company, with the majority seeking employment with ballet companies in Russia and worldwide, including leading companies such as the Bolshoi Ballet, The Royal Ballet, and the American Ballet Theatre.

Of all the towns in the area, it was experiencing the most growth, mostly because of immigration and the conversion of old livestock fields into terrain for construction. Galapagar is served both by Cercanias train service at its station Galapagar- La Navata and to one end by the interurbano bus service linking it with Moncloa, a district of Madrid. The name Galapagar comes from the Spanish gal√°pago, meaning turtle, as the town centre was settled near a lake full of turtles. The town first appears as a village in the eleventh century, its importance due to the frequent hunting expeditions by the Spanish royalty, and being a main stop on the road from the capital to the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. Sights in the town include the church of The Asunci√≥n (Assumption). The Spanish writer Jacinto Benavente, who won the 1922 Nobel Prize for Literature, is buried here.

Here, black grouse males gather in a quagmire and the females then arrive and observe the male before choosing one. Mate choice is one of the primary mechanisms under which evolution can occur. It is characterized by a ‚Äúselective response by animals to particular stimuli‚Äù which can be observed as behavior.Bateson, Paul Patrick Gordon. ‚ÄúMate Choice.‚Äù Mate Choice, Cambridge University Press, 1985 In other words, before an animal engages with a potential mate, they first evaluate various aspects of that mate which are indicative of quality‚Äîsuch as the resources or phenotypes they have‚Äîand evaluate whether or not those particular trait(s) are somehow beneficial to them. The evaluation will then incur a response of some sort. These mechanisms are a part of evolutionary change because they operate in a way that causes the qualities that are desired in a mate to be more frequently passed on to each generation over time. For example, if female peacocks desire mates who have a colourful plumage, then this trait will increase in frequency over time as male peacocks with a colourful plumage will have more reproductive success. Further investigation of this concept, has found that it is in fact the specific trait of blue and green colour near the eyespot that seems to increase the females likelihood of mating with a specific peacock. Mate choice is one of two components of sexual selection, the other being intrasexual selection. Ideas on sexual selection were first introduced in 1871, by Charles Darwin, then expanded on by Ronald Fisher in 1915. At present, there are five sub mechanisms that explain how mate choice has evolved over time. These are direct phenotypic benefits, sensory bias, the Fisherian runaway hypothesis, indicator traits and genetic compatibility. In the majority of systems where mate choice exists, one sex tends to be competitive with their same-sex members and the other sex is choosy (meaning they are selective when it comes to picking individuals to mate with). There are direct and indirect benefits of being the selective individual. In most species, females are the choosy sex which discriminates among competitive males, but there are several examples of reversed roles (see below). It is preferable for an individual to choose a compatible mate of the same species, in order to maintain reproductive success. Other factors that can influence mate choice include pathogen stress and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).  Origins and history  Ronald Fisher in 1913 The peacock tail in flight, the classic example of a Fisherian runaway Charles Darwin first expressed his ideas on sexual selection and mate choice in his book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871. He was perplexed by the elaborate ornamentation that males of some species have, because such features appeared to be detrimental to survival and to have negative consequences for reproductive success. Darwin proposed two explanations for the existence of such traits: these traits are useful in male-male combat or they are preferred by females.Darwin, C. (1871). The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. John Murray, London. This article focuses on the latter. Darwin treated natural selection and sexual selection as two different topics, although in the 1930s biologists defined sexual selection as being a part of natural selection.Miller, Geoffrey (2000). The mating mind: how sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature, London, Heineman, (also Doubleday, ) p. 8 In 1915, Ronald Fisher wrote a paper on the evolution of female preference and secondary sexual characteristics. Fifteen years later, he expanded this theory in a book called The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection. There he described a scenario where feedback between mate preference and a trait results in elaborate characters such as the long tail of the male peacock (see Fisherian runaway). In 1948, using Drosophila as a model, Angus John Bateman presented experimental evidence that male reproductive success is limited by the number of mates obtained, while female reproductive success is limited by the number of pregnancies that she can have in her lifetime. Thus a female must be selective when choosing a mate because the quality of her offspring depends on it. Males must fight, in the form of intra-sexual competition, for the opportunity to mate because not all males will be chosen by females. This became known as Bateman's principle, and although this was a major finding that added to the work of Darwin and Fisher, it was overlooked until George C. Williams emphasised its importance in the 1960s and 1970s.Williams, G.C. (1966). Adaptation and Natural Selection. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJWilliams, G.C. (1975). Sex and evolution. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ In 1972, soon after Williams' revival of the subject, Robert L. Trivers presented his parental investment theory. Trivers defined parental investment as any investment made by the parent that benefits his or her current offspring at the cost of investment in future offspring. These investments include the costs of producing gametes as well as any other care or efforts that parents provide after birth or hatching. Reformulating Bateman's ideas, Trivers argued that the sex which exhibits less parental investment (not necessarily the male) will have to compete for mating opportunities with the sex that invests more. The differences in levels of parental investment create the condition that favours mating biases.  Direct and indirect benefits  The act of being choosy was likely selected for as a way to assess whether or not a potential partner‚Äôs contribution(s) would be capable of producing and/or maintaining the viability of an offspring. Utilizing these behaviors usually results in two types of benefits to the individual who is being choosy: * Direct benefits increase the fitness of the choosy sex through direct material advantages or resources. These benefits include but are not limited to increased territory quality, increased parental care, and protection from predators. There is much support for maintenance of mate choice by direct benefits and this approach offers the least controversial model to explain discriminate mating. * Indirect benefits increase genetic fitness for the offspring, and thereby increase the parents' inclusive fitness. When it appears that the choosy sex does not receive direct benefits from his or her mate, indirect benefits may be the payoff for being selective. These indirect benefits may include high- quality genes for their offspring (known as adaptive indirect benefits) or genes that make their offspring more attractive (known as arbitrary indirect benefits).  Mechanisms  five proposed mechanisms address the evolution of mate choice: * Direct phenotypic benefits * Sensory bias * Fisherian runaway * Indicator traits * Genetic compatibility Direct and/or indirect benefits drive the mating biases described in each mechanism. It is possible that these mechanisms co-occur, although the relative roles of each have not been evaluated adequately. = Direct phenotypic benefits = A choosy mate tends to have preferences for certain types of traits‚Äîalso known as phenotypes‚Äîwhich would benefit them to have in a potential partner. These traits must be reliable, and commutative of something that directly benefits the choosy partner in some way. Having a mating preference is advantageous in this situation because it directly affects reproductive fitness. Direct benefits are widespread and empirical studies provide evidence for this mechanism of evolution.Moller, A.P. (1994). Sexual selection and the barn swallow. Oxford University Press, Oxford. One example of a sexually selected trait with direct benefits is the bright plumage of the northern cardinal, a common backyard bird in the eastern United States. Male northern cardinals have conspicuous red feathers, while the females have a more cryptic coloration. In this example, the females are the choosy sex and will use male plumage brightness as a signal when picking a mate ‚Äî research suggests that males with brighter plumage feed their young more frequently than males with duller plumage. This increased help in caring for the young lifts some of the burden from the mother so that she can raise more offspring than she could without help. Though this particular mechanism operates on the premise that all phenotypes must communicate something that benefits the choosy mate directly, such selected phenotypes can also have additional indirect benefits for the mother by benefiting the offspring. For example, with the increased help in feeding their young seen in Northern Cardinals with more plumage-brightness, comes an increase in the overall amount of food that is likely to be given to the offspring - even if the mother has more children. Though females may choose this trait with the presumed directly advantageous aim of allowing them more time and energy to allocate to producing more offspring, it also benefits the offspring in that two parents provide food instead of one, thereby increasing the likelihood of the overall amount of food available to the offspring despite a possible increase in the amount of offspring siblings. = Sensory bias = The sensory-bias hypothesis states that the preference for a trait evolves in a non-mating context and is then exploited by the less choosy sex in order to obtain more mating opportunities. The competitive sex evolves traits that exploit a pre-existing bias that the choosy sex already possesses. This mechanism is thought to explain remarkable trait differences in closely related species because it produces a divergence in signaling systems which leads to reproductive isolation. Sensory bias has been demonstrated in guppies, freshwater fish from Trinidad and Tobago. In this mating system, female guppies prefer to mate with males with more orange body-coloration. However, outside of a mating context, both sexes prefer animate orange objects, which suggests that preference originally evolved in another context, like foraging. Orange fruits are a rare treat that fall into streams where the guppies live. The ability to find these fruits quickly is an adaptive quality that has evolved outside of a mating context. Sometime after the affinity for orange objects arose, male guppies exploited this preference by incorporating large orange spots to attract females. Another example of sensory exploitation is the case of the water mite Neumania papillator, an ambush predator which hunts copepods (small crustaceans) passing by in the water column. When hunting, N. papillator adopts a characteristic stance termed the \\"net stance\\": its holds its first four legs out into the water column, with its four hind legs resting on aquatic vegetation; this allows it to detect vibrational stimuli produced by swimming prey and to use this to orient towards and clutch at prey. During courtship, males actively search for females; if a male finds a female, he slowly circles around the female whilst trembling his first and second leg near her. Male leg-trembling causes females (who were in the \\"net stance\\") to orient towards and often to clutch the male. This does not damage the male or deter further courtship; the male then deposits spermatophores and begins to vigorously fan and jerk his fourth pair of legs over the spermatophore, generating a current of water that passes over the spermatophores and towards the female. Sperm-packet uptake by the female would sometimes follow. Heather Proctor hypothesised that the vibrations made by trembling male legs mimic the vibrations that females detect from swimming prey. This would trigger the female prey-detection responses, causing females to orient and then clutch at males, mediating courtship. If this was true and males were exploiting female predation responses, then hungry females should be more receptive to male trembling. Proctor found that unfed captive females did orient and clutch at males significantly more than fed captive females did, consistent with the sensory exploitation hypothesis. Other examples of the sensory-bias mechanism include traits in auklets, wolf spiders, and manakins. Further experimental work is required to reach a fuller understanding of the prevalence and mechanisms of sensory bias. = Fisherian runaway and sexy-son hypothesis = This creates a positive feedback loop in which a particular trait is desired by a female and present in a male, and that desire for and presence of that particular trait are then reflected in their offspring. If this mechanism is strong enough, it can lead to a type of self-reinforcing coevolution. If runaway selection is strong enough, it may incur significant costs, such as increased visibility to predators and energetic costs to maintain the trait's full expression. Hence peacocks' extravagant feathers, or any number of lek mating displays. This model does not predict a genetic benefit; rather, the reward is more mates. In a study done on great reed warblers, models based on the polygyny threshold and sexy- son hypotheses predict that females should gain evolutionary advantage in either short-term or long-term in this mating system. Although the importance of female choice was demonstrated, the study did not support the hypotheses. Other studies, such as those conducted on long-tailed widowbirds, have demonstrated the existence of female choice. Here, females chose males with long tails, and even preferred those males with experimentally lengthened tails over shortened tails and those of naturally occurring length. Such a process shows how female choice could give rise to exaggerated sexual traits through Fisherian runaway selection. = Indicator traits = Indicator traits signal good overall quality of the individual. Traits perceived as attractive must reliably indicate broad genetic quality in order for selection to favor them and for preference to evolve. This is an example of indirect genetic benefits received by the choosy sex, because mating with such individuals will result in high-quality offspring. The indicator traits hypothesis is split into three highly related subtopics: the handicap theory of sexual selection, the good genes hypothesis, and the Hamilton‚ÄìZuk hypothesis. People rate the importance of certain traits differently when referring to their own or to others' ideal long-term partners. Research suggests that women consider traits indicating genetic fitness as more important for their own partner, while prioritising traits that provide benefits to others for their sister's ideal partner. Indicator traits are condition-dependent and have associated costs. Therefore, individuals which can handle these costs well (cf. \\"I can do X [here, survive] with one hand tied behind my back\\") should be desired by the choosy sex for their superior genetic quality. This is known as the handicap theory of sexual selection. The good genes hypothesis states that the choosy sex will mate with individuals who possess traits that signify overall genetic quality. In doing so, they gain an evolutionary advantage for their offspring through indirect benefit. The Hamilton‚ÄìZuk hypothesis posits that sexual ornaments are indicators of parasite- and disease-resistance. To test this hypothesis, red jungle-fowl males were infected with a parasitic roundworm and monitored for growth and developmental changes. Female preference was also evaluated. The researchers found that parasites affected the development and final appearance of ornamental traits and that females preferred males who were not infected. This supports the idea that parasites are an important factor in sexual selection and mate choice. One of many examples of indicator traits is the condition-dependent patch of red feathers around the face and shoulders of the male house finch. This patch varies in brightness among individuals because the pigments that produce the red color (carotenoids) are limited in the environment. Thus, males who have a high-quality diet will have brighter red plumage. In a manipulation experiment, female house finches were shown to prefer males with brighter red patches. Also, males with naturally brighter patches proved better fathers and exhibited higher offspring-feeding rates than duller males. This study is heavily cited in the literature and it provides solid support for the indicator-traits hypothesis that is associated with direct benefits. = Genetic compatibility = Genetic compatibility refers to how well the genes of two parents function together in their offspring. Choosing genetically compatible mates could result in optimally fit offspring and notably affect reproductive fitness. However, the genetic compatibility model is limited to specific traits due to complex genetic interactions (e.g. major histocompatibility complex in humans and mice). The choosy sex must know their own genotype as well as the genotypes of potential mates in order to select the appropriate partner. This makes testing components of genetic compatibility difficult and controversial.  Role of major histocompatibility complex  A controversial but well-known experiment suggests that human females use body odor as an indicator of genetic compatibility. In this study, males were given a plain T-shirt to sleep in for two nights in order to provide a scent sample. College women were then asked to rate odors from several men, some with similar MHC (major histocompatibility complex) genes to their own and others with dissimilar genes. MHC genes code for receptors that identify foreign pathogens in the body so that the immune system may respond and destroy them. Since each different gene in the MHC codes for a different type of receptor, it is expected that females will benefit from mating with males who have more dissimilar MHC genes. This will ensure better resistance to parasites and disease in offspring. Researchers found that women tended to rate the odors higher if the male's genes were more dissimilar to their own. They concluded that the odors are influenced by the MHC and that they have consequences for mate choice in human populations today. Similar to the humans of the odor- rating experiment, animals also choose mates based upon genetic compatibility as determined by evaluating the body odor of their potential mate(s). Some animals, such as mice, assess a mate's genetic compatibility based on their urine odor. In an experiment studying three-spined sticklebacks, researchers found that females prefer to mate with males that share a greater diversity of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and in addition possess a MHC haplotype specific to fighting the common parasite Gyrodactylus salaris. Mates that have MHC genes different from one another will be superior when reproducing with regard to parasite resistance, body condition and reproductive success and survival. The genetic diversity of animals and life reproductive success (LRS) at the MHC level is optimal at intermediate levels rather than at its maximum, despite MHC being one of the most polymorphic genes. In a study, researchers discovered that mice heterozygous at all MHC loci were less resistant than mice homozygous at all loci to salmonella, so it appears disadvantageous to display many different MHC alleles due to the increased loss of T-cells, which aid an organism's immune system and trigger its appropriate response. MHC diversity may also correlate with MHC gene expression. As long as a heritable component exists in expression patterns, natural selection is able to act upon the trait. Therefore, gene expression for MHC genes might contribute to the natural selection processes of certain species and be in fact evolutionarily relevant. For example, in another study of three-spined sticklebacks, exposure to parasite species increased MHC class IIB expression by over 25%, proving that parasitic infection increases gene expression. MHC diversity in vertebrates may also be generated by the recombination of alleles on the MHC gene.  Sex role reversal in animals  In species where mating biases exist, females are typically the choosy sex because they provide a greater parental investment than males. However, there are some examples of sex role reversals where females must compete with each other for mating opportunities with males. Species that exhibit parental care after the birth of their offspring have the potential to overcome the sex differences in parental investment (the amount of energy that each parent contributes per offspring) and lead to a reversal in sex roles. The following are examples of male mate choice (sex role reversal) across several taxa. *Fish: Male fish typically display high levels of parental care (see pipefish, scissortail sergeant, and seahorses). This is because females will deposit their eggs in a special brooding pouch that the male possesses. She doesn't participate in parental care after this event. The male then has the burden of raising the offspring on his own which requires energy and time. Thus, males in these species must choose among competitive females for mating opportunities. Surveys across multiple species of pipefish suggest that the sex differences in the level of parental care may not be the only reason for the reversal. Mating systems (e. i. monogamy and polygamy) might also heavily influence the appearance of male mate choice. *Amphibian: Male poison-arrow frogs (Dendrobates auratus) take on a very active parenting role. Females are lured by the males to rearing sites where they deposit their eggs. The male fertilises these eggs and accepts the burden of defending and caring for the young until they are independent. Because the male contributes a higher level of parental investment, females must compete for opportunities to leave their eggs with the limited available males. *Bird: Bird species are typically biparental in care, and may also be maternal like the Guianan cock-of-the-rocks. However the reverse may also hold true. Male wattled jacanas provide all parental care after the eggs have been laid by the females. This means that the males must incubate the eggs and defend the nest for an extended period of time. Since males invest much more time and energy into the offspring, females are very competitive for the right to lay their eggs in an established nest. *Mammal: There are no confirmed cases of sex role reversed mammals but female spotted hyenas have peculiar anatomy and behaviour that has warranted much attention. Female spotted hyenas are much more aggressive than males due to their high levels of androgens during development. The increased male hormones during development contribute to an enlarged pseudopenis that is involved in mating and birth. Although the anatomical and behavioural roles differ from accepted norms, spotted hyenas are not sex role reversed because the females do not compete with each other for mates.  Speciation  For many years it has been suggested that sexual isolation caused by differences in mating behaviours is a precursor for reproductive isolation (lack of gene flow), and consequently speciation, in nature.Mayr, E. (1942). Systematics and Origin of Species, Belknap Press Mate choice behaviours are thought to be important forces that can result in speciation events because the strength of selection for attractive traits is often very strong. Speciation by this method occurs when a preference for some sexual trait shifts and produces a pre-zygotic barrier (preventing fertilisation). These processes have been difficult to test until recently with advances in genetic modelling. Speciation by sexual selection is gaining popularity in the literature with increasing theoretical and empirical studies. There is evidence of early speciation through mate preference in guppies. Guppies are located across several isolated streams in Trinidad and male colour patterns differ geographically. Female guppies have no coloration but their preference for these colour patterns also vary across locations. In a mate choice study, female guppies were shown to prefer males with colour patterns that are typical of their home stream. This preference could result in reproductive isolation if two populations came into contact again. There is a similar trend shown in two species of the wood white butterfly, L. reali and L. sinapis. Female L. sinapis controls mate choice by engaging only in conspecific mating, while males attempt to mate with either species. This female mate choice has encouraged speciation of the two wood whites. The black-throated blue warbler, a North American bird, is another example. Asymmetric recognition of local and non-local songs has been found between two populations of black-throated blue warblers in the United States, one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) and the other in the southern United States (North Carolina). Males in the northern population respond strongly to the local male songs but relatively weakly to the non-local songs of southern males. In contrast, southern males respond equally to both local and non-local songs. The fact that northern males exhibit differential recognition indicates that northern females tend not to mate with \\"heterospecific\\" males from the south; thus it is not necessary for the northern males to respond strongly to the song from a southern challenger. A barrier to gene flow exists from South to North as a result of the female choice, which can eventually lead to speciation.  Mate choice in humans  In humans, males and females differ in their strategies to acquire mates and focus on certain qualities. There are two main categories of strategies that both sexes utilize: short-term and long-term. Human mate choice depends on a variety of factors, such as ecology, demography, access to resources, rank/social standing, genes, and parasite stress. While there are a few common mating systems seen among humans, the amount of variation in mating strategies is relatively large. This is due to how humans evolved in diverse niches that were geographically and ecologically expansive. This diversity, as well as cultural practices and human consciousness, have all led to a large amount of variation in mating systems. Below are some of the overarching trends of female mate choice. = Female mate choice = Although, in humans, both males and females are selective in terms of whom they decide to mate with, as is seen in nature, females exhibit even more mate choice selection than males. However, relative to most other animals, female and male mating strategies are found to be more similar to one another than they are different. According to Bateman's principle of Lifespan Reproductive Success (LRS), human females display the least variance of the two sexes in their LRS due to their high obligatory parental investment, that is a nine-month gestational period, as well as lactation following birth in order to feed offspring so that their brain can grow to the required size. Human female sexual selection can be examined by looking at ways in which males and females are sexually dimorphic, especially in traits that serve little other evolutionary purpose. For example, male traits such as the presence of beards, overall lower voice pitch, and average greater height are thought to be sexually selected traits as they confer benefits to either the women selecting for them, or to their offspring. Experimentally, women have reported a preference for men with beards and lower voices. Female mate choice hinges on many different coinciding male traits, and the trade-off between many of these traits must be assessed. The ultimate traits most salient to female human mate choice, however, are parental investment, resource provision and the provision of good genes to offspring. Many phenotypic traits are thought to be selected for as they act as an indication of one of these three major traits. The relative importance of these traits when considering mate selection differ depending on the type of mating arrangement females engage in. Human women typically employ long-term mating strategies when choosing a mate, however they also engage in short-term mating arrangements, so their mate choice preferences change depending on the function of the type of arrangement.  Short-term mating strategies  Women do not always seek out and engage in long-term mating arrangements. This is evidenced by factors such as the evolved male tendency to seek out multiple sexual partners‚Äîa trait that could not have evolved if women were not also historically engaging in short-term arrangementsB. A. Scelza, \\"Choosy But Not Chaste: Multiple Mating in Human Females\\".2013‚Äîand by the tendency of some women to pursue affairs outside of their long-term couple pairings. David Buss outlines several hypotheses as to the function of women's short-term mate choices: * Resource hypothesis: Women may engage in short-term mating in order to gain resources that they may not be able to gain from a long-term partner, or that a long- term partner may not be able to provide consistently. These resources may be food, protection for the woman and her children from aggressive men who may capture or sexually coerce them, or status, by providing the woman with a higher social standing. Women may also benefit from having several short-term mating arrangements through paternity confusion‚Äîif the paternity of her offspring is not certain, she may be able to accrue resources from several men as a result of this uncertainty. * Genetic benefit hypothesis: Women may choose to engage in short-term mating arrangements in order to aid conception if her long-term partner is infertile, to gain superior genes to those of her long-term partner, or to acquire different genes to those of her partner and increase the genetic diversity of her offspring. This relates to what is known as the sexy son hypothesis; if a woman acquires genes from a high quality male, her offspring will likely have higher mate value, resulting in their increased reproductive success. * Mate expulsion and mate switching: Women may engage in a short-term mating arrangement in order to cause her long-term partner to end their relationship; in other words, to facilitate a break-up. Women may also use short-term mating if their current partner has depreciated in value, and they wish to 'trade-up' and find a partner that they believe has higher value. * Short-term for long-term goals: Women may use short-term sexual relationships in order to assess a mate's value as a long-term partner, or in the hopes that the short-term arrangement will result in one that is long-term.  Long-term mating strategies  While there has been evidence and research to support the existence of short term mating in women, it has nevertheless been shown that women prefer long term partners over short term mates. This preference is due to women's tendency to invest and require more energy for parental care. In long-term mating arrangements, women typically look for males who will provide a high level of parental investment, and who can provide resources to the woman or to her offspring. The provision of economic resources, or the potential to acquire many economic resources is the most obvious cue towards the ability of a man to provide resources, and women in the United States have been shown experimentally to rate the importance of their partner's financial status more highly than men. However, many other traits exist that may act as cues towards a man's ability to provide resources that have been sexually selected for in women's evolutionary history. These include older age‚Äîolder males have had more time to accrue resources‚Äîindustriousness, dependability and stability‚Äîif a woman's long-term partner is not emotionally stable or is not dependable then their provision of resources to her and her offspring are likely to be inconsistent. Additionally, the costs associated with an emotionally unstable partner such as jealousy and manipulation may outweigh the benefits associated with the resources they are able to provide. Women's mate choice is not as straightforward as selecting a mate that displays all of her desired qualities. Often, potential mates will possess some qualities that are desirable and some that are not, so women must assess the relative costs and benefits of their potential partners' traits and 'trade off'. Women's mate choices will also be constrained by the context in which they are making them, resulting in conditional mate choices. Some of the conditions that may influence female mate choice include the woman's own perceived attractiveness, the woman's personal resources, mate copying and parasite stress. = Male mate choice = Generally, it is unusual for males within a species to be the choosy sex. There are many reasons for this. In humans, following sexual reproduction, the female is obliged to endure a nine-month pregnancy and childbirth. This means that females naturally provide a greater parental investment to offspring, than males. Human males have a larger quantity of gametes than females, which are replenished at a rate of approximately 12 million per hour. Conversely, female humans are born with a fixed amount of egg cells which are not restocked over the lifespan. This provides males with a greater window of opportunity to mate and reproduce than females, hence females are usually more choosy. Despite not being the typically choosy gender, human males can be influenced by certain traits of females when making decisions about a potential mate:  Short-term mating strategies  When finding a short-term mate, males highly value women with sexual experience and physical attractiveness. Men seeking short-term sexual relationships are likely to avoid women who are interested in commitment or require investment. Examples of short-term mating strategies in males: * Multiple sexual partners: When looking for short-term sexual relationships, men may wish for there to be as little time as possible between each partner. When engaging in sexual intercourse with multiple partners, it is important to be aware that the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease may increase if contraception is not used. * Physical attractiveness: Men who are interested in a short-term sexual relationship are more likely to prioritise information about the body of potential partners, rather than their faces. When finding a female for a short-term relationship, compared with a long-term relationship, males are less likely to prioritise factors such as commitment. * Relaxation of standards: It has been reported that men are more likely to engage in a sexual relationship with women who have lower levels of intelligence, independence, honesty, generosity, athleticism, responsibility and cooperativeness, when this relationship is short-term. Men may be more accepting of lower standards, than what they usually prefer, because they are not entering a long-term relationship with this person. * Sexual experience: Many men assume that women who have engaged in sexual experiences beforehand are likely to have a higher sex drive than women who haven't. These women may also be more accessible and require less courtship.  Long-term mating strategies  Although from an evolutionary perspective women are usually the choosy sex, if a human male has the desire to reproduce he may seek certain qualities in a potential mate who could be the mother of his offspring. Humans have the ability to rely on biological signals of reproductive success and non-biological signals, such as the female's willingness to marry. Unlike many animals, humans are not able to consciously display physical changes to their body when they are ready to mate, so they have to rely on other forms of communication before engaging in a consensual relationship. Males may look for: * Commitment and marriage: A human male may be interested in mating with a female who seeks marriage. This is because he has exclusive sexual access to the female, so any offspring produced in the relationship will be genetically related to him (unless the female has sexual intercourse with another male outside of the marriage). This increases the likelihood of paternity certainty. With two married parents investing in the offspring, their chance of survival may increase; therefore the male's DNA will be passed on to the children of his offspring. Also, a male who is interested in committing to a female may be more attractive to potential mates. A male who can promise resources and future parental investment is likely to be more appealing to women than a male who is unwilling to commit to her. * Facial symmetry: Symmetrical faces have been judged to signal good general health and the ability for a woman to withstand adverse environmental factors, such as illness. * Femininity: A feminine face can be a signal of youth, which in turn signals strong reproductive value. As a woman gets older, her facial features become less feminine due to ageing. Femininity can also be linked to disease-resistance and high estrogen levels, which are factors that suggest reproductive value to a potential mate. * Physical beauty: Observable characteristics of a woman can indicate good health and the ability to reproduce, qualities which are likely to be desired by a male. This may include smooth skin, absence of lesions, muscle tone, long hair and high energy levels. * Resources: Men who are looking for a long-term partner may strive to achieve a high status or resources, such as their own home or a job promotion. This may increase their chance of attracting a desirable mate. * Waist-to-hip ratio: A waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 is an indicator of fertility, lower long-term health risks and suggests that the woman isn't already pregnant. A male is likely to desire these qualities in a mate, as it will increase the chance of survival of any offspring the couple have together. * Breasts: Men typically prefer women who have larger breasts because it is a sign of being 20‚Äì24 years of age. A woman in this age range is perceived to be more fertile, sexually mature, and reproductively healthy. Larger breasts are also an indicator of having a higher body fat percentage which secures more energy to provide nutrients to the fetus during gestation as well as increase the productivity of lactation. Although breast size is of importance to male attraction because it is very prominent, areola pigment is also found to be significant. As women age and take part in more pregnancies, their areolae become darker in pigment. Therefore, darker areolae are seen to be more attractive as they indicate that the woman is capable of successfully birthing healthy children. This is however only seen to be attractive in women with larger breasts. If a woman has breasts that are small or medium sized, a lighter areola is preferred by men because the areola lightens as a woman goes through puberty. This way, she is still seen to be fertile, she just may not be assumed to be as sexually mature and reproductively healthy as a woman with larger breasts and darker areolae. * Youth: Both young and old men are attracted to women in their twenties. Faces that appear younger are usually rated as more attractive by males. This could include faces with clear skin and a lack of wrinkles as well as whiter eyes and redder cheeks and lips A female who appears younger is likely to be appealing to mates, as it suggests that she has a higher reproductive value than alternative, older, females. As a woman passes her twentieth birthday, her reproductive value declines steadily until around the age of fifty.  Parasite stress on mate choice  The parasite-stress theory, otherwise known as pathogen stress, states that parasites or diseases, stress the development of organisms, leading to a change in the appearance of their sexually attractive traits. In societies with a high prevalence of parasites or pathogens greater evolutionary advantage is derived from selecting for physical attractiveness/good looks of their potential mates, by the members of that society, compared to members of societies with a lower prevalence of parasites or diseases who put less emphasis on physical attractiveness. It indicates that physical attractiveness serves as a method by which humans can determine resistance to parasites, as it's believed that parasites and diseases would lower the ability to portray attractive traits of those who are suffering or have suffered from a disease, and would also limit the number of high-quality pathogen-resistant mates. = Hamilton‚ÄìZuk hypothesis = The Hamilton‚ÄìZuk hypothesis (see Indicator traits) has greatly influenced research regarding human mate choice. The initial research showed that, within one species (brightly colored birds), there was greater sexual selection for males that had brighter plumage (feathers). In addition, Hamilton and Zuk showed that, between multiple species, there is greater selection for physical attributes in species under greater parasitic stress. In cultures where parasitic infection is especially high, members of that society use cues available to them to determine the physical health status of the potential mate. Regardless of the wealth or ideology, the females in areas of a society that are more at risk or have higher rates of parasites and diseases will rate masculinity as a higher priority.  Hamilton‚ÄìZuk hypothesis in humans  * Scarification: In pre-industrial societies, body markings such as tattoos or scarifications are predicted to have been a way in which individuals could attract potential mates, by indicating the reproductive quality of a person. Meaning, scars on the body could be viewed by prospective mates as evidence that a person has overcome parasites and is thus more attractive to potential mates. Research investigating this hypothesis (Singh and Bronstad 1997), found that in instances of increased pathogen prevalence, the only anatomical area with evidence of scarification in females was found on the stomach, with no evidence found for male scarification. * Masculinity: In societies where there are high levels of parasites or diseases, the females of that society, as the overall health of its members decreases, increasingly start to place more emphasis on masculinity in their mate preference. In particular, women look for increasing signs of masculinity in areas such as the voice, face and body shape of males. The face, in particular, may hold several cues for parasitic resistance and has been the subject of most attractiveness research. * Polygamy: Tropical areas were originally associated with polygynous societies and this was a result of the surrounding environment being both ecologically richer and homogenous. However, whilst tropical areas were associated with Polygamy, pathogen stress, is regarded as a better indicator of polygamy and has been positively correlated with it. Furthermore, over the course of human evolution, areas which had high levels of parasite-stress may have shifted the polygamy threshold and increased the presence of certain types of polygamy in a society. = Criticisms = Gangested and Buss (2009) say that research indicates that parasite stress may have only influenced mate choice through females searching for \\"good genes\\" which show parasite resistance, in areas which have high prevalence of parasites. John Cartwright also points out that females may be simply avoiding the transmission of parasites to themselves rather than it being them choosing males with good genes and that females look for more than just parasite-resistant genes.  MHC-correlated mate choice  Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or, in humans, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) produces proteins that are essential for immune system functioning. The genes of the MHC complex have extremely high variability, assumed to be a result of frequency-dependent parasite-driven selection and mate choice. This is believed to be so it promotes heterozygosity improving the chances of survival for the offspring. = Odor preferences = In experiments using rats, MHC-associated mate choice indicated that odor cues played a role. In humans, there is conflicting evidence about whether men and women will rate the opposite genders odor as more pleasant, if the potential mate has MHC- dissimilar antigens to them. However, women on contraceptive pills rate the odor of MHC-similar men as being more pleasant, it is unknown why women on contraceptive pills rate smell in this way. It was found that when processing MHC-similar smells were processed faster. Contrary to these findings, other studies have found that there is no correlation between attraction and odor by testing males' odor preferences on women's odors. The study concludes that there is no correlation in attraction between men and women of dissimilar HLA proteins.Probst, F., Fischbacher, U., Lobmaier, J. S., Wirthm√ºller, U., & Knoch, D. (2017). Men's preferences for women's body odours are not associated with human leucocyte antigen. Proceedings. Biological sciences, 284(1864), 20171830. Research completed on a Southern Brazilian student population resulted in similar findings that found significant differences in the attraction ratings of giving to male sweat and MHC-difference. = Facial preferences = Human facial preferences have been shown to correlate with both MHC-similarity and MHC-heterozygosity. Research into MHC-similarity with regards to facial attractiveness is limited but research so far suggests that women, when thinking of long-term relationships, will choose males who are MHC-similar. While facial asymmetry hasn't been correlated with MHC- heterozygosity, the perceived healthiness of skin appears to be. It appears to be that only MHC-heterozygosity and no other genetic markers are correlated with facial attractiveness in males and it has been shown that so far that there is no correlation that has been found in females. Slightly different from facial attractiveness, facial masculinity is not shown to correlate with MHC heterogeneity (a common measure of immunocompetence). = Criticisms = A review article published in June 2018 concluded that there is no correlation between HLA and mate choice. In addition to assessing previous studies on HLA- Mate choice analysis to identify errors in their research methods(such as small population sizes), the study collects a larger set of data and re-runs the analysis of the previous studies. By using the larger data set to conduct analysis on 30 couples of European descent, they generate findings contrary to previous studies that identified significant divergence in the mate choice with accordance to HLA genotyping. Additional studies have been conducted simultaneously on African and European populations that only show correlation of MHC divergence in European but not African populations.  Mate choice for cognitive traits  In the late 19th century, Charles Darwin proposed that cognition, or \\"intelligence,\\" was the product of two combined evolutionary forces: natural selection and sexual selection. Research on human mate choice showed that intelligence is sexually selected for, and is highly esteemed by both sexes. Some evolutionary psychologists have suggested that humans evolved large brains because the cognitive abilities associated with this size increase were successful in attracting mates, consequently increasing reproductive success: brains are metabolically costly to produce and are an honest signal of mate quality. Cognition may be functioning to attract mates in taxa extending beyond humans. If the possession of higher cognitive skills enhances a male's ability to gather resources, then females may benefit directly from choosing more intelligent males, through courtship feeding or allofeeding. Assuming cognitive skills are heritable to some degree, females may also benefit indirectly through their offspring. Additionally, cognitive ability has been shown to vary significantly, both within and between species, and could be under sexual selection as a result. Recently, researchers have started to ask to what extent individuals assess the cognitive abilities of the opposite sex when choosing a mate. In fruit flies, the absence of sexual selection was accompanied by a decline in male cognitive performance. = In non-human vertebrates = Female preference for males with enhanced cognitive ability \\"may be reflected in successful males' courtship displays, foraging performance, courtship feeding or diet-dependent morphological traits.\\" However, few are the studies that assess whether females can discriminate between males through direct observation of cognitively demanding tasks. Instead, researchers generally investigate female choice by reason of morphological traits correlated with cognitive ability. A male satin bowerbird guards its bower from rival males in the hopes of attracting females with its decorations  Birds  * Budgerigars: in this parrot species, direct observation of problem-solving skills was shown to increase male attractiveness. In a two-step experiment testing for female preference, initially less-preferred male budgerigars became preferred after females observed them solve extractive foraging problems while initially preferred males failed to problem-solve. This shift in preference suggests that females discriminate between males through direct observation of cognitively-demanding tasks. * Zebra finches: researchers conducted a problem-solving experiment similar to the one described above. However, male problem-solving performance was not found to influence female mating preferences. Instead, females had a significant preference for males with better foraging efficiency. There is no evidence that females indirectly assess male cognitive ability through morphological traits. By selecting for males with a higher foraging efficiency, females obtained direct food benefits. * Satin Bowerbirds: bowerbirds are famous because of their complex male courtship, in which they utilize decorations of certain colours. This suggests that male bowerbirds with enhanced cognitive abilities should have a selective advantage during male courtship. In a study testing problem-solving skills, male satin bowerbirds' general cognitive performance was found to correlate to mating success, rendering them more sexually attractive. However, a more recent study evaluated bowerbirds on six cognitive tasks, and found very little intercorrelation between them. In a more recent study, bowerbird performance in six cognitive tasks was positively correlated with mating success, but no general cognitive ability was found as intercorrelations between performances on each task were weak. Instead, mating success could be independently predicted via the male's performance on most tasks; this demonstrates the complexity of the link between cognitive ability and sexual selection. * Red Crossbills: an experimental study showed that female red crossbills prefer males with higher foraging efficiency. After observing two males simultaneously extracting seeds from cones, females spent more time in proximity of the faster foragers. Although females could benefit both directly and indirectly through their preference for faster foragers, the potential link between foraging efficiency and cognitive abilities was not investigated. *Mountain chickadees: in this monogamous bird species, spatial cognition is important as mountain chickadees rely on the retrieval of previously stored food caches to nourish themselves during the winter. Spatial memory has been shown to correlate with reproductive success in mountain chickadees. When females mate with males possessing enhanced spatial cognition, they laid larger clutches and fledged larger broods when compared to females mating with males possessing worse spatial cognition. Therefore, when mating with high quality males with enhanced spatial skills, females may attempt to gain indirect, genetic benefits by increasing their reproductive investment. The Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), male (above), and female (below).  Other  * Guppies: when assessing male cognitive ability via maze experiments, females preferred males that learnt two mazes at a faster rate. However, females did not directly observe males during their learning tasks. Although females could be discriminating between males by assessing orange saturation - a morphological trait weakly correlated to learning rate - females did not find males with brighter orange spots more attractive. Instead, females may use an unknown visual trait to discriminate between males and their cognitive abilities. * Meadow Voles: in this species of rodents, female preference for male spatial ability was investigated. Male spatial ability was measured using a series of water maze tests, before females were given a choice between two males. Although females did not directly observe males complete spatial-ability tasks, they preferred males with enhanced spatial skills. This preference could explain why meadow vole brain regions associated with spatial ability are sexually dimorphic: spatial ability could serve as an honest signal of male quality due to the metabolic costs associated with brain development.  Criticisms  Although there is some evidence that females assess male cognitive ability when choosing a mate, the effect that cognitive ability has on survival and mating preference remain unclear. Many questions need to be answered to be able to better appreciate the implications that cognitive traits may have in mate choice. Some discrepancies also need to be resolved. For example, in 1996, Catchpole suggested that in songbirds, females preferred males with larger song repertoires. Learned song repertoire was correlated with the size of the High Vocal Center (HVC) in the brain; females may then use song repertoire as an indicator of general cognitive ability. However, a more recent study found learned song repertoire to be an unreliable signal of cognitive ability. Rather than a general cognitive ability, male songbirds were found to have specific cognitive abilities that did not positively associate. As of 2011, more research was needed on what extent cognitive abilities determine foraging success or courtship displays, what extent behavioural courtship displays rely on learning through practice and experience, what extent cognitive abilities affect survival and mating success, and what indicator traits could be used as a signal of cognitive ability. Researchers have started to explore links between cognition and personality; some personality traits such as boldness or neophobia may be used as indicators of cognitive ability, although more evidence is required to characterize personality-cognition relationships. As of 2011, empirical evidence for the benefits, both direct and indirect, of choosing mates with enhanced cognition is weak. One possible research direction would be on the indirect benefits of mating with males with enhanced spatial cognition in mountain chickadees. Additional focus in research is needed on developmental and environmental effects on cognitive ability, as such factors have been shown to influence song learning and could therefore influence other cognitive traits.

Housed in the National Gallery, London, United Kingdom, it was painted in 1618,The painting is dated, but the \\"8\\" is \\"fragmentary\\" and uncertain. Bray, 122 shortly after he completed his apprenticeship with Pacheco. At this time, Vel√°zquez was experimenting with the potential of the bodegones, a form of genre painting set in taverns (the meaning of bodegon) or kitchens which was frequently used to relate scenes of contemporary Spain to themes and stories from the Bible. Often they contained depictions of people working with food and drink. Description and interpretation Vel√°zquez has painted the interior of a kitchen with two half-length women to the left; the one on the left appeared in his Old Woman Cooking Eggs from the same period. On the table are a number of foods, perhaps the ingredients of an Aioli (a garlic mayonnaise made to accompany fish). These have been prepared by the maid. Extremely realistic, they were probably painted from the artist's own household as they appear in other bodegones from the same time. In the background is a biblical scene, generally accepted to be the story of Martha and Mary (Luke 10:38‚Äì42). In it, Christ goes to the house of a woman named Martha. Her sister, Mary, sat at his feet and listened to him speak. Martha, on the other hand, went to \\"make all the preparations that had to be made\\".Bible quotes are from NIV translation Upset that Mary did not help her, she complained to Christ to which he responded: \\"Martha, Martha, ... you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.\\" In the painting, Christ is shown as a bearded man in a blue tunic. He gesticulates at Martha, the woman standing behind Mary, rebuking her for her frustration. The foods are shown prepared in ways typical of Spanish cookery at the time. His painstaking attention to detail show how important Vel√°zquez considered it to represent realistic scenes. The plight of Martha clearly relates to that of the maid in the foreground. She has just prepared a large amount of food and, from the redness of her creased puffy cheeks, we can see that she is also upset. To comfort her (or perhaps even to rebuke her), the elderly woman indicates the scene in the background reminding her that she can not expect to gain fulfillment from work alone. The maid, who cannot bring herself to look directly at the biblical scene and instead looks out of the painting towards us, meditates on the implications of the story, which for a theologically alert contemporary audience included the traditional superiority of the vita contemplativa (spiritual life) over the vita activa (temporal life), not that the latter was inessential. Saint Augustine had drawn this moral from the story in the 5th century, followed by countless other divines. In the Counter-Reformation the usefulness of the \\"active life\\" was somewhat upgraded by many writers to counter Lutheran assertions of the spiritual adequacy of \\"faith alone\\".Bray, 122 This is the most likely interpretation of the painting. However, scholars have given other readings of it. Some have argued over the identities of the characters, suggesting that the maid in the foreground is actually Martha herself and the lady standing in the background is just an incidental character. Another point of contention is the representation of the background. On the one hand, we may be looking at a mirror or through a hatch at the biblical scene. If so, it would imply that the whole painting, foreground and background, is set in Christ's time and would perhaps lend weight to the argument that the maid in the foreground is Martha. On the other hand, the biblical scene may just be a painting which is hung in the maid's kitchen.Still other scholars have suggested that the background image we see is the dream or vision of the maid. This is because it is elevated. Given that the bodegones usually represent images of contemporary Spain, many have thought that this is the most likely explanation. However, the National Gallery say that following cleaning and restoration in 1964, it is now clear that the smaller scene is framed by a hatch or aperture through the wall.Neil MacLaren, revised Allan Braham, The Spanish School, National Gallery Catalogues, p. 122, 1970, National Gallery, London, ; Bray, 122, & 124 note 3 The suggestion of other possibilities, especially that of the scene as a painting, may remain as an element in the meaning of the work. Joachim Beuckelaer, Christ in the House of Martha and Mary, 1565 Pieter Aertsen, Vanitas with Christ in the House of Martha and Mary, 1552 Joachim Beuckelaer, The Four Elements ‚Äì Fire, 1570 Whatever the truth, we can appreciate this as an early example of Vel√°zquez's interest in layered composition, a form also known as \\"paintings within the painting\\". He continually exploited this form throughout his career. Other examples of this are Kitchen Scene with the Supper in Emmaus (1618), Las Hilanderas (1657) and his masterpiece Las Meninas (1656). There is a second version of the painting, with significant differences, in an American collection. Flemish models The composition shows the influence of Flemish art from the previous century when Pieter Aertsen, followed by his nephew Joachim Beuckelaer, developed a type of large painting which combines a small New Testament scene in the background with a contemporary kitchen scene with sumptuous still life painting of foodstuffs. Several examples use Christ, Martha and Mary as the background scene, including The Four Elements: Fire, by Beuckelaer (1570), also in the National Gallery. There are two Aertsens with the same combination in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, and in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna a still life kitchen scene with the Martha and Mary scene again shown through a doorway, which is compared to the Vel√°zquez by MacLaren (illustrated).MacLaren, 123 Another Beuckelaer painting (illustrated) in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels, shows in the foreground a kitchen scene with still live meat and maids, and through a passage the scene with Christ and the sisters in near-grisaille. Martha is presumably the figure nearest the viewer who seems to be on her way to the kitchen. There is a third Beuckelaer in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. It is very likely that Vel√°zquez had seen engravings of these or similar works.Bray, 122; MacLaren, 123 Provenance This may be the work listed as by Vel√°zquez in an inventory of 1637 of the house of Fernando Af√°n de Ribera, duke of Alcal√° de los Gazules who died that year. It was described as \\"a kitchen where a woman is pounding garlic\\" without mention of the religious scene. It reached England probably already owned by Lt. Col. Henry Packe, who fought in the Peninsular War, and after the death of his son William in 1880 was auctioned at Christie's in 1881. It was bought by Sir William Henry Gregory who bequeathed it to the National Gallery in 1892. Notes References * Bray, Xavier, in Vel√°zquez. Eds. Dawson W.

In 1947, it was the number one song on Billboards \\"Honor Roll of Hits\\" and became a runaway pop sensation. Origin \\"Open the Door, Richard\\" began as a black vaudeville routine. Pigmeat Markham, one of several who performed the routine, attributed it to his mentor Bob Russell.Smith (2004). pp. 78, 341n. According to Markham, Russell wrote the piece for a show called Mr. Rareback, in which the comedian John Mason performed it (and presumably expanded it in improvisation). Mason, Russell, and Markham were all African-American comedians; all performed in blackface. The routine was made famous by Dusty Fletcher on stages such as the Apollo Theater in New York City and in a short film.[Archive.org] Dressed in rags, drunk, and with a ladder as his only prop, Fletcher would repeatedly plunk the ladder down stage center, try to climb it to knock on an imaginary door, then crash sprawling on the floor after a few steps while shouting, half-singing \\"Open the Door, Richard\\". After this, he would mutter a comic monologue, then try the ladder again and repeat the process, while the audience was imagining what Richard was so occupied doing. Jack McVea was responsible for the musical riff associated with the phrase \\"Open the Door, Richard\\",Smith (2004). p. 76. which became familiar to radio listeners. Fourteen different recordings of the song were made. Composition In the song, accompanied by a rhythm section and McVea's expressive tenor honking, the intoxicated, rowdy band members come home late at night, knowing Richard has the only key to the house. Knocking and repeated calls from McVea and the band members for Richard to open the door get no result. The musical refrain kicks in with the musicians singing in unison: The spoken dialogue makes humorous references to negative aspects of urban African-American life, including poverty and police brutality. The narrator explains: \\"I know he's in there, 'cause I got on the clothes.\\" He also says \\"I was on relief, but they got short of help and you had to go downtown to pick up the checks, so I gave it up.\\" Later, when a policeman tells him to come down from the ladder and begins hitting his feet, the narrator protests: \\"You act like one of them police that ain't never arrested nobody before.\\" Although the neighbors are being disturbed, McVea continues knocking as the song fades away. Charting versions *Jack McVea recorded the original \\"Open the Door, Richard\\" in October 1946 and it was released by Black & White Records.Black & White Records number 792 It entered the Billboard Best Seller chart on February 14, 1947 and lasted two weeks there, peaking at number seven. This recording is notable for being one of the first to end with a fade-out instead of the \\"cold\\" or final note ending that had previously been employed on commercial records.Robert Petway's \\"Catfish Blues\\" is believed to be the first commercial recording to employ the technique of fading out at the end of a record.

Copyright dispute The origins of the piece in a vaudeville routine led to there being several claimants to the copyright. Russell was no longer alive, but both Mason and Fletcher came forth claiming to have written it; Fletcher even claimed that he had written the tune. By the time the dust settled, the official credits read \\"Words by Dusty Fletcher and John Mason, music by Dusty Fletcher and Don Howell\\". Howell appears to have been an entirely fictional front through which someone managed to pocket some of the royalties at McVea's expense.Smith (2004). p. 81‚Äì82. Notes References * Smith, R. J.

The construction of three sanitation blocks (public toilets) in Kiambiu, a Nairobi slum with 40,000 to 50,000 residents, has reduced the use of flying toilets, and thereby reduced clogging in the drainage system and outbreaks of cholera and diarrhoea. The public toilets, constructed by the non-governmental organisation Maji na Ufanisi, based in Nairobi, require a fee to use, but have been quite popular. = Biodegradable plastic bags containing sanitising agent = A more advanced and safer mobile sanitation solution, which has a similar simplicity to flying toilets and also uses plastic bags, has been developed by the Swedish company Peepoople: their toilet bag is called the \\"Peepoo bag\\", and is a \\"personal, single-use, self-sanitizing, fully biodegradable toilet\\".Wheaton, A.

UN- HABITAT, Pakistan = Container-based sanitation = Container-based sanitation is another portable option for low-income settlements where sewerage systems are infeasible. Waste is collected in containers that can be sealed and transported for disposal. Thus users do not need to handle excreta themselves (which is a key criterion for \\"improved sanitation\\"). In one pilot study in Cap-Ha√Øtien, Haiti, container-based sanitation almost eliminated the use of flying toilets and open defecation. However, there are typically costs associated with installation and transport of these containers, which may make them a barrier to take-up among low-income communities.

Established as a center of trade in the Mamluk era and named for one of its several historic caravanserais, the bazaar district has since become one of Cairo's main attractions for tourists and Egyptians alike. It is also home to many Egyptian artisans and workshops involved in the production of traditional crafts and souvenirs. History Mamluk-era gate in Khan el-Khalili built by Sultan al-Ghuri.leftalt=300x300px = The site of Khan el-Khalili in Fatimid times (10th-12th centuries) = Cairo itself was originally founded in 969 CE as a royal city and capital for the Fatimid Caliphate, an empire which by then covered much of North Africa, parts of the Levant and Hijaz. Al-Qaid Jawhar Al-Siqilli, the general who had just conquered Egypt for the Fatimids, was ordered to construct a great palace complex to house the caliphs, their household, and the state's institutions. Two palaces were eventually completed: an eastern one (the largest of the two) and a western one, between which was an important plaza known as Bayn al- Qasrayn (\\"Between the Two Palaces\\"). The site of Khan el-Khalili today was originally the southern end of the eastern Great Fatimid Palace, as well as the location of the burial site of the Fatimid caliphs: a mausoleum known as Turbat az-Za'faraan (\\"the Saffron Tomb\\").Lev, Y. 2001. \\"Aspects of the Egyptian Society in the Fatimid Period\\".

Also located here was a lesser palace known as al-Qasr al-Nafi'i (today the site of the 19th-century Wikala of Sulayman Agha al-Silahdar). Under the Fatimids, Cairo was a palace-city which was closed to the common people and inhabited only by the Caliph's family, state officials, army regiments, and other people necessary to the operation of the regime and its city. The first attempts to open the city to merchants and other outsiders took place in the later Fatimid period, on the initiative of powerful viziers. Between 1087 and 1092, Badr al-Gamali, the vizier under Caliph al-Mustansir, undertook the task of enlarging the city and building the stone walls and gates that still partly exist today. At the same time he also opened the city to the common people, but the decision was quickly reversed. Between 1121 and 1125, al-Ma'mun al- Bata'ihi, vizier under Caliph al-Amir, undertook many reforms and construction projects, including the creation of a mint, the Dar al-Darb, and of a customs house for foreign merchants, known as the Dar al-Wikala, at a central location not far from the current site of the Madrasa of al-Ashraf Barsbay (15th century). This introduced foreign trade into the heart of the city for the first time. = The opening of Cairo and its development as an economic center (12th-14th centuries) = Cairo was only definitively opened to all people under the rule of Salah ad-Din (Saladin), who dismantled the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171 and embarked on the construction of a new fortified Citadel (the current Citadel of Cairo) further south, outside the walled city, that would house Egypt's rulers and state administration. The old Fatimid palaces in the city were opened up to redevelopment. This ended Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and started a process by which the city became an economic center inhabited by everyday Egyptians and frequented by foreign travelers. At the same time the nearby port city (and former capital) Fustat, until then the economic hub of Egypt, was in a slow decline, further paving the way for Cairo's ascendance. The main axis of Cairo was the central north- to-south street known as the Qasaba (now known as al-Muizz street), which ran between the gates of Bab al-Futuh and Bab Zuweila and passed through Bayn al- Qasrayn. Under the Ayyubids and the later Mamluks, this avenue became a privileged site for the construction of religious complexes, royal mausoleums, and commercial establishments, usually sponsored by the sultan or the highest members of the ruling class. This is also where the major souqs of Cairo developed, forming its main economic zone of international trade and commercial activity thereafter. An important factor in the development of Cairo's economic center was the growing number of waqf institutions, especially during the Mamluk period. Waqfs were charitable trusts under Islamic law which set out the function, operations, and funding sources of the many religious/civic establishments built by the ruling elite. These funding sources often included the revenues of designated shops or other commercial establishments. Among the early and important examples of this institution in Cairo's center was the complex of Sultan Qalawun (which included a madrasa, hospital, and mausoleum), built in 1284-85. A part of the complex's revenues came from a nearby qaysariyya (a bazaar or market complex made up of rows of shops) built in front of the Ayyubid-era madrasa of al-Salih (whose minaret is still visible today behind these rows of shops). This qaysariyya was thus an early prominent example of the purpose-built commercial structures erected in Cairo under the Mamluks as part of a waqf. In this case, the complex fronted the main street on one side while other shops were reached by an inner alley. = The foundation of the Khan al-Khalili during the Mamluk period (14th-15th centuries) = alt= Over many years, space along the Qasaba avenue steadily narrowed as new constructions encroached on it and open spaces disappeared. As the main street became saturated with shops and space for further development there ran out, new commercial structures were instead built further east, close to al-Azhar Mosque and to the shrine of al-Hussein, where some space was still available. Furthermore, instead of mobile market stalls that were assembled in open spaces, the city's souq areas were progressively replaced by fixed stone structures with spaces for shops. This was in part a consequence of the authorities wishing to impose greater order on commercial activities; fixed structures could be counted, taxed, and regulated more easily than makeshift market stalls that could come and go. During the Mamluk period, as the city became denser and space ran out, builders preferred to build multi- storied structures known as a khan (Arabic: ÿÆÿßŸÜ) or a wikala (Arabic: ŸàŸÉÿßŸÑÿ©), both terms for urban variants of a caravanserai (an inn for merchants). These types of buildings were centered around an inner peristyle courtyard where merchants could store their goods, with upper levels used as living quarters. The street facades of these buildings generally had spaces for shops at ground level, and in this way a commercial zone could extend around and between multiple khans. By the time of Sultan Barquq, the first Circassian (or Burji) Mamluk Sultan, in the late 14th century, Egypt had been significantly affected by the ravages of the Black Death but continued to be the center of great economic activity, with many commercial and religious buildings still being constructed at this time. During Barquq's first reign (1382-1389) his Master of the Stables (amir akhur), Jaharkas al-Khalili, demolished the Fatimid mausoleum (the Turbat az-Za'faraan) to erect a large khan at the heart of the city, which became known as Khan al-Khalili.Williams, Caroline. 2018 (7th ed.). Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press. The name later came to denote the entire district. Jaharkas reportedly disposed of the bones of the Fatimid royal family by throwing them into the rubbish hills east of the city. Later Mamluk elites also built commercial structures in the vicinity and beyond. In Sultan Qaytbay's time, one of his amirs, Yashbak min Mahdi, built the Rab' al- Badistan (an apartment complex for renters) just across from the Khan al- Khalili. Qaytbay himself built the Wikala of Sultan Qaytbay further east, near al-Azhar Mosque. By the late 15th century, the district around Khan el-Khalili had become the major center of foreign trade, including the sale of slaves and precious stones.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. 2007. Cairo of the Mamluks: A History of Architecture and its Culture. Cairo: The American University in Cairo Press. = Re-development by Sultan al-Ghuri (early 16th century) = The gate and remains of the Wikala al-Qutn (or Khan al-Fisqiya), built by Sultan left In the early 16th century, Sultan al-Ghuri, Egypt's last effective Mamluk sultan (ruled 1501-1516), modified the layout of the whole district through a major campaign of demolition and new construction. In addition to building his own religious and funerary complex and a large Wikala by his own name nearby, he demolished the original khan built by al-Khalili and rebuilt it in 1511. It became known as the Khan al-Fisqiya (\\"Khan of the Fountain\\") for centuries, until later being known as the Wikala al-Qutn (\\"Wikala of Cotton\\"). Al-Ghuri also reconfigured the adjacent area into a souq with monumental gates known as the Suq al-Nabulsi. He also tried to impose a more regular grid-like plan on the wider surrounding district. Along with the stone gates, this sort of complex resembled what in Ottoman cities was known as a bedestan: a central bazaar where the most precious goods were sold, which often had roofed streets and was protected by locked gates at night (and which was also equivalent in some ways to a qaysariyya). It's possible that this was done in imitation of similar commercial complexes in major Ottoman cities, at a time when the Ottoman Empire was the major rival of the Egyptian Mamluk state and when Turkish merchants were probably increasingly prominent in Cairo. From al- Ghuri's time, what remains today is the Suq al-Nabulsi and its two ornate stone gates, as well as the entrance facade and gate of the Wikala al-Qutn which replaced the original Khan al-Khalili. All are located along the street known as Sikkat al-Badistan. The monumental gate to the west was originally known as Bab al-Silsila, but is known today as Bab al-Badistan, while the eastern gate, across from the Wikala al-Qutn's entrance, was originally known as Bab al-Nuhhas but is also known now as Bab al-Ghuri. By the end of the Mamluk period in the early 16th century, there were 21 khans/wikalas in the district. = Later history (16th century and after) = Mamluk-era khan. From the medieval period onward, the Khan al-Khalili area was made up of several major khans/wikalas grouped together, with souq streets existing between them. From al-Ghuri's reign onward, the district became associated with Turkish merchants, and during the Ottoman period the Turkish community of Cairo was centered there. In particular, the Khan al-Fisqiya (or Wikala al- Qutn), which replaced the original Khan al-Khalili structure, was inhabited by Turkish merchants. During the Ottoman period, the prosperity of Cairo's souqs waxed and waned in accordance with local political and international economic conditions. While Cairo was no longer an imperial capital, it nonetheless played a highly important role in the trade networks of the Ottoman Empire. New khans/wikalas continued to be built. Unlike the previous Mamluk period, the construction of new commercial buildings began to shift to the west of the Qasaba avenue (al-Muizz street) ‚Äì the only area where there was still space to build. New constructions were relatively rare in the 16th century, but became more common again in the 17th century. Many old buildings were also restored, altered, or rebuilt, especially in the 18th century. While new religious complexes were rarely built (in contrast with the Mamluk period), many small mosques or prayer areas were installed inside existing khans/wikalas. By the end of the 18th century (just before Napoleon's invasion), some 39 khans/wikalas existed in the area of Khan al-Khalili and its adjoining districts. One late example of a large wikala/khan built in the heart of the Khan al-Khalili is the Wikala of Sulayman Agha al-Silahdar (or Wikala al- Silahdar), built in 1837 to replace a ruined Mamluk-era khan and still partially standing today, directly across from the Bab al-Ghuri. The district underwent significant modifications and re-developments again in the 19th and 20th centuries, alongside major developments in the urban fabric of modern Cairo to the west. Al-Muski Street, a popular market street today, was created by cutting across the urban fabric of the old city to create a street roughly perpendicular to al-Muizz street (the old Qasaba avenue), running from al- Hussein Square in the east to Midan 'Ataba ('Ataba Square) in modern downtown Cairo to the west. Among other important re-developments was the construction of about two dozen new residential blocs with ground-level shops in the eastern sector of the souq, initiated by the princess Shawikar in the late 1930s, which are now some of the areas most frequented by tourists.left Today Some shops on the edge of Midan al-Hussein (the square in front of al-Hussein Mosque).One of the alleys in the alt=The Khan el-Khalili today is occupied by local merchants and traders, and is significantly geared towards tourists where it is considered as one of the most popular souqs in the region. Shops typically sell souvenirs, antiques and jewelry, but the adjoining goldsmiths' souq, for example, is still important for locals.O'Neill, Zora et al. 2012. Lonely Planet: Egypt (11th edition). Although less widespread than in earlier days, many craftsmen' workshops continue to operate within the bazaar (usually in the courtyards or upper floors of buildings) or in the surrounding districts, manufacturing some of the products sold here or exported elsewhere. In addition to shops, there are several coffeehouses (ŸÖŸÇŸáŸâ maqha ), restaurants, and street food vendors distributed throughout the market. The coffeeshops are generally small and quite traditional, serving Arabic coffee and usually offering shisha. One of the oldest and most famous coffeehouses is El Fishawi's, established in 1773. The Khan al-Khalili proper is bounded by al-Muizz street to the west, al-Muski Street to the south, and the Mosque/shrine of al-Hussein (and its adjoining square) to the east, with its northern boundary less clear. However, in reality the souq/bazaar area spreads beyond these limits and is closely integrated into the surrounding districts. For example, al-Muski street, which runs perpendicular to al-Muizz street and cuts across the south end of Khan al-Khalili, is a major souq street frequented mostly by locals for much of its length. In addition to the important Mosque and shrine of al-Hussein, Al-Azhar University and, with it, the Al-Azhar Mosque, are also nearby. The monumental area of Bayn al-Qasrayn is also just northwest of the district, and some of its historic Islamic buildings were once maintained with the help of revenues from designated shops and commercial buildings in the area. In literature Naguib Mahfouz's novel Midaq Alley (1947) is set in an alley in Khan el- Khalili. Pivotal events of Neil Stephenson's novel The Confusion (2004), which is the second book of his The Baroque Cycle series, are set in the caravanserai within Khan el-Khalili. Terrorist attacks The market was a target of terrorism during the spate of attacks in Cairo in April 2005. The suicide attack in the market, on April 7, killed 21 people (eleven Egyptians, two French tourists, one American, and seven foreigners of unidentified origin). It was the first attack in the series; this attack drove away tourists from Egypt in general and Khan el-Khalili in particular for some time. The market was again a target of terrorism on 22 February 2009. In this attack a 17-year-old French girl was killed and 22 people were injured.

The church was across from the Saint Peter in Chains Cathedral and next to the Plum Street Temple. The original St. Paul's Episcopal Church was located at 111 East Fourth Street. The congregation was formed in 1828 by the Rev. Samuel Johnson, pastor of Christ Church. He had been unable to collect two years of back pay. He won over a sizable portion of the flock to the new church. In 1883 the church merged with St. John's Episcopal Church at Seventh and Plum Streets, which had been formed by the Rev. Nicholson in 1851. The church became the cathedral of the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Ohio. One guidebook writes of the church, \\"For decades after the completion of this stately church in 1852, elegant and fashionable Cincinnatians worshiped there.\\"Cincinnati, a Guide to the Queen City and Its Neighbors, American Guide Series, The Weisen-Hart Press, May 1943, page 185 The Rev.

Born in Fleming, Saskatchewan, he was the son of a Saskatchewan farm family and was the third generation of his family to farm in the Fleming area. Military During World War II Hammy served overseas as a Flight Lieutenant in the RCAF. Hammy had learned to fly before the war. A doctor in the Fleming community in which he grew up had a plane and taught him and several other boys how to fly. By virtue of this fact, Hammy was one of the very earliest pilots in the RCAF. Until 1944 he flew a Spitfire with real distinction. He was shot down several times, more than once in Europe and made his way back through enemy territory to fly again. He was shot down in the English Channel and spent several hours in his Mae West. By sheer luck he was picked up by an English fishing boat and was flying again in Europe a week later. He came back from the war having won several medals including the Distinguished Flying Cross. Political career Upon returning from the Second World War with his wife, the former Madeleine Anne Casey of Washington, D.C., Hammy went back to the Fleming farm originally settled by Mr. McDonald's grandfather in 1881. He didn't seek his first nomination. He was pressed by families and neighbors to let his name stand. In the provincial general election of 1948 he ran as a \\"Liberal-Progressive Conservative\\" candidate, having been nominated by a joint constituency convention of the two parties. Soon after he took a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, he devoted his political career solely to the Liberal Party and ran successfully as a Liberal Candidate for the constituency of Moosomin in the general elections of 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1964. During his career in provincial politics, Hammy McDonald rose rapidly in prominence in public life and within the Liberal Party. In 1954, he became the leader of the Liberal Party in Saskatchewan, a position which he held for five years until 1959. An article describing the career of Mr. McDonald in this context noted, \\"The swift and dazzling rise of 37-year-old Alexander Hamilton McDonald to the leadership of the Liberal Party in Saskatchewan has no parallel in Canadian political history.\\" From 1955 to 1960, he was the Leader of the Opposition. Hammy McDonald continued to hold responsible positions within the Liberal Party after his tenure as leader of the party. In the years 1964 to 1965 Hammy served as Minister of Agriculture and Deputy Premier to Premier Ross Thatcher. He resigned his seat in 1965 and later that year was appointed to the Senate of Canada representing the senatorial division of Moosomin, Saskatchewan. A Liberal, he was Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (appointed in 1968) and Government Whip in the Senate (appointed in 1970). Throughout his parliamentary career, Hammy was active in the affairs of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the International Parliamentary Union and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. He took part in community activities as a member of the Royal Canadian Legion, the United Services Institute and the Elks Lodge. Hammy McDonald died in office in 1980. His funeral ‚Äì held at the United Church in Moosomin, Saskatchewan ‚Äì was overflowing with dignitaries from Ottawa, the provinces and many, many locals from within the constituency. He was remembered with real affection and was genuinely liked by both sides of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly. His honorary pallbearers included two Members elected under the NDP banner.

Sena Nhavi (literally Sena the barber, a name often used in English sources), also known as Sain Sena,Sena, is a Hindu saint-poet (sant-kavi) of the Varkari sect dedicated to the god Vithoba.in Marathi Life Vithoba, the patron god of Sena Nhavi Sena was a barber (nhavi), a \\"caste\\" (see Bara Balutedar) and worked in the service of the king of Bandhavgarh. He gave up his profession and created devotional abhangas in praise of the god Vithoba. The Bhaktavijaya of Mahipati (1715‚Äì90), a hagiographical work on Hindu saints, devotes a chapter to the life of Sena Nhavi. It narrates how Vithoba came to the aid of Sena Nhavi. Sena Nhavi was a pious barber who worshipped Vishnu (Vithoba is considered a form of Vishnu or his avatar Krishna) daily in the morning. He was born into a low caste due to sins in a previous birth (see Reincarnation). Once, the Muslim king of Bandhavgarh called Sena to his service. The court official came with the message to Sena's house; however Sena was busy at his daily worship and instructed his wife to inform the messenger that he was not at home. This was repeated five times. A neighbour reported to the king that Sena was at home worshiping, which infuriated the king. He ordered Sena to be arrested for not coming to the palace despite royal orders and that he be bound in chains and be thrown into the river. Vithoba-Krishna went to the palace in the form of Sena to serve the king. While \\"Sena\\" massaged the king's head with oil, the king saw the reflection of the four-armed Krishna in a cup of oil, but when he looked up he saw \\"Sena\\". The perplexed king fainted. When he woke up, he requested \\"Sena\\" to wait on peril of death. However, \\"Sena\\" asked permission to go to his home once. The king rewarded \\"Sena\\" with a bag of gold coins, which \\"Sena\\" placed in his bag of equipment. Vithoba left the bag back at Sena's house and disappeared. The king lost all his senses and pined for Sena. The court official hurriedly came to fetch Sena, who felt that king had called him as he was angry with Sena. Sena arrived at the court, when the king stood up and greeted up. The king rushed towards Sena, caught Sena's feet (see PranƒÅma, a sign of respect in Indian culture) and requested him to show his four-armed form. The king brought the bowl of oil and looked at the reflection of Sena in the oil, but could see the four-armed divine form that he had experienced. The surprised Sena explained to the king that he had seen Sena's patron god, Krishna himself. The king thanked Sena as he had seen Krishna due to association with Sena. When Sena found the gold coins in his bag of equipment, he distributed the coins to the Brahmins, the priest caste. The tale ends by stating that the Muslim king turned into a devotee of Krishna and Sena Nhavi was \\"pleased\\" as his Lord, Vishnu was pleased. Two of Sena's abhangas say that he died at midday on the 12th lunar day of the dark fortnight of the Hindu month of Shravana.

He says in an abhanga that those who keep the company of evil-doers live in hell. The wicked should be kicked and disgraced. In another abhanga, he calls himself a sinner, who was tamed by passion and anger, who did not keep company with the righteous and did not meditate on God. He surrenders to God and implores him to be his saviour and rescue him from the sinful life. In another abhanga, he sings how fortunate he is to have received the grace of the Lord, who with compassion pardoned his sins. Sena detested practising austerities like inhaling smoke or meditating amidst fire, in a forest or on a mountain. He warned that someone can be a victim of deception in the forest, citing how the sage Vibhandaka was deluded by a maiden in the forest. (Vibhandaka's penance was disturbed by the celestial maiden Urvashi). Like other Varkari saints, he advocates the chanting of God's name. Sena says that God's grace is beyond discrimination of caste or quality. Sena also refers to his profession as a barber in an abhanga. He sang that we (\\"barbers\\") are skilled in the \\"art of shaving\\" and support the four caste- system (Varna (Hinduism)). They show the \\"mirror of discrimination\\", use the \\"pinches of dispassion\\", massage the head with the \\"water of tranquillity\\", cut the \\"hair of egotism\\" and the \\"nails of passion\\". An abanga in the Shrisakalsantagatha, a collection of abhangas from various saints, is dedicated to the god Shiva of the Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple. Remembrance A hagiography to Sena appears in the abhangas of the 14th century Varkari saint-poet Janabai. In one of his abhangas, the Varkari saint-poet Tukaram (1577‚Äìc.1650) uses the example of Sena Nhavi and other saints who were low in the caste hierarchy to illustrate that caste is irrelevant when compared to devotion and merit. Sena was also described as a \\"model of devotion\\" by the 15th century north-Indian saint Ravidas, which suggests that he was widely known even outside Maharashtra. A temple dedicated to the saint also exists in Hubli. Shri Sant Sena Hari Mandir in Hubli \\"Shri Sant Sena Hari Mandir\\" located in JC Nagar Hubli, was estd by Late.Shri Hari.Bhakt.Parayan (H B P) Abaji N Chatpalli in 1958. It is believed that Shri H B P Abaji Narsingh Chatpalli was enlightened & blessed by Sant Shriomani Sena (Sen Ji) Maharaj. In 1960's he visited Bandavgarh the birthplace of ‚ÄúShri Sant Sena (Sen Ji) Maharaj‚Äù which is 180 km from Jabalpur. He travelled by train till Umeria station & as there was convince he travelled the distance by walk approximately 40 km in thick forest. As he walked along with one of the attendant provide by Shri Venkatram Ethiraj, Father-In-Law Shri Vithalrao, who were at service in Railway at Katni Junction. As he walked through the thick forest he lost the way to the Samadhi of Shri Sant Sena(Sen Ji) Maharaj in thick forest were wild animals dwells specially Tigers. Suddenly he was approached by an old Sadhu who enquired him the purpose of coming to Bandavgarh forest all alone with 1 attendant. He narrated him the purpose of his visit & his eagerness to see the Samadhi of his Guru. The old sadhu asked Abaji to follow him in the thick forest & as they were approaching the Samadhi, the old sadhu visibility was becoming lessor-n-lessor to Abaji. As they came near the Samadhi the old sadhu had disappeared from the sight. Shri Abaji Chatpalli was shock & surprised. Within few steps he was near the Samadhi place of Sena (Sen Ji) Maharaj. Shri Abaji searched the old Sadhu everywhere but was not able to trace him. It is same place were nowadays Sen jayanthi his celebrated every year. Sant Sena (Sen Ji) Maharaj Idol is Installed .It called as Sant Sena (Sen Ji) Maharaj \\"Chabutra\\". Shri Abaji Narsingh Chatpalli brought the idol of Sant Sena (Sen ji) from Jaipur,Rajasthan & installed in his house in the Year 1958. Daily pooja and every Saturday bhajan is performed. As per Hindu panchang on every Shravan Vadh Dwadashi maharaj's punyathiti Utsav is celebrated. Sena (Sen Ji) maharaj Milk Abhishek is performed followed by Bhajan, kirtan & Bhandra.

Gleba is the spore-bearing inner mass of certain fungi such as the puffball or stinkhorn. The gleba is a solid mass of spores, generated within an enclosed area within the sporocarp. The continuous maturity of the sporogenous cells leave the spores behind as a powdery mass that can be easily blown away. The gleba may be sticky or it may be enclosed in a case (peridiole). It is a tissue usually found in an angiocarpous fruit-body, especially gasteromycetes. Angiocarpous fruit-bodies usually consist of fruit enclosed within a covering that does not form a part of itself; such as the filbert covered by its husk, or the acorn seated in its cupule. The presence of gleba can be found in earthballs and puffballs. The gleba consists of mycelium, and basidia and may also contain capillitium threads. Gleba found on the fruit body of species in the family Phallaceae is typically gelatinous, often fetid-smelling, and deliquescent (becoming liquid from the absorption of water). It is formed on the exterior face of the cap or the upper part of the fruit body. The foul smell helps to attract insects that help disperse the spores. Chemicals that contribute to the odor include methylmercaptan and hydrogen sulfide.Miller and Miller (1988), p. 75.

On the 1971 Monty Python album Another Monty Python Record, the song is described as one of the \\"folk songs of the Spanish Inquisition.\\" As performed by Cardinals Xim√©nez (Michael Palin), Biggles (Terry Jones), and Fang (Terry Gilliam), the lyrics are altered to \\"Knees upon the ground\\" and it closes out the album's last track. In 1980 Fozzie Bear performed this song in an episode of The Muppet Show with his mother, Emily, portraying \\"Mother Brown.\\" In her 1983 television concert special filmed at London's Dominion Theatre, Dolly Parton is shown singing the song with a group of men in a pub during the opening credits. In the 1986 movie Sweet Liberty, Michael Caine's character, Elliot James, recounts a tale of singing \\"Knees Up Mother Brown\\" on the streets of London during World War II. He runs into Winston Churchill, who joins in the singing. In the 1999 movie \\"The Talented Mr Ripley\\", Jack Davenport's character, Peter attempts to cheer up Tom (played by Matt Damon) by playing a bit of the tune on the piano. A version with ribald lyrics playing off the \\"blackout\\" regulations in WWII-era London is quoted both in Ken Follet's book Eye of the Needle (1978) and Laura Wilson's The Lover (2004). In Season5 Episode10 of Frasier, the crowd at Daphne's pub, the Fox and Whistle, requests 'Knees Up Mother Brown' from the piano player. =In association football= The song could often be heard sung on match days at the Boleyn Ground by fans of West Ham United Football Club and an unofficial (not officially run or moderated by the club) fan's internet forum takes it name from the song. It has also been adopted by fans of other football clubs for various chants, most recognisably with the words \\"Who Ate All the Pies?\\".

Dorr wrote, produced and directed some of the earliest feature-length narrative films on video, and through his advocacy and example, helped spawn the current independent media revolution, seen most typically today, online, through services such as YouTube.  Early history  After a series of public screenings of early EZTV videos at the West Hollywood Community Center, Dorr, with a group of EZTV co-founders that included Michael Masucci, Strawn Bovee, Mark Shepard, James Williams, Pat Miller, created in 1982 \\"EZTV Video Gallery\\", a 40-seat video theater, art gallery and media lab. The gallery's first premiere video was Dorr's Dorothy and Alan at Norma Place, making the gallery an instantaneous success, due in part to an article in the American Film Institute's American Film magazine, as well as in various local print and electronic press. Within two years, media attention had reached a national scale, and EZTV expanded to a 100-seat video theater, with two gallery spaces, a production studio, five video editing rooms, a music lab and a photography darkroom. EZTV continued to receive routine local press attention, through newspapers such as the LA Times, the LA Weekly, and the LA Reader, as well as various magazine, TV and radio coverage. Filmmakers who screened at EZTV included Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Altman, Chantal Ackerman, as well as artists ranging from David Hockney, Keith Haring, Yoko Ono, Bill Barminski, musicians ranging from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Black Flag and many of the pioneering digital artists exhibited, collaborated, or lectured at EZTV. Through the efforts of EZTV's Michael Masucci, and ia Kamandalu (aka Kim McKillip), often working in collaboration with digital artist Victor Acevedo, and art historian and Patric Prince, EZTV began to become a vital center for the exploration, exhibition and advocacy of the emerging new media arts. EZTV was often the meeting place for the LA chapter of SIGGRAPH, and through the efforts of LA- SIGGRAPHS Joan Collins and Coco Conn, was the first site for SIG-KIDZ, a pioneering experiment in digital art and education. Various other organizations, including the International Documentary Association, the Long Beach Museum of Art Video Annex, the Visual Music Alliance, the California Outside Music Association and the Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies guest-curated numerous exhibitions at EZTV. EZTV founder John Dorr died on January 1, 1993, from the complications of HIV/AIDS. The American Film Institute's International Film Festival was named that year in his memory, and he was eulogized in obituaries in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the LA Weekly, The Hollywood Reporter, Variety and Documentary magazine. Following Dorr's death, EZTV moved into a series of art organization-in- residency, including in Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), from 1996‚Äì2000, and Santa Monica's 18th Street Arts Center (2000‚Äìpresent).  Recent history  EZTV continued, under the direction of Michael Masucci and Kate Johnson, and continued the curatorial as well as production methodologies, premiering various new EZTV projects at venues such as the Museum of Modern Art (New York) the Institute of Contemporary Art (London) and various galleries, conferences and festivals. \\"Hacking the Timeline\\", an ongoing project concerned with the historical analysis of the new media revolution, was instituted in 2003 and has staged lectures, online screenings and gallery exhibitions of classic and emerging digital art. EZTV continues today, producing original work which has screened at the Museum of Modern Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art, the American Film Institute, Bravo, the BBC, the History Channel and various galleries and festivals. EZTV is currently an artist organization-in-residency at the 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica.

She later sailed as Bremen for Norddeutscher Lloyd. In the course of her career, she sailed for 41 years under four names and six countries' flags. Construction In 1933 Compagnie de Navigation Sud- Atlantique's modern flagship was gutted by fire after only two years in service. After a three-year dispute her underwriters agreed she was beyond economic repair and paid her owners a settlement. With the settlement, her owners ordered Pasteur as a smaller but faster replacement ship to carry passengers and freight on their South Atlantic routes. Her main competition was the German liner , owned by the Hamburg S√ºdamerikanische Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft. She was also designed to compete with a new British ship, , which Harland and Wolff was building for Royal Mail Lines. Chantiers de l'Atlantique in Saint-Nazaire began to build Pasteur began in 1938. On 15 February of that year she was launched as Pasteur after the scientist Louis Pasteur. A fire in March 1939 delayed her fitting out and she was not completed until August 1939, just before World War II broke out. Pasteur had a tonnage of 29,253 gross tons. She was 212.4 m long and 26.8 m wide. She had 11 decks and possessed extensive loading spaces. She was designed to carry 751 passengers. She could develop about 50,000 HP and speeds up to but her usual service speed was about . Her draught was 9.3 m. She had four propellers. History The outbreak of World War II delayed the deployment of Pasteur, and she was laid up in Saint-Nazaire in France. In 1940, she was commissioned to carry 200 tons of gold reserves from Brest, France to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Her official maiden voyage from Bordeaux to Buenos Aires was cancelled due to the outbreak of war. After the fall of France to Germany, she was taken over by the Great Britain government and placed under Cunard-White Star management. She was used as a troop transport and military hospital ship between Canada, South Africa, Australia and South America, and transported around 300,000 soldiers. She was sometimes called HMTS Pasteur. =World War II= Pasteur in wartime on Convoy WS19 Due to her speed, Pasteur normally made her crossings alone and unescorted rather than as part of a convoy. She made one voyage from Glasgow to Halifax with a mixed complement of troops, including officers arranging the transport of 20,000 British troops across Canada and the Pacific to Singapore in October, 1941. She also carried almost 2,000 German prisoners to prisoner of war camps in North America. In addition, she transported prisoners from Suez, Egypt to South Africa. In 1943, she visited Freetown, Cape Town, Durban, Aden and Port Tewfik, and then back to the Clyde and Halifax. She carried 10,000 troops of the British 8th Army Corps and 5,000 US 1st Army Corps troops to the battle of Alamein. Altogether, she carried 220,000 troops, and 30,000 wounded, and traveled 370,669 miles during the war. =Post-war= After the war, Pasteur was used to repatriate US and Canadian troops then returned to her owners in October 1945. Management was returned to Cie Sudatlantique in early 1946. After her return to France in 1946, she remained in French military service as troop transporter. She carried French troops to Vietnam (Vietnam War), and then to Algeria between 1954 and 1957. She was awarded France's highest honor, the Croix de Guerre. In February 1950, she made one voyage bringing 4,000 Dutch troops from Indonesia to the Netherlands. =Acquired by North German Lloyd= Pasteur was laid up at Toulon in 1956 and then at Brest in 1957. During the Suez Canal affair, the ship was commissioned again in September 1956 along with other passenger and military ships to be a troop transport. While she was docked in Port Said harbor in December 1956, the HQ General of the French troops was on board. At the end of the war, Pasteur was one of the last Allied ships to leave Port Said. She was sold to North German Lloyd for 30 million DM in September 1957. The transfer of ownership from Brest to Bremerhaven took place in September 1957. =Refit= After being acquired by North German Lloyd and renamed TS Bremen in 1957, she was extensively rebuilt at Bremer Vulkan in Bremen for approximately 65 million DM. Her size was increased to 32,336 GRT and the load-carrying capacity with 8,700 tdw. She received new boilers and four steam turbines with a maximum output of 60,000 HP giving her a maximum speed of . Economical output of 53,500 HP gave a speed of . Three 1,375 KVA generators had an output of 6,600 kilowatt. One very noticeable change was the new drop-shaped funnel, which was much more in proportion with the ship than the original tall funnel. To enhance comfort, two 4.5 m Stabilizers were fitted. In June 1959 she underwent new sea trials. =German service= Saint Thomas Island in 1968 On July 9, 1959, she was placed on the Bremerhaven ‚Äì Southampton ‚Äì Cherbourg ‚Äì New York City route. In 1960, Bremen carried approximately 28,000 passengers across the Atlantic from Europe to the USA and back again. Beginning in 1960, the Bremen was also used in cruise service to the Caribbean and South America. A bulbous bow was added during her 1965‚Äì66 refit at the repair yard of North German Lloyd. In 1970, NDL merged with Hamburg America Line to form the large shipping company, Hapag Lloyd. In September 1971 she made her final voyage from Bremen to New York for Hapag-Lloyd. In October 1971 Bremen was sold to Greek shipping company Chandris Cruises for 40 million DM after 175 Atlantic crossings and 117 cruises for NDL. The sale was completed in January, 1972. Bremen arriving in Cherbourg, early 1970s =Later career and fate= After another refit, which changed her tonnage to 23,801 tons, Regina became the flagship of Chandris Cruises and inaugurated her Mediterranean service, calling at Limassol for the first time on May 19 and taking passengers from Cyprus to Beirut, Haifa, Heraklion, Piraeus, Katakolon, Corfu, Dubrovnik and Venice. Regina continued calling at Limassol regularly every two weeks and her cruises became extremely popular. She cruised the world until 1974, when she was laid up in Piraeus because of rising fuel costs and the loss of emigration charters to Australia. Filipinas Saudi I sinking She was sold to Philippine Singapore Ports Corporation of Saudi Arabia and renamed Saudiphil I in 1977. On November 1, 1977 she arrived at Jeddah to be used as an accommodation ship for Filipino workers in Saudi Arabia. In 1980 she was sold to the Philsimport International in Hong Kong and renamed Filipinas Saudi I. While being towed by the Panamanian tug Sumatra to Taiwanese ship breakers in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, she rolled over onto her port side and sank stern first in the Indian Ocean that same year. Crew and passengers TS Bremen had a total crew complement of 545, with three hundred crew members in the hotel department. She could carry approximately 1,150 passengers, 216 in first class and 934 in tourist class. Official number and call signs Official numbers were a forerunner to IMO numbers. Pasteur had the UK official number 166305. She used the maritime call sign FNDC until 1940, and GNDW from 1940‚Äì46. Popular culture The magician duo Siegfried & Roy met on Bremen in 1960, where Siegfried worked as a steward and Roy as a page. The magic show, which they performed together on the ship for the first time, was the cornerstone of their later careers.

He attended McMaster University, where he played on the football team, the McMaster Marauders, and graduated with a degree in Economics. After a brief stint working in television programming for a major advertiser, Burke paid his own way over to Viet Nam to work as a freelance journalist and photographer covering the war. His experience reporting on the Viet Nam War was the beginning of his writing and filmmaking career and served as the background for his first novel, Laughing War which was short-listed for a Books in Canada First Novel Award. In 2018, the BBC listed the Paramount Pictures film Top Secret which Burke co-wrote as one of the top one hundred film comedies of all time. In 2012 he won the Peabody Award and was short-listed for an Academy Award for the film Under Fire: Journalists In Combat; in 2015 he was named winner of the Auteur Award by the International Press Association in Los Angeles; and in 2018 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.https://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/articles/spring-convocation-ceremonies- to-present-honorary-degrees-to-ten-distinguished-figures/ Burke lives in Santa Monica, California with his wife, Laura Morton.  Career  After Viet Nam, Burke started writing, directing and producing documentaries for CBC Television winning a number of awards in Canada for his work. Among them are a Gemini Award for Best Documentary for Connections, a multi-part undercover report on the Mafia in Canada and America, and a Genie Award for his documentary, Witnesses, filmed inside the conflict zones of Afghanistan. Other conflict zone documentaries include The Week That Paddy Died, about the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. Often Burke's work as a documentary filmmaker inspired his novels or films. His documentary The KGB Connections, resulted in his later novel, The Commissar's Report, a satirical story about Soviet and United States relations during the Cold War. Producing and directing a segment for CBS's West 57th about early black R and B legends Ruth Brown and Bo Diddley being cheated out of record royalties, led to his novel Ivory Joe, the story of a 1950s family being caught up in the turmoil of the music industry at the dawn of Rock and Roll. While still living in Canada, Burke began writing and directing theatrical films, such as John Candy's first film, The Clown Murders, and Power Play a.k.a. Coup d'Etat which starred Peter O'Toole and David Hemmings. He emigrated to California when Columbia Pictures optioned his book The Commissar's Report and brought him to Los Angeles to write the screenplay. Continuing to produce and direct documentaries - his 2012 documentary Under Fire: Journalists in Combat was short-listed for an Academy Award and won a Peabody Award in 2012 - his theatrical and cable television film career expanded in Los Angeles and includes the Emmy Award nominated film for TNT, Pirates of Silicon Valley for which he was also nominated for a DGA Award as director. In 2015 he was awarded the International Press Academy's Auteur award. He wrote a number of HBO and TNT films including The Second Civil War starring Beau Bridges (for which Bridges won an Emmy) and James Earl Jones and Denis Leary, Sugartime starring John Turturro about Chicago mafia don Sam Giancana, and an adaptation of George Orwell's Animal Farm.

Herald-Leader [Lexington]. 16 November 2006. The $25 million project, first proposed on March 19, 1984, would require the reconstruction of nearly two city blocks in the Chevy Chase district of the city, involving 12 separate properties. The development company, Progressive Companies, owned numerous properties in the district. The first nine-story structure, titled Chevy Plaza, would have included two or three floors of retail shops with residential condominiums for the remainder. It would have been located at the southwest corner of East High Street and Euclid Avenue where WDKY-TV now resides; at the time it was a KFC fast-food restaurant. The second tower would be called Chevy Chase Plaza and would have been located at the southwest corner of East High Street and South Ashland Avenue. It would feature retail shops on the ground floor and eight floors of residential condominiums. Both structures would have included a parking garage. It would be constructed in three phases, with construction beginning in late 1984 with the completion date coming in 1986. The development was unique in that it would require no public dollars or bond issues, however, it would require a zoning change for the location.

The episode features a song titled \\"The Best Day Ever\\" written by Tom Kenny and Andy Paley. A soundtrack album called SpongeBob SquarePants: The Best Day Ever was released on September 12, 2006. \\"Best Day Ever\\" pulled an average of 6.7 million viewers upon release. Plot summary At the end of the episode, SpongeBob performs a musical about his \\"Best Day Ever\\". SpongeBob's \\"Best Day Ever\\" fails to turn out as he planned when he is forced to postpone his activities to help his friends with their problems. He wants to work at the Krusty Krab, but it is condemned because of a nematode infestation; he inadvertently lures the nematodes away using his nose as a flute. Then, he plans to practice some karate with Sandy, but she is unable to because there is a leak in her treedome. SpongeBob, believing it to be a trick, fixes it accidentally by stopping the leak with one of his adhesive karate gloves (Sandy had punched him up towards where the leak was when he tried to attack her). Next, he wants to go jellyfishing with Patrick, but Patrick ends up breaking his net, so SpongeBob gives him his old net, which quickly breaks as well. SpongeBob ends up giving Patrick his new high tech net. SpongeBob waits impatiently to use the net, but decides to leave for his next planned activity. SpongeBob's final activity for the day is to go to Squidward's clarinet recital. However, once he meets up with Squidward, he says that he cannot play in the concert because the reed of his clarinet is shot. Determined not to miss out on this activity as he had done with the other ones, SpongeBob pulls out one of his teeth to replace the reed. SpongeBob attempts to enter the building, but the usher refuses to let him in unless he has a ticket. He tries various methods of sneaking in, but at last he is let in because he is on the VIP list (Mrs. Puff said his name when she found him hiding in her purse in one attempt). He gets in right as the concert ends. SpongeBob gets upset that everything has gone entirely wrong and takes the stage to give an elaborate speech about how his \\"Best Day Ever\\" has been ruined. However, Mr. Krabs, Patrick, Sandy and Squidward tell him about how he helped them with their problems and that his \\"Best Day Ever\\" was actually about them. To make it up to him, they hold a production in which SpongeBob performs his song, \\"Best Day Ever,\\" to complete his day with Patrick, Sandy, Squidward and Mr. Krabs co-starring along in it. A few hours later, SpongeBob is still singing, but his friends are tired and sleepy, and the audience has all disappeared. When Squidward asks Mr. Krabs how long they have to keep up the performance, Mr. Krabs replies, \\"Just 'til his little heart gives out, Squidward. Just 'til his little heart gives out.\\" Production Tom Kenny co-wrote the song \\"The Best Day Ever\\". \\"Best Day Ever\\" was written by Nate Cash, Tuck Tucker and Steven Banks, with Larry Leichliter serving as animation director. Cash and Tucker also functioned as storyboard directors. The episode originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on November 10, 2006. The featured song \\"The Best Day Ever\\" was composed by Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, and Andy Paley. The song was originally a part of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie soundtrack that was released on November 9, 2004. Originally, Kenny and Paley were writing the songs \\"The Best Day Ever\\" and \\"Under My Rock\\" on what would become The Best Day Ever album. However, at the same time, the team of the 2004 feature film needed two extra filler tracks for the film soundtrack. Eventually, Stephen Hillenburg, the series creator and director of the film, heard the songs and decided to put it on the film's soundtrack. Although not originally intended for the film, \\"The Best Day Ever\\" was played during the closing credits. The episode was part of the 24-hour SpongeBob marathon called \\"The Best Day Ever Marathon\\". Starting at 8 pm EDT, the event counted down the best 100 episodes of the series as chosen by viewers on Nick.com and TurboNick. Tom Ascheim, the executive vice president and general manager for Nickelodeon Television, said \\"We've received a tremendous response from almost 4 million fans who have voted online for their favorite SpongeBob episodes and we'll reward them with our biggest SpongeBob event ever.\\" The marathon led up to the premiere of this episode. The marketing method was primarily organised by Frank Tanki. Ascheim explained that Nickelodeon uses modern technology to generate interest in television shows. He believes that allowing viewers to choose the episodes shown contributes to the show's high ratings. Best Buy stores across the United States introduced a \\"Best Day Ever\\"-themed Best Buy giftcard that doubles as a DVD-ROM packed with music videos, video game previews and more. In addition, \\"Best Day Ever\\"-themed activities were held at the Nickelodeon Family Suites Hotel by Holiday Inn including a themed party called the Bikini Bottom Bash. Throughout the month of November, the hotel released a \\"Best Day Ever\\" package to its guests starting at $369. \\"Best Day Ever\\" was included in the SpongeBob SquarePants: Season 4, Vol. 2 DVD on January 9, 2007.SpongeBob SquarePants: Season Four, Volume 2. DVD. Paramount Home Entertainment, 2007. The \\"Best Day Ever\\" shorts called \\"A Random Act of SpongeBob\\" were released as a bonus feature on the DVD. The shorts are \\"Crossing the Street\\", \\"Anything for Baby\\", \\"Flowers for Sandy\\", \\"Me Money\\", and \\"Pie\\". On September 22, 2009, \\"Best Day Ever\\" was released in the SpongeBob SquarePants: The First 100 Episodes DVD, alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five.SpongeBob SquarePants: The First 100 Episodes. DVD. Paramount Home Entertainment, 2009. Ratings On Friday, November 10, 2006, an average of 4.4 million viewers tuned in between 6:30 am and 10 pm EDT to watch \\"The Best Day Ever Marathon\\".

While different prediction methodologies exist, such as genomics, proteomics, and cytomics, the most fundamental way to predict future disease is based on genetics. Although proteomics and cytomics allow for the early detection of disease, much of the time those detect biological markers that exist because a disease process has already started. However, comprehensive genetic testing (such as through the use of DNA arrays or full genome sequencing) allows for the estimation of disease risk years to decades before any disease even exists, or even whether a healthy fetus is at higher risk for developing a disease in adolescence or adulthood. Individuals who are more susceptible to disease in the future can be offered lifestyle advice or medication with the aim of preventing the predicted illness. Current genetic testing guidelines supported by the health care professionals discourage purely predictive genetic testing of minors until they are competent to understand the relevancy of genetic screening so as to allow them to participate in the decision about whether or not it is appropriate for them. Genetic screening of newborns and children in the field of predictive medicine is deemed appropriate if there is a compelling clinical reason to do so, such as the availability of prevention or treatment as a child that would prevent future disease. The goal The goal of predictive medicine is to predict the probability of future disease so that health care professionals and the patient themselves can be proactive in instituting lifestyle modifications and increased physician surveillance, such as bi-annual full body skin exams by a dermatologist or internist if their patient is found to have an increased risk of melanoma, an EKG and cardiology examination by a cardiologist if a patient is found to be at increased risk for a cardiac arrhythmia or alternating MRIs or mammograms every six months if a patient is found to be at increased risk for breast cancer. Predictive medicine is intended for both healthy individuals (\\"predictive health\\") and for those with diseases (\\"predictive medicine\\"), its purpose being to predict susceptibility to a particular disease and to predict progression and treatment response for a given disease. A number of association studies have been published in scientific literature that show associations between specific genetic variants in a person's genetic code and a specific disease. Association and correlation studies have found that a female individual with a mutation in the BRCA1 gene has a 65% cumulative risk of breast cancer. Additionally, new tests from Genetic Technologies LTD and Phenogen Sciences Inc. comparing non-coding DNA to a woman's lifetime exposure to estrogen can now determine a woman's probability of developing estrogen positive breast cancer also known as sporadic breast cancer (the most prevalent form of breast cancer). Genetic variants in the Factor V gene is associated with an increased tendency to form blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/8525697700573E1885256D6700352646 Genetics tests are expected to reach the market more quickly than new medicines. Myriad Genetics is already generating revenue from genetic tests for BRCA1 and BRCA2.http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA#r4 Aside from genetic testing, predictive medicine utilizes a wide variety of tools to predict health and disease, including assessments of exercise, nutrition, spirituality, quality of life, and so on. This integrative approach was adopted when Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology partnered to launch the Predictive Health Institute. Predictive medicine changes the paradigm of medicine from being reactive to being proactive and has the potential to significantly extend the duration of health and to decrease the incidence, prevalence and cost of diseases. Types Notable types of predictive medicine through health care professionals include: *Carrier testing: Carrier testing is done to identify people who carry one copy of a gene mutation that, when present in both copies, causes a genetic disorder. This type of testing is offered to individuals who have genetic disorder in their family history or to people in ethnic groups with increased risk of certain genetic diseases. If both parents are tested, carrier testing can provide information about a couple's risk of having a child with a genetic disorder. *Diagnostic testing: Diagnostic testing is conducted to aid in the specificity diagnosis or detection of a disease. It is often used to confirm a particular diagnosis when a certain condition is suspected based on the subject's mutations and physical symptoms. The diversity in diagnostic testing ranges from common consulting room tests such as measuring blood pressure and urine tests to more invasive protocols such as biopsies. *Newborn screening: Newborn screening is conducted just after birth to identify genetic disorders that can be treated early in life. This testing of infants for certain disorders is one of the most widespread uses of genetic screening - all US states currently test infants for phenylketonuria and congenital hypothyroidism. US state law mandates collecting a sample by pricking the heel of a newborn baby to obtain enough blood to fill a few circles on filter paper labeled with names of infant, parent, hospital, and primary physician. *Prenatal testing: Prenatal testing is used to look for diseases and conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born. This type of testing is offered for couples who have an increased risk of having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. Screening can determine the sex of the fetus. Prenatal testing can help a couple decide whether to abort the pregnancy. Like diagnostic testing, prenatal testing can be noninvasive or invasive. Non- invasive techniques include examinations of the woman's womb through ultrasonography or maternal serum screens. These non-invasive techniques can evaluate risk of a condition, but cannot determine with certainty if the fetus has a condition. More invasive prenatal methods are slightly more risky for the fetus and involve needles or probes being inserted into the placenta or chorionic villus sampling. Health benefits The future of medicine's focus may potentially shift from treating existing diseases, typically late in their progression, to preventing disease before it sets in. Predictive health and predictive medicine is based on probabilities: while it evaluates susceptibility to diseases, it is not able to predict with 100% certainty that a specific disease will occur. Unlike many preventive interventions that are directed at groups (e.g., immunization programs), predictive medicine is conducted on an individualized basis. For example, glaucoma is a monogenic disease whose early detection can allow to prevent permanent loss of vision. Predictive medicine is expected to be most effective when applied to polygenic multifactorial disease that are prevalent in industrialized countries, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. With careful usage, predictive medicine methods such as genetic screens can help diagnose inherited genetic disease caused by problems with a single gene (such as cystic fibrosis) and help early treatment. Some forms of cancer and heart disease are inherited as single-gene diseases and some people in these high- risk families may also benefit from access to genetic tests. As more and more genes associated with increased susceptibility to certain diseases are reported, predictive medicine becomes more useful. =Direct-to-consumer genetic testing= Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing enables a consumer to screen his or her own genes without having to go through a health care professional. They can be ordered without the permission of a physician. Variety in DTC tests range from those testing for mutations associated with cystic fibrosis to breast cancer alleles. DTC tests make the applicability of predictive medicine very real and accessible to consumers. Benefits of DTC testing include this accessibility, privacy of genetic information, and promotion of proactive health care. Risks of obtaining DTC testing are the lack of governmental regulation and the interpreting of genetic information without professional counseling. Limitations of predictive medicine On a protein level, structure is less conserved than sequence. Therefore, in many diseases, having the faulty gene still does not necessarily mean someone will get the disease. Common, complex diseases in the wider population are affected not only by heredity, but also by external causes such as lifestyle and environment. Therefore, genes are not perfect predictors of future health; individuals with both the high risk form of the gene and those without are all candidates to get the disease. Multiple factors in the environment, particular smoking, diet and exercise, infection, and pollution; play important roles and can be more important than genetic make-up. This makes the results and risks determined by predictive medicine more difficult to quantify. Furthermore, the potential false positives or false negatives that may arise from a predictive genetic screen can cause substantial unnecessary strain on the individual. Targeting medication to people who are genetically susceptible to a disease but do not yet show the symptoms of it can be a questionable measure. In large populations, there is concern that likely most of the people taking preventative medications would never have developed the disease anyway. Many medications carry undesirable side effects that high risk individuals must then cope with. In contrast, several populations-based prevention measures (such as encouraging healthy diets or banning tobacco advertising) carry a far lower likelihood of adverse effects and are also less expensive. Another potential downfall of commercially available genetic testing lies within the psychological impacts of accessibility to such data. For single-gene inherited diseases, counseling and the right to refuse a test (the right \\"not to know\\") have been found to be important. However, adequate individual counseling can be difficult to employ to the potentially large proportion of the population likely to be identified as at high risk of common complex disease. Some people are vulnerable to adverse psychological reactions to genetic predictions of stigmatized or feared conditions, such as cancer or mental illness. Ethics and law Predictive medicine ushers in a number of sensitive legal and ethical issues. There is a delicate balance that presides over predictive medicine and occupational health: if an employee were dismissed because he was found to be at risk of a certain chemical agent used in his workplace, would his termination be considered discrimination or an act of prevention? Several organizations believe that legislation is needed to prevent insurers and employers from using predictive genetic test results to decide who gets insurance or a job: \\"Ethical considerations, and legal, are fundamental to the whole issue of genetic testing. The consequences for individuals with regard to insurance and employment are also of the greatest importance, together with the implications for stigma and discrimination.\\"GeneWatch UK (2001), Genetic Testing in Insurance and Employment: A New Form of Discrimination. Briefing 15, June 2001. In the future, people may be required to reveal genetic predictions about their health to their employers or insurers. The grim prospect of discrimination based on a person's genetic make-up can lead to a \\"genetic underclass\\" which does not receive equal opportunity for insurance and employment. Currently in the United States, health insurers do not require applicants for coverage to undergo genetic testing. Genetic information is under the same protection of confidentiality as other sensitive health information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) when health insurers come across it. In the United States, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, signed into law by President Bush on May 21, 2008; prohibits health insurers from denying coverage or charging differentials in premiums, and bars employers from making job placement or hiring/firing decisions based on individuals' genetic predispositions.\\"Administration News  President Bush Signs Genetic Nondiscrimination Legislation Into Law,\\" Kaiser Daily Health Policy Report, Kaiser Family Foundation, May 22, 2008  See also  * Newborn screening * Full genome sequencing * Personalized medicine * Molecular imaging * Theranostics * The Singularity  References  = Citations = = Sources = * *  Further reading  * Colby, B.

The company, now owned by Global Radio (but legally still existing), founded the independent local radio stations Marcher Sound, Coast 96.3, Buzz 97.1, Champion FM 103 and Wrexham and Chester Gold, part of the Gold Network. History The company was established in 1983 after successfully acquiring a local radio licence to broadcast Marcher Sound to Wrexham, Deeside and Chester on 95.4 MHz FM/VHF (from the Wrexham-Rhos Relay) and 1260 kHz AM/Mediumwave. The station launched on 5 September 1983. After a review, the frequency changed to the more familiar 103.4 MHz. In 1989 the station opened an FM relay to cover the coastal areas of north east Wales and The Wirral on 97.1 MHz from the Moel-y-Parc transmitting station. Due to IBA rulings, the company ceased simulcasting and started broadcasting different services on each frequency. The newer 103.4 FM frequency became MFM 103.4, the 97.1 FM frequency became MFM 97.1, and the 1260 AM frequency became Marcher Gold. In 1993, the company acquired the rights to broadcast to the north Wales coast on 96.3FM, including Llandudno, Holywell and eastern Anglesey, and named the service Marcher Coast FM. In 1998, Marcher launched Champion 103 broadcasting to Anglesey and Gwynedd from the Arfon transmitting station. In 1999, MFM 97.1 was re-branded Buzz 97.1, and it moved from Moel-y-Parc to the Storeton transmitter, to specifically target listeners in The Wirral. At the same time, Marcher Coast FM was re-branded \\"Coast 96.3\\". Subsequent re-brands saw Buzz 97.1 become branded as \\"Wirral's Buzz\\", Champion FM 103 becoming simply \\"Champion\\", Coast 96.3 again becoming simply \\"Coast\\" and MFM 103.4 becoming Marcher Sound. In August 2007, 18 stations of the former Classic Gold Digital Network including Classic Gold Marcher were sold back to GCap Media, merging it with its own Capital Gold network. At this point Classic Gold Marcher was re-branded to simply \\"Wrexham and Chester Gold\\". Takeovers In 2000, the company was purchased by GWR Group, which included all of its radio assets. This followed an attempt to expand the Group further, including bidding for another licence on Merseyside, which was later secured by Dune FM. In 2005, GWR Group and Capital Radio merged to form GCap Media. Upon purchase, Marcher's four FM licences became part of The One Network, a nationwide network of independent local radio stations operated by GCap Media which syndicated much of its programming from GWR FM Bristol. The practice of programme simulcasting has been extensively used by Marcher in the past across its FM stations, and still continues this to an extent in its local programming opt-outs. In 2005 GCap announced it was to sell many of its radio businesses, including those of Marcher Radio Group. However, in March 2006 the company called off the sale.GCap Media (link defunct) Following acquisition by Global Radio, the Marcher Radio stations broadcasting on FM were rebranded as Heart in June 2009.RadioToday In 2010 three of the stations were merged into a new station, Heart North West and Wales.RadioToday In 2014 subsequent changes saw the stations become part of the Capital FM Network.

It is built in a niche at the eastern edge of the rock and most of it lies beneath the level of the hilltop, making it largely invisible. It was considered one of the major archaeological museums in Athens. Due to its limited size, the Greek government decided in the late 1980s to build a new museum. The New Acropolis Museum is now built at the foot of the Acropolis. In June 2007 the old museum closed its doors so that its antiquities could be moved to their new home, which opened on 20 June 2009.New Acropolis Museum History The museum was home to many of the Greek world's ancient relics found in and around the Acropolis of Athens since excavations started. It was designed by architect Panagis Kalkos and was constructed between 1865 and 1874. It was expanded in the 1950s to a modern design executed by Patroklos Karantinos, a Greek modernist architect.The Acropolis Museum: A Descriptive Catalogue Brouskari M.S.(1974) Commercial Bank of Greece The Acropolis Museum housed stone sculptures and bronze remainsThe Bronze Fragments of the Acropolis Bather A.G.

The building is located in the south-east corner of the Acropolis. In 1974 prime minister Konstantinos Karamanlis proposed the construction of a new museum. Initial plans were made under Melina Mercouri and the ground of the Makrygianni former military hospital and Gendarmerie barracks was chosen. The first competition was criticized and a new competition proclaimed some years later.

Amazing-Man first appeared in Amazing-Man Comics #5 (Sept. 1939). (There were no issues numbered #1-4.) During the Golden Age of Comic Books, Centaur Publications produced Amazing-Man's eponymous series, Amazing-Man Comics, which ran from issues #5‚Äì26 (Sept. 1939 ‚Äì Feb. 1942). Amazing-Man was the second superhero to have a comic book named after him, after Superman. In 1941, Centaur also included Amazing-Man in their war comic, Stars and Stripes Comics #2-6 (June ‚Äî Dec. 1941). The book was cancelled in 1942 when the company went out of business.

Each member of The Council of Seven, as the monks are known, trained him to a superhuman degree of physical and mental ability, while also giving him the ability via a chemical solution to disappear into a cloud of green mist, earning him the secondary title of the Green Mist. His new powers include super-strength, invulnerability and speed, as well as healing and telekensis. After receiving his final tests, he is sent into the world to use his skills and abilities to do good.

Aman had been sent by the Seven Cities of Heaven to assassinate Orson Randall ‚Äî the Iron Fist before the present day Danny Rand took on that mantle‚Äîin order to kill another \\"immortal weapon\\" like himself. Chasing Randall around the world, Aman would come close to killing his foe, only to yield honorably when Randall's allies would be injured. Eventually, Randall hinted that the masters of the Seven Cities had lied to Aman concerning the Tournament of the Seven Cities, in which every decade the victorious city is allowed to merge with the Earthly plane. Feeling betrayed after discovering the cities' masters had developed gateways to Earth without the knowledge of the cities' populace, Aman dropped his quest against Randall and vowed to make the city masters pay.

It attempts to explain certain mysterious phenomena reported by polar explorers by postulating that the Earth is in fact hollow, with holes at its poles. Phenomena to be explained by the Hollow Earth theory In the General Summary chapter of The Phantom of the Poles, Reed posed several questions that he claimed were explained by the Hollow Earth theory:General Summary chapter of The Phantom of the Poles at sacred-texts.com, retrieved November 16, 2006 > # Why is the earth flattened at the poles? # Why have the poles never been > reached? # Why does the sun not appear for so long in winter near the > supposed poles? # Assuming that the earth is hollow, the interior should be > warmer. # We must now resort to the compass.

Failure of Reed's theory Admiral Peary claimed to have reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. This would have invalidated Reed's premise that the poles cannot be reached. Although Peary's claim was, in its day, and continues to be controversial, on December 14, 1911, Roald Amundsen undisputedly reached the South Pole. Subsequent expeditions to and flights over the south pole have conclusively demonstrated that there are no large holes there.

Later typically aired for half an hour four nights a week at 1:30 a.m. following Late Night with David Letterman from 1988 to 1993, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien from 1993 to 2001. It was hosted by Bob Costas from 1988 to 1994, Greg Kinnear from 1994 to 1996, various guest hosts from 1996 to 2000, and finally Cynthia Garrett from 2000 until 2001. Garrett was the first African-American female ever to be given a network late-night show. Later was succeeded by Last Call with Carson Daly in 2002. Nominations and awards During Bob Costas's tenure as host, the show won the 1993 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series. It was nominated in the same category in 1992, and in the Outstanding Achievement in Graphic Design and Title Sequences category (currently called the Main Title Design category) in 1989. History =1988‚Äì1994: Bob Costas= Sportscaster Bob Costas hosted Later from 1988 until 1994. In the summer of 1988, NBC decided to again start producing original programming in the 1:30 a.m. Monday-Thursday slot following an almost 5-year period ‚Äî ever since NBC News Overnight went off the air in late fall 1983 ‚Äî during which the time slot had been vacant and local affiliates either signed off for the night or programmed the airtime themselves. Created and produced by Dick Ebersol, the new program was something of a break from the typical American late night TV talk show format of the era; featuring Costas and a single guest having an intense conversation for the entire half hour ‚Äî without a house band, opening monologue, studio audience or guest musical performances, close to what Tom Snyder had done on Tomorrow in a similar timeslot during the 1970s and would again do on The Late Late Show in the mid-1990s. By the time he got hired for NBC's new late-night talk show, 36-year-old Costas had been with NBC Sports for almost a decade, most prominently as the studio host of their NFL coverage ‚Äî occasionally getting to branch out into longer form interviews with various athletes. Additionally, since 1983, he had been making regular appearances on Late Night with David Letterman as part of the show's comedy pieces ‚Äî mostly as a straight man sportscaster providing live commentary of absurd 'events' such as elevator or fire extinguisher races in the RCA Building and search for the Late Night baby. According to Costas, it was in fact Letterman, an admirer of his sports interviews, who had something to do with Costas getting what turned out to be the Later job by suggesting that the sportscaster could do a late night talk show to senior vice president of NBC Sports Dick Ebersol who had influence beyond NBC Sports owing to a close friendship with the president of NBC's entertainment division Brandon Tartikoff. Later was taped in New York City at GE Building's famous Studio 8H, and occasionally in Los Angeles. Costas interviewed a single guest for 45 minutes to an hour in real time before turning the material over to editors, who condensed it down to 22 minutes plus commercials. On several occasions, an interview with a particularly noteworthy guest (examples include Paul McCartney, David Crosby, Bob Seger, Don Rickles, Jerry Lewis, David Letterman, Garry Shandling, Siskel & Ebert, Mel Brooks, Roger Corman, Robert Duvall and Martin Scorsese) was shown over multiple nights. These in-depth discussions won Costas much praise for his interviewing skills. Costas resided in St. Louis all through his run on Later, flying to New York City once per week to shoot a week worth of shows, recording all four in a single day. Guests during the first week on air were Linda Ellerbee, Gary Coleman and Billy Crystal. Only weeks into its run, Later was preempted for NBC's presentation of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul with Costas hosting the network's Olympic late-night coverage. Later occasionally had guest hosts substituting for Costas, including Pat Sajak, Katie Couric, Chris Connelly, Matt Lauer and Tom Snyder. Snyder's 22 March 1991 interview with thirty-seven-year-old Howard Stern who came on Later to plug his Crucified by the FCC CD boxset was particularly notable since the host and the guest, while mostly remaining cordial and civil, aggressively and sarcastically expressed dislike for each other throughout the interview, often engaging in heated, testy, and uncomfortable exchanges. Though the two met face to face for the first (and last) time on this occasion, former NBC late night host Snyder now doing a nightly radio show for ABC Radio and syndicated morning shock jock Stern heard in the New York City, Philadelphia, and D.C. radio markets had a prior record of mutual attack on their respective media outlets that continued after the show. On Thursday, 3 October 1991, Later's hour-long three-year anniversary special aired at 11:30pm on NBC, a time slot normally reserved for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In late January 1993, to celebrate its fifth year on the air, Later aired a special anniversary show from Los Angeles on the Saturday before that year's Super Bowl being held in Pasadena with Costas pulling double duty that weekend on Later as well as on NBC Sports' Super Bowl coverage. During one of his last shows, Costas said personal considerations led to his decision to leave Later. He did not want to move his family to New York and felt worn out by the workload consisting of his obligations with NBC Sports and his duties on Later. Costas' last episode, an hour-long special, aired Friday, Feb. 25, 1994. In January 2019, after leaving NBC, he expressed interest in reviving Later on another network.https://nypost.com/2019/01/15/bob-costas-and-nbc-are- quietly-and-officially-broken-up/ =1994‚Äì1996: Greg Kinnear= Following Costas's departure in February 1994, Later reverted to a conventional late night talk show format, with young television personality and aspiring actor Greg Kinnear becoming the new host. His first episode aired Monday, Feb. 28, 1994. The show relocated to Los Angeles, where it was taped at NBC Studios in Burbank, California with an opening monologue, studio audience, and comedy bits as well as quick one-segment interview with contemporary TV and movie personalities plugging their projects. Simultaneous to his duties on Later, Kinnear continued hosting Talk Soup on E! as well as fostering his budding acting career. Sometime during 1995, he quit Talk Soup and in December of the same year the movie Sabrina opened, a big budget motion picture remake in which Kinnear had a notable supporting role. The favorable exposure led to more movie offers for the 32-year-old actor and it wasn't long before he quit Later. =1996‚Äì2000: Guest hosts= Friday Night host Rita Sever was the most consistent guest host during this period of time. Other guest hosts came from just about any facet of public life in the United States, including the supermodel Cindy Crawford and actress/comedienne Lynne Koplitz. = 2000‚Äì2001: Cynthia Garrett = In December 1999, NBC issued a press release announcing former VH1 VJ Cynthia Garrett, who had guest hosted twice that month, as its permanent host saying: \\"The show attracted its largest audience in nine months in the key adult 18-49 demographic.\\" Garrett debuted on January 31, 2000, interviewing Lenny Kravitz. Returning to the show's initial Bob Costas-led format, Garrett interviewed guests such as Laurence Fishburne, Joe Montana, Angela Bassett, Leah Remini and Magic Johnson. The program was canceled in December 2000, with the final episode airing in January 2001. Garrett became an on-air personality for the then-new TV Guide Channel. Around this time, NBC began to negotiate with Carson Daly to take over the Later timeslot, but this would not happen for well over a year. =2001‚Äì2002: Later presents SCTV= Following the end of Later, the time slot was used for time- and content- edited repeats of the Canadian sketch comedy SCTV, a show which had previously aired on NBC from 1981 through 1983. A new voice-over introduction by Rita Sever presented the program as \\"Later presents...SCTV\\", but the series was otherwise identical to the syndicated SCTV repeats that had been airing for years. In 2001, NBC announced that MTV VJ Carson Daly would be the new host of Later. However, when Daly took over the time slot in January 2002, the Later name was retired, and the show went on the air as Last Call with Carson Daly, a show that would run in several iterations until September 2019, when it was replaced with A Little Late with Lilly Singh.

Horne and starring Laurel and Hardy. It was produced by Hal Roach. Plot Sailors Laurel and Hardy disembark and book in a sleazy hotel. The owner Mugsie Long intends to marry a young girl --- the hotel's maid --- against her wishes, but Stan and Ollie come to her rescue. Mugsie is tough and intimidating --- billiard balls thrown at his head bounce off with no effect --- but the pair finally trap his neck in an extending table while the girl escapes. After fleeing the hotel, the boys find out they've left their money in their room, but an old pal of Ollie's offers $50 if Ollie will fight in a boxing ring that night. Ollie agrees, but predictably makes Stan the fighter and himself the manager. Stan enters the ring and discovers that his opponent is Mugsie himself. Knowing how tough Mugsie is, Ollie makes a seemingly wise bet with a drunk on Mugsie to win. Meanwhile, Mugsie is enraged at seeing Stan again, and loads his glove with metal before the fight begins. However, during the course of the fight, Mugsie and Stan accidentally switch gloves, causing Mugsie to comically run away from Stan knowing he has the loaded glove. Stan, who doesn't realize the glove is loaded, wins the fight when Mugsie tries to pull the loaded glove off Stan's hand and winds up knocking himself out. Mugsie's second calls a policeman and tells him Stan had been fighting with a loaded glove. Ollie is forced to give the drunk the money they received for entering the fight, and explains to Stan, \\"I bet on you to lose and you double-crossed me!\\" Stan, enraged at his own buddy and manager betting against him, draws his fist back to punch Ollie, and accidentally knocks out the policeman investigating the loaded glove still on Stan's hand.

This term was coined around 2000 in EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute) to denote the importance of biological text information. Similar terms that have been less frequently used are literaturome and textome. By approximate analogy to widely used terms like genome, metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome, this -ome would properly refer to the literature of a specified or contextually implied field, hence: biological bibliome, political bibliome, etc. However the term has not (yet) been applied outside the biological and medical sciences so it currently by default applies just to the biomedical fields. It would make little sense to apply it to a particular body of texts such as MEDLINE, despite a natural analogy that might seem to suggest this: the terms genome, proteome, channelome, metabolome, and transcriptome all usually assume a specific organism or cell set and (except for genome) a specific time point. The reason following this analogy would make little sense is that there is already an established term for this purpose, corpus.

Voice scripting protocols like VoiceXML and CCXML are also inspiring sources, and in some cases need to be integrated with what media servers will need to operate in the real world. MSCML enables enhanced conference control functions such as muting individual callers or legs in a multi-party conference call. Other control functionality enabled by MSCML includes the ability to increase or decrease the volume on a leg or on the call and the capability to create sub-conferences. MSCML also addresses other feature requirements for large-scale conferencing applications, such as sizing and resizing of a conference. SIP and MSCML are used to develop and deploy services within the IP applications and services architecture. This network topology consists of application servers and media servers which work together in a client-server relationship, with application servers (clients) providing the service logic for each specific application and the media server (server) acting as a shared media processing resource for the applications. The media server operates as an independent entity, managing and allocating its processing resources to match the requirements of each application. Its primary role is to handle requests from the application server for performing media processing on packetized media streams.

According to the Old English poem Widsith before Eadgils became king the Myrgings had been at war with a tribe called the Mofdings under the previous king Meaca who was probably killed in battle fighting against them resulting in their defeat and forcing the Myrgings to retreat back to the Eider where Eadgils probably became king, Following Meaca's death Eadgils became a powerful Myrging king by defeating the Mofdings and plundering the Angles and their lands as he was determined to rule over them, However the Angles forced the Myrgings to flight. No other source remembers the Myrgings as they were probably assimilated to the surrounding Angles and only leaving the slightest of traces, This Eadgils has sometimes been confused with the Swedish king Eadgils who lived almost a century later. Eadgils was at war with the Angles and plundered their lands, He slew Frowinus, the governor of Schleswig. Frowinu's sons Ket and Wig avenged their father's death by killing Eadgils, but did so by fighting two against one. Because of this Offa decided to fight two Myrging princes, probably the sons of Eadgils, and slew them. After this, the Myrgings were successfully conquered by Offa.

They specialise in protest songs, and have supported many environmental campaigns across the world. History Seize The Day were founded in 1997 by singer- songwriters Theo Simon and Shannon Smy, in order to celebrate and inspire the country's environmental movement. The band has grown to include between five and eight members. The band have played annually at the Glastonbury Festival, including the main stage in 1998, as well as The Green Gathering every year since the band formed. They have also played at many other Folk Festivals, including Cambridge, Towersey, Sidmouth, Ely and Stainsby. They also regularly perform at other festivals including Buddhafield, Off Grid, and Permaculture Gatherings. Because of their radical lyrics and songs, and their commitment to acting on their beliefs, they have also developed a wide following among grass-roots campaigners, playing at a large number of benefit gigs and protest meetings. Recently the band have elected not to fly, due to their concerns over the environmental impact of air travel. Style Although they have recorded several albums, the band is mainly known for its live work, which has gained them popularity on the folk and alternative scene. The music is enhanced by compelling vocal arrangements, with powerful lyrics addressing environmental and political themes. They are able to perform acoustically and outside with a solar-powered PA. Campaigning Seize The day's political and environmental commitment has sometimes led to controversy. In 2003 they won the Audience poll for the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music, but were denied the award (perhaps because of their stance on the war in Iraq) - and responded by protesting naked on the stage. Their music was featured however on the international CD Peace Not War, alongside Ani Difranco and Billy Bragg. Their international appeal was reflected in the BBC World Service listeners selection of Shannon as \\"pick of the week\\" in 2000, following her appearance on Everywoman. Before making the decision to no longer fly the band spent three months on a musical campaign tour promoting sustainable agriculture in India, visiting rural villages in Andhra Pradesh, helping to support farmers, and performing to policy makers. The band spent one Christmas supporting the Peace Movement in the West Bank, and helping to facilitate Palestinian access to basic services such as water. Seize The Day‚Äôs American tours have included a range of concerts supporting the Small and Family Farmers Alliance, as well as fund raising for various environmental campaigning organisations. They also performed as the headline band at the \\"Rally for Rural America\\" in Washington, D.C., the Biodevastation Conference in Boston, the May Day March in San Francisco and dozens of venues up and down the east and west coasts of the US and Canada. They also played to 5000 people at The KeyArena in Seattle on the eve of the WTO meeting. Radio and television Seize The Day have featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme Singing in the Wilderness, hosted by Tom Robinson. Lead singer Shannon Smy was subsequently interviewed for BBC World Service's Everywoman, reaching 45 million listeners worldwide. Smy's appearance was also selected for the Pick of the World programme, and Theo Simon was a guest on BBC Two‚Äôs Newsnight.

The of SR 34 that lie within the state serve as a minor highway. None of the highway is listed on the National Highway System. Various sections are rural two-lane highway and urban four-lane highway. The highway passes through residential and commercial properties. The highway was first signed in 1923 and was much longer than it is today, going from the Indiana state line, west of Edon, to SR 101, east of Fremont. Most of the route was replaced by US 6 or SR 412\\\\. SR 34 was extended in the late 1950s, when US 6 was rerouted onto a more southerly route near Bryan. Route description St. Joseph's Church in Blakeslee SR 34 heads east from the Indiana state line towards Edon, as a two- lane highway passing through farmland with a few houses. The road enters Edon and passes through residential properties. In the center of the town is a four-way stop with SR 49\\\\. East of SR 49 the route leaves the town and crosses the Indiana Northeastern Railroad track. The highway has east passing through farmland with a few houses, before making a sharp curve south. The road heads due south towards Blakeslee. In Blakeslee the route passes under a Norfolk Southern Railroad track and the highway turns east-southeast towards Bryan. On the way to Bryan the highway makes a few curves and crosses over the St. Joseph River, before entering Bryan. The road enters Bryan heading due south and crossing over more Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks, before turning due east concurrent with High Street. The street heads towards downtown Bryan, as a four-lane undivided highway passing through commercial and residential properties. In downtown the route has a traffic light with U.S. Route 127 (US 127) and SR 15 at the northeast corner of the Williams County Court House. This intersection is the western end of SR 2 concurrency with SR 2 joining from the south. The highway leaves downtown Bryan heading east through residential and commercial properties. At Union Street, High Street narrow to a two-lane highway and enters a mostly commercial area. East of Bryan the road heads east, passing through mostly farmland with a few houses and some woodlands. The road becomes very curvy, before turning southeast. In eastern Williams County the highway crosses over the Tiffin River and has an intersection with SR 191\\\\. This intersection is the eastern end of the SR 2 concurrency with SR 2 heading north concurrent with SR 191\\\\. The road continues southeast, passing through farmland and entering Henry County. In western Henry County the route has a traffic signal at SR 66\\\\. The eastern terminus is at an intersection with US 6, northwest of Ridgeville Corners. No part of SR 34 is included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) like all other state roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2008, ODOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 990 vehicles used the highway daily on a section through Blakeslee. The peak traffic volumes were 8,360 vehicles AADT along a section of SR 34 on the west side of Bryan. History The route was signed in 1923 from the Indiana state line, west of Edon, east to SR 101. In 1932, US 6 was signed in Ohio and replace most of SR 34 east of Bryan to Fremont, with SR 12, now SR 412, replacing the rest the route to an intersection with SR 101. In 1958, US 6 was moved onto what was formerly SR 384, passing just south of Bryan. With US 6 removed, SR 34 was moved onto the old route of US 6 east of Bryan to its current intersection with US 6. Since 1958 the only work on the route has been maintenance.

Minnesela was founded in 1882 and was located three miles southeast of present-day Belle Fourche. The railroad's decision to bypass Minnesela and to continue on to Belle Fourche in 1890 caused the town to be abandoned by 1901.  History  = Settlement and founding = In 1876, American pioneer John T. \\"Buckskin Johnny\\" Spaulding and his brother-in-law Thomas J. Davis built the first home, a two-story log cabin, two and a half miles southeast of present-day Belle Fourche. It was constructed from logs felled in the Black Hills between Crook City and Deadwood; the logs were then hauled to the site. The house was made up of a living room, parlor, kitchen, children's room, and a main bedroom. This cabin housed Spaulding; Davis; Davis's wife, Lucinda; and the Davis' children. During the next five years, homesteaders gradually settled the area. After Spaulding left, his cabin was used by many settlers in the area until the late 1930s. Minnesela was plotted in 1881 by D. T. Harrison and Azby Chouteau. In early 1882, after the population of the area reached 100, the community decided to build the town on the east bank of Redwater River, at a location one-half mile south of Spaulding's cabin. The founders of Minnesela standing on the balcony of the Minnesela Hotel in 1889. =Growth= In 1882, Minnesela became the county seat of Butte County. The town flourished, and by 1883, its residents had built a post office, two saloons, about six stores, Commercial Club, school, Methodist church, bank, hotel, and flour mill. The school was built from the Minnesela jail. Minnesela had two newspapers, one of which was known as the Butte County Star. The cemetery, which has 102 interments, was created in 1887 to the north of the town. Because it was then the only town on the prairies just north of the Black Hills, Minnesela was an ideal place for a trade center. Minneselans called their town \\"the future metropolis of the Black Hills and the midland city of the United States\\" and the \\"coming Chicago of the Midwest.\\" = Decline and disband = Seth Bullock and his business partner, Sol Star, moved into the area and built the SB Ranch at the confluence of the Redwater River and the Belle Fourche River in 1879. This ranch grew to become famous throughout the West for its thoroughbred trotting horse breeding, and in the spring of 1881, Bullock planted the first crop of alfalfa in the Western United States. In 1884, the Marquis de Mores created a stage line in order to connect Deadwood, South Dakota to the Northern Pacific Railroad, which passed through Medora, North Dakota. A few shacks, a stage barn, and a saloon were set up on the SB Ranch. The stage line failed after only a few trips, and the line shut down; however, the saloon remained open, to the disapproval of many Minneselan women. The last building on the De Mores station site burned down in 1888. Minnesela experienced severe winter weather; the snow sometimes covered windows 2-stories high. In 1886, a hot, dry summer and a powerful winter blizzard destroyed farmers' crops and ranchers' livestock. By 1887, the Minneselans had turned to the Fremont, Elkhorn, and Missouri Valley Railroad for expansion. In 1890, the railroad began laying track north of Whitewood, South Dakota. Minnesela expanded its town site in preparation for the arrival of the railroad, with new land ready for purchase. The new board of trade (established before the Chamber of Commerce) asked Bullock to negotiate with the railroad company on their behalf, to which he agreed. At the meeting, railroad owners said that they wanted donated land and preferred an 80-acre spot south of Minnesela that was open for filing. Resident Douglas Sayre left the meeting and went to Rapid City's land office on his fastest horse. After the meeting, railway right-of-way man T. G. Carter took a locomotive from Whitewood to Rapid City. Carter met Sayre in the land office and offered Sayre $500 for the land; instead, Sayre laughed and said that his price for the \\"Golden 80\\" was climbing over $5,000. By the time Sayre raised it to $10,000, there were no takers. Seth Bullock donated a large amount of land on his ranch to allow the train depot to be built on the former site of the De Mores Station. On August 14, 1890, the last rail between Whitewood and the Middle Creek stockyards was laid, and the railroad began shipping livestock. Belle Fourche was founded on May 1, 1891. Bullock offered free land to Minneselans and their businesses. Despite the hostility between the two towns' residents, most people accepted, and Belle Fourche grew rapidly. One of the first buildings to move was the Butte County Bank. In 1894, the two towns competed for the county seat. Belle Fourche offered to build a courthouse for free and collected over 100 outside voters. They kept some voters in the town by giving them work; others were kept in town by the saloons. Through this strategy, Belle Fourche won the election for the county seat. In celebration, a group of cowboys rode to Minnesela and stole the county books. The Belle Fourche sheriff returned the books until an official transfer could be made. By 1901, Minnesela was a ghost town. The former site of the post office and store. = Later history and today = In 1957, the town's flour mill was torn down. In 1960, Spaulding's cabin was donated to the Tri-State Museum in Belle Fourche. The house was then remodeled by the Lions Club, and in 2006, the house was moved to the Tri-State Museum. The house was again remodeled in the spring of 2007, and the cabin opened to the public on June 14, 2007. The Minnesela Hotel is the only building still standing. The townsite is now a small farming community just outside Belle Fourche. In 1999, a sign was placed by the Butte County Historical Society on the former spot of the Minneselan post office and store.  Geography  Minnesela is located on the Great Plains, approximately three miles southeast of Belle Fourche, Butte County, South Dakota. It is about 10 miles north of the Black Hills. The town was located on the banks of the Lower Redwater River. The present marker is slightly to the east of the banks of the river.  Demographics  In 1882, about 100 people were living in Minnesela. The town began its steady population decline in 1891, and by 1901, the town was abandoned.

Herald-Leader [Lexington]. 16 November 2006. The $100.5 million project would have included the 41-level skyscraper and a retail shopping center. It is today home to the main branch of the Lexington Public Library, Park Plaza Apartments and Phoenix Park. History Wallace Wilkinson, who later became Governor of Kentucky, had proposed the World Coal Center for Lexington in the early 1980s. In 1981, Wilkinson purchased the Phoenix Hotel and demolished it in hopes that the 41-floor skyscraper would be constructed on the site. The property would remain a rubble-filled site until 1984, when Wilkinson proposed that a temporary park be constructed over what had become known as \\"Lake Wilkinson.\\" He proposed benches with tables, a \\"meandering path\\" constructed of crushed brick and stone from the old hotel, three entrance plazas, a small amphitheater, several shade trees, and fountains that would replace the demolished hotel until a suitable structure could be erected in its place. This announcement came before the finals for the NCAA basketball tournament that was to be held in Rupp Arena in 1985. The World Coal Center by this time had been reduced to a 25 floor high-rise. It was joked that the park be named after the Phoenix Hotel since it will \\"rise from the rubble\\" that had covered the property. Ironically, the park that did replace part of the old hotel site was named Phoenix Park.

According to the General Urbanistic Plan (GUP) of Belgrade, it will be formed in Belgrade's municipality of Palilula.  Location  The area designated for the future island is located in the Banat section of the municipality of Palilula between the Danube and the Jojkiƒáev Dunavac canal, ending section of the Vizelj stream in Panƒçevaƒçki Rit (Jojkiƒá's Little Danube, named so after the former mayor of Belgrade, ƒêurica Jojkiƒá) on the east, and the weekend settlement of Crvenka on the west. At present, the designated area has two major sections: eastern and smaller one is a small island of Ko≈æara on the Jojkiƒáev Dunavac's mouth into the Danube, and western and much larger floodplain between the Danube and the embankment which protects the inner areas of Panƒçevaƒçki Rit (Krnjaƒça, Crvenka). The area is floodable, thickly forested, uninhabited (that is, without permanent population) and densely crisscrossed by the elongated bogs and slow streams.  Name  Except for the island of Ko≈æara, major part of the area has no name of its own though it used to be called Crvenka, just like the modern weekend settlement. City government proposed temporary name of ƒçaplja, which is Serbian for heron. It is decided that each project, proposed to the city government for the future island, should also propose a name for it.  Formation  The projected area of the island is , which is two times larger than Ada Ciganlija and three times larger than Veliko Ratno Ostrvo. The formation should be achieved by digging a canal along the existing embankment, which would turn the wetland into a real island. Though some articles already nicknamed it the twin island of Veliko Ratno Ostrvo (which is away), ƒåaplja is going to be almost three times larger in area, differently shaped, it will not have any land of bridge connection to each other, and unlike Veliko Ratno Ostrvo which is protected by the law and any human interference is prohibited, future island is projected as the major tourist and recreational attraction. It is intended to keep and protect the existing autochthonous vegetation, wetland and marshy ecosystems. Also, the forests should be repopulated by the natural species of trees that grow in these areas, and even the existing poplar plantations will be replaced by the native sorts of trees. It is also projected to keep the vegetation in the widest possible range, so the present view of the left bank of the Danube should stay intact. When the construction of the leisure facilities is all done, it is expected not to cover more than a 40% of the island, while 60% will remain intact natural environment.  Function  The recreational complex is envisioned for the use during entire year. The canal which will separate it from the embankment will be navigable and used for nautical sports. Across the embankment, a large golf terrains are projected, so as a marina which will connect the island to the ports in Belgrade ( away) and Zemun. Also, a road connection to the road of Zrenjaninski put will be constructed. As the future island is still just a vision of the city government, and no accepted plan or a project for it does exist, it is only revealed that facilities on the island will comprise an aqua park.  Current status  City government of the Democratic Party, apart from envisioning it in 2003, didn't do anything to push the project. After the 2013 change, when Serbian Progressive Party took over the Belgrade's government, they completely turned to the Belgrade Waterfront project on the Sava river, apparently putting the ƒåaplja project at hold by 2017, if not abandoning it completely.

History  The International Quilt Museum was founded in 1997 when native Nebraskans Ardis and Robert James donated their collection of nearly 950 quilts to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Their contribution became the centerpiece of what is now the largest publicly held quilt collection in the world. Through private funds from the University of Nebraska Foundation and a lead gift from the James family, the center opened in its new location in 2008. The glass and brick ‚Äúgreen‚Äù building, designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, houses the quilts, a state-of-the-art research and storage space, educational displays, and custom-crafted galleries where selections from the collections and special exhibitions are shown to the public on a rotating basis. In 2015, the museum opened a privately funded expansion that doubled its collections storage and gallery space. In July 2019, the museum changed its name to the International Quilt Museum or IQM. The quilts range from early examples of American and European quilts to contemporary studio quilts and international quilts. The collection now numbers more than 6000 quilts from fifty countries, dating from the 17th century to the present. Faculty and curatorial staff, visiting scholars and graduate student researchers pursue the study of the world's quilt heritage at the center, and an ongoing acquisitions program seeks to document the full scope of global quilting traditions. The museum publishes catalogues to accompany some of its exhibitions, and these have included Wild by Design, Quilts in Common, American Quilts in the Modern Age 1870 - 1940, Perspectives: Art, Craft, Design and the Studio Quilt, and Marseille: The Cradle of White Corded Quilting. The museum is located at 1523 N. 33rd Street in Lincoln, NE.

The same applies to proof by assertion, where an unproved or disproved claim is asserted as true on no ground other than that of its truth having been asserted.  History  The name of this fallacy is derived from a famous incident in which Dr. Samuel Johnson claimed to disprove Bishop Berkeley's immaterialist philosophy (that there are no material objects, only minds and ideas in those minds) by kicking a large stone and asserting, \\"I refute it thus.\\" This action, which is said to fail to prove the existence of the stone outside the ideas formed by perception, is said to fail to contradict Berkeley's argument, and has been seen as merely dismissing it.  Example  : Speaker A: Infectious diseases are caused by microbes. : Speaker B: What a ridiculous idea! : Speaker A: How so? : Speaker B: It's obviously ridiculous.

S. Department of Agriculture and distributed by the U.S. Forest Service, featuring Laurel and Hardy, with narration read by MGM announcer and producer Pete Smith. Plot outline To Pete Smith's voice over commentary, Stan and Ollie-seemingly picked at random in the street, and professing not to have any wood in their possession at the time, produce various props - the contents of a suitcase and their wallets - all manufactured from wood, or containing wood byproducts. (At one point Ollie even indicates that Stan's head is made of wood, to Stan's annoyance.) The props demonstrate the omnipresence of wood products in the American economy, including paper, cellulose-based artificial leather, rayon, witch hazel, and bioplastics in consumer items (this was in the early days of mass-produced plastic, before petrochemical plastics became widespread). Production background The Tree in a Test Tube is Laurel and Hardy's only known surviving professionally shot color film, shot in Kodachrome on 16mm. The Rogue Song (1930), made in Technicolor and featuring the duo in their only other known professional color footage, is now considered a lost film, although a number of fragments have survived; some home movies of the two in the 1950s also exist in color. Their routine lasts around five minutes and was shot silent; Laurel does not audibly speak, but Hardy makes two utterances (laughter and an utterance of \\"Ain't that the truth!\\") that were dubbed into Smith's audio track. The second half of the film is unrelated documentary film footage, which shifts focus toward wood's importance to the World War II victory effort. Included in the documentary footage are visits to a research laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin and a demonstration at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in which an elephant stands on a piece of laminated veneer lumber without breaking it. Laurel and Hardy shot this brief film during their lunch hour on the back lot of Twentieth Century-Fox on November 29, 1941, while they were filming Jitterbugs, and the film went into release in spring of 1942.Potts, Mark.

The disengagement theory of aging states that \\"aging is an inevitable, mutual withdrawal or disengagement, resulting in decreased interaction between the aging person and others in the social system he belongs to\\". The theory claims that it is natural and acceptable for older adults to withdraw from society. There are multiple variations on disengagement theory, such as moral disengagement. Disengagement theory was formulated by Cumming and Henry in 1961 in the book Growing Old and was the first theory of aging that social scientists developed. Thus, the theory has historical significance in gerontology. Since then, it has faced strong criticism since the theory was proposed as innate, universal, and unidirectional. The disengagement theory is one of three major psychosocial theories which describe how people develop in old age. The other two major psychosocial theories are the activity theory and the continuity theory, and the disengagement theory comes to odds with both. Postulates Cumming and Henry provided the following nine postulates for the \\"process of disengagement\\": *Postulate 1: Everyone expects death, and one's abilities will likely deteriorate over time. As a result, every person will lose ties to others in his or her society. *Postulate 2: Because individual interactions between people strengthen norms, an individual who has fewer varieties of interactions has greater freedom from the norms imposed by interaction. Consequently, this form of disengagement becomes a circular or self- perpetuating process. *Postulate 3: Because men have a centrally instrumental role in America, and women a socioemotional one, disengagement differs between men and women. *Postulate 4: The individual's life is punctuated by ego changes. For example, aging, a form of ego change, causes knowledge and skill to deteriorate. However, success in an industrialized society demands certain knowledge and skill. To satisfy these demands, age-grading ensures that the young possess sufficient knowledge and skill to assume authority and the old retire before they lose their skills. This kind of disengagement is effected by the individual, prompted by either ego changes or the organisation‚Äîwhich is bound to organisational imperatives‚Äîor both. *Postulate 5: When both the individual and society are ready for disengagement, complete disengagement results. When neither is ready, continuing engagement results. When the individual is ready and society is not, a disjunction between the expectations of the individual and of the members of this social systems results, but engagement usually continues. When society is ready and the individual is not, the result of the disjunction is usually disengagement. *Postulate 6: Man's central role is work, and woman's is marriage and family. If individuals abandon their central roles, they drastically lose social life space, and so suffer crisis and demoralisation unless they assume the different roles required by the disengaged state. *Postulate 7: This postulate contains two main concepts. **(a) Readiness for disengagement occurs if: ***An individual is aware of the shortness of life and scarcity of time. ***Individuals perceive their life space decreasing. ***A person loses ego energy. **(b) Each level of society grants individuals permission to disengage because of the following: ***Requirements of the rational-legal occupational system in an affluent society ***The nature of the nuclear family ***The differential death rate *Postulate 8: Fewer interactions and disengagement from central roles lead to the relationships in the remaining roles changing. In turn, relational rewards become more diverse, and vertical solidarities are transformed to horizontal ones. *Postulate 9: Disengagement theory is independent of culture, but the form it takes is bound by culture.

Breeding American Eclipse was bred on Long Island, New York by General Nathaniel Coles. He was by Duroc (by the founding stallion Diomed), out of Miller's Damsel (known as the \\"Queen of the Northern Turf,\\" by Messenger). Miller‚Äôs Damsel‚Äôs dam was a mare (foaled in 1792) by Pot8os, who was by the original Eclipse. The horse was a chestnut stallion that stood 15 hands 1 inch high and was named after the great English champion Eclipse. The original Eclipse (1764 to 1789), about whom it was said: \\"Eclipse first‚Äîthe rest nowhere,\\" was so outstanding that many people named their horses Eclipse in the hope that they had another horse of his quality. Racing record Coles didn't start American Eclipse until he was a three-year-old, and then he raced him sparingly. He had a few race starts at four and was victorious each time. He was, according to many who saw him, the greatest American racehorse of his day. At five, he raced for Cornelius W. Van Ranst, who had purchased him from Coles for $3,000. At five, he maintained his form, but Van Ranst put him out to stud at six. At ages six and seven, he bred to a number of mares for a fee of $12.50. To assist the newly opened Union Course, Van Ranst put the horse back into training. In his next start, he defeated the good mare Lady Lightfoot (a winner of 31 races), by Sir Archy, in the first heat. He distanced her in the second heat when they were the only starters since all others had withdrawn. In his next race, all other horses scratched after contesting American Eclipse in the first heat, except Sir Walter who lost. At this point, a match race was organized between American Eclipse and James J. Harrison‚Äôs noted horse Sir Charles. Sir Charles, with 20 wins to his credit, injured himself in a workout, and Harrison was required to forfeit the match, which American Eclipse won. A second match was arranged only a single heat, and this time Sir Charles raced but broke down, leaving American Eclipse an easy winner.Thoroughbred Heritage Retrieved 2011-1-28 =American Eclipse versus Sir Henry match Race= When American Eclipse was nine years old, another challenge was issued with the intent to race five top horses against American Eclipse, who would represent the North. The race was to be run six months from the date of the challenge over the old Long Island Union Course. (This kind of thing was often done, with no one knowing what condition a horse might be in after six months, and in this case, with the South not having to name the horses challenging.) The South's noted horseman William Johnson trained six horses from the South before deciding that Henry was to race American Eclipse. The race was to be decided with the best two of three four- mile heats for a purse of $10,000. Over 60,000 people attended to see American Eclipse contest Henry (three years old and by Sir Archy). Also racing were John Richards and Washington, not tested at such a distance, but with so much time before the race, their owners intended that they would be. By the time the race came round, two Southern horses had pulled out: Washington for proving not good enough in his training, and John Richards for injury.Montgomery, E.S, \\"The Thoroughbred\\", Arco, New York, 1973 Among the great crowd at Union Course on May 27, 1823 was Andrew Jackson, then American governor of Florida. So were the Vice-President of the United States, Daniel Tompkins, and the infamous Aaron Burr, who had shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel about 19 years earlier (July 11, 1804). Racing against Henry and ridden by William Crafts, American Eclipse lost the first heat by a length (the only time he was ever beaten) to Henry, whose time of 7.37 was the best yet seen in America over four miles. American Eclipse, at nine, carried 126 pounds (57 kg), while his much younger rival carried 108 pounds (49 kg). The famed turf historian Cadwallader R. Colden (who wrote under the name \\"An Old Turfman‚Äù) said that American Eclipse was ridden badly by Crafts, who whipped and spurred him in the first heat. William Crafts was replaced after this heat by the noted Samuel Purdy, who had retired but gladly rode a horse he'd ridden in his youth. In the second heat, American Eclipse raced close to Henry and won this heat. In the third and last heat, the horses were exhausted, but American Eclipse was more seasoned and won by three lengths, to the jubilation of the North. In his eight race starts, he won eight times, earning $25,000. Stud record American Eclipse was sold at a public auction for $8,050 to Walter Livingstone, who permanently retired him to stud in New York. There he sired his best son, Medoc. Then he was sent to Virginia and finally, in 1837, to Kentucky. American Eclipse produced numerous stakes winners and others including Ariel, a filly who won 42 of 57 starts, including 18 four-mile heats; Black Maria (out of Lady Lightfoot, his old rival) who won 11 races with three- and four-mile heats; Lize (second dam of Enquirer); Ten Broeck (not the Nantura Farm Ten Broeck); Monmouth Eclipse; Bay Maria; and Gano.Morris, Simon; Tesio Power 2000 - Stallions of the World, Syntax Software Last owned by Jilson Yates, American Eclipse died in Shelby County, Kentucky, in August 1847, when he was 33 years old.

Hakoinen Castle (Hakoisten linnavuori in Finnish) is the ruins of a fortification on a hill in Janakkala, Finland. Dated to the medieval period, the fortification was situated on a very steep- sided rock by Lake Kernaala (Kernaalanj√§rvi) in a manner reminiscent of the hill fort tradition. The top of the rock is above the water level of the lake. Today very little remains of the castle. Equally little is known about its origins. The name of the castle is not historical and was taken from the nearby Hakoinen mansion (Haga g√•rd in Swedish). The original name is not known, but it may have been \\"H√§me Castle\\" (Tavastehus in Swedish) which today is used for a later castle in the nearby town of H√§meenlinna. A source from 1625 calls Hakoinen as the \\"old Tauaste hus\\".Harrison, Dick. Jarlens sekel. 2002. . See page 572. \\"Tauestahus\\" Castle is first mentioned in sources in 1308.. In Latin. Hosted by the National Board of Antiquities. The castle was probably built at the end of the 13th century or in the early 14th century. It has been speculated that Hakoinen might have been the fort that was attacked by invading Novgorodian forces in 1311 during the Swedish-Novgorodian Wars, as described in the Novgorod Chronicle:Novgorod Chronicle . English translation. :\\"The men of Novgorod went in war over sea to the country of the Germans, against the Finnish (Yem) people -- And the Germans fell back into the citadel. For the place was very strong and firm, on a high rock, not having access from any side. And they sent with greeting, asking for peace, but the men of Novgorod did not grant peace, and they stood three days and three nights wasting the district.\\" Eventually Hakoinen was abandoned. Some activity seems to have continued there until the 1380s. The castle rock was later part of a large estate belonging to the bailiff of H√§me Castle. According to excavations, the castle was divided into two parts. Lower defensive constructions were mostly made of wood. Constructions on the rock were of bricks and rocks. The castle probably had one tower. The site has only been excavated in the early 20th century.

He was the chief developer of Disneyland and then, through his own company, Marco Engineering, he developed other parks in several locations across the country. These theme parks included Freedomland U.S.A. in New York City and Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, Texas. Early life Cornelius Vanderbilt Wood was born in Waynoka, Oklahoma. Throughout his early life, Wood was referred to as Junior and ‚ÄúWoodsy.‚Äù Later on, friends and business colleagues called him ‚ÄúC.V. Wood‚Äù or ‚ÄúC.V.‚Äù or ‚ÄúWoody.‚Äù The family moved to Amarillo, TX following Wood‚Äôs father's promotion within the Santa Fe Railway. After high school, Wood attended Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene and became a champion trick roper for the school‚Äôs Cowboy Marching Band. Wood‚Äôs employment background began during 1941 and included nine years at Convair (formed in 1943 by the merger of Consolidated Aircraft and Vultee Aircraft), an American aircraft manufacturing company that later expanded into rockets and spacecraft. He became a chief industrial engineer and contributed to innovations for the manufacture of aircraft (despite having no degree in engineering). His first supervisor was Fred V. Schumacher, who would reunite with Wood on later projects. Wood was employed by the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) during the early 1950's when he first met Walt Disney. Wood was tapped to lead the team that had been assembled to crunch the numbers and find the location for the park that would become Disneyland. The organization, located in Menlo Park, California, was a nonprofit research and development organization founded by the trustees of Stanford University. The firm later separated from the university in 1970.

He was Disneyland's first employee. At 34 years old, Wood tapped into the brother's ideas to help bring Disneyland to life. Wood worked closely with the Disney brothers and other employees. He also hired his old Texas friends and others he had known at Convair and at the Stanford Research Institute. He also employed set designers, artists, special effects technicians and other talent. Wood offered many ideas for the new entertainment attraction and he exhibited unchecked energy to build it. Wood often said that Walt Disney initially treated him as a son. But, over time, the relationship became strained. The Disney's sometimes were uncomfortable around Wood or, more specifically, with some of his sales and other tactics that he employed to build Disneyland. Walt Disney also raised a number of issues that involved Wood, including that the man he hired was receiving too much credit for Disneyland. Within a year after Disneyland opened, Wood and the Disney's parted ways. Some people who were there at the time said Walt Disney fired Wood. Others said Roy Disney cut the ties. Even others said Wood realized the relationship had soured and left the company. One longtime employee, Bob Gurr, who was loyal to the Disney's, said that Wood was a con man. The word embezzlement had been uttered but this could have been an extreme personal opinion. Another employee, Van Arsdale France, believed that the relationship would not survive, because Wood and Walt Disney both were fiercely independent. Soon after the split, Wood's role in the creation of Disneyland was omitted from all company records and histories. Other ventures After leaving Disneyland, Wood created Marco Engineering, Inc. to design theme parks. Many Disney employees joined him and he had access to the vendors and other talent available to him during the Disneyland days. He billed himself as \\"The Master Planner of Disneyland.\\" A Disney lawsuit stopped him from using that title, but it did not seek financial damages. Wood's firm helped create Magic Mountain (now Heritage Square at Golden, Colorado during 1957, Pleasure Island (in Wakefield, Massachusetts, during 1959, Freedomland U.S.A.(on the current site of Co-op City and its adjacent shopping center in the Bronx, a borough of New York City), during 1960, and initial work on Six Flags Over Texas before Marco employee Randall Duell took over the project. Magic Mountain lasted less than two years and was not completed due to financial issues. Pleasure Island existed from 1959 until 1969, but it too faced considerable financial issues. Freedomland also faced significant financial problems that led to the filing of bankruptcy, but the motive for the failure, unknown to Wood or the public at the time, was to obtain land variances to build the world's largest co-operative housing development on New York City marshland. Six Flags Over Texas continues today as a successful park that has seen many changes from its original concept. The failures of Magic Mountain, Pleasure Island and Freedomland cannot be attributed to Wood. While he and his Marco team created, designed and built the parks, each was managed by local business interests. In the case of Freedomland, the landowner, investors, politicians, city planners and unions maintained other development ideas for the property. About five years after the park was declared bankrupt, the landowner, William Zeckendorf, Sr., publicly acknowledged that the park was a \\"placeholder\\" for the property until land variances were obtained for development. During 1961, Wood merged Marco Engineering with the McCulloch Motors Corporation, which had been a sponsor at Freedomland. Robert Paxton McCulloch had purchased Lake Havasu and other property in Arizona. McCulloch and Wood created the Lake Havasu community, with Wood as the city planner. Wood told McCulloch of the availability of the London Bridge which was being replaced after 130 years of use in London, England. McCulloch purchased the bridge, had it dismantled stone-by-stone, transported it to the U.S., and had it reassembled in Arizona.Andrews, Evan (August 31, 2018) How London Bridge Ended Up In Arizona. Website of The History Channel. Retrieved 2020-07-24. The city's C.V. Wood Community Center is named for Wood. Wood and McCulloch later developed Fountain Hills, Arizona. In 1987, Wood became an assistant to the chairman of Lorimar Telepictures and helped merge the company with Time Warner. He was then retained by Warner Bros. to pioneer its entry into the studio tour attraction business. During 1991, Wood, as president of Warner Bros. Recreational Enterprises Division, played an instrumental role in the design and development of Warner Bros. Movie World theme park in Gold Coast, Queensland Australia. Personal life C.V. Wood was taught Transcendental Meditation by Nancy Cooke de Herrera in the late 1960s. Wood spent nearly 25 years presiding over the annual World Championship Chili Cookoff that he co- founded with race car designer Carroll Shelby and was twice crowned chili cook-off world champion. Wood also had an interest in the unknown, specifically Bigfoot and space aliens. During 1985, Wood received a credited role as a barkeeper in the film Trinity: Good Guys and Bad Guys. In 1991, Wood was accused of sexual harassment by a former administrator at Warner Bros. No further information about the allegation has been documented. At the time of his death from lung cancer, Wood had been married for 20 years to actress Joanne Dru; the sister of actor, singer and television game show host Peter Marshall. Wood was honored by the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) when he was inducted posthumously into its Hall of Fame in 1994. Recently, Wood has received more recognition in books and social media. \\"Three Years in Wonderland\\" (University Press of Mississippi, 2016) by Todd James Pierce is dedicated to the relationship of the Disney Brothers with Wood as they created Disneyland. \\"Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive Story\\" (Theme Park Press, 2019) by Michael R. Virgintino documents the story from conception to bankruptcy of the park, a chapter is dedicated to Wood, and he is referenced throughout the book. References External links * *Discussion of C.V.

The evidence for this statement has been accumulating for more than a century. Studies of benign hallucinatory experiences go back to 1886 and the early work of the Society for Psychical Research,Gurney, E., Myers, F.W.H. and Podmore, F. (1886). Phantasms of the Living, Vols. I and II. London: Trubner and Co..Sidgwick, Eleanor; Johnson, Alice; and others (1894). Report on the Census of Hallucinations, London: Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, Vol. X. which suggested approximately 10% of the population had experienced at least one hallucinatory episode in the course of their life. More recent studies have validated these findings; the precise incidence found varies with the nature of the episode and the criteria of \\"hallucination\\" adopted, but the basic finding is now well-supported.See Slade, P.D. and Bentall, R.P. (1988). Sensory Deception: a scientific analysis of hallucination. London: Croom Helm, for a review.  Types  Of particular interest, for reasons to be discussed below, are those anomalous experiences which are characterised by extreme perceptual realism. =Apparitional experiences= A common type of anomalous experience is the apparitional experience, which may be defined as one in which a subject seems to perceive some person or thing that is not physically present. Self-selected samples tend to report a predominance of human figures, but apparitions of animals,See, for example, Green, C., and McCreery, C. (1975). Apparitions. London: Hamish Hamilton, pp. 192-196. and even objectsApparitions, pp. 197-199. are also reported. Notably, the majority of the human figures reported in such samples are not recognised by the subject, and of those who are, not all are of deceased persons; apparitions of living persons have also been reported.Apparitions, pp. 178-183. =Out-of-body experiences= Out-of- body experiences (OBEs) have become to some extent conflated in the public mind with the concept of the near-death experience. However, the evidence suggests that the majority of out-of-body experiences do not occur near death, but in conditions of either very high or very low arousal.Irwin, H.J. (1985). Flight of Mind: a psychological study of the out-of-body experience. Metuchen, New Jersey: The Scarecrow Press. McCreery McCreery, C. (2008). Dreams and psychosis: a new look at an old hypothesis. Psychological Paper No. 2008-1. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Online PDF has suggested that this latter paradox may be explained by reference to the fact that sleep may be approached, not only by the conventional route of low arousal and deafferentation, but also by the less familiar route of extreme stress and hyper-arousal.Oswald, I. (1962). Sleeping and Waking: Physiology and Psychology. Amsterdam: Elsevier. On this model OBEs represent the intrusion of Stage 1 sleep processes into waking consciousness. OBEs can be regarded as hallucinatory in the sense that they are perceptual or quasi-perceptual experiences in which by definition the ostensible viewpoint is not coincident with the physical body of the subject. Therefore, the normal sensory input, if any, that the subject is receiving during the experience cannot correspond exactly to the perceptual representation of the world in the subject's consciousness. As with hallucinatory experiences in general, attempts to survey samples of the general population have suggested that such experiences are relatively common, incidence figures of between 15 and 25 percent being commonly reported.See Irwin, op.cit., for a review. The variation is presumably to be accounted for by the different types of populations sampled and the different criteria of ‚Äòout-of-body experience‚Äô used. =Dreams and lucid dreams= A dream has been defined by some (e.g. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica) as a hallucinatory experience during sleep. A lucid dream may be defined as one in which the dreamer is aware that he or she is asleep and dreaming. The term ‚Äòlucid dream‚Äô was first used by the Dutch physician Frederik van Eeden,van Eeden, F. (1913). A study of dreams. Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, 26, Part 47, pp. 431-461. who studied his own dreams of this type. The word ‚Äòlucid‚Äô refers to the fact that the subject has achieved insight into his or her condition, rather than the perceptual quality of the experience. Nevertheless, it is one of the features of lucid dreams that they can have an extremely high quality of perceptual realism, to the extent that the dreamer may spend time examining and admiring the perceptual environment and the way it appears to imitate that of waking life.See Green, C. (1968). Lucid Dreams. London: Hamish Hamilton, for examples. Lucid dreams by definition occur during sleep, but they may be regarded as hallucinatory experiences in the same way as non-lucid dreams of a vivid perceptual nature may be regarded as hallucinatory, that is they are examples of 'an experience having the character of sense perception, but without relevant or adequate sensory stimulation [‚Ä¶]' Drever, (1952). A Dictionary of Psychology. London: Penguin. False awakenings A false awakening is one in which the subject believes he/she has woken up, whether from a lucid or a non-lucid dream, but is in fact still asleep.Cf. Green C. and McCreery C. (1994). Lucid Dreaming: the Paradox of Consciousness During Sleep. London: Routledge. Chapter 7. Sometimes the experience is so realistic perceptually (the sleeper seeming to wake in his or her own bedroom, for example) that insight is not achieved at once, or even until the dreamer really wakes up and realises that what has occurred was hallucinatory. Such experiences seem particularly liable to occur to those who deliberately cultivate lucid dreams. However, they may also occur spontaneously and be associated with the experience of sleep paralysis. =Laboratory-induced hallucinations= Psychotic-like symptoms, such as hallucinations and unusual perceptual experience, involve gross alterations in the experience of reality. Normal perception is substantially constructive and what we perceive is strongly influenced by our prior experiences and expectancies. Healthy individuals prone to hallucinations, or scoring highly on psychometric measures of positive schizotypy, tend to show a bias toward reporting stimuli that did not occur under perceptually ambiguous experimental conditions.Bentall R.P, & Slade P.D. (1985). Reality testing and auditory hallucinations: a signal detection analysis. British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 24, 159 ‚Äì169.Tsakanikos, E. & Reed, P. (2005). Seeing words that are not there: detection biases in psychometric schizotypy. British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 44, 295-299 During visual detection of fast-moving words, undergraduate students scoring highly on positive schizotypy had significantly high rates of false perceptions of words (i.e. reported seeing words that were not included in the experimental trials).Tsakanikos, E. & Reed, P. (2005). Do positive schizotypal symptoms predict false perceptual experiences in non- clinical population? Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 193, 809-812. Positive schizotypal symptoms in healthy adults seem to predict false perceptions in laboratory tasks and certain environmental parameters such as perceptual loadTsakanikos, E. (2006). Perceptual biases and positive schizotypy: the role of perceptual load. Personality and Individual Differences, 41, 951-958. and frequency of visual targets Reed, P., Wakefield, D., Harris, J., Parry, J., Cella, M. & Tsakanikos, E. (2008). Seeing non- existing events: effects of environmental conditions, schizotypal symptoms and sub-clinical characteristics. Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 39, 276-291. are critical in the generation of false perceptions. When detection of events becomes either effortless or cognitively demanding, generation of such biases can be prevented.Tsakanikos, E. (2006). Perceptual biases and positive schizotypy: the role of perceptual load. Personality and Individual Differences, 41, 951-958. Subtypes =Auditory hallucinations= Auditory hallucinations, and in particular the hearing of a voice, are thought of as particularly characteristic of people suffering from schizophrenia. However, normal subjects also report auditory hallucinations to a surprising extent. For example, Bentall and SladeBentall R. P. and Slade P. D. (1985). Reliability of a scale measuring disposition towards hallucination: a brief report. Personality and Individual Differences, 6, 527‚Äì529. found that as many as 15.4% of a population of 150 male students were prepared to endorse the statement \\"In the past I have had the experience of hearing a person's voice and then found that no one was there\\". They add: > \\"no less than 17.5% of the [subjects] were prepared to score the item 'I > often hear a voice speaking my thoughts aloud' as 'Certainly Applies'. This > latter item is usually regarded as a first-rank symptom of schizophrenia > ...\\" Green and McCreeryGreen and McCreery, Apparitions, op.cit. p. 85. found that 14% of their 1800 self-selected subjects reported a purely auditory hallucination, and of these nearly half involved the hearing of articulate or inarticulate human speech sounds. An example of the former would be the case of an engineer facing a difficult professional decision, who, while sitting in a cinema, heard a voice saying, \\"loudly and distinctly\\": ‚ÄòYou can't do it, you know\\". He adds: > \\"It was so clear and resonant that I turned and looked at my companion who > was gazing placidly at the screen ... I was amazed and somewhat relieved > when it became apparent that I was the only person who had heard > anything.\\"Apparitions, pp. 85‚Äì86. This case would be an example of what Posey and LoschPosey, T. B. and Losch, M. E. (1983). Auditory hallucinations of hearing voices in 375 normal subjects. Imagination, Cognition and Personality, 3, 99‚Äì113. call \\"hearing a comforting or advising voice that is not perceived as being one's own thoughts\\". They estimated that approximately 10% of their population of 375 American college students had this type of experience. It has been suggested that auditory hallucinations are affected by culture, to the extent that when American subjects were examined they reported hearing stern authoritarian voices with violent or prohibitive suggestions, whereas voices heard in India and Africa tended to be playful and collaborative instead. Hypnogogic and hypnopompic hallucinations occur in people without other symptoms and are considered non-pathological. =Sense of presence= This is a paradoxical experience in which the person has a strong feeling of the presence of another person, sometimes recognised, sometimes unrecognised, but without any apparently justifying sensory stimulus. The nineteenth-century American psychologist and philosopher William James described the experience thus: > \\"From the way in which this experience is spoken of by those who have had > it, it would appear to be an extremely definite and positive state of mind, > coupled with a belief in the reality of its object quite as strong as any > direct sensation ever gives. And yet no sensation seems to be connected with > it at all ... The phenomenon would seem to be due to a pure conception > becoming saturated with the sort of stinging urgency which ordinarily only > sensations bring.\\"James, W. (1890; 1950). Principles of Psychology, Volume > II. New York, Dover Publications, pp. 322‚Äì323. The following is an example of this type of experience: > \\"My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, > I felt him standing beside me during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would > see him if I turned my head. The feeling was so strong I was reduced to > tears. I had not been thinking of him before I felt his presence. I had not > had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.\\"Green > and McCreery, Apparitions, op.cit., p. 118. Experiences of this kind appear to meet all but one of the normal criteria of hallucination. For example, Slade and Bentall proposed the following working definition of a hallucination: > \\"Any percept-like experience which (a) occurs in the absence of an > appropriate stimulus, (b) has the full force or impact of the corresponding > actual (real) perception, and (c) is not amenable to direct and voluntary > control by the experiencer.\\"Slade and Bentall, op.cit., p. 23. The experience quoted above certainly meets the second and third of these three criteria. One might add that the \\"presence\\" in such a case is experienced as located in a definite position in external physical space. In this respect it may be said to be more hallucinatory than, for example, some hypnagogic imagery, which may be experienced as external to the subject but located in a mental \\"space\\" of its own. Leaning, F. E. (1925). An introductory study of hypnagogic phenomena. Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, 35, 289‚Äì409. Mavromatis, A. (1987). Hypnagogia: the Unique State of Consciousness Between Wakefulness and Sleep. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. Other explanations for this phenomenon were discussed by the psychologist Graham Reed who wrote that such experiences may involve illusion, misinterpretation or suggestion. He noted that the experiences are usually reported at moments of fatigue, stress, or during the night.Reed, Graham. (1988). The Psychology of Anomalous Experience. Prometheus Books. pp. 44‚Äì45. In bereavement The experience of sensing the presence of a deceased loved one is a commonly reported phenomenon in bereavement. It can take the form of a clearly sensory impression or can involve a quasi-sensory 'feeling' of presence. Rees Rees, W.D. (1971). \\"The hallucinations of widowhood\\". British Medical Journal, 4, 37‚Äì41. conducted a study of 293 widowed people living in a particular area of mid-Wales. He found that 14% of those interviewed reported having had a visual hallucination of their deceased spouse, 13.3% an auditory one and 2.7% a tactile one. These categories overlapped to some extent as some people reported a hallucinatory experience in more than one modality. Of interest in light of the previous heading was the fact that 46.7% of the sample reported experiencing the presence of the deceased spouse. Other studies have similarly reported a frequency of approximately 50% in the bereaved population. Datson, S. L., & Marwit, S. J. (1997). Personality constructs and perceived presence of deceased loved ones. Death Studies, 21, 131‚Äì146. Olson, P. R., Suddeth, J. A., Peterson, P. A., & Egelhoff, C. (1985). Hallucinations of widowhood. Journal of the American Geriatric Society, \\"33\\", 543‚Äì547. Sensing the presence of the deceased may be a cross-cultural phenomenon that is, however, interpreted differently depending on the cultural context in which it occurs. Steffen, E., & Coyle, A. (2012). Sense of presence' experiences in bereavement and their relationship to mental health: A critical examination of a continuing controversy\\". In C. Murray (Ed.). Mental health and anomalous experience, New York: Nova Science Publishers. For example, one of the earliest studies of the phenomenon published in a Western peer-reviewed journal investigated the grief experiences of Japanese widows and found that 90% of them reported to have sensed the deceased. Yamamoto, J., Okonogi, K., I wasaki, T., & Yoshimura, S. (1969). Mourning in Japan. American Journal of Psychiatry, 125, 1660‚Äì1665. It was observed that, in contrast to Western interpretations, the widows were not concerned about their sanity and made sense of the experience in religious terms. In the Western world, much of the bereavement literature of the 20th century had been influenced by psychoanalytic thinking and viewed these experiences as a form of denial, in the tradition of Freud's interpretation in Mourning and Melancholia of the bereaved person as 'clinging to the object through the medium of a hallucinatory wishful psychosis'. Freud, S. (1917). \\"Mourning and melancholia\\". In J. Strachey (Ed. and trans.). The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud (Vol. XIV) (pp. 252‚Äì268). London: Hogarth Press. In recent decades, building on cross-cultural evidence about the adaptiveness of such experiences, the continuing bonds perspective as originated by Klass et al. (1996) Klass, D., Silverman, P. R., & Nickman, S. (Eds.). (1996). Continuing bonds: New understandings of grief. Bristol: Taylor & Francis. has suggested that such experiences can be seen as normal and potentially adaptive in a Western context too. Since then, a number of qualitative studies have been published, describing the mainly beneficial effects of these experiences, especially when they are made sense of in spiritual or religious ways Kwilecki, S. (2011). \\"Ghosts, meaning, and faith: After-death communications in bereavement narratives\\". Death Studies\\", 35, 219‚Äì243. Steffen, E., & Coyle, A. (2011). \\"Sense of presence experiences and meaning-making in bereavement: A qualitative analysis\\". Death Studies, 35, 579‚Äì609. While most of these experiences tend to be reported as comforting to the perceiver, a small percentage of people have reported disturbing experiences, and there is ongoing research, for example by Field and others, Field, N. P., & Filanosky, C. (2010). Continuing bonds, risk factors for complicated grief, and adjustment to bereavement. Death Studies, 34, 1‚Äì29. to determine when continuing bonds experiences serve adjustment to bereavement and when they may be detrimental.  Theoretical implications  =Psychological= The main importance of anomalous experiences such as benign hallucinations to theoretical psychology lies in their relevance to the debate between the disease model versus the dimensional model of psychosis. According to the disease model, psychotic states such as those associated with schizophrenia and manic-depression, represent symptoms of an underlying disease process, which is dichotomous in nature; i.e. a given subject either does or does not have the disease, just as a person either does or does not have a physical disease such as tuberculosis. According to the dimensional model, by contrast, the population at large is ranged along a normally distributed continuum or dimension, which has been variously labelled as psychoticism (H.J.Eysenck), schizotypy (Gordon Claridge) or psychosis- proneness.For a discussion of the concept of schizotypy and its variants, cf. McCreery, C. and Claridge, G. (2002). Healthy schizotypy: the case of out-of- the-body experiences. Personality and Individual Differences, 32, 141-154. The occurrence of spontaneous hallucinatory experiences in persons who are enjoying good physical health at the time, and who are not drugged or in other unusual physical states of a transient nature such as extreme fatigue, would appear to provide support for the dimensional model.Berrios G E (2005) On Fantastic Apparitions of Vision and Johannes M√ºller. History of Psychiatry 16: 229-246. The alternative to this view requires one to posit some hidden or latent disease process, of which such experiences are a symptom or precursor, an explanation which would appear to beg the question. =Philosophical= The \\"argument from hallucination\\" has traditionally been one of those used by proponents of the philosophical theory of representationalism against direct realism. Representationalism holds that when perceiving the world we are not in direct contact with it, as common sense suggests, but only in direct contact with a representation of the world in consciousness. That representation may be a more or less accurate one depending on our circumstances, the state of our health, and so on. Direct realism, on the other hand, holds that the common sense or unthinking view of perception is correct, and that when perceiving the world we should be regarded as in direct contact with it, unmediated by any representation in consciousness. Clearly, during an apparitional experience, for example, the correspondence between how the subject is perceiving the world and how the world really is at that moment is distinctly imperfect. At the same time the experience may present itself to the subject as indistinguishable from normal perception. McCreeryMcCreery, C. (2006). \\"Perception and Hallucination: the Case for Continuity.\\" Philosophical Paper No. 2006-1. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Online PDF has argued that such empirical phenomena strengthen the case for representationalism as against direct realism.
